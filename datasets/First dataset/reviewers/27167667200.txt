84930473243	Molecular characteristics and expression of calmodulin cDNA from the freshwater pearl mussel, Hyriopsis schlegelii	Calmodulin (CaM) is a multifunctional intracellular calcium ion receptor protein that participates in a range of cellular processes, including calcium metabolism in mussels. To investigate the role of CaM in freshwater mollusk shell calcium metabolism, the full-length CaM cDNA was isolated from the freshwater pearl mussel, Hyriopsis schlegelii (referred to as hsCaM) using SMART RACE technology. The full-length hsCaM was 855 bp in size, containing a 70-bp 5'-untranslated sequence, a 447-bp open reading frame, a 309-bp 3'-untranslated sequence, and a 26-nucleotide long poly(A) tail. The hsCaM mRNA expression in different mussel tissues was examined using real-time PCR. The hsCaM mRNA was found to be ubiquitously expressed, but far more abundant in the gill, foot, and mantle than in the posterior adductor muscle. Real-time PCR was also used to determine hsCaM mRNA expression levels in mantle tissues of H. schlegelii at different ages. No significant differences between one-, two-, and threeyear-old mussels were detected, but expression increased in four-yearold mussels and then decreased in five-year-old mussels. CaM appears to be involved in calcium regulation of the mantle in four-year-old mussels, which may secrete more mother of pearl during pearl culture. © FUNPEC-RP.

16244417810	Activation of the caspase-8/Bid and Bax pathways in aspirin-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer	Aspirin-induced apoptosis is one of the important mechanisms for its antitumour effect against gastric cancer. We aimed at investigating the involvement of bcl-2 family members in the apoptotic pathway in gastric cancer. Gastric cancer cell line AGS and MKN-45 were observed as to cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in response to treatment with aspirin. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis was determined by 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Protein expression was determined by western blotting. We showed that aspirin activated caspase-8, caspase-9 and capase-3, cleaved and translocated Bid, induced a conformational change in and translocation of Bax and cytochrome c release. In addition, suppression of caspase-8 with the specific inhibitor z-IETD-fmk, as well as the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, prevented Bid cleavage and subsequent apoptosis. The caspase inhibitors failed to abolish the effects on Bax activation. In conclusion, our results identify a role of caspase-8/Bid and activation of Bax as a novel mechanism for aspirin-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.

14744276521	Inhibition of antisense oligonucleotides on EGFR expression and proliferation of RPE cell in vivo	Objective: To study the effect of antisense epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) oligonucleotides (ODN) on EGFR expression and proliferation of cultured retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. Methods: Using cationic liposome-mediated method, EGFR antisense ODN(ASODN) were transferred into human RPE cells, and EGFR gene and protein expression were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. Cell hyperplasia was evaluated by cell cycle analysis and MTT. Results: The inhibitory rate of transferred antisense EGFR ODN on protein expression of EGFR was 66. 45% at 24 hours, and that on EGFR mRNA expression was 35. 2%. The inhibitory rate of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (MSODN) with lipofectin on RPE cell proliferation was 40%, and missense oligodeoxynucleotides showed no such effect (P < 0. 01). Cell cycle analysis showed a significant decrease in S phase and a remarkable increase in G1/G0 fraction after exposure to antisense EGFR ODN in comparison with missense oligonucleotide-treated cells at the corresponding time. Conclusion: The transfer of antisense EGFR ODN into cultured RPE cells can effectively suppress EGFR mRNA and protein expression as well as proliferation o RPE cells.

17644388748	Expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor in retina following the injury of optic nerve in rat	Objective: To study the expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor α receptor subunit (CNTFR α) in the retina of rat after optic nerve injury. Methods: Expression of CNTFR α mRNA in the retina of rat after optic nerve injury was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and their protein products were detected by Western blot test. Results: The signal of CNTFR α mRNA was not detected in normal rat retina but was found at 1, 7, 14, 28 days after optic nerve injury. Conclusion: As a result of crushing injury, the expression level of CNTF down-regulated soon after a transitorily up-regulation, but CNTFR α was constitutively expressed in retina after injury. These facts suggest that exogenous CNTF might provide a supportive environment for axonal regeneration and might play a protective role in the retinal recovery.

21344454476	Effects of betagan and alphagan on the proliferation of human ciliary epithelial cells in vitro	Objective: To compare the effects of two antiglaucoma drugs (levobunlol and brimonidine) on cultured human non-pigment ciliary epithelial (NPE) cells and evaluate the safety of the two drugs. Methods: NPE cells from the non-pigment layer were dissected and passaged, and 4 μg/mL betagan or alphagan were added to the medium. Flow cytometry were used to detect the proliferation of cultured NPE cells. Total protein was acquired by split method, and the effect of the two drugs on the NPE cells were compared with untreated control. Results: As compared to the control, betagan had no significant effect on the cell cycle, while alphagan could promote the synthesis of cells in S passage, thus promoting the proliferation of cells. Both drugs increased the production of total cellular proteins. At 24 hours after treatment, the concentration of the total protein was 2 183.8 ± 145.34 μg/mL in control group vs 3 382.82 ± 28.10 μg/mL of betagan group(P = 0.000) and 6 281.3 ± 128.97 μg/mL of alphagan group (P = 0.000), respectively. Conclusion: Both drugs do not suppress the proliferation of NPE cells, indicating their role in NPE survival.

23144456713	Role of protein kinase C on the alteration of retinal endothelin-1 in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats	Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of PKC on the alteration of retinal endothelin-1 in 2-week streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The measurement of retinal PKC activities from membranous and cytosolic fractions was conducted by ELISA. Retinal tissues were analysed for the expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1), endothelin-3 (ET-3), endothelin-A (ET-A), and endothelin-B (ET-B) mRNA by means of semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Retinal vasculature isolated by trypsin digest technique was immunostained for ET-1. We followed the alteration of retinal ET-1 after intravitreal injection of a general PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, in 2-week diabetic rats. Retinal PKC specific activities were significantly increased by 37% (P=0·027) in the membranous fraction in diabetic rats compared with normal rats, whereas PKC specific activities in the cytosolic fraction were unchanged. The retina from the diabetic rats showed increased ET-1 mRNA expression after 2 weeks, while no changes were found for ET-3, ET-A and ET-B. ET-1 immunoreactivity was also increased in the retinal vasculature of diabetic rats. Retinal ET-1 expression was decreased after intravitreal injection of GF109203X (10

33746597894	Update on clarithromycin resistance in Helicobacter pylori in Hong Kong and its effect on clarithromycin-based triple therapy	Aim: To determine the antibiotic susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori and evaluate the efficacy of a clarithromycin-based triple therapy in relation to antibiotic resistance. Methods: Consecutive patients referred for upper endoscopy due to dyspeptic symptoms were recruited. Gastric biopsies were obtained for the CLO test, histology and culture. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed by the E-test. Patients with H. pylori infection received rabeprazole20 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and amoxicillin 1,000 mg, all twice daily for 7 days. Results: Of 234 patients recruited, 124 were H. pylori-positive and culture was successful in 102 patients. The updated prevalences of resistance to clarithromycin, amoxicillin and metronidazole were 7.8, 0 and 39.2%, respectively. A total of 86 patients received 1-week triple therapy with rabeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and amoxicillin 1,000 mg, all twice daily, and 81 patients attended the follow-up test. Eradication rates by per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis were 92.6 and 87.2%, respectively. The eradication rate by per protocol was significantly higher in patients with clarithromycin-susceptible strains than in those with clarithromycin-resistant strains (98.6 vs. 28.6%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Clarithromycin resistance reduces the clinical efficacy of clarithromycin-based triple therapy. However, due to the low prevalence of clarithromycin resistance, clarithromycin-based therapy is still the first choice for clinical use. Copyright © 2006 S. Karger AG.

33746646010	Inhibition of Akt/PKB by a COX-2 inhibitor induces apoptosis in gastric cancer cells	Background/Aim: Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 has been proposed to be a potential mechanism for the chemoprevention of gastrointestinal tumors by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This study investigates the mechanisms by which the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor SC236 induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cell lines and its downstream signaling pathway. Methods: Two gastric cancer cell lines, AGS and MKN28, were treated with SC236 and assessed for cell growth and apoptosis. The involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt kinase/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) pathways and their downstream signalings were studied in the AGS cell line. Results: SC236 treatment induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells and caused activation of p38 and stress-activated protein kinase/jun kinase, but down-regulated Akt/PKB. The specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the dominant-negative stress-activated protein kinase/jun kinase both failed, while the constitutively active form of Akt/PKB was able to block SC236-induced apoptosis. SC236-induced apoptosis was coupled with release of cytochrome c and activation of caspases. Conclusion: One of the pathways involved in SC-236-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells is through down regulation of Akt and then release of cytochrome c. Copyright © 2006 S. Karger AG.

33846024078	Expansion culture and differential induction of rat retinal progenitor cells in vitro	Objective: Many researches have paid close attention on retinal transplantation in the treatment of retinal degenerative disease. Retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) have the ability to differentiate into multiple retinal cells, therefore to study the affecting factor of RPCs differentiation is critic for the rescue of degenerated retinal cells. This work was to investigate the differential potential of cultured rat retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and its' affecting factors. Methods: RPCs were isolated from retina of embryonic SD rat aged 18 days and cultured in suspension or attached condition. After expansion, RPCs were cultured in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM), F12 containing 10 ng/ml ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 2, 3, 4, 6 days of cell attachment, cultured RPCs were identified by immunohistochemistry staining with nestin, Vimentin, Opsin and GFAP. Results: Cultured RPCs showed a sphere shape in suspension and were stained 85% positive for nestin and Vimentin. The suspension RPCs were able to maintain in culture for the first generation. The attached RPCs were survival till the 5th generation, and the cell numbers was decreased with the passage. RPCs could differentiate into complex neurons including photoreceptor cells and glial cells and exhibited brown staining in cytoplasm for Opsin and GFAP. CNTF, bFGF and EGF could improve the ratio of photoreceptor cells differentiation, and FBS markedly increased the numbers of glial cells. Conclusion: RPCs can be successfully cultured and proliferated in vitro. CNTF, bFGF, EGF and FBS participate in the regulation and control of retina development and differentiation.

33947183418	Effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers on retinal vascular endothelial growth factor expression in rat diabetic retinopathy	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a pivotal role in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and hypertension has been identified as an independent risk factor for DR. The aim of the present study was to: (1) explore whether β-adrenergic blockers influence retinal VEGF expression; (2) determine the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on retinal VEGF expression independently of their anti-hypertensive actions; and (3) investigate the correlation between retinal VEGF expression and changes in retinal capillary basement membrane thickness (BMT). Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and control animals were assigned at random to receive the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol, the ACEI fosenopril sodium, or vehicle for 24 weeks. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to assess VEGF protein and mRNA expression. Computer-assisted morphometric measurements of transmission electron microscopy photographs were performed to evaluate BMT. Vitreous fluid and retinal VEGF protein and retinal VEGF mRNA expression were significantly higher in diabetic rats than in control rats, with a significant reduction in fosenopril sodium-treated diabetic rats (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in VEGF levels in diabetic rats and propranolol-treated diabetic rats (p > 0.05), but there was a significant difference in VEGF protein and mRNA expression in propranolol-treated diabetic rats and fosenopril sodium-treated diabetic rats (p < 0.01) without any significant difference in systolic blood pressure in the latter two groups (p > 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the level of retinal VEGF expression and changes in retinal BMT (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that the effect of ACEI on retinal VEGF expression is independent of their anti-hypertensive actions and that ACEI could offer particular benefits beyond blood pressure reduction in the treatment of DR with or without hypertension. β-adrenergic blockers had no influence on retinal VEGF expression in normal or diabetic rats. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

33947321597	Suppression of FHL2 Expression Induces Cell Differentiation and Inhibits Gastric and Colon Carcinogenesis	Background & Aims: FHL2 (4-1/2 LIM protein 2) is an adapter and modifier in protein interactions that is expressed mainly in the heart and ovary. It functions in a cell type- or promoter-specific manner. The aims of this study were to examine its expression in gastrointestinal cancers and to determine its role in cell differentiation and tumorigenesis. Methods: FHL2 expression in cancerous and normal gastrointestinal cells was detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. The effect of FHL2 suppression by both antisense and siRNA methods on cell differentiation and growth were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Results: FHL2 expression was up-regulated in gastrointestinal cancer, compared with matched normal tissues. Stable transfection of gastric cancer cell line, AGS, and colon cancer cell line, Lovo, with antisense FHL2 induced lengthened or shuttle-shape morphologic changes with long or dendritic-like cytoplasmic processes and decreased the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio. FHL2 antisense induced expressions of carinoembryonic antigen and E-cadherin and the maturation of F-actin. Furthermore, FHL2 antisense inhibited the transcriptions of some oncogenes including cox-2, survivin, c-jun, and hTERT, and suppressed the promoter activity of activator protein-1 and hTERT. Suppression of FHL2 inhibited serum-dependent, anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth, and suppressed de novo tumor formation in nude mice xenograft. Conclusions: Suppression of FHL2 induces cell differentiation and inhibits tumorigenesis. Antisense or siRNA methods targeting FHL2 is a promising strategy for treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. © 2007 AGA Institute.

34248335752	XAF1 mediates apoptosis through an extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in colon cancer	BACKGROUND. XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) negatively regulates the function of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), a member of the IAP family that exerts antiapoptotic effects. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is thought to increase cell proliferation and to protect cells from apoptosis. The aim of the study was to investigate the correlation between the ERK1/ 2 signaling pathway and XAF1 in colon cancer. METHODS. Four human colon cancer cell lines, HCT1116 and Lovo (wildtype p53), DLD1 and SW1116 (mutant p53), were used. Lovo stable transfectants with XAF1 sense and antisense were established. The effects of dominant-negative MEK1 (DN-MEK1) and MEK-speciflc inhibitor U0126 on the ERK signaling pathway and expression of XAF1 and XIAP proteins were determined. The transcription activity of core XAF1 promoter was assessed by dual luciferase reporter assay. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis was determined by Hoechst 33258 staining. RESULTS. U0126 increased the expression of XAF1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A similar result was obtained in cells transfected with DN-MEK1 treatment. Conversely, the expression of XIAP was down-regulated. Activity of the putative promoter of the XAF1 gene was significantly increased by U0126 treatment and DN-MEK1 transient transfection. rhEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK appeared to have little or no effect on XAF1 expression. Overexpression of XAF1 was more sensitive to U0126-induced apoptosis, whereas down-regulation of XAF1 by antisense reversed U0126-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS. XAF1 expression was up-regulated by inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway through transcriptional regulation, which required de novo protein synthesis. The results suggest that XAF1 mediates apoptosis induced by the ERK1/2 pathway in colon cancer. © 2007 American Cancer Society.

34347384039	Differentiation of embryonic and postnatal rat retinal progenitor cells in vivo and in vitro	Objective: The seven types of neurons of the retina are differentiated from the same retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). During the development of the retina, different types of neurons emerge according to a definite order and are influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Therefore our study was to investigate the different differential potential of embryonic and postnatal RPCs in vivo and in vitro. Methods: RPCs were isolated from embryonic 18-day-old and postnatal 2-week-old SD rat retina and cultured in suspension and adherent methods. All the culture of RPCs was maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM): F12 containing 10 ng/ml ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 10% retinoid acid and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 2, 3, 5, 6 days of attachment, these cells and rat retina slices of embryonic 18 days, postnatal 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 days were stained by two-step immunohistochemistry staining with nestin, vimentin, opsin and glial filament acid protein (GFAP). Results: Cultured RPCs in suspension presented sphere shape and were stained into brown color in the cytoplasm by nestin. The suspension RPCs was subcultured 1 time and the adherent RPCs could be passed 5 generations. CNTF, bFGF and EGF played the same role in the induction differentiation of RPCs at the 6th day of culture. RPCs were differentiated into neuron-like cells by the functioning of CNTF, bFGF and EGF, showing a long axon with still positive staining for nestin. No opsin positive cells in the cultured RPCs were induced in vitro in the rats of postnatal 2 weeks. Conclusion: RPCs can be cultured and expansed in vitro. During differentiation of RPCs, the shape change of the cultured cell is earlier than that of function.

34548831422	Expression pattern of erythropoietin and erythropoietin receptor in experimental model of retinal detachment	Purpose: Erythropoietin (EPO), known for its role in erythroid cell differentiation, has been suggested to have a neuroprotective effect on retinal neurons. The aim of the current study was to investigate the expression pattern of EPO and erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) in the detached retina of a rat model of retinal detachment (RD). Methods: Forty-eight albino Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into normal control group (n = 6) and RD model group (n = 42). The rat RD model was established by slow injection of 1.4% sodium hyaluronate into the upper half of the subretinal space, in which the upper half of the neurosensory retina was detached from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The expression of EPO and EPOR mRNA/protein was determined at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hr after sodium hyaluronate injection by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Meanwhile, the distributions of EPO and EPOR were examined by immunohistochemistry. Results: EPO and EPOR mRNA levels increased gradually after sodium hyaluronate injection and peaked 48 hr later. EPO mRNA level became significantly higher than that in the normal control group at 12 hr after injection, and EPOR mRNA level became significantly higher at 6 hr (p < 0.05). Moreover, the protein levels of EPO and EPOR presented a similar tendency to the mRNA level and became significantly higher than those in normal control group at 3 hr after injection (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical results showed that both EPO and EPOR were strongly expressed all over the neurosensory retina 48 hr after injection, but EPOR was not found in the rod outer segment. Only weak expression of EPO and EPOR was noticed in the retina of normal control group. Conclusions: The levels of EPO and EPOR in detached retina increase with the duration of retinal detachment and reach their peaks at 48 hr; most layers of detached neurosensory retina can express EPO and EPOR. It is indicated that the EPO/EPOR system might play an important role in protection of retinal neurons during RD; supplementation with exogenous EPO might promote the survival of retinal neurons.

34848901636	Role of pigment epithelium-derived factor on proliferation and migration of choroidal capillary endothelium induced by vascular endothelial growth factor in vitro	Background: Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is expressed in several normal organs and identified as an inhibitor-of neovascularization. In the present study, we investigated the effect of PEDF in an in vitro model of ocular choroidal neovascularization. Methods: Microdissection was used to isolate the human choroidal endothelial cells (CECs), followed by the use of superparamagnetic beads (Dynabeads) coated with the CD31 antibody, which selectively binds to the endothelial cell surface. The mitogenic and motogenic effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on cultured choloidal capillary endothelial cells were examined in the presence or absence of PEDF (1, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/ml) using cell counts and migration assays. Results: Cells bound to the beads were isolated using a magnetic particle concentrator and they were successfully cultured and characterized to be endotheliall cells that possessed greater than 95% immunoreactivity to von Willebrand factor. PEDF suppressed the proliferation and migration of VEGF-induced choroidal capillary endothelial cells. However, the concentration of PEDF which we used has little effect on normal CECs. Conclusions: PEDF played an important role on the growth and migration of VEGF-stimulated choroidal endothelial cell. These findings suggest that PEDF may be an effective approach to the treatment of choroidal neovascular disorders.

The proliferation and adhesion ability of RPE cells was evaluated by MTT assay. The migration ability of RPE cells was observed by microscope. The damage to mtDNA of RPE cell was evaluated by RT-PCR. • Results: TA whose concentration was 0.1, 1g/L (including pure and impure TA) and the pure vehicle inhibited the growth of RPE cells obviously in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control (P < 0.05). TA whose concentration was 0.1 g/L (including pure and impure TA) inhibited the migration of RPE cells at three different timepoints compared with the control (P < 0.05). TA whose concentration was 0.01, 0.1, 1g/L (including pure and impure TA) and vehicle inhibited markedly the adhesion ability of RPE cells at 24, 48 hours compared with the control (P < 0.05). Segments of mtDNA were not significantly lost after RPE cells were treated with TA of varied concentrations (containing vehicle) for 24 hours. • Conclusion: TA inhibits the proliferation, migration and adhesion ability of RPE cells. TA has no obvious effect on mtDNA of RPE cells.

38149058329	Regulation of XAF1 expression in human colon cancer cell by interferon β: Activation by the transcription regulator STAT1	XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a novel tumor suppressor and interferon stimulated gene (ISG). Interferon β (IFNβ) exerts anti-proliferative effect and induces apoptosis through the Jak-Stat signaling cascade by the type I Interferon receptor (IFN-R), which initiates gene transcription of those biological effectors of IFNβ. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of IFNβ on XAF1 expression and the putative mechanisms mediated by the critical role of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (Stat1). Gene expression was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The promoter activity of XAF1 was examined by luciferase reporter assay. The activity of interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (Q-ChIP). Results showed that IFNβ stimulated XAF1 promoter activity in colon cancer cell line DLD1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A high affinity ISRE binding element (ISRE-XAF1) was located in -55 to -66 nt upstream of the first ATG site of XAF1 gene. Deletion of ISRE-XAF1 completely abrogated basal and IFNβ-induced promoter activity. IFNβ-induced XAF1 expression was mediated by Stat1 through the interaction with ISRE-XAF1. Knocking down of the Stat1 expression and blocking its phosphorylation decreased IFNβ-induced XAF1 expression.

39149136857	Erythropoietin protects retinal neurons and glial cells in early-stage streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats	The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) in preventing and reversing dysfunction of retinal neurons and glial cells in early-stage streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Two weeks after STZ [60 mg/kg body weight (b.w.), i.p.] injection, diabetic rats had been administered rhEPO (5000 IU/kg of b.w., i.p.) injection three times weekly for 2 weeks. The changes to the electroretinogram, retina ultrastructure, erythropoietin receptors (EPO-Rs) and the content of glutamate in retinas before and after the experiment in test and control groups were compared. The amplitudes of b-wave and oscillatory potentials (OPs) decreased at the end of the experiment in STZ-induced diabetic rats compared with the age-matched controls, whereas the amplitudes of b-wave and OPs showed no decrease in diabetic rats with rhEPO injection. Mitochondrial metamorphosis in ganglion cells occurred in STZ-induced diabetic rats but was not found in those rats with rhEPO treatment. EPO-Rs in retinas and the retinal glutamate of STZ-induced diabetic rats at the end of the experiment had increased obviously compared with rhEPO-injected diabetic rats. The abnormalities of retinal electrophysiological activity, ganglion cells with swollen mitochondria in the retinas, increased retinal glutamate and EPO-R in the retinas occurred early in the process of the disease course in diabetic rats. These aspects can all be improved by intraperitoneal administered rhEPO. The administration of rhEPO may be useful in the neural treatment of diabetic retinopathy at the early stage. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33644833354	Inhibition of human telomerase reverse transcriptase by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in colon carcinoma	BACKGROUND. Telomerase activation, which is observed in most human cancers, plays an important role in carcinogenesis. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is a subunit of telomerase that is essential for telomerase activity. The aim of the study was to investigate whether nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit telomerase activity and hTERT. METHODS. Four colon carcinoma cell lines, HT-29, COLO205, CRL-2134, and SW1116, were used in the experiments. Polymerase chain reaction-based telomeric repeat amplification (TRAP) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure telomerase activity in the cells after treatment with aspirin, indomethacin, or SC-236 (a specific cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitor). Expression of hTERT mRNA and protein was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. The dual luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify the potential cis-response elements to NSAIDs in the promoter region of hTERT. RESULTS. Aspirin, indomethacin, and SC-236 inhibited telomerase activity in HT-29, COLO205, and CRL-2134 cell lines, but not in the SW1116 cell line. NSAIDs inhibited hTERT mRNA and protein expression through suppression of hTERT transcriptional activity. The hTERT promoter fragment -145 to -330 basepairs (bp) upstream of the ATG starting site was sufficient to respond to the NSAID-induced inhibitory effect and the inhibition was COX-2-independent. CONCLUSION. NSAIDs inhibit telomerase activity at hTERT transcriptional, mRNA, and protein levels in colon carcinoma cells. The hTERT promoter fragment -145 to -330 bp may be the cis-response element to NSAIDs. © 2006 American Cancer Society.

79952260382	Effects of minocycline on leakage of retinal microvessels induced by glycation end products and its mechanism	Background: Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) is an important etiological factor of diabetic retinopathy, and they result in the damage of vascular endothelial cells and apoptosis of perithelial cells. However, it is unclear that how they influence the retina capillary permeability. Objective: Present study was to study the role of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in blood-retinal barrier damage induced by ACEs and explore the therapeutic effects of minocycline, a MMPs inhibitor. Methods: Thirty-six SPF Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups and 12 for each group. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (40 mg/d) was injected via caudal vein in the rats of the control group. AGEs + BSA was used at the same way in 12 rats to establish the blood-retinal barrier damage models. In minocycline group, minocycline (45 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected at the same time of injection of AGEs + BSA at the interval of 1 day in 12 model rats. After 2 weeks of injection, the retinas of experimental animals were obtained. The levels of MMP-9 protein and mRNA in retina were detected by Western blotting and semi-quantitative real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. The permeability of retinal vessels was bio-assayed using the Evans blue method. The correlation between the vessel permeability and the MMP-9 protein levels was analyzed. Results: The gray-scale value of MMP-9 mRNA was 0.86 ± 0.045, 1.12 ± 0.053, 0.91 ± 0.07 in BSA group, AGEs-BSA group and minocycline group, showing a significant difference among three groups (F = 37.090, P = 0.000). Compared with the BSA group, the MMP-9 mRNA level in the retina was significantly increased in AGEs-BSA group (P < 0.05), and that in minocycline group was considerably lower than AGEs-BSA group (P < 0.05). The gray-scale value of MMP-9 protein was 0.204 ± 0.033, 0.512 ± 0.083 and 0.371 ± 0.056 in BSA group, AGEs-BSA group and minocycline group respectively with a significant difference among them (F = 38.470, P = 0.000), and expression of MMP-9 protein was upregulated in AGEs-BSA group (P < 0.05) and downregulated in minocycline group (P < 0.05). The vascular permeability value was evidently higher in rats retinas in AGEs-BSA group compared with BSA group (P < 0.05), however, the value was lower in minocycline group in comparison with AGEs-BSA group (P < 0.05). A positive correlation was found between the MMP-9 protein expression and retinal vascular permeability value (r = 0.891, P = 0.000). Conclusion: MMP-9 is involved in the AGEs-induced retinal vascular permeability, and the abnormal permeability can be partially reversed by minocycline.

84861450620	An experimental study of a modified Dahuang Zhechong pill on theangiogenesis of RF/6A cells in vitro	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a modified Dahuang Zhechong Pill (MDZP) on the angiogenesis of rhesus choroid-retina endothelial (RF/6A) cells and its preliminary mechanism. METHODS: A 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)- 2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) method was used to assess the effect of a MDZP on RF/6A cell proliferation induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Transwell inserts were used to assess the effect of the MDZP on RF/6A cell migration. Matrigel was used to assess the effect of the MDZP on the tube formation of RF/6A cells. Western blotting and quantitative real- time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to detect the protein and mRNA expression, respectively, of VEGF and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in RF/6A cells treated with the MDZP. RESULTS: RF/6A cell proliferation induced by VEGF was inhibited by 0.2 mg/mL MDZP. At 0, 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/mL MDZP, the number of cells that migrated through Transwell membranes was 73.33 ± 4.51, 61.33 ± 4.04, 28.67 ± 6.66 and 17.67 ± 4.16, respectively, and the number of tubes formed in Matrigel was 20.33 ± 0.58, 13.33 ± 1.53, 11.00 ± 1.00 and 1.33±0.58, respectively. At 100 and 200 mg/mL MDZP, the protein and mRNA expression of VEGF and MMP-2 were inhibited in RF/6A cells. At 400 mg/mL MDZP, the expression of VEGF mRNA and MMP-2 protein were inhibited in RF/6A cells. CONCLUSIONS: MDZP inhibits the angiogenesis of RF/6A cells via the suppression of proliferation, migration and tube formation of RF/6A cells. Inhibition of the protein and mRNA expression of VEGF and MMP-2 in RF/6A cells may be an important mechanism. © 2012 JTCM. All rights reserved.

84861507587	Expression of erythropoietin and erythropoietin receptor after light-induced retinal injury in rats	Objective: To investigate the expression of erythropoietin (EPO) and erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) after light-induced retinal injury in rats. Methods: Thirty-two male SD rats were selected, light-induced retinal injury models were established in 29 rats (light-induced retinal injury group), and the other 3 rats were served as normal control group. The retinal tissues of rats in normal control group and those of rats in light-induced retinal injury group at the time points of 0 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 7 d and 14 d after light-induced retinal injury were obtained, the expression of EPO and EPOR protein and mRNA was detected by Western blotting and RT-PCR respectively, and the location of expression of EPO and EPOR protein was determined with immunohistochemical method. Results: Western blotting detection revealed that the expression of EPO and EPOR protein increased after light-induced retinal injury, and reached the peak 48 h after light-induced retinal injury. The relative expression of EPO protein in light-induced retinal injury group was significantly higher than that in normal control group at the time points of 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after light-induced retinal injury (P<0.05 or P<0.01), and the relative expression of EPOR protein in light-induced retinal injury group was significantly higher than that in normal control group at the time points of 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 7 d and 14 d after light-induced retinal injury (P<0.05 or P<0.01). RT-PCR detection demonstrated that the expression of EPO and EPOR mRNA increased after light-induced retinal injury, and reached the peak 24 h and 48 h after light-induced retinal injury respectively. The relative expression of EPO mRNA in light-induced retinal injury group was significantly higher than that in normal control group at the time points of 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 7 d and 14 d after light-induced retinal injury (P<0.05 or P<0.01), and the relative expression of EPOR mRNA in light-induced retinal injury group was significantly higher than that in normal control group at the time points of 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 7 d and 14 d after light-induced retinal injury (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Immunohistochemical observation indicated that 24 h after light-induced retinal injury, the expression of EPOR protein was slightly enhanced and that of EPO protein was relatively lower in the outer and inner segment of photoreceptor. Conclusion The expression of EPO and EPOR protein and mRNA in retinal tissues may time-dependently increase after light-induced retinal injury in rats, which indicates that endogenous EPO and EPOR may participate in the restoration mechanism of light-induced retinal injury.

84861854635	Molecular characteristics of mitochondrial DNA and phylogenetic analysis of the loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus) from the Poyang Lake	The goal of our study was to investigate the molecular characteristics of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and phylogenetic construction of the weather loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus) in Poyang Lake. The complete mitochondrial genome was 16,634 bp, and the gene order was identical to that of teleost fishes. Compared with the previous reported weather loach in China, there were numerous nucleotide substitutions and length polymorphisms on the structural genes of mitochondrial DNA in the loach from the Poyang Lake. The Phylogenetic tree indicated that the loach had its own molecular characteristics and was somewhat different from those in other regions of China. Fourteen unique haplotypes of the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene were obtained from 300 weather loaches. The Phylogenetic tree based on the cyt b gene showed that the loaches were substructured into two different populations in The Poyang Lake. Results indicated that the loaches in Poyang Lake not only showed the same phylogeny as the loaches in other areas of China, but also generated its own unique phylogenetic relationships.

84897909065	HIV-TAT mediated protein transduction of heme oxygenase-1 protects HaCaT cells from ionizing radiation	Objectives: To elucidate the effects of human keratinocyte-derived HaCaT cells (HIV-TAT) protein transduction domains (PTD) coupled heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) fusion protein (TAT-HO-1) on radiationinduced human keratinocyte-derived HaCaT cells. Methods: This study was conducted between May 2010 and February 2013 in the School of Radiation Medicine and Protection, Soochow University, Suzhou, China. This experimental study was designed to explore the protective role of TAT-HO-1 in skin cells. The human HO-1 gene was fused with a gene fragment encoding TAT PTD to produce in-frame TAT-HO-1. The distribution of TAT-HO-1 was measured by immunostaining and Western blot. The radioprotection for TAT-HO-1 was determined using clonogenic assay. Alterations in apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: The expressed and purified TAT-HO-1 recombinant protein could be incorporated into human HaCaT cells. We then evaluated the protective role of TAT-HO-1 against ionizing radiation. The TAT-HO-1 attenuated the generation of reactive oxygen species and decreased HaCaT cell radiosensitivity to irradiation. Moreover, HaCaT cells pretreated with TAT-HO-1 resulted in less apoptosis by radiation. In addition, TATHO- 1 could penetrate rat skin. Conclusion: These results suggest that TAT-HO-1 can protect HaCaT cells from ionizing radiation.

METHODS: HeLa cell growth inhibitory effect was detected by CCK-8; colony formation assay was used to detect the radiosensitivity changes; We used the flow cytometry to detect the rate of apoptosis; Mitochondrial fluorescent probe imaging was used to detect the changes in mitochondrial activity; Determination of protein expression in cells were detected by Western Blot method. RESULTS: The results showed that MLN2238 significantly inhibited HeLa cells, with the inhibition rate of 3.95% by 0.05 μmol/L, 14.89% by 0.1 μmol/L, 29.37% by 0.5 μmol/L, 38.95% by 1 μmol/L, 54.44% by 5 μmol/L, 70.52% by 10 μmol/L, 81.76% by 30 μmol/L, and its effect was dose-dependent, F=1172.02, P<0.001; MLN2238(0.1 μmol/L) showed the radiosensitizing effects on HeLa cells, and the sensitizing enhancement ratio (SER) was 1.40. MLN2238 interacts with X-ray in HeLa cells. The apoptosis rate of the control group was (2.64±0.07)%, the MLN2238 group was (2.76±0.38)%, the 4 Gy radiation single group was (9.50±0.14)%, the 8 Gy radiation single group was (21.04±0.04)%, the 4 Gy combination group was (11.12±0.19)%, the 8 Gy combination group was (26.18±0.35)%, the apoptosis rate was increased, the difference was statistically significant (F=20.23, P=0.0022). 0.1 μmol/L MLN2238 aggravated the menbrane injury while it can increase apoptosis, the combination of X-rays and MLN2238 can increase the expression of protein Bcl-2 and Bax. CONCLUSION: MLN2238 can inhibite HeLa cells growth and has radiosensitizing effect on HeLa cells, which may be mediated through the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.

43049093730	Loss of XIAP sensitizes rosiglitazone-induced growth inhibition of colon cancer in vivo	Ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) possess anticancer properties. However, the efficacy of PPARγ ligands varies in different cancers. In colon cancer, the role of PPARγ and its ligands is controversial. We recently showed that downregulation of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) could sensitize colon cancer cells to troglitazone, and 15-deoxy-D12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15-PGJ2) induced cell killing. In our study, we aimed to examine whether rosiglitazone, another more clinically relevant PPARγ ligand, has any synergistic anticancer effect with XIAP downregulation in colon cancer.

42349113243	Interactions between XIAP associated factor 1 and a nuclear co-activator, CBP, in colon cancer cells	Background/Aims: XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a nuclear protein. CBP, the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein, plays an important role as a multifunctional transcriptional co-activator. In this investigation, we aimed to study the putative interaction between XAF1 and CBP in colon cancer cells. Methods: Expressions of XAF1 and CBP were detected by Western blot and RT-PCR. The interaction between XAF1 and CBP was investigated by the glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay, colocalization and co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Cell proliferation was examined by cell number counting. Results: Both XAF1 and CBP were co-localized in the nuclei of colon cancer cells and they demonstrated a physical interaction, as revealed by GST pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation analysis. CBP I peptide (residues 1-1098) was the interacting domain for XAF1 binding. The functional implication of the interaction between XAF1 and CBP was demonstrated by the finding that cell growth inhibition by XAF1 was potentiated by cotransfection with CBP. Furthermore, a reporter assay demonstrated that cotransfection with XAF1 and CBP led to marked reduction in phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated adaptor-related protein complex 1 activity. Conclusions: CBP is a novel binding partner of XAF1, and the interaction between XAF1 and CBP and their functional consequence were mediated by adaptor-related protein complex 1. Copyright © 2008 S.

43449137594	Effects of ACEI on retinal VEGF expression in diabetic rat	Objective: An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) reduce the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, the mechanisms underling the effect of ACEI on DR remain largely unidentified. This study was to determine the effects of ACEI on retinal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in diabetic rat. Methods: The streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected to establish the diabetic model in 24 male SD rats as experimental group, and compound citric acid solution was injected in 24 male SD rats as control. The rats from experimental group and control group were divided into ACEI fosenopril sodium-treated group, β-adrenergic blocker propranolol-treated group, or vehicle for 24 weeks group. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, Western blot and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to assess the expression of VEGF protein and mRNA. Results: Vitreous fluid and retinal VEGF protein and retinal VEGF mRNA expression were higher in diabetic rats than in control groups and showed a significant reduction in fosenopril sodium-treated diabetic rats (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between diabetic rats and propranolol-treated diabetic rats (P > 0.05), but there was a significant difference between propranolol-treated diabetic rats and fosenopril sodium-treated diabetic rats in the expression of VEGF protein and mRNA (P < 0.01) without any significant difference in systolic blood pressure in the latter two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The effects of ACEI on retinal VEGF expression is independent of its anti-hypertensive action. ACEI could offer particular benefits beyond blood pressure reduction in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy with or without hypertension.

4444309425	Antitumor effect of a novel adeno-associated virus vector targeting to telomerase activity in tumor cells	Telomerase activity is a wide tumor marker. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic subunit of the telomerase, is transcriptionally upregulated exclusively in about 90% of cancer cells. In this study, we constructed a novel adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector containing the human interferon-β (hIFN-β) gene under the control of hTERT promoter (AAV-hTERT-hIFN-β) and investigated its antitumor effect against various human cancer cells in vitro. AAV-hTERT-hIFN-β displayed cancer-specific hIFN-β expression and cytotoxicity. The cytotoxic ratio was positively correlated with the time length of infection. AAV-hTERT-hIFN-β-mediated apoptotic morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Flow cytometry assay also revealed that the cytotoxicity of AAV-hTERT-hIFN-β was mainly an apoptotic process. These data indicate that AAV in combination with hTERT-mediated therapeutic gene expression may open new possibilities for long-lasting and targeting gene therapy of varieties of cancers.

4644309194	Effect of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors on Helicobacter pylori susceptibility to metronidazole and clarithromycin	Background: We previously reported that aspirin inhibited Helicobacter pylori growth and suppressed the mutagenic effect of metronidazole. Aim: To determine the effects of a cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitor, SC-236, and a non-selective COX inhibitor, indometacin, on the growth, urease activity and antimicrobial susceptibility of H. pylori. Methods: Three H. pylori reference strains, and 18 clinical isolates were treated with SC-236 or indometacin for 24 and 48 h. Growth, urease activity and susceptibility to clarithromycin and metronidazole of the bacteria were assessed by viable colony counting, spectrophotometry and E-test respectively. Results: SC-236 and indometacin inhibited H. pylori growth in a dose-dependent manner with the lowest inhibitory concentrations of 0.03 and 0.1 mM, and the lethal concentrations of 0.09 and 0.3 mM, respectively. The numbers of CFU/mL in Brucella broth containing 0.09 mM SC-236 were 2 log lower at 24 h, and even 3 log lower at 48 h than that at 0 h (P = 0.035, compared with the vehicle control). Treatment of 0.3 mM indometacin reduced the number of CFU/mL by 1 log at 24 h compared with that at 0 h (P = 0.037 compared with the vehicle control). Helicobacter pylori urease activity began to decrease with 0.06 mM SC-236 at 24 h (P = 0.016), and 0.3 mM indometacin at 48 h (P = 0.025). MICs of metronidazole and clarithromycin against H. pylori were decreased significantly in the presence of 0.03 mM SC-236 or 0.1 mM indometacin (all P < 0.001). Conclusion: Both SC-236 and indometacin suppressed the growth and urease activity of H. pylori in a dose-dependent manner, and increased its susceptibility to the antibiotics.

47949129803	XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) suppresses angiogenesis in mouse endothelial cells	Objectives: XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor gene, but its role in angiogenesis is unknown. We investigated whether XAF1 has any antiangiogenesis effect. Methods: MS1 (a mouse endothelial cell line) was infected with an adenoviral vector ZD55-XAF1. Controls were uninfected or infected with ZD55-EGFP. Wound healing assay and tube formation assay were used to assess angiogenesis. Cell proliferation was detected by WST-1 assay, and apoptosis was detected by TUNEL and APOPercentage™ assays. Results: ZD55-XAF1 significantly upregulated XAF1, which was associated with decreased cell proliferation, migration and tube formation of MS1 cells. Ectopic overexpression of XAF1 induced apoptosis in MS1 and also sensitized cells to 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis. A significant decrease in the expression of Tie-1, Ang-1, Ang-2 and c-Myc was observed. Conclusions: Our data suggest that XAF1 possesses a potential antiangiogenesis effect. Suppressed expression of Tie-1, Ang-1, Ang-2 and c-Myc may be mechanistically responsible for the observed antiangiogenesis effect. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.

49349084817	Pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX1) functions as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer	Aim: Pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX1) is a transcription factor of homeobox genes family important in differentiation and development of the pancreas, duodenum and antrum. This study aims to clarify the putative role of PDX1 in gastric carcinogenesis. Methods: PDX1 expression was detected in gastric tissues with chronic gastritis and cancer as well as gastric cancer cell lines by immunohistochemistry, western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays. The effects of PDX1 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, clone formation and migration were evaluated using cancer cell lines after transient or stable transfection with PDX1-expressing vector. The ability of PDX1 stable transfectant in tumor formation in xenograft mice was assessed. Results: PDX1 was strongly expressed in normal gastric glands, but was absent in 29 of 39 of human gastric cancer and most gastric cancer cell lines. Negative correlation between PDX1 and Ki-67 expression was found in both gastric tissues and cell lines. Ectopic overexpression of PDX1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, accompanied by the activation of caspases 3, 8, 9 and 10. Overexpression of PDX1 also impaired the ability of cancer cells in clonal formation and migration in vitro. Furthermore, stable transfection with PDX1 reduced the ability of cancer cells in tumor formation in nude mice. Conclusions: PDX1 expression is lost in gastric cancers. Its effect on cell proliferation/apoptosis, migration and tumor formation in vitro and in vivo suggested that this protein functions as a putative tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. © The Author 2008.

50249140568	Expression of aquaporin 1 in retinal neovascularization: Experiment with mice	Objective: To investigate the expression of aquaporin (AQP) 1 in retina during neovascularization. Methods: Sixty C57BL/6J 7-day-old mice were randomly divided into 2 equal groups. The 30 mice of the model group were raised in 75% ± 2% oxygen for 5 days and then returned to condition with normal oxygen (room air) for 3 - 5 days. 12, 15, and 17 days after birth (on the postnatal day 12, 15, and 17) 10 mice from each group were killed respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used on 6 eyes and RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression of AQP1 in 7 eyes respectively. Thirty mice were raised in normal oxygen as controls. Results: The retinal neovascularization rate on P17 in the model group was 100%. AQP1 expression in retina was seen in 1 eye from the model and control groups each on P12, and in all mice of both groups on P15 and P17, especially in the lateral retina. AQP1 expression in retinal endothelial cells was seen in the model mice and not in the control mice. There were not significant differences in the AQP1 mRNA expression level on P12 and P15 between the 2 groups, however, the AQP1 mRNA expression level on P17 was significantly higher in the model group than in the control group (1.81 ± 1.02 vs 1.15 ± 0.01, P = 0.000). AQP1 protein expression was seen on P12, P15, and P17 in both groups, and the AQP1 protein expression level at P17 of the model group was significantly higher than that of the control group (1.82 ± 0.05 vs 1.57 ± 0.04,P = 0.000). Conclusion: AQP1 protein may play an important role in retinal neovascularization.

53349101676	Early upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 in human papillomavirus type 16 and telomerase-induced immortalization of human esophageal epithelial cells	Background and Aim: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, it is not clear whether COX-2 is involved in the early or late stage of the development of ESCC. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of COX-2 in the carcinogenesis of ESCC by an immortalized esophageal epithelial cell line. Methods: Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16)-E6/E7 and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) transfection were used for immortalization of esophageal epithelial cells. COX-2-specific RNA interference was used for the inhibition of COX-2 expression. Results: An immortalized esophageal epithelial cell line, NE6-E6E7/hTERT, was established, which had high proliferation activity but failed to induce colony formation in soft agar. COX-2 expression was upregulated in the early process of immortalization, while COX-2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) decreased the Bcl-2 expression, increased the expression of Bax, and induced cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in NE6-E6E7/hTERT cells. Expressions of p53, cyclinD1, and the ratio of hyperphosphorylated-RB/ hypophosphorylated-RB were progressively increased after E6E7 and the subsequent hTERT transfections. These changes were accompanied by the alteration of COX-2 expression, but could be reversed by COX-2 siRNA (P < 0.05). P16 expression was significantly downregulated in NE6-E6E7 or NE6-E6E7/hTERT cells (P < 0.05), and was not affected by COX-2 siRNA. Conclusions: Our results suggest that induction of cyclooxygenase-2 is essential in the human papillomavirus type 16 and hTERT-induced immortalization of human esophageal epithelial cells, and that COX-2 inhibition may be a potential target to block the carcinogenesis of ESCC at the precancerous stage. © 2008 The Authors.

53549116457	Investigation of proliferation and apoptosis of retinal vascular endothelial cells and pericytes under acidic extracellular pH	Objective: Retinal acidosis follows hyperglycemia and hypoxia. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of acidosis in the cellular mechanism of retinal neovascularization. Methods: Primary bovine retinal endothelial cells (BRECs) and bovine retinal pericytes (BRPs) were obtained from bovine and were cultured in DMEM + 20% fetal bovine serum. The passaged retinal endothelial cells and pericytes were exposed to various culture condition with pH 7.2, pH 6.8 or pH 6.5. Proliferation rate in normal and acidified cells was determined by MTS, and apoptosis and cycles assay staining were analyzed by Annexin V/FITC and PI staining using flow cytometry. Results: Cultured BRECs were identified by anti-VIII factor relavent antigen antibody, showing the brown staining. Cultured bovine retinal pericytes showed α-SMA positive staining. There was statistically significant difference in cultured cell number (F = 432.910, P = 0.000), cell number of S phase (F = 29.000, P = 0.001) and cellular apoptosis rate (F = 7.14, P = 0.024) of BRECs among the pH 7.2 group, pH 6.8 group and pH 6.5 group. The growth status of cultured BRPs showed the same pattern (F = 147.640, P = 0.000; F = 26.680, P = 0.001; F = 11.680, P = 0.009, respectively), indicating acidosis significantly inhibited the proliferation and DNA synthesis of BRECs and BRPs (P < 0.01), and severe acidosis inhibited the apoptosis of BRECs (P < 0.05) but induced the apoptosis of BRPs (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The fact that acidosis inhibits the apoptosis of endothelial cells and induces the apoptosis of pericytes reveals that acidosis may participate in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.

54249162933	Factors affecting physicians' practices related to Helicobacter pylori infection: Effect of experience and mode of practice	Background: Studies found that guidelines on the management of Helicobacter pylori were not always followed in clinical practice. This study investigated factors that were responsible for the deviation. Methods: A cross-sectional survey using a structured self-administered questionnaire was used to ask physicians whether they would offer testing and treatment for H. pylori infection in different clinical scenarios. Results: 170 medical practitioners completed the questionnaires. Respondents in the private sector were significantly more likely to test and treat than those in the public sector for patients with a history of peptic ulcer, gastric cancer or no symptom (p = 0.018, <0.001 and 0.041, respectively). Significant differences in practice were noted amongst practitioners of different specialty and seniority, but not qualification. Medical practitioners in the private sector complied with the guidelines significantly better than those in the public sector (p = 0.002) and so did senior practitioners compared with junior practitioners (p < 0.001). The specialty and qualification of the respondents, however, did not have a significant effect. Conclusion: There were significant differences in the management of H. pylori amongst medical practitioners from the private and public sectors and amongst senior and junior practitioners. Published guidelines were not completely followed. Further educational campaigns are needed. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.

57649112684	Effect of insulin on VEGF expression in bovine retinal microvascular endothelial cells exposed to normal or high glucose	Objective: To investigate the effect of insulin or (and) high glucose on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in bovine retinal microvascular endothelial cells (BREC). Methods: It was a experimental study. BREC were cultured with selective culture media. Passaged cells were cultured in normal (5 mmol/L) or high glucose (30 mmol/L) medium for 3 days. Equimolar mannitol was supplemented for osmotic controls. Cells were serum-deprived overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% w/v bovine serum albumin and then incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nmol/L insulin for 24 hrs. Cells were harvested and the expression of VEGF mRNA was analyzed by Real-time PCR. VEGF protein level was determined by HUVEC proliferation assay, immunofluorescence and western-blot. Results: Insulin or (and) high glucose significantly increased VEGF mRNA (F = 5.67,9.04; P < 0.05) and protein (F = 5.50,5.57; P < 0.05) expression. However, the combined effect of insulin and high glucose is weak in contrast to insulin or high glucose alone. Conclusions: High glucose attenuated insulin-induced VEGF expression. Therefore, VEGF may be not the major factor that lead to transient worsening of diabetic retinopathy after acute insulin therapy in diabetes.

60949088870	Quality of life in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux	Background: Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) disease is an extraesophageal manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The impact of GERD-related LPR on the psychological well-being and quality of life (QOL) in Chinese is not known. Aim: To assess the QOL in patients with LPR disease. Methods: 76 LPR and 73 healthy subjects were recruited. Psychological well-being was assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score and QOL was assessed by SF-36. Results: 51/76 (67.1%) patients had GERD-related LPR. More LPR subjects had taken sick leave (36.2 vs. 5.6%, p = 0.001) and reported adverse social life impact (60.5 vs. 38.9%, p = 0.013). LPR patients showed significantly worse results on the Voice Handicap Index (47.8 vs. 7.6, p = 0.001), were more anxious and had worse QOL in social functioning, pain and general health perception domains of SF-36. GERD-related LPR subjects had a higher depression score (4.8 vs. 3.8, p = 0.014) and a lower mental summary score (41.8 vs. 48.4, p = 0.01) in SF-36 compared with those without GERD. Conclusions: LPR had a negative impact on psychological status, social functioning and QOL. GERD symptoms appeared to be the main contributor to decrease QOL. GERD-related LPR patients had a significant impact on the mental component of their QOL. © 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.

60149110314	c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1) upregulates XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) through interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) in gastrointestinal cancer	Background and Aims: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that can sensitize cancer cell to apoptosis. Intrinsic expression of XAF1 in cancer cell is low. Our purpose is to determine the effect of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) on XAF1 expression and the putative mechanism. Methods: XAF1 expression in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer cell line AGS and SW1116 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR and immunoblotting. The role of JNK1 was assessed by ectopic overexpression with wild-type (JNK1-WT) and dominant-negative (JNK1-DN) JNK1 constructs. The effects of JNK1 activator, interferon (IFN)-α, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), or JNK1 inhibitor, SP600125, were evaluated. An XAF1 promoter reporter pLUC107 with WT or mutated interferon regulatory factor 1-binding element (IRF-E) was used to assess JNK1-induced transcription by dual luciferase assay. Result: Ectopic overexpression of JNK1-WT or treatment with IFN-α, TNF-α and PMA induced whereas SP600125 suppressed intrinsic and induced XAF1 expression. Induction of XAF1 required de novo protein synthesis. Moreover, JNK1 stimulated whereas SP600125 suppressed XAF1 promoter activity. JNK1 stimulated interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1 expression, whereas both IRF-1 small-interfering RNA and site mutation of IRF-E within XAF1 promoter abrogated the effect of JNK1. Conclusion: JNK1 stimulated and mediated the effects of IFN and TNF-α on XAF1 expression through transcriptional regulation by induction of IRF-1. The linkage of JNK1, IRF-1 and XAF1 in the same signal pathway may unravel a novel mechanism in regulation of apoptosis and differentiation of GI cancers. © The Author 2008.

64049114354	Alterations of gastric homeoprotein expression in helicobacter pylori infection, incisural antralisation, and intestinal metaplasia	Purpose This study was to determine whether gastric expression of homeoproteins is altered in Helicobacter pylori infection, incisural antralisation, and intestinal metaplasia (IM). Methods Gastric biopsy specimens were taken from 98 patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia for the detection of H. pylori infection; histological examinations; immunohistochemical staining of CDX2, PDX1, PAX6, and NKX6.1. Results Of the patients, 38 were positive for H. pylori infection, 44 had antral-type mucosa at the incisura, and 22 had IM in the stomach. At the incisura, the expression of PDX1, NKX6.1, and PAX6 in cytoplasm compartment was down-regulated in antral-type mucosa compared with that in the transitional- or body-type mucosa (all P < 0.01). The expression of PDX1, PAX6, and NKX6.1 in cytoplasm at the incisura was down-regulated in H. pylori-infected patients compared with that in those without H. pylori infection (all P < 0.01). CDX2 expression in whole stomach was up-regulated, but PDX1 expression at the incisura was down-regulated in patients with IM compared with that in those without IM (all P < 0.01). Conclusions Gastric expression of PDX1, PAX 6, and NKX6.1 is down-regulated in H. pylori infection and incisural antralisation. CDX2 is up-regulated but PDX1 is down-regulated in the presence of IM. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

64649091717	Protective effect of perindopril on diabetic retinopathy is associated with decreased vascular endothelial growth factor-to-pigment epithelium-derived factor ratio: Involvement of a mitochondria-reactive oxygen species pathway	OBJECTIVE-This study aimed to verify whether the decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-to-pig- ment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) ratio can serve as an indicator for the protective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) on diabetic retinopathy (DR) and to investigate the role of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the downregulated VEGF-to-PEDF ratio. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Diabetic rats and control animals were randomly assigned to receive perindopril or vehicle for 24 weeks, and bovine retinal capillary endothelial cells (BRECs) were incubated with normal or high glucose with or without perindopril. VEGF, PEDF, PPARγ, and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) in the rat retinas or BREC extracts were examined by Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR. The levels of VEGF and PEDF in cell culture media were examined by ELISA. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and ROS production were assayed using JC-1 or CM-H2DCFDA. RESULTS-The VEGF-to-PEDF ratio was increased in the retina of diabetic rats; perindopril lowered the increased VEGF-to- PEDF ratio in diabetic rats and ameliorated the retinal damage. In BRECs, perindopril lowered the hyperglycemia-induced elevation of VEGF-to-PEDF ratio by reducing mitochondrial ROS. We found the decreased ROS production was a result of perindopril- induced upregulation of PPARγ and UCP-2 expression and the subsequent decrease of Δψm. CONCLUSIONS-It is concluded that the protective effect of ACEI on DR is associated with a decreased VEGF-to-PEDF ratio, which involves the mitochondria-ROS pathway through PPARγ-mediated changes of UCP-2. This study paves a way for future application of ACEI in treatment of DR. © 2009 by the American Diabetes Association.

65849305886	Edaravone (MCI-186), a free radical scavenger, attenuates retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats	To investigate the effect of edaravone (MCI-186), a free radical scavenger, against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in the rat retina.Methods:Retinal ischemia was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by elevating intraocular pressure to 110 mmHg for 60 min. The rats were intraperitoneally injected with edaravone at a dose of 3 mg/kg at 30 min before ischemia, and then treated with edaravone (3 mg/kg, ip) twice daily for 1 or 5 d after I/R. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the retinal tissues were determined on d 1 after I/R injury. The apoptosis of retinal neurons was detected on d 1 after I/R injury by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP nick-end labeling staining. The electroretinogram (ERG) was recorded on d 5 after reperfusion.Results:Edaravone lowered MDA levels, raised SOD activity, and attenuated I/R-induced apoptosis of retinal neurons within the inner nuclear, ganglion cell, and outer nuclear layers of the rat retina. Moreover, edaravone suppressed I/R-induced reduction in a- and b-wave amplitudes of ERG.Conclusion:Edaravone can protect the retina from I/R injury in rats through reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting apoptosis of retinal neurons, which suggests that edaravone might be a potential choice for the treatment of I/R-induced eye disorders. © 2008 CPS and SIMM.

66349089835	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ contributes to the inhibitory effects of embelin on colon carcinogenesis	Down-regulation of XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) sensitizes colon cancer cells to the anticancer effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) ligands in mice. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of embelin (2,5-dihydroxy-3-undecyl-1, 4-benzoquinone), an antagonist of XIAP, on colon cancer, with a particular focus on whether PPARγ is required for embelin to exert its effect. A dominant-negative PPARγ was used to antagonize endogenous PPARγ in HCT116 cells. Cells were treated with or without embelin. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity were measured. For in vivo studies, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH) was s.c. injected to induce colon cancer in PPARγ

67650085249	Restoration of XAF1 expression induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth in gastric cancer	XAF1 (XIAP-associated factor 1) is a novel XIAP binding protein that can antagonize XIAP and sensitize cells to other cell death triggers. Our previous results have shown that aberrant hypermethylation of the CpG sites in XAF1 promoter is strongly associated with lower expression of XAF1 in gastric cancers. In our study, we investigated the effect of restoration of XAF1 expression on growth of gastric cancers. We found that the restoration of XAF1 expression suppressed anchorage-dependent and -independent growth and increased sensitivity to TRAIL and druginduced apoptosis. Stable cell clones expressing XAF1 exhibited delayed tumor initiation in nude mice. Restoration of XAF1 expression mediated by adenovirus vector greatly increased apoptosis in gastric cancer cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner and sensitized cancer cells to TRAIL and drugs-induced apoptosis. Adeno-XAF1 transduction induced cell cycle G2/M arrest and upregulated the expression of p21 and downregulated the expression of cyclin B1 and cdc2. Notably, adeno-XAF1 treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth, strongly enhanced the antitumor activity of TRAIL in a gastric cancer xenograft model in vivo, and significantly prolonged the survival time of animals bearing tumor xenografts. Complete eradication of established tumors was achieved on combined treatment with adeno-XAF1 and TRAIL. Our results document that the restoration of XAF1 inhibits gastric tumorigenesis and tumor growth and that XAF1 is a promising candidate for cancer gene therapy. © 2009 UICC.

67651043684	Retinal pigment epithelial cells secrete neurotrophic factors and synthesize dopamine: Possible contribution to therapeutic effects of RPE cell transplantation in Parkinson's disease	Background: New strategies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) are shifted from dopamine (DA) replacement to regeneration or restoration of the nigro-striatal system. A cell therapy using human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells as substitution for degenerated dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons has been developed and showed promising prospect in clinical treatment of PD, but the exact mechanism underlying this therapy is not fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated whether the beneficial effects of this therapy are related to the trophic properties of RPE cells and their ability to synthesize DA. Methods: We evaluated the protective effects of conditioned medium (CM) from cultured RPE cells on the DAergic cells against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)- and rotenone-induced neurotoxicity and determined the levels of glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) released by RPE cells. We also measured the DA synthesis and release. Finally we transplanted microcarriers-RPE cells into 6-OHDA lesioned rats and observed the improvement in apomorphine-induced rotations (AIR). Results: We report here: (1) CM from RPE cells can secret trophic factors GDNF and BDNF, and protect DAergic neurons against the 6-OHDA- and rotenone-induced cell injury; (2) cultured RPE cells express L-dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and synthesize DA; (3) RPE cells attached to microcarriers can survive in the host striatum and improve the AIR in 6-OHDA-lesioned animal model of PD; (4) GDNF and BDNF levels are found significantly higher in the RPE cell-grafted tissues. Conclusion: These findings indicate the RPE cells have the ability to secret GDNF and BDNF, and synthesize DA, which probably contribute to the therapeutic effects of RPE cell transplantation in PD. © 2009 Ming et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

67749088536	Oncogene functions of FHL2 are independent from NF-κBIα in gastrointestinal cancer	Four and a half of LIM-only protein 2 (FHL2) is an adaptor protein that can interact with many transcription factors and thus plays a variety of biological functions. Previous studies by our group have demonstrated that suppression of FHL2 was capable of inducing tumor cell differentiation, and inhibiting the growth of experimental gastric and colon cancers. Therefore, FHL2 appears to function as an oncogene. In order to further explore the mechanisms of how FHL2 is involved in tumorigenesis, we attempted to test whether FHL2 has any direct association with nuclear factor (NF-κB), the most important transcription factor involved in apoptosis, inflammation, and carcinogenesis. Using an Yeast Two Hybrid (Y2H) screening system, we have shown that FHL2 may have an interaction with NF-κBIα, the coding gene for IκBα which is the most potent endogenous inhibitor for NF-κB activation. However, subsequent studies using co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization failed to confirm the Y2H finding. Down-regulation of FHL2 by FHL2-siRNA down-regulated the expression of NF-κB p65. We therefore concluded that under the physiological condition, FHL2 may activate NF-κB pathway, even though such an activation may not be mediated by a direct binding of FHL2 to NF-κB inhibitor protein IκB. © 2008 Arányi Lajos Foundation.

68249162117	Oriental surgical protocol in orbital hypertelorism	OBJECTIVE: To summarize and analyze the diagnosis, treatment protocol, and therapeutic effect of orbital hypertelorism in the past 30 years in our center. METHODS: This retrospective study reviews the records of 128 patients from 1978 to 2008. Both radiologic measurements, such as the interorbital distance and the outer orbital distance, and anthropometric measurements, such as the width of the inner canthi (W-IC), the width of the palpebral fissure, the width of the face, and the nasofrontal angle, were conducted before and after the operation to evaluate both osseous and soft tissue alteration. An analysis of the etiology, surgical method, and complication has been undertaken. RESULTS: The main cause of orbital hypertelorism in our center was craniofacial cleft. Significant improvement in cranio-orbital appearance was noted, and 91.4% of the patients were satisfied with the surgical correction. Follow-up examinations showed a statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative measurements: interorbital distance; outer orbital distance; facial ratios W-IC/width of the palpebral fissure and W-IC/width of the face (P < 0.01); and nasofrontal angle (P < 0.05). Temporary complications and side effects remained low, with cerebrospinal fluid leakage occurred as the major complication (6.3%). CONCLUSION: There are several important protocols regarding the management of orbital hypertelorism that will provide patients with great benefit in achieving more aesthetic facial appearance. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

69949158588	Experimental study of compound xueshuantong in inhibiting angiogenesis	• AIM: To investigate the effect of compound xueshuantong on angiogenesis. • METHODS: Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) method was used to assess the effect of compound xueshuantong on angiogenesis. MTS method was used to access the effect of compound xueshuantong at different concentrations on the proliferation of ECV-304 cells induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Transwell insert was used to assess the effect of compound xueshuantong at different concentrations on the migration of ECV-304 cells. Matrigel was used to assess the effect of compound xueshuantong at different concentrations on the tube formation of ECV-304 cells. • RESULTS; Compound xueshuantong at median and low concentrations could inhibit the angiogenesis of chick embryo CAM. The proliferation of ECV-304 cells induced by VEGF was inhibited by compound xueshuantong at concentrations from 1. 5625 to 100g/L, while it wasn't inhibited by compound xueshuantong at higher or lower concentrations. When the concentration of compound xueshuantong was 0, 3. 125, 6.25, and 12.5 g/L, cells number that migrated to under the Transwell membrane was 219 ± 17, 183 ± 14, 135 ± 13, and 19 ± 9 respectively. When the concentration of compound xueshuantong was 0, 0.390625, 0.78125, and 1.5625 g/L, tubes number formationed in Matrigel was 26.3 ± 1.2, 18.7 ± 1.5, 14.7 ± 0.6, and 2.7 ± 0.6, respectively. • CONCLUSION: Compound xueshuantong seems to play a notable role in inhibiting angiogenesis.

70349268321	Gold (III) porphyrin complexes induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and inhibit tumor growth in colon cancer	BACKGROUND: Gold (III) compounds have exhibited favorable antitumor properties both in vitro and in vivo. In a previous study, the authors reported that the novel gold (III) complex 1a (gold 1a) exhibited strong cytotoxicity in some tumor cell lines. In the current study, the effect of gold 1a was investigated on colon cancer cells. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of gold 1a was determined by using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thihazyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide method. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis and cell cycle. The expression of protein was evaluated by Western blot assay. Tumor growth in vivo was evaluated in nude mice. RESULTS: Gold 1a exhibited marked cytotoxic effects in vitro to human colon cancer, and the concentration of drug required to inhibit cell growth by 50% compared with control (IC50) values ranged from 0.2 lM to 3.4 lM, which represented 8.7-fold to 20.8-fold greater potency than that of cisplatin. Gold 1a significantly induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and cleaved caspase 3, caspase 7, and poly( ADP-ribose) polymerase; released cytochrome C, and up-regulated p53, p21, p27, and Bax. In vivo, intraperitoneal injection of gold 1a at doses of 1.5 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and suppressed colon cancer tumor growth. An acute toxicology study indicated that gold 1a at effective antitumor concentrations did not cause any toxic side effects in mice. CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggested that gold 1a may be a new potential therapeutic drug for colon cancer. © 2009 American Cancer Society.

70349908418	Comparative analysis of gene transfer to human and rat retinal pigment epithelium cell line by a combinatorial use of recombinant adeno - Associated virus and ultrasound OR/AND microbubbles	Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction has been utilized to deliver a drug/gene into cells in both in vitro and in vivo studies. This work was performed to investigate the feasibility of gene transfer to human retinal pigment epithelium cell line(ARPE-i9) and rat retinal pigment epithelium cell line(RPE-J) by a combinatorial use of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) and ultrasound (US) or/and mi-crobubbles (MBs) and compare the difference between them. Different doses of serotype 2 rAAV encoding a enhanced green fluorescent protein (1AAV2-EGFP) gene and MBs was administered to ARPE-19 and RPE-J cells under different US conditions. Transfection efficiency and cell viability were assessed by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry (FCM) analysis, trypan blue staining. The results indicated thatUS and MBs could respectively improve rAAWmediated gene transfer to RPE-J cells, but neither US nor MBs could do so in ARPE-L9 cells. US plus MBs could significantly enhance rAAWmediated gene transfer to ARPE-L9 cells, however, the same effects were not seen in RPE-J cells. These findings demonstrated it is not always coincident that US, MBs and US plus MBs exert the similar effects on gene transfer in vitro RPE cells. So, it is necessary to choose appropriate RPE cell line for the study of US or/and MBs-mediated rAAV gene transfer in retinal gene therapy.

Background: Recent studies have suggested the eradication rate for Helicobacter pylori infection with standard amoxycillin-clarithromycin- containing triple therapy as first-line treatment have fallen below 80%. Levofloxacin-containing triple therapy was proposed as an alternative. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the standard 7-day clarithromycin-containing triple therapy against the 7-day levofloxacin- containing triple therapy, and to assess whether the classical triple therapy is still valid as empirical first-line treatment for H. pylori infection in Hong Kong. Methods: Three hundred consecutive H. pylori-positive patients were randomized to receive either 1 week of EAL (esomeprazole 20 mg b.d., amoxycillin 1 g b.d., and levofloxacin 500 mg daily) or EAC (esomeprazole 20 mg b.d., amoxycillin 1 g b.d., and clarithromycin 500 mg b.d.).

70350692047	Compared study of asian reduction malarplasty: Wedge-section osteotomy versus conventional procedures	Objective: The zygomatic body and arch are usually prominent in Asians; therefore, malar reduction is one of the most popular procedures for aesthetic facial contouring. The purpose of this study was to establish a new option for reduction malarplasty and analyze the merits and demerits of conventional operative techniques, thus searched for more effective and reliable surgical procedures. Methods: Records of 570 patients who underwent reduction malarplasty in our center from 1988 to 2008 were reviewed in this study. Several introduced malar reduction techniques were used until an alternative wedge-section osteotomy technique was performed by the senior author (X.M.) in 2002. This new technique consisted wedge-section osteotomy of the lower zygomatic body via intraoral approach and greenstick infracture of the posterior zygomatic arch through a tiny sideburn stab incision. In this way, the prominent malar complex could be reduced by being pressed inward and stabilized by only surgical suture in moderation. The surgical indications, major complications, and patient satisfaction of different techniques were compared. Results: In our experience, intraoral incision was better than coronal incision because of less iatrogenic scar formation and postoperative complications. Our wedge-section osteotomy was more effective and reliable as compared with other conventional methods. Conclusion: Recently, intraoral and minor preauricular incision for malar reduction was more likely acceptable by surgeon as a typical procedure. Our new method was proven to be a safe, effective, and easily handled technique for malar complex reduction and thus was an optimal strategy for aesthetic facial shaping in Asians. © 2009 by Mutaz B.

70350719223	PRMT-1 and DDAHs-induced ADMA upregulation is involved in ROS- and RAS-mediated diabetic retinopathy	Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, is generated in presence of type 1 protein arginine N-methyltransferase (PRMT-1) and is metabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases (DDAHs). Reportedly ADMA is associated with endothelial dysfunction. The aim of this study is to investigate whether PRMT-1- and DDAHs-induced ADMA increase in diabetic rat retina and high glucose-treated bovine retinal capillary endothelial cells (BRCECs) is involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS)- and renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-mediated diabetic retinopathy. Rats were divided into four groups: sham-injected group, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic model group, STZ-induced diabetic model plus 12-week ACEI benazepril treatment group, and STZ-induced diabetic model plus 12-week ARB telmisartan treatment group. BRCECs were exposed to 5 mM glucose, 30 mM glucose, and 30 mM glucose plus benazepril, telmisartan, diphenyliodonium (NADPH oxidase inhibitor, DPI), or N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (antioxidant and free radical scavenger, NAC) until passage four. We found that the concentrations of ADMA were significantly elevated in the plasma of diabetic rat models, and were significantly reduced by benazepril or telmisartan. DDAHs expression was decreased and PRMT-1 expression was increased in diabetic rat retina, which was reversed by benazepril. Telmisartan decreased PRMT-1 expression and increased DDAH II expression, but had no effect on DDAH I expression. In vitro, BRCECs exposed to high glucose had elevated ROS production, decreased cGMP, increased PRMT-1 expression, and decreased DDAH activity and DDAH II expression. Coincubating BRCECs with benazepril, telmisartan, DPI or NAC reversed the effects of high glucose. It can be concluded that PRMT-I and DDAHs-induced upregulation of ADMA levels might be involved in ROS- and RAS-mediated diabetic retinopathy. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

70450209149	Regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and pigment epithelium-derived factor in rat retinal explants under retinal acidification	Purpose: To explore whether retinal acidification independently regulates the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and whether the regulation is related to oxidative stress.Methods: After culture of rat retinas in the medium with normal pH (7.2) or acidic pH (6.8 or 6.5), or followed by pH reversion back to the normal, or meanwhile with the presence of antioxidants, VEGF and PEDF mRNA and protein were determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription- ploymerase chain reaction and western blot.Results: Retinal acidification significantly increased the expression of VEGF and PEDF mRNA and protein. pH reversion recovered VEGF and PEDF mRNA and reduced VEGF and PEDF protein induced by acidification. Acidification-increased VEGF was completely inhibited in the retinas of pH 6.8, and largely reduced in the retinas of pH 6.5 by antioxidants. Antioxidants further increased PEDF mRNA and protein induced by retinal acidification.Conclusions: VEGF can be induced by retinal acidification alone, which may be regulated through oxidative stress, among other factors. The fact that increased PEDF under retinal acidification is promoted by antioxidants suggests that oxidative stress inhibits the production of PEDF. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

70450257720	Induction of MIF expression by oxidized LDL via activation of NF-κB in vascular smooth muscle cells	Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine playing important roles in atherosclerosis. MIF gene deficiency and neutralizing antibodies against MIF have been reported to exert anti-atherosclerotic effects in various animal models. However, the mechanism by which MIF is induced in atherosclerotic lesions remains unclear. In the present studies, we cloned a 540 bp full-length rabbit MIF cDNA by screening a rabbit uterine library. The cDNA contains a 348 bp open-reading frame which encodes a deduced 115-amino acid polypeptide with ∼90% similarity to human and mouse homologs. Constitutive MIF mRNA expression was detected in most rabbit tissues including aortas. The expression of MIF obviously abounded in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of the atherosclerotic plaques. In cultured VSMCs, MIF expression was significantly induced by a pro-atherogenic factor, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). Promoter analysis showed there were two NF-κB binding sites in the MIF proximal promoter region. Deletion or mutation of the two sites abolished oxLDL-enhanced MIF promoter activity. Moreover, the induction of MIF by oxLDL can be blocked by IκB-α overexpression. Taken together, our results revealed that MIF expression can be induced by oxLDL in VSMCs via a NF-κB dependent manner, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

72249100819	Serum macrophage migration-inhibitory factor as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the potential diagnostic value of migration-inhibitory factor (MIF) for gastric cancer in patients presenting with dyspepsia and its prognostic value for gastric cancer. METHODS: A cohort of 97 patients with histologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma and 222 patients with dyspepsia were recruited. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure serum MIF and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). RESULTS: The serum MIF concentrations were 6554.0 ± 204.1 pg/mL and 1453.7 ± 79.9 pg/mL, respectively, in gastric cancer patients and dyspeptic patients (P < .001). Serum MIF levels increased with the advancing gastric pathologies (P < .001). With the cutoff value of 3230 pg/mL, serum MIF had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 83.5%, 92.3%, and 89.7%, respectively, in diagnosing gastric cancer, whereas the rates were 60.8%, 83.3%, and 76.5%, respectively, for serum CEA. Gastric cancer patients with serum MIF levels above 6600 pg/mL had a lower 5-year survival rate than those with serum MIF level below that level (P = .012). Higher serum CEA levels were also associated with poor survival. The prediction for 5-year survival was even better (P = .0001), using a combination of serum MIF and CEA. CONCLUSIONS: Serum MIF level, which correlates with gastric MIF expression, is a better molecular marker than CEA in diagnosing gastric cancer in patients presenting with dyspepsia. A combination of serum MIF and CEA predicts 5-year survival better than the individual test. © 2009 American Cancer Society.

72049094838	Study of tear function and functional visual acuity after LASIK	• AIM: To investigate the change of tear function and functional visual acuity(FVA) after LASIK. • METHODS: Forty-eight consecutive patients (96 eyes) who underwent LASIK for the correction of myopia were investigated. Dry eye symptoms, tear break-up time(BUT), Schirmer test values (STV), and corneal sodium fluorescein(FL), staining were measured before surgery and 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. The difference of FVA and baseline visual acuity (baseline VA) were also compared (FVA′). • RESULTS: Before surgery, 16% of patients (15/96) had dry eye symptoms. After surgery, 95% of patients (91/96), 85% of patients (82/96), 59% of patients (57/96), 45% of patients (43/96), and 33% of patients (32/96) experienced dry eye symptoms at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. One day after operation, BUT (7.06 ± 2.04s) shortened to (4.4 ± 1.8s; t = 2.65, P = 0.00). STI (12.7 ± 6.6mm) increased to (14.5 ± 6.6mm; t = 1.76, P = 0.036). ST II(7.2 ± 2.4mm) decreased to (5.47 ± 2.02mm; t = 1.68, P = 0.00). The score of FL (1.0 ± 0.8) increased to (1.4 ± 1.0; t = 0.375, P = 0.002). All the parameters recovered at the 6th month after operation, except for STI(10.6 ± 7.0mm; t = 1.83, P = 0.03) which was still lower than that of the preoperative. FVA′ increased from 0.50 ± 0.37 to 0.62 ± 0.35 (t = 1.146, P = 0.025) 1 day postoperatively and recovered 1 week after operation. • CONCLUSION: Dry eye symptoms are common complications after myopic LASIK surgery. LASIK can significantly alter the BUT, ST I and ST II. Patients may experience a transient decrease in FVA that returns to baseline within 1 week.

73649114934	Comparative analysis of the effects of ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction on recombinant adeno-associated virus- and plasmid-mediated transgene expression in human retinal pigment epithelium cells	Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) has been utilized to deliver a drug/gene into cells in both in vitro and in vivo studies. This study was performed to investigate the feasibility of UTMD-enhanced recombinant adeno-associated virus- (rAAV) and plasmid-mediated transfection into the human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell line ARPE-19. Additionally, the transfection efficiency of rAAV and plasmid was compared in order to choose the appropriate gene vector or strategy to be used with UTMD for RPE-based gene modification. rAAV or plasmid encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein gene was administered to ARPE-19 cells under various UTMD conditions. Cell viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl- tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Transfection efficiency was determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. UTMD significantly enhanced the transfection efficiency of rAAV and plasmid in ARPE-19 cells without adverse effects on cell viability. The transfection efficiency of rAAV was higher than that of plasmid. rAAV is therefore an appropriate gene vector for use with UTMD in retinal gene modification.

77149161425	Tumor suppressor XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) cooperates with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand to suppress colon cancer growth and trigger tumor regression	BACKGROUND: XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) antagonizes the anticaspase activity of XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis) and functions as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer. The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is known as a potential anticancer agent. In this study, the synergistic effect of XAF1 and TRAIL on colon cancer growth was investigated. METHODS: Adeno-XAF1 virus was generated and purified. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow-cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Protein expression of the different genes was determined by Western blot analysis. Tumorigenesis and tumor growth were assessed in subcutaneous nude mouse xenograft experiments. RESULTS: Stable overexpression of XAF1-sensitized colon cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis significantly increased the activity of caspase 3, 7, 8, and 9; released cytochrome c; and down-regulated XIAP, survivin, and c-IAP-2. The restoration of XAF1 expression mediated by adenovirus (adeno-XAF1) directly induced apoptosis, and synergized TRAIL-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Ex vivo transduction of adeno-XAF1 suppressed colon cancer formation in vivo. Furthermore, adeno-XAF1 treatment of mice significantly inhibited tumor growth, strongly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis and antitumor activity in colon cancer xenograft models in vivo, and markedly prolonged the survival. Notably, the combined treatment with adeno-XAF1 and TRAIL completely eradicated the established tumors without detectable toxicity in normal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The combined restoration of XAF1 expression and TRAIL treatment may be a potent strategy for colon cancer therapy. © 2010 American Cancer Society.

77951742411	Trend of colorectal cancer in Hong Kong: 1983-2006	Background and Aim: The incidence of colorectal cancer (CC) is increasing in many Asian countries, but decreasing in western countries. The present study examined the local incidence of CC in the past few decades. Methods: A population based study, using data from Hong Kong (HK) Cancer Registry, was carried out to examine the trends of CC in different age groups in HK. Comparison with other countries was made. Results: The crude rate of CC in HK increased from 29.6/100 000 in 1983 to 57.1/100 000 in 2006. Age standardized rate (ASR) increased by less than 20%. It was markedly smaller than the 190% increase in crude rate. ASR progressively increased in males. In females, ASR peaked in 1994 and declined in the last decade. In most countries, the risk of CC was higher and increasing in males, but stable or decreasing in females. With respect to age, increasing risk was noted in males above 60 years old and females above 70 years old. However, a declining rate was noted in those below 50 years old. The decrease was over 40% in the 30-34 years group over the past two decades. Conclusions: Increasing incidence of CC in HK was mostly in the older and male population, but not in the younger age group. © 2010 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

77952220772	A SiRNA targeting vascular endothelial growth factor-A inhibiting experimental corneal neovascularization	Purpose: This study was designed to investigate whether synthetic small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting VEGF-A could inhibit mouse corneal neovascularization or not. Methods: First, the effect of synthetic siRNA targeting VEGF-A on the expression of VEGF in human retinal pigment epithelial line ARPE-19 cells was examined. Corneal neovascularization was induced on the right cornea of C57BL/6 mice by alkali burn. Mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (21 animals in each group): VEGF-A siRNA group, stable negative siRNA group, saline control group, and blank control group. After alkali burn, except for the blank control group, the other 3 groups were subconjunctivally injected with VEGF-A siRNA, stable negative siRNA, and normal saline, respectively. On days 3 and 7 after alkali burn, the concentration of VEGF in the cornea was determined by ELISA kit. On day 10, the neovascularized corneal area was mensurated, the amount of corneal new vessels was quantified by CD31 immunohistochemical assay of corneal sections, and permeability of new vessels was shown by fluorescence angiography. Results: After comparing the histological appearance of the cornea between the VGF-A siRNA group and the 3 control groups on days 10 and 30, it was found that in the VEGF-A siRNA group, not only was VEGF expression in the cornea induced by alkali burn but also neovascularized corneal area and amount of new vessels were reduced, followed by the permeability of new vessels, and corneal histological structure were improved. It was also found that the exposure to VEGF-A siRNA significantly reduced the VEGF-A mRNA expression in AREP-19 cells. These findings suggested synthetic siRNA targeting VEGF-A delivered by subconjunctival injection could inhibit corneal angiogenesis induced by alkali burn. Conclusion: VEGF-A siRNA could potentially serve as an important therapeutic alternative in the management against unwanted angiogenesis including corneal neovascularization. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

77953288185	Inhibition of pathologic retinal neovascularization by a small peptide derived from human apolipoprotein(a)	PURPOSE. To evaluate the effect of KV11, a novel 11-mer peptide from human apolipoprotein(a), against retinal neovascularization and to study its penetration and the possible toxicity to the retina. METHODS. Wound-healing, a modified Boyden chamber, and MTS assays were used to evaluate the effect of KV11 on the migration and proliferation of bovine retinal capillary endothelial cells (BRCECs) induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in vitro. The antiangiogenic effect of KV11 was also studied with a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. Then, FITC-labeled KV11 was injected into the vitreous of normal rabbits, the retinal penetration was determined by confocal laser-scanning microscope, and further confirmed by UPLC/MS analysis of KV11 in tissue extracts. Electrophysiological tests and histologic examinations were used to study the possible toxicity of KV11 against rabbit neuroretina after intravitreal administration. RESULTS. KV11 inhibited VEGF-induced BRCEC migration but not proliferation and reduced the pathologic neovascularization in a mouse model, without affecting normal retinal vasculature. FITC-labeled KV11 appeared in the retina within 30 minutes after injection and diffused to all layers 3 hours later. The transfer of KV11 from the vitreous to the retina was confirmed by UPLC/MS data. Electrophysiologic tests and histologic examinations revealed no evident functional or morphologic abnormalities in rabbit neuroretina after KV11 injection. CONCLUSIONS. It is concluded that the novel peptide KV11 is an effective inhibitor of retinal pathologic angiogenesis with a sufficient retinal penetration and a favorable safety profile and may provide a promising alternative for ocular antiangiogenic therapy. © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.

77956993736	Surface irregular index of the diabetics	• AIM: To investigate the variance of the irregular index of diabetics under ordinary circumstances and after sustained eye opening. • METHODS: In 13 consecutive diabetics and 13 cases of non-diabetic controls (age and sex matched), we performed the Schirmer I test (S I t), tear break-up time (BUT), fluorescein staining (FL) and symptom of dry eye questionnaires. Irregular index of corneal topography was also measured under routine circumstances and after sustained eye opening for 10 seconds, as a simulation of daily acts of gazing, which is defined as looking at an object with involuntary blink suppression. • RESULTS: More diabetics (9/13 vs the control group 6/13) complained the presence of one or more symptoms of dry eye once a weak. When compared with the control group diabetics showed significantly decreased S I t (11.4 ± 2.5 vs 14.9 ± 3.3 mm/5 min, P < 0.01) and BUT (10.9 ± 4.7 vs 13.6 ± 3.4s, P = 0.02). None of values differed between FL of two groups (0.59 ± 0.65 vs 0.29 ± 0.54, P = 0.06). The ordinary irregular index was higher in diabetics although the differences were not significant (1.36 ± 0.46, 1.11 ± 0.45, P = 0.06). However, after 10 seconds of sustained eye opening, the irregular index increased significantly to 4.23 ± 1.32 in the diabetic group, whereas it remained at 2.08 ± 0.60 in controls (P < 0.01). • CONCLUSION: In diabetics, reflex tearing and the tear film stability are demonstrated to be decreased. The SRI of diabetics increases when the eyes are kept open.

78449232122	Impact of sildenafil therapy on pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults with congenital heart disease	Background: It has been demonstrated that sildenafil is effective in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, the impact of sildenafil on PAH in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) has been less investigated. Objective: In this prospective, open-label, uncontrolled and multicenter study, 60 patients with PAH related to CHD received oral sildenafil (75 mg/day) for 12 weeks. The enrolled patients underwent six-minute walk test (SMWT) and cardiac catheterization at the beginning and the end of the 12 weeks. The primary end point was the changes in exercise capacity assessed by SMWT; the secondary end point included assessment of functional class, evaluation of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, and clinical worsening (defined as death, transplantation, and rehospitalization for PAH). Drug safety and tolerability were also examined. Results: Oral sidenafil significantly increased SMWT distances (422.94 ± 76.95 m vs. 371.99 ± 78.73 m, P < 0.0001). There was also remarkable improvement in Borg dyspnea score (2.1 ± 1.32 vs. 2.57 ± 1.42, P= 0.0307). Moreover, significant improvements in World Healthy Organization (WHO) functional class and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics were also discovered (mean pulmonary artery pressure, P= 0.0002; cardiac index, P < 0.0001; pulmonary vascular resistance, P < 0.0001). Side effects in this study were mild and consistent with reported studies. None of the enrolled patients experienced significant clinical worsening. Conclusions: This study confirmed and extended previous studies.

79952740871	OX-LDL up-regulates the vascular endothelial growth factor-to-pigment epithelium-derived factor ratio in human retinal pigment epithelial cells	Purpose: Native and oxidized (OX) low-density lipoprotein (LDL) may contribute to the pathogenesis of age related macular degeneration (AMD). In this study, we investigated the effects of lipoproteins, including LDL and ox-LDL, on cell viability, apoptosis, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) expression in cultured human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Method: ARPE-19 cells were incubated with 10-100 mg/ml n-LDL, ox-LDL for 24 hr. Cell viability was assessed using the Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay. The apoptosis of RPE was measured with TUNEL. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the levels of VEGF and PEDF mRNA in RPE cells. The expression of VEGF and PEDF protein was measured by western blotting. To examine the role of MAPK signal transduction in LDL- and OX-LDL-induced VEGF and PEDF protein expression, ARPE-19 cells were pretreated with one of several MAPK inhibitors for 2 hr and then incubated with native LDL or OX-LDL for 24 hr. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the differences. Results: OX-LDL treatment decreased ARPE-19 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, whereas native LDL had no effect. Incubation of ARPE-19 cells with 10 mg/mL OX-LDL induced marked apoptosis, compared with untreated control cells. OX-LDL also increased VEGF expression and decreased PEDF expression, whereas native LDL had no significant effect. The VEGF-to-PEDF ratio was elevated after OX-LDL treatment. OX-LDL-induced VEGF protein synthesis was partly abolished by inhibiting p38 and JNK, while inhibiting ERK did not show a significant effect. Conclusions: OX-LDL treatment induced cellular changes in ARPE-19 cells that appeared to reflect pathogenic events in neovascular AMD, providing potential insight into the roles of OX-LDL in human RPE cells and its potential role in the pathogenesis of AMD. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

79952771586	Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1 mediates VEGF-induced proliferation, migration and tube formation of retinal endothelial cells	Purpose: The potential role of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1 (IGFBP-rP1) as an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor in the prevention of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced retinal angiogenesis has not been explored. Methods: Expression of IGFBP-rP1 in rhesus macaque choroid-retinal endothelial cell line (RF/6A) cells was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis and Western blotting. RF/6A cells were treated with VEGF (10 ng/ml) alone or in the presence of IGFBP-rP1 at concentrations ranging from 50 ng/ml to 200 ng/ml. The proliferation, migration and capillary-like tube formation of RF/6A cells were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4- sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium colorimetric assay, the chemotactic motility assay and the Matrigel tube formation assay, respectively. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis of RF/6A cells, and oncogenic B-Raf expression was assessed to elucidate the pathway for IGFBP-rP1-mediated induction of apoptosis in the presence of VEGF. Results: RF/6A cells expressed both IGFBP-rP1 transcripts and IGFBP-rP1 protein. VEGF markedly stimulated proliferation, migration and capillary-like tube formation of RF/6A cells (P<0.05), whereas those VEGF-induced parameters were significantly inhibited by IGFBP-rP1 at concentrations ranging from 50 ng/ml to 200 ng/ml in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Following addition of IGFBP-rP1, expression of B-Raf was significantly decreased dose-dependently, and apoptosis occurred as evidenced by flow cytometry (P<0.05). Conclusions: IGFBP-rP1 can inhibit the stimulatory effect of VEGF on retinal angiogenesis in vitro by inhibiting expression of B-Raf to induce apoptosis. It is a novel endogenous anti-angiogenic factor with potential therapeutic action in retinal neovascularization dependent disorders. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

79957888994	Prognostic value of echocardiographic right/left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ratio in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension	Background An echocardiographic right/left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ratio (RV/LV ratio) ≥0.9 is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Right ventricular dilation is a common characteristic of both acute pulmonary embolism and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). However, the prognostic value of the RV/LV ratio in patients with IPAH is unknown. Methods Ninety-five consecutive patients with newly diagnosed IPAH were included, 17 were re-evaluated by echocardiography after 3-12 months of targeted therapy. Follow-up data were obtained by telephone interviews and review of the patients' records. Results Higher RV/LV ratios were associated with greater functional impairment and with a higher mean right atrial pressure. The RV/LV ratio was positively correlated with pulmonary vascular resistance (r=0.549, P <0.001) and plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level (r=0.575, P <0.001), but negatively correlated with cardiac output (r= -0.517, P <0.001) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (r= -0.599, P <0.001). During a follow-up period of (21 ± 15) months, 27 patients died. Sensitivity and specificity of an RV/LV ratio ≥0.84 for predicting death were 85.2% and 51.5%, respectively. The RV/LV ratio and body mass index were independent predictors of death by multivariate Cox analysis (P <0.01). A baseline RV/LV ratio ≥0.84 or a further increase in the RV/LV ratio during targeted therapy indicated a poor prognosis (P <0.01). Conclusion The RV/LV ratio helps to assess the severity of IPAH and may serve as an independent predictor of prognosis in patients with IPAH.

80051519486	Snail involves in the transforming growth factor β1-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition of retinal pigment epithelial cells	Background: The proliferation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells resulting from an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), which leads to complex retinal detachment and the loss of vision. Genes of Snail family encode the zinc finger transcription factors that have been reported to be essential in EMT during embryonic development and cancer metastasis. However, the function of Snail in RPE cells undergoing EMT is largely unknown. Principal Findings: Transforming growth factor beta(TGF-β)-1 resulted in EMT in human RPE cells (ARPE-19), which was characterized by the expected decrease in E-cadherin and Zona occludin-1(ZO-1) expression, and the increase in fibronectin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, as well as the associated increase of Snail expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, TGF-β1 treatment caused a significant change in ARPE-19 cells morphology, with transition from a typical epithelial morphology to mesenchymal spindle-shaped. More interestingly, Snail silencing significantly attenuated TGF-β1-induced EMT in ARPE-19 cells by decreasing the mesenchymal markers fibronectin and a-SMA and increasing the epithelial marker E-cadherin and ZO-1. Snail knockdown could effectively suppress ARPE-19 cell migration. Finally, Snail was activated in epiretinal membranes from PVR patients. Taken together, Snail plays very important roles in TGF-β-1-induced EMT in human RPE cells and may contribute to the development of PVR. Significance: Snail transcription factor plays a critical role in TGF-β1-induced EMT in human RPE cells, which provides deep insight into the pathogenesis of human PVR disease. The specific inhibition of Snail may provide a new approach to treat and prevent PVR. © 2011 Li et al.

80051549897	The efficacy and safety of sildenafil in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with the different types of congenital heart disease	Background: The difference in underlying pathophysiology in different congenital heart disease (CHD) may have an influence on clinical outcome. It remains unclear whether the effect of sildenafil on pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) varies in different types of CHD. Hypothesis: The potential effect of sildenafil on pulmonary arterial hypertension related to CHD may be associated with shunt location. Methods: In this 12-week, prospective, open label, multicenter trial, 55 patients with CHD were divided into the 3 groups: atrial septal defects group (ASD, n = 15), ventricular septal defects group (VSD, n = 24), and patent ductus arteriosus group (PDA, n = 16). Exercise capacity, hemodynamic parameters, and arterial oxygen saturation were assessed at baseline and after sildenafil therapy (25 mg, 3 times daily). Results: Six-minute walk distance significantly increased from 377.2 Â± 68.7 m to 436.0 Â± 70.4 m in patients with ASD, from 371.2 Â± 66.0 m to 413.7 Â± 83.1 m in VSD, and from 384.3 Â± 90.2 m to 440.9 Â± 71.8 m in PDA (P<0.01, respectively). Moreover, sildenafil also improved the pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary blood flow index in the 3 groups, whereas no significant changes in systemic vascular resistance and systemic arterial pressure were observed. However, arterial oxygen saturation was significantly improved in the ASD group only. The incidence of adverse events was similar among the 3 groups. Conclusions: Sildenafil therapy seems to be effective and safe for PAH secondary to ASD, VSD, and PDA, although some clinical and hemodynamic parameters were changed in a different manner among the 3 groups. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

80255137246	Effects of a novel peptide derived from human thrombomodulin on endotoxin-induced uveitis in vitro and in vivo	Thrombomodulin (TM) is a single-transmembrane glycoprotein receptor for thrombin, which is best known as a cofactor for thrombin-mediated activation of anticoagulant protein C. C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) of TM has distinct coagulation/fibrinolysis-independent anti-inflammatory properties. Here we found anti-inflammatory effects of a novel peptide (GC31) from CTLD of TM in endotoxin-induced uveitis, which was characterized by a reduction of leukocyte counts, protein concentration, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 levels in aqueous humor. Through in vitro experiments, we further found that GC31 suppressed TNF-α and interleukin (IL)-6 expressions in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells and interrupted LPS-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. These data indicate a beneficial role of peptide GC31 in preventing intraocular inflammatory response, especially uveitis. © 2011 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

80655147260	The antiangiogenic effects of integrin α5β1 inhibitor (ATN-161) in vitro and in vivo	Purpose. Integrin α5β1 is involved in the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Thus, the inhibition of integrin α5β1 may provide an alternative to the current standard of CNV therapy, which involves inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and is not effective in all patients. This study evaluated the antiangiogenic effects of ATN-161, a small peptide inhibitor of integrin α5β1, in human choroidal endothelial cells (hCECs) and in laser-induced CNV in rats. Furthermore, the utility of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) for dynamic observation of the development of CNV in animal models was assessed. Methods. The antiangiogenic potential of ATN-161 was evaluated in VEFG-stimulated hCECs by MTS proliferation assays, migration assays, and synthetic matrix capillary tube formation assays. To evaluate the antiangiogenic effects of ATN-161 in vivo, CNV was induced in rats by laser photocoagulation. ATN-161, scrambled peptide, or AF564 anti-VEGF antibody, were injected intravitreally immediately after photocoagulation. Eyes were examined by SD-OCT and fluorescein angiography on days 1, 7, and 14 after injection, and the areas of CNV were measured by analysis of choroidal flatmounts at day 14. Results. ATN-161 inhibited VEGF-induced migration and capillary tube formation in hCECs, but did not inhibit proliferation. In vivo, injection of ATN-161 after laser photocoagulation inhibited CNV leakage and neovascularization to an extent similar to AF564. Furthermore, SD-OCT and histologic examinations indicated that ATN-161 significantly decreased the size of laser-induced lesions. Conclusions. Integrin α5β1 inhibition by ATN-161 may be a promising alternative therapy for CNV-related angiogenesis. In addition, SD-OCT technology allows excellent visualization of experimentally induced CNV in vivo. © 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

83355172991	A novel peptide derived from human pancreatitis-associated protein inhibits inflammation in vivo and in vitro and blocks NF-kappa b signaling pathway	Background: Pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) is a pancreatic secretory protein belongs to the group VII of C-type lectin family. Emerging evidence suggests that PAP plays a protective effect in inflammatory diseases. In the present study, we newly identified a 16-amino-acid peptide (named PAPep) derived from C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) of human PAP with potent anti-inflammatory activity using both in vivo and in vitro assays. Methodology/Principal Findings: We assessed the anti-inflammatory effect of PAPep on endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats and demonstrated that intravitreal pretreatment of PAPep concentration-dependently attenuated clinical manifestation of EIU rats, reduced protein leakage and cell infiltration into the aqueous humor (AqH), suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 production in ocular tissues, and improved histopathologic manifestation of EIU. Furthermore, PAPep suppressed the LPS-induced mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in RAW 264.7 cells, inhibited protein expression of ICAM-1 in TNF-α-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as well as U937 cells adhesion to HUVECs. Western blot analysis in ocular tissues and different cell lines revealed that the possible mechanism for this anti-inflammatory effect of PAPep may depend on its ability to inhibit the activation of NF-kB signaling pathway. Conclusions/Significance: Our studies provide the first evidence that the sequence of PAPep is within the critically active region for the anti-inflammatory function of PAP and the peptide may be a promising candidate for the management of ocular inflammatory diseases. © 2011 Yang et al.

84555188488	Sirtuin 1-mediated cellular metabolic memory of high glucose via the LKB1/AMPK/ROS pathway and therapeutic effects of metformin	Cellular metabolic memory occurs in diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and metformin in this phenomenon. In bovine retinal capillary endothelial cells (BRECs) and retinas of diabetic rats, the inflammatory gene, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and the proapoptotic gene, Bax, induced by hyperglycemia, remained elevated after returning to normoglycemia. BRECs with small interfering RNA-mediated SIRT1 knockdown had increased sensitivity to hyperglycemia stress, whereas SIRT1 overexpression or activation by metformin inhibited the increase of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species-mediated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity through the upregulation of liver kinase B1/AMP-activated protein kinase (LKB1/AMPK), ultimately suppressing NF-κB and Bax expression. Furthermore, we showed that hyperglycemia led to PARP activation, which in turn may have downregulated SIRT1. Of importance, this study also demonstrated that metformin suppressed the "memory"of hyperglycemia stress in the diabetic retinas, which may be involved in the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK pathway. Our data suggest that SIRT1 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of the cellular metabolic memory, and the use of metformin specifically for such therapy may be a new avenue of investigation in the diabetes field. © 2012 by the American Diabetes Association.

84856023717	A rat model for studying the biological effects of circulating LDL in the choriocapillaris-BrM-RPE complex	Retention of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins in Bruch's membrane (BrM) is believed to be important in early age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The origin of the lipoproteins in BrM is a hot topic in AMD research. Some studies hypothesize an intraocular origin. BrM is in direct contact to the choriocapillaris; a plasma origin has also been suggested for the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. We developed an animal model to study the biological effects of circulating LDL on the retina. After injection of LDL for 7 days, our results showed evidence of circulating apolipoprotein B100 retention in BrM and showed induction of early AMD-like alterations in the rat retina, such as thickening of BrM, photoreceptor TUNEL-positive cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration. In vitro assays showed that oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) treatment decreased ARPE-19 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and that 10 mg/L ox-LDL induced marked apoptosis. The ratio of matrix metalloproteinase-2 to tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-3 was dysregulated after LDL and ox-LDL treatment in ARPE-19 cells, which can produce profound changes in the extracellular matrix, including thickening of and deposit formation in BrM. The observation that circulating LDL may be a significant, but not complete, origin of the lipoprotein in BrM suggests that these findings can be readily exploited for the development of new model systems and the future benefit of patients with AMD. © 2012 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

84860148526	Oral sildenafil therapy for Chinese patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension: A multicenter study	The impact of sildenafil on pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in Chinese patients has been less investigated. A prospective, open-label, uncontrolled and multicenter study, therefore, was carried out to address this issue. Ninety patients with multicause-induced PAH received oral sildenafil (75 mg/day) for 12 weeks. The 6-minute walk test (SMWT) and cardiac catheterization were performed at the beginning and the end of the 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the changes in exercise capacity assessed by the SMWT; the secondary endpoint included assessment of functional class, evaluation of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, and clinical worsening. Drug safety and tolerability were also examined. The results showed that there was a significant improvement in SMWT distances (342 ± 93 m vs 403 ± 88 m, P <.0001), Borg dyspnea score (2.9 ± 2.6 vs 2.4 ± 2.0, P =.0046), World Health Organization functional class, and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics (mean pulmonary artery pressure, P <.0001; cardiac index, P <.0001; pulmonary vascular resistance, P <.0001) after 12 weeks of oral sidenafil therapy. Almost all enrolled patients did not experience significant clinical worsening. This study confirms and extends the findings of previous studies relating to effects of sildenafil on PAH, suggesting that oral sildenafil is safe and effective for the treatment of adult patients with PAH in the Chinese population. © 2012 American College of Clinical Pharmacology, Inc.

84862060269	Inhibitory effect of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1 on retinal angiogenesis in vitro	Background: Antagonists against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) play key roles in treating and preventing neovascular ophthalmopathy. As a novel anti-angiogenic factor, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1 (IGFBP-rP1) might be an antagonist against VEGF in eye. Objective: This study was to explore the inhibitory effect of IGFBP-rP1, a novel anti-angiogenic factor, on VEGF-induced retinal angiogenesis in vitro. Methods: The retina-choroid endothelial cell line (RF/6A) was cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Culture cells were divided into control group(free-serum culture group), 10 mg/L VEGF culture group and different concentrations of IGFBP-rP1 (50, 100, 200 mg/L) +10 mg/L VEGF group. The expression of IGFBP-rP1 in the cells was detected by immunofluorescence assay. The proliferation and migration of RF/6A cells were evaluated using MTS colorimetric assay and the chemotactic motility assay, respectively. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis of RF/6A cells. Results The immunofluorescence assay RF/6A cells showed the green fluorescence in cytoplasm and red fluorescence in nuclei after cells were exposed to any concentration of IGFBP-rP1, but only red fluorescence was seen in nuclei in control cells.

84862065730	A novel approach to attenuate proliferative vitreoretinopathy using ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction and recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated RNA interference targeting transforming growth factor-β2 and platelet-derived growth factor-B	Background: To date, with the exception of surgery, there are no satisfactory treatments available for proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) represents a new approach for the gene therapy of eye diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the feasibility of the attenuation of PVR by a combinatorial use of UTMD and recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) targeting transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B. Methods: One hundred and eighty rats of the PVR model were averagely divided into six groups (G). The left eyes, respectively, received an intravitreal injection as follows: normal saline (G1), rAAV2-control small interfering RNA (siRNA) (G2), rAAV2-TGF-β2-siRNA (G3), rAAV2-PDGF-B-siRNA (G4), rAAV2-TGF-β2-siRNA and rAAV2-PDGF-B-siRNA (G5, G6) on day 3 after PVR induction. In G6, a condition of UTMD was used additionally. On days 14 and 28, pathological changes of eye fundus were assessed by ophthalmoscopic and histopathologic examination, and the protein and mRNA levels of TGF-β2 and PDGF-B expression were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Results: The average grade scales of proliferation and the protein and mRNA expression levels of TGF-β2 and PDGF-B in G6 were all lower than that in G5 on day 28 (p<0.05, unpaired t-test). They were all lower in G5 and G6 than in G1, G2, G3 and G4 on day 28 (p<0.05, one-way analysis of variance), although the protein and mRNA expression levels of PDGF-B in G6 did not differ from that in G1, G2, G3, G4 and G5 on day 14. Conclusions: The combinatorial use of UTMD and rAAV2-mediated RNAi targeting TGF-β2 and PDGF-B can serve as a novel approach to attenuate PVR. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84862189923	Inhaled low-dose iloprost for pulmonary hypertension: A prospective, multicenter, open-label study	Background: Inhaled iloprost (average >30 μg/d) has been considered an effective treatment for severe pulmonary hypertension (PH). Further evidence also showed that low-dose iloprost given intravenously was equally effective as high-dose iloprost in the therapy of systemic sclerosis. Hypothesis: Patients with pulmonary hypertension will benefit from inhalation of low-dose iloprost. Methods: Sixty-two patients with PH were enrolled and initiated with neubulizedlow-dose iloprost (2.5 μg per inhalation, 6x daily) for 24 weeks in 13 medical centers in China. Efficacy endpoints included changes in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), World Health Organization functional class (WHO-FC), and hemodynamic parameters. Results: Fourteen patients (22.6%) prematurely discontinued the study: 8 due to clinical worsening (6 in WHO-FCIII-IV at baseline), 4 because of protocol change, and 2 patients lost during follow-up. In the remaining 48 patients, 6MWD was increased from 356 ± 98 meters to 414 ± 99 meters (P < 0.001) and WHO-FC improved significantly (P = 0.006) after 24-week inhalation therapy. Cardiac output, cardiac index, and mixed venous oxygen saturation improved significantly compared with baseline (n = 34, P < 0.05). Most of the hemodynamic parameters improved significantly in patients in WHO-FC II (P < 0.05) but not in patients in WHO-FCIII-IV. Conclusions: Low-dose iloprost inhalation significantly improved exercise capacity and functional status in patients with PH. It was well tolerated. The improvement of hemodynamics was confirmed in patients with WHO-FCI-II but not in patients with WHO-FCIII-IV, suggesting the importance of early treatment in patients with advanced disease stages. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential photoprotective activity of methanesulfonic acid sodium salt in a model of light-induced retinopathy. Methods One hundred mice were assigned randomly into vehicle (V), methanesulfonic acid sodium salt (D), light damage model plus vehicle (MV) and light damage model plus methanesulfonic acid sodium salt (MD) groups (n=25 each). In the MD group, methanesulfonic acid sodium salt (100 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection 30 minutes before light exposure. Twenty-four hours after light exposure, hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for histological evaluation. The thickness of the outer plus inner-segment and outer nuclear layer was measured on sections parallel to the vertical meridian of the eye at a distance of 1000 μm from the optic nerve. Electroretinography (ERG) test was performed to assess the functional change. The morphology of mitochondria was also revealed by TEM. Finally, the expression of cytochrome c (CytC) and the relative apoptotic proteins were detected by Western blotting, and the interaction between mitochondrial proteins was investigated by co-immunoprecipitation. Results The photoreceptor inner and outer segments of the MV group were significantly disorganized than the MD group. The thicknesses of the outer plus inner-segment layers and the outer nuclear layer, and the amplitudes of the a and b waves of the scotopic ERG response markedly decreased in the MV group compared to those in the MD group (P <0.05). TEM examination revealed that the mitochondria of the MV group were distinctly swollen and contained disrupted cristae. In contrast, the morphology of mitochondria in the MD group was unaffected. Western blotting analysis showed that CytC, apoptosis proteinase activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), caspase 3, p53, p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), Bax, and Bad were increased, whereas the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-X

This study investigates the potential therapeutic benefits of atorvastatin as an affordable treatment for pulmonary hypertension patients. 220 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) were randomised, double-blind, to receive atrovastatin 10 mg daily or matching placebo in addition to supportive care. At 6 months, 6-min walk distance decreased by 16.6 m in the atorvastatin group and 14.1 m in the placebo group. The mean placebo-corrected treatment effect was -2.5 m (95% CI: -38-33; p50.96), based on intention to treat. A small nonsignificant increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and fall in cardiac output was seen in both treatment groups. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who improved, remained stable or showed a deterioration in World Health Organization functional class between atorvastatin and placebo treatments. Nine patients died in the atorvastatin group and 11 in the placebo group. Serum cholesterol levels fell significantly on atorvastatin treatment. Discontinuation rates were 23.2% and 26.9% on atorvastatin and placebo, respectively. Atorvastatin 10 mg daily has no beneficial effect on the natural history of PAH or CTEPH over 6 months.

84866008341	Impact of sildenafil on survival of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension	It has been reported that short-term sildenafil therapy is safe and effective for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, data regarding the impact of sildenafil on the survival of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension remain limited. The study was conducted on 77 patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension at Fu Wai Hospital between September 2005 and September 2009. Patients were divided into 2 groups: the sildenafil group and the conventional group. Nine patients treated with sildenafil were re-evaluated by right heart catheterization after 3 months. Our data demonstrated that the 6-minute walk distance, World Health Organization functional class, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and hemodynamics significantly improved after 3 months of sildenafil therapy (P <.05). The baseline characteristics of the sildenafil group were similar to those of the conventional group. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates in the sildenafil group were 88%, 72%, and 68% compared with 61%, 36%, and 27% in the conventional group (P <.001). The absence of sildenafil therapy, lower body mass index, and lower mixed venous oxygen saturation were found to be independent predictors of mortality. In conclusion, sildenafil therapy was found to be associated with improved survival in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. © 2012 The Author(s).

84866909750	In vitro biocompatibility of a platinum-electrode embedded photosensitive polyimide (durimide) retinal prosthesis	Purpose: The photosensitive polyimide film, Durimide, is a common component of retinal prostheses; however, retinal cell response to Durimide has not been effectively studied This work assessed the in vitro biocompatibility of a retinal prosthesis containing platinum-electrode embedded Durimide film. Materials and methods: Biocompatibility evaluation assessed cytotoxicity, attachment, and proliferation of two cell lines: a human retinal pigmented epithelium cell line (CRL) and a rhesus monkey choroid-retinal endothelial cell line (RF/6A). Cells were cultured with the platinum-electrode embedded Durimide film, with tissue-culture treated polystyrene plates (TCPS) used as a control substrate for cell growth. The effect of a Durimide-exposed medium on cell apoptosis and life cycle was assessed using flow cytometry (FCM). Results: The indirect cytotoxicity evaluation revealed no toxic effect of the prosthesis on cells. The attachment and proliferation of CRL and RF/6A cells cultured with the Durimide prostheses showed no significant differences to the control. The FCM experiments demonstrated a liquid medium exposed to the prosthesis had no effects on apoptosis or cell life cycle in comparison with the control (p > 0.05). Conclusions: The results demonstrate that Durimide has good biocompatibility with retinal cell lines CRL and RF/6A. In conclusion, while further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to clarify long-term effects, Durimide is indicated as a promising material with suitable biocompatibility for retinal implants. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

84868089350	Necrostatin-1 protects photoreceptors from cell death and improves functional outcome after experimental retinal detachment	Necroptosis is a recently discovered programmed necrosis. Evidence demonstrated the importance of necroptosis in neuronal cell death. Necrostatin-1 is a specific inhibitor of necroptosis. In this study, we investigated the role of necrostatin-1 on photoreceptor survival and functional protection after experimental retinal detachment (RD) in rats. Necrostatin-1/inactive analogue of necrostatin-1 was introduced into the subretinal space at RD induction and 6 hours afterward, respectively. We found that necrostatin-1 attenuated retinal histopathological damage and reduced plasma membrane breakdown (a morphological hallmark of necroptosis) in outer retinal layers. Transmission electron microscopy showed that necrostatin-1 directly protected neurons by inhibiting necroptotic, not apoptotic, cell death. Treatment with necrostatin-1 inhibited the induction of receptor-interacting protein kinase phosphorylation after RD (a biomarker of necroptosis). Finally, electroretinographic recording proved that necrostatin-1 contributed to objective functional improvement after RD. These findings indicate that necrostatin-1 is a promising therapeutic agent that protects photoreceptors from necroptosis and improves functional outcome. © 2012 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

84869746561	Preliminary study on the efficacy and safety of oral sildenafil in pulmonary arterial hypertension in China	Objective: Sildenafil has been shown to be effective in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, the impact of sildenafil on PAH has been under-investigated in China. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral sildenafil in PAH patients in China. Methods: In this prospective, open-label and multi-center study, 90 patients were recruited from 14 centers to receive oral sildenafil (75 mg/d) for 12 weeks. They underwent a six-minute walk test (SMWT) and cardiac catheterization at the beginning and the end of 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the changes in exercise capacity as assessed by SMWT. And the secondary endpoints included assessment of functional class, evaluation of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics and clinical deterioration (defined as death, transplantation and re-hospitalization for PAH). Drug safety and tolerability were also examined. Results: There were 19 males and 71 females with an average age of 32.5 ± 12.1 years old (range; 18-61). Their etiologies were idiopathic (n = 15), related with congenital heart disease (n-60), or related with connective tissue disease (n = 9) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (n = 6). Oral sildenafil significantly increased the SMWT distances [(342 ± 93) m vs. (403 ± 88) m, P <0.001]. There was also remarkable improvement in Borg dyspnea score (2.9 ± 2.6 vs. 2.4 ± 2.0, P = 0.005). Furthermore, significant improvements in World Healthy Organization (WHO) functional class and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics were also found (mean pulmonary artery pressure, P < 0.001; cardiac index, P < 0.001; pulmonary vascular resistance, P <0.001). Side effects were mild and consistent with other reports. Conclusion: This study confirms and extends previous studies. Oral sildenafil is both safe and effective for the treatment of adult PAH patients in China. © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84873565861	Effects of a thrombomodulin-derived peptide on monocyte adhesion and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression in lipopolysaccharide-induced endothelial cells	Purpose: It has been documented that GC31, a 31-animo acid peptide from human thrombomodulin, has potent antiinflammatory properties in endotoxin-induced uveitis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells, while the role of GC31 in the endothelial cells has not yet been fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the effect of GC31 on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in LPS-activated endothelial cells. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with LPS (1 μg/ml) and peptide GC31 or control peptide VP30 simultaneously. ICAM-1 messenger RNA and protein levels were evaluated with real-time PCR and western blot. The adhesion of U937 cells labeled with CM-H2DCFDA to HUVECs was examined with fluorescence microscope. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B alpha (IκBα) degradation, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) nuclear translocation were detected with western blot. Results: Upon LPS stimulation, GC31 suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of ICAM-1 in HUVECs and remarkably reduced monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, GC31 significantly inhibited the degradation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of NF-κB and moderately blocked the activation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 in activated HUVECs. Conclusions: Our results suggested that GC31 suppressed LPS-mediated ICAM-1 expression by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and partially by attenuating the activity of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in vascular endothelium, which may contribute to ameliorating vascular inflammatory diseases, such as uveitis. © 2013 Molecular Vision.

84874476189	Hydrogen-rich saline prevents early neurovascular dysfunction resulting from inhibition of oxidative stress in STZ-diabetic rats	Purpose: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterized by increased oxidative and nitrosative stress, both of which lead to neurotoxicity and vascular permeability. Previous studies on a variety of organs indicate that hydrogen-rich saline not only has considerable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but also suppresses oxidative stress-induced injury. In the present study, we assessed the effects of hydrogen-rich saline on neurovascular dysfunction and oxidative stress in an animal model (rat) of DR. Materials and Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) were injected intraperitoneally with 5 ml/kg hydrogen-saturated (experimental) or plain (control) saline daily for one month. Visual function and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) integrity were evaluated by electroretinography (ERG) and bovine serum albumin (BSA)-fluorescence, respectively. Histological changes in the inner retina were assessed by light microscopy. Biomarkers of oxidative stress, including 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 8-hydroxy-2- deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), and antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione transferase, were evaluated by ELISA. Synaptophysin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were measured by immunoblotting. Results: STZ-diabetic rats were marked by clearly reduced b-wave amplitudes and oscillatory potentials, DM-related BRB breakdown and histological changes in the inner retina, all of which were suppressed following treatment with hydrogen-rich saline. Furthermore, hydrogen-rich saline reduced oxidative stress, increased antioxidant enzyme activities and preserved synaptophysin and BDNF levels in the diabetic rat retina. Conclusions: Based on its inhibition of oxidative stress and up-regulation of anti-oxidative enzymes, we conclude that hydrogen-rich saline is a potentially valuable therapeutic modality for the treatment of DR. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

84880254046	Impact of sildenafil on survival of patients with eisenmenger syndrome	The favorable effects of short-term use of sildenafil on patients with Eisenmenger syndrome have been reported. We further studied the impact of long-term use of sildenafil on survival of these patients. In this study, the baseline data of patients newly diagnosed as Eisenmenger syndrome in our hospital between January 2005 and December 2009 were retrospectively collected. Patients were followed-up either by telephone contacts or during visits in our out-patient clinic. A total of 121 patients (68 patients in conventional group and 53 patients in sildenafil group) were finally included and 29 patients were re-evaluated after sildenafil therapy for 3-4 months. Compared with the baseline, a 6-minute walk distance, functional classes, plasma hemoglobin level, and hemodynamics were significantly improved after sildenafil treatment. During a median follow-up period of 35.8 months, 15 patients died (11 patients in conventional group). The 1- and 3-year survival rates in sildenafil group were 97.0% and 95.2%, significantly higher than 90.6% and 82.9% in conventional group P = .025). Multivariate analysis showed that sildenafil therapy, functional class and mean pulmonary arterial pressure were independently associated with survival. Therefore, long-term sildenafil therapy improved survival in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome. © The Author(s) 2013.

84881488279	Echocardiographic Parameters in Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: Correlations with Right Ventricular Ejection Fraction Derived from Cardiac Magnetic Resonance and Hemodynamics	Background:Echocardiography is the most convenient method used to evaluate right ventricular function, and several echocardiographic parameters were studied in previous studies. But the value of these parameters to assess the right ventricular function in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has not been well defined.Methods:Patients with PAH were observed prospectively. Right heart catheterization, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) were performed within 1 week interval. The correlations between echocardiographic parameters and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) derived from CMR as well as hemodynamics were analyzed.Results:Thirty patients were enrolled including 24 with idiopathic PAH, 5 with PAH associated with connective tissue diseases and 1 with hereditary PAH. All echocardiographic parameters except right ventricular myocardial performance index (RVMPI) correlated significantly with RVEF (tricuspid annual plane systolic excursion [TAPSE], r = 0.440, P = 0.015; tricuspid annular systolic excursion velocity [S'], r = 0.444, P = 0.016; isovolumic acceleration [IVA], r = 0.600, P = 0.001; right ventricular fraction area change [RVFAC], r = 0.416, P = 0.022; ratio of right ventricular transverse diameter to left ventricular transverse diameter [RVETD/LVETD], r = -0.649, P<0.001; RVMPI, r = -0.027, P = 0.888). After adjusted for mean right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), only IVA and RVETD/LVETD could independently predict RVEF. Four echocardiographic parameters displayed significant correlations with PVR (TAPSE, r = -0.615, P<0.001; S', r = -0.557, P = 0.002; RVFAC, r = -0.454, P = 0.012; RVETD/LVETD, r = 0.543, P = 0.002).Conclusions:The echocardiographic parameters IVA and RVETD/LVETD can reflect RVEF independently regardless of hemodynamics in patients with PAH. In addition, TAPSE, S', RVFAC and RVETD/LVETD can also reflect PVR in PAH patients. © 2013 Yang et al.

84883806862	A specific genomic organization and a novel promoter sequence for both ZP2 and ZP3 gene expressions in the Pingxiang red transparent crucian carp, Carassius auratus var. pingxiangnensis	We cloned the full-length cDNA of ZP2 from Carassius auratus var. Pingxiangnensis (CaP-ZP2) and identified a cluster of three ZP genes through its DNA walker. These three genes, CaP-ZP3.1, CaP-ZP2 and CaP-ZP3.2 were located within a 10,855 bp region and each comprised of eight exons spanning 1348 bp, 1638 bp and 1348 bp, respectively. Protein bands of egg membrane between 40 and 70 kDa were in concordance with the deduced amino acid of these three CaP-ZP genes cDNA and with their molecular mass. This is the first report that two CaP-ZP3 genes were separated by CaP-ZP2 gene. A novel sequence of 1097 bp, located between CaP-ZP2 and CaP-ZP3.2, was inserted into the modified pAcGFP1-1 vector in the forward and reverse directions. Results showed that individual sequence served as promoters utilizing common regulatory elements in the forward and reverse directions for both CaP-ZP2 and CaP-ZP3.2 gene expressions. In situ hybridization against CaP-ZP2 confirmed that a strong positive signal was detected in the early development oocytes. Similarly, real-time PCR results also showed that CaP-ZP2 transcription increased mainly in a 4-8 month ovary, but was decreased dramatically in a 9-12 month ovary. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84885151256	Outcomes and possible risk factors associated with axis alignment and rotational stability after implantation of the Toric implantable collamer lens for high myopic astigmatism	AIM: To assess the visual outcomes and possible risk factors associated with axis alignment and rotational stability after implantation of Toric implantable collamer lens (TICL) for the correction of high myopic astigm atism. METHODS: In this prospective, nonrandomized clinical study, 54 consecutiv eeyes of 29 patients with high myopic astigm atism received TICL implantation. To evaluate postoperativ eaxis deviation from the intended axis, a digital anterior segment photograph was taken. The ultrasound biom icroscopy (UBM) was used to observe footplate-position. RESULTS: After mean follow-up of 8.6 months, mean manifest refractivecy linder (MRC) decreased 79.3% from (-1.88±1.49)D preoperatively to (0.39±0.61)Dpostoperatively. MRC within 1.00 Doccurred in 68.5 % (37/54) of eyes, whereas 48.1 % (26/54) had MRC within 0.50 D. Mean manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) changed from (-12.08±4.22)D preoperatively to (-0.41 ±0.61)Dpostoperatively. Uncorrected binocular vision of 20/20 or better occurred in 72.2% (39/54) of patients com pared with binocular best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/20 or better in 44.4% (24/54) preoperatively. The mean difference between intended and achiev ed TICL axes was (6.96±8.37)°. Footplates of TICLs were in the ciliary sulcus in 22 eyes (46.3 %), below the ciliary sulcus in 32 eyes (53.7 %). The angle of TICL rotation had significant correlation with the footplates-position (t=2.127; P=0.045) and the postoperative TICL vaulting (r=-0.516; P=0.000). CONCLUSION: The results of our study further support the safety, efficacy and predictability of TICL for the correct high myopic astigm atism. The footplate-position of TICL and vault value should be taken into consideration as two possible risks factors for TICL rotation. Copyright International Journal of Ophthalmology Press.

0142075849	Effects of Primary Metronidazole and Clarithromycin Resistance to Helicobacter pylori on Omeprazole, Metronidazole, and Clarithromycin Triple-Therapy Regimen in a Region with High Rates of Metronidazole Resistance	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of metronidazole resistance (MtzR) and clarithromycin resistance (CIaR) on the eradication rate for omeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole triple-therapy regimen and on the development of posttherapy drug resistance in a region of high rates of MtzR. One hundred ninety-six Helicobacter pylori isolates were recovered from patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, or nonulcer dyspepsia during upper endoscopy. The prevalences of MtzR, ClaR, and dual resistance were 37.8%, 13.8%, and 8.7%, respectively. The intention-to-treat eradication rates for metronidazole-susceptible (87.2% vs. 67.6%; P = .001) and clarithromycin-susceptible (86.4% vs. 40.7%; P < .001 ) strains were significantly higher than the rates for resistant strains. Multiple logistic regression analysis implicated younger age (<40 years old), MtzR, ClaR, and the diagnosis of nonulcer dyspepsia as independent factors that predicted treatment failure. The rates of posttreatment MtzR, ClaR, and dual resistance were 88%, 88%, and 75%, respectively. MtxR and ClaR significantly affected the success of eradication therapy. Posttreatment rates of resistance were high and were related to the presence of pretreatment antibiotic resistance.

The interaction between aspirin and H pylori in vitro is also not clear. We investigated the effect of aspirin on the growth of H pylori and on the susceptibility, of H pylori to antimicrobials. Methods: Time killing studies of H pylori were performed with different concentrations of aspirin and salicylate. Growth of bacteria was assessed spectrophotometrically and by viable colony count. The effects of aspirin on the efficiency of colony formation and on metronidazole induced mutation to rifampicin resistance in H pylori were determined. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of aspirin and metronidazole were tested by the standard agar dilution method. MICs of amoxycillin and darithromycin were determined by the E test method. Results: Aspirin and salicylate inhibited the growth of H pylori in a dose dependent manner and bactericidal activity was due to cell lysis. Aspirin 400 μg/ml caused a 2 logs decrease in colony forming units/ml at 48 hours, and suppressed the normal ability of metronidazole to induce new mutations to rifampicin. The IC

84888089206	Expression pattern of the zona pellucida 3 (ZP3) gene during ovarian development and the location of ZP3 protein in oocytes in a natural, wild triploid crucian carp mutant, Carassius auratus var. Pingxiangnensis	Carassius auratus var. Pingxiangnensis (designated CaP), distributed in the Pingxiang region of Jiangxi Province, China, is a natural, wild triploid crucian carp mutant that has two reproductive development modes: gynogenesis and bisexual reproduction. Little information is available about the expression pattern of the zona pellucida 3 (ZP3) gene during ovarian development and the location of the ZP3 protein in oocytes of this fish. In this study, we obtained the full-length cDNA of ZP3 (CaP_ZP3). CaP_ZP3 contains an open reading frame of 1305 bp that encodes 435 amino acid residues. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine the CaP_ZP3 mRNA expression levels in the ovary at different stages of maturation. Results revealed high levels of CaP_ZP3 expression in 4- to 8-month-old ovaries (stage II-stage III), with a significant decline in 9- to 12-month-old ovaries (stages IV-stage V). The high levels of CaP_ZP3 transcripts during the early growth period suggest an important role for CaP_ZP3 in early oocyte development. In addition, a polyclonal antibody was prepared against CaP_ZP3, and the immunofluorescence localization was determined. CaP_ZP3 protein was detected close to the oocyte plasma membrane. The results also showed that no fluorescent signal was detected in stage I and II oocytes. CaP_ZP3 protein is primarily detected in stage III oocytes, and the protein accumulates as oocytes develop into stage IV oocytes. These results suggested that the transcription and translation of the CaP_ZP3 gene is asynchronous and that the transcription of the CaP_ZP3 protein occurs prior to its translation in this triploid fish. © FUNPEC-RP.

84891126409	Amelioration of radiation-induced skin injury by HIV-TAT-mediated protein transduction of RP-1 from Rana pleurade	Radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage DNA and most other biological macromolecules in skin and radiation-induced skin injury is a serious concern for radiation therapy. Skin possesses an extremely efficient antioxidant system, which is conferred by two systems: antioxidant enzymes and small molecules that can scavenge ROS by donating electrons. Amphibian skin is a multifunctional organ, which protects against dangers of various oxidative stresses. Recently, a small peptide called RP-1 was isolated from the skin secretions of Rana pleurade, which shows strong antioxidant activity. However, this RP-1 peptide is limited because its inability to across the cell membrane. Protein transduction domains (PTDs) have demonstrated high efficiency for facilitating the internalization of both homologous and heterogeneous proteins into cells. This study aims to elucidate the protective effects of a HIV-TAT (TAT) PTD-coupled RP-1 fusion protein (TAT-RP1) on radiation-induced skin injury in vitro and in vivo. The synthesized fusion TAT-RP1 peptide can be incorporated into human keratinocyte HaCaT cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. We then evaluated the protective role of TAT-RP1 against ionizing radiation. TAT-RP1 supplementation increased anti-superoxide anion ability of HaCaT cells and decreased HaCaT cell radiosensitivity to irradiation. Moreover, TAT-RP1 was able to penetrate the skin of rats, entering epidermis as well as the dermis of the subcutaneous layer in skin tissue. Topical spread of TAT-RP1 promoted the amelioration of radiation-induced skin damage in rats. These results suggest that TAT-RP1 has potential as a protein therapy for radiation-induced skin injury. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

84891885437	Prostanoid therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension: A meta-analysis of survival outcomes	Background: Prostanoids have played an important role in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, whether prostanoid therapy provides a survival advantage is still not clear. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prostanoids in PAH, focusing on the improvement in overall survival. Methods: Trials were identified from the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PUBMED databases. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and weighted mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data. Results: Fourteen trials with a total of 2,244 adult patients (1,189 patients in the prostanoid treatment group and 1,055 patients in the placebo group) were included in the meta-analysis. All-cause mortality rate in the control group was 4.17 %. In a 13.4-week follow-up, prostanoid treatment was associated with a 44 % reduction in mortality (RR 0.56; 95 % CI 0.35-0.88; P = 0.01).Subgroup analysis suggested that only treatment with intravenous prostanoids provided a survival benefit. Compared with placebo, prostanoids significantly reduced clinical worsening (RR 0.60; 95 % CI 0.46-0.80; P = 0.0003), increased the 6-min walk distance by 27.95 m, reduced mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, and increased the cardiac index and mixed venous oxygen saturation. However, patients receiving prostanoid treatment showed a much higher incidence (RR 3.25; 95 % CI 2.07-5.10; P < 0.00001) of withdrawal due to its adverse effects. Conclusion: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that treatment with prostanoids improves the survival of patients with PAH. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84893768139	Protein and miRNA profiling of radiation-induced skin injury in rats: The protective role of peroxiredoxin-6 against ionizing radiation	Radiation-induced skin injury is a serious concern during radiotherapy. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of radiation-induced skin injury has not been extensively reported. Most biological functions are performed and regulated by proteins and noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs). The interplay between mRNA and miRNA has been implicated in disease initiation and progression. Technical advances in genomics and proteomics have enabled the exploration of the etiology of diseases and have the potential to broaden our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of radiation-induced skin injury. In this study, we compared the protein and miRNA expression in rat skin irradiated with a 45-Gy electron beam with expression from adjacent normal tissues. We found 24 preferentially expressed proteins and 12 dysregulated miRNAs in irradiated skin. By analyzing the protein and miRNA profiles using bioinformatics tools, we identified a possible interaction between miR-214 and peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX-6). Next, we investigated the expression of PRDX-6 and the consequences of its dysregulation. PRDX-6 is suppressed by radiation-inducible miR-214 and is involved in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced skin injury. Overexpression of PRDX-6 conferred radioresistance on cells, decreased cell apoptosis, and preserved mitochondrial integrity after radiation exposure. In addition, in vivo transfection with PRDX-6 reduced radiation-induced reactive oxygen species and the malondialdehyde concentration and ameliorated radiation-induced skin damage in rats. Our present findings illustrate the molecular changes during radiation-induced skin injury and the important role of PRDX-6 in ameliorating this damage in rats. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84898548235	The ratio of 18F-FDG activity uptake between the right and left ventricle in patients with pulmonary hypertension correlates with the right ventricular function	PURPOSE: It is known that patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) can have elevated F-FDG uptake in the right ventricle (RV) on PET imaging. This study was designed to assess possible relationship between FDG uptake of ventricles and the function/hemodynamics of the RV in patients with PH. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with PH underwent FDG PET imaging in both fasting and glucose-loading conditions. The standard uptake value (SUVs) corrected for partial volume effect in both RV and left ventricle (LV) were measured. The ratio of FDG uptake between RV to LV (SUVR/L) was calculated. Right heart catheterization and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) were performed in all patients within 1 week. The FDG uptake levels by the ventricles were compared with the result form the right heart catheterization and CMR. RESULTS: The SUV of RV (SUVR) and SUV of LV were significantly higher in glucose-loading condition than in fasting condition. In both fasting and glucose-loading conditions, SUVR and SUVR/L showed reverse correlation with right ventricular ejection fraction derived from CMR. In addition, in both fasting and glucose-loading conditions, SUVR and SUVR/L showed positive correlations with pulmonary vascular resistance. However, only SUVR/L in glucose-loading condition could independently predict right ventricular ejection fraction after adjusted for age, body mass index, sex, mean right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance (P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: The FDG uptake of RV increases with decreased right ventricular function in patients with PH.

84898946840	Red blood cell distribution width predicts survival in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome	Background: Previous studies identified an independent relationship between red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and prognosis in patients with pulmonary hypertension of mixed etiologies and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. This study aimed to investigate the significance of RDW for predicting survival in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome (ES). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records and collected baseline data for patients newly diagnosed with ES in our hospital between January 2005 and October 2009. Follow-up data were collected periodically using a specifically designed network database until December 31, 2012. The end point was all-cause death. Results: A total of 109 patients with ES were included in the study. Twenty-one patients (19.3%) died during a median follow-up period of 4.2 years (interquartile range 3.7-5.0 years). Baseline RDW was significantly correlated with mixed venous oxygen saturation (r=-0.286, p=0.003), arterial oxygen saturation (r=-0.423, p<0.001), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (r=0.271, p=0.004) and total pulmonary resistance (r=0.465, p<0.001). The 1-, 3-and 5-year survival rates for all 109 patients were 94%, 87% and 78%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with RDW ≥13.9% had a lower survival rate than patients with RDW <13.9% (p=0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that RDW was an independent prognostic marker in ES, with a hazard ratio of 1.162 (95% CI 1.036-1.302; p=0.010). Conclusions: Baseline RDW correlates with hemodynamics and is an independent prognostic marker in ES. © 2014 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.

84899116174	Elevated plasma YKL-40 as a prognostic indicator in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension	Background and objective Pulmonary vascular remodelling and inflammation have been implicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). YKL-40, a marker of tissue remodelling and inflammation, has recently been recognized as a risk predictor of cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. The study aimed to investigate a potential role of YKL-40 in predicting prognosis in idiopathic PAH (IPAH). Methods Plasma YKL-40 levels were measured in 82 IPAH patients without current or previous PAH-specific treatment during right heart catheterization and in 54 healthy volunteers. Concurrent data included clinical, haemodynamic and biochemical variables. Results Plasma YKL-40 levels were increased in IPAH patients compared with control subjects (median, interquartile range: IPAH: 24.90, 17.68-39.78 ng/mL; controls: 16.58, 14.20-19.64 ng/mL; P < 0.001). YKL-40 levels correlated with cardiac index (r = -0.244, P = 0.027) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP, r = 0.263, P = 0.017). After a median follow-up of 578 days, YKL-40 outperformed NT-proBNP, uric acid, and 6-min walk distance in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses in predicting both clinical worsening (area under the curve (AUC) 0.681) and death (AUC 0.717). Compared with patients with YKL-40 below the ROC-derived cut-off point (24.5 ng/mL), the high YKL-40 group showed higher pulmonary vascular resistance and serum uric acid levels, and showed more clinical worsening events and deaths in Kaplan-Meier analyses. Plasma YKL-40 was independently associated with clinical worsening in univariate and multivariate Cox analyses (all P < 0.05). Conclusions Plasma YKL-40 might serve as a promising indicator of disease severity and prognosis in patients with IPAH. The ability of YKL-40, an inflammation and remodelling marker, to predict prognosis of IPAH was explored. Plasma YKL-40 was significantly elevated in IPAH patients compared with healthy controls. Patients with higher YKL-40 had increased hemodynamic severity and right heart dysfunction. After follow-up, YKL-40 independently predicted clinical worsening in IPAH. © 2014 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology.

84899727212	Wnt signaling in form deprivation myopia of the mice retina	Background: The canonical Wnt signaling pathway plays important roles in cellular proliferation and differentiation, axonal outgrowth, cellular maintenance in retinas. Here we test the hypothesis that elements of the Wnt signaling pathway are involved in the regulation of eye growth and prevention of myopia, in the mouse form-deprivation myopia model. Methodology/Principal Findings: (1) One hundred twenty-five C57BL/6 mice were randomly distributed into formdeprivation myopia and control groups. Form-deprivation myopia (FDM) was induced by suturing the right eyelid, while the control group received no treatment. After 1, 2, and 4 weeks of treatment, eyes were assessed in vivo by cycloplegic retinoscopic refraction and axial length measurement by photography or A-scan ultrasonography. Levels of retinal Wnt2b, Fzd5 and β-catenin mRNA and protein were evaluated using RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. (2) Another 96 mice were divided into three groups: control, drugs-only, and drugs+FDM (by diffuser). Experimentally treated eyes in the last two groups received intravitreal injections of vehicle or the proteins, DKK-1 (Wnt-pathway antagonist) or Norrin (Wntpathway agonist), once every three days, for 4 injections total. Axial length and retinoscopic refraction were measured on the 14th day of form deprivation. Following form-deprivation for 1, 2, and 4 weeks, FDM eyes had a relatively myopic refractive error, compared with contralateral eyes. There were no significant differences in refractive error between right and left eye in control group. The amounts of Wnt2b, Fzd5 and β-catenin mRNA and protein were significantly greater in form-deprived myopia eyes than in control eyes.DKK-1 (antagonist) reduced the myopic shift in refractive error and increase in axial elongation, whereas Norrin had the opposite effect in FDM eyes. Conclusions/Significance: Our studies provide the first evidence that the Wnt2b signaling pathway may play a role in the development and progression of form-deprivation myopia, in a mammalian model. © 2014 Ma et al.

84899811389	Establishing an experimental rat model of photodynamically-induced retinal vein occlusion using erythrosin B	AIM To develop a reliable, reproducible rat model of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) with a novel photosensitizer (erythrosin B) and study the cellular responses in the retina. METHODS Central and branch RVOs were created in adult male rats via photochemically-induced ischemia. Retinal changes were m onitored via color fundus photography and fluorescein angiography at l and 3h, andi, 4, 7, 14, and2id after irradiation. Tissue slices were evaluated histopathologically. Retinal ganglion cell survival at different times after RVO induction was quantified by nuclear density count. Retinal thickness was also observed. RESULTS For all rats in both the central and branch RVO groups, blood flow ceased immediately after laser irradiation and retinal edema was evident at one hour. The retinal detachment ratewasioo% at 3h and developed into bullous retinal detachment within 24h. Retinal hemorrhages were not observed until 24h. Clearance of the occluded veins at yd was observed by fluorescein angiography. Disease manifestation in the central RVO eyes was more severe than in the branch RVO group. A remarkable reduction in the ganglion cell count and retinal thickness was observed in the central RVO group by 2 id, whereas moderate changes occurred in the branch RVO group. CONCLUSION Rat RVO created by photochemically-induced ischemia using erythrosin B is a reproducible and reliable animal model for mimicking the key features of human RVO. However, considering the 100% rate of retinal detachment, this animal model is more suitable for studying RVO with chronic retinal detachment. © International Journal of Ophthalmology Press.

84899445444	H-RN, a novel antiangiogenic peptide derived from hepatocyte growth factor inhibits inflammation in vitro and in vivo through PI3K/AKT/IKK/NF-κB signal pathway	H-RN, a novel antiangiogenic peptide derived from the kringle 1 domain of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), consists of the sequence RNPRGEEGGPW (molecular weight: 1254.34 Da). Emerging evidence indicates that HGF and the kringle domain exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory diseases. In the present study, we assessed the anti-inflammatory effect of H-RN in models of experimental ocular inflammation, including endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) and experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). The results demonstrated that intravitreal treatment of H-RN concentration-dependently suppressed clinical manifestation, inhibited ocular inflammatory cytokine production and improved histopathologic scores. Moreover, H-RN attenuated the LPS-induced mRNA and protein expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 in RAW 264.7 cells and inhibited cell chemotactic migration toward LPS. We also demonstrated that H-RN suppressed TNF-α-induced adhesion molecule expression in HUVECs, including ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin, which contributed to its suppressive effect on adherence of U937 cells to endothelial cells. We also demonstrated the possible anti-inflammation mechanism of H-RN. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining analyses revealed that H-RN significantly suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB-p65 at Ser276. Based on examination of upstream pathways, we found that H-RN inhibited PI3K-p85 and AKT

84899627188	MicroRNA-93 inhibits inflammatory cytokine production in LPS-stimulated murine macrophages by targeting IRAK4	Endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) is an animal model of acute ocular inflammation for the study of human endogenous anterior uveitis. The mechanisms accounting for the development of ocular inflammation remain hazy. MicroRNAs (mi-RNAs) have been proposed as novel regulators of inflammation. It remains unclear whether a microRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism is involved in LPS-induced EIU. In this study, we report that miR-93 expression in the eyes of EIU rats and LPS-stimulated macrophages is significantly decreased. We also show that miR-93 inhibits NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines by targeting IRAK4 expression. We further demonstrate that miR-93 inhibits IRAK4 expression by binding directly to the 3′-UTR of IRAK4. Our findings suggest that miR-93 is a negative regulator of the immune response in EIU. © 2014 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84902543835	Plasma soluble ST2 levels correlate with disease severity and predict clinical worsening in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension	Background Soluble suppression of tumorigenicity (sST2) has been proposed to be a marker for biomechanical strain and a possible predictor of mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. The use of sST2 in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has not been well defined. Hypothesis Plasma sST2 levels may correlate with the disease severity and predict clinical worsening in PAH. Methods We performed a cohort study of 40 idiopathic PAH patients with data on demographics, exercise capacity, echocardiographic parameters, laboratory tests, hemodynamics, and medications. Plasma sST2 was assessed with the high-sensitivity ST2 ELISA kit at diagnostic catheterization. All patients were followed up from the date of blood sampling. The endpoint was clinical worsening. Results sST2 was significantly elevated in patients with idiopathic PAH compared with control subjects (28.9 ± 13.9 vs 20.7 ± 7.5 ng/mL, P = 0.003). Pearson correlation analysis revealed that sST2 levels correlated with cardiac index (r = -0.534, P = 0.000) and pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.350, P = 0.027), and could reflect disease severity of PAH. After a mean follow-up of 14 ± 5 months, 12 patients showed clinical worsening. Receiver operating characteristic analysis suggested that sST2 levels >31.4 ng/mL discriminated clinical worsening with a sensitivity and specificity of 83.3% and 78.6%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that higher sST2 levels (>31.4 ng/mL) were associated with poor clinical outcomes (P = 0.008). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that sST2 was an independent predictor of clinical worsening (hazard ratio: 6.067, 95% confidence interval: 1.317-27.948, P = 0.021). Conclusions sST2 correlates with disease severity and is a significant predictor of clinical worsening in patients with PAH. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84912011162	Carbamylated erythropoietin-mediated protective effect on diabetic retinopathy and underlying mechanism	 Methods: CEPO, the derivation of EPO, was synthesized by chemical synthesis and evaluated by chromatography, enzyme digestion, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and silver nitrate dye. Sixty eight-week-old clean male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to four groups according to the random number table. Diabetic mellitus (DM) models were established by intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) in the rats of the DM group, DM+EPO group and DM+CEPO group, and equivate volume of citric acid-sodium citrate buffer solution was used in the same way in the normal control group. Four weeks later, 50 μg/kg EPO or CEPO solution was intraperitoneal injection in the rats of the DM + EPO group and DM + CEPO group, respectively, and retinal examinations were performed 2 weeks after intervention. Retinal founction was evaluated by electroretinogram (ERG), and then the rats were sacrificed. Retinal samples were prepared for the histopathological examination. Retinal gangline cells (RGCs) apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to assyed the expressions of beta-common receptor (CD131), EPO receptor (EPO-R), Thy-1, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in retina in protein and genetic levels.
