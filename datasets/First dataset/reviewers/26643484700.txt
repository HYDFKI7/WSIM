14744296578	Gene rearrangement of mitochondrial genome in the vertebrate	Up to date, complete mitochondrial genomes of 321 vertebrates are deposited in GenBank. After comparing the sequence data, we summarized the gene arrangements of these species in present study. Of those species, 81 have distinct gene rearrangements all involving tRNA genes. Among them, 9 gene rearrangements display both gene order variation and gene encoding invertion. All observed gene order changes of vertebrate mtDNAs fall into 3 categories characteristically: exchange of position between nearest neighbor genes or segments; the changes close to control region or the origin of light-strand replication, occasionally accompanying with duplication of control region; or the changes near the region originally characterized as I-Q-M. All birds, snakes, crocodiles and marsupials have their unique gene orders respectively. Gene inversion, another distinguished character of the rearrangements commonly indicated by the transfer of tRNA genes from light-strand to heavy-strand, which is more frequently observed in the fish and mammal. Three species from different classes share a complicated inversion phenomenon: all genes encoded by heavy-strand except ND6. For explanation of these rearrangements, two models, "duplication-random deletion" and "recombination", were commonly adopted by scientists. This paper also gives a brief summarization on the mechanism of these models as well as the application of gene rearrangement in phylogenetic studies.

21644447996	The complete mitochondrial genomes sequences of Asio flammeus and Asio otus and comparative analysis	The complete mitochondrial genomes of Asia flammeus and Asio otus were sequenced and found to span 18858 bp and 18493 bp, respectively. It is surprising to find the former to be the largest amo ng all avian mitochondrial genomes sequenced so far. The two genomes have very similar gene order with that of Gallus gallus, neither contains the pseudo control region, but both have a single extra base, namely Cytidine, at position 174 in ND3 gene. The control regions of Asio flammeus and Asio otus' mitochondrial genomes span 3288 bp and 2926 bp respectively, which are the longest among vertebrates except for Myxine glutinosa and contribute to the large size of two genomes. The 3′ end of the control region of Asio flammeus and Asio otus contains many tandemly repeated sequences, which are highly similar to a putative control element, i.e. Mt5, and may form stable stem-loop secondary structures. Such repeated sequences probably play an important role in regulating transcription and replication of mitochondrial genome. Our results may provide important clues for uncovering the origin and evolution mechanisms of mitochondrion genome. Copyright by Science in China Press 2004.

25144510068	Molecular phylogenetics and biogeography of Lepus in Eastern Asia based on mitochondrial DNA sequences	In spite of several classification attempts among taxa of the genus Lepus, phylogenetic relationships still remain poorly understood. Here, we present molecular genetic evidence that may resolve some of the current incongruities in the phylogeny of the leporids. The complete mitochondrial cytb, 12S genes, and parts of ND4 and control region fragments were sequenced to examine phylogenetic relationships among Chinese hare taxa and other leporids throughout the World using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction approaches. Using reconstructed phylogenies, we observed that the Chinese hare is not a single monophyletic group as originally thought. Instead, the data infers that the genus Lepus is monophyletic with three unique species groups: North American, Eurasian, and African. Ancestral area analysis indicated that ancestral Lepus arose in North America and then dispersed into Eurasia via the Bering Land Bridge eventually extending to Africa. Brooks Parsimony analysis showed that dispersal events followed by subsequent speciation have occurred in other geographic areas as well and resulted in the rapid radiation and speciation of Lepus. A Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach based on the continuous autocorrelation of evolutionary rates along branches estimated the divergence time between the three major groups within Lepus. The genus appears to have arisen approximately 10.76 MYA (± 0.86 MYA), with most speciation events occurring during the Pliocene epoch (5.65 ± 1.15 MYA ∼ 1.12 ± 0.47 MYA). © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

3042682593	Phylogeny of the bears (Ursidae) based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes	The taxomic classification and phylogenetic relationships within the bear family remain argumentative subjects in recent years. Prior investigation has been concentrated on the application of different mitochondrial (mt) sequence data, herein we employ two nuclear single-copy gene segments, the partial exon 1 from gene encoding interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) and the complete intron 1 from transthyretin (TTR) gene, in conjunction with previously published mt data, to clarify these enigmatic problems. The combined analyses of nuclear IRBP and TTR datasets not only corroborated prior hypotheses, positioning the spectacled bear most basally and grouping the brown and polar bear together but also provided new insights into the bear phylogeny, suggesting the sister-taxa association of sloth bear and sun bear with strong support. Analyses based on combination of nuclear and mt genes differed from nuclear analysis in recognizing the sloth bears as the earliest diverging species among the subfamily ursine representatives while the exact placement of the sun bear did not resolved. Asiatic and American black bears clustered as sister group in all analyses with moderate levels of bootstrap support and high posterior probabilities. Comparisons between the nuclear and mtDNA findings suggested that our combined nuclear dataset have the resolving power comparable to mtDNA dataset for the phylogenetic interpretation of the bear family. As can be seen from present study, the unanimous phylogeny for this recently derived family was still not produced and additional independent genetic markers were in need. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

33748555501	Phylogenetic analyses of fringillidae (Aves: Passeriformes) using mitochondrial tRNA gene sequences and secondary structure	Fringillidae is a large and diverse family of Passeriformes. So far, however, Fringillidae relationships deduced from morphological features and by a number of molecular approaches have remained unproven. Recently, much attention has been attracted to mitochondrial tRNA genes, whose sequence and secondary structural characteristics have shown to be useful for Acrodont Lizards and deep-branch phylogenetic studies. In order to identify useful phylogenetic markers and test Fringillidae relationships, we have sequenced three major clusters of mitochondrial tRNA genes from 15 Fringillidae taxa. A coincident tree, with coturnix as outgroup, was obtained through Maximum-likelihood method using combined dataset of 11 mitochondrial tRNA gene sequences. The result was similar to that through Neighbor-joining but different from Maximum-parsimony methods. Phylogenetic trees constructed with stem-region sequences of 11 genes had many different topologies and lower confidence than with total sequences. On the other hand, some secondary structural characteristics may provide phylogenetic information on relatively short internal branches at under-genus level. In summary, our data indicate that mitochondrial tRNA genes can achieve high confidence on Fringillidae phylogeny at subfamily level, and stem-region sequences may be suitable only at above-family level. Secondary structural characteristics may also be useful to resolve phylogenetic relationship between different genera of Fringillidae with good performance. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

33750933270	Comparative Analysis of Complete Mitochondrial DNA Control Region of Four Species of Strigiformes	The sequence of the whole mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region (CR) of four species of Strigiformes was obtained. Length of the CR was 3 290 bp, 2 848 bp, 2 444 bp, and 1 771 bp for Asio flammeus, Asio otus, Athene noctua, and Strix aluco, respectively. Interestingly, the length of the control region was maximum in Asio flammeus among all the avian mtDNA control regions sequenced thus far. In addition, the base composition and organization of mtDNA CR of Asio flammeus were identical to those reported for other birds. On the basis of the differential frequencies of base substitutions, the CR may be divided two variable domains, I and III, and a central conserved domain, II. The 3′ end of the CR contained many tandem repeats of varying lengths and repeat numbers. In Asio flammeus, the repeated sequences consisted of a 126 bp sequence that was repeated seven times and a 78 bp sequence that was repeated 14 times. In Asio otus, there were also two repeated sequences, namely a 127 bp sequence that was repeated eight times and a 78 bp sequence that was repeated six times. The control region of Athene noctua contained three sets of repeats: a 89 bp sequence that was repeated three times, a 77 bp sequence that was repeated four times, and a 71 bp sequence that was repeated six times. Strix aluco, however, had only one repeated sequence, a 78 bp sequence that was repeated five times. The results of this study seem to indicate that these tandem repeats may have resulted from slipped-strand mispairing during mtDNA replication. Moreover, there are many conserved motifs within the repeated units. These sequences could form stable stem-loop secondary structures, which suggests that these repeated sequences play an important role in regulating transcription and replication of the mitochondrial genome. © 2006 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology & The Genetics Society of China.

33947195767	Characterisation of the fibrinogenolytic properties of the buccal gland secretion from Lampetra japonica	Lampetra japonica is representative of the ancient cyclostomota class of animals, and its buccal gland secretion (called lamphredin) is known to act as an anticoagulant. In this study, it was observed by both native-PAGE and SDS-PAGE that the secretion mainly contained two protein bands, buccal gland secretion protein-1 (BGSP-1, 159,909 Da) and buccal gland secretion protein-2 (BGSP-2, 25,660 Da). The N-terminal amino acids of BGSP-1 (EAESF QNLKT RICGG LNGLG) and BGSP-2 (TSVND WKLLD TKLSA NRKVI) were sequenced. Using a Sephadex G-75 column, we isolated BGSP-1, BGSP-2 and small peptides from the buccal gland secretion, but found only BGSP-1 showed fibrinogenolytic activity. BGSP-1 and lamphredin were found to rapidly degrade the alpha chain of human fibrinogen, slowly degrade the beta chain and hardly degrade the gamma chain. BGSP-1 and lamphredin showed a similar map by SDS-PAGE for the degradation of fibrinogen by cleavage at Ala

33847697379	Retained introns increase putative microRNA targets within 3′ UTRs of human mRNA	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNA that post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of target genes by binding to mRNAs. As one form of alternative splicing, intron retention has influence upon mRNA modification and protein encoding. The effect of miRNA on mRNA containing retained intron within 3′ UTR, however, has not been systematically elucidated. Here, we examined a total of 2864 human genes which contain at least one retained intron from the MAASE and ASD databases and found 387 genes having contained retained introns within 3′ UTR. The effect of retained introns upon miRNA targets was explored with three web-based programs for miRNA prediction including miRanda, TargetScanS and PicTar. The results showed that retained introns can increase putative miRNA targets in human mRNA. Retained introns have higher chances than other regions of 3′ UTR in involving the site of miRNAs targets of most genes which contain putative miRNA targets within it. Furthermore, some transcripts contain miRNA targets solely because of the retained introns in 3′ UTR. In addition, we examined those 'Ignored' retained introns by miRanda software and the results indicated that miRNAs may contain many more putative targets. © 2007 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

38049048884	ESTs analyses of Lampetra japonica liver and comparation transcriptome with the jawed vertebrates	A cDNA library was constructed from the liver of Lampetra japonica. 10077 ESTs were obtained by random selecting clones for sequencing. The results demonstrated that 8515 ESTs were assembled into 648 consensus sequences, represented 2210 unique transcripts, 47.06% of which were predicted as full length cDNAs. In addition, 1562 ESTs were singlets. Using the BLAST to align the assembled ESTs, we found that 93.9% (2053) transcripts shared similarity to sequences published in GenBank databases. The functional annotations to assembled ESTs showed that the genes, involved in immunology, blood coagulation and metabolism of jawed vertebrates, were highly expressed in the liver of L. japonica. Furthermore, 8 potential novel genes were identified. Further comparing liver transcriptome of L. japonica with Fundulus heteroclitus, Mus musculus, Bos Taurus, and Homo sapiens revealed that the genes of Chitinase and Polysaccharides metabolism were more highly expressed in L. japonica than the others, which implied that they may play an important role in immunity of L. japonica. In addition, using the TargetScan, we marked microRNA target within 3′ UTR of L. japonica liver transcriptome. The data indicated that some microRNA targets were homology with the targets embeded in human cancer genes. The result seems to provide a useful clue to the treatment of human cancer. Therefore, the present work will be an important resource for investigating the functional genomics and proteomics of L. japonica as well as evolution of vertebrates. © 2008 Science in China Press.

38349076324	Phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate kininogen genes	Kininogens, the precursors of bradykinins, vary extremely in both structure and function among different taxa of animals, in particular between mammals and amphibians. This includes even the most conserved bradykinin domain in terms of biosynthesis mode and structure. To elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of kininogen genes, we have identified 19 novel amino acid sequences from EST and genomic databases (for mammals, birds, and fishes) and explored their phylogenetic relationships using combined amino acid sequence and gene structure as markers. Our results show that there were initially two paralogous kininogen genes in vertebrates. During their evolution, the original gene was saved with frequent multiplication in amphibians, but lost in fishes, birds, and mammals, while the novel gene was saved with multiple functions in fishes, birds, and mammals, but became a pseudogene in amphibians. We also propose that the defense mechanism against specific predators in amphibian skin secretions has been bradykinin receptor dependent. Our findings may provide a foundation for identification and structural, functional, and evolutionary analyses of more kininogen genes and other gene families. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

77954535612	A novel CD29-like protein expressed in Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum) and involved in immune response	CD29 is the integrin beta1 subunit. Integrin family members are membrane receptors involved in cell adhesion and recognition in a variety of processes including embryogenesis, tissue repair and immune response. In this study, a novel CD29-like gene (LCD29) was identified and characterized in Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum), an agnathan that occupies a critical phylogenic position between cephalochordates and gnathostomes. After a partial cDNA sequence of LCD29 was found from the leucocyte cDNA library, the full-length cDNA was obtained by means of 3' and 5' RACE, respectively. LCD29 encodes 780 amino acids and shares high sequence homology with other vertebrates. Both real-time PCR and immunohistochemical assays have demonstrated the wide distribution of the LCD29 in lamprey tissues, and FACS analysis has shown that the expression level of this protein is higher in granulocytes than in lymphocytes. Furthermore, after the lampreys were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, the levels of LCD29 mRNA were obviously up-regulated in the leucocytes, intestine, heart and gill tissues. Most importantly, an interaction between LCD29 and LCD9 in the intestine has been found with co-immunoprecipitation assays for the first time. The results obtained in the present study will help us to understand the function of LCD29 in immune response in jawless vertebrates. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

43549102225	Phylogenetic analysis of 48 gene families revealing relationships between Hagfishes, Lampreys, and Gnathostomata	It has become clear that the extant vertebrates are divided into three major groups, that is, hagfishes, lampreys, and jawed vertebrates. Morphological and molecular studies, however, have resulted in conflicting views with regard to their interrelationships. To clarify the phylogenetic relationships between them, 48 orthologous protein-coding gene families were analyzed. Even as the analysis of 34 nuclear gene families supported the monophyly of cyclostomes, the analysis of 14 mitochondrial gene families suggested a closer relationship between lampreys and gnathostomes compared to hagfishes. Lampreys were sister group of gnathostomes. The results of this study supported the cyclostomes. Choice of outgroup, tree-making methods, and software may affect the phylogenetic prediction, which may have caused much debate over the subject. Development of new methods for tackling such problems is still necessary. © 2008 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.

49449094278	Comparative analysis of mitochondrial fragments transferred to the nucleus in vertebrate	Mitochondrial DNA sequences transferred to the nucleus give rise to the socalled nuclear mitochondrial DNA (numt). In the GenBank database, 244 numts have been found in six orders of birds (Anseriformes, Columbiformes, Falconiformes, Charadriiformes, Galliformes and Passeriformes). Sequences alignment (NCBI-BLASTN) was carried out with mitochondrial and corresponding nuclear genome sequences in nine vertebrate species. The sequences with high homology were considered as numts. The number of numts ranged from 15 in chicken to 159 in chimpanzee. The sequences of numts in macaque, chimpanzee, and human spanned 100% of the entire mammalian mitochondrial genome. The reconstructed frequency of the mitochondrial gene transferred to the nucleus demonstrated that the rRNA genes had high frequencies than other mitochondrial genes. Using the RepeatMasker program, the transposable elements were detected in the flanking regions of each numt. The results showed that less than 5% of the flanking sequences were made up of repetitive elements in chicken. The GC content of 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of numts in nine species was less than 44%. The analysis of the flanking sequences provided a valuable understanding for future study on mechanism of mitochondrial gene transfer to the nucleus and the site of numt integration. © 2008 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.

54849413348	Identification and characterization of a chitinase-coding gene from Lamprey (Lampetra japonica) with a role in gonadal development and innate immunity	Chitinases (E.3.2.1.14) are ubiquitous hydrolases capable of cleaving the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in chitin polymers. The physiological significance of these enzymes in the development and immunity of various animals has recently been reported [Badariotti F, Thuau R, Lelong C, Dubos MP, Favrel P. Characterization of an atypical family 18 chitinase from the oyster Crassostrea gigas: evidence for a role in early development and immunity. Dev Comp Immunol 2007;31(6):559-70]. Lampreys are regarded as the most phylogenetically primitive species that may have an adaptive immune system. However, no chitinase gene has yet been identified in lamprey. We report here the identification and characterization of a chitinase-coding gene from the lamprey Lampetra japonica. The predicted amino acid sequence of the chitinase gene consisted of a typical catalytic domain and a peritrophin-A type chitin-binding domain. Real time RT-PCR analysis showed that the chitinase gene was expressed in various tissues of adult L. japonica, particularly in the liver, where a significant difference between male and female was observed during the pre-spawning period. A significant increase in expression was also observed in vivo following stimulation by bacteria or fungi. These findings seemed to suggest that in L. japonica, chitinase probably plays an important role in gonadal development as well as in innate immunity in response to invasion by microorganisms. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

55349136212	Novel translationally controlled tumor protein homologue in the buccal gland secretion of Lampetra japonica	We have cloned a homologue of the translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) from the buccal gland of Lampetra japonica according to information from a cDNA library and primary analysis of expressed sequence tags. Sequence analysis of L. japonica TCTP showed that it had two signature regions of high sequence homology termed TCTP-1 and TCTP-2, respectively. TCTP is highly conserved in evolution. It showed more than 40% identification similarities with parasite TCTPs that had effect on immune responses of host. Phylogeny of 31 TCTP sequences showed that lamprey was closer to jawed vertebrates than to Amphioxus and was a sister group of gnathostomes. TCTP gene from L. japonica was expressed in a pET23b vector and purified by using His Bind affinity chromatography. Polyclonal antibody to recombinant protein was generated in New Zealand Rabbit. Immunoblot analysis to localize the recombinant protein in buccal gland secretion proves that recombinant TCTP is a secretion protein, which may be secreted through a non-classical secretion pathway. A characterization study shows that recombinant TCTP has histamine-releasing function in vitro. It mediated histamine release from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. TCTP links both the innate and the adaptive immune responses by modulating the secretion of cytokines from mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and T and B lymphocytes. These may indicate a potential role of TCTP in the inflammatory process and immune regulation between L. japonica and host. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

59849100564	Cloning of the kininogen gene from Lampetra japonica provides insights into its phylogeny in vertebrates	Kininogens, the precursors of bradykinins, ubiquitously exist in vertebrates, including mammals, birds, amphibians, and fishes. To elucidate the phylogeny of kininogen genes in early vertebrates, we cloned the full-length cDNA of kininogen gene from the liver of Lampetra japonica. The open reading frame of this sequence contained 546 bp and encoded 181 amino acids, including a cystatin domain without the canonical binding site for cysteine proteinases and a bradykinin domain. Our results suggested that in lampreys and most of other vertebrates, there might be only one kininogen gene, which was fused by certain sequences during vertebrate evolution and encoded proteins with more functions; however, another special kininogen gene, only encoding the bradykinin domain with multiple copies in some species, arose only in amphibians for adapting themselves to the unique environment. Using reverse transcription PCR, kininogen mRNA was also detected in lamprey gut, kidney, and leukocyte, but absent in lamprey buccal gland. Our findings may provide insights into the phylogeny of kininogen genes as well as other gene families in vertebrates. © 2009 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.

65349119596	Success of Murine embryo transfer increased by a modified transfer pipette	Embryos transfer is one of the most critical steps for generating genetically modified mice. Because of the limitations of the current transfer equipment and techniques, such as discharge of freshly transferred embryos and the necessity of sophisticated transfer skills, the success ratio of implantation may not well satisfy the requirements for mass production of high quality animals in the field of genetically modified mice. In this study, we describe a modified embryo transfer pipette with a syringe-like tip that can easily be applied to mouse embryo transfer. Using this improved method, we show that the procedures for mouse embryo implantation are simplified and easier to perform; moreover, the viability rate of mouse embryos is 20% higher than that achieved with conventional methods. Our modified tool and improved transfer technique are effective, time-saving and less invasive, resulting in increased success of embryo transfer.

67649518886	Suppression of neuronal excitability by the secretion of the lamprey (Lampetra japonica) provides a mechanism for its evolutionary stability	Lampreys are one of the most primitive vertebrates still living today. They attach themselves to the body surface of the host fish through their sucker-like mouths and suck blood of the host for days. Recent fossil evidence has indicated that morphology of lampreys in the late Devonian period, over 360 million years ago, already possessed the present day major characteristics, suggesting the evolutionary stability of a highly specialized parasitic feeding habit. Obviously, nociceptive responses and hemostasis of the host are two major barriers to long-term feeding of the parasitic lamprey. It has been found, to counteract hemostasis of the host, that paired buccal glands of lampreys secrete antihemostatic compounds to prevent blood of the host from coagulation. However, it is not known how lampreys make the host lose nociceptive responses. Here, we prepared components of the crude extract from the buccal glands of the lampreys (Lampetra japonica). Then, we show that crude extract and one of its purified components reduce the firing frequency of neuronal action potentials probably through inhibiting the voltage-dependent Na

73449131230	Overexpression of FoxO1 causes proliferation of cultured pancreatic β cells exposed to low nutrition	Multiple lines of evidence have shown that the functional defect of pancreatic β cells is the root cause of type 2 diabetes. FoxO1, a key transcription factor of fundamental cellular physiology and functions, has been implicated in this process. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still largely unknown. Here, we show that the overexpression of FoxO1 promotes the proliferation of cultured pancreatic β cells exposed to low nutrition, while no change in apoptosis was observed compared with the control group. Moreover, by using two specific inhibitors for PI3K andMAPK signaling, we found that FoxO1 might be the downstream transcription factor of these two pathways. Furthermore, a luciferase assay demonstrated that FoxO1 could regulate the expression of Ccnd1 at the transcription level. Collectively, our findings indicated that FoxO1 modulated by both MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways was prone to cause the proliferation, but not the apoptosis, of pancreatic β cells exposed to low nutrition, at least partially, by regulating the expression of Ccnd1 at the transcription level. ©2009 American Chemical Society.

7444261392	Phylogenetic relationships within mammalian order Carnivora indicated by sequences of two nuclear DNA genes	Phylogenetic relationships among 37 living species of order Carnivora spanning a relatively broad range of divergence times and taxonomic levels were examined using nuclear sequence data from exon 1 of the IRBP gene (≈1.3 kb) and first intron of the TTR gene (≈1 kb). These data were used to analyze carnivoran phylogeny at the family and generic level as well as the interspecific relationships within recently derived Felidae. Phylogenetic results using a combined IRBP + TTR dataset strongly supported within the superfamily Califormia, the red panda as the closest lineage to procyonid-mustelid (i.e., Musteloidea) clade followed by pinnipeds (Otariidae and Phocidae), Ursidae (including the giant panda), and Canidae. Four feliform families, namely the monophyletic Herpestidae, Hyaenidae, and Felidae, as well as the paraphyletic Viverridae were consistently recovered convincingly. The utilities of these two gene segments for the phylogenetic analyses were extensively explored and both were found to be fairly informative for higher-group associations within the order Carnivora, but not for those of low level divergence at the species level. Therefore, there is a need to find additional genetic markers with more rapid mutation rates that would be diagnostic at deciphering relatively recent relationships within the Carnivora. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

77952290935	Overexpression of Trpp5 contributes to cell proliferation and apoptosis probably through involving calcium homeostasis	Trpp5 is one member of the polycystic kidney disease (PKD) family, which belongs to transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily. Our previous study has shown that Trpp5 is developmentally expressed in mouse testis and overexpression of Trpp5 increases intracellular free calcium concentration in MDCK cells. However, the roles of this protein in cellular processes are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that Trpp5 resided in both cytoplasm and cell membrane of HEK293 cells. We found that overexpression of Trpp5 slightly increased the calcium current amplitude of HEK293 cells and shifted the reversal potential to a more negative value. Meanwhile, overexpression of Trpp5 suppressed proliferation of Hela cells via inhibiting DNA replication and induced apoptosis of Hela cells with morphological changes and accumulation of fragmented DNA. Collectively, these findings suggest that Trpp5 might involve calcium homeostasis contributing to cell proliferation and apoptosis. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

77955654013	MicroRNA-17 post-transcriptionally regulates polycystic kidney disease-2 gene and promotes cell proliferation	To identify the possible microRNAs (miRNAs) which target the polycystic kidney disease-2 gene (PKD2), and clarify effects of the miRNAs on PKD2. We preliminarily used bioinformatics to analyze 3′UTR (3′untranslated regions) of PKD1 and PKD2 in order to predict the potential microRNAs targeted on them. Subsequently, the stable cell lines with overexpression of microRNA-17 (miR-17) were screened, and luciferase assay combined with the mutation 3′UTR of PKD2 were performed to verify PKD2 is the target of miR-17. Moreover, RT-PCR and Western Blotting were used to determine the post-transcriptionally regulation of PKD2 by miR-17. Finally, MTT cell assays allied with PKD2 rescued strategy were employed to evaluate cell proliferation effects. Our study firstly found that the 3′UTR of PKD2 was more conservation than that of PKD1, and microRNA-17 directly targets the 3′UTR of PKD2 and post-transcriptionally repress the expression of PKD2. Moreover, our findings also demonstrated that overexpression of miR-17 may promote cell proliferation via post-transcriptionally repression of PKD2 in HEK 293T. This suggested that microRNA might be a novel mechanism for cystogenesis as well as a potential therapeutic target for the cell proliferation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

77955656423	Down-regulation of Pkd2 by siRNAs suppresses cell-cell adhesion in the mouse melanoma cells	The Pkd2 gene encodes an integral protein (~130 kDa), named polycystin-2 (PC-2). PC-2 is mainly involved in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Recently, polycystin-1/polycystin-2 complex has been shown to act as an adhesion complex mediating or regulating cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion, suggesting that PC-2 may play a role in cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions. Here, we knocked down the expression of Pkd2 gene with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in the mouse melanoma cells (B16 cells), indicating that the cells transfected with the targeted siRNAs significantly suppressed cell-cell adhesion, but not cell-matrix adhesion, compared to the cells transfected with non-targeted control (NC) siRNA. This study provides the first directly functional evidence that PC-2 mediates cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PC-2 modulated cell-cell adhesion may be, at least partially, associated with E-cadherin. Collectively, these findings for the first time showed that PC-2 may mediate cell-cell adhesion, at least partially, through E-cadherin. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

77957115272	A novel RGD-toxin protein, Lj-RGD3, from the buccal gland secretion of Lampetra japonica impacts diverse biological activities	RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif toxin proteins from snake venoms, saliva glands secretion of leech or tick have typical characteristics of inhibiting platelet aggregation, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. Here we report cloning and characterization of a novel RGD-toxin protein from the buccal gland of Lampetra japonica. In an attempt to study the activities of anticoagulant in the buccal gland secretion of L. japonica, we established buccal gland cDNA library and identified a gene encoding a predicted protein of 118 amino acids with 3 RGD motifs. The predicted protein was named Lj-RGD3. We generated the cDNA of Lj-RGD3 and obtained the recombinant protein rLj-RGD3. The polyclonal antibodies against rLj-RGD3 recognized the native Lj-RGD3 protein in buccal gland secretion in Western blot analyses. The biological function studies reveal that rLj-RGD3 inhibited human platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner with IC

79953780417	FLNA and PGK1 are two potential markers for progression in hepatocellular carcinoma	Background/Aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most deadly diseases; metastasis and recurrence are the most important factors that affect the therapy of HCC chronically. Until now, the prognosis for the metastasis of HCC had not improved. Recently, several proteins that are related to metastasis and invasion of HCC were identified, but the effective markers still remain to be elucidated. Methods: In this study, comparative proteomics was used to study the differentially expressed proteins in two HCC cell lines MHCC97L and HCCLM9, which have low and high metastatic potentials, respectively. Results: Our findings indicated that filamin A (FLNA) and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) were two significantly differentially expressed proteins, with high expression in HCCLM9 cells, and may influence the metastasis of HCC cells. Conclusion: Taken together with the confirmation of expression on the mRNA level, we propose the use of FLNA and PGK1 as potential markers for the progression of HCC. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG.

79959406820	Novel neutrophil inhibitory factor homologue in the buccal gland secretion of Lampetra japonica	To identify the functional gene fragment, a neutrophil inhibitory factor (NIF) like protein was found in the buccal gland of Lampetra japonica, suggesting that this related lamprey protein represents a novel class of integrin receptor antagonists. The recombinant Lampetra japonica-NIF like (rLj-NIF) was identified by SDS-PAGE and purified by using His•Bind affinity chromatography. Effect of rLj-NIF on neutrophil migration suggested that rLj-NIF can act as a neutrophil inhibitory factor. Besides that, oxidative burst activity of neutriphil was tested by flow cytometry using dihydrorhodamine (DHR123) as a fluorogenic substrate, and the data suggested that the mean fluorescence intensity significantly decreased compared with positive controls (p<0.01). All above results indicated that rLj-NIF could also prevent the binding of β2 integrins to the surface of PMN and its FITC-labeled monoclonal antibodies (p<0.05). These data suggest that Lampetra japonica-NIF like protein is secreted by the stage of the parasite at the site of attachment. rLj-NIF plays an essential role in physiological reaction of neutrophil by a novel class of β2 integrin receptor antagonists. The activity of immunosuppressant of L. japonica-NIF could have potential medicinal value in anti-inflammation and therapy of autoimmune diseases. © 2011 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.

82555168072	Anti-angiogenic activities of Lj-RGD3 toxin protein from Lampetra japonica and its mutation protein Lj-112 without RGD motifs	Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-toxin protein Lj-RGD3 of Lampetra japonica shares homologous with a Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), and both RGD-toxin protein and HRG have antiangiogenic activities with different targets. To study the relationship between the function and the structure of Lj-RGD3, we studied the anti-angiogenic characteristics of both Lj-RGD3 and the mutation named Lj-112 of which three RGD motifs of Lj-RGD3 were deleted. We synthesized the gene of Lj-112, constructed it to the plasmid pET23b, and expressed the recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli BL21. Both recombinant proteins with the C-terminal his-tag were 15 kDa soluble proteins. Then we purified rLj-RGD3 and rLj-112 using the His-Bind affinity chromatography. To examine the effect of both proteins on bFGF-induced proliferation of ECV304 cell, we carried out the 3-(4, 5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3, 5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) assays. For cell migration and invasion assays, we used Transwell containing insert filter and Matrigel to imitate the in vivo environment. To examine whether both proteins were capable of interrupting the angiogenesis in vivo, we used the chick chicken embryonic chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) as an angiogenesis model. We used Integrin-linked kinase1 (ILK1) ELISA method to study functionary mechanisms of rLj-RGD3 and rLj-112. Both rLj-RGD3 and rLj-112 inhibited bFGF-induced proliferation of ECV304 cells in a dose-dependent manner with IC

84860364663	Identification and characterization of the lamprey high-mobility group box 1 gene	High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a highly conserved DNA-binding protein, plays an important role in maintaining nucleosome structures, transcription, and inflammation. We identified a homolog of HMGB1 in the Japanese lamprey (Lampetra japonica). The Lampetra japonica HMGB1 gene (Lj-HMGB1) has over 70% sequence identity with its homologs in jawed vertebrates. Despite the reasonably high sequence identity with other HMGB1 proteins, Lj-HMGB1 did not group together with these proteins in a phylogenetic analysis. We examined Lj-HMGB1 expression in lymphocyte-like cells, and the kidneys, heart, gills, and intestines of lampreys before and after the animals were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and concanavalin A (ConA). Lj-HMGB1 was initially expressed at a higher level in the heart, but after treatment with LPS and ConA only the gills demonstrated a significant up-regulation of expression. The recombinant Lj-HMGB1 (rLj-HMGB1) protein bound double-stranded DNA and induced the proliferation of human adenocarcinoma cells to a similar extent as human HMGB1. We further revealed that Lj-HMGB1 was able to induce the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a pro-inflammatory mediator, in activated human acute monocytic leukemia cells. These results suggest that lampreys use HMGB1 to activate their innate immunity for the purpose of pathogen defense. © 2012 Pang et al.

84860437015	Effects of the recombinant toxin protein rLj-RGD3 in multidrug-resistant human breast carcinoma cells	We have previously reported that Lj-RGD3, a novel RGD-toxin protein, was isolated from the buccal gland of Lampetra japonica. The recombinant protein rLj-RGD3 has anti-invasive and anti-adhesive activity in tumor cells (HeLa cells) and endothelial cells (ECV304 cells) in vitro, and inhibits αvβ3, αvβ5, and β1 integrin-mediated adhesion. In this study, we investigated the bioactivity of rLj-RGD3 in the drug-resistant MCF-7/Adr breast carcinoma cell line and drug-sensitive parental line MCF-7, and found that rLj-RGD3 inhibited the growth of both cell lines. Biological function studies revealed that rLj-RGD3 could induce the apoptosis in MCF-7/Adr, which was more prevalent than that in the drug-sensitive parental line MCF-7. In addition, rLj-RGD3 inhibited the adhesion of MCF-7/Adr cells to fibronectin. Furthermore, rLj-RGD3 prevented invasion of MCF-7/Adr cells through an artificial matrigel basement membrane. In summary, rLj-RGD3 may be used as a potential drug in multidrug-resistant breast cancer therapy. © 2012 The Author.

84862766895	Genetic variants of the MRC1 gene and the IFNG gene are associated with leprosy in Han Chinese from Southwest China	Leprosy is an ancient infectious disease, with over 200,000 affected people (mainly in Asia and Africa) being registered annually. Genetic factors may confer susceptibility to this disease. In the present study, we genotyped 12 genetic variants of the MRC1 gene and the IFNG gene in 527 Han Chinese with leprosy and 583 healthy individuals from Yunnan, China, to discern potential association of these two genes with leprosy. In particular, we aimed to validate the recently reported association of MRC1 variant rs1926736 (p.G396S) and IFNG variant rs2430561 (+874 T>A) with leprosy, which were initially observed in Vietnamese and Brazilian populations, respectively. Our results failed to confirm the reported association between variants rs1926736 and rs2430561 and leprosy in Han Chinese. However, we found that variants rs692527 (P = 0.022) and rs34856358 (P = 0.022) of the MRC1 gene were associated with paucibacillary leprosy, and rs3138557 of the IFNG gene was significantly associated with multibacillary leprosy. The exact role of the MRC1 gene and the IFNG gene in leprosy awaits future study. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84863312123	PKHD1 post-transcriptionally modulated by miR-365-1 inhibits cell-cell adhesion	Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a severe inherited disorder with an incidence of 1/20000 live births. Mutations of PKHD1 (polycystic kidney and hepatic disease gene 1) gene were identified to be responsible for ARPKD. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small RNAs with global effect on gene expression. Up to 30% of human protein coding genes may be regulated by miRNAs. However, to date, nothing is known regarding the role of miRNAs in PKHD1. In this study, we exploited bioinformatics to analyse the 3'UTR of PKHD1 gene and illustrated that the 3'UTR region of the gene is highly conserved in evolution. We identified about 35 candidate miRNAs within a 3738bp window of the 3'UTR region. Of the 35 potential miRNAs, miR-365-1 emerged to post-transcriptionally modulate the expression of PKHD1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-365-1 modulated PKHD1 suppressed cell-cell adhesion in part through E-cadherin. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84864123670	A novel BTK-like protein involved in immune response in Lethenteron japonicum	Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) plays an important role in the development, differentiation and signal transduction of B-lymphocyte. Lymphocyte-like cells and unique variable lymphocyte receptors have been found in the Japanese lamprey . Lethenteron japonicum, an agnatha known to be lacking T or B lymphocyte, and the oldest agantha in existence. In this study a . BTK-like gene from . L. japonicum was identified and characterized. It contained a 1992-bp open reading frame (ORF), a 157-bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and a 567-bp 3'-UTR. Phylogenetic analysis indicated it had high sequence homology with BTKs from other vertebrates. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the transcript of the . L. japonicum BTK-like gene was distributed in various immune associated tissues, and the level of which was upregulated in leukocytes after the animal was stimulated with LPS. This observation was further confirmed by FACS and western blot analyses. These results indicated that the . BTK-like gene identified in . L. japonicum may play an important role in the immune response of lamprey. © 2012.

84865341016	Characterization, phylogenetic analysis and cDNA cloning of natterin-like gene from the blood of lamprey, Lampetra japonica	Lamprey as a "living fossil" of immunological origin and "rich treasure" of biological pharmaceutical development has caused attention of scholars. The cDNA library construction and EST sequencing of blood had been done previously in our lab, and bioinformatics analysis provided a gene fragment which is highly homologous with natterin family, named natterin-like. To elucidate the characterization and phylogeny of natterin-like genes in early evolution, we cloned the full-length cDNA of natterin-like gene from the blood of Lampetra japonica. The open reading frame of this sequence contained 942. bp and encoded 313 amino acids, including a lectin-like domain and a pore-forming toxin-like domain. Using reverse transcription PCR, natterin-like mRNA was also detected in lamprey blood, kidney, heart, liver, medullary, gonad, but absent in lamprey intestine and gill. Our results suggested that in lampreys and most of other species, there might be only one natterin-like gene, which was fused by certain sequences during evolution and encoded proteins with more functions. It is similar between C terminal of natterin-like protein and Aerolysin in space structure and the lectin-like domain of natterin-like equivalent to glycoprotein binding motif of Aerolysin in function. We also propose that the defense mechanism against specific predators in historical evolution of lamprey. Our findings may provide insights into the function and characterization of natterin-like genes as well as other gene families in vertebrates and provide a foundation for identification and structural, functional, and evolutionary analyses of more natterin-like genes and other gene families. © 2012.

84865400242	Comparative proteomic analysis suggests that mitochondria are involved in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease	Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), characterized by ectatic collecting duct, is an infantile form of PKD occurring in 1 in 20 000 births. Despite having been studied for many years, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In the current study, we employed, for the first time, a MS-based comparative proteomics approach to investigate the differently expressed proteins between kidney tissue samples of four ARPKD and five control individuals. Thirty two differently expressed proteins were identified and six of the identified protein encoding genes performed on an independent group (three ARPKD subjects, four control subjects) were verified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and part of them were further validated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Moreover, similar alteration tendency was detected after downregulation of PKHD1 by small interfering RNA in HEK293T cell. Interestingly, most of the identified proteins are associated with mitochondria. This implies that mitochondria may be implicated in ARPKD. Furthermore, the String software was utilized to investigate the biological association network, which is based on known and predicted protein interactions. In conclusion, our findings depicted a global understanding of ARPKD progression and provided a promising resource of targeting protein, and shed some light further investigation of ARPKD. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

0038823789	Sequence variation of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and phylogenetic relationships among twelve species of charadriiformes	Studies of the phylogenetic relationships of the Charadriiformes have been largely based on conservative morphological characters. During the past 10 years, many studies on the evolutionary biology of birds adopted phylogenetic information obtained from mitochondrial DNA, but few work on the Charadriiformes has been reported to date. Therefore, phylogenetic relationships and classification of the Charadriiformes remains controversial. In this study, we try to shed light on these relationships via DNA sequence analysis of the mitochondrial Cyt b gene in 12 species of Charadriiformes. It was a preliminary study of the origin and evolution of the species by using nucleotide sequence data. Using the well-known PCR techniques, the complete mitochondrial Cyt b gene sequences were amplified and sequenced respectively from Charadrius mongolus, Charadrius alexandrinus, Numenius madagascariensis, Numenius arquat, Numenius phaeopus, Tringa totanus, Tringa glareola, Xenus cineres, Arenaria interpres, Calidris tenuirostris, Recurvirostra avosetts and Haematopus ostralensis. The 1143 bp long DNA sequences of the gene from these species were obtained, in which 381 variable sites were identified without insertions or deletions. The nucleic acid sequence variation of the mitochondrial Cyt b gene was 5.16%-16.01% among these species. Phylogenetic trees constructed using the NJ method, MP method and ML mothod with Ciconia ciconia as the outgroup indicate that the 12 species of Charadriiformes examined in this study are clustered in two major clades. The first clade includes T. totanus, T. glareola, A. interpres, C. tenuirostris, X. cineres, N. madagascariensis, N. arquata and N. phaeopus. The second one includes C. mongolus, C. alexandrinus, R. avosetts and H. ostralensis. Our molecular data show that the phylogenetic relationships among species of Scolopacidae are consistent with the classification based on morphological studies; R. avosetts and H. ostralensis are relatively closer, and form a sister group, and then form paraphyletic group with a sister group which comprised of C. mongolus and C. alexandrinus. The results support Sibley's opinion of assigning R. avosetts and H. ostralensis which form Recurvirostrinae as a taxon of the Charadriidae, and the Charadriidae dividing into two subfamilies: Recurvirostrinae and Charadriinae respectively.

84871458477	Preparation method of lamprey antisera and activity assay	Lampreys, the surviving representative of jawless vertebrates, have been a focal point in the search for the evolutionary origin of adaptive immunity. They have independently evolved the variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR)-based adaptive immune system that protects themselves from infection by a variable of microorganisms. The standard immunization schedule for Japanese lamprey (. Lampetra japonica) was established to prepare antisera by injection of Escherichia coli, Bacillus proteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, RRBCs, SRBCs, NB4 cells and Hela cells. In this study, we demonstrated the activities of lamprey antisera, which might be helpful to research the collaboration between VLR-based adaptive immune system and complement system in jawless vertebrates. © 2012.

84872705891	Lamprey variable lymphocyte receptors mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity	An alternative adaptive-immune system is present in the most basal vertebrates-lampreys and hagfish-the only surviving jawless vertebrates. These eel-like fish use leucine-rich repeat-based receptors for Ag recognition instead of the Ig-based receptors used in jawed vertebrates. We report that in Japanese lamprey (Lampetra japonica), variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR)B interacts with C1q and C3 proteins to mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity for bacteria and tumor cells. The immunebased lysis involves deposition of VLRB and C1q-like protein complex on the surface of target cells, activation of C3, and ultimate disruption of cell wall integrity. The demonstration of functional interaction between VLRB and complement components in lamprey provides evidence for the emergence of cooperative innate and adaptive-immune responses at a pivotal point in vertebrate evolution, before or in parallel with the evolution of Ig-based Abs and the classical complement-activation pathway.

84879216925	Low concentrations of the recombinant toxin protein rLj-RGD3 suppress TNF-α-induced human renal carcinoma cell invasion	A hallmark of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) invasion is the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by the local production of gelatinase enzymes. Matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP-9)-induced cancer cell invasion is one of the pivotal steps in cancer metastasis. It has been reported that tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-α), a regulator of MMP-9, can induce invasion in human renal carcinoma cells. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that rLj-RGD3, a recombinant RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-toxin protein from the buccal gland secretion of Lampetra japonica, possesses anti-tumor activity. In this study, we demonstrated that rLj-RGD3 suppressed TNF-α-induced MMP-9 secretion in 786-0 cells (human renal carcinoma cells). To investigate the regulatory effect of rLj-RGD3 on TNF-α-induced MMP-9 secretion, we pre-treated cells with rLj-RGD3. Interestingly, rLj-RGD3 had no significant effect on the constitutive secretion of MMPs. However, low concentrations of rLj-RGD3 decreased TNF-α-induced MMP-9 secretion. Functional studies revealed that rLj-RGD3 induced apoptosis and significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of 786-0 cells. Furthermore, the actin architecture in cells pre-treated with rLj-RGD3 was aggregated and disorganized. Our findings suggest that rLj-RGD3 may be used as a potential drug in renal cancer therapy. © The Author 2013.

84880040212	Identification and characterisation of ROS modulator 1 in Lampetra japonica	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a heterogeneous group of highly reactive molecules that oxidise targets in biological systems. ROS are also considered important immune regulators. In this study, we identified a homologue of reactive oxygen species modulator 1 (Romo1) in the Japanese lamprey (Lampetra japonica). The Ljaponica Romo1 (Lj-Romo1) gene shares high sequence homology with the Romo1 genes of jawed vertebrates. Real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated the wide distribution of Lj-Romo1 in lamprey tissues. Furthermore, after the lampreys were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the level of Lj-Romo1 mRNA was markedly up-regulated in the liver, gill, kidney, and intestine tissues. Lj-Romo1 was localised to the mitochondria and has the capacity to increase the ROS level in cells. The results obtained in the present study will help us to understand the roles of Romo1 in ROS production and innate immune responses in jawless vertebrates. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84881307558	Detection of the single-chain precursor in the production and purification process of recombinant human insulin	High quality recombinant insulin requires being free of single-chain precursor (proinsulin), a task that depends on the selectivity and sensitivity of the monitoring process for detecting proinsulin. In this study we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system that was specifically tailored to detect recombinant proinsulin. The proinsulin consists of six components: an initiating methionine, 48 amino acids from human growth hormones (HGH, used as the protection peptide), first connecting Arg-residue, B-chain of insulin, and second connecting Arg-peptide and A-chain of insulin. This form of proinsulin is more stable and can be efficiently expressed by E. coli than insulin. Herein, we evaluated the specificity, precision, recovery, sensitivity, and detection range of the proinsulin ELISA kit. The results showed that the ELISA kit is a very useful tool for monitoring the proinsulin yield in early stages of insulin production as well as the residual proinsulin in the final product, insulin. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.

84883404691	First evidence of protein G-binding protein in the most primitive vertebrate: Serum lectin from lamprey (Lampetra japonica)	The intelectins, a recently identified subgroup of extracellular animal lectins, are glycan-binding receptors that recognize glycan epitopes on foreign pathogens in host systems. Here, we have described NPGBP (novel protein G-binding protein), a novel serum lectin found in the lamprey, Lampetra japonica. RT-PCR yielded a 1005. bp cDNA sequence from the lamprey liver encoding a 334 amino acid secretory protein with homology to mammalian and aquatic organism intelectins. Gene expression analyses showed that the NPGBP gene was expressed in the blood, intestines, kidney, heart, gill, liver, adipose tissue and gonads. NPGBP was isolated by protein G-conjugated agarose immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE analyses showed that NPGBP migrated as a specific band (~35 and ~124. kDa under reducing and non-reducing conditions, respectively). These results suggested that NPGBP forms monomers and tetramers. NPGBP gene expression was induced by in vivo bacterial stimulation, and NPGBP showed different agglutination activities against pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. The induction of NPGBP suggested that it plays an important role in defense against microorganisms in the internal circulation system of the lamprey. When incubated with an unrelated antibody, the specific binding between NPGBP and protein G was competitively inhibited, indicating that NPGBP and the Fc region of Ig bind to the same site on protein G. We thus assume that the tertiary structure of NPGBP is similar to that of the Fc region of Ig. Additionally, NPGBP can effectively promote endothelial cell mitosis. These findings suggest that NPGBP plays a role in the immune defense against microorganisms, and this study represents one of the few examples of the characterization and functional analysis of an aquatic organism intelectin. © 2013.

84883556865	Identification and characterization of a novel IκB-e{open}-like gene from Lamprey (Lampetra japonica) with a role in immune response	Nuclear factor of kappa B (NF-κB) is a stimuli-activated transcription factor, regulates the expression of a diverse array of genes. Inhibitor of kappa B-epsilon (IκB-e{open}) is an inhibitor of NF-κB, which retains NF-κB in an inactive state in the cytoplasm. Lampreys ( Lampetra japonica) belong to the lowest class of vertebrates with little information about its IκBs. We have identified a cDNA sequence IκB-e{open}-like in the lamprey and the deduced amino acid sequence of IκB-e{open}-like. It contains a conserved DSGxxS motif and six consecutive ankyrin repeats, which are necessary for signal-induced degradation of the molecule. Phylogenetic analysis indicated it had high sequence homology with IκB-e{open}s from other vertebrates. FACS analysis showed that IκB-e{open}-like located in cytoplasm of leukocytes. The degradation of IκB-e{open}-like could be observed in leukocytes of L. japonica stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. These results indicate that IκB-e{open} proteins are conserved across vertebrates and the NF-κB-like signaling pathway may exist in the oldest agnatha. © 2013 .

84895864245	Cloning and expression analysis of a novel high-mobility group box 2 homologue from Lampetra japonica	High-mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) is a nonhistone architectural protein that plays important roles in many biological processes. In this study, we cloned a homologue of the HMGB2 from the lymphocyte-like cells of Lampetra japonica (L. japonica). Sequence analysis reveals that L. japonica HMGB2 contains two highly conserved motifs and shares more than 70 % identity with the homologues from other vertebrate species. Subsequently, Lj-HMGB2 was subcloned into the pET-28a(+) and pIRES2 AcGFP1-Nuc vector and expressed in Rosetta blue (DE3) and Hela cell lines, respectively. The recombinant L. japonica HMGB2 (rLj-HMGB2) with apparent molecular mass of 22 kDa was further purified by His-Bind affinity chromatography. Real-time quantitative PCR indicates that the expression level of Lj-HMGB2 was particularly up-regulated in intestines after challenged with lipopolysaccharide, while up-regulated in lymphocyte-like cells and heart after challenged with concanavalin A in vivo. In addition, rLj-HMGB2 could induce the generation of proinflammatory mediators in the activated human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP1), which suggested that Lj-HMGB2 may participate in the immune response of the lampreys. © 2013 The Author(s).

84903907242	Progress in sodium channelopathies and biological functions of voltage-gated sodium channel blockers	Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), which are widely distributed in the excitable cells, are the primary mediators of electrical signal amplification and propagation. They play important roles in the excitative conduction of the neurons and cardiac muscle cells. The abnormalities of the structures and functions of VGSCs can change the excitability of the cells, resulting in a variety of diseases such as neuropathic pain, epilepsy and arrhythmia. At present, some voltage-gated sodium channel blockers are used for treating those diseases. In the recent years, several neurotoxins have been purified from the venom of the animals, which could inhibit the current of the voltage-gated sodium channels. Usually, these neurotoxins are compounds or small peptides that have been further designed and modified for targeted drugs of sodium channelopathies in the clinical treatment. In addition, a novel cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRBGP) has been isolated and purified from the buccal gland of the lampreys (Lampetra japonica), and it could inhibit the Na+ current of the hippocampus and dorsal root neurons for the first time. In the present study, the progress of the sodium channelopathies and the biological functions of voltage-gated sodium channel blockers are analyzed and summarized. © 2014 Chin J Biotech, All rights reserved.

Lj-RGD3 has three RGD motifs and shows homology to histidine-rich glycoprotein.

We investigated the effects of the wild-type and mutated toxins on a gram-positive bacterium (Escherichia coli), a gram-negative bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus), and a fungus (C. albicans). rLj-RGD3 and its mutants exhibited antifungal but not antibacterial activity, as measured by a radial diffusion assay. The C. albicans inhibition zone induced by rLj-112 was larger than that induced by the other proteins, and its inhibitory effect on C. albicans was dose-dependent. In viable-count assays, the rLj-112 MIC was 7.7 μM, whereas the MIC of the positive control (ketoconazole) was 15 μM. Time-kill kinetics demonstrated that rLj-112 effectively killed C. albicans at 1× and 2× MIC within 12 and 6 h, respectively. Electron microscopy analysis showed that rLj-RGD3 and rLj-112 induced C. albicans lysis. Our results demonstrate a novel anticandidal activity for rLj-RGD3 and its mutant derivatives. © 2014 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

84907149936	A functional MiR-124 binding-site polymorphism in IQGAP1 affects human cognitive performance	As a product of the unique evolution of the human brain, human cognitive performance is largely a collection of heritable traits. Rather surprisingly, to date there have been no reported cases to highlight genes that underwent adaptive evolution in humans and which carry polymorphisms that have a marked effect on cognitive performance. IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), a scaffold protein, affects learning and memory in a dose-dependent manner. Its expression is regulated by miR-124 through the binding sites in the 39UTR, where a SNP (rs1042538) exists in the core-binding motif. Here we showed that this SNP can influence the miR-target interaction both in vitro and in vivo. Individuals carrying the derived T alleles have higher IQGAP1 expression in the brain as compared to the ancestral A allele carriers. We observed a significant and male-specific association between rs1042538 and tactile performances in two independent cohorts. Males with the derived allele displayed higher tactual performances as compared to those with the ancestral allele. Furthermore, we found a highly diverged allele-frequency distribution of rs1042538 among world human populations, likely caused by natural selection and/or recent population expansion. These results suggest that current human populations still carry sequence variations that affect cognitive performances and that these genetic variants may likely have been subject to comparatively recent natural selection.
