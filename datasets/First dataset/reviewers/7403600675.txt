1842728332	Relationships of different resolution parameters in geophysical well logging	From the mathematical studies, the conservative relationships of the depth integral areas of the linear well logs and the nonlinear well logs are derived: the depth integral area of a linear well log is not relevant to its vertical resolution, while the depth integral area of a nonlinear well log is closely related to its vertical resolution and the higher the resolution, the bigger the depth integral area. Then, the effects of the mathematical transformations on the above relationships are studied. Finally, the conservative relationships of the shale volume content log and the porosity log are derived for some given conditions.

22544473905	Finite-difference calculation of traveltimes based on rectangular grid	To the most of velocity fields, the traveltimes of the first break that seismic waves propagate along rays can be computed on a 2-D or 3-D numerical grid by finite-difference extrapolation. Under ensuring accuracy, to improve calculating efficiency and adaptability, the calculation method of first-arrival traveltime of finite-difference is derived based on any rectangular grid and a local plane wavefront approximation. In addition, head waves and scattering waves are properly treated and shadow and caustic zones cannot be encountered, which appear in traditional ray-tracing. The testes of two simple models and the complex Marmousi model show that the method has higher accuracy and adaptability to complex structure with strong vertical and lateral velocity variation, and Kirchhoff prestack depth migration based on this method can basically achieve the position imaging effects of wave equation prestack depth migration in major structures and targets. Because of not taking account of the later arrivals energy, the effect of its amplitude preservation is worse than that by wave equation method, but its computing efficiency is higher than that by total Green's function method and wave equation method.

0030149458	Imaging of echo data of submarine sedimentary beds layer-by-layer by using the acoustic-wave equation refraction-correction method	The wide-angle echo data of submarine sedimentary beds are collected by a system composed of a seismic profiler and a hydrophone streamer towed behind the profiler. Usually, the wide-angle echo data are processed with common-depth-point stack method to obtain the stacked section for geological interpretation; but when the acoustic velocity of the sedimentary layers has a lateral variation, the stacked section does not represent the actual structure of sedimentary layers, and from which a false conclusion may be drawn. In case of knowing the acoustic velocity of sedimentary beds, the distortion can be removed by using the acoustic wave equation Kirchhoff integration which continues the wavefields in downgoing and upgoing directions respectively, the accurate image of the structure of submarine sedimentary layers is then obtained.

0030722047	A primary study on an inverse problem for stratified transversely isotropic media	A study is conducted of inversion of elastic parameters in stratified transversely isotropic media with a vertical axis of symmetry (TIV media) by using partial differential system characteristic theory. At first, the characteristic type of plane wave coupled equations are derived from equation of motion and stress-strain relation. Then characteristic line boundary condition expressions (continued situation) are given through methods of singularity analysis and characteristic line integral. These two systems are basic equations for inversion of elastic parameters in stratified smooth media or weakly discontinued TIV media. Besides, wavefield extrapolation formulae and characteristic line boundary condition expressions corresponding to discontinued situation are also attained and can be used for inversion of elastic parameters in stratified TIV media (discontinued situation). At last, it is considered how to reconstruct simultaneously several or six elastic parameters (density and five dependent stiffness coefficients) from multi-wave multi-component seismic data at the surface through analysis of these basic systems.

0031711908	Prestack depth migration by wave equation finite difference	Prestack depth migration is an effective way of imaging complex structures inside the earth. In the paper, it firstly derives common-offset prestack migration wave equation from the prestack reflection ellipse, then by the floating coordinate transform in the reference velocity field, gives prestack depth migration wave equations. When only known wavefields recorded on the surface, the prestack diffraction equation can not be solved because it has second derivative with respect to the term of depth. In order to solve the problem, we use the system of low-order partial differential equations to approximate to upgoing wave and obtain the high-order approximate . equations, create the stationary difference scheme of the high-order approximation equation and the refraction. Finally we apply the technique to process the real data and obtain the satisfactory seismic section.

0032267614	Study of geoacoustic model and acoustic reflection properties of fluid mud layer in Changjiang Estuary and Hangzhou Bay	A generalized geoacoustic model of fluid mud layer in Changjiang Estuary and hangzhou Bay has been derived through a large amount of in-situ measurements of the bulk density (p) of the layers and lab measurements of the acoustic velocity (c) and attenuation coefficient (β) of the fluid mud samples with different values of p for four frequencies of 100, 150, 500, 1500 kHz. The main features of the geoacoustic model can be expressed as follows: in the range of p=10.0-15.0, the bulk density of the fluid mud p increases linearly with depth z, however, there is a gradient change (knee) when p is about 12.5. After p is more than 15.0, the fluid mud is quickly transformed into the ooze layer. In the fluid mud layer, the sound velocity c can be regarded as constant since its variation with z less than 1.5%, and a minimum value exists when p is about 13.5. The variations of β with p and with frequency f are linear. Based on the geoacoustic model and the ray theory, simulations of sound reflection properties of the fluid mud layers have been made, and some significant results have been obtained.

24144490072	An eigenvalue decomposition method to construct absorbing boundary conditions for acoustic and elastic wave equations	A new approach to constructing absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) for acoustic and elastic wave equations (in transversely isotropic media) is presented. The eigenvalue decomposition method (ED method) is used to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix in the wave equations, which can be used to construct the outgoing and incoming waves along any direction. For different boundary regions, the outgoing waves are kept unchanged, but the amplitudes of the incoming waves are kept constant in time. As well as ABCs at the four lines in 2D and six surfaces in 3D, the ABCs at the four corners in 2D and eight corners and 12 lines in 3D are constructed. The vibration curves show that these conditions have nearly the same effect as perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary conditions, and are much better than Clayton-Enquist (CE) absorbing boundary conditions. © 2005 Nanjing Institute of Geophysical Prospecting.

27344431729	Method of enhancing reflection seismic imaging resolution and its application	On the basis of the theory of generalized space resolution of seismic migration imaging, the high resolution horizontal stacking and optimal resolution seismic imaging may be realized by applying the inverse dynamic correction stretching method based on the theory. In the paper, according to the theory that the resolution of each seismic trace in common midpoint (CMP) gather can be reduced a-long with the increase in offset, the cause of forming dynamic correction stretching is explained and the stretching factor of the non-zero offset trace relative to the zero offset trace is derived in light of the generalized resolution formula. The stretch wave shape after dynamic correction can be corrected as the equivalent wavelet of the zero offset trace by use of the stretching factor, and, as compared with the conventional horizontal stocking, the resolution of the stacked section of CMP gather corrected by the stretching factor is greatly enhanced. In consideration of the theory of migration imaging resolution, the condition of selecting migration aperture in terms of the geological parameters of reflected waves is put forward in the paper. Through numerical calculation, it was proved that such an optimal imaging method with high resolution is feasible.

28744456163	Theoretical analysis of reflection seismic imaging resolution	Seismic resolution is an important topic in seismic data processing and imaging. Seismic resolution has been investigated for more than 50 years since Ricker, but it is focused only on the vertical resolution power of original surveyed seismic traces. In recent years the concept of the spatial resolution power of seismic imaging is introduced and discussed. Beylkin, Wu and Toksöz, Seggern, Vermmer, Chen and Schuster carried out many studies in the factors affecting the seismic imaging resolution by means of qualitative or experimental analysis. In this paper, I discuss the generalized seismic imaging resolution theoretically and provide a quantitative estimation of seismic imaging resolution after making the definition of the resolution power and the resolution ratio. The spatial imaging resolution is affected by 8 factors in 3D cases, which are seismic wave frequency f, propagation velocity v, offset 2 h, horizontal distance from the mid-point of offset to the surface location of image point L, azimuth of the line from the mid-point to the origin Oα, depth of imaging point z, azimuth of imaging resolution direction θ, angle between the imaging resolution direction and positive Z-axis β. Each of them plays a different role. These factors can be divided into three types: the first is observation parameters, such as λ and h; the second is imaging aperture parameters, such as L and α; and the last is geologic parameters, such as z, β and θ. To improve the imaging resolution, the important properties of spatial imaging resolution can be used: The imaging resolution comes up while the wavelength A decreases; The imaging resolution comes down while the depth of image point increases; The limited spatial resolution ratio of the seismic trace with maximum offset in imaging aperture is 1/2; The seismic trace with optimum spatial resolution is located at the surface point (l

28744459220	Migration velocity analysis of common focus point gathers based on velocity scanning	Common focus point (CFP) migration based on the equal travel-time principle is a kind of pre-stack depth migration method through focusing in both emission and detection. That is, to correct macro velocity model, differential time shift (DTS) is zero between the focus-point response and its time-inverse focus operator. Correlative energy between the operators and focus point responses is maximal. If the velocity is not correct, DTS is not zero any more and the correlative energy is small. But, according to DTS, we could update the erroneous operators. Through velocity scanning and maximum energy criterion, the optimal velocity corresponding to correct focusing operator could be obtained based on updated operators. In this way, the whole velocity could be modified and updated. Model tests and processing of real seismic data show the correctness and validity of our method.

Considered from the viewpoint of IIS and OIS, they belong to IIS. In this paper, the CRP stack and the CRS stack are presented as an OIS in constant velocity media. The numerical tests on the synthetic data shows that CRS stack by OIS exactly achieves what the CRS stack method claims to do in a different way. The implementation of the CRS stack by OIS reveals some interesting theoretical aspects of the CRS stack method which will help to understand CRS stack more deeply and promote its potential in application. © 2005 Geophysical Press Ltd.

3042814791	A semi-quantitative method for the reconstruction of eustatic sea level history from seismic profiles and its application to the southern South China Sea	A quantitative model is proposed to estimate the magnitude of eustatic sea level fluctuations on the basis of definitions of relative and eustatic sea level. In this model, factors such as erosion, sedimentation, compaction, basement tectonic and loading subsidence, and paleo-bathymetry are considered. To estimate incremental changes in eustatic sea level, we developed methods to solve for the variables involved in the model on the basis of interpretation of seismic profiles. We reconstructed the onlap/offlap points removed by erosion by fitting the effective thickness in areas without erosion with a piecewise-defined function and extrapolating this function to zero thickness. We used decompaction and backstripping algorithms to remove the effect of compaction and to calculate loading subsidence of the basement. Regional data, however, are needed to estimate the paleo-water depths and the tectonic subsidence. For this reason, our methodology is considered semi-qualitative. As an application of this model, an eustatic sea level curve since the Pliocene (5.33 my) was deduced from interpretation of our high-resolution seismic data from the northern Sunda Shelf, South China Sea (SCS). On this curve, 36 fourth order sea level cycles were recognized with periods ranging from 0.08 to 0.29 my. The curve matches well with the smoothed deep-sea stable oxygen isotope curves from benthic foraminifera. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

31344472375	A method of dip decomposition common reflection surface stack	Common Reflection Surface (CRS) stack is a macro-model independent zero-offset (ZO) imaging method. The traditional CRS stack operator is constructed according to a "data driven" strategy by searching and optimizing a set of wavefield attributes. A high quality ZO section is simulated by stacking along the operator optimized. However, the "data driven" strategy causes inevitable "angle discrimination phenomenon" which leads to loss of weak reflections and distortion of kinematical characteristic of the ZO section. Dip decomposition CRS stack proposed in this paper sloves the above two problems successfully, which makes the CRS stack method more practical.

According to the concept of "Settling Observation", the DSR equation prestack depth migration has become an important seismic imaging method. As compared with the one-way wave equation migration method, it has very high calculation efficiency,is convenient to export angle-domain common imaging gather and is beneficial to carrying out wave equation migration velocity analysis. The DSR equation full migration method needs high computer condition and can't be applied to the narrow azimuth 3-D seismic data existing greatly in seismic exploration. In combination with the wave propagator and imaging conditions of the DSR equation pre-stack depth migration, its application in the narrow azimuth 3-D seismic data imaging is discussed and the features and applying conditions of several stationary phase approximate DSR equation migration methods are contrasted and analyzed in the paper. The numerical examples indicated that the narrow (or common) azimuth prestack depth migration methods based on the DSR equation are possessed of great ability to image the complex geological structures, such as salt domes (or reefs) and buried hills, etc, and are worthy to be popularized in oil and gas exploration.

These frequency domain processing methods yield reasonable and consistent slowness estimations. Weighted spectral semblance is only able to give the slowness estimation for a single mode at each frequency. While homomorphic processing can also be used to calculate attenuation, amplitude and phase of one mode simultaneously. By introducing the SVD-TLS algorithm to determine the order of the wave modes, the Prony's method can be utilized to effectively estimate all the above parameters for more than one mode at all frequencies. In this study, we have also observed the crossover of flexural wave dispersion curves calculated by the weighted spectral semblance processing of the cross-dipole logs and determined subsequently the direction of the maximum horizontal formation stress of the surrounding formation.

Unfortunately, a low core recovery in the Oligocene strata affects understanding of the oligeocene strata based on geological and geochemical analyses of the core and core samples. In the paper, continuous geophysical well logs from Hole 1148A are used to inverse the mineral components and porosity. Based on the statistics of core analysis data, the Oligocene sediment is simplified as four formation components: terrigenous clastic minerals, carbonate, clay minerals, and porosity. Four well-log curves which are sensitive to lithology and/or porosity are chosen to construct the well-log response equation set, from which the volumetric percents for all the stratal components are solved with the least-squares method. The four well-log curves stand for uranium-free gamma ray, bulk density, photoelectric effect, and neutron porosity, respectively. Results matches well with the data from core analyses. The component solutions being substituted to the equation set, four modeled well logs are computed. Results are close to the corresponding measured well logs.

34447128714	Two-way subsurface directional illumination analysis by wave equation	The paper presents a quantitive method on the basis of seismic acquisition configuration for two-way subsurface directional illumination analysis in angle domain by means of wave equation propagation and wavefield decomposition in local angle domain from shot-and receiver-point, and for society of exploration geophysicists (SEG)-European association of geoscientists and engineers (EAGE) 2D salt dome model. The quantitive information on subsurface directional illumination is the energy distribution of incident and reflected wave in different subsurface structure dip angles. The information can not only be used to appraise the efficiency of acquisition configuration on subsurface targets, but also to analyze the influence of subsurface structures on seismic wave propagation path, and make an integrated evaluation on the result of wave equation prestack depth migration.

34250746928	DSR one-way wave equation prestack τ migration	By transforming the classical double-square-root (DSR) one-way wave equation from the depth domain to the two-way vertical traveltime (τ) domain, we derive an one-way DSR wave propagator which can be applied to mathematically implement "sinking survey". Its algorithm to recursively continue the source and receiver wavefields, which includes a wavenumber domain phase shift in a constant background medium followed by a phase correction in the space domain that accommodates lateral velocity variations, can tackle the effects of lateral velocity variations for imaging under complex overburdens. Combing with the zero-offset and zero-time imaging condition, we develop a DSR equation prestack migration method that implements wavefield continuation and imaging in the τ space. To address the problems that full volume 3-D DSR equation migration could meet with in production application, we present a feasible common-azimuth prestack τ migration approach based on the theory of crossline common-offset migration. Numerical tests show that DSR equation prestack τ migration provides a significant improvement over the traditional prestack time migration technology in laterally varying media.

34547965842	Relationships between offset domain/angle domain common image gathers and migration velocity	In order to probe the relationships between wave equation offset domain common image gathers (ODCIGs)/angle domain common image gathers (ADCIGs) with migration velocity, we quantitatively derive the changes of ODCIGs and ADCIGs along with migration velocity on the assumption of uniform velocity medium with a horizontal reflector. We come to conclusion that ODCIGs are hyperbolas with half offset; on the contrary, they are ellipses. Combined with the results of depth focusing analysis, we find the apparent incident angles in ADCIGs are larger than the real incident angles when the migration velocity is larger than the true one and vice versa. With lower migration velocity, the residual moveout (RMO) on ADCIGs is an ellipse with the tangent of apparent incident angle; otherwise, it's a hyperbola. In the valid seismic incident angle, ADCIGs are much more sensitive to the higher migration velocity. As to migration velocity analysis (MVA), it is suggested to start with a little higher initial velocity.

34547968694	Angle domain common image gather for wave equation	Wave equation prestack depth migration based on wavefield depth recursive extrapolation can hardly give out a common image gather in offset domain as accurately as Kirchhoff integral based prestack depth migration does. In order to make up for this defect, we have analyzed various methods of wave equation migration common image gather. And by using the single square root operator for wavefield extrapolation and the windowed Fourier frame expansion and reconstruction of wavefield, a method for local angle domain common image gather is proposed, i.e. common image gather in reflection angle domain of imaging point. The application of the angle domain common image gather in Marmousi model data and a two dimensional real seismic data yields ideal results. The angle domain common image gather method for wave equation derived in this paper will provide a foundation for further migration velocity analysis and amplitude versus angle analysis of migrated data.

34548066283	Illumination compensation for wave equation migration shadow	Due to the effects of complicated subsurface structures and seismic acquisition systems, the seismic wave illumination to some subsurface targets may be inhomogenous, so the seismic acquisition system can not effectively acquire the reflected information from these targets, and migrated images of these targets will have some migration shadows. Based on the windowed Fóurier frame expansion of wavefield and Green function, an illumination compensation method for wave equation migration shadow is proposed by using the wave equation migration and illumination analysis in angle domain and combining the wave equation inverse theory. The compensation method can take account into the effects of the seismic acquisition system and wave propagation path, remove the migration shadow on the complicated subsurface structures, and improve the results of wave equation prestack depth migration in complex structure regions.

36248951056	Using velocity filtering to improve decomposition of plane wave and migration	Prestack depth migration of plane wave is high effective depth migration technique and precious decomposition of plane wave is precondition of precious imaging of plane wave. Hyperbolic velocity filtering approach can effectively eliminate the alias and noise produced by z-p transform of CMP gather. The paper presented an approach using fast hyperbolic velocity filtering technique to improve the decomposition of plane wave and quality of migration: firstly, Mitchell fast hyperbolic filtering is carried out for CMP gather after τ-p transform; then, the offset plane wave is fitted into plane wave in shot domain; finally, the Fourier finite-difference depth migration is carried out for fitted plane wave, raising the precision of migration of plane wave by improving the quality of plane wave. Practical data processing showed the velocity filtering can effectively filter the noise produced by dip stack, significantly increase reflection energy and make events more continuous, the fault position more identified on the migrated imaging section.

37449023314	Double-square-root one-way wave equation prestack tau migration in heterogeneous media	In this paper, source-receiver migration based on the double-square-root one-way wave equation is modified to operate in the two-way vertical traveltime (τ) domain. This tau migration method includes reasonable treatment for media with lateral inhomogeneity. It is implemented by recursive wavefield extrapolation with a frequency-wavenumber domain phase shift in a constant background medium, followed by a phase correction in the frequency-space domain, which accommodates moderate lateral velocity variations. More advanced τ-domain double-square-root wave propagators have been conceptually discussed in this paper for migration in media with stronger lateral velocity variations. To address the problems that the full 3D double-square-root equation prestack tau migration could meet in practical applications, we present a method for downward continuing common-azimuth data, which is based on a stationary-phase approximation of the full 3D migration operator in the theoretical frame of prestack tau migration of cross-line constant offset data. Migrations of synthetic data sets show that our tau migration approach has good performance in strong contrast media. The real data example demonstrates that common-azimuth prestack tau migration has improved the delineation of the geological structures and stratigraphic configurations in a complex fault area. Prestack tau migration has some inherent robust characteristics usually associated with prestack time migration. It follows a velocity-independent anti-aliasing criterion that generally leads to reduction of the computation cost for typical vertical velocity variations. Moreover, this τ-domain source-receiver migration method has features that could be of help to speed up the convergence of the velocity estimation. © 2007 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers.

37449031606	General expression and modeling of 3D tilted transversely isotropy media in circle coordinate	Tilted transversely isotropic media refer to a case of transversely isotropy with tilted symmetry axes, which have rotating angles with different stiffness matrix in different rotating directions. The cases where transversely isotropy rotates along three axes are often studied, and the concept of circle coordinate system is presented in order to depict them generally. In the circle coordinate, many basic formulas of tilted transversely isotropy can be expressed easily, and a kind of monoclinic media's wave equations can be used to simulate wave field in different tilted transversely isotropic media. The modeling algorithm is staggered grid finite difference method. The numerical steps are implemented by using second order difference in time and high-order staggered grid difference in space. Numerical results of a model show that the above concepts are reasonable and feasible, and 3D anisotropic staggered gird difference method is implemented preferably.

37549047234	An integrated wave equation datuming scheme for the overthrust data based on the one-way extrapolator	The wave equation datuming (WED) is a necessary technique to deal with datuming correction in areas where the surface-consistent assumption is not valid. The previous datuming operations usually downward or upward continued the data from the surface to a planar datum. But for the overthrust data, it is always hard to find a planar base for the weathering layer (WL) or the low velocity layer (LVL). So the wave-equation layer replacement has to be done under the assumption that the base of the WL is non-planar. In this paper, an integrated WED scheme based on the one-way extrapolator applicable to the overthrust data is proposed. Firstly, the wave-field is downward continued to a non-planar base of the WL to remove the unexpected effects caused by the WL. Then, an upward continuation is applied to extrapolate the wave-field to a final planar datum with the replacement velocity. Either the downward or the upward continuation is accomplished by the one-way extrapolator such as finite-difference (FD) operator in a recursive way which constitutes an integrated wave-equation datuming scheme. © 2007 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

Through coordinate transforming, a common-azimuth prestack tau migration technology that recursively continues the source and receiver wavefields and picks up the migrated results in the two-way vertical traveltime (tau) direction is developed. The migrations of synthetic data sets of SEG/EAGE salt model prove that our common-azimuth migration approaches are effective in both depth and tau domains.

With migration in angle domain, the image matrix in local angle domain, the migration sections with different common-dip angles and reflection angles at imaging points are obtained. It provides fundamental data for processing approaches based on migration, such as analysis of amplitude versus angle, extraction of common image gather in angle domain and velocity analysis in angle domain. Numerical examples in a steep dip model and an international standard Marmousi model show that the wave equation migration method in angle domain is correct and effective.

4143103688	Prestack depth migration by surface rotation controlled illumination	The conventional shot-record prestack depth migration costs a very expensive amount of computations for wavefield extrapolations. Based on the fast areal shot technology, the controlled illumination prestack depth migration aims to efficiently achieve the high-quality image of the target structure by controlling the source wavefield at the target. The synthesis operators needed for areal short records are obtained by inversely extrapolating the predefined source wavefield at the target upward to the surface. We propose the surface rotation controlled illumination, as a more efficient scheme of controlled illumination. This scheme performs target-oriented illumination control over source wavefield directly at the surface and can produce high-quality image of the target zones. A surface synthesis operator function is simply constructed by geometrically rotating a certain kernel synthesis operator, instead of complicated wave extrapolations. This new controlled illumination method is as efficient as the general areal shot record technology, moreover, it is more powerful to image the complicated target zone. The application of the proposed technique to the Marmousi model gives a very ideal image of the deep complex structure.

4143124577	An applied theory on common reflection surface stack - From common reflection point to common reflection surface	Common Reflection Surface (CRS) stack is the best way at present to simulate zero-offset section. It can adapt to weak laterally inhomogeneous media. Common Reflection Surface is a circle segment around an underground reflector. Its traveltime response in the time-space domain, so-called CRS stack surface, can be regarded as a combination of all Common Reflection Point (CRP) trajectores in the segment. Based on a general CRP trajectory expression, with two kinds of eigen wave-Normal wave and Normal incidence wave being introduced, the traveltime response of CRS can be given by extending CRP expression via considering that all rays are reflected on the segment around the reflector according to paraxial approximation. This paper provides the applied theoretical foundation for CRS stacking.

Under the imaging condition based on reflection coefficients estimating, the prestack depth imaging can be realized. The operator is low-ordered equation but with high migration dip angle, and can accommodate arbitrary velocity variation owing to the finite difference algorithm. Contrasted with the methods in time-space domain, this one has high computation efficiency and is prone to image, because all its computation is in frequency-space domain. The impulse responses and the imaged result of the Marmousi model show that this migration operator has good imaging effect in strong laterally varying velocity media.

4444303528	Acoustoelastic effects on guided waves in a fluid-filled pressurized borehole in a prestressed formation	This paper investigates acoustoelastic effects on guided waves in a fluid-filled pressurized borehole in a biaxial prestressed formation, and develops a simplified formula that explicitly expresses the dependence of velocity dispersions on the stresses, the third-order elastic constants, and the azimuthal angle of multipole source polarization. The simplified formula shows that only in the flexural wave is there a crossover of the dispersion curves, and this phenomenon does not appear in every other guided wave. In particular, as a transformed result from the simplified expression, the square difference of flexural wave velocity dispersions is only dependent on the difference of the biaxial stresses, and neither the square sum of the flexural dispersions nor the velocity dispersions of the other guided waves is dependent on it. Computational results show that the sensitivity coefficients for the flexural dispersions induced by the biaxial stresses at low frequency asymptotically approach the corresponding coefficients of shear-waves in the formation, like the asymptotic behavior of velocities. © 2004 Acoustical Society of America.

A generalized screen wavefield propagator, which recursively propagates along the time direction, was derived in time domain. A prestack time migration algorithm base on the generalized screen wavefield propagator was established by using the time domain one-way wave generalized screen wavefield propagator for propagating the source wavefield and the recorded wavefield along the forward and the reverse time direction, respectively. The tests of the wave equation prestack time migration on the international standard 2D Marmousi model and a real 3D VSP seismic data demonstrated its validity and applicability to the lateral variations of velocity.

Those features in multiple time window could represent the variation of features with time in the trace when the TDNN has been trained with the features of traces near the wells. It can not only represent the complex relationship between features containing oil / gas in the layer, but also the relationship between the variation of features in the layer. Examples show that the TDNN model is more suitable to predict the reservior laterally than the BP model.

The seismic data structure characteristics refer to the wave characteristics shown in the discrete amplitude data points of each seismic trace arranged by the order of time. Based on the space-time relationship of seismic data structure characteristics, we can interpret the oil and gas layers quantitatively and find the oil-gas distribution rules on the seismic profile, so as to further improve the precision of reservoir prediction. Through the study on the space-time relationship of seismic amplitude for the main gas layers found in Well Kela-2 in Kela-2 Gasfield and Well Puguang-5 in Puguang Gasfield, the gas-layer boundary can be identified clearly, providing a strong basis for reserves estimation. This research method applies well to the target layers with depth of 200-7000 m and thickness of over 5 m, in the oil-gas provinces of various lithologies and sedimentary facies (marine, paralic and continental facies).

Under ensuring accuracy, to improve calculating efficiency and adaptability, the calculation method of first-arrival traveltime of finite-difference is derived based on any rectangular grid and a local plane wavefront approximation. In addition, head waves and scattering waves are properly treated and shadow and caustic zones cannot be encountered, which appear in traditional ray-tracing. The testes of two simple models and the complex Marmousi model show that the method has higher accuracy and adaptability to complex structure with strong vertical and lateral velocity variation, and Kirchhoff prestack depth migration based on this method can basically achieve the position imaging effects of wave equation prestack depth migration in major structures and targets.

67650284245	Target-oriented curved-wave prestack depth migration by controlled illumination	Conventional prestack depth migration (PSDM) based on full prestack data involves many computations for wavefield extrapolation. Areal shot-record technology offers an attractive alternative for efficient PSDM because its synthesis process greatly decreases the amount of prestack data required for migration. Constructing its synthesis operator is key to the image quality of the migrated areal shot record. Curved-wave PSDM technology expands areal shot-record migration. It constructs synthesis operators by defining a complex function as a base kernel of curved wavefields multiplied by a factor of its illumination perturbation related to ray parameter and then synthesizes curved wavefields for migrations. Based on curved-wave-migration theory, we propose an efficient and accurate curved-wave, controlled-illumination method to migrate in a target-oriented way. We construct tar-get-oriented synthesis operators by wave theory, combined with rotation or perturbation of the illuminating direction of a base-kernel synthesis operator. The base-kernel operator is obtained by inverse extrapolation of a predefined source wavefield at the given target level. Different model-constrained synthesis operators are constructed by rotating or perturbing illumination of the kernel operator. Then they are applied to shot records to synthesize curved-wave records. The resulting curved wavefields are entered for depth extrapolation and imaging, combining image results from different curved wavefields to produce the total image. The method controls the illumination of synthesized source wavefields in a target-oriented way directly at the surface and can achieve high-quality images of the target zone with great efficiency.

Numerical tables of one-way traveltime and propagation angle for the reflection waves are first established by improved ray-tracing algorithm in the laterally homogeneous media. After the two-way traveltimes, weighted factors, azimuth and incidence angles at the reflectors are estimated, 3-D structural images and angle-domain commonimage gathers are obtained through superposition of the impulse responses in the process of prestack time migration. Unlike the conventional approach, the implementation in this paper has taken ray-bending effect and 3-D propagation property of seismic waves in the real media into account. So it helps to extract variations of amplitude and moveout versus azimuth and incidenceangle more accurately. Synthetic and real data examples demonstrate the advantage and practicability of this technique.

The only obstacle to using the method is the requirement of huge computer storage. We extend the compressed format for storing the coefficient matrix. It can reduce the required computer storage dramatically. We get the optimal coefficients by least-squares method to suppress the numerical dispersion and adopt the perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary conditions to eliminate the artificial boundary reflections. Using larger grid intervals decreases computer storage requirements and provides high computational efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that these means are economic and effective, providing a good basis for elastic wave imaging and inversion. © Editorial Office of Applied Geophysics and Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2009.

70350676009	Upward continuation with topographic datuming operator: The integrated wave equation datuming scheme revised	The integrated wave equation datuming scheme is an integrated datuming method to implement the wave equation velocity replacement with a one-way extrapolator for overthrust data. The integrated wave equation datuming scheme is accomplished by downward continuing the data from the topography to a non-planar base of the weathering layer, followed by an upward continuation from the base of the weathering layer to a final planar datum. Both the downward and the upward continuation are accomplished by a one-way extrapolator by a classical 'two-step' implementation. The topographic datuming operator is a distinctive technique by which the shots and receivers are downward continued simultaneously. Although its inadaptability to non-planar datum and the strong lateral variation of the near-surface structure constrains its application to the downward continuation of the overthrust data, we found that the 'one-step' feature of the topographic datuming operator is extremely suitable for the upward continuation. In this paper, the topographic datuming operator is incorporated into the integrated wave equation datuming scheme to perform upward continuation instead of a one-way extrapolator - thus a revised integrated wave equation datuming scheme is constructed. Compared with the previous scheme, the computatiol cost of the revised integrated wave equation datuming scheme is greatly reduced, thus the applicability of the integrated wave equation datuming scheme is further improved. The synthetic and real data examples demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. © 2009 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers.

70449471750	Sensitivity kernels for seismic Fresnel volume tomography	Fresnel volume tomography (FVT) offers higher resolution and better accuracy than conventional seismic raypath tomography. A key problem in FVT is the sensitivity kernel. We propose amplitude and traveltime sensitivity kernels expressed directly with Green's functions for transmitted waves for 2D/3D homogeneous/heterogeneous media. The Green's functions are calculated with a finite-difference operator of the full wave equation in the frequency-space domain. In the special case of homogeneous media, we analyze the properties of the sensitivity kernels extensively and gain new insight into these properties. According to the constructive interference of waves, the spatial distribution ranges of the monochromatic sensitivity kernels in FVT differ from each other greatly and are 1/8, 2/8, 3/8 and 4/8 periods of seismic waves, respectively, for 2D amplitude, 3D amplitude, 2D traveltime, and 3D traveltime conditions. We also have a new understanding of the relationship between raypath tomography and FVT. Within the first Fresnel volume of the dominant frequency, the band-limited sensitivity kernels of FVT in homogeneous media or smoothly heterogeneous media are very close to those of the dominant frequency. Thus, it is practical to replace the band-limited sensitivity kernel with a few selected frequencies or even the single dominant frequency to save computation when performing band-limited FVT. The numerical experiment proves that FVT using our sensitivity kernels can achieve more accurate results than traditional raypath tomography. © 2009 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

71049192775	Application of an integrated wave-equation datuming scheme to overthrust data: A case history from the Chinese foothills	An integrated wave-equation datuming scheme improves the imaging quality of seismic data from overthrust areas. It can be regarded as integrated because upward-layer replacement is included. In this scheme, data are downward continued to a nonplanar datum (such as the base of the weathering layer), followed by upward continuation from the nonplanar datum to a final planar datum using a one-way extrapolator. When compared with a Kirchhoff integral, this method can deal better with the strong lateral velocity variation within the near surface. After a test on synthetic data, the scheme is applied successfully to real 2D overthrust data acquired in the Qi-Lian foothills, western China. Compared with results using static corrections, integrated wave-equation datuming results lead to better reconstruction of the diffractions and reflections, more reliable migration-velocity analyses, and stronger stack and final depth images. © 2009 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

The algorithm's main advantages lies in its ability to obtain high quality common imaging point gather in 3D angle domain, and to utilize sidewise scattering energy in improving the description for 3D faults, slant interface, fractures and other special geological bodies. The new algorithm could provide excellent solution for more and more high resolution imaging projects, attribute analysis projects and reservoir characterization projects in wide azimuth 3D seismic data. The synthetic data test for SEG/Hess VTI model in 2D Isotropic Media revealed the accuracy difference for the several angle domain imaging algorithms which were described in this paper. The synthetic data imaging results for 3D fault model show that the algorithm presented in this paper could reasonably describe the reflection time difference and the amplitude variations with the azimuth and the incidence angle.

0036630709	A fast and efficient common conversion point stacking technique for converted waves	Common conversion point (CCP) binning and non-hyperbolic normal moveout (NMO) are two key points to CCP stacking for converted waves. The accuracy of the existing methods is too low to be used for shallow-middle events or for large offsets. After studying CCP stacking technique in details, we presented new formulas for CCP points and non-hyperbolic time-distance relation, and as well, gave an implementation for CCP binning. The tests of synthetic model and processing of real data proved that our method is accurate and easy to be implemented. The stacking is good enough even for shallow-middle events and for large offsets.

79957567998	Analysis of absorption and dispersion characteristics of anelastic medium	Anelasticity of subsurface medium causes seismic energy absorption and phase-velocity dispersion and reduces the resolution of seismic image consequently. It has been one of the important objectives of seismic modeling and inversion. The micro-mechanism of seismic attenuation and dispersion is complicated and affected by many subsurface medium's environmental conditions. Based upon the Boltzmann superposition principle, the attenuation coefficient and phase-velocity dispersion equations of Kjartansson constant-Q model have been deduced systematically. The energy absorption and phase-velocity dispersion characteristics of eight anelastic models have been compared and analyzed completely. This research is contributive to study on the anelasticity of subsurface medium and related issues such as estimation of quality factor and inverse Q filtering.

79960052188	Azimuth-preserved local angle domain imaging for objects	Based on the analysis of the local directional characteristics of seismic waves, we discuss the methodology and applications of azimuth-preserved local angle domain prestack migration for isotropic and anisotropic media. Synthetic and real data examples show the properties and advantages of this seismic imaging approach, and also demonstrate its potential for several applications, such as delineation of the complex geological bodies with multiple angle of view, amplitude variations with incident-angle (AVA) analysis and inversion, azimuthal anisotropy analysis, etc. As multiple azimuth or wide azimuth acquisition are more widely used and the high-performance computer technology is quickly developed, we predict that azimuth-preserved local angle domain imaging approach will play an important role for imaging reservoirs and oil and gas prediction.

80052468604	Constrained optimization for velocity prediction in rock physics study	A new approach named "constrained optimization" for velocity model has been developed. This model focuses to the reservoir parameters for well-log evaluation with the inversion of pore aspect-ratio, so that rock elastic properties and velocities can be predicted accurately. For implementation, removing the environmental effects from well-logs is an important and hard stage because the quality of log data may be highly variable due to borehole environments with bad well conditions during logging. The principal effects in variability were usually from borehole enlargements or rugosity which may result in poor log data within certain depth intervals. In order to minimize these effects, the method of constrained optimization has been proposed in our study for one of gas fields in Sichuan basin which showed a good agreement to compare with the acquired core, image logs and fluid testing. The constrained optimization model provides an important improvement for the application of the Xu-White velocity model in which a variable pore aspect ratio log to be introduced into the Kuster and Toksöz model to replace the assumption of fixed aspect ratio. In summary, the constrained optimization model shows a significant improvement in the predicting of velocity for AVO analysis.

80052480894	Azimuth-preserved local angle domain imaging and its application to prestack time migration	Employing 3D prestack migration in azimuthal analysis allows for some structural dip and provides for higher signal to noise ratio in the measurements. Standard common-offset migration does not preserve azimuthal information. Recent attempts to move this analysis into migrated space concern source-receiver azimuth and offset on the surface, and generally involve some form of data sectoring. In fact, surface-azimuth and offset may be poor representations of the direction of wave path in the subsurface. Sectored migration may produce noisy prestack images owing to limited fold within the sectors and often requires large sectors leading to poor statistics for analysis of anisotropic properties. To tackle these problems, we present an azimuth-preserved local angle domain imaging approach that honors the local directional characteristics of the subsurface wave path in isotropic and vertical transversely isotropic media. The example has shown the advantage of our azimuth-preserved local angle domain Kirchhoff prestack time migration algorithm for azimuthal analysis.

84859122130	Converted-wave static correction method for thick weathering area	In P SV seismic data processing, there are some aspects different from conventional P P seismic data processing, such as S wave static correction, CCP binning, P SV velocity analysis and migration. Among them, the most difficult procedure is S wave static correction. Unlike P-wave velocity, the S wave velocity is almost unaffected by the water table and generally very low. Hence, the P-wave and S wave static solutions are largely different from each other, sometimes S wave statics are near ten times of P-wave' s. So the approximation of the S wave statics by simply scaling the known P-wave statics will lead to large errors and a good image can not be obtained. It has been proven that the time difference of first break between X and Z component in same receiver represents the travel time difference of P and S wave in weathering layer and it can be utilized to calculate S wave statics. This paper presents an accurate statics expression with respect to the time difference of first break and some velocity ratio parameter of near surface. Combined with residual statics estimated from common receiver stack section, an integrated converted wave static correction method has been presented. The method was applied to 2D 3C and 3D 3C data processing of Shulige gas field. The results show a good image which indicates that this method is effective for P SV data processing. This method is especially suitable for statics estimation of thick weathering area where other methods are disabled. Long period S wave statics are considered simultaneously.

84863116451	3D Kirchhoff prestack time migration in average illumination-azimuth and incident-angle domain for isotropic and vertical transversely isotropic media	Conventional offset domain prestack migration tends to bring ambiguity and migration artifacts because it smears energy from different angles at the image point. To avoid this, prestack depth migration implementations in angle domain have been investigated in the past decades. As an efficient imaging tool, angle domain Kirchhoff prestack time migration is still useful and was proposed recently. However, existing algorithms cannot handle ray bending and anisotropy correctly. Practically, azimuth analysis for fractured reservoirs should be carried out after migration for most geological settings. Unfortunately, the existing migration algorithm implicitly involves some kind of binning to source-receiver azimuth, which may not be the real wave-pathazimuth, especially for side-scattering or out-of-plane waves. In this paper, we present an algorithm for 3D Kirchhoff prestack time migration in average illumination azimuth and incident angle domain, which matches true wave path naturally and more accurately. To handle ray bending and vertical transversely isotropy, we propose several approaches to estimate two-way traveltime and the corresponding angular attributes through extended offset-to-angle mapping. Based upon these approaches, our 3D prestack time migration can provide high-quality common-image gathers for amplitude variation with incident angle and/or amplitude variation with offset and azimuth analyses, even in media with slight to moderate lateral heterogeneity. The 2D and 3D synthetic examples prove the validity of our methods. © 2011 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

84863117949	Curved-wave prestack depth migration	Conventional prestack depth migration (PSDM) based on point-source shot data involves a huge number of time-consuming wave extrapolations. Areal-source prestack data generated by a synthesis procedure can provide an alternative migration scheme that is efficient and accurate. We have developed a curved-wave synthesis method to implement curved-wave PSDM technology. A base-kernel synthesis operator is defined as a relative curved source-excitation datum. A general synthesis operator is constructed by disturbing the illumination directions of a base-kernel operator. The curved wavefields are synthesized by synthesis operators and then migrated by combination with a common-shot depth-migration algorithm. Curved wavefields can be constructed according to the configuration of a geologic structure to obtain a high-uality image of the target. Curved-wave records arising from different curved-source wavefields with different illumination properties are stacked after depth migration to produce an accurate image. A synthesis operator can be designed by simulating the configuration of target structures, or by velocity constraint in a target-oriented way, to efficiently achieve a high-uality image of a complex target area. Characteristic of curved excitation surface and space-variant illumination, the method is more adaptable to a complex medium than the plane-wave techniue and more efficient than shot migration. Numerical demonstrations on synthetic and real data have proved effective and given good results. © 2011 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

84863232597	An output imaging scheme of the 3D common reflection surface stack	Summary: Recently, the common reflection surface stack by an output imaging scheme (CRS-OIS) method is proposed to implement CRS stack in a different way. In previous literature, the CRS-OIS has been applied to 2D synthetic and real data successfully. In this paper, the CRS-OIS is extended to the 3D. The processed results based on 3D synthetic data show that the 3D CRS-OIS provide not only a superior 3D zero-offset (ZO) image, but also a better prestack dataset with higher signal/noise (S/N) ratio. Therefore, the 3D CRS-OIS serves as an appealing approach for processing 3D seismic data with low S/N ratio and expands the applicability of the 3D ZO CRS imaging theory.

84863418577	Azimuth-preserved local angle domain imaging in azimuthally anisotropic media	For seismic data with low fold and poor azimuthal sampling, more reliable imaging and azimuthal analysis can be achieved using azimuthal migration of full 3D data, rather than sectored isotropic migration of the azimuth-limited or common offset vector data. However, most routinely used prestack migration techniques only concern source-receiver azimuth and offset on the surface, which may be a poor representation of subsurface direction of the wavepath. To extract high-resolution angle-dependent reflectivity and detailed information from geologic targets, we present an azimuth-preserved local angle domain Kirchhoff prestack time migration approach which can tackle azimuthal anisotropy of the overburden and reservoir. Real data example is presented to prove the necessity of imaging in subsurface angle domain for properly focusing and revealing azimuth- and angle-dependent variations of residual moveout and migrated amplitude. © 2011 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

0038321414	Key techniques of seismic exploration for subsalt oil & gas structure in Kuche sag	Sub-salt oil & gas structures are the main gas source for the project of "West-East Gas Transmission" engineering. The seismic exploration of sub-salt oil & gas structures faces some severe problems caused by big dip of the overlying formations, strong up and down of the surface, great variance of the formation physical characteristics and shielding effects of the thick gyps-salt beds. The problems include the signal/noise ratio low, the static correction troublesome, and the imaging locating difficult, etc. which influence the success rate of sub-salt oil & gas structure exploration directly. Aiming to the problems, the effective techniques for acquisition, processing and interpretation of seismic data have been developed, such as the fine, survey technique of surface structures, the layout design in line with local conditions, the matching technique of static correction, the effective pre-stack depth migration and the structure modeling technique, etc. Applications of the above-mentioned techniques have properly solved the problems for sub-salt oil & gas structure exploration and found several big or medium size sub-salt oil & gas structures in this area. The exploration ideas are useful to the similar areas.

0038493246	Wave-equation-based decomposition and imaging for multivcomponrny seismic data	Compared with conventional single-component seismic data, multicomponent data in which both compressional (P) and shear (S) waves may exist, contain much additional information about the elastic parameters of the subsurface. Decomposition of multicomponent data into primary P- and S-wave responses and imaging of the decomposed wavefields are the two main procedures for multicomponent seismic data processing. Based on the imaged P-P and P-SV configuration, the rock- and pore parameters may be estimated. In this work, we first derive the decomposition formula from the elastic wave equation to divide the common shot gathers (CSP) of the displacement vector into scalar upgoing P- and SV-waves. According to the characteristics of the formula, the pure P-wave can be decomposed by revising the vertical component with the correction of the horizontal component, which can enhance the P-wave, but eliminate the SV-wave in the vertical component. Similarly, the pure SV-wave can be decomposed be revising the horizntal component with the use of the vertical component. The decomposition process requires the knowledge of the elastic parameters at the surface. Then we can construct the subsurface image by performing downward extrapolation of the separated scalar upgoing P- and SV-wavefields. The P-P and P-SV subsurface can be imaged independently with the correlation of forward extrapolation to each depth step from the source for downgoing waves and inverse extrapolation for the P- or SV-waves, based on the acoustic one-way equation for upgoing waves propagating with the respective P- or SV-wave velocity. The screen propagators can be used effectively in this case.

0038071528	Decomposition and migration for multicomponent seismic data	Decomposition of multicomponent seismic data into primary compressional (P) and shear (S) wave responses and migration of these decomposed wavefields are two main procedures for the multicomponent data processing. In this work, first we derive the decomposition formula from elastic wave equation to separate out the displacement vector with coupled P- and SV-waves into scalar upgoing P- and SV-waves. Pure P-wave can be decomposed by revising the vertical component with the correction of horizontal component, which can enhance P-wave but eliminate SV-wave in vertical component. Similarly, pure SV-wave can be decomposed by revising the horizontal component with the use of vertical component. Such a decomposition process requires only the knowledge of elastic parameters near the surface. Two kinds of migration schemes are then proposed to reconstruct the subsurface image by performing downward extrapolation of the separated scalar upgoing P- and SV-wave fields. For common shot gathers, the P-SV subsurface can be imaged with the correlation of forward extrapolation from the source for downgoing waves and inverse extrapolation for the upgoing P- or SV-waves with the respective P- or SV-wave velocity. The screen propagators can be used effectively in this case. For common offset sections, we modify the travel time equation of P-SV point scatterer and derive the corresponding migration equation. Results from synthetic data of one two-component record show that the P- and SV-waves are decomposed completely and the subsurface image for P-P waves is consistent with that of P-SV waves.

0041440169	Common imaging point gather migration velocity modeling based on wave equation	The imaging result of prestack depth migration (Pre-SDM) is quite sensitive to the migration velocity field, so a reasonable migration velocity modeling is the key to obtain the Pre-SDM imaging with high quality. Firstly, common imaging point (CIP) gathers are extracted by using wave equation Pre-SDM with high imaging precision. Then, based on the perturbation method, the quantitative relationship between the errors in migration velocity and those in imaged depth is established through the parameterized velocity function and the modified residual curvature analysis (RCA). Finally, the migration velocity modeling is realized using the single/multi parameter joint-iteration inversion. The test on Marmousi model shows that the method put forward in this paper has a stronger adaptability and better modeling and imaging results for complex geological bodies, and it is enough to only analyze and control the main reflectors through 3 to 4 iterations to meet the required precision.

0346317056	Double square root equation 3D prestack depth migration	Starting from the double square root (DSR) based wave equation, and based on the survey-sinking concept and the perturbation theory, we introduce a prestack depth full migration operator and an approach to construct common imaging gathers (CIGs). Considering the azimuthal characteristics of 3D prestack data, three DSR migration operators for common azimuth sections, cross-line common offset sections and common offset vector sections are developed respectively by the stationary phase method. Among them the cross-line common offset migration is a theoretically new DSR-based method. The theoretic analysis and examples on synthetic datasets show that the full migration operator and common azimuth migration operator have good performance in the case of strong velocity variation, but the other two operators can work only when the velocity varies smoothly.

84896298451	An integrated wave equation datuming scheme for the overthrust data based on the one-way extrapolator	The wave equation datuming (WED) is a necessary technique to deal with datuming correction in areas where the surface-consistent assumption is not valid. The previous applications of WED usually downward or upward continue the data from the surface to a planar datum. But for overthrust-belt data, it is always hard to find a planar base for weathering layer (WL). So the wave-equation layer replacement has to be done under the assumption that the base of WL is non-planar. In this paper, an integrated WED scheme applicable to the overthrust data is proposed. Firstly, the wave-field is downward continued to a non-planar base of the WL to remove the unexpected effects caused by the WL. Then, an upward continuation is applied to extrapolate the wave-field to a final planar datum with the replacement velocity. Either the downward or the upward continuation are accomplished by the one-way extrapolator such as finite-difference (FD) operator in a recursive way which constitutes an integrated wave-equation layer replacement scheme.

The test of a sag model proved that the method is more effective and adaptable for the velocity modeling of a complex geological body, and the accuracy of velocity analysis depends on the precision of optimized three parameters.

10844273252	Distribution of upper Cenozoic carbonate-cemented sandstones, Kuche Depression, northwest China: Insights from high-resolution borehole micro-resistivity imaging	High-resolution micro-resistivity images are used to study the distribution of neoformed carbonate concretions in Upper Cenozoic shallowly buried fluvial sandstones in the Kuche Depression, northwest China. The carbonate concretions are high-resistivity white facies on borehole images. Most of them occur as patches 1-40 cm thick and in shapes ranging from equant, oblate, to elongate. These concretions contrast markedly with the poorly cemented or uncemented host sandstones, which appear as dark to immediate grayscale facies on the images. Three patterns of occurrence of carbonate concretions are identified: isolated concretions, discontinously cemented layers, and continuously cemented layers. Most concretions occur in fine-grained, low-permeability laminae, suggesting that their growth was controlled more probably by diffusion transport rather than advective transport. Grain size, lamination, and distribution of intergranular clay all potentially influenced the selective distribution of carbonate cement in the sandstones. Shale interbeds and terrigenous carbonate rock fragments in the sandstones are potential sources of carbonate cement.

11744268609	Optimal paraxial wave equation 3-D post-stack depth migration	A crucial point in the processing of 3-D seismic data is the migration step, because of its 3-D nature and the computational cost involved. The efficiency and accuracy of 3-D migration are determined by the wavefield extrapolation technique employed. A new 3-D finite-difference post-stack depth migration operator has been created, which is very efficient and accurate at the same time. The 3-D migration operator has an almost perfect circular symmetry. No positioning errors in the 45-degree azimuth between the in-line and cross-line directions occur. The method can accommodate severe lateral velocity variations. On the other hand, with the optimally designed one-way paraxial wave-equation, this approach can deal with the imaging of steep dipping reflectors. Making use of an optimally consistent approximation and conjugate gradient optimization methods, we present a set of optimal absorbing boundary reflection equations. Tests with synthetic and field data demonstrate that the optimal absorbing boundary reflection equation can rather clearly absorb the boundary reflection for a variety of incident angles.
