1942503993	Study on the toxic effects induced by different arsenicals in primary cultured rat astroglia	Arsenic toxicity is a global health problem affecting millions of people. The objectives of this study were to determine if the toxic effects on primary cultured rat astroglia would be induced by different arsenicals. Based on alamarBlue assay and the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE, comet assay), the cell viability and DNA damage in the cells exposed to different arsenicals were evaluated. Treatment of astroglia with methylated arsenicals, that is, pentavalent monomethylarsonic acid (MMAV) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV), resulted in no obvious changes in cell viability and DNA damage at micromolar concentrations. However, treatment of astroglia with inorganic arsenicals, that is, arsenite and arsenate, caused decreased cell viability and increased DNA damage at micromolar levels, and showing a dose-related decrease in mean alamarBlue reduced rate and a dose-related increase in mean comet length. Our study is therefore highly suggestive for a link between inorganic exposure and cellular toxicity or DNA damage. Based on the results of this study, the toxic effects induced by arsenite were stronger than those induced by arsenate. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

20144386772	Vascular dysfunction in patients with chronic arsenosis can be reversed by reduction of arsenic exposure	Chronic arsenic exposure causes vascular diseases associated with systematic dysfunction of endogenous nitric oxide. Replacement of heavily arsenic-contaminated drinking water with low-arsenic water is a potential intervention strategy for arsenosis, although the reversibility of arsenic intoxication has not established. In the present study, we examined urinary excretion of cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP), a second messenger of the vasoactive effects of nitric oxide, and signs and symptoms for peripheral vascular function in 54 arsenosis patients before and after they were supplied with low-arsenic drinking water in an endemic area of chronic arsenic poisoning in Inner Mongolia, China. The arsenosis patients showed a marked decrease in urinary excretion of cGMP (mean ± SEM: male, 37.0 ± 6.1; female, 37.2 ± 5.4 nmol/mmol creatinine), and a 13-month period of consuming low-arsenic drinking water reversed this trend (male, 68.0 ± 5.6; female, 70.6 ± 3.0 nmol/mmol creatinine) and improved peripheral vascular response to cold stress. Our intervention study indicates that peripheral vascular disease in arsenosis patients can be reversed by exposure cessation and has important implications for the public health approach to arsenic exposure.

0030982743	Mercury dynamics in hair of rats exposed to methylmercury by synchrotron radiation x-ray fluorescence imaging	Two-dimensional distribution of mercury (Hg) in hair samples of rats exposed to methylmercury (MeHg) was analyzed by synchrotran radiation X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) imaging. Experiments with endogenous- and exogenous- model for MeHg exposure revealed that the metal level was obviously higher in the hair cortex after the former exposure whereas a dominant site that Hg distributed after the latter exposure was the cuticle. The method also provided us the Hg profile along the hair length with a single hair obtained by the endogenous model. Thus application of SR-XRF analysis to hair sample would facilitate biological monitoring to not only distinct Hg exposure but also determine its dynamics with only the specimen.

0031586748	Gene deficiency of glutathione- S-transferase μ isoform associated with susceptibility to lung cancer in a Chinese population	Increased lung cancer risk associated with genetic polymorphism of glutathione S-transferase (GST, EC 2.5.1.18) isozyme μ was examined in a Chinese population. A significantly higher proportion in lung cancer patients showed GST μ deficiency compared with control group (71.0% vs. 51.1%, P < 0.005). Although the susceptibility to lung cancer showing gene deletion for GST μ isoform in non-smoking group is not significantly different from that in smoking group, a great number of individuals with gene deletion was found among cancer patients who are less than 50 years old. The pathology of lung tumors related to that lack of class μ isoform which occurred most frequently in patients with small cell carcinomas. Thus, present data further support that sensitivity to chemical toxins and pulmonary carcinogens may be affected by GST μ isoform polymorphism.

0032546872	Serum antioxidant vitamins and risk of lung and stomach cancers in Shenyang, China	In a hospital-based case control study, we measured serum concentrations of vitamin A, β-carotene and vitamin E for subjects with cancer (58 cases of lung cancer and 22 cases of stomach cancer) and 63 matched controls in Shenyang, China. Lung cancer patients had significantly (P < 0.01) lower mean serum levels of vitamin A, β-carotene and vitamin E than controls, while the mean serum level of vitamin E did not differ between stomach cancer patients and the controls. Lower serum levels of vitamin A, vitamin E and β-carotene were associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Lower serum levels of vitamin A and β-carotene were associated with a higher risk of stomach cancer, although the number of cases was small. An increased risk of lung cancer associated with lower serum levels of vitamin A and vitamin E was more evident among heavy smokers than among non-heavy smokers.

0032622538	A case-control study of the relationship between dietary factors risk of lung cancer in women of Shenyang, China	A 1:1 case-control study of lung cancer incidence among women in Shenyang was conducted to explore the relationship between diet and the risk of lung cancer, with emphasis on the potential effects of a list of specific dietary constituents on modifying lung cancer risks. Dietary information on 290 cases and population-matched controls was obtained by personal interviews. Multiple logistic regression models were used for the statistical analysis and summarization of the data. A significant difference was found between cases and controls with respect to intake of β-carotene, vitamin C and fibers, all of which reduced the risk for lung cancer in a dose-dependent manner; yielding calculated odds ratio (OR) of 0.84, 0.75, and 0.46. respectively. The apparent effects of these nutrients persisted after adjusting for cigarette smoking, suggesting that they may function as protective factors to reduce the risk for lung cancer in Chinese women.

3242777067	Arsenic contamination and arsenicosis in China	Arsenicosis is a serious environmental chemical disease in China mainly caused by drinking water from pump wells contaminated by high levels of arsenic. Chronic exposure of humans to high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water is associated with skin lesions, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, blackfoot disease, and high risk of cancers. Lead by the Ministry of Health of China, we carried out a research about arsenicosis in China recently. Areas contaminated with arsenic from drinking water are determined by 10% pump well water sample method while areas from burning coal are determined by existing data. Two epidemic areas of Shanxi Province and Inner Mongolia are investigated for the distribution of pump wells containing high arsenic. Well water in all the investigated villages of Shanxi Province showed polluted by high arsenic, and the average rate of unsafe pump well water is 52%. In Inner Mongolia, the high percentage of pump wells containing elevated arsenic is found only in a few villages. The average rate of unsafe pump well water is 11%. From our research, we find that new endemic areas are continuously emerging in China. Up to now, epidemic areas of arsenicosis mainly involve eight provinces and 37 counties in China. In the affected areas, the discovery of wells and coal with high levels of arsenic is continuing sporadically, and a similar scattered distribution pattern of patients is also being observed. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

3242786542	Evaluation of DNA damage in patients with arsenic poisoning: Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanine	The relationship between arsenic exposure and DNA damage in patients with acute or chronic arsenic poisoning was analyzed. Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanine (8-OHdG) concentrations were measured as an indication of oxidative DNA damage. A remarkable increase in 8-OHdG in the urine was observed in 60% of 52 patients with acute arsenic poisoning from the accidental oral intake of the arsenic trioxide. This was two- to threefold higher than levels in normal healthy subjects (n = 248). There was a clear relationship between arsenic concentrations in urine after acute poisoning and elevated levels of 8-OHdG. Levels of urinary 8-OHdG returned to normal within 180 days after the acute arsenic poisoning event. In patients chronically poisoned by the consumption of well water with elevated levels of arsenate [As(V)], elevated 8-OHdG concentrations in urine were also observed. A significant correlation between the 8-OHdG levels and arsenic levels in the urine was observed in 82 patients with chronic poisoning. Thus, evidence of oxidative DNA damage occurred in acute arsenic poisoning by arsenite [As(III)] and in chronic arsenic poisoning by As(V). In chronic poisoning patients provided low-arsenic drinking water, evidence of DNA damage subsided between 9 months and 1 year after the high levels of arsenic intake were reduced. The initial level of arsenic exposure appeared to dictate the length of this recovery period. These data indicate that some aspects of chronic and acute arsenic poisoning may be reversible with the cessation of exposure. This knowledge may contribute to our understanding of the risk elevation from arsenic carcinogenesis and perhaps be used in a prospective fashion to assess individual risk. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

33646864496	Arsenic speciation transported through the placenta from mother mice to their newborn pups	The primary goal of the present study was to confirm the arsenic species that can be transferred from the mother to the bodies of newborn pups through the placenta and the speciated arsenic distribution in the liver and brain of newborn mice after gestational maternal exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs). Mother mice were exposed to iAsIII and iAsV in drinking water during gestation. The livers and brains of the mother mice and their newborn pups were taken. Contents of iAs, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and trimethylarsenic (TMA) compound were detected using the HG-AAS method. Contents of iAs, MMA, and DMA in the liver of mother mice increased with the concentration of arsenite or arsenate in their drinking water. However, only DMA increased with the concentration of arsenate or arsenite in the drinking water in the brain of mother mice. On the other hand, contents of both iAs and DMA in the liver and brain of newborn mice increased with the concentration of arsenate or arsenite administered to their mother orally. Contents of arsenic species in the liver and brain of both mother mice and their newborn pups were significantly lower in the 10 ppm iAsV group than in the 10 ppm iAsIII group. Ratios of iAs or DMA levels between the brain and the liver of newborn mice were larger than 1, whereas those in mother mice were much smaller than 1. iAs taken from drinking water was distributed and metabolized mainly in the liver of mother mice. iAsIII in low levels may be taken up and metabolized easily in the liver compared to iAsV. Both iAs and DMA are transferred from the mother through the placenta and cross the immature blood-brain barrier (BBB) easily. Compared to that in the liver of newborn mice, DMA as an organic metabolite is prevalent in brain, a lipidic organ, if the BBB is not matured enough to prevent it from entering the brain. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33745978798	Effects of sodium arsenite on catalase activity, gene and protein expression in HaCaT cells	The objective of this research work is to study the effects of sodium arsenite on activity, mRNA and protein expression of catalase (CAT) in established human cell lines of keratinocytes (HaCaT). Based on the AlamarBlue assay, we found that a high level (100 μmol/l) of sodium arsenite inhibited cell viability. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in cells was increased in all treated cultures dose-dependently. CAT activity, mRNA expression and protein levels were decreased by 5-20 μmol/l of sodium arsenite. It is highly suggestive that CAT gene expression and protein levels are affected by arsenic. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33747885816	Effects of winter air pollution on pulmonary function of school children in Shenyang, China	To assess the effects of air pollution associated with coal heating in winter on pulmonary function of school children, pulmonary function tests (FVC, FEV<inf>1.0</inf>, PEF, FEF<inf>75</inf>) of 332 children in Shenyang, located in the northeast of China, were done four times between October 2001 and June 2002. The collected airborne particulate matter (PM) was analyzed for the concentrations of total suspended particles (TSP), PM of less than 7 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM<inf>7</inf>), and PM of less than 2.1 μm (PM<inf>2.1</inf>). All four pulmonary function tests were completed in 244 school children. The airborne PM concentration was higher in April 2002 (end of heating) than in October 2001 (prior to heating). All four pulmonary function indices, adjusted for age and height, were significantly lower in April 2002 than in October 2001; the FEV<inf>1.0</inf> was lower in boys (0.233 l, 95% CI: 0.167-0.299 l) and girls (0.222 l, 95% CI: 0.165-0.280 l). The decrease continued to be significant in June 2002 compared to October 2001. The decreases in FEV and FEV<inf>1.0</inf> were also significantly associated with airborne PM concentration, which had a delayed effect on pulmonary function. An increase from the 25th to the 75th percentile of TSP, PM<inf>7</inf> and PM<inf>2.1</inf> was associated with a delayed decrease in FEV<inf>1.0</inf>; 0.059 l (95% CI: 0.020-0.106 l), 0.095 l (95% CI: 0.057-0.139 l) and 0.110 l (95% CI: 0.072-0.147 l) in boys, and 0.066 l (95% CI: 0.026-0.106 l), 0.101 l (95% CI: 0.063-0.139 l) and 0.114 l (95% CI: 0.080-0.152 l) in girls, respectively. Our findings show that airborne PM might have a subacute effect on pulmonary function in children in Shenyang, and that PM<inf>7</inf> and PM<inf>2.1</inf> have more adverse effects on pulmonary function than TSP. The effects of airborne PM appear to be prolonged. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

33750382706	DNA damage induced by fluoride in rat osteoblasts	A study is reported of DNA damage by fluoride to primary calvarial osteoblasts of newborn rats isolated by enzymic digestion. Sodium fluoride at concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 mmol/L was administered to the isolated osteoblast cells for 24 hr, and damage to DNA was determined by single cell gel electrophoresis assay (SCGE = Comet assay). Breakage of DNA strands occurred at 2 mmol/L NaF and above. Compared with the control group, the comet tail length was significantly increased, indicating that, at sufficient concentrations, fluoride can induce DNA damage in osteoblasts.

33846514000	Current research problems of chronic arsenicosis in China	Chronic arsenicosis is a newly-emerged public-health issue in China and many other Asian countries. Over 200 million people are estimated to be at the risk of high arsenic exposure from drinking-water in the Asian region. To protect people from the hazards of chronic arsenic poisoning, the Chinese Government has been providing low-arsenic drinking-water to some seriously-affected rural areas, such as Inner Mongolia autonomous province. Results of follow-up studies showed that both the average values of arsenic, including inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylated arsenic, dimethylated arsenic and trimethylated arsenic, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanine in urine, decreased significantly after drinking low-arsenic water for one year, and arsenic-specific skin lesions also improved to some extent. However, a five-year follow-up study showed no more significant improvement of skin lesions, while the potential risk of arsenic-induced cancers after cutting off high-arsenic exposure was still uncertain and indefinite. The susceptibility of children compared to adults to chronic arsenic exposure and the need to re-evaluate the appropriate standard of arsenic in drinking-water were also discussed in this paper. © 2006 International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh.

34247110919	Urinary arsenic metabolites in children and adults exposed to arsenic in drinking water in inner Mongolia, China	Background: We report the concentrations and distributions of urinary arsenic (As) metabolites in 233 residents exposed to 20, 90, or 160 μg/L inorganic arsenic (iAs) in drinking water from three villages in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China, that formed one control and two exposed groups. Methods: We used hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrometry (HGAAS) to determine iAs, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Results: The concentrations of each urinary As species in the two exposed groups were significantly higher than in the control group for both children and adults. Both children and adults in exposed groups had higher percent iAs and MMA and lower percent DMA, and low primary and secondary methylation indices (PMI and SMI, respectively) than those in the control group. However, children showed significant increases in percent DMA and the SMI as well as decreases in the percent MMA when the iAs exposure level increased from 90 to 160 μg/L. In addition, children in the two exposed groups showed lower percent MMA but higher percent DMA and higher SMI than adults in the same exposed group. No significant differences in As metabolite concentrations and distributions were found between males and females in each group. A significant correlation was also found in the SMI between 11 pairs of children and their mothers from the 160-μg/L-exposed group. Conclusions: Children had higher a capacity for secondary methylation of As than adults when exposed to the same concentrations of iAs in drinking water. Exposure to As may increase the capacity for methylation in children to some extent.

35748932066	Low selenium status affects arsenic metabolites in an arsenic exposed population with skin lesions	Background: The antagonistic effects between selenium (Se) and arsenic (As) suggest that low selenium status plays important roles in arsenism development. However, no study has been reported for humans suffering from chronic arsenic exposure with low selenium status. Methods: Sixty-three subjects were divided into 2 experimental groups by skin lesions (including hyperkeratosis, depigmentation, and hyperpigmentation). Total urine and serum concentrations of arsenic and selenium were determined by ICP-MS with collision/reaction cell. Arsenic species were analyzed by ICP-MS coupled with HPLC. Results: The mean concentration of As in the drinking waters was 41.5 μg/l. The selenium dietary intake for the studied population was 31.7 μg Se/d, and which for the cases and controls were 25.9 and 36.3 μg Se/d, respectively. Compared with the controls, the skin lesion cases had lower selenium concentrations in serum and urine (41.4 vs 49.6 μg/l and 71.0 vs 78.8 μg/l, respectively), higher inorganic arsenic (iAs) in serum (5.2 vs 3.4 μg/l, P < 0.01), higher percentages of iAs in serum and urine (20.2 vs 16.9% and 18.3 vs 14.5%, respectively, P < 0.01) but lower percentages of monomethylarsonate (MMA) in serum (15.5 vs 18.8%, P < 0.01) and dimethylarsinate acid (DMA) in urine (65.1 vs 69.8%, P < 0.01). Subjects with lower selenium concentrations in serum (< 50 μg/l) had a stronger tendency to the risk of skin lesions than individuals having higher selenium concentrations [odds ratio (OR), 7.3; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.5-35.7; P = 0.014]. This OR estimation was confirmed in those subjects having higher ratios of As/Se in urine and serum, with OR as high as 10.3 and 3.8 respectively. Conclusions: Lower serum selenium status (< 50 μg/l) is significantly correlated to the arsenic-associated skin lesions in the arsenic exposed population. The accumulation of iAs and its inhibition to be biotransformed to DMA occurred in human due to chronic exposure of low selenium status. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0034068291	Decreased serum concentrations of nitric oxide metabolites among Chinese in an endemic area of chronic arsenic poisoning in inner Mongolia	Prolonged exposure to arsenic results in peripheral and cardiovascular manifestations, as does impaired production of endothelial nitric oxide (NO). In vitro studies have indicated that endothelial cells undergo damage by arsenic. However, no information has been available on the relationship between NO synthesis and chronic arsenic poisoning in humans. The present study was designed to reveal this question. The subjects were 33 habitants who continued to drink well water containing high concentrations of inorganic arsenic (mean value = 0.41 μg/ml) for about 18 years in Inner Mongolia, China, and 10 other people who lived in this area but exposed to minimal concentrations of arsenic (mean value = 0.02 μg/ml) were employed as controls. Mean blood concentration of total arsenic was six times higher in exposed subjects than controls; 42.1 vs. 7.3 ng/ml, p < .001. Mean serum concentration of nitrite/nitrate, stable metabolites of endogenous NO, was lower in arsenic-exposed subjects than in controls: 24.7 vs. 51.6 μM, p < .001. In total samples, an inverse correlation with serum nitrite/nitrate levels was strong for blood inorganic arsenic (r = -0.52, p < .001) and less strong for its metabolites, monomethyl arsenic (r = -0.45, p < .005) and dimethyl arsenic (r = -0.37, p < .05). Furthermore, serum nitrite/nitrate concentration was significantly correlated with nonprotein sulfhydryl level in whole blood (r = 0.58, p < .001). In an in vitro study, we demonstrated that inorganic arsenite or arsenate suppresses the activity of endothelial NO synthase in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These results suggest that long-term exposure to arsenic by drinking well water possibly reduces NO production in endothelial cells, resulting in a decrease in reduced nitrite/nitrate concentrations. Peripheral vascular disorders caused by arsenic may be attributable in part to impairment of NO production in vivo. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

0034604636	ζ-Crystallin catalyzes the reductive activation of 2,4,6- trinitrotoluene to generate reactive oxygen species: A proposed mechanism for the induction of cataracts	Exposure to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) has been shown to cause induction of cataract in which oxidative stress plays a critical role. From bovine lens we purified to homogeneity and identified an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of TNT, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species. The final preparation of TNT reductase showed a single band with a subunit molecular weight of 38 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Sequence data from peptides obtained by digestion with lysylendopeptidase Achromobacter protease I (API) revealed that TNT reductase is identical to ζ-crystallin. Superoxide anions were formed during reduction of TNT by ζ-crystallin, though negligible enzyme activity or protein content for superoxide dismutase, a superoxide scavenging enzyme, was found in the lens. Thus, the present results suggest that the induction of cataracts by TNT may be associated with increased oxidative stress, as a result of reductive activation of TNT generating superoxide anions, there being minimal antioxidant enzyme activity for defense against reactive oxygen species exogenously produced in the lens.

0034716975	Improved method for simultaneous determination of L-arginine and its mono- and dimethylated metabolites in biological samples by high-performance liquid chromatography	An improved method has been developed for the determination of L-arginine and its methylated metabolites, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), N(G),N(G)-dimethyl-L-arginine (asymmetric DMA, ADMA) and N(G),N(G)'-dimethyl-L-arginine (symmetric DMA, SDMA) in biological samples. Extraction of these compounds with a strong cation-exchange resin AG50W-X8 with L-homoarginine (2-amino-6-guanidinohexanoic acid) as an internal standard gave a recovery of more than 70% except for SDMA from plasma samples. After extracted samples were converted to fluorescent derivatives with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) in an alkaline medium, the following high-performance liquid chromatographic separation with a ODS column (wide-pore size, 300 A) was successfully performed with an isocratic mobile phase system. The method permits quantitative determination of L-arginine and its methylated metabolites at concentrations as low as 4 μM and 0.18 μM, respectively. Using this method, the levels of L-arginine, L-NMMA, ADMA and SDMA in human plasma, urine and rat tissue were determined. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

77954782557	Urban particulate matter in Beijing, China, enhances allergen-induced murine lung eosinophilia	It has been reported that ambient particulate matter (PM) in some large cities, such as Beijing, China, causes adverse respiratory health effects. However, there is currently no experimental report on the relationship between bronchial asthma and urban PM (UPM) in northeast Asia. In this study, the microbial and chemical substances adsorbed onto UPM collected in Beijing were excluded by heat-treatment at 360°C for 30min. The effects of UPM or heated UPM (H-UPM) toward allergic lung inflammation were compared in murine lungs to investigate the role of organic substances. ICR mice were administrated intratracheally with the two kinds of UPM and/or ovalbumin (OVA) 4 times at 2-week intervals. UPM and H-UPM enhanced eosinophil recruitment induced by OVA in the alveoli and in the submucosa of the airway, which has a goblet cell proliferation in the bronchial epithelium. UPM and H-UPM synergistically increased Th-2 cytokinesinterleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, eosinophil-relevant cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-5 and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3), induced by OVA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The enhancing effects were much greater in UPM than in H-UPM. UPM induced adjuvant effects on specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgG1 production by OVA. In an in vitro study using RAW264.7 cells, UPM increased the expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) mRNA, but not TLR4 mRNA. H-UPM caused no expression of both TLR mRNAs. These results suggest that the aggravated lung eosinophilia in UPM was due to activation of a Th2-associated immune response via the activation of TLR2 by microbial materials. Chemical materials of air pollutant origin contained in UPM, and inorganic components (elemental carbon, mineral elements) in H-UPM, could also cause the aggravation. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.

84877780775	Association of urinary monomethylated arsenic concentration and risk of hypertension: A cross-sectional study from arsenic contaminated areas in northwestern China	Background: Although some studies mainly from Taiwan, Bangladesh and the United States, have suggested a consistent dose-response increase in the prevalence of hypertension with increasing arsenic exposure, the association between chronic environmental arsenic exposure and the risk of hypertension is still inconclusive. Most of the studies discussed the association from the point of view of arsenic concentration in drinking water or cumulative arsenic exposure (CAE), few involved arsenic speciation into the discussion. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the potential association between environmental arsenic exposure through drinking water and the prevalence of hypertension by analyzing not only CAE but also urinary arsenic speciation, and provided data on arsenic exposure and hypertension from mainland of China. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in one of the arsenic contaminated areas in the northwest of China. Among a total of 1005 residents who voluntarily participated in the study, 604 of eligible subjects were confirmed and interviewed door to door. Standing height, body weight, and blood pressure were measured. First void urine was collected and measured for the concentration of urinary arsenic speciation. CAE was calculated in a subpopulation of 360 subjects with detailed water consumption history. The association between urinary arsenic speciation, CAE and the risk of hypertension were analyzed by multiple logistic regressions. Results: We found that the levels of urinary arsenic species of inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylated arsenic (MMA), dimethylated arsenic (DMA) and total arsenic (tAs) were significantly correlated with systolic or pulse blood pressure. A positive relationship was found between the highest tertile of CAE and hypertension in a dose-dependent manner. Subjects with higher concentration of urinary MMA or lower percentage of DMA tended to be liable to suffer from hypertension. A significant increasing trend of the risk of hypertension with increasing tertiles of MMA concentration was also observed in the logistic regression models both before and after adjustment for confounders. Conclusions: Our findings suggested that arsenic exposure, especially high level of CAE, was positively associated with the prevalence of hypertension, and that higher concentration of urinary MMA might be related to the increased susceptibility to hypertension. © 2013 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84877863267	Effects of airway exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate on allergic rhinitis	Recent epidemiological studies have suggested a positive link between atopy morbidity and exposure to phthalate esters, which are environmental chemicals mainly involved in house dust. Nevertheless, experimental studies applying several allergic in vivo models (in addition to epidemiological studies) are needed to prove the precise correlation between phthalates and facilitation of the allergic response/pathophysiology. Among the phthalate esters, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (D.E.*HP) has been widely used in flexible polyvinyl chloride products, including vinyl flooring and wall covering, and has been widely suggested to have immunomodulating potential. In the present study, we examined the effects of airway exposure to D.E.*HP on allergen (ovalbumin: OVA)-induced rhinitis in mice. The repeated administration of OVA via an intranasal route induced nasal inflammation characterized by the infiltration of granulocytes (neutrophils and eosinophils) into the nasal cavity. In this experimental setting, D.E.*HP did not exaggerate OVA-related inflammatory pathology. However, local (nasal) IL-13 levels were significantly higher in mice treated with allergen plus D.E.*HP than with allergen alone. Taken together, phthalate esters including D.E.*HP have the potential to exacerbate the allergic milieu in the nasal system, as well as dermal and respiratory systems. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

84887613421	Coupling predicted model of arsenic in groundwater with endemic arsenism occurrence in Shanxi Province, Northern China	Statistical modeling has been used to predict high risk area of arsenic (As) hazard, but information about its application on endemic arsenism is limited. In this study, we aim to link the prediction model with population census data and endemic arsenicosis in Shanxi Province, Northern China. 23 explanatory variables from different sources were compiled in the format of grid at 1km resolution in a GIS environment. Logistic regression was applied to describe the relationship between binary-coded As concentrations data and the auxiliary predictors. 61 endemic arsenism villages were geo-located and combined with output maps of the prediction model. Linear regression was used to identify the relationship between arsenicosis occurrence rate and predictive As probability at village level. Our results show that 6 explanatory environmental variables were significantly contributed to the final model. Area of 3000km

Clinical examinations were performed by physicians in a local hospital. Excreted urinary arsenic species were determined by cold trap hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry. In the initial toxic phase, gastrointestinal symptoms were predominant (83 people, 79.8%). Most patients showed leucopenia (72 people, 69.2%), and increased serum alanine aminotransferase (84 people, 80.8%) and aspartate aminotransferase (58 people, 55.8%). Thirty-five patients (33.6%) had elevated red blood cells in urine. After 17 days of admission, many subjects (45 people, 43.3%) developed peripheral neuropathy and 25 of these 45 patients (24.0%) showed a decrease in motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity. In the comparison of urinary arsenic metabolites among subacute arsenic-poisoned, chronic high arsenic-exposed and control subjects, we found that subacute arsenic-poisoned patients had significantly elevated proportions of urinary inorganic arsenic (iAs) and methylarsonic acid (MMA) but reduced proportion of urinary dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) compared with chronic high arsenic - exposed and control subjects. Chronic exposed subjects excreted higher proportions of iAs and MMA but lower proportions of DMA in urine compared with control subjects. These results suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms, leucopenia, and hepatic and urinary injury are predominant in the initial phase of subacute arsenic poisoning. Peripheral neuropathy is the most frequent manifestation after the initial phase. The biomethylation of arsenic decreases in a dose rate-dependent manner. © The Author 2008.

51549116631	Association of oxidative stress with arsenic methylation in chronic arsenic-exposed children and adults	Though oxidative stress is recognized as an important pathogenic mechanism of arsenic, and arsenic methylation capacity is suggested to be highly involved in arsenic-related diseases, the association of arsenic methylation capacity with arsenic-induced oxidative stress remains unclear. To explore oxidative stress and its association with arsenic methylation, cross-sectional studies were conducted among 208 high and 59 low arsenic-exposed subjects. Levels of urinary arsenic species [inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylated arsenic (MMA) and dimethylated arsenic (DMA)] were determined by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry. Proportions of urinary arsenic species, the first methylation ratio (FMR) and the secondary methylation ratio (SMR) were used as indicators for arsenic methylation capacity. Urinary 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) concentrations were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in whole blood were determined to reflect anti-oxidative status. The high arsenic-exposed children and adults were significantly increased in urinary 8-OHdG concentrations but decreased in blood GSH levels compared with the low exposed children and adults. In multiple linear regression models, blood GSH levels and urinary 8-OHdG concentrations of arsenic-exposed children and adults showed strong associations with the levels of urinary arsenic species. Arsenic-exposed subjects in the lower and the upper quartiles of proportions of urinary arsenic species, FMR or SMR were significantly different in urinary 8-OHdG, blood GSH and SOD. The associations of arsenic methylation capacity with 8-OHdG, GSH and SOD were also observed in multivariate regression analyses. These results may provide linkage between arsenic methylation capacity and oxidative stress in humans and suggest that adverse health effects induced by arsenic are related to arsenic methylation through oxidative stress. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

51849158706	Urinary arsenic speciation and its correlation with 8-OHdG in Chinese residents exposed to arsenic through coal burning	In contrast to arsenicosis caused by consumption of water contaminated by naturally occurring inorganic arsenic, human exposure to this metalloid through coal burning has been rarely reported. In this study, arsenic speciation and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels in urine were determined in the Chinese residents exposed to arsenic through coal burning in Guizhou, China, an epidemic area of chronic arsenic poisoning caused by coal burning. The urinary concentrations of inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and total arsenic (tAs) of high-arsenic exposed subjects were significantly higher than those of low-arsenic exposed residents. A biomarker of oxidative DNA damage, urinary 8-OHdG level was significantly higher in high-arsenic exposed subjects than that of low exposed. Significant positive correlations were found between 8-OHdG levels and concentrations of iAs, MMA, DMA and tAs, respectively. In addition, a significant negative correlation was observed between 8-OHdG levels and the secondary methylation ratio (DMA/(MMA + DMA)). The results suggest that chronic arsenic exposure through burning coal rich in arsenic is associated with oxidative DNA damages, and that secondary methylation capacity is potentially related to the susceptibility of individuals to oxidative DNA damage induced by arsenic exposure through coal burning in domestic living. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

65249090388	Determination of total arsenic and arsenic metabolites in human liver hepatocytes	The effects of direct sampling and three digestion methods were investigated on the determination of arsenic in Chang liver hepatocytes after ultrasonic disintegration were investigated. The results showed that the efficiency of microwave digestion and obturator digestion was better than cold digestion and direct sampling. The day precision (present as RSD) of microwave digestion and obturator digestion were 2.1% and 1.2%, the inter-day precision were 1.2% and 2.0%, respectively. The spike recovery for the total As in the sample is 95.7% -108.1%. The As detection limits with these four sample treatment methods (including direct sampling) were 0.74 -0.93 μg/L. In addition, arsenic speciation in Chang liver hepatocytes was also analyzed using the hyphenated technique of high performance liquid chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The experimental results indicated that dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and an intermediate metabolite of DMA were found in Chang liver hepatocytes besides inorganic arsenic (As (III) and As(V)).

67651171244	Transplacental and early life exposure to inorganic arsenic affected development and behavior in offspring rats	To evaluate the developmental neurotoxicity of arsenic in offspring rats by transplacental and early life exposure to sodium arsenite in drinking water, the pregnant rats or lactating dams, and weaned pups were given free access to drinking water, which contained arsenic at concentrations of 0, 10, 50, 100 mg/L from GD 6 until PND 42. A battery of physical and behavioral tests was applied to evaluate the functional outcome of pups. Pups in arsenic exposed groups weighed less than controls throughout lactation and weaning. Body weight of 10, 50 and 100 mg/L arsenic exposed groups decreased significantly on PND 42, 16 and 12, respectively. Physical development (pinna unfolding, fur appearance, incisor eruption, or eye opening) in pups displayed no significant differences between control and arsenic treated groups. The number of incidences within the 100 mg/L arsenic treated group, in tail hung, auditory startle and visual placing showed significant decrease compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In square water maze test, the trained numbers to finish the trials successfully in 50 and 100 mg/L arsenic exposed groups increased remarkably compared to control group, and there was a dose-related increase (p < 0.01) observed. Taken together, these data show that exposure of inorganic arsenite to pregnant dams and offspring pups at levels up to 100 mg/L in drinking water may affect their learning and memory functions and neuromotor reflex. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

70249107429	Lack of association of glutathione-S-transferase omega 1(A140D) and omega 2 (N142D) gene polymorphisms with urinary arsenic profile and oxidative stress status in arsenic-exposed population	Individual variability in arsenic metabolism is suggested to be associated with the effects of chronic arsenic exposure on health. Glutathione-S-transferase omega (GSTO) 1 and 2 are known to have the activity of monomethyl arsenate [MMA(V)] reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme for the biotransformation of inorganic arsenic. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between polymorphisms in the GSTO1 and GSTO2 genes and arsenic metabolism and oxidative stress status in Chinese populations chronically exposed to different levels of arsenic in drinking water. Two polymorphisms (GSTO1*A140D and GSTO2*N142D) with relatively higher mutation frequencies in the Chinese population were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The allele frequencies of 140D and 142D in the entire study population were 0.17 and 0.25, respectively. There were no significant differences in the urinary arsenic profile, the blood reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, the blood superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, or the urinary 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels between the study subjects with different genotypes of GSTO1*A140D or GSTO2*N142D. Multivariate analysis revealed that there was no association between the urinary profile or oxidative stress status and the polymorphism of GSTO1*A140D or GSTO2*N142D. Collectively, polymorphisms in GSTO1 or GSTO2 do not appear to contribute to the large individual variability in arsenic metabolism or susceptibility to arsenicosis. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

77953255611	Low-level arsenic impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells: Involvement of cellular adaptive response to oxidative stress	Background: Chronic exposure of humans to inorganic arsenic, a potent environmental oxidative stressor, is associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). A key driver in the pathogenesis of T2D is impairment of pancreatic β-cell function, with the hallmark of β-cell function being glucose- stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from glucose metabolism serve as one of the metabolic signals for GSIS. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a central transcription factor regulating cellular adaptive response to oxidative stress. oBjectives: We tested the hypothesis that activation of Nrf2 and induction of antioxidant enzymes in response to arsenic exposure impedes glucose-triggered ROS signaling and thus GSIS. Methods and results: Exposure of INS-1(832/13) cells to low levels of arsenite led to decreased GSIS in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Consistent with our hypothesis, a significantly enhanced Nrf2 activity, determined by its nuclear accumulation and induction of its target genes, was observed in arsenite-exposed cells. In keeping with the activation of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response, intracellular glutathione and intracellular hydrogen peroxide-scavenging activity was dose dependently increased by arsenite exposure. Although the basal cellular peroxide level was signifi- cantly enhanced, the net percentage increase in glucose-stimulated intracellular peroxide production was markedly inhibited in arsenite-exposed cells. In contrast, insulin synthesis and the consensus GSIS pathway, including glucose transport and metabolism, were not significantly reduced by arsenite exposure. Conclusions: Our studies suggest that low levels of arsenic provoke a cellular adaptive oxidative stress response that increases antioxidant levels, dampens ROS signaling involved in GSIS, and thus disturbs β-cell function.

77955141751	Effects of exogenous GSH and methionine on methylation of inorganic arsenic in mice exposed to arsenite through drinking water	We hypothesized that chronic exposure to arsenic would deplete the reduced glutathione (GSH) and methionine in vivo, thereby impair the methylation capacity of inorganic arsenic (iAs) ingested. Our experiment was designed to explore the effects of exogenous GSH and methionine on arsenic methylation in mice exposed to arsenite via drinking water. Levels of iAs, monomethylarsenic acid (MMAs), and dimethylarsenic acid (DMAs) in the liver and blood were determined by the method of hydride generation coupled with atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Compared with mice exposed to arsenite alone, administration of GSH or methionine increased the secondary methylation index in the liver and primary methylation index in the blood, which resulted in the consequent increase of DMAs percent and decrease of iAs percent in the blood. Moreover, administration of GSH resulted in the increase of DMAs percent in the liver and total arsenic in the blood. Increase of total arsenic in the blood was mainly due to the increase of DMAs. Findings from the present study suggested that administration of GSH or methionine might potentiate the methylation capacity of arsenic in both liver and extrahepatic tissues, which may facilitate the excretion of arsenic and decrease arsenic related toxicities in the body. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

77956191766	Distribution of speciated arsenicals in mice exposed to arsenite at the early life	The aim of this study was to explore distribution of speciated arsenicals in mice exposed to arsenite at early developmental stages. Levels of speciated arsenicals in both liver and brain of mice were analyzed by hydride generation of volatile arsines, and determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (HG-AAS). In the liver, levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs) increased on postnatal day (PND) 15, and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) increased on PND 21, however, levels of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in newborn mice were significantly higher than those on PND 10 and 15. In the brain, levels of iAs on PND 21 were the highest; iAs levels on PND 15 were also significantly higher than those on PND 35. Our results suggested transplacental transfer of arsenicals from pregnant mice into their fetus was relatively efficient, lactational transfer from mother mice into their offspring was inefficient, and transfer of iAs from blood into brain at early developmental stages was efficient. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77957554731	Airborne Asian sand dust enhances murine lung eosinophilia	There is no experimental study demonstrating the effects of airborne Asian sand dust (AASD) on allergic lung eosinophilia. The organic substances adsorbed onto AASD collected from the atmosphere of Iki-island in Japan were excluded by heat treatment at 360°C for 30min. The effects of AASD or heated-AASD (H-AASD) towards allergic lung inflammation were compared in murine lungs to investigate the role of organic substances. ICR mice were administrated with the two kinds of AASD and/or ovalbumin (OVA) intratracheally four times at 2-week intervals. AASD and H-AASD enhanced eosinophil recruitment induced by OVA in the alveoli and in the submucosa of the airway, which has a goblet cell proliferation in the bronchial epithelium. AASD and H-AASD synergistically increased Th2 cytokinesinterleukin-13 (IL-13), eosinophil-relevant cytokine and chemokine, such as IL-5, and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3) induced by OVA in whole lung lavage fluid. The enhancing effects were much greater in AASD than in H-AASD. AASD induced adjuvant effects on OVA-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgG1 production. In an in vitro study using RAW264.7 cells, AASD increased the expression of Toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2) mRNA, but not TLR4 mRNA. AASD increased mRNA expression of NALP3, ASC, and IL-1β compared with the control. H-AASD caused no expression of either mRNA. These results suggest that the aggravated lung eosinophilia in AASD is due to activation of a Th2-associated immune response and that the activation of TLR2 and NALP3 inflammasome by microbial materials could be participating in this phenomenon. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

79952773633	Arsenic methylation capacity and its correlation with skin lesions induced by contaminated drinking water consumption in residents of chronic arsenicosis area	Chronic exposure to excess level of arsenic through contaminated drinking water is associated with many injuries, among which skin lesions are the most prominent. In this study, we measured the concentrations of inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in the blood of the residents of arsenicosis area, who demonstrated different skin lesion grade from mild, moderate to advanced. We evaluated the individual methylation capacity by two indices of the first and secondary methylation ratio (FMR and SMR). We found that SMR of moderate and advanced groups were markedly lower than that of mild group. Significant negative correlation was found between SMR of all the subjects and the grade of skin lesion, with Spearman's correlation coefficient of -0.429 (P = 0.016). Moreover, blood MMA proportion of moderate and advanced groups was found to be significantly higher than that of the mild group. These results suggest that low secondary arsenic methylation capacity and high MMA proportion are associated with the severity of arsenic-related skin lesions. Our findings evaluated by blood speciation is consistent with that evaluated by the generally accepted urinary arsenic speciation in the relationship between arsenic methylation capacity and arsenic-related lesions. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

79953877312	Effects of exogenous glutathione on arsenic burden and NO metabolism in brain of mice exposed to arsenite through drinking water	Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) is associated with neurotoxicity. Studies to date have disclosed that methylation of ingested iAs is the main metabolic pathway, and it is a process relying on reduced glutathione (GSH). The aim of this study was to explore the effects of exogenous GSH on arsenic burden and metabolism of nitric oxide (NO) in the brain of mice exposed to arsenite via drinking water. Mice were exposed to sodium arsenite through drinking water contaminated with 50 mg/L arsenic for 4 weeks and treated intraperitoneally with saline solution, 200 mg/kg body weight (b.w), 400 mg/kg b.w, or 800 mg/kg b.w GSH, respectively, at the 4th week. Levels of iAs, monomethylarsenic acid, and dimethylarsenic acid (DMAs) in the liver, blood, and brain were determined by method of hydride generation coupled with atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Activities of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and contents of NO in the brain were determined by colorimetric method. Compared with mice exposed to arsenite alone, administration of GSH increased dose-dependently the primary and secondary methylation ratio in the liver, which caused the decrease in percent iAs and increase in percent DMAs in the liver, as a consequence, resulted in significant decrease in iAs levels in the blood and total arsenic levels in both blood and brain. NOS activities and NO levels in the brain of mice in iAs group were significantly lower than those in control; however, administration of GSH could increase significantly activities of NOS and contents of NO. Findings from this study suggested that exogenous GSH could promote both primary and secondary arsenic methylation capacity in the liver, which might facilitate excretion of arsenicals, and consequently reduce arsenic burden in both blood and brain and furthermore ameliorate the effects of arsenicals on NO metabolism in the brain. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79953706854	Prolonged inorganic arsenite exposure suppresses insulin-stimulated AKT S473 phosphorylation and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes: Involvement of the adaptive antioxidant response	There is growing evidence that chronic exposure of humans to inorganic arsenic, a potent environmental oxidative stressor, is associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). One critical feature of T2D is insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, especially in mature adipocytes, the hallmark of which is decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (ISGU). Despite the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS), they have been recognized as a second messenger serving an intracellular signaling role for insulin action. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a central transcription factor regulating cellular adaptive response to oxidative stress. This study proposes that in response to arsenic exposure, the NRF2-mediated adaptive induction of endogenous antioxidant enzymes blunts insulin-stimulated ROS signaling and thus impairs ISGU.

79955952643	Metabolic profile and assessment of occupational arsenic exposure in copper- and steel-smelting workers in China	Purpose: Analyze the urine arsenic (As) metabolite profiles of workers in copper-and special steel-smelting plants and explore the potential occupationally As exposure as well as the individual arsenicosis risk. Methods: A total of 95 male workers from two plants, located in northeastern part of China, were recruited. Information about each subject was obtained by questionnaire. Inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in urine and airborne As concentrations of working sites were determined. Results: Airborne As concentrations in copper smelter sites were significantly higher than steel smelter sites. Workers in copper smelter had significantly higher concentrations of iAs, MMA, DMA in urine with creatinine adjustment but a lower value of primary methylation index (PMI) than that of steel-smelting plants workers. The higher proportion of the inorganic form but the lower proportion of DMA form of copper smelter workers was compared to that of steel smelter workers, and the concentration of DMA in steel smelter workers' urine significantly increased linearly with seafood consumption. Seven workers in copper smelter were found to have hyperkeratosis or/ and hyper-pigmentation, and their urine showed higher iAs% but lower DMA% and PMI compared to other workers without As dermatosis at the same level of As exposure. Conclusions: Release of As dust produced in crude ore extracting and smelting is the main pollution source of As in copper smelter plant. The methylation capacity of As decreases with the increase in As exposure level, and skin damage caused by As is associated with decreasing methylation capacity.

0036226578	Evidence for induction of oxidative stress caused by chronic exposure of Chinese residents to arsenic contained in drinking water	Exposure of experimental animals or cultured cells to arsenic induces oxidative stress, but, to date, no examination of this phenomenon in humans has been reported. In this study we conducted a cross-sectional study in Wuyuan, Inner Mongolia, China, to explore the relationship between chronic arsenic exposure from drinking water and oxidative stress in humans. Thirty-three inhabitants who had been drinking tube-well water with high concentrations of inorganic arsenic (mean value = 0.41 mg/L) for about 18 years constituted the high-exposure group, and 10 residents who lived nearby but were exposed to much lower concentrations of arsenic in their drinking water (mean value = 0.02 mg/L) were selected as the low-exposure comparison group. Results of the present study indicated that although the activity for superoxide dismutase (SOD) in blood did not differ significantly between the two groups, the mean serum level of lipid peroxides (LPO) was significantly higher among the high-exposed compared with the low-exposed group. Elevated serum LPO concentrations were correlated with blood levels of inorganic arsenic and its methylated metabolites. In addition, they showed an inverse correlation with nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) levels in whole blood. The subjects in the high-arsenic-exposure group had mean blood NPSH levels 57.6% lower than those in the low-exposure group. Blood NPSH levels were inversely correlated with the concentrations of inorganic arsenic and its methylated metabolites in blood and with the ratio of monomethylarsenic to inorganic arsenic. These results provide evidence that chronic exposure to arsenic from drinking water in humans results in induction of oxidative stress, as indicated by the reduction in NPSH and the increase in LPO. Some possible mechanisms for the arsenic-induced oxidative stress are discussed.

0036589742	2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene-induced reproductive toxicity via oxidative DNA damage by its metabolite	Several epidemiological studies and animal experiments showed that 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), a commonly used explosive, induced reproductive toxicity. To clarify whether the toxicity results from the interference of endocrine systems or direct damage to reproductive organs, we examined the effects of TNT on the male reproductive system in Fischer 344 rats. TNT administration induced germ cell degeneration, the disappearance of spermatozoa in seminiferous tubules, and a dramatic decrease in the sperm number in both the testis and epididymis. TNT increased the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in sperm whereas plasma testosterone levels did not decrease. These results suggest that TNT-induced toxicity is derived from direct damage to spermatozoa rather than testosterone-dependent mechanisms. To determine the mechanism of 8-oxodG formation in vivo, we examined DNA damage induced by TNT and its metabolic products in vitro. 4-Hydroxylamino-2,6-dinitrotoluene, a TNT metabolite, induced Cu(II)-mediated damage to

80052697120	Arsenicosis history and research progress in Mainland China	This article provides the history of arsenicosis in Mainland China and the research situation in the recent 10 years. The first large area of arsenicosis caused by high levels of arsenic in drinking water in Mainland China was discovered in Kuitun, Xinjiang Province, in 1983. The government attached great importance to arsenicosis and finally regarded it as the epidemic disease throughout the nation in 1994. Until 2006, the survey areas of wells with arsenic concentration greater than 50 μg/L in drinking water have involved 16 provinces in Mainland China. The molecular epidemiological studies on relationship between arsenic metabolism and manifestations of arsenicosis caused by chronic exposure to high level of arsenic in drinking water and the studies on arsenic exposure and related health effects in different arsenic exposure populations are summarized in this review.

In this study, a survey of arsenic concentration in cold-springs and pump-wells was carried out in Hui County, Northwest China. A total of 352 drinking water samples, including 177 cold-springs and 175 pump-wells, were collected. The maximum arsenic concentrations in cold-springs and pump-wells were 0.482 mg/L and 0.067 mg/L, respectively. We found that 15.8% (28) of total cold-springs and 1.1% (2) of total pump-wells had arsenic concentrations exceeding the maximum allowable concentration of arsenic in drinking water of rural China (0.05 mg/L). Our findings show that 5 cold spring-contaminated villages are located in the mountainous areas of Hui County and 2224 inhabitants may be at risk of high arsenic exposure. This paper indicates that arsenic contamination of cold-springs may be more serious than expected in mountainous areas of Northwest China and extensive surveys and epidemiological studies should be carried out to investigate the potential contaminated areas and affected population. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84855453637	Nuclear factor erythroid-derived factor 2-related factor 2 regulates transcription of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β during adipogenesis	Nuclear factor erythroid-derived factor 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a cap-n-collar basic leucine zipper transcription factor that is involved in the cellular adaptive response to oxidative stress. Our previous study reported that targeted disruption of the Nrf2 gene in mice decreases adipose tissue mass and protects against obesity induced by a high-fat diet. Deficiency of Nrf2 in preadipocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts led to impaired adipogenesis. Consistent with these findings, the current study found that lack of Nrf2 in primary cultured mouse preadipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells hampered adipogenic differentiation induced by hormonal cocktails. Stable knockdown of Nrf2 in 3T3-L1 cells blocked the enhanced adipogenesis caused by deficiency of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), a Cul3-adapter protein that allows for Nrf2 to be ubiquinated and degraded by the 26S protesome complex. In addition, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of Nrf2 occurred at the very early stage upon adipogenic hormonal challenge in 3T3-L1 cells, followed by an immediate induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ). Knockdown of Nrf2 led to reduced expression of C/EBPβ induced by adipogenic hormonal cocktails, chemical Nrf2 activators or Keap1 silencing. Cebpβ promoter-driven reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation suggested that Nrf2 associates with a consensus antioxidant response element (ARE) binding site in the promoter of the Cebpβ gene during adipogenesis and upregulates its expression. These findings demonstrate a novel role of Nrf2 beyond xenobiotic detoxification and antioxidant response, and suggest that Nrf2 is one of the transcription factors that control the early events of adipogenesis by regulating expression of Cebpβ. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

84855795050	Asian sand dust enhances murine lung inflammation caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae	Inhaling concomitants from Asian sand dust (ASD) may result in exacerbation of pneumonia by the pathogen. The exacerbating effect of ASD on pneumonia induced by Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) was investigated in ICR mice. The organic substances adsorbed onto ASD collected from the atmosphere of Iki-island in Japan were excluded by heat treatment at 360. °C for 30. min. ICR mice were instilled intratracheally with ASD at doses of 0.05. mg or 0.2. mg/mouse four times at 2-week intervals (total dose of 0.2. mg or 0.8. mg/mouse) and were administrated with ASD in the presence or absence of KP at the last intratracheal instillation. Pathologically, ASD caused exacerbation of pneumonia by KP as shown by increased inflammatory cells within the bronchiolar and the alveolar compartments. ASD enhanced the neutrophil number dose dependently as well as the expression of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α) and chemokines (KC, MCP-1, MIP-1α) related to KP in BALF. In an in vitro study using RAW264.7 cells, combined treatment of ASD and KP increased gene expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-β, KC, MCP-1, and MIP-1α. The same treatment tended to increase the protein level of IL-1β, TNF-α and MCP-1 in a culture medium compared to each treatment alone. The combined treatment tended to increase the gene expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and NALP3, ASC and caspase-1 compared with KP alone. These results suggest that the exacerbation of pneumonia by ASD. +. KP was due to the enhanced production of pro-inflammatory mediators via activation of TLR2 and NALP3 inflammasome pathways in alveolar macrophages. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

84861302249	Application of Google Earth in the prevention and management of drinking water type of endemic arsenism	Objective: To construct geographic information database of drinking water type of endemic arsenism at village level with Google Earth and provide scientific basis for prevention and management of endemic arsenism. Methods Drinking water samples were collected in the field of Shilegetu village, Tuoketuo county, Inner Mongolia in 2008. Arsenic concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry. Global positioning system (GPS) was performed to obtain the geographic information of the water sources. Google Earth was applied to establish the geographic information database. Results There were 5 drinking water resources in this village. They were located between 40°29'09'' N and 40°29'36'' N latitude and 111°28'00'' E and 111°29'02'' E longitude, with the altitude between 1010 m and 1021 m. For all drinking water resources, four water arsenic concentrations was beyond 0.05 mg/L and one below 0.05 mg/L. In addition, one water source had been abandoned and the remaining four were providing daily drinking water for residents of the villages. Conclusions The geographic information database, established by Google Earth, can intuitively reflect the real situation of the endemic village. It can provide more useful information for field epidemiological research. It is an effectively tool in control and management of endemic arsenism.

Methods: Residents in Shanxi exposed to different concentrations of arsenic in drinking water and age ≥ 18 years old adults were chosen as the subjects for this study in 2008, the subjects were divided into three groups according to the concentrations of arsenic in drinking water: high-arsenic exposure group (more than 0.05 mg/L), low-arsenic exposure group (between 0.01 and 0.05 mg/L) and control group(less than 0.01 mg/L), excluded recently had eaten seafood and had poisoning symptoms of chronic arsenic in drinking water in the crowd. Smoking and alcohol drinking habits were investigated by questionnaire. Arsenic species in the urine samples were detected with hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy. Total arsenic(tAs) was the sum of iAs%, MMA% and DMA%. iAs%, MMA% and DMA% were calculated as iAs/tAs, MMA/tAs and DMA/tAs, respectively. The first methylation ratio (FMR) and the secondary methylation ratio(SMR) were calculated as (MMA + DMA)/tAs and DMA/(MMA + DMA), respectively. Results: Three hundred and ninety-five adults were chosen in this study. In the high exposure group the alcohol drinking and smoking subjects had higher MMA%(16.24%) but lower SMR (82.19%) than the non-drinking and non-smoking subjects (12.16% and 86.13%, respectively). The differences of both MMA% and SMR were significant (P < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the non-smoking/non-drinking subjects and the smoking or the drinking subjects(all P > 0.05). In the low exposure group there were higher MMA%(13.86%, 13.99%) lower DMA% (72.87%, 77.76%) and lower SMR (83.48%, 83.90%) in those with smoking or drinking/smoking compared with the non-drinking and non-smoking subjects (11.83%, 80.35% and 86.54%, respectively, all P < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between drinkers and non-drinking/non-smoking subjects (P > 0.05). In the control group there were a higher MMA% (17.27%, 17.06%) lower DMA% (73.89%, 72.29%) and lower SMR (81.48%, 82.58%) in those with smoking or drinking/smoking compared with the non-drinking and non-smoking subjects (11.52%, 79.68% and 87.19%, respectively, all P < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between drinkers and the non-drinking/non-smoking subjects (all P> 0.05). Conclusion: The arsenic methylation capacity of people with drinking and smoking is poorer than that of non-drinking and non-smoking subjects after arsenic exposure.

84864876083	Arsenic methylation pattern and its association with oxidative stress status in populations exposed to arsenic in drinking water in China	The present study focuses on arsenic methylation pattern and its association with oxidative stress status in populations exposed to arsenic in drinking water in China. The results demonstrated that arsenic methylation capacity decreases with the increase in the dose rate or the time of arsenic exposure. Male and female are not different in methylation pattern, but children have higher arsenic methylation capacity than adults. The exposure to high levels of arsenic in drinking water results in the decrease of anti-oxidant capacity, which means that oxidative DNA lesions elevate with the increase in the dose rate or the time of arsenic exposure. The oxidative stress status of arsenic-exposed population is closely related to arsenic methylation capacity, which underlies the possible mechanism of relationship between variability of arsenic methylation pattern and susceptibility to arsenicosis. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.

84866100823	Aggravating effects of Asian sand dust on lung eosinophilia in mice immunized beforehand by ovalbumin	Asian sand dust (ASD) event may result in a significant influence on an asthmatic patient. However, for obvious reasons, there is no experimental study in which asthmatic patients are exposed to ASD. This study was undertaken to clarify the effects of ASD on lung eosinophiliain mice immunized beforehand by ovalbumin (OVA). CD-1 mice were instilled intratracheally with OVA four times at 2-week intervals. Simultaneous intratracheal administration of OVA and ASD (OVA + ASD sim) at the last OVA treatment or intratracheal administration with ASD 1 day before (OVA + ASD pre) /after (OVA + ASD post) the last OVA treatment was performed to investigate the effects of OVA and ASD exposure timing. The three kinds of treatment (OVA + ASD pre; OVA + ASD sim; OVA + ASD post) aggravated allergic lung inflammation and proliferation of goblet cells in the airway epithelium in mice, as evidenced by the cellular profile of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and pathological examination. As an overall trend, these changes were paralleled with the expression of Th2-associated effecter molecules and eosinophil relevant cytokine chimokines in BALF as well as the production of OVA-specific IgG1 compared with OVA treatment alone. OVA + ASD sim aggravated lung eosinophilia remarkably compared with the other treatments. The order of the potency of the aggravation was OVA+ASD pre < OVA+ASD post <OVA+ASD sim. These results indicate that ASD has a potent effect in activating lung eosinopilia in mice immunized beforehand by OVA. The simultaneous exposure of asthmatic patients to ASD and its antigen may have serious consequences for such individuals. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

0038378515	Oxidative stress from fluoride-induced hepatotoxicity in rats	The role of oxidative stress in fluoride hepatotoxicity was investigated. Three groups of eight 4-week-old Wistar rats were given 50, 100, and 150 mg NaF/L in their drinking water for three months. Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) and serum glutamate oxalate transaminase (SGOT) activities increased significantly, suggesting hepatic damage. Alterations of the oxidative and the antioxidant system in the liver were confirmed by the significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) together with enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities in that organ. Oxidative damage from oxidative stress therefore appears to be an important pathway for fluoride-induced hepatotoxicity.

84867163992	Developmental fluoride neurotoxicity: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Background: Although fluoride may cause neurotoxicity in animal models and acute fluoride poisoning causes neurotoxicity in adults, very little is known of its effects on children's neurodevelopment. Objective: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies to investigate the effects of increased fluoride exposure and delayed neurobehavioral development. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Water Resources Abstracts, and TOXNET databases through 2011 for eligible studies. We also searched the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, because many studies on fluoride neurotoxicity have been published in Chinese journals only. In total, we identified 27 eligible epidemiological studies with high and reference exposures, end points of IQ scores, or related cognitive function measures with means and variances for the two exposure groups. Using random-effects models, we estimated the standardized mean difference between exposed and reference groups across all studies. We conducted sensitivity analyses restricted to studies using the same outcome assessment and having drinking-water fluoride as the only exposure. We performed the Cochran test for heterogeneity between studies, Begg's funnel plot, and Egger test to assess publication bias, and conducted meta-regressions to explore sources of variation in mean differences among the studies. Results: The standardized weighted mean difference in IQ score between exposed and reference populations was -0.45 (95% confidence interval: -0.56, -0.35) using a random-effects model. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses also indicated inverse associations, although the substantial heterogeneity did not appear to decrease. Conclusions: The results support the possibility of an adverse effect of high fluoride exposure on children's neurodevelopment. Future research should include detailed individual-level information on prenatal exposure, neurobehavioral performance, and covariates for adjustment.

84869877576	Effects of exogenous methionine on arsenic burden and NO metabolism in brain of mice exposed to arsenite through drinking water	The aim of this study was to explore the effects of exogenous methionine (Met) on arsenic burden and metabolism of nitric oxide (NO) in the brain of mice exposed to arsenite via drinking water. Mice were exposed to sodium arsenite through drinking water contaminated with 50 mg/L arsenic for four consecutive weeks, and treated intraperitoneally with saline solution, 100 mg/kg body weight (b.w), 200 mg/kg b.w or 400 mg/kg b.w of Met, respectively at the fourth week. Levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsenic acid (MMAs), and dimethylarsenic acid (DMAs) in the liver, blood and brain were determined by method of hydride generation coupled with atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities and NO levels in the brain were determined by colorimetric method. Compared with mice exposed to arsenite alone, administration of Met increased significantly the primary methylation ratio in the liver, which resulted in decrease of percent iAs and increase of percent DMAs in the liver, and decrease of iAs, MMAs and total arsenic levels (TAs) in the blood and DMAs and TAs in the brain. NOS activities and NO levels in the brain of mice exposed to arsenite alone were significantly lower than those in control, however administration of Met could increase significantly NO levels. Findings from this study suggested that exogenous Met could benefit the primary arsenic methylation in the liver, which might increase the production of methylated arsenicals and facilitate arsenic excretion. As a consequence, arsenic burden in both blood and brain was reduced, and toxic effects on NO metabolism in the brain were ameliorated. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84870302408	Sulforaphane prevents pulmonary damage in response to inhaled arsenic by activating the Nrf2-defense response	Exposure to arsenic is associated with an increased risk of lung disease. Novel strategies are needed to reduce the adverse health effects associated with arsenic exposure in the lung. Nrf2, a transcription factor that mediates an adaptive cellular defense response, is effective in detoxifying environmental insults and prevents a broad spectrum of diseases induced by environmental exposure to harmful substances. In this report, we tested whether Nrf2 activation protects mice from arsenic-induced toxicity. We used an in vivo arsenic inhalation model that is highly relevant to low environmental human exposure to arsenic-containing dusts. Two-week exposure to arsenic-containing dust resulted in pathological alterations, oxidative DNA damage, and mild apoptotic cell death in the lung; all of which were blocked by sulforaphane (SF) in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Mechanistically, SF-mediated activation of Nrf2 alleviated inflammatory responses by modulating cytokine production. This study provides strong evidence that dietary intervention targeting Nrf2 activation is a feasible approach to reduce adverse health effects associated with arsenic exposure. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84870940947	Effects of arsenite in astrocytes on neuronal signaling transduction	The main purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that arsenite induces neurotoxicity via effects on astrocytes. Astrocytes were exposed to 0, 5 or 10 μM arsenite in medium for 24. h, and then astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) was collected after incubation with fresh medium for 6. h. Primary neuron cultures were divided into four groups due to ACM, which were neurons without ACM exposure (group I) and neurons exposed to ACM from 0, 5 or 10 μM arsenite treated astrocytes (group II-IV). Protein expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NR1, NR2A, NR2B), calmodulin-dependent protein kinaseII (CaMKII) and adenylate cyclase (AC) in neurons were measured after incubation with ACM for 4, 8 or 12. h. Morphological changes and synaptic formation were observed after a 72. h-incubation with ACM. Compared to group II, synaptic formation and protein expression of NR2A, NR2B, CaMKII and AC in group III and IV were significantly suppressed. Moreover, synaptic formation and protein expression of CaMKII and AC in group II were significantly enhanced when compared with group I. Taken together, findings from this study suggested that arsenic in astrocytes might impair synaptic formation through disturbing astrocytic effects on neuronal signal transduction. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84874561302	Sodium arsenite induces cyclooxygenase-2 expression in human uroepithelial cells through MAPK pathway activation and reactive oxygen species induction	Arsenic can induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to oxidative stress and carcinogenesis. Bladder is one of the major target organs of arsenic, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) may play an important role in arsenic-induced bladder cancer. However, the mechanism by which arsenic induces COX-2 in bladder cells remains unclear. This study aimed at investigating arsenic-mediated intracellular redox status and signaling cascades leading to COX-2 induction in human uroepithelial cells (SV-HUC-1). SV-HUC-1 cells were exposed to sodium arsenite and COX-2 expression, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, glutathione (GSH) levels, ROS induction and Nrf2 expression were quantified. Our results demonstrate that arsenite (1-10. μM) elevates COX-2 expression, GSH levels, ROS and Nrf2 expression. Arsenite treatment for 24. h stimulates phosphorylation of ERK and p38, but not JNK in SV-HUC-1 cells. Induction of Cox-2 mRNA levels by arsenite was attenuated by inhibitors of ERK, p38 and JNK. Arsenite-induced ROS generation and COX-2 expression were significantly attenuated by treatment with melatonin (a ROS scavenger), but enhanced by DL-buthionine-(S, R)-sulfoximine (BSO, an inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) resulting in lower GSH and increased ROS levels). These data indicate that arsenite promotes an induction of ROS, which results in an induction of COX-2 expression through activation of the MAPK pathway. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84874597689	Geographical Distribution of MTHFR C677T, A1298C and MTRR A66G Gene Polymorphisms in China: Findings from 15357 Adults of Han Nationality	Background: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, A1298C and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) A66G polymorphisms are important genetic determinants for homocysteine (Hcy) levels, and are associated with several disorders. These polymorphisms are heterogeneously distributed worldwide. Our objective was to explore the geographical distributions of these polymorphisms in China. Methodologies: 15357 healthy adults were recruited from 10 regions. Buccal samples were collected and genomic DNA was isolated. Genotyping was performed using the fluorogenic 5′-nuclease assay. Principal Findings: The prevalence of the three polymorphisms among different populations from China varied significantly and showed apparent geographical gradients. For MTHFR C677T, the frequencies of the 677T allele and the 677TT genotype were significantly higher among northern populations and ranged from the lowest values (24.0% and 6.4%, respectively) in Hainan (southern) to the highest values (63.1% and 40.8%, respectively) in Shandong (northern). For MTHFR A1298C, the 1298C allele and the 1298CC genotype frequencies were significantly higher among southern populations and increased from low values (13.1% and 1.4%, respectively) in Shandong to high values (25.7% and 6.7%, respectively) in Hainan. For A66G, the 66G allele and the 66GG genotype frequencies increased from lower values (23.7% and 5.4%, respectively) in Shandong to higher values (29.2% and 8.6%, respectively) in Hainan. The overall frequency of the 677T allele, 677TT genotype, 1298C allele, 1298CC genotype, 66G allele and 66GG genotype in the Chinese Han population was 45.2%, 23.2%, 18.6%, 3.9%, 25.7%, and 6.6%, respectively. No gender differences were found in the prevalence of both the MTHFR C677T and MTRR A66G polymorphisms. Conclusions: This study indicates that there are marked geographical variations in the prevalence of the three polymorphisms among Chinese Han populations. Our baseline data may be useful for future researches in related fields. © 2013 Yang et al.

84876433093	Arsenic methylation metabolism and liver injury of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients undergoing arsenic trioxide treatment	Although arsenic is effective in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), as a well-known environmental toxicant, the side effects of arsenic treatment and arsenic methylation metabolism of the patients are rarely reported. In this manuscript, we investigated 23 APL patients treated with 10 mg arsenic trioxide daily, detected the arsenic metabolites in urine samples collected on the 0, 10th, and 20th day of arsenic treatment. At the same time, liver function and blood routine examination were also investigated in these APL patients. We found that, urinary monomethylated arsenic proportion (MMA%) increased, but dimethylated arsenic proportion (DMA%), the first methylation ratio (FMR) and the secondary methylation ratio (SMR) decreased with consecutive administration of arsenic trioxide. After adjustment for age impact, no statistical difference was observed in urinary arsenic concentrations and arsenic methylation capacity between male and female at the same treatment time point. During arsenic trioxide treatment of APL, transient elevation of serum aminotransferases was found in the blood samples, which indicated that liver injury occurred and probably reversible. Leukocytosis developed in 5 of the 23 patients with the administration of arsenic trioxide. No statistical difference was observed in the other blood routine examination parameters. These results demonstrated that the capacity of arsenic methylation decreased and transient liver injury occurred during arsenic trioxide treatment of APL, which indicated that the side effects of clinical arsenic treatment can not be ignored. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84878705896	Activation of the Nrf2 pathway by inorganic arsenic in human hepatocytes and the role of transcriptional repressor bach1	Previous studies have proved that the environmental toxicant, inorganic arsenic, activates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway in many different cell types. This study tried to explore the hepatic Nrf2 pathway upon arsenic treatment comprehensively, since liver is one of the major target organs of arsenical toxicity. Our results showed that inorganic arsenic significantly induced Nrf2 protein and mRNA expression in Chang human hepatocytes. We also observed a dose-dependent increase of antioxidant response element- (ARE-) luciferase activity. Both the mRNA and protein levels of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were all upregulated dramatically. On the other hand, entry and accumulation of Nrf2 protein in the nucleus, while exportting the transcriptional repressor BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1) from nucleus to cytoplasm, were also confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Our results therefore confirmed the arsenic-induced Nrf2 pathway activation in hepatocytes and also suggested that the translocation of Bach1 was associated with the regulation of Nrf2 pathway by arsenic. Hepatic Nrf2 pathway plays indispensable roles for cellular defenses against arsenic hepatotoxicity, and the interplay of Bach1 and Nrf2 may be helpful to understand the self-defensive responses and the diverse biological effects of arsenicals. © 2013 Dan Liu et al.

84878896207	Induction of immune tolerance and reduction of aggravated lung eosinophilia by co-exposure to Asian sand dust and ovalbumin for 14 weeks in mice	Background: Atmospheric contamination caused by Asian sand-dust (ASD) storms aggravates asthma in both human adults and children. This study aims to investigate a series of manifestations in allergic airway disease caused by co-exposure to allergens and ASD for 6 weeks and 14 weeks. Methods: CD-1 Mice were instilled intratracheally with 0.1 mg of ASD/mouse four times (6 weeks) or eight times (14 weeks) at 2-week intervals (total dose of 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg/mouse) with or without ovalbumin (OVA). The pathologic changes in the airway, cytological alteration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in BALF, and OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 antibodies in serum were measured in the treated CD-1 mice. Results: Four-time co-exposure to OVA and ASD aggravates allergic airway inflammation along with Th2-cytokine IL-13 and eosinophil-relevant cytokine/chemokines IL-5, Eotaxin and MCP-3 in BALF, and fibrous thickening of the subepithelial layer in the airway. On the other hand, eight-time co-exposure attenuates these changes along with a significant increase of TGF-β1 in BALF. Adjuvant effects of ASD toward IgG1 and IgE production in sera were, however, still seen in the eight-time co-exposure. Conclusions: These results indicate that the immune responses in airways are exacerbated by four-time co-exposure to ASD with OVA, but that there is a shift to suppressive responses in eight-time co-exposure, suggesting that the responses are caused by TGF-β1-related immune tolerance. © 2013 He et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84879600996	Sodium arsenite induced reactive oxygen species generation, nuclear factor (erythroid-2 related) factor 2 activation, heme oxygenase-1 expression, and glutathione elevation in Chang human hepatocytes	Liver is one of the major target organs of arsenic toxicity and carcinogenesis. Nuclear factor (erythroid-2 related) factor 2 (Nrf2) is a redox-sensitive transcription factor, regulating critically cellular defense responses against the toxic metallic arsenic in many cell types and tissues. This study was conducted to evaluate the hepato-cellular Nrf2 and Nrf2-regulated antioxidant reactions of sodium arsenite exposure in Chang human hepatocytes. Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein levels were detected by Western blot, and Nrf2-regulated HO-1 mRNA expressions were determined using semiquantitative RT-PCR by 0∼50 μmol/L of sodium arsenite exposure for 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. We also observed the changes of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and total cellular glutathione (GSH) by flow cytometry and spectrophotometry, respectively. Our results showed that intracellular ROS were both dose- and time-dependent induced by inorganic arsenic; Cellular Nrf2 protein levels increased rapidly after 2 h of exposure, elevated significantly at 6 h, and reached the maximum at 12 h. The endogenous Nrf2-regulated downstream HO-1 mRNA and protein were also induced dramatically and lasted for as long as 24 h. In addition, intracellular GSH levels elevated in consistent with Nrf2 activation. Our findings here suggest that inorganic arsenic alters cellular redox balance in hepatocytes to trigger Nrf2-regulated antioxidant responses promptly, which may represent an adaptive cell defense mechanism against inorganic arsenic induced liver injuries and hepatoxicity. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84881291096	Curcumin attenuates arsenic-induced hepatic injuries and oxidative stress in experimental mice through activation of Nrf2 pathway, promotion of arsenic methylation and urinary excretion	Oxidative stress is one of the major mechanisms implicated in inorganic arsenic poisoning. Curcumin is a natural phenolic compound with impressive antioxidant properties. What's more, curcumin is recently proved to exert its chemopreventive effects partly through the activation of nuclear factor (erythroid-2 related) factor 2 (Nrf2) and its antioxidant and phase II detoxifying enzymes. In vivo, we investigated the protective effects of curcumin against arsenic-induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative injuries. Our results showed that arsenic-induced elevation of serum alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, augmentation of hepatic malonaldehyde (MDA), as well as the reduction of blood and hepatic glutathione (GSH) levels, were all consistently relieved by curcumin. We also observed the involvement of curcumin in promoting arsenic methylation and urinary elimination in vivo. Furthermore, both the hepatic Nrf2 protein and two typically recognized Nrf2 downstream genes, NADP(H) quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), were consistently up-regulated in curcumin-treated mice. Our study confirmed the antagonistic roles of curcumin to counteract inorganic arsenic-induced hepatic toxicity in vivo, and suggested that the potent Nrf2 activation capability might be valuable for the protective effects of curcumin against arsenic intoxication. This provides a potential useful chemopreventive dietary component for human populations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84882765223	Groundwater arsenic contamination throughout China	Arsenic-contaminated groundwater used for drinking in China is a health threat that was first recognized in the 1960s. However, because of the sheer size of the country, millions of groundwater wells remain to be tested in order to determine the magnitude of the problem. We developed a statistical risk model that classifies safe and unsafe areas with respect to geogenic arsenic contamination in China, using the threshold of 10 micrograms per liter, the World Health Organization guideline and current Chinese standard for drinking water. We estimate that 19.6 million people are at risk of being affected by the consumption of arsenic-contaminated groundwater. Although the results must be confirmed with additional field measurements, our risk model identifies numerous arsenic-affected areas and highlights the potential magnitude of this health threat in China.

84884276328	JNK and NADPH oxidase involved in fluoride-induced oxidative stress in BV-2 microglia cells	Excessive fluoride may cause central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and oxidative stress is a recognized mode of action of fluoride toxicity. In CNS, activated microglial cells can release more reactive oxygen species (ROS), and NADPH oxidase (NOX) is the major enzyme for the production of extracellular superoxide in microglia. ROS have been characterized as an important secondary messenger and modulator for various mammalian intracellular signaling pathways, including the MAPK pathways. In this study we examined ROS production and TNF-α, IL-1β inflammatory cytokines releasing, and the expression of MAPKs in BV-2 microglia cells treated with fluoride. We found that fluoride increased JNK phosphorylation level of BV-2 cells and pretreatment with JNK inhibitor SP600125 markedly reduced the levels of intracellular O2·- and NO. NOX inhibitor apocynin and iNOS inhibitor SMT dramatically decreased NaF-induced ROS and NO generations, respectively. Antioxidant melatonin (MEL) resulted in a reduction in JNK phosphorylation in fluoride-stimulated BV-2 microglia. The results confirmed that NOX and iNOS played an important role in fluoride inducing oxidative stress and NO production and JNK took part in the oxidative stress induced by fluoride and meanwhile also could be activated by ROS in fluoride-treated BV-2 cells. © 2013 Ling Yan et al.

84885908203	Prolonged environmental exposure of arsenic through drinking water on the risk of hypertension and type 2 diabetes	Prolonged exposure to inorganic arsenic has been a severe environmental public health issue worldwide in the recent decades. Increasing evidence has suggested a possible role of prolonged arsenic exposure through drinking water in the development of arsenic-induced chronic noncancer diseases, among which hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are the focus of concern. Although exposure to high levels of arsenic has been reported to be associated with excess risk of hypertension or T2D in a dose-dependent manner, the association has yet to be established, especially low-level exposure. This cross-sectional study was designed to evaluate the potential association between prolonged environmental arsenic exposure through drinking water and the prevalence of hypertension and T2D in Inner Mongolia, China, with emphasis on the assessment of low-level exposure. In this study (a total of 669 men and women), we found that the blood pressure levels were significantly correlated with cumulative arsenic exposure and that the systolic blood pressure of the subjects with arsenic exposure >50 μg/L was significantly higher than those of the subjects with <10 and 10-50 μg/L exposure. Significant prevalence of hypertension was found in the subjects of the >50 μg/L group both before and after adjustment for confounders. In addition, a significant negative relationship was found between urinary arsenic percentage of dimethylated arsenic (DMA%) and the prevalence of hypertension in the >50 μg/L group. However, low-level arsenic exposure (10-50 μg/L) was not statistically associated with hypertension. No significant difference of blood glucose was found among the groups with different arsenic exposure levels. No statistical association was found between arsenic exposure and T2D. Our findings suggested that prolonged arsenic exposure might play a role in the development of hypertension; however, only high-level arsenic was associated with the risk of hypertension. Our findings also indicated that lower DMA% might be related with the increased susceptibility of arsenic-induced hypertension. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84890319500	Fluoride promotes osteoblastic differentiation through canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway	Although fluoride is known to stimulate bone formation, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Recent studies have implicated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a major signaling cascade in bone biology. Our earlier studies highlighted a probable role of canonical Wnt pathway in bone formation of chronic fluoride-exposed rats, but the mechanism remains unclear. The current study determined the involvement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in fluoride-induced osteoblastic differentiation. Using primary rat osteoblasts, we demonstrated that fluoride significantly promoted osteoblasts proliferation and alkaline phosphate (ALP) expression as well as the mRNA expression levels of bone differentiation markers, including type I collagen (COL1A1), ALP and osteonectin. We further found fluoride induced phosphorylations at serine 473 of Akt and serine 9 of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), which resulted in GSK-3β inhibition and subsequently the nuclear accumulation of the β-catenin, as shown by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. Moreover, fluoride also induced the expression of Wnt-targeted gene runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). Importantly, the positive effect of fluoride on ALP activity and mRNA expressions of COL1A1, ALP, osteonection and Runx2 was abolished by DKK-1, a blocker of the Wnt/β-catenin receptor. Taken together, these findings suggest that fluoride promotes osteoblastic differentiation through Akt- and GSK-3β-dependent activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in primary rat osteoblasts. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of action of fluoride in osteoblastogenesis. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84890786348	The factors influencing urinary arsenic excretion and metabolism of workers in steel and iron smelting foundry	In order to evaluate the degree of arsenic (As) exposure and the factors influencing urinary As excretion and metabolism, 192 workers from a steel and iron smelting plant, with different type of work in production such as roller, steel smelting, iron smelting and metallic charge preparation, were recruited. Information about characteristics of each subject was obtained by questionnaire and inorganic As (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in urine were determined. The results showed that steel smelters had significantly higher concentrations of DMA and total As (TAs) than rollers and metallic charge preparation workers, and iron and steel smelters had a higher value of primary methylation index and lower proportion of the iAs (iAs%) than rollers and metallic charge preparation workers. In steel smelters, urinary As level exceeded the biological exposure index (BEI) limit for urinary As of 35 μg/l by 65.52%, and higher than metallic charge preparation workers (35.14%). The individuals consumed seafood in recent 3 days had a higher TAs than the individuals without seafood consumption. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that different jobs, taken Chinese medicine of bezoar and seafood consumption in recent 3 days were significantly associated with urinary TAs exceeded BEI limit value 35 μg/l. Our results suggest that workers in steel and iron smelting plant had a lower level of As exposure, and seafood consumption and taking Chinese medicine of bezoar also could increase the risk of urinary TAs exceeded BEI limit value. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.

84893706599	Lung inflammation by fungus, Bjerkandera adusta isolated from Asian sand dust (ASD) aerosol and enhancement of ovalbumin-induced lung eosinophilia by ASD and the fungus in mice	Background: Bjerkandera adusta (B. adusta) is one of the most important etiological fungi associated with chronic cough. However, precise details of the inflammatory response to exposure are not well understood yet. B. adusta was recently identified in Asian sand dust (ASD) aerosol. Therefore, in the present study the exacerbating effects of ASD on B. adusta-induced lung inflammation and B. adusta + ASD on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced murine lung eosinophilia were investigated using experimental mice.Methods: In order to prepare testing samples, B. adusta obtained from ASD aerosol was inactivated by formalin and ASD collected from the atmosphere was heated to remove toxic organic substances (H-ASD). CD-1 mice were instilled intratracheally with 12 different samples prepared with various combinations of B. adusta, H-ASD, and OVA in a normal saline solution. The lung pathology, cytological profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and the levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in BALF were investigated.Results: H-ASD aggravated the lung eosinophilia induced by B. adusta alone, which also aggravated the lung eosinophilia induced by OVA. The mixture of OVA, H-ASD, and B. adusta caused serious fibrous thickening of the subepithelial layer, eosinophil infiltration, and proliferation of goblet cells in the airways along with remarkable increases of IL-13, eotaxin, IL-5, and MCP-3 in BALF.Conclusions: The results of the present study demonstrated that B. adusta isolated from ASD aerosol induces allergic lung diseases. H-ASD enhanced allergic reactions caused by OVA or B. adusta. A mixture of B. adusta, H-ASD, and OVA caused the most remarkable exacerbation to the allergic airway inflammation via remarkable increases of pro-inflammatory mediators. © 2014 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84895550128	Associations of MTHFR gene polymorphisms with hypertension and hypertension in pregnancy: A meta-analysis from 114 studies with 15411 cases and 21970 controls	Background: Several epidemiological studies have investigated the associations of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C polymorphisms with hypertension (H) or hypertension in pregnancy (HIP). However, the results were controversial. We therefore performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to provide empirical evidences on the associations. Methodologies: The English and Chinese databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the strength of the associations. Meta-regression, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, cumulative meta-analysis and assessment of publication bias were performed in our study. Principal Findings: A total of 114 studies with 15411 cases and 21970 controls were included, 111 studies with 15094 cases and 21633 controls for the C677T polymorphism and 21 with 2533 cases and 2976 controls for the A1298C polymorphism. Overall, the C677T polymorphism was significantly associated with H and HIP (H & HIP: OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.17-1.34; H: OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.20-1.53; HIP: OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.08-1.32). Stratified analysis by ethnicity revealed a significant association among East Asians and Caucasians, but not among Latinos, Black Africans, and Indians and Sri Lankans. In the stratified analyses according to source of controls, genotyping method, sample size and study quality, significant associations were observed in all the subgroups, with the exception of population based subgroup in H studies and large sample size and "others" genotyping method subgroups in HIP studies. For the A1298C polymorphism, no significant association was observed either in overall or subgroup analysis under all genetic models. Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that the MTHFR C677T rather than A1298C polymorphism may be associated with H & HIP, especially among East Asians and Caucasians. © 2014 Yang et al.

84896537760	Relationship between the actual test results of groundwater arsenic level and the predictions of a geographic information system model in four provinces of Huaihe River Basin	Objective To test the accuracy of predicted results by a geographic information system GIS model with the actual distribution of groundwater arsenic concentration in four provinces including Shandong, Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu of Huaihe River Basin. Methods The results of groundwater arsenic level of the four provinces in Huaihe River Basin were cited as the data resource; after stratified by arsenic in water, water arsenic > 0.01 mg/L as statistical standards, the number of villages and counties (districts) with arsenic level higher than the standards was calculated. Meanwhile, locations of counties (districts) sampled on the map of GIS predictive model were marked; the gray level of arsenic contaminated probability 0.3 was regarded as the criterion and the consistence of both results predicted by GIS model and detected actually in each province was analyzed. Results A total of 61 824 wells distributed in 2 781 villages around the four provinces of Huaihe River Basin were sampled, and 474 of the 2 781 villages were confirmed as high arsenic villages ( arsenic > 0.01 mg/L), with an average detection rate of 17.04%(474/2 781). The detection rates of high arsenic villages in Shandong, Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu were 13.19%(79/599), 23.82%( 101/424), 74.25%(199/268) and 6.38%(95/1 490), respectively, and the differences of detection rates among the provinces were statistically significant (x

84900424582	Joint effects of urinary arsenic methylation capacity with potential modifiers on arsenicosis: A cross-sectional study from an endemic arsenism area in Huhhot Basin, northern China	A lower arsenic methylation capacity is believed to be associated with various arsenic-related diseases. However, the synergistic effect of the arsenic methylation capacity and potential modifiers on arsenicosis risk is unclear. The current study evaluated the joint effect of the arsenic methylation capacity with several risk factors on the risk of arsenicosis characterized by skin lesions. In total, 302 adults (79 arsenicosis and 223 non-arsenicosis) residing in an endemic arsenism area in Huhhot Basin were included. Urinary levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were determined, and the percentages of arsenic species (iAs%, MMA%, and DMA%), as well as two methylation indices (primary methylation index, PMI, and secondary methylation index, SMI), were calculated to assess the arsenic methylation capacity of individuals. The results showed that a lower methylation capacity, which is indicated by higher MMA% values and lower DMA% and SMI values, was significantly associated with arsenicosis after the adjustment for multiple confounders. The relative excess risk for interactions between higher MMA% values and older age was 2.35 (95% CI: -0.56, 5.27), and the relative excess risk for interactions between higher MMA% values and lower BMI was 1.08 (95% CI: -1.20, 3.36). The data also indicated a suggestive synergistic effect of a lower arsenic methylation capacity (lower DMA% and SMI) with older age, lower BMI, and male gender. The findings of the present study suggest that a lower arsenic methylation capacity was associated with arsenicosis and that certain risk factors may enhance the risk of arsenic-induced skin lesions. © 2014.

84900563672	The association between passive smoking and type 2 diabetes: A meta-analysis	The number of people with diabetes has been exponentially increasing. A number of reports in the literature have suggested that exposure to passive smoke may play a key role in the development of diabetes; however, the association has not been jointly summarized yet. In this meta-analysis, 2 databases were searched to identify studies, and the references of these studies were scanned for further studies. Fourteen studies on the relationship between passive smoking and diabetes were included. After all the studies were pooled, the results showed that passive smoking was significantly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in a random model. The subgroup analysis results were consistent with overall results regardless of type of study design, age, gender, adjustment of dependent variables, area, or study quality. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the overall results were reliable. There was no publication bias observed in the selected studies. © 2014 APJPH.

84904627048	Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism and type 2 diabetes mellitus in Chinese population: A meta-analysis of 29 case-control studies	Background: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a key enzyme in folate metabolism, had significant effects on the homocysteine levels. The common functional MTHFR C677T polymorphism had been extensively researched. Several studies had evaluated the relationship between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the results were still controversial in the Chinese Han population. This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and T2DM in the Chinese Han population. Methods: We searched the relevant studies in multiple electronic databases, which published up to December 2013. We reviewed and extracted data from all the included studies on the relationship between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and T2DM in the Chinese Han population. The odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were used to evaluate the relationship. Fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analysis were used to pool ORs by the heterogeneity. Publication bias and sensitivity analysis were also examined. Results: 29 studies were finally included in our meta-analysis, which contained 4656 individuals with T2DM and 2127 healthy controls. There was a significant relationship between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and T2DM under dominant (OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.42-2.02), recessive (OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.21-1.80), homozygous (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.47-2.42), heterozygous (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.33-1.87), and additive (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.28-1.68) genetic model in a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis also reached similar results. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the overall result were dependable. Conclusions: There was a significant relationship between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and T2DM in the Chinese Han population. The results of our meta-analysis suggested that MTHFR 677T allele might be a risk genetic factor of T2DM in the Chinese Han population. © 2014 Zhu et al.

84904299757	Tert-butylhydroquinone as a phenolic activator of Nrf2 antagonizes arsenic-induced oxidative cytotoxicity but promotes arsenic methylation and detoxication in human hepatocyte cell line	Oxidative stress plays crucial roles in exerting a variety of damages upon arsenic exposure. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a master transcriptional regulator protecting cells and tissues from oxidative injuries. The objective of this study was to test whether tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), a well-known synthetic Nrf2 inducer, could protect human hepatocytes against arsenic-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative injuries. Our results showed that 5 and 25 μmol/l tBHQ pretreatment suppressed the arsenic-induced hepatocellular cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species generation, and hepatic lipid peroxidation, while relieved the arsenic-induced disturbances of intracellular glutathione balance. In addition, we also observed that tBHQ treatment promoted the arsenic biomethylation process and upregulated Nrf2-regulated downstream heme oxygenase-1 and NADPH: quinine oxidoreductase 1 mRNA expressions. Collectively, we suspected that Nrf2 signaling pathway may be involved in the protective effects of tBHQ against arsenic invasion in hepatocytes. These data suggest that phenolic Nrf2 inducers, such as tBHQ, represent novel therapeutic or dietary candidates for the population at high risk of arsenic poisoning. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

84904480148	Differences of urinary arsenic metabolites and methylation capacity between individuals with and without skin lesions in Inner Mongolia, Northern China	Incomplete arsenic (As) methylation has been considered a risk factor of As-related diseases. This study aimed to examine the difference of urinary As metabolites and the methylation capacity between subjects with and without skin lesions. Urinary inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were analyzed. The percentage of each As species (iAs%, MMA%, and DMA%), the primary methylation index (PMI) and secondary methylation index (SMI) were calculated. The results showed that subjects with skin lesions have higher levels of urinary iAs (99.08 vs. 70.63 μg/g Cr, p = 0.006) and MMA (69.34 vs. 42.85 μg/g Cr, p = 0.016) than subjects without skin lesions after adjustment for several confounders. Significant differences of urianry MMA% (15.49 vs. 12.11, p = 0.036) and SMI (0.74 vs. 0.81, p = 0.025) were found between the two groups. The findings of the present study suggest that subjects with skin lesions may have a lower As methylation capacity than subjects without skin lesions. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84905592243	Effect of realgar on extracellular amino acid neurotransmitters in hippocampal CA1 region determined by online microdialysis-dansyl chloride derivatization-high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection	An online microdialysis (MD)-dansyl chloride (Dns) derivatization-high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fluorescence detection (FD) system was developed for simultaneous determination of eight extracellular amino acid neurotransmitters in hippocampus. The MD probe was implanted in hippocampal CA1 region. Dialysate and Dns were online mixed and derivatized. The derivatives were separated on an ODS column and detected by FD. The developed online system showed good linearity, precision, accuracy and recovery. This online MD-HPLC system was applied to monitor amino acid neurotransmitters levels in rats exposed to realgar (0.3, 0.9 and 2.7g/kg body weight). The result shows that glutamate concentrations were significantly increased (p<0.05) in hippocampal CA1 region of rats exposed to three doses of realgar. A decrease in γ-aminobutyric acid concentrations was found in rats exposed to medium and high doses of realgar (p<0.05). Elevation of excitotoxic index (EI) values in hippocampal CA1 region of realgar-exposed rats was observed (p<0.05). Positive correlation was found between EI values and arsenic contents in hippocampus of realgar-exposed rats, which indicates that the change in extracellular EI values is associated with arsenic accumulation in hippocampus. The developed online MD-Dns derivatization-HPLC-FD system provides a new experimental method for studying the effect of toxic Chinese medicines on amino acid neurotransmitters. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84910655900	Arsenic induced overexpression of inflammatory cytokines based on the human urothelial cell model in vitro and urinary secretion of individuals chronically exposed to arsenic	Chronic persistent inflammation could play an important role in the pathogenesis of some malignancies, and inflammation is a critical factor for bladder cancer development. In this study, we measured urine levels of transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-8 in arsenic exposure workers and expressions of inflammatory cytokines in human urothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. We found the concentrations of IL-8, TNF-α, and TGF-α presented in urine were significantly elevated in the high urinary arsenic workers compared with the low urinary arsenic workers. Multiple regression analysis showed that the urinary IL-8 level was significantly positively associated with urinary iAs concentration after adjusting for the confounding effects of age, employed years, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol, and seafood consumption in recent 3 days. Urinary TNF-α and TGF-α levels were also significantly positively associated with urinary iAs concentration, and SMI. TGF-α level was negatively associated with age after adjusting for the confounding effects. Consistent with the results in vivo, mRNA expressions of TNF-α, TGF-α, and IL-8 and protein expressions of TGF-α, TGF-β1, and IL-8 were significantly elevated in SV-HUC-1 cells after exposure to lower concentrations of arsenite for 24h as compared to the control group. These data indicated that arsenic increased the secretion of inflammatory factors and IL-8, TNF-α, and TGF-α expression may be a useful biomarker of the effect of arsenic exposure.

84912118665	Associations of MTHFR C677T and MTRR A66G gene polymorphisms with metabolic syndrome: A case-control study in northern China	Prior evidence indicates that homocysteine plays a role in the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) A66G polymorphisms are common genetic determinants of homocysteine levels. To investigate the associations of the MTHFR C677T and MTRR A66G polymorphisms with MetS, 692 Chinese Han subjects with MetS and 878 controls were recruited. The component traits of MetS and the MTHFR C677T and MTRR A66G genotypes were determined. A significant association was observed between the MTHFR 677T allele and increased risk of MetS, high fasting blood glucose, high waist circumference, and increasing number of MetS components. The MTRR A66G polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of MetS when combined with the MTHFR 677TT genotype, although there was no association found between MetS and MTRR A66G alone. Furthermore, the MTRR 66GG genotype was associated with high fasting blood glucose and triglycerides. Our data suggest that the MTHFR 677T allele may contribute to an increased risk of MetS in the northern Chinese Han population. The MTRR A66G polymorphism is not associated with MetS. However, it may exacerbate the effect of the MTHFR C677T variant alone. Further large prospective population-based studies are required to confirm our findings.

10744228609	A potential mechanism for the impairment of nitric oxide formation caused by prolonged oral exposure to arsenate in rabbits	We have recently found evidence for impairment of nitric oxide (NO) formation and induction of oxidative stress in residents of an endemic area of chronic arsenic poisoning in Inner Mongolia, China. To investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for these phenomena, a subchronic animal experiment was conducted using male New Zealand White rabbits. After 18 weeks of continuous exposure of rabbits to 5 mg/l of arsenate in drinking water, a significant decrease in systemic NO production occurred, as shown by significantly reduced plasma NO metabolites levels (76% of control) and a tendency towards decreased serum cGMP levels (81.4% of control). On the other hand, increased oxidative stress, as shown by significantly increased urinary hydrogen peroxide (H
