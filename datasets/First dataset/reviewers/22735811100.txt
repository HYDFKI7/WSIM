0005058627	Frequency analysis of a parallel flat plate-type structure in still water, part I: A multi-span beam	This paper is part I of a two part paper. The model used in part I is a multi-span wide beam in water contained by a rigid water trough. The multi-span beam is used to imitate a typical substructure of a parallel flat plate-type structure. There exists a narrow channel between the lower surface of the wide beam and the upper surface of the bottom plate of the water trough. By using the small parameter expansion method, the added mass and damping coefficients for a typical cross-section of a plate-fluid-plate system are deduced. Moreover, by means of the added water mass and damping coefficients, the free vibration frequencies of the simple model of a multi-span wide beam are analyzed in the first part of the paper. In the second part of this paper, the free vibration frequencies of a complex model of a parallel flat plate-type structure will be analyzed. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.

0030646360	Effects of geometrical asymmetries of structure on dynamical characteristics of two coupled control surfaces	The dynamical characteristics of two coupled control surfaces with structural asymmetries are studied. The results show that a first order and a second order perturbation method can be applied to predict free vibration frequencies and modal shapes accurately. If the stiffness value of the operational system (or asymmetrical degree) is large enough, a small asymmetrical parameter can lead to the vibration isolation of one control surface, which means that the vibrating amplitudes of one control surface are large, but those of the other control surface are close to zero. In order to avoid such vibration isolation of control surfaces, the operation stiffness (or the asymmetrical degree) must be decreased as far as possible in the structural designs of two coupled control surfaces. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.

30244443516	Frequency analysis of a parallel flat plate-type structure in still water, part II: A complex structure	This paper is part II of a two part paper. The model used in this part is a parallel flat plate-type structure in a rigid water trough or rigid rectangular tube. A narrow channel exists between any two adjacent plates of the structure. The motion equations of the plate-type structure vibrating in water are obtained by extending the method for a typical cross-section of plate-fluid-plate system presented in the first part of this paper. The computational frequencies of the structure vibrating both in air and in water are compared with those measured by a resonance test. The results show that the local frequencies of the minor plate-type beams of the structure decrease much more strongly than those of the structure vibrating in water. Moreover, the varying tendency of frequencies of the structure with two different water boundary conditions is discussed.

33847766122	Characteristic equation approach to stability measures of linear neutral systems with multiple time delays	Using the characteristic equation approach, the problem of asymptotic stability of linear neutral systems with multiple time delays is investigated in this paper. New delay-independent stability criteria are derived in terras of the spectral radius of corresponding modulus matrices. The structure information of the system matrices are taken into consideration in the proposed stability criteria, thus the conservatism found in the literature can be significantly reduced. The explicit nature of the construction permits us to directly express the algebraic criteria in terms of the plant parameters, thus checking of stability by our criteria can be carried out rather simply. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the new criteria and to compare them with the previous results.

80052284507	Bifurcation and responses analysis of two-dimension panel with external excitation in subsonic flow	Along with the development of high speed multiple unite train and intercity railroad, the high speed technology has become the development direction of train. With the increase of speed, the aerodynamic problems of such train are emerging, while neglected in low speed. Future trains will increase their speeds substantially, and if so, aerodynamic forces may influence train running safety and affect passenger's comfort. So the aeroelasticity of high speed train is the problem to be urgently and promptly solved. Because the high speed train adopts stream line design to decrease running resistance, lots of panel structures such as body skin are widely used. When train runs with lower speed, these panel structures will vibrate with small amplitude and can not be inhibited at all. But under combined aerodynamic forces and wheel-rail excitation, complicated aeroelasticity phenomena of these panel structures may occur. The bifurcation and responses of two-dimension panel with external excitation in subsonic flow are studied in this paper. Based on the potential theory of incompressible flow, the aerodynamic pressure for air acting on the top side of the panel is acquired. The wheel-rail excitation is simplified as external forcing acting on the panel. The cubic stiffness and viscous damper in middle of the panel are considered. The nonlinear governing motion equations are reduced to a series of ordinary differential equations by the Galerkin method. The Runge-Kutta numerical method is used to conduct numerical simulations. The distribution of non-single period areas of the panel system are indicated in differential parameter planes. The effect of three dimensionless parameters, namely viscous damping coefficient σ, external forcing amplitude β and dynamic pressure increment Δλ, is emphatically investigated. The results of this paper show that the pitchfork bifurcation occurs with the increase of dynamic pressure, and the number and stability of the equilibrium points change after the dynamic pressure exceeds the critical value. In differential single period regions, the system motion trajectories in phase-plane portraits change rhythmically. 1. In the parameter plane σ-β, the number of non-single period regions decreases with the increase of σ; the non-single period regions and single period regions appear alternately with the increase of β. 2. In the parameter plane Δλ-β, the non-single period region number firstly increases and then decreases with the increase of ΔλA; the non-single period regions and single period regions appear alternately with the increase of β. 3. In the parameter plane σ-Δλ, the non-single period regions present asymmetric double-peak structure when Δλ>0; the non-single period region number firstly increases and then decreases with the increase of σ. 4. The route from periodic motion to chaos is via doubling-period bifurcation.

84867098186	On the aeroelastic stability and bifurcation structure of subsonic nonlinear thin panels subjected to external excitation	Dynamic behavior of panels exposed to subsonic flow subjected to external excitation is investigated in this paper. The von Karman's large deflection equations of motion for a flexible panel and Kelvin's model of structural damping is considered to derive the governing equation. The panel under study is two-dimensional and simply supported. A Galerkin-type solution is introduced to derive the unsteady aerodynamic pressure from the linearized potential equation of uniform incompressible flow. The governing partial differential equation is transformed to a series of ordinary differential equations by using Galerkin method. The aeroelastic stability of the linear panel system is presented in a qualitative analysis and numerical study. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta numerical algorithm is used to conduct the numerical simulations to investigate the bifurcation structure of the nonlinear panel system and the distributions of chaotic regions are shown in the different parameter spaces. The results shows that the panel loses its stability by divergence not flutter in subsonic flow; the number of the fixed points and their stabilities change after the dynamic pressure exceeds the critical value; the chaotic regions and periodic regions appear alternately in parameter spaces; the single period motion trajectories change rhythmically in different periodic regions; the route from periodic motion to chaos is via doubling-period bifurcation. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

84876711825	Open reduction and internal fixation versus external fixation for unstable distal radial fractures: A meta-analysis	Purpose: To compare the clinical outcomes of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) versus the ones of closed reduction and external fixation (EF) in the treatment of distal radial fractures. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared the clinical results of ORIF to EF in the treatment of distal radial fractures. A systemic retrieve from PubMed, EMBASE, OVID and Cochrane Collaboration CENTRAL database resulted in 11 studies with 824 patients. We thus performed data synthesis using RevMan (version 5.1). Results: Superior statistical differences were observed for DASH scores (at 3, 6 and 12. months follow-up) grip strength (at 3. months follow-up), volar tilt (at 12. months follow-up), flexion and supination (at 3. months follow-up), and extension (at 3 and 6. months follow-up) in ORIF patients group, compared with those in EF group. We also found a significantly higher risk of infection associated with EF. There was no significant difference in the incidence of malunion and median nerve dysfunction. Conclusion: Regarding surgical fixation of unstable distal radius fractures, ORIF yields significantly better subjective outcome (DASH scores) the first year after operation, restoration of anatomic volar tilt, and forearm flexion and extension at the end of the follow-up period. However, EF results in higher incidence of infection compared to ORIF. ORIF is equal to EF for either grip strength, or range of motion of the injured wrist, or incidence of malunion or median nerve dysfunction at the end of the follow-up period.

Then, the system equilibrium points and their stability were analyzed, and Melnikov's method was used to obtain the critical values of system parameters for chaos appearance. The critical relations between the external excitation amplitude, frequency, and flow velocity were discussed and compared with the results of chaotic motions by numerical simulation. The results show that the number of equilibrium points and their stability will change after the dimensionless dynamic pressure exceeds 64.42, and the critical parameters determined by Melnikov's method match up to those obtained by numerical simulation. Therefore, the proposed method can be used to judge whether the chaotic motion happens or not.

The effects of temperature distribution and panel length-to-width ratio on the flutter of the system are analyzed. The results show that with the rise of temperature the critical dynamic pressures acting on the panel reduce and the stability of system decreases. But the critical dynamic pressure of the panel with uniform temperature distribution is lower than that with sine temperature distribution, which indicates that the thermal effect of the panel with uniform temperature distribution is more pronounced. The results also show that increase in the length-to-width ratio is beneficial to the flutter stability of the panel. With two temperature distributions and different length-to-width ratios of the panel, five types of vibration behavior including flat, limit-cycle, buckled, nonharmonic and chaotic vibrations are shown in the panel system.

65449121935	Chaotic motions and limit cycle flutter of two-dimensional wing in supersonic flow	Based on the piston theory of supersonic flow and the energy method, the flutter motion equations of a two-dimensional wing with cubic stiffness in the pitching direction are established. The aeroelastic system contains both structural and aerodynamic nonlinearities. Hopf bifurcation theory is used to analyze the flutter speed of the system. The effects of system parameters on the flutter speed are studied. The 4th order Runge-Kutta method is used to calculate the stable limit cycle responses and chaotic motions of the aeroelastic system. Results show that the number and the stability of equilibrium points of the system vary with the increase of flow speed. Besides the simple limit cycle response of period 1, there are also period-doubling responses and chaotic motions in the flutter system. The route leading to chaos in the aeroelastic model used here is the period-doubling bifurcation. The chaotic motions in the system occur only when the flow speed is higher than the linear divergent speed and the initial condition is very small. Moreover, the flow speed regions in which the system behaves chaos are very narrow. © 2009 The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.

The aerodynamic force is solved by first-piston theory of supersonic aerodynamics. Aeroelastics differential equations of a three-dimensional panel with thermal effect to atmosphere turbulence are set up by using the Von Karman large deformation strain-displacement relation and Galerkin approach.

The results show that when the mean pressure is close to and over the flutter critical pressure, the mean square root of response of a structure increases with the rise of the mean pressure or temperature. The mean square root of response of the structure has a pronounce change to the strength of atmosphere turbulence only when the mean pressure is close to the flutter critical pressure, but it is insensitive to the change of integral measure of atmosphere turbulence.

Each car in the monorail train was idealized as a dynamic system of 6-degree-of-freedom and the tyre cornering characteristic of the steering and stabilizing wheels were taken into account. The motion equations of the straddle type monorail vehicle were derived based on the Newton method and the motion differential equations of the track beam were derived by using modal synthesis method.

81355132993	Torsional fretting wear damage research under different slip regime	Tiny vibration could result in notable damage, reducing the use performance and life of closed assembled components which are in vibration circumstance. Surface and sub-surface stress, strain FEM analysis, and reasonable explain for damage form were taken for the different slip regime on torsional fretting wear. The results showed that the torque curve shape of the different slip regime agrees with the experimental results. The primary elastic deformation in partial slip indicates slight damage. Rapidly increasing plastic strain along with the increasing angular displacement amplitude and frictional coefficient results in severity wear in gross slip. The stress analysis showed that wear was not main surface damage, while lognitudinal crack near the surface in the stick-slip boundaries was main damage in the mixed slip. The analysis results about damage form of different slip regime in this paper are consistent with the test results.

81355150722	Flutter analysis of truncated conical shell with initial stress	To investigate the flutter properties of a complete truncated conical shell with initial stress, using the first-order piston aerodynamic theory, the aeroelastic equations of the truncated conical shell with initial stress were established. One dimensional differential quadrature method (DQM) was used to obtain the discrete form of the governing equations. The analysis was focused on the effects of the initial stress on the nature frequencies and the critical aerodynamic pressures. The results showed that the first order frequency and the 1-2 couple modal flutter critical aerodynamic pressure decrease with the increase of the initial compressive stress. The effects of the initial circumferential stress on the frequency and the critical aerodynamic pressure are stronger than those of the longitudinal stress.

84859088355	Finite element and experimental investigation of human femur cortical bone microdamage during radial fretting	Accumulation of microdamage can result in increased bone fragility and osteoporotic fracture in human bone.Microcracks in bone have been implicated in the development of stress fractures.The goal of this study was to investigate the human femur cortical bone microdamage during radial fretting and its stress and strain distribution. Modeling and analysis were taken for Haversian system using FEM soft. Analytical results indicated that stress concentration which occurred in the haversian canal and around circumferential lamellas and through the circumferential lamellas and the interstitial tissues could lead to microcrack initiation of multi-areas. In addition, microcrack could occur as a result of a rather large plastic area which crossed interstitial bone and connected adjacent osteon under high load condition. In the meantime, radial fretting behaviors of the fresh human axial femur compact bone were investigated under a flat-on-ball configuration in high accuracy hydraulic servo fretting experimental machine. The kinetics behaviors of the compact bone were revealed by the F-D curves. The surface damage was analyzed combined with the examinations by laser confocal scanning microscopy (LCSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) . The morphologies showed that the microcracks were the primary damage form.The results showed that three typical types of cracks -radial microcrack, annular microcrack and linking microcrack were observed. The test results and the FEM analysis results were of good consistency, and brought forth that most of microcracks run between the surrounding interstitial bone and the cement line. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

0037332811	Synchronizing chaotic systems using backstepping design	Backstepping design is a recursive procedure that combines the choice of a Lyapunov function with the design of a controller. In this paper it is proposed for synchronizing chaotic systems. There are several advantages in this method for synchronizing chaotic systems: (a) it presents a systematic procedure for selecting a proper controller in chaos synchronization; (b) it can be applied to a variety of chaotic systems whether they contain external excitation or not; (c) it needs only one controller to realize synchronization between chaotic systems; (d) there is no derivatives in controller, so it is easy to be complemented. Examples of Lorenz system, Chua's circuit and Duffing system are presented. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

84869791113	Unsteady characteristics of vortex breakdown over delta wing	In order to investigate the unsteady characteristics of the broken vortices over delta wing after the leading edge vortices were broken down, experiments of dynamic pressure measurement were carried out on the surface of the 75° sweep delta wing in a wind tunnel. Experimental results show that the root mean square (RMS) pressure fluctuation is positively correlated with the fluid state of leading edge vortices on the top surface of delta wing. At the angle of attack region with leading edge vortices breakdown, the maximal RMS pressure fluctuation is 33 Pa. With increasing angle of attack, the variation of buffeting strength has the same tendency as that of RMS pressure fluctuation. Analysis of the pressure signal shows that the pressure fluctuations over the delta wing are mainly caused by the spiral wave of the broken-down vortex flow, which leads to the buffeting of the delta wing.

84870758513	Flutter analysis of panel with boundary conditions relaxation	Based on the first piston theory of supersonic aerodynamics, the flutter differential equations of a three dimension panel are set up according to the Von Karman large deformation strain-displacement relation by using a Galerkin approach. The influence of a boundary condition relaxation, in-plane load and length-to-width ratios of panel are analyzed. The results show that with the relaxation of boundary conditions the critical dynamic pressures acting on the panel reduce and the static stability of system decreases, while the probability of buckle and chaos increase as the relaxation of boundary conditions. The results also indicate even though the dynamic pressure is less than the critical dynamic pressure, the panel is likely to experience limit cycle oscillations or chaotic motion as the relaxation of boundary conditions. In addition, the more compression in-plane loads and the lower length-to-width ratio are no beneficial to the flutter stability of the panel.

DQM is an efficient discretization technique for obtaining accurate numerical solutions to initial and/or boundary value problems using a considerably small number of grid points. In this way, a theoretical DQM model for the laminated composite beam has been developed. Some of the results obtained from DQM are compared with the results obtained in the literature. It has been seen that all of the results considered are very close to each other.

Moreover, the feedback of accelerations was taken into account. At last, a 10-story shear model undergoing the 1940 El Centro earthquake record was simulated. The results of the simulation indicated that the improved IOC algorithm is effective in controlling the acceleration, velocity and displacement responses of the structure. In addition, the improved IOC algorithm appears to be more effective than the traditional one in controlling the responses of acceleration, velocity and displacement on the top floors and also the displacement responses between adjacent floors on the lower floors.

84878071982	Stochastic analysis of a nonlinear forced panel in subsonic flow with random pressure fluctuations	The stochastic behavior of a two-dimensional nonlinear panel subjected to subsonic flow with random pressure fluctuations and an external forcing is studied in this paper. The total aerodynamic pressure is considered as the sum of two parts, one given by the random pressure fluctuations on the panel in the absence of any panel motion, and the other due to the panel motion itself. The random pressure fluctuations are idealized as a zero mean Brownian motion. Galerkin method is used to transform the governing partial differential equation to a series of ordinary differential equations. The closed moment equations are obtained by the Itô differential rule and Gauss truncation. The stability and complex responses of the moment equations are presented in theoretical and numerical analysis. Results show that a bifurcation of fixed points occurs and the bifurcation point is determined as functions of noise spectral density, dynamic pressure, and panel structure parameters; the chaotic response regions and periodic response regions appear alternately in parameter spaces, the periodic responses trajectories change rhythmically, and the route from periodic responses to chaos is via doubling-period bifurcation. The treatment suggested in this paper can also be extended for the other fluid-structure dynamic systems. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.

84878073973	Analysis on the fluid and structure interaction in the control rod drop process	Background: The drop time of control rod assembly is one of the most important parameters to ensure the safe operation of nuclear power plants. Due to the fluid-structure interaction (FSI), the elastic structures, such as control rods and guide tubes, will vibrate in the dropping of control rod assembly. The impact and friction between the control rod and guide tubes caused by large transverse vibration will influence the drop time calculation. Purpose: To study in detail the flow-induced vibration and the friction, this paper focus on the fluid-structure interaction in the control rod drop process. Methods: Firstly, the vibration equations of control rod and guide tubes considering the fluid-structure interaction are established. Then the various fluid forces are analyzed in accordance with their qualities, and the influences of different guide tubes in a guide tubes array are also considered. Results: The friction between control rod and guide tube is not zero, and the friction under seismic condition is larger. Conclusions: The analysis on the fluid and structure interaction presented in this paper is reasonable and can improve current analytical models of control rod drop time calculation.

84888992699	On the stability and chaos of a plate with motion constraints subjected to subsonic flow	The non-linear dynamical behavior of a cantilevered plate with motion constraints in subsonic flow is investigated in this paper. The governing partial differential equation is transformed to a series of ordinary differential equations by using the Galerkin method. The fixed points and their stabilities of the system are presented in a parameter space based on qualitative analysis and numerical studies. The complex non-linear behavior in the region of dynamical instability is investigated by using numerical simulations. The region of dynamical instability is divided into four sub-regions according to different types of plate motion. Results show that symmetric and asymmetric limit cycle motions would occur after dynamical instability; the route from periodic motions to chaos is via doubling-period bifurcation; symmetric and asymmetric period-3 and period-6 motions appear along with chaotic motions; chaotic divergence and divergent motions occur with the increases of dynamic pressure. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84899120635	Finite element implementation of a varied friction model applied to torsional fretting wear	Coefficient of friction is a significant factor for investigating stress and strain on the contact surface for a problem on torsional fretting wear. First, in this paper, a variable coefficient of friction model related to space and time is introduced. The evolution of friction coefficient is governed by the local contact history and the slip distance. Then, this model is implemented in the finite element code ABAQUS by the user subroutine FRIC. A sphere-plane finite element model is constructed to simulate stress and strain on the contact surface under the torsional fretting loading. Comparisons between the experimental friction torque curves and the numerical data rooting from this model show a good agreement. In view of the relation between the plastic strain and friction shear stress, it is seen that damage mechanisms in the different slip regimes are different. Finally, crack initiation location in the mixed slip regime is predicted based on the Smith-Watson-Topper multiaxial fatigue criterion. The predicted results are in agreement with the corresponding experiments. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84911954904	Nonlinear flutter behavior of a plate with motion constraints in subsonic flow	This paper is aimed at presenting the nonlinear flutter peculiarities of a cantilevered plate with motion-limiting constraints in subsonic flow. A non-smooth free-play structural nonlinearity is considered to model the motion constraints. The governing nonlinear partial differential equation is discretized in space and time domains by using the Galerkin method. The equilibrium points and their stabilities are presented based on qualitative analysis and numerical studies. The system loses its stability by flutter and undergoes the limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) due to the nonlinearity. A heuristic analysis scheme based on the equivalent linearization method is applied to theoretical analysis of the LCOs. The Hopf and two-multiple semi-stable limit cycle bifurcation bifurcations are supercritical or subcritical, which is dependent on the location of the motion constraints. For some special cases the bifurcations are, interestingly, both supercritical and subcritical. The influence of varying parameters on the dynamics is discussed in detail. The results predicted by the analysis scheme are in good agreement with the numerical ones.

A nonlinear model for a simply supported plate-type beam in inviscid fluids, a solid-liquid coupling system, was established on the basis of the hypothesis that all the plates have the same deflections at any instant. An algebraic criterion of Hopf bifurcation was used to analyze the bifurcation of the structure. The result shows that there is no Hopf bifurcation for the structure in inviscid fluids. Finally, the static bifurcation of equilibrium positions and local stability of the structure were discussed.

Bounds on nonlinear perturbations that maintain the stability of an asymptotically stable, linear multi-degree-of-freedom system with nonclassical damping are derived. The explicit nature of the construction permits us to directly express the algebraic criteria in terms of plant parameters. The results are then applied to the symmetric output feedback control of multi-degree-of-freedom systems with nonlinear uncertainties. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the new stability criteria and to compare them with the previous results in the literature.
