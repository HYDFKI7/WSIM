33645786588	Investigation of nanocrystalline Cu by X-ray diffraction and positron annihilation	The nanocrystalline Cu was prepared by flow-levitation-cold-pressing method under different pressures and then annealed at different temperatures with different annealing time. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) were used to determine the structure and microdefects in the nanocrystallie Cu. The XRD analysis results show that the grain size of the specimen after being pressed is 20 nm and does not grow prominently after annealing below 300°C for 3 hours. The PAS analysis results show that most of the defects in the specimen after press are vacancies and vacancy-clusters, the amount of micro-voids is small. After being annealed at high temperature or for a long time, the vacancies aggregate together to form vacancy-cluster by diffusion and the micro-voids break up to form vacancy-cluster either, so that the amount of vacancy-clusters increases while the amount of vacancies and micro-voids decreases.

Experimental results show that the crystalline grain of nano-crystalline Cu ribbons is 65.17-121.8 nm. The quicker the speed of copper wheel is, the less the injected gas pressure is, the bigger the protective air pressure is, the colder the protect air is, and the smaller the crystalline grain is. There are distortion and fluctuation of crystalline lattice. All samples possess high preferred orientation crystallographic plane and (200) plane is the most prominent, (311) plane is the second, and other crystallographic planes are not highly preferred.

33847297530	Preparation and optical absorption spectra of silver nanoclusters	Silver nanoclusters were prepared by flow-levitation technique. The nucleation and growth mechanism of the nanoclusters were studied theoretically, and the experiment conditions and technological parameters were studied experimentally. The morphology, granularity, structure, chemical components and electronic structure properties of the as-grown silver nanoclusters were characterized. The results indicate that the average size and dimension distribution of the nanoparticles mainly depend on the cooling efficiency, flow rate and inert gas pressure of the inert gas, and the temperature and size of the metal drop. Only He was used as the carrying gas for producing particles with an average size less than 10 nm. The optical absorption spectra of Ag nanoclusters show that the value of the surface plasmon absorption peak strongly depends on the size of particles. Because of the quantum size effect, with the decrease of the particle size, the plasmon peak shifts toward the short wavelength while the plasmon band width increases.

The substrates were characterized by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results showed that the multi-crystalline gold nanoparticles which finally grew up to 140 nm after 20-hour irradiation took on irregular shape, and some of them stacked to form bilayer structure. A new broad band appeared in the absorption spectra of the substrates due to the interparticle dipole-dipole coupling of surface plasmon resonance response of the gold particles, which redshifted within 600~800 nm as the particles grew up, indicating the intensification of the coupling. The substrates had an emission band centered at 405 nm in their fluorescence spectra under excitation at 223 nm, which was ascribed to radioactive recombination of the excited surface electrons with cavities in the gold particles.

68949220223	Static dipole polarizabilities of Sc	The static dipole polarizabilities of scandium clusters with up to 15 atoms are determined by using the numerically finite field method in the framework of density functional theory. The electronic effects on the polarizabilities are investigated for the scandium clusters. We examine a large highest occupied molecular orbital - the lowest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap of a scandium cluster usually corresponds to a large dipole moment. The static polarizability per atom decreases slowly and exhibits local minimum with increasing cluster size. The polarizability anisotropy and the ratio of mean static polarizability to the HOMO-LUMO gap can also reflect the cluster stability. The polarizability of the scandium cluster is partially related to the HOMO-LUMO gap and is also dependent on geometrical characteristics. A strong correlation between the polarizability and ionization energy is observed. © 2009 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.

The effect of dealloying parameters, which include the electrolyte component, temperature and time of dealloying, on the residual Mn content and micro-morphology of nanoporous Cu was investigated. The results show that the nanoporous copper with a uniform three-dimensional pore structure can be created by dealloying in 0.1 mol/L HCl solution. The pore shape grows from honeycombs to three-dimensional networks with prolonging the corrosion time from 2 d to 5 d. Then with the continually increased corrosion time, the pore wall becomes coarse gradually. By increasing the temperature of the electrolyte to 60°C, the residual Mn content is reduced obviously. The resultant nanoporous copper possesses uniform porous structures in three-dimensional network, the porosity of 57.7%, and the average pore size of 140 nm.

The effect of initial alloy composition on micromorphology of nanoporous Cu and residual Mn atom fraction is investigated. The results indicate that, for alloys with Cu of more than 43% atom fraction, the dissolution of Mn is limited, leaving islands of retained Mn-Cu alloys. Bicontinuous ligament structures can be obtained as the initial Cu atom fraction decreases from 32% down to 23%. The ligaments of size from 20 to 100 nm and the nanopore of size from 30 to 80 nm can be tailored by controlling the initial alloy composition. However, the copper ligaments become large nanoparticles as the initial Cu atom fraction is below 20% and many cracks are observed after dealloying. A small amount of residual Mn exists in nanoporous copper and higher initial Mn atom fraction results in lower residual Mn atom fraction.

The calculations based on the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) method are performed and proved to converge accurately by satisfying the usual criteria related to the applicability of the DDA. The results show that the nanoshells in the core/shell system greatly influence the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Indeed, the shell frequency is tuned to match the optical properties of the absorbing core leading to hybridization/mixing and possibly overall enhancement of absorption cross-section.

The effects of mixing time, rotary speed and Sn content on average diameter of Sn particles and volume resistivity were studied. It is found that low-melting-point metals assemble and separate out partly in the case of metal volume fraction above 0.65% or mixing time above 5 min. When metal volume fraction is 0.65% and mixing time is 5 min, the assembling becomes unobvious. The average diameter of Sn particles in composite decreases early and then increases with the increase of mixing time, decreases early and then becomes invariant with the rotary speed increasing, and increases early and then decreases with the Sn content increasing. These factors also affect the volume resistivity of Sn/HDPE composite, but the effects of mixing time and rotary speed on volume resistivity are attribute to the effect of Sn particles size in composites.

84875937692	Green, one-step and template-free synthesis of silver spongelike networks via a solvothermal method	Silver spongelike networks were synthesized from an alkaline pH solution of silver nitrate and glucose under solvothermal conditions. The products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, UV-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction. These Ag nanoparticles (NPs) appear to undergo sequentially linear aggregation and welding initially, and then, they randomly cross link into self-supporting, three-dimensional (3D) networks with time. The carboxylate groups, generated by glucose oxidation, interacted with the Ag nanostructures, resulting in formation of silver spongelike networks having very uniform wire diameters distributions (about 20 nm in diameter). A new plasmon band was observed in the longer-wavelengths region (565-912 nm) of the conventional transverse plasmon resonance band at 430 nm. In principle, this one-step, template-free approach can also be extended to large-scale 3D organizations of other transition/noble metal NPs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84876017683	Effect of dealloying process on purity of nanoporous copper	Nanoporous Cu is synthesized by dealloying Mn-Cu precursors with the selective corrosion. The effects of time of heat treatment, the corrosion time and the temperature of dealloying on the porous morphology and the residual Mn content are investigated. It is revealed that the heat treatment can drive the composition to distribute homogeneously in the bulk alloy with increasing the time and consequently results in more fully dealloying for forming nanoporous Cu. There is no distinct decrease of the residual Mn content in the nanoporous Cu made from 95 h-heat-treated precursors with increasing the corrosion time. The residual Mn content in nanoporous Cu decreases from 3.54% at 25°C corrosion temperature to 1.14% at 60°C corrosion temperature. But the pore and the ligament sizes of the samples obviously coarsen after 60°C corrosion of the samples, and the samples are frangible. The resultant nanoporous copper possesses uniform porous structure in the three-dimensional network, with the residual Mn content of 1.23% and the average pore size of 40 nm.

84878955014	Evolution rule of microstructure, crystal grain size and surface roughness for Be films grown on K9 and Si(100) substrates	Be films grown on K9 and Si(100) substrates were fabricated by an evaporation deposition method. At the same deposition velocity, the growth morphology of Be films grown on the K9 substrate is different from that grown on the Si(100) substrate. Whereas, both of them have the similar evolution rule with the increase of deposition velocity, which changes from an equiaxed grain to a fiber grain, and then to a coarsening equiaxed grain. XRD and XPS analyses indicate that the Be films grown on different substrates at different deposition velocities consist mainly of HCP structure α-Be phase, and all of the Be film surface is oxidized. For the amorphous K9 substrate, the preferential growth orientation of Be film is always exposed to (101) crystal face. While, the grain orientation of the Si substrate is diversiform, a special crystal face can be shown at a certain deposition velocity. For the Be films grown on K9 substrate and Si(100) substrate, their variation trend of roughness R

84883377917	Tunable nanoscale confinement of energy and resonant edge effect in triangular gold nanoprisms	Here we provide a simulation based on discrete dipole approximation method of the properties of surface plasmons on triangular gold nanoprisms and investigate their electric-field distribution to identify different multiple surface plasmon resonances. Near-field maps of triangle gold nanoprisms are established. Symmetric field distribution has been obtained perpendicular to the orientation of direction of incident light. We examine how their propagation can be manipulated and discuss some of the parameters that influence optical response of noble metals. Reduction of prism thickness leads to hybridization/mixing between two horizontal triangular surfaces and possibly overall enhancement of absorption cross-section of nanoparticle and shows excellent ability to adjust the resonance peaks. Field distribution mainly distributes in the triangular surface or along the edges. At platelet corners, electric field is weak, and the trend that plasmons are partially transmitted to neighboring edges is displayed. The calculation of the field enhancement also shows that the location of the field enhancement is specified by the different resonance patterns. A "bridge" zone can be found in triangular surfaces at resonance wavelength, which refers to coupling effect between different poles. This is an essential step toward a thorough understanding of plasmon resonance in nanoprisms. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84890514115	Plasmonic coupling effect in silver spongelike networks nanoantenna for large increases of surface enhanced raman scattering	The electric field enhancement of the silver spongelike networks has been described to be a systematic investigation by using three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) simulation. Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements have indicated that the junction regions, the hollow nanostructured, and the sharp nanotips of the broken ligaments in the silver spongelike networks act as electromagnetic "hot-spots". The 3D-FDTD calculations have indicated that the silver spongelike networks may exhibit a high quality SERS characteristic because of the Ag chain length, chain diameters, chains gap, chains angle, and sharp nanotips.

84894587695	Silver nanoplates: Controlled preparation, self-assembly, and applications in surface-enhanced Raman scattering	Silver nanoplates were prepared in a dual reduction system with NaBH4 and sodium citrate both as reducing agents. And then the as-prepared nanoplates could be growing up through multistage growth methodology. The average edge length of Ag nanoplates can be tailored from 40 nm to 260 nm without changing their shape, crystallinity, and the average thickness. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these silver nanoplates as substrates prepared by the silanization self-assembly method toward surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection was evaluated by using 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) and rhodamine 6G (R6G) as probe molecules. It was found that the enhancement ability of the silver nanoplates film is remarkable lower than that of the spherical silver nanoparticle film. The reason is attributed to the electromagnetic mechanism and chemical mechanism. This work will be of great significance in understanding the SERS enhancement mechanism and in the fabrication of nanoparticle films for biosensing. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84899714856	Study on low temperature specific heat capacity of aluminum nanocrystalline	Aluminum nanoparticles with an average diameter of about 52 nm were compressed to form aluminum nanocrystalline in vacuum by the hot press sintering technology. The structure of aluminum nanoparticles and nanocrystals were characterized by TEM, EDS, XRD and SEM. The physics-property-measurement system (PPMS) was used to measure the specific heat of aluminum nanocrystalline as a function of temperature at the low temperature. The experimental results indicate that the specific heat capacity of aluminum nanocrystalline was strikingly enhanced in compare of the bulk at the low temperatures. Due to the influence of surface, grain boundary, etc., the low-temperature specific heat capacity of aluminum nanocrystalline changes with temperature following a relationship of T

84899853300	Influences of in situ annealing on microstructure, residual stress and electrical resistivity for sputter-deposited Be coating	The Be coating grown on K9 substrate are fabricated at different annealing temperatures by dc magnetron sputtering, and they are composed of α-Be phase with hcp structure from XRD analysis. As the in situ annealing temperatures increase from 60 °C to 410°C, the coating surfaces show the transition from fibrous grains dominated by surface diffusion to diamond-like grains, and then to recrystallized grains dominated by bulk diffusion. For the coating cross-section morphologies, they are always characterized by the coarsening columnar grains with distinct boundaries. Both surface roughness and grain size increase with annealing temperatures, and obey the modified Anelli model. Moreover, the constitutive relationship of Be coating was explored. The residual stress is related closely to the microstructures and annealing temperatures, not only displays the tensile stress but also compressive stress. The compression-tension transition temperature occurs near 250°C (0.34T

84902520694	Self-organized Ag nanorings antenna substrates for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy	We investigate the surface-enhanced Raman spec-troscopy of Ag nanorings antenna in both experiment and simulation. Self-organized Ag nanorings antenna were formed on quartz glass wafers by a simple chemistry reaction without any template. The three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulation calculations indicate that the electric field enhancement of Ag nanoring antenna is strongly dependent on the gap distance. A very strong surface plasmon coupling in the gap region of Ag nanoring antenna is observed, whose field intensity is enhanced four times compared to that for Ag nanodomes antenna with the same gap distance. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements have shown that the SERS intensity acquired from the Ag nanoring antenna is about 16 times stronger than that obtained from Ag nanodomes antenna. These results pave the way to design plasmonic nanostructures for practical applications that require coupled metallic nanoparticles with enhanced electric fields.

84901992548	Sputtering pressure influence on growth morphology, surface roughness, and electrical resistivity for strong anisotropy beryllium film	The strong anisotropy beryllium (Be) films are fabricated at different sputtering pressures by direct current magnetron sputtering. With the increase of pressure, the deposition rate of Be film first increases, and when the pressure exceeds 0.8 Pa, it gradually descends. The X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that Be film is of α-Be phase, its surface always reveals the (101) crystal plane possessing the low surface energy. As for the growth morphology of Be film, the surface is mainly characterized by the fibrous grains, while the cross section shows a transition from a columnar grain to a mixed grain consisting of a cone-shaped grain and a columnar grain as the sputtering pressure increases. The large grain fraction decays exponentially from 75.0% to 59.3% with the increase of sputtering pressure p, which can improve the grain size uniformity. The surface roughness increases due to the insufficient atom diffusion, which is comparable to its decrease due to the etching effect at p < 0.8 Pa, while it increases drastically at p > 0.8 Pa, and this increase is dominated by the atom diffusion. The electrical resistivity values of Be films range from 1.7 μΩ·m to 2.7 μΩ·m in the range 0.4 Pa-1.2 Pa, which is 50 times larger than the bulk resistivity. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84905215980	Fabrication of Ag nanocluster and adjustment of particle size by plasma vapor deposition	Ag nanoclusters are prepared by plasma gas condensation method, The parameter dependences of Ag nanoclusters are also studied. The particle diameter and size distribution are measured by in-situ quadrupole mass filter and compared with the analysis of transmission electron microscope (TEM). The results show that keeping other parameters fixed, the average size increases gradually with the increase of sputtering current, aggregation zone length and Ar flow rate, respectively. However, it decreases when the Ar gas flow rate is more than 60 mL/min. The addition of He in Ar gas causes the decline of the average size, which can be enhanced by increasing the He flow rate. The sputtering current and Ar flow rate are key parameters affecting the average size of Ag nanoclusters.The TEM results show that average size of Ag nanoclusters is 2, 4 and 6 nm, respectively by adjusting the parameters. It is also indicated that the size and distribution data of Ag nanoclusters by TEM analysis and in situ quadrupole mass spectrometer are consistent.

84906837488	Microstructure and microhardness of nanocrystalline Al prepared by hot pressing	Nanocrystalline Al (nc Al) bulks with average grain sizes of 90 - 123 nm were prepared by pressing Al nanopowders which were produced by the flow-levitation method. The effect of the hot-pressing temperature and pressure on microstructure and microhardness of the nc Al was analyzed by XRD, SEM and microhardness test. The results indicate that the microhardness of the nc Al is from 0.8 to 1.98 GPa, depending on the density, grain size, microstrain and structure of alumina. The microhardness firstly increases and then decreases with increasing the hot-pressing temperature, while it increases at a slower rate after a fast increase with increasing the hot-pressing pressure. In different hot-pressing temperatures and pressures, the different mechanism dominates the densification process of the nc Al. Different from the high-density nc Al bulks, the bulks with lower density obviously show an indentation size effect.

Here, the role of the Au core is typically central. We focus on the effect of the interlayer properties on SPR. If the interlayer is metallic, the contribution of the Au core to SPR is found to be suppressed, while the semiconductor interlayer can enhance this contribution. The porous Si interlayer exhibits the combined features inherent to a cavity and amorphous Si. These conclusions are illustrated by showing the distribution of electric field in and near nanoparticles.

84920736106	Nanocrystalline aluminum studied by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy	Aluminum nanoparticles with an average diameter of about 48 nm are compressed in a cemented-carbide mold under different pressures to produce nanocrystalline aluminum by the hot-pressing technology in a high vacuum condition. The X-ray diffraction and the positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) are used to characterize the microscopic structures of nanocrystalline aluminum. The PALS experimental results indicate that there are three types of defects in nanocrystalline aluminum, i.e., vacancy-like defects, vacancy clusters, and microvoids, which are corresponding to three lifetime components of positrons. The pressure for compaction has a great influence on the positron annihilating behavior. The vacancy clusters transform into the vacancy-like defects with increasing the pressure when it is below 0.39 GPa. The three types of defects tend to be rapidly eliminated in a pressure range from 0.39 GPa to 0.72 GPa. When pressure is above 0.72 GPa, the defects are further eliminated in nanocrystalline aluminum. The density and microhardness of nanocrystalline aluminum increase significantly with increasing the pressure for compaction.
