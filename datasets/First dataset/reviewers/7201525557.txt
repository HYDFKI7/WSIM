0032404976	A method for oil pipeline leak detection based on distributed fibre optic technology	Pipeline leak detection is a difficult problem to solve up to now. Some traditional leak detection methods have such problems as high rate of false alarm or missing detection, low location estimate capability. For the problems given above, a method for oil pipeline leak detection based on distributed optical fibre sensor with special coating is presented. The fibre's coating interacts with hydrocarbon molecules in oil, which alters the refractive index of the coating. Therefore the light-guiding properties of the fibre are modified. Thus pipeline leak location can be determined by OTDR. Oil pipeline leak detection system is designed based on the principle. The system has some features like real time, multi-point detection at the same time and high location accuracy. In the end, some factors that probably influence detection are analysed and primary improving actions are given.

34147222272	New signal processing method with negative frequency contribution for Coriolis mass flowmeter	Because the contribution of negative frequency is neglected in the algorithm, long convergence process exists when calculating phase difference between two signals of Coriolis mass flowmeter using sliding Goertzel algorithm. A new signal processing method for Coriolis mass flowmeter is proposed, which is based on the recursive DTFT algorithm and considers the contribution of negative frequency. First, an adaptive lattice notch filter is applied to filter the sensor output signals of Coriolis mass flowmeter and calculate the frequency. Then, the recursive DTFT algorithm with negative frequency contribution is used to calculate the real-time phase difference between the two enhanced signals. With the frequency and the phase difference obtained, the time interval of two signals is calculated and then the mass flow is derived. Simulation results show that the convergence process of phase difference and time interval calculation is largely shortened by the proposed method. So the accuracy of phase difference and time interval calculation is improved. Furthermore, the new method is less prone to numerical overflow problem while applied to practical systems.

84897874332	Feedback corrected adaptive notch filter for vibration signal frequency tracking	The precision of vibration frequency estimation with an adaptive notch filter (ANF) is not satisfactory all the time. It was found through analysis that the fundamental reason is the ANF error converges to a local optimum value. Here, a feedback corrected ANF was proposed of an ANF, with the idea of feedback control. According to the correlation between an input signal and an output one, a factor evaluating its frequency tracking accuracy was designed to monitor its working status. If the factor was less than a given threshold value, it was said that the ANF lost vibration frequency. Then, it was demanded to enlarge the bandwidth of the ANF so that the frequency could be re-tracked accurately. To insure the faster re-converging speed, a feedback strategy adjusting the ANF's parameters appropriately rather than re-initialization was applied. An ANF based on Steiglitz-McBride method (SMM-ANF) was taken as an example to illustrate the feedback correction strategy. Its flow process and the corresponding algorithm were also exhibited. The performances of a Lattice ANF, a SMM-ANF and a feedback corrected SMM-ANF were compared with simulations. An instance of the proposed method applied in Coriolis mass flow meter was given briefly. Results showed that the convergence rate of the feedback corrected SMM-ANF is lower than that of the original SMM-ANF, higher than that of the lattice ANF; its continual frequency tracking performance is obviously better than that of the others.

The exact solution of the force acting on latex particle by oil is not clear yet. By establishing a model of single particle's flexing and deformation in oil, the velocity potential of the liquid inside the particle was obtained.

In the course of latex particle's deformation, the force produced by the oil around was calculated at the instant of deformation with the theory of Stokes flow. The results of numerical calculation showed that at a small deformation of particle, the force coefficients agreed well with the calculation based on the assumption of linear distribution of particle's deformation. When the length of particle's long axis was greater than three times of short axis, the force coefficient tended to a minimal value, close to zero. So the force on deforming latex particle by oil at an arbitrary moment could be solved with the exact expression.

84905222589	Research on phase difference measurement algorithm for non-integer period sampling signal based on multi-layer correlation	Aiming at the poor precision problem in phase difference measurement with unknown frequency in engineering practice, a new method for non-integer period sampling signal phase difference measurement based on multi-layer correlation is proposed. Firstly, a lattice adaptive notch filter is applied to filter the signals and estimate the frequency. Then, the Hilbert transformation is conducted on the two filtered enhanced signals to generate two phase shifted signals that have 90° phase shift. And then, two reference signals that have 90° phase shift are generated using the estimated signal frequency. At last, the correlation functions of the original enhanced signals & two phase shifted signals and the two reference signals are directly computed, certain properties of correlation and sine function are adopted to obtain the computational formula of phase difference. The experiment results show that the measurement accuracy of the proposed method is not affected by whether the sampling is in integer periods or not; and the method can achieve dynamic phase difference measurement. Compared with traditional methods, this method has higher measurement accuracy and stronger anti-disturbance capability, and has good robustness and universality.

84908053956	Research on phase difference measurement for non-integer period sampling signal based on correlation theory	In order to improve the accuracy of phase difference measurement under non-integer period sampling circumstance with correlation method, a new phase difference measurement method for non-integer period sampling signal based on correlation theory is proposed. Firstly, lattice adaptive notch filter is applied to filter the signals and estimate the frequency of the signal. Then, two reference signals that have 90 degree phase shift are generated from the two filtered signals with same frequency. And then, the correlation functions of the original signals and reference signals are directly computed; certain properties of correlation and sine function are adopted to obtain the computational formula for phase difference. At the same time, aiming at the situation where the phase shifts of the two reference signals are unequal to 90 degrees, error analysis is carried out and relevant compensation method is presented. Theoretical analyses show that the measurement accuracy for this method is not affected by the condition whether the signal is integer period sampling or not; and the method can also measure dynamic phase difference.

84921496671	Two new sliding DTFT algorithms for phase difference measurement based on a new kind of windows	For the ultra-low frequency signals or adjacent Nyquist frequency signals, which exist in the vibration engineering domain, the traditional DTFT-based algorithm shows serious bias for phase difference measurement. It is indicated that the spectrum leakage and negative frequency contribution are the essential causes of the bias. In order to improve the phase difference measurement accuracy of the DTFT-based algorithm, two new sliding DTFT algorithms for phase difference measurement based on a new kind of windows are proposed, respectively. Firstly, the new kind of windows developed by convolving conventional rectangular windows is introduced, which obtains a stronger inhibition of spectrum leakage. Then, with negative frequency contribution considered, two new formulas for phase difference calculation under the new kind of windows are derived in detail. Finally, the idea of sliding recursive is proposed to decrease the computational load. The proposed algorithms are easy to be realized and have a higher accuracy than the traditional DTFT-based algorithm. Simulations and engineering applications verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
