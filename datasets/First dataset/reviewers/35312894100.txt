14744276522	In vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells induced by retinoid acid and co-culture of retinal cells	Objective: To analyze the differentiation features of embryonic stem cells (ESC) induced by retinoid acid (RA) and co-culture of retinal cells. Methods ESCs were propagated 1 generation after anabiosis to gain embryonic bodies (EB). 3.5-day EB was added to 24 holes panel containing RA and the bottles cultured retinal cells and RA, and RA was added to the bottles containing retinal cells without ES as control. The changes of ESC and retinal cells were observed under the convert discrepancy microscope. Immunocytochemistry was adopted to detect the nestin, GFAP, cytokeratin, MAP-2 and rhodopsin during the inducing period. Results Various shapes of induced-cells appeared in medium containing RA. When ESCs were induced by RA and cocultured with mixed retinal cells, the differentiated-cells from EB appeared to be relatively simple with round and transparent appearance. Some sticking-wall retinal cells showed a net-shaped structure. Most induced-cells from ESC showed a positive reaction for MAP-2, and little cells were nestin positive in both medium. GFAP, cytokeratin and rhodopsin positive cells could be seen under the ESC and retinal cells co-culture condition. Conclusion RA can induce ESC into neurons in second induction. More purified cells could be gained by stimulation of RA and co-culture ESC with retinal cells. Some of induced-cells express the features of retinal cells.

14844284566	Screening of differential expression genes between primary breast cancer and its lymph node metastasis using single primer amplification of cDNA for microarray	Objective: To screen genes related to breast cancer metastasis by comparing difference of expression profile between primary breast cancer and its lymph node metastasis. Methods: The cell total RNA was extracted from 10 breast cancer specimens, including the primary cancer and metastatic cancer tissues of axillary lymph nodes resected during operation. Single primer amplification ( SPA ) was used to prepare fluorescence-labeled targets and then Oligo microarray concluding 21 000 human functional genes was used to screen out 1. 5 fold or more differential expression genes in at least 5 pairs of samples. The screened-out genes were identified by real-time PCR. Results: Preparing targets by using SPA reduced the initial RNA to 0.25 μg, with 57 genes screened out, the expression of 19 of which were up-regulated and the expression of 38 of which were down-regulated in the metastatic tissues. Eight differentially expressed genes were related to cell migration and adhesion, 14 to signal transduction, and 14 to cell growth or metabolism. Real-time PCR showed that the fibronection (FN) mRNA expression in the lymph node metastasis was only 1/3.6 of that in the matched primary breast cancer in 30 cases ( t = - 3.188, P = 0.003 ). Conclusion: SPA is a sensitive method for preparing targets. Genes related to cell migration and adhesion, signal transduction, and ell growth or metabolism, which are associated with the biology process of metastasis have been screened out.

18344372232	Data organization method for digital mapping in a major project	Data organization method has an important significance on digital mapping in the construction of major projects. According to the needs of data for digital mapping in major projects, three kinds of data are discussed here based on the maps of engineering geological plane, engineering geological section and drill histogram to discuss the organization methods of digital mapping. Data of geological plane can be divided into two types that are spatial data and property ones. Spatial data are stored as graphic documents according to their sizes and scales, and their organization models are divided into three levels, which are spatial object, map layers and maps; Property data stored by relationship database, and their visiting are realized by the connection of opening database. Data of geological section can be divided into drill spatial data and drill strata data. Drill spatial data are stored as graphic documents; drill strata data belong to property data which can be only stored in relationship database tables; Through by setting up a byte for showing the dill number and its corresponding drill data, the relationship between drill strata data and drill spatial data is established. Data of drill histogram are all property ones; thus, they also only can be stored in the relationship database according to two ways: the one is basic drill information table and the other is drill strata information table. By applying above discussed data organization methods into the development of Underground Environmental Information System (UEIS) of Water Supply Reconstruction Project from Dongjiang to Shenzhen in Guangdong Province, China, the intellectual digital mapping function is realized. The results show that the mapping precision is coincided well with the maps from investigation reports, but no matter what the mapping efficiency or the mapping effect are advantage that of the maps drawing by the general way.

23744515646	Classification of rocks surrounding tunnel based on improved BP network algorithm	The classification of rocks surrounding a tunnel has an important significance for guiding design and construction in under ground engineering. This paper introduces an artificial neural network method into the classification of these rocks. Based on traditional back propagation (BP) arithmetic, an enhanced neural network method is obtained by improving the training algorithm, transfer function and network structure. By combining the additive momentum method with the self-adjusting learning speed method, the algorithm has been improved: when the error is bigger than the upper critical limits the learning speed automatically decreases; when the error is smaller than the lower critical limits the learning speed automatically increases. Thus, the training speed can be fast yet at the same time the stability of the network can be ensured. By introducing the parameter of adjusting learning speed, the transfer process becomes more sensitive and the convergent speed becomes faster, thus, increasing the calculating precision of the training function. By giving a data range for a certain implicit layer joint model, the structure of the network is optimized; correspondingly the functional precision is improved. The improved BP network model is tested in example classifications of some typical rocks surrounding tunnels in the Dong Shen Water Supply Reconstruction Project. The results fit well with the classification according the code of hydraulic tunnel design in China, which indicates that this improved method has a high practical application.

Methods: Tow representative big rest homes (municipal one and provincial one) with medical service in Harbin city were selected to investigate the residents (n=241) aged ≥60 years between September 2004 and January 2005. The elderly depressive symptoms were assessed with geriatric depression scale (GDS); the stress factors of life events, active coping style and negative coping styles in the psychosocial stress survey for groups (PSSG) were taken as the investigative factors; The items of G4 satisfaction with health, F14 influence of pain, F11.4 medical dependence, F18.1 self-perception of finance,F9.1 activity ability, F10.3 satisfaction with activities of daily living (ADL), F11.3 satisfaction with habitation condition in WHO quality of life-brief (WHOQOL-BREF) were taken as the investigative factors; The subjective social support was evaluated by the aspect about satisfaction with social support of WHO quality of life-100 (WHOQOL-100); The drinking problems in this group were detected with alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT). The individual conditions were investigated with self-designed questionnaire, including gender, age, religion belief, marriage status, with or without child, income, educational background, living time in rest home, will of institutional care to the elderly, smoking and drinking, disease. The uniform investigative methods and instruction were used, the residents were surveyed by taking one floor as a unit. The subjects filled the questionnaire by themselves if they could write, the questionnaires were sent out and recollected uniformly; the questionnaires for those who could not write were finished by the investigator according to the oral answers of the subjects, and the quostionnaires were rechecked after recollection, and timely complement and adjustment were given if there was omission. Evaluative standard: the score of GDS ranged 1-10 as no depression, 11-20 as mild depression, 21-30 as moderate to severe depression. Results: Totally 241 questionnaires were sent out, all were recollected, and 20 invalid ones were excluded, there were 221 effective ones, the effective rate was 91.7%. 1 The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 24.9% (55 case) among the elderly residents above 60 years in the rest homes, including 17.2% (38 case) had mild depression and 7.7% (17 case) had moderate to severe depression. 2 The univariate Logistic regression showed that the related factors for the occurrence of depression were healthy factors (with or without disease, severity of disease, feeling of suffering disease, influence of pain, satisfaction with health, medical dependence, activity ability and satisfaction with ADL), psychosocial factors (with or without child, income, life events, active coping style, negative coping style, self-perception of finance, subjective social support), and factors related to rest home (will of institutional care to the elderly, service assessment, satisfaction with habitation condition). Multivariate Logistic stepwise regression analysis showed that the factors affacted the occurrence of depressive symptoms were will of institutional care to the elderly, negative coping style, satisfaction with health and self-perception of finance. 3 The factors affected the aggravation of depressive symptoms screened out by the univariate Logistic regression were the satisfaction with ADL, negative coping style, service assessment and medical dependence, and those screened out by the multivariate Logistic stepwise regression analysis were service assessment and satisfaction with ADL. Conclusion: The prevalence of depressive symptoms among the elderly residents in rest home is similar to that in community-dwelling elderly people in China, but it is lower than that among the elderly people in the nursing home of some western countries. Healthy factors, psychosocial factors and factors related to rest homes have significant effect on the occurrence and aggravation of depressive symptoms. The steps of preventive and rehabilitative interventions in depressive symptoms should be administered according to the related factors.

33847352200	Relations of transforming growth factor-β1 expression to differentiation and prognosis of advanced gastric cancer	Objective: To clarify the correlation of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) expression with differentiation and prognosis of advanced gastric cancer (GC). Methods: Whole genome expression chip hybridization, was used to detect the expression of TGF-β1 and TGF-βR1 in 20 specimens of intestinal-type GC and para-cancer tissues. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression of TGF-β1 and TGF-βR1 in 30 specimens of intestinal-type GC tissue and para-cancer tissues. The mixture of gastric mucosa tissues from 20 non-tumor patients was used as common reference. Results: The expression level of TGF-β1 and TGF-βR-1 genes was higher in the GC tissues than in the para-cancer tissues. However, the expression of Smad gene family was not significantly different between the GC tissues and para-tumor normal tissues. TGF-β1 gene expression and TGF-βR1 gene expression were higher in the GC tissues. RT-PCR showed that both TGF-β1 and TGF-βR-1 genes were highly expressed in the mRNA level in 21 of the 30 GC patients IHC showed that TGF-β1 protein was expressed mainly in the cytoplasm. 32 of the 90 specimens of GC tissue were highly positive in TGF-β1 protein (64%), in comparison with the positive rate of 5% (1/20) in the para-cancer normal tissues. The TGF-β1 protein expression rate of the highly and moderately differentiated GC tissues was 59% (59%, 23/39), significantly higher than that of the lowly differentiated GC tissues (18%, 9/51, P < 0.01). IHC showed that the TGF-βR-I rate was 57% (42/74) in the well differentiated specimens, particularly 68% (26/38) in the highly differentiated specimens, and was 44% in the poorly differentiated GC (6/20, P < 0.05). Log rank test showed that the prognosis of the patients positive in TGF-β1 was significantly better than those negative in TGF-β1 (P = 0.0058). However, the survival rate did not differ significantly according to TGF-βR- I expression (P = 0.8453). Conclusion: TGF-β1 expression is significantly correlated with the differentiation degree of GC. Moreover, positive expression of TGF-β1 is a favorable prognostic factor in advanced GC. Expression of TGF-β1 may be an important preoperative prognostic variable for advanced GC.

34547977606	Retrospective analysis on acute respiratory distress syndrome in ICU	Objective: To assess the incidence, etiology, physiological and clinical features, mortality, and predictors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: A retrospective analysis of 5 314 patients admitted to the ICU of our hospital from April 1994 to December 2003 was performed in this study. The ARDS patients were identified with the criteria of the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC). Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation III (APACHE III), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome score (MODS score), and lung injury score (LIS) were determined on the onset day of ARDS for all the patients. Other recorded variables included age, sex, biochemical indicators, blood gas analysis, length of stay in ICU, length of ventilation, presence or absence of tracheostomy, ventilation variables, elective operation or emergency operation. Results: Totally, 131 patients (2.5%) developed ARDS, among whom, 12 patients were excluded from this study because they died within 24 hours and other 4 patients were also excluded for their incomplete information. Therefore, there were only 115 cases (62 males and 53 females, aged 22-75 years, 58 years on average) left, accounting for 2.2 % of the total admitted patients. Their average ICU stay was (11.27 ± 7.24) days and APACHE III score was 17.23 ± 7.21. Pneumonia and sepsis were the main cause of ARDS. The non-survivors were obviously older and showed significant difference in the ICU length of stay and length of ventilation as compared with the survivors. On admission, the non-survivors had significantly higher MODS and lower BE (base excess). The hospital mortality was 55.7%. The main cause of death was multiple organ failure. Predictors of death at the onset of ARDS were advanced age, MODS ≥8, and LIS ≥2.76. Conclusions: ARDS is a frequent syndrome in this cohort. Sepsis and pneumonia are the most common risk factors. The main cause of death is multiple organ failure. The mortality is high but similar to most recent series including severe comorbidities. Based on this patient population, advanced age, MODS score, and LIS may be the important prognostic indicators for ARDS.

In this paper we propose a novel neural network structure as an intelligent control scheme to perform ATM admission control. The neural estimator can learn the probability distribution of the CLR, thus can control the ATM traffic very accurately and dynamically. The discrete structure of the neural estimator makes it easy to learn and operate. The trained neural network can also be used as a buffer estimator in the reference design of ATM system. The simulation result shows the advantage of this neural estimator.

Methods: Percutaneous biliary drainage and implantation of biliary stents for malignant biliary obstruction under fluoroscopic guidance was performed in 113 patients. Thirteen of them developed severe complications: drainage catheter slipping and locating between liver and abdominal in 4 cases, bowl obstruction due to lower implantation or slipping of stent into the duodenum in 4 cases, and plenty of bloody drainage in 5 cases. Results: For the 4 cases of drainage catheter slipping, under guidance of CT scan (2 cases) or DSA fluoroscopy (2 cases), 21G needle was used to puncture the drainage catheter left in biliary tract in order to fix the catheter so as to avoid its continuous slipping. Then curved catheter located between the abdominal wall and liver could be pulled straight and then advanced into the biliary tract again with the help of a guide wire. For the complication of bowl obstruction in 4 cases, stent was captured and pulled out through oral cavity and then a new stent was implanted back with the help of endoscopy in 3 cases. One patient refused to accept re-implantation of stent and had to undergo nasobiliary drainage. Complication of bloody drainage was successfully overcome by embolizing the bleeding blood vessel or implanting covered stent in the site of fistula caused by puncture in 5 cases. Conclusion: Active attitude and methods should be adopted to cope with severe complications after percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and percutaneous implantation of biliary stents for better prognosis.

Etanercept, antagon of TNF-α, shows notable effect in treating rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, we investigated the influence of etanercept on Ti particles-induced osteolysis and osteoclastogenesis in mice and evaluate the feasibility of etanercept for treatment of artificial joint aseptic loosening. Methods: The experiment was performed at the Key Laboratory of Genesiology and Genetics, and Pathological Laboratory of Hospital, Ningxia Medical College from February to August 2007. 1 Sixty BALB/C mice were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 10): blank control group, Ti (Zimmer, USA) treatment group, and 20, 50, 100, 200 μg/kg etanercept (Wyeth, USA, No. P321686) plus Ti treatment group. 2 Bone resorption models of Ti particles were established in all groups exception blank control group (in situ suture with no Ti particles). Different doses of etanercept (20, 50, 100 200 μ g/kg) were intraperitoneally injected into etanercept groups on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively. Ten days later, mice cranial bones were harvested for HE staining to observe bone resorption. Number of osteoclast was counted using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Results: HE staining showed that bone resorption in Ti treatment group was increased obviously and the structure of bone trabecula was disorderly and osteoporotic; the volume of osteoclast was enlarged and number was increased. The findings were reduced in etanercept groups, especially in 200 μ g/kg group. Compared with blank control group, Ti particles significantly increased osteolysis (P < 0.001) and osteoclastogenesis (P < 0.001); compared with Ti particles group, etanercept effectively inhibited Ti particles induqed osteolysis (P <0.05) and osteoclastogenesis (P < 0.05), especially in 200 μ g/kg group (P < 0.05). The result of TRAP was accorded with HE staining. Conclusion: Etanercept can inhibit Ti particles-induced osteolysis and osteoclastogenesis in vivo and is promising to be a therapeutic candidate for the prevention of artificial joint aseptic loosening.

48549093718	Innovative PDC bit design with fully embedded back-up cutters	PDC bits are generally inadaptable for drilling hard formation, especially for the gravel layer with high compressive strength and abrasion. Under such extreme conditions, the impact abrasion will severely decrease the durability of PDC cutters. A fully embedded back-up cutter technology for design of a new PDC bit can remarkably enhance its durability. The new technology can provide successive back-up cutting structure added on the ordinary cutters. The back-up cutters were placed beneath the primary cutters and fully embedded into the matrix body in conjunction with primary cutters to form a complex cutting structure capable of penetrating rocks successively. The embedded cutters start to work only after the primary cutters overhead worn out. Therefore, the life of PDC bit can be longer. The patented technology was applied successfully in drilling basal conglomerate formation of LD Oilfield in Bohai Bay of China, which greatly improved the drilling efficiency and reduced drilling cost.

Methods: RT-PCR was used to determine the expression of EGR1 in normal gastric mucosa tissues from 20 non-tumor patients, gastroenterological tumor tissues and matched para-cancer tissues normal morphologically. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to analyze the mRNA and protein expression of EG1 in 20 cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was preformed to measure the expression level of EGR1 protein on tissue microarray including 179 tumors and 159 normal tissues. Results: EGR1 was overexpressed in gastric cancer (GC) and its matched adjacent normal tissue (ANT), but not expressed or expressed at a low level in the normal gastric mucosa from the non-tumor patients, which was consistent with the GC gene expression profiling data. Overexpression of EGR1 was seen in the 20 cancer cell lines at both mRNA and protein levels. IHC showed strong positive staining of EGR1 protein in the cytoplasm of both tumor tissues and matched normal tissues and showed negative or weaker nuclear staining in the normal gastric mucosa tissues from non-tumor patients. Overexpression of EGR1 was detected in 87% (49/56) of the GC tissues and 79% (43/54) of their ANTs; 83% (43/52) of the hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and 79% (32/42) of their ANTs; 78% (41/52) of colorectal cancer tissues and 63% (22/35) of their ANTs; and 79% (15/19) of the squamous cell carcinoma tissues and 78% (14/18) of their ANTs.

70349495242	Application of multislice spiral CT angiography on transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma	Background and Objective: Multislice spiral CT angio-graphy (MSCTA) is very important in the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases. Currently, most studies on three-dimensional MSCTA of the liver vascular system focus on the liver tumors, preoperative assessment of liver transplantation and the systematic anatomy of the liver vascular system. This study was to investigate the clinical application of MSCTA on transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by comparing images of MSCTA and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Methods: MSCT dual-phase enhanced scanning was performed in 50 patients with advanced HCC. Both hepatic artery angiography and portal vein angiography were conducted using maximal intensity projection (MIP) and volume rendering technique (VRT). DSA of the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, renal artery and diaphragm artery, as well as TACE were performed in all patients. MSCTA and DSA images of the 50 patients were compared. Results: MSCTA and DSA showed equal detectability in revealing classification of the hepatic artery anatomy and tumor blood vessels, with a coincidence of 100% (p = 1.00). However, MSCTA was superior to DSA in displaying arterioportal shunt and portal vein tumor thrombus. Conclusions: As a noninvasive and easy to conduct technique, MSCTA can accurately provide information of the hepatic artery, portal vein and tumor supply vessels. Therefore MSCTA has a favorable value to guide TACE for HCC. © 2009 Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center.

70349601665	Cografted wharton's jelly cells-derived neurospheres and BDNF promote functional recovery after rat spinal cord transection	An animal model of transected spinal cord injury (SCI) was used to test the hypothesis that cografted human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells-derived neurospheres (HUMSC-NSs) and BDNF can promote morphologic and functional recoveries of injured spinal cord. In vitro, HUMSC-NSs terminally differentiated into higher percentages of cells expressing neuronal markers: β-tubulin III and MAP2ab by the supplement with BDNF. Following grafted into injured spinal cord, very few grafted cells survived in the HUMSC-NSs + BDNF-treated (<3%) and HUMSC-NSs-treated (<1%) groups. The survived cells were differentiated into various cells, which were confirmed by double staining of BrdU and neural or glia markers. In comparison, more grafted cells in the HUMSC-NSs + BDNF group transformed into mature neural-like cells, while more grafted cells in the HUMSC-NSs group transformed into oligodendrocyte-like cells. HUMSC-NSs + BDNF-treated group had more greatly improved BBB scores, compared with HUMSC-NSs-treated and medium-treated groups. Additionally, axonal regeneration showed significant improvement in rats receiving HUMSC-NSs + BDNF, compared with HUMSC-NSs-treated and medium-treated groups, as demonstrated by the NF-200-positive staining and Fluorogold (FG) retrograde tracing study. Lastly, a significant reduction in the percentage cavitation was seen in the two cell-treated groups compared with medium control group. These results means BDNF could promote the neural differentiation of HUMSC-NSs in vitro and in vivo. However, cellular replacement is unlikely to explain the improvement in functional outcome. The functional recovery might more rely on the axonal regeneration and neuroprotective action that active by the grafted cells. Cografted HUMSCs and BDNF is a potential therapy for SCI. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

70350475408	The effect of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy on non-small cell lung cancer	Objective: To investigate the effect of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) on non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 52 cases of I-IV stage NSCLC treated with 3DCRT and 50 NSCLC cases treated with conventional radiotherapy. In the 3DCRT group, only tumor and lymph nodes with metastasis were included in the clinical target, with 4-6 co-plane or non-co-plane shoot areas, at 2-3 Gy/fraction, once per day, 5 times per week, with a total dose of 66-72 Gy. In the conventional RT group, the shoot area contained obvious tumor and homonymy hilum of the lung, the mediastinum superior or hol-interpleural space, and circa para-prick. When the total dose reached 36-40 Gy, we altered the oblique portally administered radiation in order to avoid affecting the spinal cord. The regimen was DT 1.8-2.0 Gy/fraction, once per day, 5 times per week, with a total dose of 60-70 Gy. Results: The response rate (CR+PR) was 90.4% in the 3DCRT group and 72% in the conventional RT group, with a statistically significant difference(P<0. 01). The rate of improvement of clinical status was 96.5% in the 3DCRT group and 86.4% in the conventional RT group (P<0.01). In the 3DCRT group, the 0.5-, 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 92.3%, 75.0% and 42.3%, respectively. In the conventional RT group, the 0.5-, 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 76%, 60% and 30%, respectively. A statistically significant difference was found in the 0.5-year overall survival rate between the two groups. No significant difference was found in the 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates between the two groups. The adverse reaction rates in the 3DCRT and the conventional RT group were 12.5% and 23.7%, respectively, with a statistically significant difference between the two (P<0.05). No cases with stage III or higher in the 3DCRT group experienced severe adverse effects. Conclusion: 3DCRT is feasible for the treatment of NSCLC. 3DCRT has good therapeutic effects with slight adverse effects, improves clinical symptoms, and is well-tolerated.

72949098040	Blood pressure and heart rate in the implantation of bone cement during total hip replacement for 157 patients	OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of implantation of bone cement on blood pressure and heart rate of the elderly during joint replacement. METHODS: A total of 93 cases of femoral neck fracture, including 54 left hips and 39 right hips, underwent total hip replacement (THR) in Department of Orthopedics, Anhui Provincial Hospital of Anhui Medical University between July 2000 and March 2008. The patients aged from 60 to 70 years. A total of 64 cases of osteoarthritis underwent total knee replacement, including 27 cases of left knees and 37 cases of right knees. The blood pressure and heart rate were detected before and after bone cement application. RESULTS: The systolic blood pressure of patients undergoing THR using bone cement was significantly reduced compared with patients undergoing total knee replacement. Of 93 patients, the signs of 90 patients with different anesthesia methods before and after bone cement application were analyzed. The 35 patients by epidural anesthesia showed significantly different systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared with 55 patients by general anesthesia (P < 0.05), while no difference was found in heart rate (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The blood pressure should be rigorously monitored in implantation of bone cement during joint replacement, in particular THR.

77949916194	Norcantharidin-associated galactosylated chitosan nanoparticles for hepatocyte-targeted delivery	In this study a new chitosan (CS) derivative, galactosylated chitosan (GC), was synthesized and used to prepare norcantharidin-associated GC nanoparticles (NCTD-GC NPs) by taking advantage of the ionic cross-linkage between the molecules of the anti-hepatocarcinoma medicine NCTD and of the GC as carrier. NCTD-GC NPs were obtained with average particle size of 118.68 ± 3.37 nm, entrapment efficiency of 57.92 ± 0.40%, and drug-loading amount of 10.38 ± 0.06%. Several important factors influencing the entrapment efficiency, drug-loading amount, and particle size of NCTD-GC NPs were studied. The characteristics of sustained and pH-sensitive release of NCTD from NCTD-GC NPs in vitro were studied. In addition, in vitro cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of nanoparticles to hepatoma cell lines SMMC-7721 and HepG2 were also investigated. In vitro, and compared to CS-based NCTD-CS NPs, NCTD-GC NPs demonstrated satisfactory compatibility with hepatoma cells and strong cytotoxicity against hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In vivo antitumor activity of NCTD-GC NPs was evaluated in mice bearing H22 liver tumors. NCTD-GC NPs displayed tumor inhibition effect in mice, better than either the free NCTD or the NCTD-CS NPs. As a hepatocyte-targeting carrier, GC NPs are potentially promising for clinical applications. From the Clinical Editor: In this paper, a galactosylated chitosan (GC), was synthesized and norcantharidin (NCTD)-associated galactosylated chitosan nanoparticles (NCTDGC NPs) were generated by coupling NCTD - an anti-hepatocarcinoma drug - and GC as carrier. Compared to chitosan nanoparticles, NCTD-GC-NPs demonstrated satisfactory compatibility with hepatoma cells and strong cytotoxicity against the cells. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

77953756754	Restoration of femoral offset in revision total hip arthroplasty	BACKGROUND: Many studies have demonstrated that restoration of femoral offset in revision total hip arthroplasty would contribute to the recovery of joint function. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the importance of restoration of femoral offset in revision total hip arthroplasty on the recovery of joint function. METHODS: An observational study was performed at the Department of Orthopedics, Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University between February 2004 and May 2007. A total of 15 patients with the revision total hip arthroplasty, including 12 males and 3 females, aging 62-75 years, averaging 67 years old, were recruited into this study. Harris evaluation system was used to evaluate joint function. The femoral neck anteversion and the femoral offset were measured by the method of Sakai. The vertical distance from the teardrop line to the most prominent point of the lesser trochanter was measured from each radiograph. References were combined to investigate the effect of restoration of femoral offset in revision total hip arthroplasty on joint function. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: All the 15 patients were recruited into this study. The duration of follow-up ranged from 24 months to 5 years. We measured the femoral offset on pre-and post-operative radiographs, and the results indicated that the femoral offset of 4 patients were above 4 mm. The femoral offset of 11 patients was restored. The femoral offset were 22-48 (32.21±0.64) mm pre-and 22-57 (36.13±0.82) mm post-operative radiographs, respectively. The mean difference in femoral offset post-operatively was significant (t=0.424, P=0.01). Harris scores were good in 4 cases, passable in 2 cases, and poor in 9 cases pre-operatively, and the scores were excellent in 8 cases, good in 4 cases, passable in 2 cases, and poor in 1 case post-operatively. The score of Harris evaluation system in the patient of restoration group and failed restoration group were 88.72±5.3 (80%) and 72.32±6.5 (27%) post-operative at 1 month respectively.

77955281818	Antioxidation and antiglycation of polysaccharides from Misgurnus anguillicaudatus	Misgurnus anguillicaudatus is a fish widely inhabiting rivers, lakes, ponds, swamps and rice fields in China, Japan, Korea and other Asian countries. It is edible and can be used to treat xiao ke (namely diabetic) in traditional Chinese medicine. Polysaccharides from M. anguillicaudatus (MAPs) were extracted and separated into four parts which were named MAP I, MAP II MAP III and MAP IV, respectively. The percentage of polysaccharide in dry weight is about 3.06%. Hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical anion scavenging activities together with glycation inhibition of these polysaccharides were investigated. The results showed that all the MAPs had an inhibitory effect on oxidation and glycation and exhibited a dose-dependent response. Especially MAP IV displayed a stronger antioxidation effect than glucosamine and better antiglycation activities than aminoguanidine. As oxidation and glycation are relevant to diabetic complications, the result of this work suggests that MAPs may be effective in preventing and treating diabetic complications. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Sixty-eight patients with unresectable HCC were randomized into 2 age, tumor size, TNM stages, and liver function grade-matched groups: TACE group (n = 30) undergoing TACE and TACE + HIFU group (n = 38) undergoing 2-3 weeks after TACE. A total of 88 tumors (9.3 ± 3.2) (5.0-14.5) cm in diameter were detected, and the largest tumor in a specific patients with multiple lesions was selected for observation. Follow-up was conducted for (13 ± 7) (3-24) months to observe the necrosis of tumor, size of tumor, local recurrence, and survival of patient. Results: The clinical symptom remission rate was 90.6% (29/32) in the TACE + HIFU group and 70.8% (28/38) in the TACE group. The tumor necrosis and nunification rates of the TACE + HIFU and TACE groups were 73.7% and 68.4% respectively, both significantly higher than those of TACE group (26.7% and 33.3% respectively, both P < 0.01). The tumor local recurrence rate of the TACE + HIFU group was 21.1%, not significantly different from that of the TACE group (33.3%, P > 0.05). The median survival duration of the TACE + HIFU group was 18 months, significantly longer than that of the TACE group (10 months, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Compared with the TACE therapy alone, the combination therapy improves the tumor necrosis rate and prolongs the patients' survival duration.

77955077546	Imaging and histological features of intervertebral disc under injured vertebral body in Denis type B thoracolumbar burst fracture	BACKGROUND: Evaluation of vertebral disc under the vertebral body facilitates selection of treatments. Currently, studies of Denis type B fracture intervertebral disc appearance and function in vertebral burst fractures are few. OBJECTIVE: To observe the imaging and histological features of vertebral disc under the vertebral body of Denis type B thoracolumbar burst fracture, to further evaluate the effect of preserving the vertebral disc under the injured vertebral body. METHODS: A total of 18 cases with Denis type B thoracolumbar burst fracture underwent X-ray, CT, and MRI examination. The anterior and posterior margin of intervertebral height under the injured vertebral body were accessed and compared with the normal height of intervertebrae by X-ray. Oner classification was performed based on the outcome of MRI examination. The signal intensity of nucleus pulposus (NP), annulus fibrosus (AF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on T2WI in sagittal position was measured, respectively. The ratio of signal intensity for NP/CSF and AF/CSF was calculated. The tissue of interested and normal vertebral disc was collected and measured by hematoxylin-eosin staining and alcian blue staining (absorbance value). The outcomes of staining were measured by Norbert Boos score. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The anterior and posterior margin of intervertebral height under the injured vertebral body was not significantly different compared with the normal intervertebrae by X-ray (P > 0.05). According to Oner classification, all the vertebral discs under the injured vertebral body of 18 cases were in type I, i.e., the vertebral disc was normal or near-normal, and there were no vertebral disc of type I - V. The signal intensity ratio of AF/CSF, the signal intensity ratio of NF/CSF for the vertebral disc under the injured vertebral body displayed no significant differences compared with the normal ratio of NF/CSF (P > 0.05). Norbert Boos histological score and the absorbance values of alcian blue staining of the interested vertebral disc were similar to the normal one (P > 0.05). The vertebral disc under the injured vertebral body remained no obvious damage, and the structure was examined by X-ray, CT, and MR. Histological analysis shows that the vertebral disc could be preserved.

77955079199	Antegrade intramedulla ry nailing versus retrograde intramedullary nailing for humeral shaft fracture in 18 cases	BACKGROUND: Intramedullary nailing in treatment of humeral shaft fractures prevents plate implantation-induced stress shield or radial nerve injury, and accords with modern minimally invasive orthopedics. It has become a biological internal fixation method. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness between antegrade and retrograde intramedullary nailing for the treatment of humeral shaft fractures. METHODS: A total of 18 patients with humeral shaft fractures were treated with Russell-Taylor nail, including 10 antegrade nailing and 8 retrograde nailing. The shoulder function was evaluated using X-ray examination. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 14 patients were followed-up for 8-15 months, including 8 of antegrade nailing and 6 of retrograde nailing. The shoulder function was excellent in 5 cases, good in 2 cases and fair in 1 case undergoing antegrade nailing; excellent in 5 and good in 1 undergoing retrograde nailing. Antegrade and retrograde nailing have similar treatment results, which reduce radial nerve injury, decrease trauma, and fix well. However, antegrade nailing can injury rotator cuff, and retrograde nailing may lead to bone breakage. Therefore, they may be good alternatives for the treatment of humeral shaft fractures according to the condition of patients.

77955925949	Therapeutic effects and prognostic factors in high-intensity focused ultrasound combined with chemoembolisation for larger hepatocellular carcinoma	The purpose of this study is to evaluate high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) in the treatment of larger hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Eighty-nine (89) patients with unrespectable larger HCC were randomised into a TACE group (n = 45) and a TACE plus HIFU group (n = 44). Therapeutic effects were assessed at follow-up with physical examination, level of serum α-fetoprotein and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. All patients were followed up to observe long-term therapeutic effects and evaluated prognostic factors for survival. No severe complication was observed. Follow-up images showed that total effective rate in tumour response accounted for 72.8% in the TACE-HIFU group, which were significantly higher than that of TACE group (44.5%, P < 0.05). The 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates for the TACE-HIFU group were 72.7%, 50.0%, 31.8% and 11.4%, respectively; correspondingly, for the TACE group were 47.2%, 16.7%, 2.8% and 0%, respectively (P < 0.01). The 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival rates for the TACE-HIFU group were 34.1%, 18.2%, 9.1% and 0%, respectively; correspondingly, for the TACE group were 13.9%, 5.6%, 0% and 0%, respectively (P < 0.01). TNM stage, portal vein tumour thrombosis and Child-Pugh classification each had a significant effect on the survival. HIFU ablation combined with TACE is safe, effective and a promising approach for the treatment of larger HCC. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77957139141	Public health status and influence factors after 2008 Wenchuan earthquake among survivors in Sichuan province, China: Cross-sectional trial	Objectives: On 12 May 2008, an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.0 on the Richter scale struck in Sichuan province, China. After the disaster, approximately 5 million people were living in temporary shelters. The objectives of this study were: (1) to provide the basic information on public health outcomes among the survivors; (2) to compare these outcomes between counties affected to differing extents by the earthquake; and (3) to identify important policies and programmes associated with public health outcomes. Study design: Cross-sectional multicluster sample surveys were employed using data collected from two counties. Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in August 2008 in two counties in Sichuan province. The study outcomes [physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)] were measured using Short Form-12. Independent demographic, socio-economic and trauma exposure variables were also measured. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to investigate associations between the independent variables and PCS and MCS outcomes. Results: In total, 3862 interviews were completed in the two counties. The mean PCS score was 37.6 [95% confidence interval (95% CI 35.13-41.97) in Beichuan county and 45.4 (95% CI 44.30-45.95) in Langzhong county. MCS scores were 36.8 (95% CI 33.61-40.71) in Beichuan county and 49.6 (95% CI 49.69-50.01) in Langzhong county, well below the instrument norm of 50. Variables with negative associations with physical or mental health included: female gender, living in a temporary shelter, higher income, deaths among family/friends, family property damaged and illness within the past 2 weeks. Higher frequencies of trauma exposure (more than six trauma exposure events) showed a strong significant negative association with PCS and MCS in both counties. Conclusions: Interventions should be designed to focus on people without a household income (or a lower income), living in shelters or temporary houses. Governments should support income-generating activities and improve living conditions and public health status. © 2010 The Royal Society for Public Health.

78349285193	Radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors by using monopolar perfusion electrode: An analysis of therapeutic results	Objective: To investigate the clinical value of CT-guided radiofrequency ablation by using monopolar perfusion electrode in treating liver tumors. Methods: From January 2008 to December 2008, 24 patients with 37 lesions of liver tumors were treated with radiofrequency ablation by using monopolar perfusion electrode (RITA UniBlate). Of the 24 patients, solitary lesion was seen in 14, two lesions in 7 and three lesions in 3. Among 37 lesions, the maximum diameter of the lesion ≤ 3 cm, 3.1 - 5 cm and > 5 cm was determined in 24, 8 and 5, respectively. The changes of the tumor size and the AFP level were observed. A follow-up lasting for 12 months was conducted. Results: After radiofrequency ablation twenty-two lesions (22/37, 59.5%) were completely ablated, of which nineteen tumors (19/24, 79.2%) were smaller than 3cm in diameter, two tumors (2/8, 25%) had a diameter between 3.1cm and 5cm, one tumor (1/5, 20%) was larger than 5cm. Fifteen tumors (15/37, 40.5%) were not completely ablated. During the follow-up period of 12 months, fifteen patients (15/24, 62.5%) remained alive and nine patients died, of whom the survival time was less than 6 months in six and was 6-12 months in 4. After radiofrequency ablation, the AFP level decreased to normal level in 5 patients (5/10, 50%), and mild decrease of AFP, but still higher than normal, was seen in 3 patients (3/10, 30%). Of 10 patients who had a positive AFP test, 2 (2/10, 10%) showed a continuous rise in the AFP level. After radiofrequency ablation, one patient developed a minor hepatic subcapsular bleeding, and all patients complained of different degrees of fever and upper abdominal pain. Conclusion: CT-guided radiofrequency ablation by using monopolar perfusion electrode is a minimally-invasive technique with reliable short-term results and fewer complications. Therefore, it is a safe and effective local treatment for liver cancer. For tumors smaller than 3cm in diameter complete ablation can be achieved in most cases, while for tumors larger than 3cm in diameter multi-point overlapping ablation technique together with other means of ablation management should be employed in order to get a complete ablation of the tumor.

79954996486	Comparison of microwave ablation and multipolar radiofrequency ablation, both using a pair of internally cooled interstitial applicators: Results in ex vivo porcine livers	Purpose: To compare the effectiveness of microwave ablation (MWA) and multipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in ex vivo porcine livers, in both cases using a pair of internally cooled interstitial applicators. Materials and methods: MWA was performed on ex vivo porcine livers (n=60) using a pair of simultaneously powered, internally cooled shaft interstitial antennae. Four power settings were used: 50W, 60W, 70W and 80W (n=15 per setting). Multipolar RFA was also performed on ex vivo porcine livers (n=30), also using a pair of simultaneously powered, internally cooled shaft interstitial bipolar applicators. This was performed for two applicator types T30 (3cm length) and T40 (4cm length) at a manufacturer prescribed power of 60W and 80W, respectively (n=15 per applicator). Spacing between the two probes was 2cm in all cases. Each power setting was applied for 15 ablations for 10min each. The long-axis diameter (Dl), short-axis diameter (Ds) and the ratio Ds/Dl for each ablation were measured. Temperature data were recorded at 10 positions. Temperature curves were recorded at 3 locations, as well as the time required for the temperature to rise to 50°C. Results: Dl and Ds for all the power settings of MWA were significantly larger than that of both kinds of multipolar RFA (P<0.05). The rates of temperature to rise to 50°C in all the MW ablations power settings were significantly faster than those in both multipolar RF ablations. Conclusion: MWA by the simultaneous application of double antennae may be more advantageous for treating larger liver tumour than multipolar RFA. © 2011 Informa UK Ltd.

METHODS: A total of 63 patients with unresectable large HCC were treated with TACE followed by PEA. The largest dimension of the tumors ranged from 5.3 cm to 17.8 cm. The survival rates, acute effects, toxicity and prognostic factors were analyzed. RESULTS: The cumulative survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 59.4%, 28.4% and 15.8%, respectively (a median survival of 27.7 mo). Tumor area was reduced by more than 50% in 30 (47.6%) cases. In 56 cases with increased α-fetoprotein (AFP) values, AFP level was declined by more than 75%. The combined therapy was generally well tolerated. Only two patients died from variceal bleeding associated with the therapy. The Cox proportional hazards model showed that the number of tumors, the tumor margin and the ethanol dose were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: The combined TACE and PEA therapy is a promising approach for unresectable large HCC. © 2011 Baishideng. All rights reserved. © 2011 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

80053633614	Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings of peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the head and neck	Purpose: We aimed to analyze the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) of the head and neck. Methods: Eight patients with pPNET of the head and neck confirmed by histopathological examination were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The average patient age was 8 years. The tumor location in the 8 patients was as follows: maxillofacial region (right, 2; left, 1), left maxillary sinus (1), right masticator space (1), left carotid space (1), right infratemporal fossa (1), and left parotid gland (1). All 5 patients who underwent CT demonstrated ill-defined soft masses and no calcification. Three patients with tumors in the maxillofacial region showed homogeneous small masses and a mild enhancement. The patient with left maxillary sinus tumor showed a heterogeneous mass with patchy, necrotic foci and mild heterogeneous enhancement. The patient with right masticator space tumor showed a heterogeneous mass, and marked heterogeneous enhancement. The T1-weighted images of the patients with right infratemporal fossa, left carotid space, and left parotid gland tumors were isointense. The T2-weighted images were heterogeneous and mildly hyperintense in 2 patients and hyperintense in 1 patient. Heterogeneous intermediate enhancement was demonstrated in 2 patients and mild ring enhancement in 1 patient. Conclusion: The imaging features of pPNET of the head and neck are non-specific. An ill-defined, aggressive mass and variable enhancement on CT and MR images may suggest the diagnosis of pPNET. Peripheral PNET should be included in the differential diagnosis of children and adolescents' regional tumors. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

80054870540	Microwave ablation: Results in ex vivo and in vivo porcine livers with 2450-MHz cooled-shaft antenna	Background Imaging-guided thermal ablation using different energy sources continues to gain favor as a minimally invasive technique for the treatment of primary and metastatic hepatic malignant tumors. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of microwave ablation with 2450-MHz internally cooled-shaft antenna in ex vivo and in vivo porcine livers. Methods All studies were animal care and ethics committee approved. Microwave ablation was performed using a noncooled or cooled-shaft antenna in 23 ex vivo (92 ablations) and eight in vivo (36 ablations) porcine livers. Diameters of the coagulation zone were observed on gross specimens. The coagulation diameters achieved in different microwave ablation parameter groups were compared. Curve estimation analysis was performed to characterize the relationship between applied power and treatment duration and coagulation diameter (including short-axis and long-axis diameter). Results Coagulation zones were elliptical and an arrowed-shaped carbonization zone around the shaft was observed in all groups. But the antenna track was also coagulated in the noncooled-shaft antenna groups. In ex vivo livers, the short-axis diameter correlated with the power output in a quadratic curve fashion (R2=0.95) by fixing ablation duration to 10 minutes, and correlated with the ablation duration in a logarithmic curve fashion (R2=0.98) by fixing power output to 80 W. The short-axis reached a relative plateau within 25 minutes. In in vivo livers, short-axis diameter correlated with the coagulation duration in a sigmoidal curve fashion (60 W group R2=0.76, 80 W group R2=0.87), with a relative plateau achieved within 10 minutes for power settings of 60 W and 80 W. Conclusions The internally cooled microwave antenna may be advantageous to minimize collateral damage. The short-axis diameter enlargement has a plateau by fixing power output.

80455164791	Exploring China's western and central county systems performance measured by outcomes framework scores - A cross-sectional survey of routine healthcare data	This study was designed to measure the performance of county health systems in central and western China utilizing routine healthcare data. Drawing on a literature review and expert consultation, the study established a theoretical framework and an indicator system for performance review. Questionnaires were designed and disseminated to collect empirical data on health system performance in four counties of two central and western provinces. Quantitative data were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis through SPSS12.0. Three dimensions were introduced in the performance review framework-health outcomes, financial risk protection and consumer and provider satisfaction. Health outcomes were assessed from four secondary indicators: infant mortality rate; maternal mortality rate; under-5 child mortality rate; and the incidence of Class A and Class B notifiable diseases. Financial risk was assessed using two secondary indicators: the proportion of the cost of inpatient care that was reimbursed under the New Cooperative Medical System (NCMS) insurance scheme, and the rate of NCMS funds utilization. The assessment of satisfaction was made using two secondary indicators: the overall satisfaction of local residents with healthcare services, and the satisfaction of health practitioners at the township and village level. The study indicated better health system performance in the two counties in Chongqing than those in Shanxi. It was concluded that outcome framework scores can fairly reveal performance differences among county health systems in central and western China, and can provide practical evidence for optimizing the operation and inputs of county health systems. Caution needs to be exercised in generalizing such performance outcomes as many factors such as spending and organization that contribute to county health system performance were not included in the study. © Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

80555155599	CT-guided percutaneous microwave ablation of adrenal malignant carcinoma: Preliminary results	BACKGROUND: Microwave ablation has recently been developed as a safe and effective treatment for a variety of tumors. The authors evaluated the safety and efficacy of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous microwave ablation of adrenal malignant tumors. METHODS: Nine patients between 41 and 83 years of age (average age, 54 years) with adrenal carcinoma (a total of 10 lesions) received CT-guided percutaneous water-cooled microwave ablation. The 9 cases included 1 primary adrenocortical carcinoma and 8 metastatic carcinomas (4 from lung cancer, 2 from hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 1 from left tibial osteosarcoma). Of the 8 metastatic cases, 7 were unilateral, and 1 was bilateral. All cases were pathologically confirmed by aspiration biopsy or postsurgical biopsy. The tumor diameters ranged from 2.1 cm to 6.1 cm (average, 3.8 cm). The average number of ablation sites was 1.5 sites (1-3 sites), and the average accumulated ablation time was 7.7 minutes (4-15 minutes). The procedures were performed using a cooled-shaft antenna. RESULTS: The patients were followed for 3-37 months, with an average of 11.3 months. Nine of 10 lesions were completely necrotized after first treatment. The other lesion was completely necrotized after 2 treatments. One of the patients experienced hypertensive crisis during treatment. No patient experienced recurrent tumor at the treated site, and this lack of recurrence indicated effective local control. All patients had progression of metastatic disease at extra-adrenal sites. CONCLUSIONS: CT-guided percutaneous water-cooled microwave ablation is a minimally invasive and effective method for the treatment of adrenal carcinoma. Cancer © 2011 American Cancer Society.

80755189013	Total Hip Arthroplasty for Failed Treatment of Acetabular Fractures. A 5-Year Follow-Up Study	Total hip arthroplasty (THA) remains an available surgical option for failed treatment of acetabular fractures. We retrospectively analyzed 53 patients who underwent THA because of failed treatment of acetabular fractures. The mean duration of follow-up monitoring was 64 months (range, 32-123 months) in 49 patients. The average Harris hip score increased from 49.5 before surgery to 90.1 at the latest follow-up examination. Postoperative complications included 1 dislocation, 3 sciatic nerve injuries, and 3 class III instances of heterotopic ossification. There was only 1 revision due to aseptic loosening of the acetabular and femoral component. Despite the technically demanding nature of the procedure, the results of acetabular reconstruction are encouraging in these patients; complication rates are low, and patient satisfaction level is high. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

84455209459	Comparison of microwave ablation and multipolar radiofrequency ablation in vivo using two internally cooled probes	OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to compare the effectiveness of microwave ablation (MWA) and multipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in vivo using two internally cooled probes. MATERIALS AND METHODS. MWA (n = 24) was performed by simultaneous application of double internally cooled-shaft antennae. Three power settings (60, 70, and 80 W) were used. Multipolar RFA (n = 16) was also performed by simultaneously using two internally cooled bipolar applicators (lengths: 3-cm T30 and 4-cm T40) at 60 and 80 W. Probe spacing was 2 cm. Each power setting was applied for eight ablations with a 10-minute duration for each. The cooled-shaft probes were inserted approximately 7 cm into the liver parenchyma of seven adult Wuzhishan pigs under ultrasound guidance, and ablations were performed in various segments of porcine liver. The long-axis diameter (Dl), short-axis diameter (Ds) and the ratio Ds/Dl for each ablation was measured. Temperature curves at 0, 2, and 3 cm from the middle of the two probes and the time to reach 60°C at 0 cm from the parallel central line between the two probes were recorded. RESULTS. The long-axis diameter and short-axis diameter for all the power settings of MWA were significantly larger than that of both kinds of multipolar RFA (p < 0.05). The rates of temperature rise to 60°C at 0 cm from the parallel central line between the two probes for all MWA power settings were significantly faster compared with RFA. CONCLUSION. MWA, by the simultaneous application of double antennae, can generate a larger ablation zone, in vivo, compared with multipolar RFA. © American Roentgen Ray Society.

84875063688	Hospital availability in rural districts of China - A secondary data analysis on multiple Utilisation of hospital services under the conditions of the Chinese medical health-care system	Background: The study explores the necessity to develop and to implement a sufficient referral system of patients for hospital care in rural China. Current rules of utilising hospital care result in a lack of effectiveness and quality due to fragmentation and insufficient exchange of patients' data, but particularly when the providing hospital has to be changed during one diagnosis-related care cycle. The study aims to describe patterns and diseases of particular concern regarding the lacking exchange of data between different providers leading to the disintegration and fragmentation of services. Material and Methods: For the purpose of this study data from the Cooperative Medical System for Urban and Rural Residents were collected in 2010. From a total of 443 355 enrollees a total of 29 062 was admitted to hospital at least once. That is an admission rate of 6.6%. Among these patients, those were counted who had changed the hospital within the same treatment cycle. Results: 1 199 inpatients from the total of 29 062 changed the provider during the same disease cycle (4.12%), and they caused a total of 35 866 visits. 2 547 visits were due to patients who changed hospital during the disease-related treatment cycle. About 75% of these inpatients were aged from 30 to 75 years. Distinguishing providing hospitals into higher and lower level ones, those inpatients moving "upwardso" are mainly vulnerable to respiratory diseases while the inpatients moving "downwardso" are mainly suffering from injury and poisoning. The simple linear correlation result shows that the capacity of providing hospitalisation service of low-level medical institutions might have an impact on the standardised number of the "upwardo" referred inpatients. Conclusion: A health service system with different levels of provision is badly in need of a sufficient referral mechanism, if it is intended to integrate competence and to save recourses. This raises fundamentally the problem of the providers' interests in cooperation, if the frames that are guiding them are influenced by economic incentives and market mechanisms. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

0141988676	Human epithelial cancers secrete immunoglobulin G with unidentified specificity to promote growth and survival of tumor cells	Immunoglobulins (Igs) are found thus far only to be produced by differentiated B lymphocytes. By immunohistochemistry analysis, in situ hybridization, and laser capture microdissection-assisted single-cell PCR, we demonstrate that human cancers of epithelial origin, including carcinomas of breast, colon, liver, lung, established epithelial cancer lines, as well as some normal lung tissues, also produce IgG in both cytoplasmic and secreted forms. Furthermore, blockade of tumor-derived IgG by either antisense DNA or antihuman IgG antibody increased programmed cell death and inhibited growth of cancer cells in vitro. More importantly, administration of antihuman IgG antibody also suppressed the growth of an IgG-secreting carcinoma line in immunodeficient nude mice. Our results support a role of tumor-derived IgG as growth factor for epithelial cancers. Prevalent expression of IgG in human carcinomas and its growth-promoting functions may have important implications in growth regulation and targeted therapy of human cancers.

13844314852	Inhibition of BN IL-1β-induced fever and effects on cAMP in POA and plasma	Aim: To study the effects of Bombesin (BN) on hypothermia of rats and its relation with cAMP. Methods: SD male rats were dealed with intracerebroventricular administration of bombesin and IL-1β. Change in body temperature was measured and content of cAMP in hypothalamus and plasma was detected. Results: (1)In the febrile rats induced by icv. injection of IL-1β, cAMP level in POA and plasma was significantly higher ( P <0.01, P <0.01); (2)Bombesin reduced normal body temperature of the rats. cAMP level was lower (P <0.01, P <0.05); (3) Fever induced by IL-1β was inhibited by pretreatment with bombesin, and cAMP level was lower compared with the control group (P <0.01, P<0.05). Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that bombesin could inhibit IL-1β induced fever, and the mechanism might be by inhibition of cAMP synthesis.
