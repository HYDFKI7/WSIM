15944388966	Selective portal vein clamping for radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion	Surgical resection provides potential cure for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Unfortunately, resection is suitable in only about 10-37% of patients because of the limited hepatic functional reserve from the underlying chronic liver disease in the majority of patients. Survival of patients with unresectable diseases, especially those with portal vein tumor invasion, remains very poor. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a form of locoregional therapy that allows a selected group of previously inoperable patients to be treated. However, problems with RFA leading to induced portal vein thrombosis have been reported in the literature. Nevertheless, patients with portal vein tumor invasion may be considered for radiofrequency tumor ablation to improve survival. We report the case of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma with left portal vein invasion. Complete tumor ablation was achieved after RFA with left portal vein clamping. He remained disease free both radiologically and biochemically 6 months after the operation. © 2005 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.

14344258798	Comparison of systemic responses of radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, and surgical resection in a porcine liver model	Background: The degree of systemic response after hepatic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has not been well investigated. Methods: An in vivo study was conducted on 23 domestic swine. Different hepatic procedures (RFA, cryotherapy, hepatic pedicle ligation, and hepatectomy) were performed on the medial lobe of the liver (30% of the liver volume). Systemic responses in terms of systemic inflammatory marker changes and end-organ functions were determined. Results: During the early postoperative period, the systemic inflammatory marker concentrations (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β) in the RFA group were significantly lower than in the cryotherapy group but significantly higher than in the control group. The corresponding concentrations in the hepatectomy group remained similar to those in the control group. The pattern of changes of serum inflammatory marker concentrations in the pedicle ligation group followed the pattern in the RFA group. The serum intracellular content concentrations (lactate dehydrogenase and urate) of the cryotherapy group peaked at 6 hours after operation, which was significantly later than in the other groups. Liver function, renal function, and coagulation profiles remained normal in the RFA group. However, the renal function deteriorated in the cryotherapy group on day 1. Both platelet count and activated clotting time showed significant derangement in the cryotherapy group compared with the control group. There was more severe interstitial pneumonitic change of the porcine lung after cryotherapy than after RFA. Conclusions: The systemic responses of RFA were significantly less severe than those of cryotherapy in this porcine model. However, the increase in serum inflammatory markers and pneumonitis after RFA was substantial when compared with hepatectomy. © 2004 The Society of Surgical Oncology, Inc.

1542329567	Prevalence and characteristics of familial hepatocellular carcinoma caused by chronic hepatitis B infection in Hong Kong	Background: Hepatitis B virus infection is an important aetiological factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Clusters of hepatocellular carcinoma have been observed in families infected with hepatitis B virus. Aim: To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with familial hepatitis B virus in Hong Kong. Methods: Hepatitis B virus patients were screened for familial hepatocellular carcinoma using a standardized questionnaire. The clinical features of patients with familial hepatocellular carcinoma were compared with those of 118 patients with sporadic hepatocellular carcinoma attending the clinic during the same period. Results: A total of 5080 patients were interviewed. Validation of the questionnaire indicated that the reliability was high. There were 22 families with familial hepatocellular carcinoma, giving a prevalence of 4.3 families/1000 hepatitis B virus carriers. The mean age of onset was 48.5 ± 13 years in familial hepatocellular carcinoma and 62 ± 11 years in sporadic hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.005). The ages of onset were 59 ± 11, 40 ± 10 and 18 ± 4 years in the first, second and third generations, respectively (P < 0.0001), suggesting an anticipation phenomenon. Familial hepatocellular carcinoma patients were more likely to present with pain (70% vs. 10%,P < 0.0001), but not on routine screening (14% vs. 52%, P < 0.0001), than sporadic hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Conclusion: The prevalence of familial hepatocellular carcinoma is significant in Hong Kong. These patients show specific clinical features when compared with patients with sporadic hepatocellular carcinoma.

1642268463	Learning Curve for Radiofrequency Ablation of Liver Tumors: Prospective Analysis of Initial 100 Patients in a Tertiary Institution	Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effect of operator experience on the treatment outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for malignant liver tumors. Summary Background Data: RFA is gaining popularity as the ablative therapy of choice for liver tumors. It is generally considered a simple and safe technique, and little attention has been paid to the importance of operator experience in this treatment. A learning curve in this treatment modality has not been documented before. Patients and Methods: The clinical data and treatment outcomes of the initial 100 patients undergoing RFA for liver tumors (hepatocellular carcinoma, n = 84; metastasis, n = 15; cholangiocarcinoma n = 1) were collected prospectively. All patients were managed by a single team of surgeons and interventional radiologists. The data of the first 50 patients (group I) and the second 50 patients (group II) were compared. Results: RFA was performed by percutaneous (group I, n = 22; group II, n = 19), open (group I, n = 26; group II, n = 30) or laparoscopic (group I, n = 2; group II, n = 1) approach. In group I, 30 patients (60%) had a solitary tumor and 20 (40%) had multiple tumors; in group II, 35 patients (70%) had a solitary tumor and 15 (30%) had multiple tumors (P = 0.295). The size of the largest tumor was comparable between groups I and II (median, 2.8 cm in both groups; P = 0.508). Group II had significantly shorter hospital stay (median, 4.0 versus 5.5 days; P = 0.048), lower morbidity rate (4% versus 16%; P = 0.046) and higher complete ablation rate (100% versus 85.7%; P = 0.006) than group I. There was 1 hospital death (2%) in group I and 0 in group II. By multivariate analysis, treatment period (group I versus group II) was an independent significant factor affecting the morbidity rate and complete ablation rate. Conclusions: A low complication rate and a high complete ablation rate could be achieved with the accumulated experience from the first 50 cases of RFA for liver tumors by a specialized team. This study demonstrates that there is a significant learning curve in RFA for liver tumors.

1442336120	Effectiveness of Radiofrequency Ablation for Hepatocellular Carcinomas Larger Than 3 cm in Diameter	Hypothesis: Radiofrequency ablation is a safe and effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinomas 3.1 to 8.0 cm in diameter. Design: Case series with prospective data collection. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: Eighty-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with radiofrequency ablation from May 1, 2001, to December 31, 2002, were placed into categories of those with tumors 3 cm or smaller (group 1, n=51) and those with tumors 3.1 to 8.0 cm (group 2, n=35) in diameter. Interventions: Radiofrequency ablation was performed with a single or cluster cool-tip electrode. The choice of treatment route was based on tumor size and position. Main Outcome Measures: Complication, treatment mortality, and complete ablation rates. Results: Radiofrequency ablation was performed percutaneously in 26 patients in group 1 and 9 patients in group 2, with laparoscopy in 2 patients in group 1 and 1 patient in group 2, and with open operation in 23 patients in group 1 and 25 patients in group 2. The complication rates were 12% and 17% in group 1 and group 2, respectively (P=.48); treatment mortality rates were 0% and 3%, respectively (P=.41). Complete ablation rates after a single session of ablation assessed by means of computed tomography 1 month after treatment were 94% and 91% in group 1 and group 2, respectively (P=.68). Conclusion: Radiofrequency ablation is a safe and effective treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinomas 3.1 to 8.0 cm in diameter.

1642355178	Impact of radiofrequency ablation on the management of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in a specialized centre	Background: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been used increasingly in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the treatment pattern of primary HCC following the implementation of RFA in a specialized surgical centre. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of all 894 patients admitted for treatment of primary HCC over 36 months. Results: There was no difference in the age, sex ratio, liver function according to Child-Pugh grade, serum α-fetoprotein concentration, hepatitis B surface antigen status and tumour size among patients before and after the introduction of RFA therapy. Fifty-one patients (10.6 per cent) with primary HCC received RFA treatment after its implementation. There was a 6.8 per cent reduction in the number of patients who had supportive treatment (P = 0.041) and a 3.2 per cent reduction in surgical treatment. The hospital mortality rates for RFA and surgery were 2.0 and 4.9 per cent respectively. The overall survival rates at 6, 12 and 18 months for patients treated with RFA were 92.2, 73.4 and 61.2 per cent respectively. The corresponding survival rates for the 213 patients who had surgery were 88.0, 77.0 and 71.5 per cent. These values were no different from those in patients who had RFA (P = 0.718). Patients treated with RFA or surgery survived longer than those who had other treatments. Conclusion: RFA had a significant impact on the management of primary HCC, increasing the number of patients suitable for liver-directed therapy and leading to survival benefit. RFA may become the treatment of choice for patients with irresectable HCC.

18144423178	The relationship between hypertension and anxiety or depression in Hong Kong Chinese	Background: Psychosocial stress can be the cause or the consequence of hypertension. Objective: To study the association between hypertension and anxiety or depression in adults from Hong Kong, China. Subjects and methods: Patients with diagnosed hypertension (n=197) were recruited to complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. The control group comprised 182 normotensive subjects recruited using random telephone numbers. Results: The score in the anxiety subscale (HADS-A) of the HADS correlated with age (r= -0.23, P<0.001) and sex (r=0.11, P=0.042), and was found to be higher in women. The score in the depression subscale (HADS-D) correlated with age (r=0.17, P=0.003) and hypertension (r=0.12, P=0.039), but not with sex (r=0.02, P=0.68). When the control subjects were matched for sex and age with the subjects with hypertension, the mean HADS-A score was 5.51±0.41 in 113 hypertensive subjects and 4.38±0.39 in 113 normotensive subjects (P=0.047). The mean HADS-D score was 5.56±0.39 in the hypertensive and 4.76±0.32 in the normotensive subjects (P=0.11). Multiple regression analysis using data from both groups indicated that the HADS-A score was related to the HADS-D score (β=0.49, P<0.001), age (β= -0.25, P<0.001) and sex (β=0.12, P=0.01) (R

1842867056	Validation of POSSUM scoring systems for audit of major hepatectomy	Background: The aim of the study was to validate the use of Physiological and Operative Severity Score in the enumeration of Mortality and morbidity (POSSUM) and Portsmouth (P) POSSUM scoring systems to predict postoperative mortality in a group of Chinese patients who had a major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on data collected prospectively over a 6-year interval from January 1997 to December 2002. The mortality risks were calculated using both the POSSUM and the P-POSSUM equations. Results: Two hundred and fifty-nine patients underwent major hepatectomy; there were 17 (6-6 per cent) postoperative deaths. Of 32 preoperative and intraoperative variables studied, age, smoking habit, serum creatinine concentration, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, and physiological and operative severity scores were found to be significant factors predicting mortality. On multivariate analysis only the physiological and operative severity scores were independent variables. The POSSUM system overpredicred mortality risk (14-2 per cent) and there was a significant lack of fit in these patients (X

1942534221	Different presentation of hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma in a cohort of 1863 young and old patients - Implications for screening	Aim: To compare the clinico-pathological features of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma in young and old patients. Methods: The clinico-pathological characteristics of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma were compared in 1863 consecutive patients (121 patients, ≤ 40 years; 1742 patients, > 40 years) seen at a single institution over the last 13 years. Results: Young patients presented more often with pain (P < 0.0001), hepatomegaly (P = 0.01) and ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.02), whereas old patients presented with ankle oedema (P = 0.001), ascites (P = 0.002) and by routine screening (P = 0.035). Liver function, Child-Pugh grading and indocyanine green test were better preserved in young patients. They also had a higher α-foetoprotein concentration (P = 0.001), larger tumour size (P = 0.001) and more frequent metastasis (P = 0.008), but a similar surgical resection rate (33.6% vs. 28%), to old patients. There was no difference between the two groups in the overall post-resection survival rate, but there was a shorter survival in young patients with unresectable disease (3.6 months vs. 4.6 months, P = 0.004). Conclusion: Young patients with hepatocellular carcinoma often show a later presentation, but a higher resectability rate and similar survival rates, than old patients. The screening programme should include young hepatitis B virus carriers, even in the absence of cirrhosis.

20844460628	Better survival in female patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: Oral contraceptive pills related?	Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has an indisputable male predominance. "Gender" as an independent prognostic factor for survival is, however, controversial. Goals: Determine the influence of gender on survival in HCC patients, and identify factors that may account for the difference. Methods: A retrospective analysis on a prospectively collected database in a 15-year period, from 1989 to 2003. Results: A total of 3,171 HCC patients were managed in our institution (946 with curative treatment, 1,388 with palliative treatment, and 837 with supportive treatment) and studied. Female patients (n = 520) were 4.3 years older (P = 0.000), had a lower proportion of smokers and drinkers (P = 0.000), and were less likely to be hepatitis B carriers (P = 0.000). There was no difference in Child-Pugh status, tumor size, and the use of different treatments between genders. The overall median survival was 25.7 months longer in females after curative treatment (73.6 vs. 47.9 months; P = 0.012). The survival benefit in female patients was observed in early-stage diseases and persisted when only hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients were analyzed (96.4 vs. 47.9 months; P = 0.044). With multivariate analysis, gender, indocyanine green test value at 15 minutes, number of tumor nodules, size of tumor, major vascular invasion, invasion of adjacent organs, and tumor rupture were the independent variables for survival. More importantly, in female patients, history of using oral contraceptive was an independent factor with survival benefit (P = 0.004). Conclusion: Gender is an independent variable for survival after curative treatment of HCC. A survival benefit was observed in females. History of using oral contraceptive is associated with a better long-term survival in female patients. Copyright © 2005 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

21244480992	Gallbladder cancer presenting with acute cholecystitis: A population-based study	Background: The role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in acute cholecystitis remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine the incidence, clinicopathological characteristics, and outcome of patients with gallbladder cancer presenting with acute cholecystitis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with gallbladder cancer who presented with acute cholecystitis and were treated at the public hospitals in Hong Kong between 1998 and 2002. Results: Among 2,700 patients with acute cholecystitis managed with cholecystectomy (1,347 open and 1,353 LC), 63 patients (2.3%) were found to have gallbladder cancer. There were 44 women and 19 men with a mean age of 74.7 (±12.8) years. Adenocarcinoma (90.5%) was the most common cancer. The overall median survival was 5 months (95% CI = 2.6-7.4). The 5-year survival rate was 20.8%. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted in 11 patients and was completed successfully in six of them. There was no difference between the LC and open groups in the complication rate, hospital mortality rate, or survival rate. Conclusions: In the ethnic Chinese population of Hong Kong, the incidence of gallbladder cancer presenting with acute cholecystitis is higher than the same finding in patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis. Long-term survival is possible because such patients may be diagnosed at an early stage of the disease. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.

21644435666	Inguinal hernia repair in Hospital Authority hospitals: The role of laparoscopic hernioplasty	Objective: Two major changes have occurred in inguinal hernia repair during the last two decades: (i) the use of tension-free mesh repair; and (ii) the application of laparoscopic technique for repair. The aims of the present study were to study: (i) how inguinal hernia repair was carried out; and (ii) the outcome of inguinal hernia repair in Hospital Authority (HA) hospitals. Methodology: This was a retrospective analysis on 8311 elective inguinal hernia repairs performed in 16 HA hospitals from January 2001 to December 2003. The mean age was 63.9 ± 14.2 years, and the male to female ratio was 22.0: 1.0. Among these, 869 (10.5%) repairs were performed with the laparoscopic approach and 7442 (89.5%) repairs with the open approach. The proportion of laparoscopic hernia repair increased from 8.7% to 12.6%. Results: For open repair, 39% of cases were carried out with regional anaesthesia, 32% with general anaesthesia and 29% with local anaesthesia (LA). Furthermore, mesh repair was used in 88% of the patients. For laparosocpic repair, 98.4% of cases were carried out under general anaesthesia, and all patients had mesh repair using the totally extraperitoneal approach. A significantly higher proportion of bilateral repair and recurrent hernia repair was performed with the laparoscopic approach (P = 0.000). For primary unilateral repair, there was no significant difference in the postoperative length of stay (LOS) and the total LOS between the laparoscopic and the open surgery groups. No difference in LOS was found in recurrent hernia repair between the two groups. With respect to bilateral repair, both the preoperative LOS (P = 0.036) and total LOS (P = 0.039) were shorter in the laparoscopic group. Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of day-surgery patients was observed in the laparoscopic group than the open surgery group (21.3% vs 16.9%, P = 0.001). Nevertheless, when only the results of 2003 were analyzed, the postoperative LOS (P = 0.000) and total LOS (P = 0.000) were significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group than the open surgery group. The LOS parameters were significantly shorter in the open surgery LA subgroup compared with the non-LA subgroup (P = 0.000), and they were not different from those in the laparoscopic group. Conclusions: The open mesh repair is the predominant approach for inguinal hernia repair in HA hospitals. The originally described local anaesthetic approach was under utilized, although it resulted in good outcome. The use of laparoscopic hernia repair is increasing and a learning curve was recently observed with improved outcome.

0008285207	Needle implantation cryoprobes: Biophysical and thermal characteristics	There has been increased recent interest in hepatic cryosurgery for primary and metastatic tumors in the liver. This has been realized through technological advances in intraoperative ultrasound monitoring and cryoprobe technology. Purpose-designed needle implantable cryoprobes have been developed to freeze deep-seated tumors in the hepatic parenchyma. However, the biophysical and thermal characteristics of these implantable cryoprobes have not been studied. This article discusses the biophysical and thermal characteristics of recently developed high-efficiency, implantable needle cryoprobes that can be used laparoscopically. The cryolesion was formed along the whole length of the cryoprobe implanted into hepatic tissue. It was cylindrical in shape and extended 8 mm beyond the tip of the cryoprobe after 20 minutes of freezing. During this period of freezing, the volume of the cryolesion increased in a near constant manner, but the diameter increased in a logarithmic fashion. In addition, single-cycle freezing produced a larger cryolesion than a dual freeze cycle interrupted by a 5-minute thaw. Further, increasing the length of cryoprobe implantation increased the volume of the cryolesion, although the diameter was smaller. The rate of cooling at the tip of the cryoprobe was also faster with partial implantation of the cryoprobe than with complete implantation. The cooling rate varied vertically along the length of the cryoprobe, as well as horizontally from the cryoprobe. Copyright© 1997 by W. B. Saunders Company.

0031691340	Prolonged survival in selected patients following surgical resection for pulmonary metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma	Background - Pulmonary metastasis is the commonest site of extrahepatic spread from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of surgical management in patients with solitary pulmonary metastases from HCC. Methods - This was a retrospective study of patients with HCC admitted for hepatectomy from July 1972 to June 1995. The records of patients who had a pulmonary resection for histologically proven pulmonary recurrence after curative hepatectomy were selected for analysis. Results - In the study interval, 380 patients with HCC underwent hepatectomy. Some 48 patients (12.6 per cent) developed pulmonary metastases documented pathologically or radiologically. Nine (seven men and two women) were suitable for curative pulmonary resection. The median disease free survival between hepatectomy and appearance of the lung metastasis was 21 months. The median survival after pulmonary resection was 42 months, and the 1-, 2- and 5-year survival rates were 100, 78 and 67 per cent respectively. Conclusion - Pulmonary resection for metastases from HCC resulted in long-term survival in these highly selected patients.

0031837080	Hepatic cryosurgery for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy: A preliminary report	Background and Objectives: The treatment of choice for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is repeated resection. However, only a small percentage of patients are suitable for further hepatic resection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical risk and operative outcome of hepatic cryosurgery in patients with recurrent HCC. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with recurrent HCC after previous curative hepatectomy treated with cryosurgery. Four patients with recurrent HCC not suitable for further resection were enrolled for cryosurgery, their clinical parameters, the operative details and outcome were studied. Results: No intraoperative or postoperative complications were noted. The duration of operation ranged from 3-5.2 hr and the operative blood loss from 173-1,300 ml. All patients are still alive with survival after cryosurgery ranging from 12-23 mo (25-63 mo after the hepatic resection). Three patients showed evidence of recurrent disease and one patient was disease free. Conclusions: Hepatic cryosurgery is a safe therapy for patients with unresectable recurrent HCC.

2442591449	Delayed portal vein thrombosis after experimental radiofrequency ablation near the main portal vein	Background: Portal venous blood flow may protect adjacent tumour cells from thermal destruction with radiofrequency ablation (RFA). This study aimed to investigate the local effect of RFA on the main portal vein branch, and the completeness of cellular ablation in its vicinity, with or without a Pringle manoeuvre using a porcine model. Methods: This was an in vivo study on 23 domestic pigs. RFA using a cooled-tip electrode was performed 5 mm from the left main portal vein branch under ultrasonographic guidance for 12 min with (n = 10) or without (n = 10) a Pringle manoeuvre. Ten pigs were killed 4 h after the procedure to study the early effects of RFA and ten others were killed 1 week later to determine any delayed effect. As a control, sham operations with a Pringle manoeuvre for 12 min were performed on three pigs. The flow velocity changes of portal vein and hepatic artery were measured using Doppler ultrasonography, and the completeness of cellular ablation around the portal vein was assessed qualitatively by histochemical staining and quantitatively by measuring intracellular levels of adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP). Results: In the absence of the Pringle manoeuvre, there was no significant change in mean(s.d.) portal vein flow velocity before RFA (20.0(3.5) cm/s) and at 4 h (18.5(2.5) cm/s) (P = 0.210) and 1 week (19.5(2.2) cm/s) (P = 0.500) after the procedure. Gross and histological examination of the portal vein branches showed no damage without the Pringle manoeuvre. In all pigs that underwent RFA with a Pringle manoeuvre, the portal vein was occluded 1 week after the operation; histological examination of the affected portal vein showed severe thermal injury and associated venous thrombosis. The local effect of RFA on the hepatic artery was similar. With intact portal blood flow during RFA, complete ablation of liver tissue around the pedicle was demonstrated by histochemical staining and measurement of the intracellular ATP concentration. Conclusion: RFA was safe when applied close to the main portal vein branch without a Pringle manoeuvre, with complete cellular destruction. Use of the Pringle manoeuvre resulted in delayed portal vein and hepatic artery thrombosis and injury to the hepatic artery and bile duct.

2442674414	Radiofrequency ablation for subcapsular hepatocellular carcinoma	Background: Limited data from recent studies suggested an increased risk of bleeding complications, needle-track seeding, and local recurrence after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of subcapsular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Between May 2001 and October 2002, 80 patients underwent RFA of 104 HCC nodules. Forty-eight patients had subcapsular HCC (group I), whereas the other 32 patients did not have subcapsular HCC (group II). RFA was performed via celiotomy, laparoscopy, or a percutaneous approach. Subcapsular HCCs were ablated by indirect puncture through nontumorous liver, and the needle track was thermocoagulated. Results: There were no significant differences between groups in treatment morbidity (14.6% vs. 15.6%; P = .898), mortality (2.1% vs. 0%; P = 1.000), complete ablation rate after a single session (89.4% vs. 96.9%; P = .392), local recurrence rate (4.3% vs. 12.5%; P = .216), recurrence-free survival (1 year: 60.9% vs. 49.2%; P = .258), or overall survival (1 year: 88.3% vs. 79.4%; P = .441). After a median follow-up of 13 months, no needle-track seeding or intraperitoneal metastasis was observed. Conclusions: This study shows that the results of RFA for subcapsular HCCs are comparable to those of RFA for nonsubcapsular HCCs. Subcapsular HCC should not be considered a contraindication for RFA treatment. © 2004 The Society of Surgical Oncology, Inc.

24044529476	Laparoscopic surgery for common surgical emergencies: A population-based study	Background: Despite being controversial in the past, many reports on the safe use of laparoscopic surgery in emergency settings have been published. The aim of this study was to investigate the diffusion of laparoscopic surgery in three common surgical emergency operations, namely, appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and simple repair of perforated peptic ulcer (PPU), in a stable population. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of the central database of the Hospital Authority (HA) in Hong Kong. Data for patients managed in 14 HA hospitals from 1998 to 2002 were studied. The operation record and discharge record of each patient were also investigated to verify the data. Results: A total of 12,708 patients underwent appendectomy, 2631 patients underwent cholecystectomy, and 2260 patients had simple repair of PPU performed. During the study period, 37.2% of appendectomies, 46.5% of cholecystectomies, and 23.1% of simple repairs of PPU were performed laparoscopically. More than a two-fold increase in the proportion of laparoscopic surgery was observed in each of these three operations. By the end of 2002, the percentage of laparoscopic surgery had increased to 53.5% for appendectomies, 61.3% for cholecystectomies, and 32.9% for simple repairs of PPU. Significantly lower hospital mortality rates and shorter postoperative hospital stay were consistenty observed in patients with laparoscopic surgery of the three emergencies. A wide variation in the use of laparoscopic surgery, ranging from 3.7% to 73.1%, was observed among the 14 HA hospitals. However, there was no correlation in the use of laparoscopic surgery with the volume of operation performed in each hospital (p = 0.933). Conclusion: A high diffusion rate on the use of laparoscopic surgery for common surgical emergency was observed in Hong Kong. However, there was also a wide variation in the diffusion rate among the 14 HA hospitals. Efforts to reduce hospital variation for the better dissemination of safe laparoscopic technique may be warranted. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.

24344463991	Clinico-biochemical prediction of biliary cause of acute pancreatitis in the era of endoscopic ultrasonography	Background: Occult biliary stones escape detection on conventional investigations, and clinico-biochemical systems proposed for predicting biliary pancreatitis has low predictive values. Aim: To evaluate the accuracy of clinico-biochemical parameters for prediction of biliary pancreatitis in patients undergoing endoscopic ultrasonography. Methods: Early endoscopic ultrasonography was performed on 139 patients presenting with acute pancreatitis within 24 h of admission. The aetiologies of all patients were determined after complete evaluations, and clinico-biochemical characteristics of patients with a biliary cause (biliary group) and non-biliary causes (non-biliary group) were compared. Results: Biliary pancreatitis was diagnosed in 107 patients and 32 patients had non-biliary causes. The biliary group belonged to a significantly older age group, had a female predominance, significantly more derangement of liver function and a higher incidence of severe attack of acute pancreatitis. On multivariate analysis, female sex, age >58 years and serum alanine aminotransferase >150 U/L were independent predictive factors for biliary cause of acute pancreatitis. Using these three factors for prediction of biliary cause, the sensitivity was 93% and overall accuracy was 85%. Conclusion: Clinico-biochemical prediction for biliary cause of acute pancreatitis improves in the era of endoscopic ultrasonography with a higher sensitivity and overall accuracy. In centres where endoscopic ultrasonography is inaccessible or local expertise is unavailable, clinico-biochemical prediction of biliary cause of acute pancreatitis may provide a useful alternative in the initial management of this group of patients. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

27944447372	Variation in the use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis: A population-based study	Hypothesis: There is wide variation in the use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for acute cholecystitis among all public hospitals in Hong Kong. The objective of this study was to determine the factors responsible for the use of LC for acute cholecystitis in a stable population. Design: A retrospective survey on 2353 patients with pathologically proven acute cholecystitis treated with cholecystectomy in Hong Kong from 1998 to 2002. Setting: All public hospitals in Hong Kong. Results: The rate of using LC for acute cholecystitis increased by 30.4% from 1998 to 2002. We observed a wide variation in the use of LC for acute cholecystitis ranging from 3.7% to 92.9% (P<.001). There was no correlation between the number of cholecystectomies performed and the percentage of LCs performed in each hospital (P=.39). Logistic regression analysis showed that the hospital, year of operation, and age of the patients were independent variables for LC. Conclusions: A wide variation in the use of LC for acute cholecystitis was observed among the public hospitals in Hong Kong. Young female patients from selected hospitals recently are more likely to be treated with LC. ©2005 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

29144439904	Comparison of early endoscopic ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the management of acute biliary pancreatitis: A prospective randomized study	Background & Aims: The role and potential benefits of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in the management of acute biliary pancreatitis have not been documented. We report a large prospective randomized study comparing early EUS and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the management of these patients. Methods: A prospective randomized study was performed on 140 patients with acute pancreatitis suspected to have a biliary cause. The patients were randomized to have EUS (n = 70) or ERCP (n = 70) within 24 hours from admission. In the EUS group, when EUS detected choledocholithiasis, therapeutic ERCP was performed during the same endoscopy session. In the ERCP group, diagnostic ERCP was performed, followed by therapeutic endoscopy when choledocholithiasis was detected. Results: Examination of the biliary tree by EUS was successful in all patients in the EUS group, whereas cannulation of the common duct during ERCP was unsuccessful in 10 patients (14%) in the ERCP group (P = .001). Combined percutaneous ultrasonography and ERCP missed detection of cholelithiasis in 6 patients in the ERCP group. The overall morbidity rate was 7% in the EUS group, and that in the ERCP group was 14% (P = .172). The hospital stay and mortality rates were comparable in both groups. Conclusions: In selected patients with acute biliary pancreatitis, EUS could safely replace diagnostic ERCP in the management for selecting patients with choledocholithiasis for therapeutic ERCP with a higher successful examination rate, a higher sensitivity in the detection of cholelithiasis, and a comparable morbidity rate. © 2005 by the American Gastroenterological Association.

30944448395	Evaluation of outcome of laparoscopic colorectal resection with POSSUM, Portsmouth POSSUM and colorectal POSSUM	Background: This study evaluated the Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and morbidity (POSSUM), Portsmouth (P) POSSUM and colorectal (CR) POSSUM in laparoscopic colorectal resection. Methods: Observed mortality and morbidity rates in 400 patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection were compared with those predicted by POSSUM, P-POSSUM and CR-POSSUM. Results: Observed mortality and morbidity rates were 0.5 and 19.0 per cent respectively. Mortality rates predicted by POSSUM, P-POSSUM and CR-POSSUM were 10.8, 4.0 and 5.6 per cent respectively, and the morbidity rate predicted by POSSUM was 43.0 per cent. The predicted and observed mortality and morbidity rates showed significant lack of fit. The conversion rate to open surgery was 11.5 percent. The mortality rate for patients having conversion was 2 per cent and was not significantly different to that predicted by P-POSSUM (4 per cent; P = 0.493) or CR-POSSUM (5 per cent; P = 0.370). In this group, the observed and POSSUM-predicted morbidity rates were also similar (43 versus 48 per cent respectively; P = 0.104). Conclusion: POSSUM, P-POSSUM and CR-POSSUM overestimated mortality and morbidity in patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection. However, the mortality rate in patients who required conversion fitted the models of P-POSSUM and CR-POSSUM, and the morbidity rate was comparable to that predicted by POSSUM.

3042658334	Pancreaticoduodenectomy with en bloc portal vein resection for pancreatic carcinoma with suspected portal vein involvement	Pancreaticoduodenectomy combined with portal vein resection is increasingly accepted as a viable treatment option for pancreatic carcinoma with suspected involvement of the portal vein. However, its clinical benefit remains controversial. This study evaluated the outcomes of pancreaticoduodenectomy with portal vein resection for pancreatic carcinoma in a group of Chinese patients operated on by a specialized team in a center with a low case volume of pancreatic cancer. The perioperative and long-term outcomes of 12 patients with portal vein resection for suspected involvement of the portal vein and 38 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy without portal vein resection during the same period were compared. In the former group, eight patients underwent segmental resection, and four patients underwent wedge resection of the portal vein. There were no significant differences in operative blood loss (median 0.8 vs. 0.8 liter, p = 0.313), hospital mortality (0% vs. 2.6%, p = 1.000), or operative morbidity (41.7% vs. 42.1%, p = 0.979) between the two groups. Patients who required portal vein resection had higher frequencies of microscopic lymphatic permeation (58.3% vs. 18.4%,p = 0.023) and vascular invasion (50.0% vs. 15.8%,p = 0.025). Long-term survival was comparable between patients with portal vein resection and those without it (median 19.5 vs. 20.7 months, p = 0.769). These findings suggest that pancreaticoduodenectomy combined with portal vein resection can be performed safely by a specialized team in a center with a low case volume of pancreatic carcinoma and that it may offer survival benefit in patients with suspected portal vein involvement.

3142768515	Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver in association with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor: A case report	Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver is a rare benign lesion that can mimic a malignant liver neoplasm. A case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver found in association with a malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) of the small bowel was reported. The inflammatory pseudotumor was misdiagnosed as a metastasis from the GIST by frozen section. A correct diagnosis was made only after histopathological examination of the paraffin section of the resected specimen. This case is particularly interesting because of the association of the two rare pathological entities and the diagnostic dilemma that arose 6from the similarity of their histological appearances. To our knowledge, this association has not been reported in the literature. Copyright © 2004 by The WJG Press.

33645102297	Safety limit of large-volume hepatic radiofrequency ablation in a rat model	Background: Large-volume hepatic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been used to treat large liver tumors, but its safety limit is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the possible systemic responses of large-volume hepatic RFA and to estimate its safety limit in normal and cirrhotic rats. Hypothesis: Large-volume hepatic RFA causes a significant systemic inflammatory reaction. Design: Experimental study. Setting: University teaching hospital. Intervention: Using the Cool-tip RF System (Radionics, Burlington, Mass), RFA was performed for different percentages of the liver volume by weight in normal and cirrhotic Sprague-Dawley rats. Main Outcome Measures: Changes in concentrations of serum inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor α [TNF-α] and interleukin [IL] 6), functions of various end organs, and survival rates were assessed. Results: In the normal liver groups, the concentrations of TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly elevated in the early postoperative period when 50% (mean ± SD TNF-α concentration, 130.3 ± 15.6 pg/mL; mean ± SD IL-6 concentration, 163.2 ± 12.2 pg/mL) and 60% (mean ± SD TNF-α concentration, 145.7 ± 13.0 pg/mL; mean ± SD IL-6 concentration, 180.8 ± 11.0 pg/mL) of the liver volume were ablated compared with the control group (mean ± SD TNF-α concentration, 30.4 ± 9.9 pg/mL, P < .001; mean ± SD IL-6 concentration, 28.4 ± 6.7 pg/mL, P < .001). The concentrations of TNF-α and IL-6 in other groups remained similar to those in the control group. Thrombocytopenia, prolonged clotting time, and interstitial pneumonitis occurred when 50% and 60% of the liver volume were ablated. The 4-week survival rates were 100%, 60%, and 0% when 40%, 50%, and 60%, respectively, of the liver volume were ablated. Similar systemic inflammatory responses and poor survival rates were observed among the cirrhotic liver groups when 30% and 40% of the liver volume were ablated. Conclusions: The normal rats can tolerate RFA of 40% of the liver volume with minimal morbidity and no mortality whereas the cirrhotic rats can only tolerate 20% of the ablated liver volume. Beyond that limit, RFA would cause significant systemic inflammatory responses and poor survival. ©2006 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

33645666611	Efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation for perivascular hepatocellular carcinoma without hepatic inflow occlusion	Background: The role of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for perivascular (up to 5 mm from the major intrahepatic portal vein or hepatic vein branches) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear because of possible incomplete tumour ablation and potential vascular damage. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RFA for perivascular HCC without hepatic inflow occlusion. Methods: Between May 2001 and November 2003, RFA using an internally cooled electrode was performed on 52 patients with perivascular HCC (group 1) through open (n = 39), percutaneous (n = 9), laparoscopic (n = 2) and thoracoscopic (n = 2) approaches. Hepatic inflow occlusion was not applied during the ablation procedure. The perioperative and postoperative outcomes were compared with those of 90 patients with non-perivascular HCC (group 2) treated by RFA during the same period. Results: The morbidity rate was similar between groups 1 and 2 (25 versus 28 per cent; P = 0.844). One patient in group 1 (2 per cent) and two in group 2 (2 per cent) had developed thrombosis of major intrahepatic blood vessels on follow-up computed tomography scan. There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 in mortality rate (2 versus 0 per cent; P = 0.366), complete ablation rate for small HCC (92 versus 98 per cent; P = 0.197), local recurrence rate (11 versus 9 per cent; P = 0.762) and overall survival (1-year: 86 versus 87 per cent; 2-year: 75 versus 75 per cent; P = 0.741). Conclusion: RFA without hepatic inflow occlusion is a safe and effective treatment for perivascular HCC. Copyright © 2006 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

33845434247	Improved operative and survival outcomes of surgical treatment for hilar cholangiocarcinoma	Background: The aim of the present study was to assess whether an aggressive surgical approach in the management of patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma was associated with improved operative and survival outcomes. Methods: Eighty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma treated between 1989 and 1998 (period 1), and 60 patients treated between 1999 and 2004 (period 2), were evaluated. Modifications to management in period 2 primarily included percutaneous biliary drainage instead of endoscopic drainage for relief of obstructive jaundice, preoperative right portal vein embolization before right-sided hepatectomy, routine total caudate lobectomy and radical lymphadenectomy during surgical resection of the tumour. Results: The surgical resection rate was significantly higher in period 2 than in period 1 (45 versus 16 per cent; P < 0.001). All patients in period 2 underwent major hepatectomy with concomitant caudate lobectomy. The operative morbidity and hospital mortality rates decreased significantly in period 2 compared with period 1, with significantly better survival outcomes. In multivariate analysis, resection of the tumour in period 2 and operative blood loss of 1.5 litres or less were the significant independent factors associated with improved survival. Conclusion: An aggressive surgical approach was associated with improved operative and survival outcomes for patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.

33845223202	Radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic liver tumors: A comparative study	Background: This study compared the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver metastases. Methods: We compared the outcomes of 240 patients with HCC and 44 patients with liver metastases treated with RFA. Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Effects of different variables on recurrences were studied. Results: A total of 406 tumor nodules were treated. The median size of the largest ablated tumor was 2.5 cm, and the median tumor number was 1. Complete tumor ablation was achieved in 91.2%. Local recurrence rate was 15.4% after a median follow-up of 24.5 months. There was no significant impact of tumor pathology on local recurrence. However, patients with liver metastasis had higher extrahepatic recurrence rate (P = 0.019) and shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.007). Patients with multiple tumors had higher local (P = 0.047) and extrahepatic (P = 0.019) recurrence rates than those with a solitary tumor. Tumor size had an impact on local recurrence rate only in patients with liver metastasis with a higher rate in those with tumor >2.5 cm in diameter (P = 0.028). Conclusions: Tumor pathology does not appear to have a significant impact on local recurrence rates. RFA is effective in local tumor control for both HCC and liver metastasis. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

34249316548	A randomized, controlled trial of postoperative adjuvant interferon therapy after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma	OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of adjuvant interferon therapy in patients with predominantly hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to investigate whether the prognosis after hepatic resection could be improved. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Recurrence is common after hepatic resection for HCC. Interferon possesses antiviral, immunomodulatory, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic effects and may be an effective form of adjuvant therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since February 1999, patients with no residual disease after hepatic resection for HCC were randomly assigned with stratification by pTNM stage to receive no treatment (control group), interferon alpha-2b 10 MIU/m (IFN-I group) or 30 MIU/m (IFN-II group) thrice weekly for 16 weeks. Enrollment to the IFN-II group was terminated from January 2000 because adverse effects resulted in treatment discontinuation in the first 6 patients. By June 2002, 40 patients each had been enrolled into the control group and IFN-I group. The baseline clinical, laboratory, and tumor characteristics of both groups were comparable. RESULTS: The 1- and 5-year survival rates were 85% and 61%, respectively, for the control group and 97% and 79%, respectively, for the IFN-I group (P = 0.137). After adjusting for the confounding prognostic factors in a Cox model, the relative risk of death for interferon treatment was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.17-1.05; P = 0.063). Exploratory subset analysis showed that adjuvant interferon had no survival benefit for pTNM stage I/II tumor (5-year survival 90% in both groups; P = 0.917) but prevented early recurrence and improved the 5-year survival of patients with stage III/IVA tumor from 24% to 68% (P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: In a group of patients with predominantly hepatitis B-related HCC, adjuvant interferon therapy showed a trend for survival benefit, primarily in those with pTNM stage III/IVA tumors. Further larger randomized trials stratified for stage are needed. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

34347264809	Adrenalectomy in Hong Kong: a critical review of adoption of laparoscopic approach	Background: A population-based study on adrenal surgery for treatment of adrenal diseases is still lacking. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the practice and the adoption of laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) in a stable population, as well as the potential impact of case volume on outcomes. Methods: Patients undergoing elective adrenalectomy (n = 486) from 15 Hong Kong public hospitals over a 6-year period were reviewed. Patients undergoing LA (n = 353) were compared to those undergoing open adrenalectomy (n = 133). Results: The overall number of adrenalectomies and the number and proportion of laparoscopic approach increased progressively during this period. The median operating time was similar but the median blood loss (50 mL vs 300 mL, P < .01) was less and the mean hospital stay (4.4 days vs 9.4 days) was shorter for LA. Smaller lesions tended to be selected for LA. There was no correlation between postoperative outcome with respect to length of stay and case volume for LA. Conclusions: The adoption of LA in Hong Kong hospitals was propagating progressively. Patients selected for LA had improved outcome although there seemed to be no significant correlation between postoperative outcome and case volume. © 2007 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights reserved.

0032790193	Major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with an unsatisfactory indocyanine green clearance test	Background: Liver failure is the commonest cause of postoperative death in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). With the improvement in operative technique and perioperative care, the limit of hepatic functional reserve may be lowered. The aim of this study was to evaluate the postoperative morbidity, mortality and survival rates in patients with an indocyanine green (ICG) retention value higher than 14 per cent, after major hepatectomy for HCC. Methods: From January 1994 to December 1997, 117 patients underwent major hepatectomy for HCC; 92 patients had preoperative ICG retention at 15 min lower than 14 per cent (median 8.3 (range 1.6-13.8) per cent), while 25 patients had ICG retention greater than 14 per cent (17.4 (range 14.3-35.3) per cent). Data were collected prospectively and analysed retrospectively. Results: The two groups of patients were similar in terms of age, sex ratio, preoperative platelet count, liver biochemistry, Child-Pugh status and operative procedures performed, but the prothrombin time was significantly longer in the high ICG group. The operative blood loss (1.5 litres), the amount of blood transfused and the number of patients requiring blood transfusion were similar. The postoperative complication rate (41 versus 40 per cent), duration of hospital stay (12 versus 13 days), hospital mortality rate (1 versus 4 per cent) and median survival time (47 versus 45 months) were not significantly different. Conclusion: With meticulous surgical technique to decrease intraoperative blood loss and good perioperative care, selected patients with limited hepatic functional reserve can achieve a good immediate postoperative result and a survival rate similar to that of patients with good hepatic functional reserve.

0033510691	Hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma: Toward zero hospital deaths	Objective: The authors report on the surgical techniques and protocol for perioperative care that have yielded a zero hospital mortality rate in 110 consecutive patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The hepatectomy results are analyzed with the aim of further reducing the postoperative morbidity rate. Summary Background Data: In recent years, hepatectomy has been performed with a mortality rate of <10% in patients with HCC, but a zero hospital mortality rate in a large patient series has never been reported. At Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, the surgical techniques and perioperative management in hepatectomy for HCC have evolved yearly into a final standardized protocol that reduced the hospital mortality rate from 28% in 1989 to 0% in 1996 and 1997. Methods: Surgical techniques were designed to reduce intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion, and ischemic injury to the liver remnant in hepatectomy. Postoperative care was focused on preservation and promotion of liver function by providing adequate tissue oxygenation and immediate postoperative nutritional support that consisted of branched-chain amino acid-enriched solution, low-dose dextrose, medium-chain triglycerides, and phosphate. The pre-, intra-, and postoperative data were collected prospectively and analyzed each year to assess the influence of the evolving surgical techniques and perioperative care on outcome. Results: Of 330 patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC, underlying cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis were present in 161 (49%) and 108 (33%) patients, respectively. There were no significant changes in the patient characteristics throughout the 9-year period, but there were significant reductions in intraoperative blood loss and blood transfusion requirements. From 1994 to 1997, the median blood transfusion requirement was 0 ml, and 64% of the patients did not require a blood transfusion. The postoperative morbidity rate remained the same throughout the study period. Complications in the patients operated on during 1996 and 1997 were primarily wound infections; the potentially fatal complications seen in the early years, such as subphrenic sepsis, biliary leakage, and hepatic coma, were absent. By univariate analysis, the volume of blood loss, volume of blood transfusions, and operation time were correlated positively with postoperative morbidity rates in 1996 and 1997. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that the operation time was the only parameter that correlated significantly with the postoperative morbidity rate. Conclusion: With appropriate surgical techniques and perioperative management to preserve function of the liver remnant, hepatectomy for HCC can be performed without hospital deaths. To improve surgical outcome further, strategies to reduce the operation time are being investigated.

0032862864	Carcinoma of the colon with synchronous hepatic metastasis in a cirrhotic liver harboring a hepatocellular carcinoma	Tumor metastasis to a cirrhotic liver is rare. It has been suggested that colorectal cancer does not metastasize to the cirrhotic liver. We reported a 65 year-old man, a known carrier of hepatitis B surface antigen, diagnosed to have hepatocellular carcinoma with routine screening. A partial hepatectomy with resection of segments VI and VII was performed. The hepatectomy specimen revealed a 4.5 cm diameter HCC in a cirrhotic liver. Incidentally, 0.8 cm diameter ulcer at the descending colon. Histological examination of the left hemicolectomy specimen showed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.

0033648462	Determining resectability for hepatocellular carcinoma: The role of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography	We reviewed our experience with preoperative determination of resectability in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over the last 10 years, and evaluated the role of laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasonography (USG) since we instituted this technique in June 1994. From January 1989 to December 1998, 500 of 1741 patients with HCC (28.7%) were considered suitable for hepatic resection after preoperative assessment. Significantly more contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans and fewer percutaneous USGs or hepatic arteriograms were performed in the 299 patients managed since June 1994 (group 2) than in the 201 patients managed before then (group 1). One hundred and ninety-eight patients in group 2 (66%) underwent laparoscopy with laparoscopic USG. Unresectable disease was found in 41 patients in group 1 (20.4%) (all at laparotomy), and in 68 patients in group 2 (22.7%) (16 at laparotomy without laparoscopic examination, 31 at laparoscopic examination alone, and 21 at laparotomy after an inconclusive laparoscopic examination) (P = 0.5). The most common features of unresectable disease were the presence of bilobar intrahepatic metastases and an inadequate liver remnant with cirrhosis. The adoption of the laparoscopic examination after June 1994 improved the overall resection rate at laparotomy in group 2 from 77.3% to 86.2%, which was better than that in group 1 (79.6%, P = 0.057). For patients with unresectable disease, the operation time and hospital stay were significantly shorter in group 2. The postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 9.8% and 4.9%, respectively, in group 1, and 5.9% and 2.9% in group 2. There was no operative morbidity in the 31 patients who had unresectable disease detected by the laparoscopic examination alone. Laparoscopy with laparoscopic USG avoids unnecessary laparotomy, and has a definite role in determining resectability in patients with HCC.

0034941503	Improving survival results after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma: A prospective study of 377 patients over 10 years	Objective: To investigate whether the survival results after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have improved within the past decade by an analysis of a prospective cohort of patients over a 10-year period. Summary Background Data: The surgical death rate after resection of HCC has greatly improved in recent years, but the long-term prognosis remains unsatisfactory. It remains unknown whether the survival results after resection of HCC have improved within the past decade. Methods: The clinicopathologic and follow-up data of 377 patients who underwent curative resection of HCC between January 1989 and January 1999 were prospectively collected. These patients were categorized according to two time periods: before 1994 (group 1, n = 136) and after 1994 (group 2, n = 241). The two groups were compared for clinicopathologic data and survival results. The prognostic factors for disease-free survival were further analyzed to identify the factors that might have led to improved survival outcomes. Results: The overall and disease-free survival results were significantly better in group 2 compared with group 1. Patients in group 2 had significantly higher proportions of subclinical presentation, small tumors, and tumors of early pTNM stage. There were also significantly lower frequencies of histologic margin involvement, less intraoperative blood loss, and a lower transfusion rate in group 2. By multivariate analysis, early pTNM stage, subclinical HCC, and no perioperative transfusion were independent favorable prognostic factors for disease-free survival. Conclusions: Significant improvement of overall and disease-free survival results after resection of HCC has been achieved within the past decade as a result of advances in the diagnosis and surgical management of HCC. Earlier diagnosis of HCC by better imaging modalities, increased detection of subclinical HCC by screening of high-risk patients, and a reduced perioperative transfusion rate were identified as the major contributory factors for the improved outcomes.

4444253523	Management of hepatocellular carcinoma in renal transplant recipients	Background and Objective: In Hong Kong where hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 20% of all malignant transformations in renal transplant recipients. The aim of the present study was to review the management and outcome of HCC in renal transplant recipients at a specialized surgical center. Method: A retrospective analysis on the data collected prospectively in a tertiary referral center. Results: From January 1991 to December 2002, five renal transplant recipients were diagnosed to have primary HCC and received treatment in our center. There were four men and one woman with a median age of 47 (range, 38-68) years. Four of them had cadaveric renal transplantation whereas one had live donor transplantation. All of them were HBV carriers. The median tumor size was 3.5 cm (range, 1.8-8 cm). All tumors, except one, were diagnosed in sub-clinical stage by surveillance serum α-fetoprotein assay and percutaneous ultrasonography. Four patients were treated with surgical resection and one received transarterial oily chemoembolization (TOCE) as their primary treatments. There was one peri-operative death and the remaining three surgically treated patients were alive 4, 62, and 64 months after the resection. One patient developed recurrence 18 months after curative resection and was treated with TOCE. The patient with unresectable disease was alive for 50 months after the initial diagnosis. The surgical resection and overall survival rates of these patients were better than the published results. Conclusion: Early detection with regular serum α-fetoprotein assay and ultrasonographic study, vigilant care in the peri-operative period, long-term follow-up for detection and treatment of recurrence, as well as close collaboration between renal physicians and liver surgeons may improve the outcome of treatment of HCC in renal transplant recipients. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

4644258425	Improving perioperative outcome expands the role of hepatectomy in management of benign and malignant hepatobiliary diseases: Analysis of 1222 consecutive patients from a prospective database	Objective: To assess the trends in perioperative outcome of hepatectomy for hepatobiliary diseases. Methods: Data of 1222 consecutive patients who underwent hepatectomy for hepatobiliary diseases from July 1989 to June 2003 in a tertiary institution were collected prospectively. Perioperative outcome of patients in the first (group I) and second (group II) halves of this period was compared. Factors associated with morbidity and mortality were analyzed. Results: Diagnoses included hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 734), other liver cancers (n = 257), extrahepatic biliary malignancies (n = 43), hepatolithiasis (n = 101), benign liver tumors (n = 61), and other diseases (n = 26). The majority of patients (61.8%) underwent major hepatectomy of ≥3 segments. The overall hospital mortality and morbidity were 4.9% and 32.4%, respectively. The number of hepatectomies increased from 402 in group I to 820 in group II, partly as a result of more liberal patient selection. Group II had more elderly patients (P = 0.006), more patients with comorbid illnesses (P = 0.001), and significantly worse liver function. Nonetheless, group II had lower blood loss (median 750 versus 1450 mL, P < 0.001), perioperative transfusion (17.3% versus 67.7%, P < 0.001), morbidity (30.0% versus 37.3%, P = 0.012), and hospital mortality (3.7% versus 7.5%, P = 0.004). On multivariate analysis, hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated serum creatinine, major hepatic resection, and transfusion were the significant predictors of hospital mortality, whereas concomitant extrahepatic procedure, thrombocytopenia, and transfusion were the predictors of morbidity. Conclusions: Perioperative outcome has improved despite extending the indication of hepatectomy to more high-risk patients. The role of hepatectomy in the management of hepatobiliary diseases can be expanded. Reduced perioperative transfusion is the main contributory factor for improved outcome.

49749148040	Population-based information on emergency colorectal surgery and evaluation on effect of operative volume on mortality	Introduction: Population-based information on emergency surgery for colorectal conditions was limited. The present study was designed to review comprehensively the outcomes of emergency colectomy in Hong Kong population and evaluate the effect of case load on mortality after considering case mixes. Methods: All adult patients older than aged 18 years who underwent emergency colectomy in 2003 in all 15 Hong Kong public hospitals were included. Demographics and perioperative variables were reviewed and analyzed. Hospitals were classified into low, middle, or high operative volume groups according to their yearly caseloads, and their performance in terms of mortality were compared by using CR-POSSUM. Results: A total of 864 patients with a mean age of 67.8 years were included. Bowel obstruction and peritonitis were the two major clinical indications for the surgery. The crude in-hospital mortality rate was 18.9%; individual hospitals varied from 8.7% to 33.3%. With the risk adjusted model, all hospital groups performed within 95% confidence limits of prediction. There was no statistical difference for mortality of hospitals of different case volume. Conclusion: A crude in-hospital mortality of 18.9% after emergency colorectal surgery was observed in Hong Kong public hospitals. Higher hospital case load is not significantly associated with better outcomes in emergency colectomy. © 2008 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.

0035018890	Soluble E-cadherin is a valid prognostic marker in gastric carcinoma	Background - Gastric cancer remains a major cause of cancer mortality globally but no good prognostic tumour marker is available. Soluble fragment of E-cadherin protein has been reported to increase in the sera of patients with cancer and recently was found to be elevated in 67% of patients with gastric cancer. Aims - To investigate if serum soluble E-cadherin is a valid prognostic marker in gastric cancer. Methods - Concentrations of soluble E-cadherin from 116 patients with histologically confirmed gastric adenocarinoma and 40 healthy subjects were measured using an immunoenzymometric method with a commercially available sandwich ELISA kit based on monoclonal antibodies. Results - The logarithm of the means of soluble E-cadherin concentration was significantly higher in patients with gastric cancers (mean 3.85 (SD 0.28)) than in healthy subjects (3.71 (0.18)) (p=0.001), and in palliative/conservatively treated cancers (3.91 (0.35)) than in operable cancers (3.78 (0.19)) (p=0.015). The logarithm of the concentrations correlated with tumour size (p=0.032) and carcinoembryonic antigen concentrations (p=0.001). The cut off value calculated from discriminant analysis on operability and inoperability/palliative treatment was 7025 ng/ml. Soluble E-cadherin concentrations higher than this cut off value predicted tumour (T4) depth invasion (p=0.020, confidence interval (CI) 1.008-1.668) and palliative/conservative treatment (p=0.023, CI 1.038-2.514). In contrast, the relative risks for lymph node (N2) metastasis, distant metastasis, and stage III/IV disease were 1.41, 1.33, and 1.55 respectively, despite not reaching statistical significance. Conclusion - Serum soluble E-cadherin is a potential valid prognostic marker for gastric cancer. A high concentration predicts palliative/conservative treatment and T4 invasion.

0034785224	Biliary complications during liver resection	Biliary complications after hepatectomy may lead to sepsis, liver failure, and death. Measures to detect biliary injury after liver transection may reduce such morbidity. The aim of this study was to investigate the trend of biliary complications after hepatectomy during the last 10 years and assess the efficacy of intraoperative measures (methylene blue test, cholangiography, fibrin glue application) for reducing postoperative biliary complications. This is a retrospective study of 616 consecutive patients who underwent hepatectomy in our institution from January 1989 to September 1998. The study period was divided into the first 5 years and the second 5 years for comparison. The hospital mortality rate was 6%. It was significantly reduced during the second 5-year period (3.3% vs. 10.6%; p = 0.0002). The postoperative biliary leakage rate was 5.5% and was also reduced during the second 5-year period (3.5% vs. 9.8%; p = 0.004). Postresection methylene blue tests were performed more frequently during the second 5-year period than the first (63% vs. 28%; p = 0.0001). The postoperative biliary leakage rate was reduced by the methylene blue test (3.6% vs. 7.3%; p < 0.05) but not by application of fibrin glue (7.2% vs. 4.2%) or postresection cholangiography. However, among the 60 patients with a positive methylene blue test, postoperative biliary leakage still occurred in 10% of them after the leakage sites were sutured. In conclusion, the biliary complication rate is decreasing. Only the postresection methylene blue test, but not postresection cholangiography or application of fibrin glue, helps to reduce the postoperative biliary leakage rate.

0035154349	Management of gallstone cholangitis in the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy	Hypothesis: The combined endoscopic and laparoscopic approach is safe and effective in managing gallstone cholangitis in the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Design: Retrospective case series. Setting: University teaching hospital. Patients: One hundred eighty-four consecutive patients with gallstone cholangitis treated between January 1995 and December 1998. Interventions: The main treatments were endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) followed by interval LC. Open or laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (OCBDE or LCBDE) was used when ERCP or ES failed. Main Outcome Measures: Success of various interventions, morbidity and mortality, and long-term incidence of recurrent biliary symptoms. Results: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was successful in 175 patients (95%), with bile duct stones found in 147 (84%). Endoscopic stone clearance by ES was achieved in 132 patients (90%). Morbidity rate after ERCP or ES was 4.0% (n=7), and overall mortality rate from cholangitis was 1.6% (n=3). After bile duct stone clearance, 82 patients underwent LC with a conversion rate of 9.8% (n=8) and a morbidity rate of 3.6% (n=3). Eighteen patients underwent OCBDE with a morbidity rate of 33% (n=6), and 3 underwent LCBDE with 1 conversion and no morbidity. There was no operative mortality. Seventy-eight patients were managed conservatively after endoscopic clearance of bile duct stones. Follow-up data were available in 101 patients with cholecystectomy and 73 patients with gallbladder in situ. During a median follow-up of 24 months, recurrent biliary symptoms occurred in 5.9% (n=6) and 25% (n=18), respectively (P=.001). In both groups, the most common recurrent symptom was cholangitis (n=5 and n=14, respectively). Gallbladder in situ (risk ratio, 4.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-12.50; P=.01) and small-size papillotomy (risk ratio, 2.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-8.10; P=.04) were significant risk factors for recurrent biliary symptoms. Conclusions: Endoscopic sphincterotomy for biliary drainage and stone removal, followed by interval LC, is a safe and effective approach for managing gallstone cholangitis. Patients with gallbladder left in situ after ES have an increased risk of recurrent biliary symptoms. Laparoscopic cholescystectomy should be recommended after endoscopic management of cholangitis except in patients with prohibitive surgical risk.

0035449931	Management of spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma: Single-center experience	Purpose: To report the management of patients with spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a single center over a 10-year period and to evaluate a two-stage therapeutic approach. Patients and Methods: A retrospective study was performed on all 1,716 patients with HCC who presented from 1989 to 1998. The two-stage therapeutic approach to manage ruptured HCC consisted of initial management by conservative method, hemostasis by transarterial embolization (TAE) or surgical means, followed by second-stage hepatic resection or transarterial oily chemoembolization (TOCE). Results of definitive treatment were compared with patients with no history of rupture during the same study period. Results: During the study period, 154 patients (9%) had spontaneous HCC rupture. Initial intervention to control bleeding included TAE in 42 patients, surgical hemostasis in 35 patients, and conservative management only in 53 patients. The 30-day mortality rate was 38%. Independent factors on presentation affecting 30-day mortality were shock on admission, hemoglobin, serum total bilirubin, and known diagnosis of inoperable tumor. After initial stabilization and clinical evaluation, 33 patients underwent hepatic resection and 30 patients received TOCE. Median survival of the hepatectomy patients was 25.7 months; that of the TOCE patients was 9.7 months. Compared with patients with no rupture, survival after hepatectomy (25.7 months v 49.2 months, P = .003) was inferior but still substantially long, whereas survival after TOCE was comparable (9.7 months v 8.7 months, P = .904). Conclusion: Early mortality of spontaneous rupture of HCC was dependent on prerupture disease state, liver function, and severity of bleeding. Although it was a catastrophic presentation, prolonged survival could be achieved in selected patients with second-stage hepatic resection or TOCE. © 2001 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

0035458873	Detection of choledocholithiasis by EUS in acute pancreatitis: A prospective evaluation in 100 consecutive patients	Background: ERCP is the standard for detection of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis, and, if performed early, ERCP decreases morbidity. However, there are procedure-related complications. The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the ability of EUS to detect choledocholithiasis in patients presenting with acute pancreatitis. Methods: The study group comprised 100 consecutive patients who presented with acute pancreatitis. EUS, and immediately thereafter, ERCP were performed by separate blinded examiners within 24 hours of admission. The diagnostic accuracy of EUS in identifying gallbladder stones was compared with that of transcutaneous US. The diagnostic accuracy of EUS in detecting choledocholithiasis was then compared with that of US and ERCP based on the results of endoscopic instrumentation of the bile duct after sphincterotomy. Results: EUS was more sensitive than US in detecting gallbladder stones (100% vs. 84%, p < 0.005). The sensitivities of ERCP and EUS for choledocholithiasis were both 97%, and the overall accuracies were 96% and 98%, respectively, with no significant difference. EUS detected the absence of choledocholithiasis in 65 of 66 patients (specificity = 98%). Endosonographic examination was successful in all patients, whereas ERCP was unsuccessful in 5 patients (p > 0.05). Post-endoscopic sphincterotomy bleeding developed in 4 patients; there was no EUS-related morbidity (p > 0.05). Conclusion: EUS is more sensitive than US in detecting biliary stones in patients with acute pancreatitis. It is as accurate as ERCP in detecting choledocholithiasis. EUS can be used to select patients with acute pancreatitis who require therapeutic ERCP, thus avoiding diagnostic ERCP and its associated potential for complications in the majority of patients.

0036080592	Choledochal cysts in adults	Hypothesis: Choledochal cyst is rarely diagnosed in adulthood. When complicated by biliary tract malignancy, the disease has a distinct presentation and carries a dismal prognosis despite radical surgical resection. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: A retrospective study was performed on 30 adult patients who presented with choledochal cyst from January 1, 1989, to December 31, 2000. Main Outcome Measures: The clinical presentation, management, and outcome of patients with and without biliary tract malignancy. Results: Nine patients (30%) had biliary tract malignancy complicating choledochal cyst (group A). Compared with 21 patients without malignancy (group B), group A patients had a significantly higher incidence of previous internal drainage operations for choledochal cyst (P =.049) and presentation with cholangitis (P =.03). Four patients in group A underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and 3 received a palliative biliary drainage operation. The overall median survival of patients in group A was 12 months. Complete excision of choledochal cyst and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy were performed for all patients in group B, among whom 2 underwent concomitant hemihepatectomy. The operative morbidity and mortality were 14% and 0%, respectively, and there were no long-term complications with a median follow-up of 66 months. Conclusions: Biliary tract malignancy complicating choledochal cyst in adults should be suspected in patients with a history of internal drainage of choledochal cyst and presentation with cholangitis. Complete excision of choledochal cyst with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is the treatment of choice for patients without malignancy and can be performed with low operative morbidity and absence of long-term complications in adult patients.

0036237822	Randomized controlled trial of transarterial Lipiodol chemoembolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma	This randomized, controlled trial assessed the efficacy of transarterial Lipiodol (Lipiodol Ultrafluide, Laboratoire Guerbet, Aulnay-Sous-Bois, France) chemoembolization in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. From March 1996 to October 1997, 80 out of 279 Asian patients with newly diagnosed unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma fulfilled the entry criteria and randomly were assigned to treatment with chemoembolization using a variable dose of an emulsion of cisplatin in Lipiodol and gelatin-sponge particles injected through the hepatic artery (chemoembolization group, 40 patients) or symptomatic treatment (control group, 40 patients). One patient assigned to the control group secondarily was excluded because of unrecognized systemic metastasis. Chemoembolization was repeated every 2 to 3 months unless there was evidence of contraindications or progressive disease. Survival was the main end point. The chemoembolization group received a total of 192 courses of chemoembolization with a median of 4.5 (range, 1-15) courses per patient. Chemoembolization resulted in a marked tumor response, and the actuarial survival was significantly better in the chemoembolization group (1 year, 57%; 2 years, 31%; 3 years, 26%) than in the control group (1 year, 32%; 2 years, 11%; 3 years, 3%; P = .002). When adjustments for baseline variables that were prognostic on univariate analysis were made with a multivariate Cox model, the survival benefit of chemoembolization remained significant (relative risk of death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29-0.81; P = .006). Although death from liver failure was more frequent in patients who received chemoembolization, the liver functions of the survivors were not significantly different. In conclusion, in Asian patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, transarterial Lipiodol chemoembolization significantly improves survival and is an effective form of treatment.

79959670851	Needle implantation cryoprobes: Biophysical and thermal characteristics	There has been increased recent interest in hepatic cryosurgery for primary and metastatic tumors in the liver. This has been realized through technological advances in intraoperative ultrasound monitoring and cryoprobe technology. Purpose-designed needle implantable cryoprobes have been developed to freeze deep-seated tumors in the hepatic parenchyma. However, the biophysical and thermal characteristics of these implantable cryoprobes have not been studied. This article discusses the biophysical and thermal characteristics of recently developed high-efficiency, implantable needle cryoprobes that can be used laparoscopically. The cryolesion was formed along the whole length of the cryoprobe implanted into hepatic tissue. It was cylindrical in shape and extended 8 mm beyond the tip of the cryoprobe after 20 minutes of freezing. During this period of freezing, the volume of the cryolesion increased in a near constant manner, but the diameter increased in a logarithmic fashion. In addition, single-cycle freezing produced a larger cryolesion than a dual freeze cycle interrupted by a 5-minute thaw. Further, increasing the length of cryoprobe implantation increased the volume of the cryolesion, although the diameter was smaller. The rate of cooling at the tip of the cryoprobe was also faster with partial implantation of the cryoprobe than with complete implantation. The cooling rate varied vertically along the length of the cryoprobe, as well as horizontally from the cryoprobe. © 1997 by W. B. Saunders Company.

79960780934	Outcome after partial hepatectomy for hepatocellular cancer within the Milan criteria	Background: There is a trend to offer liver transplantation to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with tumour status within the Milan criteria but with preserved liver function. This study aimed to evaluate the outcome of such patients following partial hepatectomy as primary treatment. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on all adult patients with HCC and tumour status within the Milan criteria undergoing partial hepatectomy at a single centre from 1995 to 2008. Their outcomes were compared with those of similar patients having right-lobe living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) as primary treatment. Results: A total of 408 patients with HCC were enrolled. Some 384 patients with a solitary tumour 5 cm or less in diameter had a better 5-year survival rate than 24 patients with oligonodular tumours (2-3 nodules, each 3 cm or less in size) (70·7 versus 46 per cent; P = 0·025). Multivariable analysis identified younger age (65 years or less), lack of postoperative complications, negative resection margin, absent microvascular invasion and non-cirrhotic liver as predictors of favourable overall survival. The 5-year survival rate of 287 younger patients with chronic liver disease and R0 hepatectomy was 72·8 per cent, comparable to that of 81 per cent in 50 similar patients treated by LDLT (P = 0·093). Conclusion: Partial hepatectomy for patients with HCC and tumour status within the Milan criteria achieved a satisfactory 5-year survival rate, particularly in younger patients with solitary tumours and R0 hepatectomy. Patients with oligonodular tumours have a worse survival and might benefit from liver transplantation. © 2011 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Published by John Wiley and Sons Ltd.

0037225696	Hepatic resection for combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma	Hypothesis: Combined hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is an uncommon form of primary liver cancer with features of hepatocellular and biliary epithelial differentiation. The clinical significance of this disease entity is poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to determine the operative and survival outcomes of patients with HCC-CC who underwent hepatic resection. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: The study comprised 12 patients (aged 28-72 years) with HCC-CC (HCC-CC group) who underwent hepatic resection between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 2000. The diagnosis was based on a combination of histological, immunohistochemical, and, if necessary, electron microscopic examinations of the resected specimen. Main Outcome Measures: Clinicopathological data and operative and survival outcomes of the HCC-CC group were compared with those of 476 patients with HCC (HCC group) and 25 patients with intrahepatic CC (CC group) who underwent hepatic resection during the study period. Results: Ten patients (83%) in the HCC-CC group underwent major hepatic resection. The operative morbidity and mortality were 17% (2 of 12 patients) and 0%, respectively. The clinicopathological variables of the HCC-CC group resembled those of the HCC group more closely than those of the CC group. The incidence of positive hepatitis B serologic test results in the HCC-CC group (7 [58%] of 12 patients) was intermediate between that of the HCC group (392 [82%] of 476 patients) and that of the CC group (5 [20%] of 25 patients) (P<.001). Underlying chronic liver disease was significantly less common in the CC group (5 [20%] of 25 patients) than in either the HCC-CC group (9 [75%] of 12 patients) or the HCC group (421 [88%] of 476 patients) (P<.001). After hepatic resection, the median disease-free survival of the HCC-CC, HCC, and CC groups was 10, 18, and 24 months, respectively (P=.44). The overall median survival was shortest in the HCC-CC group (17 months) and was not significantly different from that of the CC group (26 months) (P=.38), but was significantly worse than that of the HCC group (52 months) (P=.02). Conclusions: Although the clinicopathological variables of patients with HCC-CC were most similar to those of patients with HCC, patients with HCC-CC had a significantly worse survival outcome after hepatic resection when compared with patients with HCC. Further studies on postoperative adjuvant therapy and multimodality treatment for recurrent disease are required to prolong the survival of these patients.

0036829825	Extended hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis: Is it justified?	Objective: To evaluate the perioperative outcomes and long-term survival of extended hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis. Summary Background Data: Hepatic resection is a well-established treatment for HCC in cirrhotic patients with preserved liver function and limited disease. However, the role of extended hepatic resection (more than four segments) for HCC in cirrhotic patients has not been elucidated. Methods: Between 1993 and 2000, 45 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed cirrhosis underwent right or left extended hepatectomy for HCC (group A). Perioperative outcomes and long-term survival of these patients were compared with 161 patients with HCC and cirrhosis who underwent hepatic resection of a lesser extent in the same period (group B). All clinicopathologic and follow-up data were collected prospectively. Results: Group A patients had significantly higher intraoperative blood loss, longer operation time, and longer hospital stay than group B. However, the two groups were similar in overall morbidity and hospital mortality. There were no significant differences in the incidence of liver failure or other complications. The resection margin width was similar between the two groups. Despite significantly larger tumor size in group A compared with group B, long-term survival was comparable between the two groups. Conclusions: Extended hepatic resection for HCC can be performed in selected cirrhotic patients with acceptable morbidity, mortality, and long-term survival that are comparable to those of lesser hepatic resection. Extended hepatectomy for large HCC extending from one lobe to the other or central HCC critically related to the hepatic veins is justifiable in cirrhotic patients with preserved liver function and adequate liver remnant.

0037334691	Value of live donor liver transplantation experience in major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma	Background: Live donor liver transplantation (LDLT) mandates conversance in liver anatomy and major hepatectomy. Hepatocellular carcinoma is most reliably treated by hepatectomy. Hypothesis: The outcomes of major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma are influenced by the surgeon's LDLT experience. Design: We collected prospective cohort study data on patient and disease characteristics. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: A retrospective study was performed on 250 patients who underwent major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma from January 16, 1996, through December 28, 2001. Main Outcome Measures: Overall and disease-free survival and outcomes including blood loss, blood transfusion, and complications. Results: The 3 liver transplantation surgeons (LTSs) performed 102 major hepatectomies; the 4 hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgeons (HBPSs), 148 major hepatectomics. Patients in both groups had similar baseline characteristics. The mean±SD blood loss in the LTS and HBPS groups was 1.36±1.37 and 2.21±2.40 L, respectively (P<.001). The mean±SD blood transfusion in the LTS and HBPS groups was 0.27±0.82 and 0.51±0.94 L, respectively (P=.001). Fewer patients in the LTS group required blood transfusion (17/102 [16.7%]; HBPS group, 57/148 [38:5%]; P<.001). We found no difference in overall and disease-free survival between the groups. The median overall survival was 55.8 months for the nontransfused group, and 34.3 months for the transfused group (P=.06). Median disease-free survival was 16.1 months for the nontransfused group compared with 12.4 months for the transfused group (P=.25). Cox regression multivariate analysis showed that transfusion, cirrhosis, and venous invasion worsened overall survival. Venous invasion, cirrhosis, and tumor size adversely affected disease-free survival. Conclusions: The LTS group lost less blood and required less blood transfusions than the HBPS group. Blood transfusion worsened overall survival. The significantly lower blood transfusion requirement of the LTS group contributes to a potential advantage in their overall survival.

0037713343	Thermal ablative therapy for malignant liver tumors: A critical appraisal	The management of primary and secondary malignant liver tumors poses a great challenge to clinicians. Although surgical resection is the gold-standard treatment, most patients have unresectable malignant liver tumors. Over the past decade, various modalities of loco-regional therapy have gained much interest. Among them, thermal ablative therapy, including cryotherapy, microwave coagulation, interstitial laser therapy, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), have been proven to be safe and effective. Despite the effective tumor eradication achieved within cryotherapy, the underlying freeze/thaw mechanism has resulted in serious complications that include bleeding from liver cracking and the 'cryoshock' phenomenon. Thermal ablation using microwave and laser therapy for malignant liver tumors is curative and is associated with minimal complications. However, this treatment modality is effective only for tumors <3 cm diameter. Radiofrequency ablation seems to be the most promising form of thermal ablative therapy in terms of a lower complication rate and a larger volume of ablation. However, its use is restricted by the difficulty encountered when using imaging studies to monitor the areas of ablation during and after the procedure. Moreover, the techniques of RFA need to be refined in order to achieve the same oncological radicality of malignant liver tumors as achieved by surgical resection. As each of the loco-regional therapies has its own advantages and limitations, a multidisciplinary approach using a combination of therapies will be the future trend for the management of malignant liver tumors. © 2003 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

0037842041	Portal vein thrombosis after radiofrequency ablation for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma	Recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) deserves multidisciplinary treatment in addition to surgical resection. Radio frequency ablation (RFA) is an evolving, localized, thermal ablative treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Though the preliminary results of RFA in clinical studies are encouraging, its serious complications should not be underestimated. Portal vein thrombosis as a result of direct blood vessel injury by RFA is rarely reported and is potentially fatal in patients with limited liver reserve due to underlying liver cirrhosis. We present a case of portal vein thrombosis as a complication of RFA treatment for recurrent HCC and illustrate its underlying possible mechanism.

0141763435	Radiofrequency ablation as a salvage procedure for ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma	Spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma is a distinct presentation causing acute abdomen. Different treatment approaches have been advocated including emergency hepatectomy, initial hemostasis by hepatic artery ligation or transarterial embolization and second-stage hepatectomy. Unrecognized ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma during laparotomy is often encountered in countries where the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is low. Radiofrequency ablation is a new localized thermal ablative technique for the treatment of unresectable hepatic tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma. We report a case where radiofrequency ablation was used as a salvage procedure for ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma during emergency laparotomy.

0344665557	Intravenous bolus somatostatin after diagnostic cholangiopancreatography reduces the incidence of pancreatitis associated with therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures: A randomised controlled trial	Background: Previous studies suggested that somatostatin given before endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may reduce the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis. However, the routine use of somatostatin in all patients undergoing ERCP is not likely to be cost effective. This study evaluated whether intravenous bolus somatostatin given after diagnostic cholangiopancreatography could reduce the incidence of pancreatitis in a group of patients undergoing therapeutic ERCP procedures. Methods: In a randomised, double blind, controlled trial, the effect of intravenous bolus somatostatin 250 μg given immediately after diagnostic cholangiopancreatography was compared with that of placebo in patients who required endoscopic sphincterotomy or other therapeutic procedures. The primary end point was the incidence of post-ERCP clinical pancreatitis, and a secondary end point was the incidence of hyperamylasemia. Results: A total of 270 patients were randomised. The somatostatin group (n = 135) and the placebo group (n = 135) were comparable in age, sex, indications for treatment, and types of procedure. The frequencies of clinical pancreatitis (4.4% v 13.3%; p = 0.010) and hyperamylasemia (26.0% v 38.5%; p = 0.036) were both significantly lower in the somatostatin group compared with the placebo group. Conclusions: A single dose of intravenous bolus somatostatin, given immediately after diagnostic cholangiopancreatography, is effective in reducing the incidence of pancreatitis after therapeutic ERCP. This novel approach of administering prophylactic somatostatin may offer a cost effective prophylaxis for post-ERCP pancreatitis.

0842284002	Abdominal Drainage after Hepatic Resection Is Contraindicated in Patients with Chronic Liver Diseases	Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether abdominal drainage is beneficial after elective hepatic resection in patients with underlying chronic liver diseases. Summary Background Data: Traditionally, in patients with chronic liver diseases, an abdominal drainage catheter is routinely inserted after hepatic resection to drain ascitic fluid and to detect postoperative hemorrhage and bile leakage. However, the benefits of this surgical practice have not been evaluated prospectively. Patients and Methods: Between January 1999 and March 2002, 104 patients who had underlying chronic liver diseases were prospectively randomized to have either closed suction abdominal drainage (drainage group, n = 52) or no drainage (nondrainage group, n = 52) after elective hepatic resection. The operative outcomes of the 2 groups of patients were compared. Results: Fifty-]seven (55%) patients had major hepatic resection with resection of 3 Coiunaud's segments or more. Sixty-nine (66%) patients had liver cirrhosis and 35 (34%) had chronic hepatitis. Demographic, surgical, and pathologic details were similar between both groups. The primary indication for hepatic resection was hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 100, 96%). There was no difference in hospital mortality between the 2 groups of patients (drainage group, 6% vs. nondrainage group, 2%; P = 0.618). However, there was a significantly higher overall operative morbidity in the drainage group (73% vs. 38%, P < 0.001). This was related to a significantly higher incidence of wound complications in the drainage group compared with the nondrainage group (62% vs. 21%, P < 0.001). In addition, a trend toward a higher incidence of septic complications in the drainage group was observed (33% vs. 17%, P = 0.07). The mean (± standard error of mean) postoperative hospital stay of the drainage group was 19.0 ± 2.2 days, which was significantly longer than that of the nondrainage group (12.5 ± 1.1 days, P = 0.005). With a median follow-up of 15 months, none of the 51 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in the drainage group developed metastasis at the drain sites. On multivariate analysis, abdominal drainage, underlying liver cirrhosis, major hepatic resection, and intraoperative blood loss of >1.5L were independent and significant factors associated with postoperative morbidity. Conclusion: Routine abdominal drainage after hepatic resection is contraindicated in patients with chronic liver diseases.

0842331403	Impact of Preoperative Fine-needle Aspiration Cytologic Examination on Clinical Outcome in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma in a Tertiary Referral Center	Hypothesis: Preoperative fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination (FNAC) exerts a statistically significant adverse effect on long-term clinical outcome in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: A total of 828 patients with clinical suggestion of HCC received surgical treatment. Ninety-one patients underwent preoperative FNAC, suggesting HCC, and 737 patients did not. Main Outcome Measures: The resectability and histologic diagnoses of liver masses were evaluated in patients with and without preoperative FNAC. Clinicopathologic data and operative and survival outcomes of patients who underwent curative hepatic resection for HCC were compared between the FNAC and non-FNAC groups. Results: The resectability rates of the FNAC (81.3%) and non-FNAC (81.8%) groups did not differ (P=.91). Histologic examination of tumor confirmed HCC in 766 patients. The positive predictive value of preoperative FNAC was 96%, whereas that of preoperative imaging studies was 92% (P=.23). Among patients with nondiagnostic serum α-fetoprotein concentrations (≤400 ng/mL), 3% in the FNAC group (n=66) had benign liver diseases vs 9.5% in the non-FNAC group (n=432)(P=.09). Among patients with curative hepatic resection (70 in the FNAC group and 545 in the non-FNAC group), hospital mortality was 4% and 6% in the FNAC and non-FNAC groups, respectively. In the FNAC group, needle tract tumor seeding was not encountered. Excluding patients with preexisting and iatrogenic tumor rupture, intraperitoneal extrahepatic metastasis occurred in 1 patient (2%) in the FNAC group and in 30 (6%) in the non-FNAC group (P=.34). The cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 79%, 61%, and 48%, respectively, for the FNAC group and 75%, 55%, and 43% for the non-FNAC group (P=.77). The disease-free survival results of the groups were similar (P=.51). Conclusions: Preoperative FNAC has no statistically significant adverse effect on the operability, the possibility of extrahepatic tumor spread, or the long-term survival of patients with HCC. Preoperative FNAC may play a diagnostic role in selected patients with liver nodules on imaging studies when the serum α-fetoprotein concentration is not diagnostic.
