9644289708	Biocompatibility and antibacterial activity of chitosan and collagen immobilized poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid-co-3-hydroxyvaleric acid)	Acrylic acid (AA) was grafted to ozone treated poly (3-hydroxybutyric acid-co-3-hydroxyvaleric acid) (PHBV) membrane. The resulting membranes were further grafted with chitosan (ChS) via esterification. Afterward ChS-grafted membranes were immobilized with collagen (COL). The anti-bacterial activity of chitosan against Staphylococus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reserved after COL-immobilization. In addition, after COL-immobilization, the L929 fibroblasts attachment and proliferation to membranes were improved, and the protein adsorption was decreased. The results indicate that by grafting with ChS and immobilizing with COL, PHBV can not only exhibit antibacterial activity, but also improve the cell attachment as well proliferation for fibroblast. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

14044258580	Amide-containing bismaleimide resins and their copper foil composite materials	Amide-containing bismaleimide (ACBI) resins were prepared using four monomeric reactants: 3,4'-oxydianiline (3,4'-ODA), trimellitic anhydride (TMA), maleic anhydride (MA), and 4-aminobenzoic acid. Their chemical structures were characterized using elemental analysis and FTIR. The peel strength, dielectric constant, dissipation factor, heat resistance, and chemical resistance were studied. The experimental results show that the optimal hot-press conditions for ACBI/copper foil laminates was 320°C and 4.9 MPa. The ACBI laminates treating with 0.2% NZ97 coupling agent had the highest peel strength of 2.097 kN/m. The peel strength was 1.568 kN/m after 24 h at 300°C. The 1 MHz dielectric constant of ACBI was 3.48, and the dissipation factor was 0.0082. After a hot/wet treatment (steam at 100°C) for 72h, ACBI laminates maintained 76% of their original peel strength. After treating in 10% H

1442357662	Effect of blending sodium polyethylene-5-sulfoisophthalate on adhesion of clinical bacteria on polyethylene terephthalate	This work studies the adhesion of clinical infecting bacteria, S. aureus and E. coli, on prosthetic polymeric materials. Membranes were prepared from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) blending at various ratios with sodium polyethylene-5-sulfoisophthalate (SPES). The membranes were characterized by measuring the contact angle, equilibrium water content, and the surface concentration of sodium sulfonate. The results show that sulfonate makes the membrane more hydrophilic. The surface properties of bacteria were determined by measuring the adhesion to n-octane (B%) and the contact angles to water and α-bromonaphthalene. For the four bacteria studied, encapsulated S. aureus was the most hydrophobic and had the highest amount of bacteria attached to the surface of SPES/PET membrane. Furthermore, the attached amount decreased with the increase of the content of SPES. Empirical correlations for predicting the attached amount from the surface properties of both polymer and bacteria were obtained from linear regression. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

14644437704	Effect of take-up speed on physical properties and permeation performance of cellulose acetate hollow fibers	Cellulose acetate (CA) ultrafiltration hollow fibers were spun via the dry-jet wet spinning technique. The effect of the take-up speed on the mechanical properties, morphology, thermal properties, pure water permeation, retention, and surface characterization of hollow fiber membranes were investigated. Both the inner and outer diameters of the hollow fiber decreased with the increase of take-up speed. Macrovoids were observed on the inner surface of the drawn hollow fibers. The d-space decreased with the increase of the take-up speed. The ultimate tensile stress (UTS) increased and the breaking elongation decreased with the increase of take-up speed. The permeation performance was measured. The hydraulic permeability increased and the retention decreased slightly with the increase of the take-up speed. The surface roughness increased with the increase of the take-up speed. The thermal analysis results showed that the endothermic peak shifts to the higher temperature region and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) decrease for a higher take-up speed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

18944381010	Surface characteristics and hemocompatibility of PAN/PVDF blend membranes	Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was blended with polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) at various ratios and made into membranes. The hemocompatibility of the resulting membranes was evaluated based on human plasma proteins adsorption, platelet adhesion, thrombus formation, and blood coagulation time. The PAN/PVDF blends exhibited partial miscibility according to the inward shifting of their two glass transition temperatures. The microstructures of blend membranes examined using atomic force Microscopy (AFM) indicated that the roughness increased with the PVDF content, and the phase separation was too severe to form a membrane when the PVDF content was more than 30%. The water contact angle of PAN/PVDF blend membranes increased with the PVDF content. By blending with 20 wt% apolar PVDF the adsorption of blood proteins could be reduced, and hence the platelet adhesion and thrombus formation was also reduced. However, when the PVDF content was 30 wt%, severe thrombogenicity was observed due probably to the more porous structure of blend membrane. These results demonstrated that the hemocompatibility would be improved for PAN/PVDF blend membranes with appropriate hydrophilicity and roughness. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

22244452951	Effect of coagulant temperature and composition on surface morphology and mass transfer properties of cellulose acetate hollow fiber membranes	Cellulose acetate (CA) hollow fibers were spun via the dry-jet wet spinning technique under various external coagulant compositions and temperatures. The surface morphology of the resulting hollow fiber was examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TMAFM). The pure water permeability (PWP) and the retention of dextran of the hollow fiber were also measured. The results showed that both the temperature and composition can affect greatly the surface morphology and hence the permeation performance of hollow fiber membranes when the temperature was over 55°C and the dimethyl formamide (DMF) content was higher than 15%. The on-line draw ratio increased with the coagulant temperature and DMF content (in the range of 0 to 10%) in the external coagulant. The ultimate tensile strength also increased when the fibers were coagulated in 5-10% DMF and at 70°C. The PWP increased with the DMF content in the coagulant and the coagulant temperature. The retention of dextran decreased with the increase of the DMF content in the coagulant and the coagulant temperature. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

0029831261	Effect of post-drawing on the mechanical and mass transfer properties of polyacrylonitrile hollow fiber membranes	The effects of the drawing conditions on spun polyacrylonitrile hollow fibers were investigated. The drawing conditions included draw ratio, temperature, and concentration of dimethylformamide in the drawing bath. The resulting hollow fiber was examined with a scanning electron microscope. Both the inner and outer diameters of the hollow fibers decreased with the increase in draw ratio. Microvoids were observed on the outer surface of the drawn fibers. The stress-strain behavior of the resulting hollow fibers was measured in both the dry and wet states. The breaking strength increased with the draw ratio, which was higher for the dry samples than for the wet samples. The breaking elongation of the dry sample increased with the draw ratio, whereas the wet sample showed opposite trend. The permeation performance was measured. The pore size increased with the draw ratio. The hydraulic permeability of pure water increased markedly with increase in the draw ratio. However, increasing the concentration of dimethylformamide in the drawing bath reduced the increase in the pore size and hydraulic permeability. On the basis of the analysis of variance, both the pore size and hydraulic permeability were influenced mostly by the draw ratio, and slightly by the concentration of DMF in the drawing bath and by the drawing temperature.

0030073616	Influence of oxidation conditions on polyacrylonitrile-based, activated hollow carbon fibers	Polyacrylonitrile hollow fibers are oxidized at three different temperatures and various durations, and then further carbonized in nitrogen and activated with carbon dioxide. The influence of oxidation conditions on the properties of the resulting activated hollow carbon fibers is discussed. Activated hollow carbon fibers at the highest oxidation temperature have the lowest mechanical properties, and stick together on the surface due to quick heating during oxidation. The higher the oxidation temperature, the larger the size of the pores, and the pores are almost always concentrated at the center of the wall of the hollow fiber. However, activated hollow carbon fibers at the lowest oxidation temperature have higher mechanical properties, fewer pores of large size, and larger surface areas, which exhibit greater hysteresis effects in nitrogen adsorbing at low pressure.

0030107391	Influence of precursor structure on the properties of polyacrylonitrile-based activated carbon hollow fiber	Three types of precursors of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) hollow fibers were used to produce activated carbon hollow fibers (ACHF). These precursors are different in the structure and composition. Characterization were performed including tensile strength, modulus, x-ray diffraction, pore size distribution, and surface area measurement for the resulting ACHF. The results show that the ACHF produced from the precursor with larger crystal size and dense structure has higher mechanical properties, whereas the ACHF from the precursor with smaller crystal size and porous structure has larger surface area and broader pore size distribution. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

0030689329	The effect of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fiber on the mechanical properties of acrylic bone cement	The effects of the addition of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fiber (UHMWPE) on the mechanical properties of standard surgical Simplex-P radiopaque bone cement have been investigated. It was found that the tensile strength and tensile modulus were apparently not improved by the incorporation of UHMWPE in the acrylic bone cement. The results of bending strength and bending modulus indicated that a reinforcing effect is obtained at UHMWPE contents as low as 1 wt%, and then levelled off with increasing UHMWPE contents. When the UHMWPE contents as low as 2 wt%, the values of compressive strength and modulus seemed approximate the same; whereas the values of compressive strength and modulus decreased with increasing UHMWPE contents. From the results of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), the values of dynamic storage modulus of bone cement increased at UHMWPE fiber as low as 2 wt%, but beyond that UHMWPE content the value of the dynamic storage modulus decreased with increasing UHMWPE contents. The same results were also found for the dynamic loss modulus. When methyl methacrylate was grafted onto UHMWPE by plasma and UV irradiation treatment, it was found that by adding the treated UHMWPE fiber in acrylic bone cement had a significant reinforcing effect on the mechanical properties of bone cement.

0031188746	The grafting of methyl methacrylate onto ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene fiber by plasma and UV treatment	In this study, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers were treated with a gas plasma of argon for 5 min. The plasma-treated UHMWPE fibers were put into a methyl methacrylate solution with n-hexane or chloroform as the solvent and irradiated with a UV lamp. The UV irradiation time was changed. The surface topography that had a significant change on the fiber was seen by scanning electron microscopy. Infrared spectra (IR) and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) were also studied to probe the surface atomic chemistry and to identify the functional groups and their relative changes with treatment conditions. The grafting content was estimated by the titration of esterfication method. It was found that the grafting amount for the system with chloroform as the solvent is larger than that for the system with n-hexane as the solvent. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

0031543402	Effect of MMA-g-UHMWPE grafted fiber on mechanical properties of acrylic bone cement	Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers were treated with argon plasma for 5 min, followed by uv irradiation in methyl methacrylate (MMA)-chloroform solution for 5 h to obtain MMA-g-UHMWPE grafted fiber. The grafting content was estimated by the titration of esterification method. The grafting amount of 5280 nmol/g was the largest for the MMA concentration at 18.75 vol%. To improve the mechanical properties of acrylic bone cement, pure UHMWPE fiber and MMA-g-UHMWPE fiber were added to the surgical Simplex-P radiopaque bone cement. The mechanical properties including tensile strength, tensile modulus, compressive strength, bending strength, and bending stiffness were measured. Dynamic mechanical analysis was also performed. By comparing the effect of the pure UHMWPE fiber and MMA-g-UHMWPE grafted fiber on the mechanical properties of acrylic bone cement, it was found that the acrylic bone cement with MMA-g-UHMWPE grafted fiber had a more significant reinforcing effect than that with untreated UHMWPE fiber. This might be due to the improvement of the interfacial bonding between the grafted fibers and the acrylic bone cement matrix.

0031192167	Viscous behavior of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene solution	The viscous behavior of the decalin solution of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMEPE) was studied. The influence of the concentration of polymer as well as the temperature was investigated. The flow curve can be described by the power-law model. The dependence of the viscosity on the temperature can be described by the Arrhenius-Frenkel-Eyring equation. The dependence of viscosity on the concentration can also be described by a power-law correlation. The addition of aluminum stearate increased the activation energy of flow of the solution. The viscosity of UHM-WPE solution was decreased at lower concentration and increased at higher concentration of UHMWPE. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

0031254918	Ethylene glycol and glycerin as the solvent for alkaline treatment of poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabrics	Poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabrics are treated with sodium hydroxide using ethylene glycol or glycerin as the solvent. Compared with conventional aqueous alkaline hydrolysis, the degradation rate in ethylene glycol increases tenfold. The kinetics of the alkaline-ethylene glycol treatment show that the weight loss is linear with respect to time. The moisture regain rate and tensile properties of the treated fabrics are measured; other tests include scanning electron microscopy and dyeing properties. The results show that the properties of the treated fabrics do not depend significantly on the solvent; therefore, using ethylene glycol can greatly shorten the treatment time to achieve results similar to those with the conventional aqueous system.

0032073758	Influence of activation temperature on the properties of polyacrylonitrile-based activated carbon hollow fiber	In this work, polyacrylonitrile hollow fiber was oxidized, carbonized, and activated by carbon dioxide into activated hollow carbon fiber. The effects of the activation temperature on the characteristics of the resulting activated hollow carbon fiber, including the mechanical properties, the surface area, and pore size distribution, were studied. The results show that by activating for 40 min at 800°C, the mechanical properties was better, the surface area was larger, and the pore size was distributed in three ranges. Higher activation temperature led to the decrease in the mechanical strength, the increase in the burn-off degree of the surface, the reduce of the portion of micropores, and the greatly broadening the pore size distribution. Lower activation temperature can only produce pleading on the surface of the fiber instead of open pores, due to the milder attack of CO

The experimental results of ENR/CR blends show that the vibration isolation of ENR is better than that of CR, and the vibration isolation of ENR/CR blends increases with increasing ENR content. Based on the data of vibration transmissibility ratio, ENR has better vibration isolation and the CR has better antivibration. Thus, antivibration and vibration isolation are complemented for the ENR/CR blends. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

0032183542	Effect of quenching temperature on the morphology and separation properties of polypropylene microporous tubular membranes via thermally induced phase separation	Polypropylene microporous tubular membranes were prepared by using camphene as solvent and through thermally induced phase separation at various quenching temperatures. Characterization of the resulting membrane included scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and wide angle X-ray scattering. Microscopic observation showed that the membrane was composed of spherical clusters and had a leafy structure. The crystallinity increased with the quenching temperature. The crystalline structure was of smectic form. Permeation performance was also determined, including pure water permeability and retention of dextran. The results showed that at lower quenching temperatures, the structure of membrane was denser. Therefore, the permeability was lower and the retention was higher.

0032567365	Dynamic mechanical analysis of acrylic bone cement filled with tricalcium phosphate and polyglycolic acid	Tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and polyglycolic acid (PGA) were used as fillers for a commercial acrylic bone cement, Surgical Simplex-P Radiopaque Bone Cement. By comparing the effect of the TCP and PGA on the dynamic mechanical properties of acrylic bone cement, we found that the acrylic bone cement with PGA had a better damping than that with TCP. Bone cement filled with TCP has storage modulus E′ increasing with the TCP content, while that filled with PGA has E′ decreasing with the PGA content. The damping of TCP-filled bone cement was lower than PGA-filled bone cement, and both were lower than that of unfilled bone cement. This indicates that PGA is more compatible with acrylic bone cement than TCP.

24644503104	Influence of coagulant temperature and on-line drawing on the mechanical properties and permeation performance of cellulose acetate hollow fibers	Cellulose acetate (CA) ultrafiltration hollow fibers were prepared via the dry-wet spinning technique. In the spinning process, the coagulant temperature was varied, and hence the on-line draw ratio was affected. The results revealed that the maximal draw ratio increased with the increase of coagulant temperature up to 55°C and then leveled off. The inner diameters, outer diameters and thickness of the hollow fiber decreased with the increase of the draw ratio. The tensile properties of the resulting hollow fibers were measured, and the breaking tensile stress increased with the increase of draw ratio. When the coagulant temperature was increased from 25 to 70°C, the porosity increased, the pore size was slightly enlarged in the outer skin, the hydraulic permeability increased, and the percentage of retention R decreased. In summary, by increasing the coagulant temperature, the maximal draw ratio can be increased, and hence the mass transfer properties and the other properties of drawn CA hollow fiber can be varied. © Springer 2005.

23444447255	Blood compatibility of thermoplastic polyurethane membrane immobilized with water-soluble chitosan/dextran sulfate	Water-soluble chitosan (WSC)/dextran sulfate (DS) was immobilized onto the surface of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) membrane after ozone-induced graft polymerization of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). The surface was characterized with contact angle measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The adsorption of human plasma fibrinogen (HPF) followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The results showed that the surface density of peroxides generated and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) grafted reached the maximum value at 20 min of ozone treatment. It was found that the WSC- and DS-immobilized amount increased with pH and the molecular weight of WSC. The membrane/water interfacial free energy increased with PAA-grafting and WSC/DS-immobilization, indicating the increasing wettability of TPU membrane. The adsorption of HPF on TPU-WSC/DS membranes could be effectively curtailed and exhibited unfavorable adsorption. Moreover, WSC/DS immobilization could effectively reduce platelet adhesion and prolong the blood coagulation time, thereby membrane improving blood compatibility of TPU membrane. In addition, the in vitro cytotoxicity test of PEC modification was non-cytotoxic according to much low growth inhibition of L929 fibroblasts. Furthermore, TPU-WSC/DS membranes exhibited higher cell viability than native TPU membrane. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

27544473897	In-vitro hemocompatibility evaluation of a thermoplastic polyurethane membrane with surface-immobilized water-soluble chitosan and heparin	The surface of a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) membrane was treated with low temperature plasma (LTP) and was then grafted with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), followed by the grafting of water-soluble chitosan (WSC) and heparin (HEP). The surface was characterized with static contact-angle and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that the surface densities of peroxides and PAA reached a maximum when treated with LTP for 90 s. A higher pH of the reacting solution led to higher graft densities of WSC and HEP. After WSC and HEP grafting, the hydrophilicity of the TPU membrane was increased. The adsorption of proteins on HEP-grafted TPU membranes was effectively curtailed. In addition, HEP grafting also reduced platelet adhesion, elevated thrombin inactivation, and prolonged the blood coagulation time. According to the L929 fibroblast cell growth inhibition index, the HEP-grafted TPU membranes exhibited non-cytotoxicity. Overall results demonstrated that the HEP immobilization could not only improve the hydrophilicity but also the hemocompatibiltty of the TPU membrane, while maintaining the ascendant biocompatibility. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

30144445133	Novel silver/poly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposites for surface-enhanced Raman scattering-active substrates	Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-active substrates with high enhancement were prepared by an in situ reduction method. Novel silver/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanocomposite films were obtained, in which the silver nitrate, poly(y-glutamic acid) (PGA), and PVA acted as precursor, stabilizer, and polyol reducant, respectively. The UV-visible spectra of the as-fabricated films showed that the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption band was narrow and of a stronger intensity, which indicates that the Ag nanoparticle size distribution on the substrate was highly uniform. This finding was further confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) measurements. It was found that a PGA-stabilized PVA nanocomposite film revealed the presence of well-dispersed spherical silver nanoparticles with an average diameter of 90 nm.

The effects of CLA immobilization on the blood coagulation, platelet aggregation, and oxidative stress were evaluated using human blood. The resulting CLA grafting CA membranes were characterized with X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS). The complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation time (CT) was evaluated in vitro for the hemocompatibility. Human serum albumin (HSA) and human plasma fibrinogen (HPF) was evaluated for the protein affinity. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by chemiluminescence (CL) method to evaluate the oxidative stress. The results showed that the CLA-immobilizing CA membrane could keep the CBC values more stable than unmodified CA membrane. The CLA-immobilized CA membranes also showed longer CT and less adsorption of plasma proteins. CLA-immobilized CA membrane could keep the CL counts of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide values more stable than unmodified CA membrane. These results suggest that a CLA-immobilized CA membrane could offer protection for patients against oxidative stress and would be helpful for reducing the dosage of anticoagulant during hemodialysis. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The gelation occurred probably due to physical cross-linking of polymer chains by interpenetrating hydrogen bonding. From the results of thermal analysis, PGA/PVA exhibited better thermal stability than native PVA. Although the swelling ratio decreased with the increase of PGA content, however, the water resistance and retention were improved. The tensile strength of the PGA/PVA hydrogel membranes was about 15-30% lower than that of the native PVA, whereas the elongation was increased 2.0-2.6 times. The amount of protein adsorbed and platelets adhered on the PGA/PVA membranes were significantly curtailed with increasing PGA content, thereby showing improved blood compatibility. The as-fabricated hydrogels were proven to be non-cytotoxic evaluated in vitro by L-929 fibroblast incubation. Overall results demonstrate that the non-cytotoxic PGA/PVA hydrogels, due to better water resistance, mechanical properties and blood compatibility could be very promising candidates for blood-contacting medical devices. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of CLA-bonding on oxidative stress and blood coagulation was then evaluated. The surface was characterized with contact angle measurement and FTIR spectroscopy. Blood coagulation, platelet aggregation, and oxidative stress were evaluated using human blood. The complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation time (CT) were evaluated in vitro for hemocompatibility.

In addition, the CL counts of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide values for CLA-bonding PSF membrane were more stable than for unmodified PSF membrane. These results demonstrate that CLA-bonding can improve the blood compatibility of PSF membrane.

To characterize the modified membranes, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water contact angle measurements are performed. It is shown that by coupling WSC as a spacer, the amount of ChS immobilized can be significantly increased. The water contact angle decreases with the amount of PAA, WSC, and ChS immobilized, which indicates the improving hydrophilicity. After WSC- and PEC-immobilization modification, the PHBV membranes possess antibacterial activity against S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and Methicilin resistant Staphylococus aureus (MRSA). According to the L929 fibroblast cell growth inhibition index, the as-prepared PHBV membranes are non-cytotoxic. In addition, the in-vitro evaluation of L929 fibroblast attachment, proliferation, and viability of PEC-immobilized PHBV membranes are ascertained to be superior to those of immobilized WSC or ChS alone. The overall results demonstrate that WSC/ChS PEC immobilization can not only improve the hydrophilicity and cytocompatibility of the PHBV membrane, but also endows antibacterial activity. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The effects of the dope concentration and the bore liquid temperature on the hollow fiber mechanical properties and permeation performance were investigated. The internal surface and cross-section of the resulting hollow fibers were examined using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM), porosity (ε) and the mechanical properties were measured. Dextran of four molecular weights was used to measure the retention. The results show that the tensile strength increased with the dope concentration of polymer and the decrease of bore liquid temperature. In addition, hollow fibers spun from higher dope concentration using lower bore liquid temperature would exhibit lower hydraulic permeability and higher retention. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

33747692352	In vitro evaluation of cellulose acetate hemodialyzer immobilized with heparin	In this study, heparin was immobilized onto cellulose acetate hollow fibers to improve the anticoagulation performance during hemodialysis. In vitro evaluation was carried out using minihemodialyzer circulating with fresh porcine whole blood to simulate kidney therapy. The dialysis performance and hemocompatibility were estimated. The results showed that heparinized hemodialyzer could be used through out the whole dialysis time (4hr) without injecting additional heparin to prevent coagulation in the dialysis system. In addition, the hemocompatibility was evaluated by measuring activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and fibrinogen time (FT). The complete blood count (CBC) including red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), white blood cell (WBC), and platelet were determined. The results showed that heparinization could keep the CBC stable during dialysis, whereas unmodified cellulose acetate hemodialyzer would cause a decrease in RBC unless heparin was injected during dialysis. Heparinized hemodialyzer showed longer APTT, PT, and FT than unmodified hemodialyzer. Heparinized hemodialyzer also showed slightly higher clearance than unmodified hemodialyzer. These results indicated that the dialysis performance and hemocompatibility of cellulose acetate hemodialyzer could be improved by the immobilization of heparin.

The surface of stainless steel (SS) was treated with nitric acid and followed by anchoring aminotrimethoxysilane (ATMS), then a nanolayer of HA was covalently immobilized onto the surface. Heparin was then covalently bonded to the HA-immobilized SS substrate. After repeating 1 to 5 cycles, 1 to 5 layers polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) nanobrush of HA/HEP were resulted with the thickness ranging from 280 to 630 nm (measured with ellipsometry). A model drug (sirolimus) was loaded in the HA/HEP layers at a density ranging from 1.02 to 3.12 μg/cm

33751403603	An in situ reduction method for preparing silver/poly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposite as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-active substrates	Novel silver/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanocomposite films were obtained by an in situ reduction method, in which the silver nitrate, sodium poly(γ-glutamic acid) (PGA) and PVA acted as precursor, stabilizer and polyol reducant, respectively. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-activity of as-prepared nanocomposite films was investigated using benzoic acid (BA) as probed molecule. The results showed that the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption band on silver films was more symmetric with stronger intensity than silver colloidal solution, indicating that the Ag nanoparticle distribution on the film substrate was uniform. The fact was further confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) measurements. It was found that PGA-stabilized silver/PVA nanocomposite film revealed the presence of well-dispersed and spherical silver nanoparticles with average diameter of 90 nm, while the particle sizes were enlarged as the PGA concentration increased. The new substrate presented high SERS enhancement and the enhanced factor was estimated to be 10

33751034330	Effect of draw ratio and coagulant composition on polyacrylonitrile hollow fiber membranes	Asymmetric polyacrylonitrile (PAN) hollow fiber membranes were fabricated via the dry-jet wet spinning process. The effects of the draw ratio and the DMF content in the coagulation bath on the mechanical properties, permeation, and morphology were investigated. The external surface and cross-section of the resulting hollow fibers were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the thermal properties were measured. Additional characterization using X-ray and porosity measurement suggested the improvement in molecular orientation. The results show that the maximum draw ratio increased with the DMF content in the coagulant. The pure water permeability increased while the retention decreased with the increase of the draw ratio. On the other hand, both the permeability and the retention increased with the DMF content. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33846396457	Surface modification of poly(tetramethylene adipate-co-terephthalate) membrane via layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and dextran sulfate polyelectrolyte multiplayer	The improvement of hydrophilicity and hemocompatibility of poly(tetramethylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PTAT) membrane was developed via polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) immobilization. The polysaccharide PEMs included chitosan (CS, as a positive-charged and antibacterial agent) and dextran sulfate (DS, as a negative-charged and anti-adhesive agent) were successfully prepared using the aminolyzed PTAT membrane in a layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly manner. The obtained results showed that the contact angle of as-modified PTAT membranes reached to the steady value after four bilayers of coating, hence suggesting that the full coverage was achieved. It could be found that the PTAT-PEMs membranes with DS as the outmost layer could resist the platelet adhesion and human plasma fibrinogen (HPF) adsorption, thereby prolonging effectively the blood coagulation times. According to L929 fibroblast cell growth inhibition index, the as-prepared PTAT membranes exhibited non-cytotoxic. Overall results demonstrated that such an easy, valid and shape-independent processing should be potential for surface modification of PTAT membrane in the application of hemodialysis devices. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33847625473	Behaviors of controlled drug release of magnetic-gelatin hydrogel coated stainless steel for drug-eluting-stents application	The behavior of drug release controlled by magnetic fields (MF) for stainless steel coated with magnetic-gelatin (MAG-GE) hydrogel was investigated in this paper. X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) and vibrating sample magnetometer were used to evaluate the characterizations of MAG-GE hydrogel and the interaction with the surface of SUS316L. A model drug (sirolimus) was loaded to the MAG-GE hydrogel. When applying MF to the MAG-GE hydrogel, the sirolimus release rate of the magnetic hydrogel decreased by frac(1, 3), comparing to that without the field. This suggests a "close" configuration of the MAG-GE hydrogel due to the aggregation of magnetic nanoparticles which reduced the pore size of MAG-GE hydrogel. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

34548679867	Effect of molecular weight and concentration of PEG additives on morphology and permeation performance of cellulose acetate hollow fibers	Asymmetric cellulose acetate (CA) hollow fiber membranes were prepared by dry/wet spinning process from a dope composed of cellulose acetate (CA), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Herein, PEG was the additive; DMF was the solvent; whereas water was the nonsolvent. The spinning parameters in this study were the contents and molecular weights of PEG and the external coagulation temperature. The surface and cross-section morphology of the resulting hollow fibers were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The pure water permeability (PWP) and retention of dextran were also measured. The results showed that the addition of PEG would suppress the formation of macrovoids. The effect on the suppression was more obvious for PEG with higher molecular weight and higher content. When PEG was added, the outer surfaces changed from smooth to microporous, whereas the inner surface remained smooth and dense. The PWP increased with the additive content but slightly decreased with the increase of molecular weight. Oppositely, the retention of dextrans decreased with the increase of additive contents but increased with the molecular weight. When adding PEG and coagulating at higher temperature simultaneously, the outer surface and cross-section of CA/PEG blended membrane exhibited macrovoids on outer surface and finger-like voids near the inner and outer edges. The resulting membranes showed higher PWP (4-7 times) with slight decrease in the retention. Hence, adding PEG and elevating coagulant temperature will promote the permeation performance of CA hollow fibers. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

34648828704	Surface modification of poly(L-lactic acid) membrane via layer-by-layer assembly of silver nanoparticle-embedded polyelectrolyte multilayer	The improvement of hydrophilicity, antibacterial activity, hemocompatibility, and cytocompatibility of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) membrane was developed via polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) immobilization. Colloidal silver nanoparticles were prepared by using dextran sulfate (DS) as a stabilizer to precede chemical reduction by dextrose. The polysaccharide PEMs, including chitosan (CH) and dextran sulfate (DS)-stabilized silver nanosized colloid (DSS), were successfully deposited on the aminolyzed PLLA membrane in a layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly manner. The obtained results showed that the contact angle of PLLA membranes decreased with PEMs grafting layers and reached a steady value after four bilayers of coating, hence suggesting that full coverage was achieved. The PLLA-PEM membranes with DSS as the outermost layer could resist platelet adhesion and human plasma fibrinogen (HPF) adsorption, while prolonging the blood coagulation time. The PLLA-PEM membranes could possess antibacterial activity against Methicilin-resistant Staphylococus aureus (MRSA). In addition, the proliferation a7nd viability of human endothelial cells (ECs) on PLLA-PEM membranes could be significantly improved. Overall results demonstrated that such a fast, easy processing and shape-independent method for an antithrombogenic coating can be used for applications in hemodialysis devices. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

34648836537	Construction of antithrombogenic polyelectrolyte multilayer on thermoplastic polyurethane via layer-by-layer self-assembly technique	The improvement of hydrophilicity and hemocompatibility of thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) film was developed using surface modification of polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) deposition. The polysaccharide PEMs included chitosan (CS, as a positive-charged agent) and dextran sulfate (DS, as a negative-charged and an antiadhesive agent) that were successfully prepared on the aminolyzed TPU film in a layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly manner. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field-emission scanning electronic microscopy (FE-SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) data will verify the progressive buildup of the PEMs film. The obtained results showed that the contact angle and Zeta-potential reached the steady value after four bilayers of coating, hence proving that the full coverage of coating with PEM layers was achieved. It could be found that the PEMs-deposited TPU films with DS as the outmost layer could resist the platelet adhesion and human plasma fibrinogen (HPF) adsorption, thereby prolonging effectively the blood coagulation times. Besides, the results of growth inhibition index (GI) of L929 fibroblast proliferation suggested that the as-fabricated TPU films were noncytotoxic. Overall results demonstrated that such an easy, valid, shape-independent, and noncytotoxic processing should be potential for the ion of TPU substrate in the application of hemodialysis or cardiovascular devices. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

36049030696	Evaluation of glucan/poly(vinyl alcohol) blend wound dressing using rat models	Aqueous mixture of β-glucan and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was cast into films and dried at 110 °C without chemical crosslinking. The content of glucan in the film varied from 7% to 50%. The hydrophilicity of the resulting films was evaluated with swelling tests, wet area diffusion tests, and water vapor transmission tests. The swelling ratio, the wetting ratio, and the water vapor transmission rate increased with the glucan content. When contacting water, glucan was released, and the percent release of glucan increased with the glucan content. The addition of glucan made the film more ductile than pure PVA. The results of hemocompatibility test showed no significant effect on the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and thrombin time (TT) and minor adsorption of human serum albumin (HSA). On observing the wound healing of rat skin, the healing time was shortened by 48% using PVA/glucan film comparing to cotton gauze. Therefore, a wound dressing made of PVA/glucan can greatly accelerate the healing without causing irritation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

37349018716	Surface immobilization of chondroitin 6-sulfate/heparin multilayer on stainless steel for developing drug-eluting coronary stents	A thin layer of gold was sputtered onto SUS316L stainless steel (SS) sheet. After thiolizing the Au layer with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), layers of chondroitin 6-sulfate (ChS) and heparin (HEP) were alternatively immobilized on the Au-treated SS. The resulting stent would be both anti-atherogenic and anti-thrombogenic. After repeating one to five cycles, one to five layers of polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) of ChS/HEP were successfully fabricated. A model drug, sirolimus, was loaded in the ChS/HEP layers. The SS-ChS-HEP surface was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement. Biological tests including hemocompatibility, drug release pattern, and the inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation were also performed. The results show that the multilayer of ChS/HEP exhibits longer blood clotting time than pure SS substrates. Therefore, this biopolymer multilayer can avoid thrombosis on the stainless. The releasing rate of sirolimus can be controlled through the number of ChS/HEP PEC layers. With a five-layer coating, sirolimus can be released continuously for more than 20 days. Furthermore, the multilayer ChS/HEP loaded with sirolimus can suppress specifically to the growth of smooth muscle cells to avoid restenosis. This suggests that the PEC multilayer of ChS/HEP modified-SS could be applied in making drug-eluting stents. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0033354638	Comparison of solvent removal methods of microporous polypropylene tubular membranes via thermally induced phase separation using a novel solvent: Camphene	A novel solvent, camphene, was used to prepare microporous polypropylene tubular membranes via thermally induced phase separation (TIPS). In this process, camphene was removed by either sublimation or extraction. The effect of the solvent-removal on the structure and properties of the resulting membrane was studied. Microscopic observation and wide angle X-ray scattering indicate that the morphology and crystalline structure difference is minor. Thermal analysis and tensile tests reveal that the crystallinity and breaking strength of the tubular membrane from the extracting method are slightly higher than those for the sublimating method. Porosity measurements show that the sublimation method can yield membranes with slightly higher porosity than the extraction method. Furthermore, permeation results indicate that membranes from extraction have a smaller permeation rate and higher retention. Therefore solvent-extraction can produce a denser membrane structure than sublimation can.

0033106223	Characterization of acrylic bone cement using dynamic mechanical analysis	Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was used to characterize the properties of acrylic bone cement with the addition of tricalcium phosphate (TCP), hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA). The glass transition temperature of acrylic bone cement is >100 °C; the cement has a flat modulus response near human body temperature. The height of the damping peak decreases and becomes broader with increasing TCP content. Thus, TCP is incompatible with acrylic bone cement. When the frequency is changed from high to low, the damping peak shifts to low temperature. The shift in damping peak with frequency indicates that this relaxation is time-dependent. When acrylic bone cement contains TCP with HEMA and EGDMA, the incompatibility between acrylic bone cement and TCP can be ameliorated.

0034065795	In vitro characterization of the occurrence of hemolysis during extracorporeal blood circulation using a mini hemodialyzer	A minimodule dialyzer was made of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) hollow fibers and tested in an in vitro circuit under varying flow rates and blood volumes. Hemolysis occurred in the open circuit in the inlet and outlet chambers. The module was measured to investigate the hemolysis effect during dialysis. The results show that hemolysis ratio (HR) increased with blood flow rate. When the blood speed was increased from 27 to 70 cm/sec, the damaged fraction of red blood cells increased from 0.8% to 1.5%. Shearing in the hollow fiber contributed approximately 13% of the overall HR. Approximately 55% of the overall HR occurred at the inlet and outlet chambers. With increasing blood volume, the contacting surface area per unit blood volume (S/V) and the frequency of pump squeezing of red cells were decreased; hence the damage to the red blood cells and thus reduction of HR.

34247587221	The reduction of oxidative stress, anticoagulation of platelets, and inhibition of lipopolysaccharide by conjugated linoleic acid bonded on a polysulfone membrane	Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) was covalently bonded onto the surface of a polysulfone (PSF) membrane via esterification. The surface was characterized with contact angle measurement and FT-IR spectrometery. The capability of bonded CLA on the suppression of oxidative stress was evaluated. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by the chemiluminescence (CL) method to evaluate the oxidative stress. Furthermore, the removal of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) by CLA-bonding PSF was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The reduction in the platelet adhesion on the PSF surface was evaluated using a SF-3000 automated hematology analyzer. The result indicates that CLA-bonding PSF can reduce the adhesion of platelets by 73%. The concentration of LPS can be reduced by CLA-bonding PSF 1.6 times more than unmodified PSF membrane. In addition, the level of ROS against CLA-bonding PSF membrane was 23% of that against unmodified PSF membrane. Therefore CLA-bonding PSF membrane could offer protection for patients against oxidative stress and could also inhibit LPS for clinical applications. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84861841382	PBAT based nanocomposites for medical and industrial applications	Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) based nanocomposites were prepared by melt blending PBAT with 5 and 10 wt.% of clay nanoparticles (unmodified and modified montmorillonites, unmodified and modified fluoro-hectorites, and unmodified sepiolites). All nanocomposites showed a good level of clay distribution and dispersion into PBAT, especially nanocomposites with high clay chemical affinity with the polymer matrix. DSC results showed that addition of layered silicates slightly hindered kinetics and extent of crystallization of PBAT; however, sepiolite particles were able to promote polymer crystallization kinetics and the transformation of the PBAT crystal structure to a more ordered form. Similar increases in the thermal stability of PBAT in nitrogen and air were obtained upon addition of all clays, due to a barrier effect of the clays toward polymer decomposition product ablation. Preliminary biocompatibility tests indicated that PBAT based materials with 10% clay content have good biological safety and display almost no cytotoxicity. The addition of all nanofillers increased the hardness of PBAT matrix. The DMA analysis showed that all nanocomposites presented higher E′ values than neat PBAT, indicating that addition of clays improved the mechanical properties of PBAT. For layered silicate nanocomposites, the main influencing factors on the thermo-mechanical properties appeared to be the aspect ratio and dispersion of clay nanoplatelets, rather than polymer/clay chemical affinity. The highest E′ values of sepiolite based nanocomposites make this nanoparticle the most attractive material for tissue engineering and environmental industrial applications. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84887278855	Nanohybrid structure analysis and biomolecule release behavior of polysaccharide-CDHA drug carriers	Nanoscaled polymer composites were prepared from polysaccharide chitosan (CS) and Ca-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA). CS-CDHA nanocomposites were synthesized by in situ precipitation at pH 9, and the CS-CDHA carriers were then fabricated by ionic cross-linking methods using tripolyphosphate and chemical cross-linking methods by glutaraldehyde and genipin. Certain biomolecules such as vitamin B12, cytochrome c, and bovine serum albumin were loaded into the CS-CDHA carriers, and their release behaviors were investigated. Furthermore, these CS-CDHA carriers were examined by transmission electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, and X-ray diffraction. The release behavior of the biomolecules was controlled by the CS/CDHA ratios and cross-linked agents. By increasing the concentration of CS and the concentration of the cross-linking agents, cross-linking within carriers increases, and the release rate of the biomolecules is decreased. Moreover, the release rate of the biomolecules from the CS-CDHA carriers at pH 4 was higher than that at pH 10, displaying a pH-sensitive behavior. Therefore, these CS-CDHA hydrogel beads may be useful for intelligent drug release and accelerate bone reconstruction. © 2013 Huang et al.; licensee Springer.

To characterize the immobilizing process, tensile analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed. The cell seeding efficiency and proliferation test were evaluated using L929 fibroblasts. The chitosan scaffolds showed high water vapor transmission rate and antibacterial activity. In addition, ChS-immobilized scaffolds exhibited higher cell seeding efficiency and fibroblasts proliferation. These results demonstrated that the CS non-woven fabrics grafted with GA and immobilized with ChS could be an appropriate candidate for wound healing and artificial scaffolds in the clinical applications.

45849143312	Core-shell magnetic nanoparticles of heparin conjugate as recycling anticoagulants	Polyvinyl alcohol-shell magnetic nanoparticles (PVA-shell MNPs, PMNPs) were successfully prepared by in-situ co-precipitation process. Heparin (HEP) was then covalently conjugated on the PMNPs by using aminotrimethoxysilane (ATMS) and 4,4-diphenyl methane diisocyanate (HMDI) as molecular coupling agent (spacer). The morphology of the core-shell PMNPs was examined using transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectrometry to demonstrate the core-shell structure, as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) to provide direct evidence that the heparin molecules were immobilized on the surface of the core-shell PMNPs. Anticoagulant activity was evaluated with several parameters including activated partial thrombin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen time (FT), and thrombin time (TT). The results show that longer spacer would give better anticoagulant activity since lower steric hindrance can induce higher heparin grafting density. It might be anticipated that PMNPs of heparin conjugate can be used as anticoagulants instead of traditional free heparin, owing to its recycling characteristics by magnetic fields.

5044229345	Hemocompatibility and anaphylatoxin formation of protein-immobilizing polyacrylonitrile hemodialysis membrane	Plasma proteins were covalently immobilized onto polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membrane to evaluate the hemocompatibility and anaphylatoxin formation. This is used as a model to study the effect of protein-adsorption on the blood-contacting response of hemodializing membranes. The proteins used were either platelet-adhesion-promoting collagen (COL) or platelet-adhesion- inhibiting human serum albumin (HSA). The microstructure and characterization of the protein-immobilizing PAN membranes were evaluated by Coomassie dye assay, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and water contact angle measurement. PAN-HSA membrane improved not only hemocompatibility including less platelet adhesion, longer blood coagulation times, and higher thrombin inactivity level, but also induced lower complement activation. On the other hand, PAN-COL membrane exhibited blood incompatibility, although induced less increase of C3, C4 antigens of serum. Overall results of this study demonstrated that the immobilization of HSA onto the surface of PAN membrane would be beneficial to improve the hemocompatibility and to reduce the anaphylatoxin formation during hemodialysis. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

61449106516	Hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility of styrenesulfonate-grafted PDMS-polyurethane-HEMA hydrogel	Copolymerization of polydimethylsiloxane, polyurethane, and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (PDMS-PU-HEMA) hydrogel was performed. After treating with oxygen plasma, the sodium salt of 4-styrenesulfonic acid (NASS) was grafted onto the hydrogel in a one-step process. The surface density of peroxide active groups was determined by the iodide method. The hydrophilicity of the hydrogels surface was evaluated by measuring the water contact angle and water retention. The result demonstrated that oxygen plasma treatment and NASS grafting can improve the hydrophilicity. In addition, in order to evaluate cell compatibility, L929 fibroblasts cells were cultured on the surface of these hydrogels and the cell number was determined by the MTT testing. The results show that plasma treatment and NASS grafting can cause higher cell adhesion and cell growth rates than untreated PDMS-PU-HEMA. Furthermore, NASS grafting can also reduce the platelet adhesion and protein adsorption, hence effectively extending the blood coagulation times. Consequently hydrophilicity, cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility were greatly enhanced by the NASS grafting of PDMS-PU-HEMA. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To conquer the poor compatibility between PCL and MWNTs, the acrylic acid grafted polycaprolactone (PCL-g-AA) and the multihydroxyl functionalrzed MWNTs (MWNTs-OH) were used as alternatives for the preparation of blends. As the comparison between PCL-g-AA/MWNTs-OH and PCL/ MWNTs blends, the former gave much better thermal and mechanical properties than the latter; for examples, 77°C increase in the initial decomposition temperature and 13.3 MPa in the tensile strength at break with the addition of only 5 wt %, due to the formation of ester groups through the reaction between carboxylic acid groups of PCL-g-AA and hydroxyl groups of MWNTs-OH. Finally, the optimal amount of MWNTs-OH was 5 wt % because excess MWNTs-OH caused separation of the organic and inorganic phases and lowering their compatibility. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study, the soft segment consists of poly(dimethylsiloxane) dialkanol having hydroxyethyl propoxy end groups and hard segment consists of isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). The poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA) was added as the chain-extender to form UV-curable silicone marcomer. Finally, the semi-interpenetrating network (semi-IPN) hydrogel was achieved by reacting with silicone marcomer and Pluronic F127 triblock copolymer under UV-photopolymerization (mSi-PU/F127). It was found that the increase in Pluronic F127 content led to decreased water contact angle and increased the water content of silicone hydrogels. Elastic modulus also decreased with Pluronic F127 content, while surface roughness did not significantly differ from silicone controls. The Pluronic F127 content reached 4%, the apparent protein adsorption amount decreased about 60% in comparison with that of mSi-PU control. It indicated that the mSi-PU/F127 hydrogel membrane had an excellent ability to resist protein adsorption. Additionally, the oxygen permeability (Dk) would decrease 24%, as compared with mSi-PU control. Furthermore, these hydrogel membranes were regarded as non-cytotoxic through in vitro L929 fibroblasts proliferation assay. Overall results demonstrated that the mSi-PU/F127 semi-IPN hydrogel provided silicone hydrogel materials not only having relatively high oxygen permeability and a relatively low modulus, but also enhancing hydrophilicity and anti-protein adsorption.

The resulting mat was further crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GTA). The influence of the storing time on the viscosity and gel point of the solution was investigated. The gelatin nanofibers were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) for the fiber size and morphology. The lowest diameter of gelatin fiber (85 nm, without beads) was achieved when the gelatin concentration was 20 wt% and electrospinning was conducted with a voltage of 20 kV over a distance of 10 cm at ambient temperature. The results from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that the softening temperature of gelatin nanofibers crosslinked with GTA was elevated.

This thin layer exhibited both pH response due to the poly(acrylic acid) moiety and temperature response due to the pNIPAAm moiety. The swelling behavior of the membranes was evaluated under various temperatures and pH. The curve of the swelling ratio for the PAN-NIPAAm showed a lower critical solution temperature. Then, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) was loaded into the pNIPAAm layer. The effects of CLA on the blood coagulation and oxidative stress were evaluated with the use of human blood. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by the chemiluminescence (CL) method to evaluate the oxidative stress. Furthermore, the removal of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) by CLA- loaded PAN-NIP AAm was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results show that the LCST swelling curve was at 37°C. PNIPAAm chains form expanded structures under 37°C. At temperatures greater than 37°C, however, the chains form compact structures by dehydration. This makes PNIPAAM membrane due to rapid hydration and dehydration changes of the polymer chain. In addition, the swelling ratio increased by 71% when the pH increased from 5 to 10. The concentration of LPS can be reduced by CLA-loaded PAN-NIP AAm 2.1 and 1.2 times of that by unmodified PAN and PAN-NIP AAm membranes, respectively. In addition, the level of ROS against CLA- loaded PAN-NIP AAm was reduced significantly than that against unmodified PAN and PAN-NIPAAm. Therefore CLA-loaded PAN-NIPAAm membrane could offer protection for patients against oxidative stress and could also inhibit lipopolysaccharide for clinical applications. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The effects of air-gap distance in the spinning of CA hollow-fiber membranes, chitosan concentration, and sorts of aqueous alcohol solutions on the pervaporation performances were studied. Compared with unmodified CA hollow-fiber membrane, the CT-d-CA composite hollow-fiber membrane effectively increases the permselectivity of water. The thickness of coating layer increases with an increase in chitosan concentration. As the concentration of chitosan solution in creased, the permeation rate decreased and the concentration of water in the permeate increased. In addition, the effects of feed composition and feed solution temperature on the pervaporation performances were also investigated. The permeation rate and water content in permeate at 25°C for a 90 wt % aqueous isopropanol solution through the CT-d-CA composite hollow-fiber membrane with a 5-cm air-gap distance spun, 2 wt % chitosan dip-coated system were 169.5 g / m

0035186540	Influence of design of the hemodialyzer inlet chamber on red blood cell damage during hemodialysis	Red blood celt damage occurring in the inlet chamber of a hollow fiber dialyzer was investigated by using a simplified model assembly. To vary the geometry of the inlet chamber, four parameters were used in this study, including the entrance angle, the chamber length, the convergence ratio, and the number of holes. The degree of red blood cell damage was represented by the hemolysis ratio. The results show that the hemolysis ratio was affected mostly by the chamber length and the convergence ratio, and less affected by the entrance angle and number of holes. The hemolysis ratio was the lowest when the chamber length was 2 mm and the entrance angle was 15 degrees. In addition, the hemolysis ratio decreased with the convergence ratio. Because the hemolysis ratio was only slightly affected by the number of holes and the flow channel length, the experimental results of this simplified assembly can be used to improve the design of an actual inlet chamber.

0035342570	Urea permeation and hydrolysis through hollow fiber dialyzer immobilized with urease	The surface of commercial polyacrylonitrile hollow fibers was hydrolyzed and covalently bonded with urease by using glutaraldehyde. Mini-modules assembled with these modified hollow fibers were then used to study the effect of concentration of glutaraldehyde, pH, and temperature on the catalysis of urea. The immobilized amount increased with the concentration of glutaraldehyde. However, urease immobilized with 5% glutaraldehyde had higher activity (0.38μmol/min/mg-urease) than with other concentrations. The activity of the immobilized urease remained at above 0.32μmol/min/mg-urease over wider applicable ranges of temperature (4-70°C) and pH (5-8) compared to free urease. For comparison, the activity of immobilized urease was 0.35μmol/min/mg-urease, while that for non-immobilized urease was 0.33μmol/min/mg-urease at pH 7 and 20°C. The removal of urea using urease-immobilized dialyzer was demonstrated with in-vitro dialysis and showed faster removing rate of urea than a regular dialyzer by 2.7 times.

Prior to the immobilization, the surface of PSF was treated with ozone, followed by grafting with acrylic acid, and then the esterification of NANA. The surface concentration of NANA was determined by 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test. Hemocompatibility, the capability of suppressing oxidative stress, and clearance of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the resulting hollow fiber membrane were evaluated. The results show that by immobilizing NANA onto PSF hollow fiber, the adhesion of platelet was reduced, while both APTT and PT were little affected. Furthermore, oxidative stress was suppressed by NANA-immobilized PSF hollow fibers. The level of LPS was also greatly reduced. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

77953642683	Effect of diallyl disulfide immobilization on the immunoreaction of polysulfone membranes	Diallyl disulfide (DADS) was covalently bonded to a layer of poly(acrylic acid) grafting on the surface of polysulfone (PSF) membranes. The effects of DADS bonding on oxidative stress, removal of cholesterol, triglyceride and endotoxin, and the ability of thrombus prevention were then evaluated. The surface was characterized with contact angle measurement and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Thrombus, platelet aggregation, and oxidative stress were evaluated using human blood. Coagulation times (CT) were evaluated in vitro for hemocompatibility. The production of reactive oxygen species was measured by the chemiluminescence (CL) method to evaluate the oxidative stress. Furthermore, the removal of cholesterol, triglyceride and bacterial endotoxin by DADS-bonding PSF was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that the DADS-bonding PSF membrane exhibited longer CT, and less adsorption of plasma proteins than the unmodified PSF membrane. In addition, the CL counts of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide values for the DADS-bonding PSF membrane were more stable than those for the unmodified PSF membrane. In addition, the DADS-bonding PSF membrane exhibited ability to remove cholesterol, triglyceride and endotoxin. These results demonstrate that DADS bonding can improve the blood compatibility of PSF membranes. The DADS-bonding PSF membrane could offer protection for patients against oxidative stress and could also reduce the dosage of anticoagulant required during hemodialysis. © The Author(s), 2010.

77956494620	Effect of immobilization of polysaccharides on the biocompatibility of poly(butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate) films	Aiming to improve the hydrophilicity, antibacterial activity, cytocompatibility, and hemocompatibility of poly(butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) films, PBAT films were treated with ozone, grafted with chitosan (CS), and followed by covalent immobilization of either heparin (HEP) or hyaluronic acid (HA). The surface graft density of modified PBAT films was detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and dyeing. The surface roughness of PBAT films was measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM). After immobilizing CS, PBAT films acquired antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The adsorption of human serum albumin (HSA) and human plasma fibrinogen (HPF) on PBAT-CS-HEP and PBAT-CS-HA films was lower compared to that of native PBAT. Moreover, HEP immobilization could effectively reduce platelet adhesion and prolong the blood coagulation time, thereby improving the blood compatibility of PBAT. In addition, the growth of L929 fibroblasts was improved for HEP or HA immobilized PBAT, suggesting this surface modification was non-cytotoxic. Furthermore, PBAT-CS-HEP and PBAT-CS-HA exhibited higher cell proliferation than native PBAT. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

0035877202	Microporous polypropylene tubular membranes via thermally induced phase separation using a novel solvent - Camphene	Thermally induced phase separation of an isotactic polypropylene-camphene solution is performed to form tubular membranes. Microscopic observation indicates that the membrane is composed of spherical clusters, a leafy structure, and a cellular structure. Wide angle X-ray scattering reveals that the crystalline regions are basically of smectic form, with α-form crystal formation favored at a lower molecular weight and higher concentration. The crystallinity, as measured with differential scanning calorimetry, ranges between 32 and 43% by mass for these membranes. Permeation performance, including hydraulic permeability and retention of dextran, is also determined. Experimental results indicate that hydraulic permeability increases with increasing quenching temperature. The retention is higher for membranes resulting from higher concentration and higher molecular weight polymers, quenched at a lower temperature. Statistical analysis indicates that the quenching temperature affects hydraulic permeability and retention the most, while polymer concentration affects the crystallinity of the membrane the most.

0036628149	The grafting of chitosan oligomer to polysulfone membrane via ozone-treatment and its effect on anti-bacterial activity	Polysulfone (PSF) membranes were treated with ozone to introduce peroxides, and then grafted with acrylic acid, followed by the coupling of chitosan oligomer. Water soluble chitooligosaccharides (COS) was prepared to induce antimicrobial activities. The surface densities of the carboxylic and amino groups on the PSF membranes were characterized by dyeing determination and the hydrophilicity was evaluated by the contact angle. The antibacterial activities on the PSF membrane were evaluated based on a viable cell counting method. The results show that COS can be covalently bound to the surface of PAA-grafted PSF membrane via the activation of 1-ethyl-3-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (EDC). The water contact angle was lower for the PAA-grafted and COS-coupled PSF, indicating that they were more hydrophilic than the untreated PSF membrane. Only COS-coupled PSF membrane showed a strong biocidal effect for bacteria, including E. coli and S. aureus.

0036525336	Ultrafiltration of myoglobin using surface-sulfonated polysulfone hollow fiber	The usage of ionic polysulfone (PSF) hollow fiber for the ultrafiltration of protein was investigated. The surface of polysulfone hollow fiber was sulfonated through the Blanc chloromethylation reaction to become anionic. Characterization of the modified hollow fiber was performed including ion exchange titration, pure water permeation, and molecular sieving measurement. The performance of ultrafiltration of protein was evaluated using myoglobin at various pH values. The results show that the water contact angles and hydraulic resistance are markedly decreased, indicating that the surface-modified PSF hollow fibers are more hydrophilic. In addition, the retention of myoglobin depends on the pH of the solution. At a pH higher than the isoelectric point of myoglobin, both hollow fiber and the protein have the same charge sign, and both the flux of the solution and the retention are the highest. The sulfonated PSF hollow fiber may be used as a biomaterial for protein separation and purification.

82355191602	Cellular fusion and whitening effect of a chitosan derivative coated liposome	In this study, a derivative of chitosan, N-(2-hydroxyl) propyl-3-trimethyl ammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC), was coated onto the liposomes made of cholesterol and 1,2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). These coated liposomes were loaded with kojic acid for skin whitening. The appearance of liposome was examined using transmission electron microscope (TEM), and the coating of HTCC to the liposome was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. By labeling with Dil, the fusion of liposome with the cell membrane of L929 fibroblast and B16-F10 melanoma was improved by the coating of HTCC. Based on the results of Franz cell experiment, the penetration of kojic acid (KA) through skin was improved by using HTCC-coating liposomes. Furthermore, the cell proliferation of L929 was not affected by HTCC-coating liposomes, while that of B16-F10 was reduced slightly with the increase of the concentration of HTCC-loading liposome. The degree of skin whitening was determined based on the melanin content in B-16-F10 cells. The results showed that the level of melanin synthesis was lower when KA was delivered using HTCC-coating liposome instead of traditional liposome. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

83655184737	Preparation of electrospun alginate fibers with chitosan sheath	In this study, alginate (AL) fibers were electrospun and coagulated with chitosan (ChS) and ethanol using a single spinneret. These fibers exhibited a core-sheath structure that was revealed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and fluorescence-labeled polymers. The resulting fibers were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) for the fiber size and morphology. The average diameter of the fibers ranged from 600 to 900 nm depending on the electrospinning parameters. To mimic the stability of alginate fibers in physiological fluids, the release of alginate from these fibers in normal saline was also tested. The results demonstrated that the core-sheath structure of alginate fiber can greatly reduce the degradation by 40% for 3 d in physiological environment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

82155178876	The effect of covalent immobilization of sialic acid on the removal of lipopolysaccharide and reactive oxygen species for polyethylene terephthalate	Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was aminolyzed with 1,6-diaminohexane (DAH) and then sialic acid (NANA) was immobilized via amidation onto the surface. The surface concentration of NANA was determined by 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test. The hemocompatibility of the resulting PET fabrics was evaluated based on complete blood count (CBC), coagulating times, and protein adsorption. The ability to remove lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was also determined. In addition, the effect of contacting NANA-immobilizing PET on the suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured by the chemiluminescence (CL) method. The results show that by immobilizing NANA onto PET, the adhesion of platelet (PLt) was reduced, and oxidative stress was suppressed. The level of LPS was also greatly reduced. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84855610477	Characterization of Nanocomposites of Poly(butylene adipate-co- terephthalate) blending with Organoclay	Nanocomposites of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) with montmorillonite (MMT) nanoparticles were prepared via solution blending. Natural MMT was modified by octadecylamine (ODA). Intercalation of the organoclay in the PBAT matrix was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results from scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that the surface morphology of nanocomposite of PBAT/ODA-modified MMT was smoother than that of PBAT/neat MMT. From the results of transmission electron microscope (TEM), the dispersion of ODA-modified MMT in the PBAT matrix was finer than that of neat MMT. The addition of organoclay can increase the cooling crystallization temperature of PBAT, as observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Furthermore, the addition of ODA-modified MMT can improve the thermal stability of PBAT nanocomposites, according to the results of thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The tensile strength was little affected, while the Young's modulus was increased with the clay content. The photo degradation and the hydrolysis of PBAT were reduced by the addition of MMT and ODA-modified MMT. Although the hydrophilicity was increased, the transmission of water vapor was reduced greatly by the addition of ODA-modified MMT. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84860468600	Mechanical properties and biocompatibility of electrospun polylactide/poly(vinylidene fluoride) mats	Polylactide (PLA) was mixed with poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and spun into nonwoven mats via electrospinning technique using a co-solvent system of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and acetone. The resulting mats were subject to characterization including contact angle, infrared spectrometry (IR), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), tensile test, and examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM). With such a co-solvent system, the viscosity was measured, and the average fiber diameter achievable without beads for PLA, PLA/PVDF, and PVDF mats was 252 nm, 209 nm, and 355 nm, respectively. Infrared spectra showed that electrospinning can induce crystallization of PVDF. Both á and â phases were observed from the IR and WAXD results. From the results of DSC, the PLA/PVDF mats exhibited higher melting temperature but lower crystallinity than both PLA and PVDF. The tensile strength of PLA/PVDF was lower than those of PLA and PVDF. By applying stretching during eletrospinning, the ratio of strength in machine direction (MD) to that in cross direction (CD) was increased to 2. In addition, electrospun PLA/PVDF mats exhibited higher cell proliferation for L929 fibroblasts than both PLA and PVDF mats. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.

The structure and morphology of electrospun membrane were examined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope and confocal laser scanning microscope. The degree of disintegration of the electrospun mat was assessed. The results showed that the degree of disintegration in DMEM for chitosan alginate mat was 64% of that of conventional calcium alginate mat after 5 days. In addition, the tissue anti-adhesion potential was evaluated with in vitro cell adhesion model and in vivo rat model. About 40% of the animals treated with chitosan alginate exhibited no tissue adhesion between injured peritoneum and cecum.

The appearance of liposome was examined using transmission electron microscope (TEM), and the loading of OHTCC to the liposome was confirmed by infrared spectroscope. The zeta potential of liposome was measured. The antimicrobial activity of liposome against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538 P) was evaluated based on the MIC and MBC values. The results showed that the antimicrobial activity of O-HTCC loading liposome was higher than that of pure O-HTCC. The cytotoxicity of O-HTCC and OHTCC-loading liposome was determined using L929 fibroblasts in vitro via MTT test and morphology of L-929 cells. The results showed that cytotoxicity was not observed when concentration of O-HTCC was below 100 ?g/ml. By labeling with Dil, the fusion of liposome with the cell membrane of L929 was observed, and the efficiency of fusion was improved by the loading of O-HTCC.© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84863887507	Electrospinning of amphipathic chitosan nanofibers for surgical implants application	Novel amphipathic derivative of chitosan (carboxymethyl-hexanoyl chitosan. CHC) was made into mats of nanofibers (?100 nm) via electrospinning. The resulting mats were further cross-linked with genipin. The morphology of CHC nanofibers was examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The optimum parameters of CHC nanofiber was achieved when the CHC concentration was 4 wt% and electrospinning was conducted with a voltage of 20 kV over a distance of 10 cm. The characterizations of biocompatibility, hemocompatibility, and anti-bacterial activity of the nanofibers were also investigated. The results show that CHC nanofibers still preserved antibacterial activity and thrombogeneicity owing to those residual amino groups of chitosan and exhibit high biocompatibility for L929 fibroblast test. Thus CHC exhibited the potential to serve as a novel wound dressing and surgical implants application by these advanced features. Copyright © 2012 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

Full-thickness excision skin wounds were made in normal and diabetic Wistar rats to evaluate the effect of saline, saline plus vitamin C (antioxidant sol), Pluronic F127, or Pluronic F127 plus vitamin C (antioxidant sol-gel). The rate of wound contraction, the levels of epidermal and dermal maturation, collagen synthesis, and apoptosis production in the wound tissue were determined. In vitro data showed that after 6 hours of air exposure, the order of the scavenging abilities for HOCl, H 2 O 2, and O 2 - was antioxidant sol-gel > antioxidant saline > Pluronic F127 = saline. After 7 and 14 days of wound injury, the antioxidant sol-gel improved wound healing significantly by accelerated epidermal and dermal maturation, an increase in collagen content, and a decrease in apoptosis formation. However, the wounds of all treatments healed mostly at 3 weeks. Vitamin C in Pluronic F127 hastened cutaneous wound healing by its antioxidant and antiapoptotic mechanisms through a good drug delivery system. This study showed that Pluronic F127 plus vitamin C could potentially be employed as a novel wound-healing enhancer. © 2012 Yen-Hsien Lee et al.

0036770811	Surface modification and blood compatibility of polyacrylonitrile membrane with immobilized chitosan-heparin conjugate	Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membranes were hydrolyzed with sodium hydroxide to introduce carboxyl groups, and then grafted with chitooligosaccharides (COS), followed by the immobilization of heparin (HEP). The properties of heparin and chitosanimmobilized PAN membranes were characterized with infrared spectroscopy. The surface densities of carboxyl groups, COS, and HEP on the PAN membranes were determined by the uptake of dye. Blood compatibility was evaluated by the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). The protein affinity was determined by human plasma total protein. The results showed that the amount of immobilization of COS and HEP increased with the density of carboxyl groups. The heparinized PAN membrane showed longer APTT and decreasing adsorption of plasma proteins. Less than 10% of heparin was released within 24 h, thus demonstrating the stability of the heparinization. These results demonstrated that the blood compatibility of PAN membranes could be improved by the immobilization of chitosan-heparin conjugate. The results obtained in this study will be helpful for the development of modified PAN for clinical applications.

0037290266	Cholesterol oxidation using hollow fiber dialyzer immobilized with cholesterol oxidase: Effect of storage and reuse	Cholesterol oxidase (COD) was covalently bonded onto the surface of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) hollow fiber via glutaraldehyde. The optimum conditions were found to be at pH 7, -20°C and in the dry state. Immobilized COD retained relative activity above 42% after a 30-day period, when storing at 25°C. After reusing for 30 times, the activity of dry-stored immobilized COD retained 58% of activity. By rinsing with PBS, the decrease in the activity can be greatly reduced. At a flow speed of 1.09cm/s, the immobilized COD can decrease the concentration of cholesterol by about 40% in a 4-h run. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

0037303515	Protein adsorption and platelet adhesion of polysulfone membrane immobilized with chitosan and heparin conjugate	Polysulfone (PSF) membranes were treated with ozone to introduce peroxides, and then grafted with either acrylic acid or chitosan, followed by the immobilization of heparin. The effect of spacer arm on blood compatibility was investigated using three chitosans of different molecular weight [1170 (water soluble), 160 000, and 400 000] and similar degrees of deacetylation (75%). The hydrophilicity was evaluated by measuring the contact angle of water. Blood compatibility was evaluated using the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) as well as the adhesion of platelets. The protein affinity was determined by the absorption of human serum albumin (HSA) and human plasma fibrinogen (HPF). The results show that by the coupling of chitosan, the amount of heparin immobilized can be increased by four times. Water contact angle (from 78° to 41°) decreased with the increase of the amount of heparin immobilized, showing increased wettability. The heparinized PSF membrane showed longer APTT and decreasing platelet adhesion, compared to that of unmodified PSF membrane. The adsorption of HSA and HPF were reduced to 17 and 6%, respectively. This suggests that longer spacer binding to heparin can increase the opportunity of anti-coagulation on contacting blood. These results demonstrated that the hydrophilicity and blood compatibility of PSF membrane could be improved by chitosan and heparin conjugate. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.

Immobilized urease retained 86% of initial activity after reusing 15 times at pH 7. After storing for 42d at 4°C and pH 7, the immobilized urease can hydrolyze 15% of initial concentration of urea at pH 7 and 37°C after 4h, while native urease lost almost its catalytic ability. The removal of urea using urease-immobilized dialyzer was demonstrated with in vitro dialysis and showed faster removing rate of urea than a regular dialyzer by 2 times. Furthermore, the improvement in the urea clearance by the urease immobilization to a dialyzer increased with the dialysate velocity. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Among them, CS-grafted PHBV membrane showed higher antibacterial activity than COS-grafted PHBV membrane. In addition, after CS- or COS-grafting, the L929 fibroblasts attachment and protein adsorption were improved, while the cell number was decrease.

84869209164	Abiotic degradation of poly(DL-lactide), poly(ε-caprolactone) and their blends	An effective hydrolytic degradation of PDLLA, PCL and their blends in a phosphate-buffered solution of pH 4.0 at 37 °C for 18 weeks was achieved, observing a considerably faster degradation of PDLLA as compared to PCL due to the hydrophobic and semicrystalline nature of PCL matrix, able to partially prevent water diffusion into the bulk specimen. DSC and FTIR results indicated that PCL phase, in compositions rich in PCL, was very stable against hydrolysis, but the presence of PDLLA in the PDLLA/PCL blends seemed to catalyze the hydrolytic degradation of the PCL phase, probably associated to easier diffusion of water into the PCL domains by the presence of PDLLA amorphous regions. This last trend was proportional to the content of PDLLA in the blends, excepting for the composition 64%PDLLA/36%PCL. It was confirmed that PCL molecules partially delayed hydrolysis of PDLLA molecules, according to FTIR analysis, and the water diffusion prevention level was proportional to the content of PCL in the blends, except for the system 64%PDLLA/ 36%PCL, which presented a lower extent of degradation than neat PDLLA but higher than the blend 80% PDLLA/20%PCL. This indicated that PCL molecules did not significantly impede hydrolysis of PDLLA molecules in this blend, possibly due to the achievement of a particular structure of the PDLLA/PCL interphase in this blend. In general, hydrolysis of PDLLA/PCL blends was found to be a complex phenomenon depending not only on the content of both polymer phases, but also on the polymer phase crystallinity and morphology. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The distribution of each component of composite scaffold was revealed by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) using fluorescent labeling polymers. The morphology and microstructure of the scaffold was examined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To mimic the stability of these scaffolds in physiological fluids, the degree of disintegration of collagen from these scaffolds in collagenase solution was also tested.

84874713710	Comparison of abiotic and biotic degradation of PDLLA, PCL and partially miscible PDLLA/PCL blend	Important differences between the biotic and abiotic hydrolysis of neat poly(dl-lactide) (PDLLA), poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and a partially miscible PDLLA/PCL blend were found in this work. In abiotic conditions, the degradation process of all the studied specimens mainly proceeded by a bulk degradation mechanism and the diffusion rate of degradation products into the medium was relatively slow after 18 weeks. The hydrophobic and semi-crystalline nature of PCL matrix made this polymer very stable against abiotic hydrolysis, whereas the degradation of PDLLA proceeded much faster due to its amorphous structure. In the first stages of degradation, PDLLA/PCL blend showed that its rich continuous PDLLA phase catalyzed the hydrolysis of the PCL phase, while the low content of PCL molecules partially delayed hydrolysis of PDLLA matrix. In compost, higher levels of degradation were found for all the studied systems during the first 12 weeks of degradation, indicating an important effect of enzymes from microbes in compost on the degradation of PDLLA and PCL. Neat PDLLA and PDLLA/PCL blend seemed to degrade mainly by a bulk degradation mechanism, at least during the first 12 weeks, such as previously observed in abiotic conditions, whereas PCL was preferentially degraded by a surface mechanism due to a very strong catalytic effect of microorganisms on its degradation. Contrary to the abiotic degradation, it was observed that the presence of a low content of PCL molecules in the rich-PDLLA blend did not interfere with the degradation trend of PDLLA in compost, and that the continuous PDLLA phase could partially suppress the biotic degradation of PCL molecules. In general, abiotic and biotic hydrolysis of PDLLA/PCL blends seems to be a complex phenomenon depending not only on the mixing ratio of both polymers but also on their crystallinity, miscibility level of polymer phases and the preferential degradation mechanism of each polymer component. If blends of PDLLA/PCL present a similar level of miscibility, it would be possible to estimate if the presence of the PDLLA or PCL phase could have a general catalytic or delaying role in the blend during the initial degradation stages, depending on which environment they are subjected to and the content of each polymer phase in the blend. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

All nanocomposites were prepared by melt blending using an internal mixer at 140. °C, showing a good level of clay distribution and dispersion into the PBAT matrix, especially those systems based on modified clays and sepiolite. The compression tests of all nanocomposites showed significant increases in the mechanical properties of PBAT matrix, associated to a reinforcement effect of nanoclays. An effective hydrolytic degradation of PBAT and nanocomposites in a phosphate buffered solution of pH. 7.0 at 37. °C was also obtained. The addition of nanoparticles tended to delay slightly the hydrolysis of the polymer matrix in the early degradation stages; afterwards the presence of nanoparticles did not affect significantly the degradation trend of the polymer. Cytotoxicity tests, protein absorption analyses and complete blood count tests indicated that nanocomposites showed good biological safety: non-cytotoxicity, higher in vitro hemocompatibility than neat PBAT and non-negative hemostatic effects after contacting with blood. In general, these results showed that all the studied PBAT based nanocomposites could be very attractive for various tissue engineering applications, particularly to bone defects. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84885718935	Biocompatibility of organically modified nanocomposites based on PBAT	Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) nanocomposites were prepared by melt blending PBAT with 5 wt.% of modified or unmodified montmorillonites (MMT). Addition of clays leaded to enhancements in the compressive- and dynamic-mechanical properties of PBAT. These two mechanical properties were found to be apparently influenced by the clay dispersion level and chemical compatibility of the organic modifier with polymer matrix. The effect of those nanoparticles on the biocompatibility level of PBAT nanocomposites was evaluated through test of protein adsorption, cell proliferation and cytotoxicity of clay powder. Biocompatibility analyses revealed that PBAT and nanocomposites were hemocompatible and non-cytotoxic. In addition, the organic modifier present in nanoparticles seemed not to affect considerably the biocompatibility level of PBAT. Subsequent cytotoxicity tests of pure clays showed that at certain clay concentrations and at short incubation periods clays did not show important cytotoxicity levels; however, for long periods of incubation time further studies should be performed in order to know accurately at which concentration these nanoparticles could have important cytotoxicity effects. © Springer Science+Business Media 2013.

0242691720	Characterization and inhibitory effect of antibacterial PAN-based hollow fiber loaded with silver nitrate	Silver-loading polyacrylonitrile hollow fiber was spun via the dry jet-wet spinning technique from a dope containing 0.5wt.% silver nitrate. The morphology of the resulting hollow fibers was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Ag content in the fiber was measured using an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectrometer. These hollow fibers had a five-layer structure and dense inner and outer surfaces. The average pore size was 20nm and the silver content was 0.19wt.% for the nascent hollow fibers. After flushing with water for 60 days, the silver content in the hollow fibers decreased to 0.1wt.%, and still showed antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. On the other hand, by permeating water through the hollow fibers, silver content was decreased faster and may require periodical replenish. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0343145619	Loose ultrafiltration of proteins using hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile hollow fiber	Ultrafiltration of proteins using hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile hollow fiber was investigated in this work. Polyacrylonitrile hollow fiber was spun and hydrolyzed with NaOH aqueous solution under various conditions. A thin layer of polyacrylic acid was formed on the inner surface of the hollow fiber, and the ionic density on the hydrolyzed surface was determined through titration. The hydrolyzed hollow fiber was characterized with the hydraulic permeability and the retention of dextran. A sharp decrease in the hydraulic permeability was observed between pH 5 and 6, possibly due to the swelling of the hydrolyzed layer. The retention of dextran slightly increased with the ionic density of the hydrolyzed hollow fiber. The retentions of two proteins, myoglobin and cytochrome c, were measured over a range of pH values (4≈10). The results show that the retention of protein changes with pH, and is the lowest at the isoelectric point. Separation of mixtures of cytochrome c and hollow fiber. The selectivity of the cytochrome c over myoglobin was about 40 at pH 5, about 1 at pH 7, and about 0.5 at pH 9.

84915773853	Novel silicone hydrogel based on PDMS and PEGMA for contact lens application	A silicone-based hydrogel was synthesized from poly(dimethylsiloxane) dialkanol (PDMS), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA). The hydrophilicity of the resulting block copolymer was adjustable by manipulating the ratio of PDMS and PEGMA. The results showed that higher PEGMA content led to a lower water contact angle, higher water content, lower elastic modulus and higher glucose permeability. At a PEGMA content of 20%, the protein adsorption decreased to 23% and 18% for lysozyme and human serum albumin (HSA), respectively, of those of the control (PDMS-PU). This indicated that the PDMS-PU-PEGMA hydrogels exhibited an ability to resist protein adsorption. The oxygen permeability (Dk) was 92 barrers for the hydrogel with 20% PEGMA. Furthermore, these hydrogels were non-cytotoxic according to an in vitro L929 fibroblast assay. Overall, the results demonstrated that the PDMS-PU-PEGMA hydrogels exhibited not only relatively high oxygen permeability and relative optical transparency, but also hydrophilicity and anti-protein adsorption; therefore, they would be applicable as a contact lens material. Furthermore, this study demonstrated a new approach to controlling the performance of silicone hydrogels.

84919880578	Magnetic liposomes for colorectal cancer cells therapy by high-frequency magnetic field treatment	In this study, we developed the cancer treatment through the combination of chemotherapy and thermotherapy using doxorubicin-loaded magnetic liposomes. The citric acid-coated magnetic nanoparticles (CAMNP, ca. 10 nm) and doxorubicin were encapsulated into the liposome (HSPC/DSPE/cholesterol = 12.5:1:8.25) by rotary evaporation and ultrasonication process. The resultant magnetic liposomes (ca. 90 to 130 nm) were subject to characterization including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), zeta potential, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer, and fluorescence microscope. In vitro cytotoxicity of the drug carrier platform was investigated through 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay using L-929 cells, as the mammalian cell model. In vitro cytotoxicity and hyperthermia (inductive heating) studies were evaluated against colorectal cancer (CT-26 cells) with high-frequency magnetic field (HFMF) exposure. MTT assay revealed that these drug carriers exhibited no cytotoxicity against L-929 cells, suggesting excellent biocompatibility. When the magnetic liposomes with 1 μM doxorubicin was used to treat CT-26 cells in combination with HFMF exposure, approximately 56% cells were killed and found to be more effective than either hyperthermia or chemotherapy treatment individually. Therefore, these results show that the synergistic effects between chemotherapy (drug-controlled release) and hyperthermia increase the capability to kill cancer cells.

84920640517	Crystallisation behaviour and biocompatibility of poly(butylene succinate)/poly(lactic acid) composites	Biodegradable poly(butylene succinate) (PBS)/poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites were prepared by melt compounding. Differential scanning calorimetry and wide angle X-ray diffraction were used to characterise PBS, PBS/PLA composites and PLA in terms of their non-isothermal crystallisation, melting behaviour, isothermal crystallisation kinetics, spherulitic morphology and crystal structure. The results show that the addition of PLA has a slight heterogeneous nucleation effect on the crystallisation of PBS, particularly in the case of PBS/PLA ratios of 90 :10 and 80: 20. Hence, the crystallisation rate is enhanced during both non-isothermal and isothermal crystallisation of the composites. However, the crystal form of PBS is free from the addition of PLA. L929 fibroblasts cells were chosen to assess the cytocompatibility, and it is found that the cell growth in the neat PBS is similar to that in the PBS/PLA composites.

0346500595	Hemocompatibility of polyacrylonitrile dialysis membrane immobilized with chitosan and heparin conjugate	Chitosan (CS)/heparin (HEP) polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) was covalently immobilized onto the surface of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membrane. The effect of surface modification on the protein adsorption and platelet adhesion, metabolites permeation and anticoagulation activity of the resulting membrane was investigated. Surface characterization such as water contact angle, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscope were performed. The immobilization of PEC caused the water contact angle to reduce, thereby indicating the increase in the hydrophilicity. Protein adsorption, platelet adhesion, and thrombus formation were all reduced by the immobilization of HEP. Anticoagulant activity was evaluated with activated partial thrombin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen time, and thrombin time (TT). The results revealed that PEC-immobilizing membrane can improve antithrombogenicity of PAN membrane. In addition, the PEC-immobilized membranes can suppress the proliferation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vitro cytotoxicity test showed leachable substance released was below cytotoxic level. The pure water permeability results show little variation due to PEC-immobilization. Thus PEC-immobilization can endow the PAN membrane hemocompatibility and antibacterial activity while retaining the original permeability. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
