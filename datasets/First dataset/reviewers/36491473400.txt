84940314308	Carboxymethylated chitosan effects on proliferation of Schwann cells and expression of nuclear factor kappa B	Background: Carboxymethylated chitosan is shown to promote some kinds of cells proliferation, but its effects on proliferation of Schwann cells need further studies. Objective: To investigate the effects of carboxymethylated chitosan on proliferation of Schwann cells and expression of nuclear factor-κB in cultured Schwann cells. Methods: Schwann cells from Sprague-Dawley rats at logarithmic growth phase were seeded in 96-well plates, and cultured respectively with PBS, 0, 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1 000 mg/L carboxymethyl chitosan for 24 hours. Cell proliferation was detected using the cell counting kit-8 assay. After trypsin digestion, Schwann cells from Sprague-Dawley rats at logarithmic growth phase were used to prepare cell suspensions, which were seeded in 6-well cell culture plates and cultured respectively with 50, 100 and 200 mg/L carboxymethyl chitosan and PBS for 24 hours. Then, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine, real-time PCR and western blot assay were performed. Results And Conclusion: Cell counting kit-8 and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine detection results showed that carboxymethyl chitosan at 50-1000 mg/L, especially at 200-500 mg/L, could promote Schwann cell proliferation. Real-time PCR and western blot results showed 50-200 mg/L carboxymethyl chitosan could promote nuclear factor κB mRNA and protein expression in Schwann cells in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting carboxymethyl chitosan can promote Schwann cell proliferation and expression of nuclear factor-κB in Schwann cells cultured in vitro.

23244438492	Study on the relationship between LOH and MI of FHIT gene and the development of cervical carcinoma	Objective: To explore the relationship of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MI) of fragile histidine triad (FHIT) gene to the development of cervical carcinoma. Methods: Two sites of microsatellite polymophism in FHIT gene were selected to detect LOH and MI in 60 cases of primary invasive cervical carcinoma and 35 cases of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN). Results: At D3S1234 and D3S1300, the LOH rates of primary invasive cervical carcinomas were 45.0% (27/60) and 38.3% (23/60), the MI rates were 18.3% (11/60) and 11.7% (7/60), respectively. The LOH rates of CINs were 42.9% (15/35) and 37.1% (13/35), the MI rates were 11.4% (4/35), 8.6% (3/35), respectively. There were no significant differences between invasive cervical carcinomas and CINs in respect to their positive rates of LOH and MI at D3S1234 and D3S1300 (P>0.05). There were significant differences in LOH rates at D3S1234 and D3S1300 between the well/moderately differentiated cervical carcinomas and the poorly differentiated invasive cervical carcinomas (P<0.05). Significant differences were noted between the invasive cervical carcinomas with lymph node metastasis and those without lymph node metastasis in regard to their LOH and MI at the two sites (P< 0.05). The positive rates of LOH and MI for CIN III and noninvasive cervical carcinomas were higher than those for CIN I-II. Conclusion: The FHIT gene change is a relatively late event in CINs. The detection of the LOH of FHIT gene might be helpful to the early diagnosis and the screening of cervical carcinoma. It might also be useful for predicting the prognosis of cervical carcinoma.

3042737067	Molecular design of synthetic biodegradable polymers as cell scaffold materials	Poly(lactic acid) and its copolymers are regarded as the most useful biomaterials. The good biocompatibility, biodegradability and mechanical properties of them make the synthetic biodegradable polymers have primary application to tissue engineering. The advantages and disadvantages of the synthetic biodegradable polymers as cell scaffold materials are evaluated. This article reviews the modification of polylactide-family aliphatic polymers to improve the cell affinity when the polymers are used as cell scaffolds. We have developed four main approaches: to modify polyester cell scaffolds in combination of plasma treating and collagen coating; to introduce hydrophilic segments into aliphatic polyester backbones t to introduce pendant functional groups into polyester chains; to modify polyester with dextran. The results of the cell cultures prove that the approaches mentioned above have improved the cell affinity of the polyesters and have modulated cell function such as adhesion, proliferation and migration.

33748526465	Synthesis and degradation of biodegradable photo-cross-linked poly(α,β-malic acid)-based hydrogel	To create a new biodegradable hydrogel, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) was grafted on poly(α,β-malic acid) (PMA) and ultraviolet (UV) photo-cross-linked. PMA was synthesized by polycondensation of L-malic acid without catalyst. The effects of the polycondensation reaction time and temperature on the polymer properties were studied. Increased temperature (in the range 110-130°C) accelerated intramolecular dehydration and depolymerization side reactions, increasing the low molecular weight fraction. The intramolecular dehydration was more sensitive to temperature than to reaction time. The photo-cross-link was carried out in the presence of photoinitiator Irgacure 2959. The gel content increased with increasing polymer concentration. The water uptake of PMA-based hydrogel ranged from 170% to 480% as the HEMA content varied from 12 to 4 mol %, respectively. The degradation behavior of PMA-based hydrogel was investigated. The weight loss of hydrogel was closely related to the HEMA grafting content and polymer concentration. Hydrogel degradation was found to proceed simultaneously at the surface and in the bulk of the hydrogels. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

84896982523	Smart Nanovehicles based on ph-triggered disassembly of supramolecular peptide-amphiphiles for efficient intracellular drug delivery	A novel type of nanovehicle (NV) based on stimuli-responsive supramolecular peptide-amphiphiles (SPAs, dendritic poly (L-lysine) non-covalently linked poly (L-leucine)) is developed for intracellular drug delivery. To determine the pH-dependent mechanism, the supramolecular peptide-amphiphile system (SPAS) is investigated at different pH conditions using a variety of physical and chemical approaches. The pH-triggered disassembly of SPAS can be attributed to the disappearance of non-covalent interactions within SPAs around the isoelectric point of poly (L-leucine). SPAS is found to encapsulate guest molecules at pH 7.4 but release them at pH 6.2. In this way, SPAS is able to act as a smart NV to deliver its target to tumor cells using intracellular pH as a trigger. The DOX-loaded NVs are approximately 150 nm in size. In vitro release profiles and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images of HepG2 cells confirm that lower pH conditions can trigger the disassembly of NVs and so achieve pH-dependent intracellular DOX delivery. In vitro cytotoxicity of the DOX-loaded NVs to HepG2 cells demonstrate that the smart NVs enhance the efficacy of hydrophobic DOX. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and CLSM results show that the NVs can enhance the endocytosis of DOX into HepG2 cells considerably and deliver DOX to the nuclei. A smart nanovehicle for use as a novel drug nanocarrier is designed based on a supramolecular peptide-amphiphile system (SPAS). SPAS exists as a well-defined nanostructure at pH 7.4, but the whole SPAS system disassembles at pH 6.2. Because SPAS can encapsulate anticancer drugs at normal physiological conditions, and it can disassemble to release the drug at the pH levels found inside tumor cells. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84897563265	Polymeric micelles with π-π Conjugated moiety on glycerol dendrimer as lipophilic segments for anticancer drug delivery	Polymeric micelles are important nanovehicles for anticancer drug delivery. The lipophilic segment in polymeric micelles is an important factor to affect the drug loading properties. In our previous work, we found that small molecules with π-π conjugated structures could be used to replace hydrophobic polymeric chains as lipophilic segments for anticancer drug delivery. Herein, we report a novel polymeric micelle with π-π conjugated cinnamate moiety on glycerol dendrimer as lipophilic segment, the modified dendritic segment was connected to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) via click chemistry. The received amphiphiles self-assembled into micelles in aqueous medium. The properties of the polymeric micelles such as critical micelle concentration (CMC), mean size and morphology were investigated. Anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded in the polymeric micelles. The π-π interaction, drug release profile and in vitro anticancer efficiency of the DOX loaded micelles were studied. The results showed that the micelles with more cinnamate moieties exhibited a lower CMC. The drug loading content and release rate of the micelles increased with increasing generation of glycerol dendrimer. Strong π-π stacking interaction was detected between DOX and carriers. The DOX loaded polymeric micelles exhibited efficient anticancer activity in vitro. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.

84908441331	Fabrication of self-assembling peptide nanofiber hydrogels for myocardial repair	Myocardial infarction (MI) has become widely spread in clinical medicine, and results in massive loss of myocardium, ventricular remodeling and ultimately heart failure. Many strategies for repairing injured myocardium are under extensive investigation with some early encouraging effects, but cannot effectively prevent disease progression and heart failure. Cardiac tissue engineering has emerged as an increasingly important approach to repair infarcted myocardium. Self-assembling peptide nanofiber hydrogels are regarded as tailored biomaterial scaffolds with the aim to develop cardiac tissue engineering. Their fabrication is based on the principle of molecular self-assembly which allows tailoring of the biological features (e.g. modification with functional motifs and controlled release of signal molecules) of supramolecular structures for cell behaviors and tissue regeneration. This review will outline the potential of combinational treatments of peptide nanofiber hydrogels with cells, growth factors, or both together in myocardial repair. This journal is

44449174010	Improve the chemosensitivity of resistant ovarian cancer cell by small RNA, interference	Objective To investigate the effects of siRNA on the drug resistance reversal of ovarian cancer cell. Methods The siRNA was transfected into human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR8/TR by liposome. ATP-bioluminence assay was applied to measure the drug sensitivity to four chemotherapeutic agents before and after transfection. Results ATP-bioluminence assay showed that OVCAR8/TR cells were resistant to cDDP, ADM and Taxol. After siRNA transfection, OVCAR8/TR cells were sensitive to ADM and Taxol which are tansported by P-gp. The inhibition rate of ADM was improved from 37% to 58%, and that of Taxol was improved from 26% to 78%. However, the resistance of OVCAR8/TR cells to cDDP was not reversed. Conclusion siRNA can effectively improve the drug resistance to chemotherapeutic agents which are transfered by P-gp. The RNA interference can reverse MDR1-mediated drug resistance in ovarian cancer cell.

44349172367	Preparation and characterization of novel polymeric micelles for 9-nitro-20(S)-camptothecin delivery	9-Nitro-20(S)-camptothecin (9-NC) has achieved remarkable curative effect in anticancer research. However, the clinical application of 9-NC is largely hampered by its poor solubility and stability. In this paper, novel amphiphilic block copolymers derived from d,l-lactide, trimethylene carbonate, and methylated poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) (PECA) with different molecular weight were synthesized and characterized. Self-assembly PECA micelles loaded with 9-NC were prepared. The micelles were regular spheres with a diameter ranged from 20 to 120 nm. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) decreased with the increase of the hydrophobic components. The solubility of 9-NC was improved obviously with micelle encapsulation. The stability experiments proved that over 90% of 9-NC could keep its lactone form in micelle solution after incubating in phosphate-buffered saline for 100 min, while the corresponding proportion for free drug solution was 25%. The release of 9-NC was nearly zero-order after the burst release, and the long hydrophobic chain length led to slower release rate. The novel PECA copolymer micelles could be effective carriers to improve the solubility, stability, and release performance of 9-NC. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Physicochemical and biological properties of all liposomes and lipoplexes were evaluated, including lipid-DNA interactions, size, morphology, zeta potential, acid-base buffering capability, protection of DNA from DNase I digestion, and cytotoxity. The efficiency of luciferase gene transfection of lipoplexes 1-3 was compared with that of commercial dioleoyl-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) in 293T cells and HepG2 cells with or without poly(ethylene glycol) PEG stabilizer. The complexation and protection of DNA of liposome 3 was the strongest among the three liposomes. The efficiency of gene transfection of liposomes 1-3 was two-to threefold higher than that of PEI and/or DOTAP in 293T cells. Liposomes 1 and 3 in PEG as stabilizer showed sixfold higher transfection efficiency than that of PEI and/or DOTAP, whereas liposome 2 showed very low transfection efficiency. In HepG2 cells, the transfection efficiency of all the cationic liposomes was much lower than that of DOTAP. In conclusion, lipids 1-3 were efficient and non-toxic gene vectors; the headgroup of cationic lipids and the stabilizer of liposome formulation had an important influence on gene transfection. © 2008 The Pharmaceutical Society of Korea.

65349103045	The polymeric crystallinity effect on the responses of bone marrow stromal cells	The cell-material interaction is an important factor to be considered in the applications of biomaterials. The properties of biomaterials, for example crystallinity, would change the cell behaviors such as proliferation, differentiation, morphology and so on. In this article, the research was focused on the relationship between the crystallinity of polymeric substrates and the cell responses. Two kinds of biodegradable poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) films with different crystallinity were prepared and used as substrates for cell behavior study. The PLLA films were fabricated with crystallinity of 19% and 69% through solution casting and isothermal processing, respectively. The crystallinity of PLLA films was characterized by DSC and XRD. The surface morphologies of PLLA films with different crystallinity were observed by SEM. Bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) isolated from the marrow of new born male Sprague Dawley rats were cultured on the films. The cell morphology, proliferation, total protein amount and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities were tested. The results showed that the crystallinity of PLLA films affected the behavior of MSCs greatly.

The surface properties of the four polylactide films were tested and the osteoblastic ROS 17/2.8 cells were cultured on the films. The protein adsorption behaviors of fibrinogen and bovine serum albumin on films were studied. The cell proliferation, total protein amount, DNA content and alkaline phosphatase activity of osteoblastic ROS 17/2.8 cells were evaluated. The results showed that the protein adsorption was dependant on the type of proteins. The observation of cell morphologies revealed that the PDLA film provide an unfavorable surface for cell attachment. The total protein amount, DNA content and ALP activity were closely related to the stereoforms of polylactide films. All the levels of total protein amount, DNA content and ALP activity of ROS 17/2.8 cells on PDLA film were decreased. The racemic stereocomplex of PLLA and PDLA showed relatively higher positive effects on both cell growth and proliferation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two series of ICs with mPEG750 and mPEG2000 were prepared. The stoichiometry (EG/CD) of all the ICs in mPEG2000 series was 3.1, no matter what the graft degree was. While in mPEG750 series, the stoichiometry (EG/CD) was very different; it increased with the amount of mPEG decreasing. The decomposition temperatures of the fragments in ICs were closely related to graft degrees. The stack of α-CDs in ICs was a channel-type structure. The crystal of ICs was lamellar, and it could be reorganized to well-defined supermolecular structure. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.

76349102822	A novel calcium phosphate ceramic-magnetic nanoparticle composite as a potential bone substitute	A magnetic field has been applied to accelerate bone healing for a long time. In this study, in order to combine the bone repair capability of calcium phosphate (CaP) ceramics with the magnetic field, a novel CaP ceramic-magnetic nanoparticle (CaP-MNP) composite was fabricated through integrating the superparamagnetic nanoparticles into the CaP ceramics. Two kinds of CaP ceramics were chosen: hydroxyapatite (HA) and HA/tricalcium phosphate (65/35, HT). The samples were cultured with Ros17/2.8 and MG63 cells respectively in vitro to evaluate the cell proliferation and differentiation via MTT and alkaline phosphatase activity tests. In order to find the influence of the magnetic materials on the expression of the bone morphological protein (BMP), the samples composited with BMP-2 were implanted subcutaneously in the fasciae of rat back muscles for 30 days. Compared with ordinary CaP ceramics, the results indicated that the CaP-MNP composite had good biocompatibility and was able to promote cell proliferation and differentiation significantly. The in vivo test showed that the expression of BMP-2 would be accelerated by HT composited with MNPs, and new bone-like tissue formation could be observed. Accordingly, it might be expected that this CaP-MNP composite could become a potential bone substitute or bone tissue engineering scaffold. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.

77951660853	Effects of hydroxyapatite nanoparticle on remineralization of artificial root caries in vitro	An in vitro pH cycling model was used to evaluate the effect of nano-hydroxyapatite on the remineralization of artificial root caries. Sound human teeth fragments obtained from the cervical portion of the root were immersed in a demineralization solution for 96 h at 37°C to induce artificial root caries lesions. The demineralized samples were pH-cycled through treatment solutions, acidic buffer and neutral buffer for 8 days at 6 cycles per day. The samples were subsequently evaluated using a microhardness tester and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Nano-hydroxyapatite (nano-HA) and fluoride significantly increased the microhardness of the lesions (p < 0.05) when compared to a control group. SEM revealed nano-HA adhered to the dentin surface densely and some of them even covered the openings of dentin tubules. We concluded that nano-HA positively affects the demineralization and/or remineralization processes of artificial root caries lesions and may be a promising agent for non-invasive root caries therapy. ©2010 IEEE.

77952892318	Effect of sodium oleate as a buffer on the synthesis of superparamagnetic magnetite colloids	In this study, superparamagnetic monodisperse magnetite colloids, around 5. nm in size, were prepared by dissolving iron chlorides, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium oleate (NaOL), in toluene/ethanol/water mixtures and refluxing for 4. h. The concentrations of NaOH and NaOL were varied to systematically investigate the effect on the surface properties, size, dispersion, and magnetic properties of magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs). The samples were characterized via XRD, FTIR, TGA, TEM, SAED, DLS, and VSM. The results indicated that the surface coatings of MNPs could be manipulated from oleate to hydroxyl groups via increasing the molar ratio of NaOH/Fe(II) more than 8. The amount of NaOH had no obvious influence on the size and the saturation magnetization of MNPs. Therefore NaOH was not a necessary reactant for forming magnetite crystals. On the contrary, NaOL was shown to be the most important component for synthesizing stable magnetite colloids. The NaOL acted as both a key reactant to buffer the pH environment and a surfactant to keep the MNPs stable in nonpolar solvent media. © 2010.

79952118463	Study on poly(L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate): Synthesis and cell compatibility of electrospun film	The biomedical applications of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) were limited by its high crystallinity. In this paper, the copolymerization of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and L-lactide (LLA) was carried out to improve the flexibility of PLLA. The effects of feeding dose, reaction temperature and polymerization time were investigated, and the copolymers were characterized with 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared reflection, gel permeation chromatography differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and x-ray diffraction. The copolymers were electrospun to form porous films to study their cell compatibility. The results showed that the composition of the copolymer was nearly the same as that in the feeding dose, and the molecular weight of the copolymer decreased with increasing TMC content. The decrease in the reaction temperature and polymerization time would increase the molecular weight, but the composition deviates from the feeding dose. NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cells were cultured on the electrospun films. The morphology and proliferation of the cells were studied. The results implied that the cell compatibility of poly(L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate) copolymer was much better than that of the PLLA homopolymer. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Then ligands of different dendritic generations (G1 to G3) were immobilized on the surface of oleic-acid-coated hydrophobic MNPs via ligand-exchange method to realize phase transfer. The two series of modified MNPs were systematically studied via FTIR, TGA, XRD, TEM, DLS, VSM and zeta potential measurements. The modified MNPs exhibited an adjustable number of terminal functional groups and superior stability in aqueous solutions in a broad pH range. The surface existence of water-soluble polypeptide ligands promoted monodispersity of the particles and led to an increased hydrodynamic diameter under 30 nm from G1 to G3. After the ligand exchange process, the superparamagnetic behavior was successfully retained. The two series of modified MNPs exhibited approximate magnetization in the same generation, while the saturation magnetization of the MNPs decreased with increasing surface dendritic generation. MNPs functionalized with G1l-glutamic acid dendritic ligands had the highest saturation magnetization (55 emu g

79953236290	Effects of headgroups and serum on gene transfection of alkaline amino acid based cationic lipids	Three cationic lipids with lysylated(1), histidylated(2), and arginylated(3) headgroups and cholesterol hydrophobic moiety were synthesized. The average sizes of liposomes and lipoplexes were around 100 and 160 nm, respectively. The gene transfection efficiency of the three lipoplexes loaded with pGL3 or pORF-LacZ was compared on 293T cells in the presence or the absence of serum. The transfection efficiency of the three lipoplexes in a serum- free medium was 2 to 3-fold higher than that of dioleoyl-trimethylammonium propane(DOTAP). In the presence of serum, however, most of the lipoplexes showed lower transfection activities; only lipoplex 3 retained its high transfection efficiency.

79953252244	Gene transfer efficacies of serum-resistant amino acids-based cationic lipids: Dependence on headgroup, lipoplex stability and cellular uptake	Serum is a major obstacle to efficient cationic liposome-mediated gene transfection. In this paper, three alkaline amino acids based cationic lipids including lysinylated cholesterol (lipid 1), histidinylated cholesterol (lipid 2) and argininylated cholesterol (lipid 3) were used as non-viral gene vectors. The physicochemical properties such as size, Zeta potential, stability and cellular uptake of the lipoplexes formed from lipids 1-3 as well as the transfection efficacies with or without serum were investigated. The results demonstrated that lipid 1 and lipid 3 showed good properties in lipoplex stability and cellular uptake. Interestingly, lipid 3-based liposome showed serum-enhanced effect on the gene transfection. The transfection efficiency of lipid 1 and lipid 3 was remarkably higher than that of lipid 2. Moreover, they exhibited 10-20-fold more efficaciously than the control, 1,2-dioleoyloxy-3- (trimethylammonio)-propane (DOTAP) liposome in serum-containing media. The data suggested the strong effect of the type of the headgroup on gene transfection. The lysine/arginine derivative cationic lipids could be promising nonviral vectors for gene delivery in vivo. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

79954608481	Peptide dendrimers as efficient and biocompatible gene delivery vectors: Synthesis and in vitro characterization	We report the synthesis and characterization of different generations of dendritic poly(l-lysine) vectors, and their use for in vitro gene transfection. Gel retardation assay revealed that the dendrimers could form complexes with plasmid DNAs (pDNAs), evident from the inhibition of the migration of pDNA at the N/P ratios of 0.5, 1 and 2 by G3, G4 and G5 dendritic generations, respectively. DNase I assay revealed the protection of pDNA acquired from the complexation with dendrimers from nuclease-catalyzed degradation, with the protection capacity of G5 being even stronger than poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that all 4 generations of dendrimer/DNA complexes studied were of similar particle sizes within 100-200 nm. Zeta potential measurements showed that as the N/P ratio increased from 1 to 25, all dendrimer/pDNA complexes gradually changed from negative to positive charges. The higher generations tended to produce the greater positive potentials, indicating a stronger potency of the complexes to interact with negatively charged cell membranes. In vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity evaluations showed good biocompatibility of the dendrimers and their complexes over the different N/P ratios studied. In vitro gene transfection revealed higher efficiency of G5 than other dendrimers and insensitive variation to the presence of serum. Given its similar transfection efficiency to PEI but lower toxicity to cultured cells, dendrimer G5 could be a better candidate for gene delivery. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The morphology and properties of the nanoparticles such as pH sensitivity, zeta potential and mean diameters were investigated. The cytotoxicity of PEG-PH-PLLA nanoparticles was evaluated. Doxorubicin (DOX) was encapsulated in the nanoparticles to explore the release profile. The drug-loaded nanoparticles were incubated with HepG2 cells to study the in vitro anti-tumor effect. The results showed the sizes of both blank nanoparticles and drug-loaded nanoparticles in pH 7.4 were smaller than those of nanoparticles in pH 5.0, and the mean diameter of drug-loaded nanoparticles was much bigger than that of blank nanoparticles. The PEG-PH-PLLA nanoparticles were nontoxic to both NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and HepG2 cells. The release profile showed that the release of DOX in pH 5.0 was much faster than that in pH 7.4. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that the anti-tumor effect of drug-loaded nanoparticles was preferable to free doxorubicin. The pH-sensitive PEG-PH-PLLA nanoparticles are promising carriers for anti-tumor drug delivery. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79958266512	Characterization of 9-nitrocamptothecin liposomes: Anticancer properties and mechanisms on hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo	Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer related mortality worldwide. 9-Nitrocamptothecin (9NC) is a potent topoisomerase-I inhibitor with strong anticancer effect. To increase the solubility and stability, we synthesized a novel 9NC loaded liposomes (9NC-LP) via incorporating 9NC into liposomes. In the present study, we determined the effects of 9NC and 9NC-LP on in vitro and in vivo, and the underlying mechanisms. Methodology/Principal Findings: We first analyzed the characteristics of 9NC-LP. Then we compared the effects of 9NC and 9NC-LP on the proliferation and apoptosis of HepG2, Bel-7402, Hep3B and L02 cells in vitro. We also investigated their anticancer properties in nude mice bearing HCC xenograft in vivo. 9NC-LP has a uniform size (around 190 nm) and zeta potential (~-11 mV), and exhibited a steady sustained-release pattern profile in vitro. Both 9NC and 9NC-LP could cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a dose-dependent and p53-dependent manner. However, this effect was not ubiquitous in all cell lines. Exposure to 9NC-LP led to increased expression of p53, p21, p27, Bax, caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 and apoptosis-inducing factor, mitochondrion-associated 1 and decreased expression of Bcl-2, cyclin E, cyclin A, Cdk2 and cyclin D1. Furthermore, 9NC-LP exhibited a more potent antiproliferative effect and less side effects in vivo. Western blot analysis of the xenograft tumors in nude mice showed similar changes in protein expression in vivo. Conclusions/Significance: In conclusion, 9NC and 9NC-LP can inhibit HCC growth via cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. 9NC-LP has a more potent anti-tumor effect and fewer side effects in vivo, which means it is a promising reagent for cancer therapy via intravenous administration. © 2011 Zheng et al.

79960496463	Effect of pyrroloquinoline quinone on morphology of cultured rat schwann cells and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen	To investigate the effects of pyrroloquinoline quinine (PQQ) on the morphology and proliferation of rat Schwann cells, and on the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in cultured rat Schwann cells. Methods: Schwann cells were obtained and cultured from sciatic nerves of 3-5 day SD rats in vitro, then were identified and purified by immunofluorescence against S-100. Cells of experimental group were treated with 100 nmol/L PQQ, control group were treated with PBS, and both groups were cultured for 48 hours to observe the morphology of Schwann cells and to count the cell number by inverted microscope. The expression of PCNA in Schwann cells treated with PQQ at different concentrations (0, 10, 50, 100, and 500 nmol/L) was determined by RT-PCR and Western blot. Results: PQQ with a concentration of 100 nmol/L could affect the cell morphology and increase the cell number (1.36 times, versus control). PQQ with concentrations ranged 10-500 nmol/L could increase the expression of PCNA mRNA and protein, and the PCNA expression reached the peak in 100 nmol/L PQQ treated Schwann cells (mRNA 2.0 times and protein 3.4 times, respectively, versus control). Conclusion: PQQ could increase the cell number of cultured Schwann cells, and up-regulate the expression of PCNA in cultured Schwann cells.

Most of the studies focused on micron fibers at present, however, there were little researches on PMIA nanofibers obtained by electrospinning. PMIA solution was prepared by putting it into the LiCl/DMAc solvent systems and subsequently heating it. Consequently the effect of temperatures on the solubility, the viscosity and conductivity were analysed. PMIA nanofiber mats were obtained by electrospinning. Morphologies and diameter distributions in different electrospinning processes were studied. The processing parameters included spinning solution concentration, voltage, collecting spinning distance (C-SD). Finally the optimized parameters were achieved as follows: dissolve temperature 90°C, spinning solution concentration 12wt%, high voltage 23 kv, C-SD 11 cm. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

80051933979	Dendritic poly(L-glutamic acid) based smart drug delivery system	A redox-sensitive drug delivery system was fabricated. Dendritic poly ( L-glutamic acid) was synthesized. Anti-tumor drug methotrexate (MTX) was immobilized on the dendritic poly ( L-glutamic acid) via disulfide bonds using cystines as linkers. The disulfide bond was sensitive to glutathione in intracellular environment, thus to release the MTX from the dendritic poly ( L-glutamic acid) backbones. The dendritic poly (L-glutamic acid) backbones and drug loaded conjugates were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) . The release profiles of the conjugates were investigated in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) with dithiothreitol ( DTT) to simulate the intracellular environment; the results showed that the release rates were closely dependant on the concentration of DTT. Higher DTT concentration resulted in faster release. When the DTT concentration was lower than 0.2 mmol/L, MTX was not released from dendritic backbones. The conjugates were incubated with HepG2 cells to evaluate their anti-tumor effect in vitro. The dendritic poly(L- glutamic acid) was nontoxic to cells even when its concentration was as high as 20 |xg/mL. The inhibition effect of the conjugates on tumor cells was better than that of free MTX after incubation for 72 h. Fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) was immobilized on the dendrmers and conjugates to trace the endocytosis. The MTX could promote the cell uptake for its folic acid mimetic structure.

80052030004	Carboxymethylated chitosan stimulates proliferation of Schwann cells in vitro via the activation of the ERK and Akt signaling pathways	Proliferation of Schwann cell in the injured peripheral nerve supports axonal regeneration and also is critical for the regeneration of injured nerves. In this publication, carboxymethylated chitosan (CMCS) was studied to determine its capacity (i) to induce proliferation and synthesis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and (ii) to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) and phosphatidylinositil- 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways in rat Schwann cells. CMCS was found to induce proliferation and PCNA synthesis in Schwann cells in a dose and time dependent manner. CMCS was shown to phosphorylate ERK1/2 and Akt in Schwann cell proliferation. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt in Schwann cells was blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. In addition, inhibition of the MEK/ERK or the PI3K/Akt signaling pathways significantly decreased the proliferative effects of CMCS in Schwann cells. Overall, the above results indicate that CMCS stimulates proliferation of Schwann cells by activating the intracellular signaling cascades of ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

80255139296	Synthesis of functionalizable and biodegradable polymers via ring-opening polymerization of 5-benzyloxy-trimethylene carbonate and ε-caprolactone	The biomedical applications of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) were limited for its high hydrophobicity and crystallinity. In this study, we copolymerized CL with amorphous 5-hydroxyl-trimethylene carbonate (HTMC) to solve the problem. The 5-benzyloxy-trimethylene carbonate (BTMC) was synthesized to copolymerize with CL, then hydrogenolyzed to obtain hydroxyl pendant groups. A serial of copolymers with different BTMC molar ratio were synthesized and their chemical structures and thermal properties were thoroughly studied with NMR, FT-IR, GPC, XRD, DSC, and TGA. Finally we examined the water contact angle of the copolymers. DSC and XRD results showed that the PCL segments in the copolymers crystallized below 16.8%. BTMC molar content and the crystallinity of the copolymers increased after hydrolysis. With the introduced hydroxyl pendant groups, the deprotected copolymers improved their hydrophilic property significantly, and the copolymer with 9.3% HTMC molar content had static water contact angle as low as 36.5°. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The surface patterns of the meshes were observed by SEM and the diameter distribution of the fibers was tested. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured on the electrospun fibers. The cell proliferations and migration of the patterns of aligned and random-oriented fibrous PLGA meshes were investigated. The results showed that the two surface patterns were favorable for cell adhesion and proliferation. The aligned fibers could guide the cells to migrate the fibrous direction. The aligned surface pattern was more efficient to accelerate the excretion of extracellular matrix. It provided a promising pattern technique to control the migration of cells. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

(PPDs) After lyopholization, the morphology, particle size, zeta potential, and the integrity of DNA in the NPs were investigated. The expression of mIL-18 gene on CT-26 cells in vitro were determined by western blot, while in vivo efficacy was evaluated by tumor inhibition rate, histological section, and survival curve in pulmonary metastasis of colon cancer in BALB/c mice model. Results showed that the cytotoxicity of blank nanoparticles was related to the degradation properties of the polymers with different compositions. The NPs with LA:GA = 70/30 (NPs-73) was optimal for intravenous injection due to its low cytotoxicity. Physicochemical properties of the PPDs were not changed during the lyopholization, while mIL-18 was successfully expressed in vitro. The anti-tumor efficacy in vivo of PPDs showed improvement especially combined with chemotherapy of cisplatin, and confirmed the promising application of the PPDs system, which compared with any single treatment. © The Author(s), 2010.

84862297533	Morphology and mechanical properties of MWNT/PMIA nanofibers by electrospinning	Multiwalled carbon nanotube/poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (MWNT/PMIA) nanofibers mats with different MWNT contents were successfully prepared by electrospinning. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and a thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA) were used to characterize the morphology and properties of nanofibers. The results showed that the nanofiber diameter is reduced with increasing MWNT concentrations and the surfaces of the MWNT/PMIA nanofibers becomes rough compared with those of the virgin version. The MWNTs are well dispersed in the nanofibers and well-aligned along the nanofibers. The dosing level of MWNTs seems to show only minor influences on both the crystalline structure and the initial degradation temperature of the nanofibers. While the mechanical properties of the nanofiber mats are generally improved with the addition of MWNTs. The striking improvement occurs at the loading of 0.6 wt% with the increase of tensile strength at breakage by ca. 86%. © The Author(s) 2012.

The hydrophobic and biocompatible molecule cholesterol was immobilized on the pendant functional group of PGA. The micelles were formed by the self-assemble driven by the hydrophilic-hydrophobic interaction. Anti-tumor drug doxorubicin was loaded in the micelles to study the drug release profile. The antitumor effects in vitro were evaluated with liver cancer cell HepG2. The results demonstrated that the content of cholesterol grafted was nearly the same as the feeding dose. The micelles of poly (glyceric acid)-g-cholesterol were formed in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and the critical micellization concentration was 63 μg/mL. The micelles were spherical with narrow size distribution; the average diameter was around 120 nanometers. The drug-loading rate and entrapment efficiency of the micelles with 5 mol% cholesterol content in the copolymer were 18. 71% and 46. 78%, respectively. The sustaining drug release time of the micelles was as long as 12 h. The study of cytotoxicity found that the micelle was nontoxic when the concentration was below 0. 5 mg/mL and it showed low cytotoxicity when the concentration was 1 mg/mL. The in vitro anti-tumor effect study showed that the drug loaded micelles could enter into the cancer cells by endocytosis, and the anti-tumor effect of the micelles was better than that of free doxorubicin.

The amphiphilic 7-carboxymethoxy coumarin monoend-functionalized methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG-Lys-DCOU) chains were self-assembled micelles. Anti-tumor drug doxorubicin was loaded in the mPEG-Lys-DCOU micelles and the release profile was studied. The cytotoxicity of mPEG-Lys-DCOU was evaluated by NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. The drug-loaded micelles were incubated with HepG2 tumor cells to investigate the in vitro anti-tumor effect. The in vivo inhibition efficacy of drug-loaded micelles was carried out on 4T1 breast cancer animal model. The results showed that both hydrophobic and π-π stacking interactions within mPEG-Lys-DCOU amphiphiles were contributed to the self-assembly. Both blank and drug loaded micelles were monodisperse nanoparticles with the average diameters around 300nm. The release profile exhibited certain pH dependence. The drug release rate at pH=5.5 was much faster than that at pH=7.4. mPEG-Lys-DCOU amphiphiles were non-toxic to NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the inhibition efficacy of drug-loaded micelles were comparable to that of doxorubicin hydrochloride. mPEG-Lys-DCOU micelles are promising carriers for anti-tumor drug delivery. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

84863651303	Synthesis and inhibition study on tripeptide inhibitor modified poly(l-lysine) dendrimers	Peptide dendrimers are attractive nonviral gene vectors. But a biological barrier for their application in gene delivery is the fast degradation catalyzed by proteasomes. Proteasome inhibitors are efficient at prohibiting the degradation of peptide nonviral vectors, thus enhancing gene transfection efficiency. In this study, Nα-Boc-protected leucine vinyl ester proteasome inhibitor Boc-Leu-Leu-Leu-ve was synthesized by the liquid-phase method and was then immobilized onto poly(l-lysine) dendrimers. Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC was used as fluorimetric substrate and the inhibition capacity of Boc-Leu-Leu-Leu-ve immobilized onto G3 and G6 poly(l-lysine) dendrimers for the chymotrypsin-like activity of ACHN cell proteasome was tested. The results indicated that both Boc-Leu-Leu-Leu-ve peptide and the peptide immobilized on G3 dendrimer showed low inhibition capacity when the concentration was below 0.2 μM. When the inhibitor concentrations were increased to 5.0μM, however, the percentage inhibition of Boc-Leu-Leu-Leu-ve peptide and the peptide immobilized on G3 dendrimer became about 50% and 25%, and that of peptide immobilized on the G6 dendrimer was 7.5% only. These results indicated that dendritic structure and linker length could be the main factors affecting proteasome inhibition capacity. The cytotoxicity of the dendritic inhibitors was found to be low. Thus, whilst the synthetic production of poly(l-lysine) dendrimers immobilized with peptide inhibitors was successful and these modified dendrimers could work to inhibit proteasome activity, further studies will need to be carried out to improve inhibition capacity. © The Author(s) 2010 Reprints and permissions.

84868120308	Cationic lipid-coated PEI/DNA polyplexes with improved efficiency and reduced cytotoxicity for gene delivery into mesenchymal stem cells	Background: Effective gene transfection without serum deprivation is a prerequisite for successful stem cell-based gene therapy. Polyethylenimine (PEI) is an efficient nonviral gene vector, but its application has been hindered by serum sensitivity and severe cytotoxicity. Methods: To solve this problem, a new family of lipopolyplexes was developed by coating PEI/DNA polyplexes with three serum-resistant cationic lipids, namely, lysinylated, histidylated, and arginylated cholesterol. The physical properties, transfection efficiency, cellular uptake, subcellular distribution, and cytotoxicity of the lipopolyplexes was investigated. Results: The outer coat composed of lysinylated or histidylated cholesterol remarkably improved the transfection efficiency of the polyplex with a low PEI/DNA ratio of 2 in the presence of serum. The resulting lysinylated and histidylated cholesterol lipopolyplexes were even more efficient than the best performing polyplex with a high PEI/DNA ratio of 10. Results from cellular uptake and subcellular distribution studies suggest that their higher transfection efficiency may result from accelerated DNA nuclear localization. The superiority of the lipopolyplexes over the best performing polyplex was also confirmed by delivering the therapeutic gene, hVEGF165. Equally importantly, the lipid coating removed the necessity of introducing excess free PEI chains into the transfection solution for higher efficiency, generating lipopolyplexes with no signs of cytotoxicity. Conclusion: Noncovalent modification of polyplexes with lysinylated and histidylated cholesterol lipids can simultaneously improve efficiency and reduce the toxicity of gene delivery under serum conditions, showing great promise for genetic modification of bone marrow stem cells. © 2012 Song et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84868203223	Novel PLGGE graft polymeric micelles for doxorubicin delivery	Novel poly{(lactic acid)-co-[(glycolic acid)-alt-(L-glutamic acid)]}-g-monomethyl poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGGE) micelles were prepared and used as carriers for anti-tumor drug delivery. Three PEGylated PLGG copolymers (PLGGE2000, PLGGE1100 and PLGGE500) were characterized by XRD, TG and DSC. The critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) of the amphiphilic copolymers were 1.04, 0.55 and 0.13 μg/mL, respectively. The TEM, AFM and DLS measurements revealed that the micelles were homogeneous spherical nanoparticles with the diameters ranged from 50 to 150 nm when THF was used as solvent in the preparation of the micelles. Interestingly, extended cylindrical micelles were obtained using CHCl3 as solvent. The micelles could trap doxorubicin (DOX) in the core with the highest drug loading content up to 23.7%. The mean diameter of drug loaded micelles was much bigger than that of blank micelles. The in vitro drug release of the micelles was diffusion-controlled release within the first 36 h and initial burst release was not obvious. However, after 36 h, the release rate in pH 5.0 was faster than that in pH 7.4 due to the degradation. The PLGGE micelles were nontoxic to both NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and HepG2 cells. The in vitro cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells demonstrated that the drug loaded micelles exhibited high inhibition activity to cancer cells. CLSM observation of HepG2 cells showed that DOX released from the micelles could be delivered into cell cytoplasm and cell nuclei. PLGGE micelles are potential promising carriers for anti-tumor drug delivery. © 2012 The Author(s).

84870484306	Cholesterol derivatives based charged liposomes for doxorubicin delivery: Preparation, in vitro and in vivo characterization	Cholesterol plays a critical role in liposome composition. It has great impact on the behavior of liposome in vitro and in vivo. In order to verify the possible effects from cholesterol charge, surface shielding and chemical nature, two catalogs of liposomes with charged and PEGylated cholesterols were synthesized. Anionic liposomes (AL) and cationic liposomes (CL) were prepared, with charges from hemisuccinate and lysine in cholesterol derivatives, respectively. Characteristics of different formulated liposomes were investigated after doxorubicin encapsulation, using neutral liposomes (NL) as control. Results showed that after PEGylation, AL and CL liposomes displayed prolonged retention release profile, while kept similar size distribution, encapsulation efficiency, low cytotoxicity and hemolysis comparing with NL. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry experiments confirmed the significantly higher cell uptake from AL and CL vesicles than the NL in mouse breast carcinoma and melanoma cells, human epithelial carcinoma and hepatoma cells. It was in accordance with our corresponding cellular mortality studies of DOX-loaded liposomes. The in vivo anti-tumor effect experiments from charged liposomes also presented much higher tumor inhibition effect (70% vs 45%, p < 0.05) than NL liposomes. This is the first time reporting anti-cancer effect from charged cholesterol liposome with/without PEGylation. It may give deeper understanding on the liposome formulation which is critical for liposome associated drug research and development. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

84870033334	Superparamagnetic nano-composite scaffolds for promoting bone cell proliferation and defect reparation without a magnetic field	Apart from chemical molecules, physical regulations also greatly determine the efficiency of healing in regenerating functional tissues. In this study, we fabricated superparamagnetic nano-composite scaffolds for tissue engineering and investigated their effects on different bone cells without an external magnetic field. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and hydrophobic superparamagnetic magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) were combined together with different mass ratios in order to construct composite scaffolds using an electrospinning method for the first time. The diameters of the fibers were 400-600 nm with the MNPs uniformly dispersed in them, as shown by transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy observations. All composite scaffolds retained superparamagnetism at room temperature, but the saturation magnetization did not increase linearly as the magnetite content increased. The composite scaffolds with different MNP content showed excellent biocompatibility and significantly promoted cell proliferation compared with PLGA nanofibrous scaffold without an external magnetic field. Cell cycle analysis proved that the composite scaffolds decreased cell numbers in G0/G1 phase while increasing those in S phase, which resulted in positive effects on cell proliferation. However, the composite scaffolds had no effect on the differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells because of the different impact mechanism between proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, the composite scaffolds composed of superparamagnetic MNPs could be considered as an ideal substrate for accelerating osteoblast cell proliferation and tissue repair. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84870309549	Polyethyleneimine/DNA polyplexes with reduction-sensitive hyaluronic acid derivatives shielding for targeted gene delivery	The natural anionic polysaccharide hyaluronic acid (HA) was modified by introducing reduction-sensitive disulfide bond between the carboxyl groups and the backbone of HA (HA-SS-COOH). HA-SS-COOH and its corresponding unmodified stable analog HA were used to shield DNA/PEI polyplexes (DP) to form ternary complexes (DPS and DPH complexes). The shielding/deshielding effect was tested along with size, zeta potential, cell viability and transfection. Both DPS and DPH complexes showed increase in size, decrease in zeta potential and low cytotoxicity in physiological conditions due to the anionic shielding. In the reductive environment, only HA-SS-COOH coated ternary complexes (DPS) demonstrated the size increase and recovered high positive zeta potential. DPS complexes showed an up to 14-fold higher transfection than the stable coated one, indicating the efficiency of the reduction-responsive deshielding design. Moreover, the presence of extra free HA inhibited the transfection of DPS on HepG2 and B16F10 cells with HA receptor expression, while displaying no effect on non-targeted NIH3T3 cells. More rapid cellular association of DPS with HepG2 was observed, thus confirming the targeting reservation of disulfide bond modified HA. Intratumoral injection of DPS complexes resulted in much higher accumulation and luciferase expression in the tumor bearing C57BL/6 mice. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated the successful combination of deshielding and target functions in HA derivatives for gene delivery. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84870326553	Supramolecular nanoparticles generated by the self-assembly of polyrotaxanes for antitumor drug delivery	A new approach of fabricating supramolecular nanoparticles generated by self-assembly polyrotaxanes for antitumor drug delivery has been reported. Cinnamic-acid-modified poly(ethylene glycol) chains were threaded in α-cyclodextrins to form polyrotaxanes. The polyrotaxanes self-assembled supramolecular nanoparticles. The morphology of the nanoparticles was changed from nanovesicle to micelle after the antitumor drug, doxorubicin, was loaded. The release profile of the drug-loaded nanoparticles was investigated, and it was found that the sustaining release time could last for 32 hours. The drug-loaded nanoparticles were co-cultured with mouse 4T1 breast cancer cells with a drug concentration of 10 μg/mL; the cell survival rate was 3.3% after a 72-hour incubation. In an in vivo study of breast cancer in a mouse model, the drug-loaded nanoparticles were injected in the tail veins of mice with a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight. The tumor inhibition rate of drug-loaded nanoparticles was 53%, which was better than that of doxorubicin hydrochloride. The cardiac toxicity of doxorubicin was decreased greatly after the encapsulation into supramolecular polyrotaxane nanoparticles. © 2012 Cárdenas et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

The morphology and biocompatibility of these self-assembled nanoparticles was investigated. Methods: Doxorubicin, an antitumor drug, was trapped in the nanoparticles to explore their drug-release behavior. The drug-loaded nanoparticles were incubated with HepG2 cells to evaluate their antitumor efficacy in vitro. The effects of poly(L-histidine) chain length on the properties, drug-release behavior, and antitumor efficiency of the nanoparticles were investigated. Results: The nanoparticles were pH-sensitive. The mean diameters of the two types of mPEG-PH-PLLA nanoparticle were less than 200 nm when the pH values were 5.0 and 7.4. The nanoparticles were nontoxic to NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and HepG2 cells.

84870714279	The potential of self-assembled, pH-responsive nanoparticles of mPEGylated peptide dendron-doxorubicin conjugates for cancer therapy	Nanoparticles, such as dendritic polymers, are currently investigated as excellent candidates for drug delivery vehicles. In this study, we report the preparation and characterization of mPEGylated peptide dendron-doxorubicin (dendron-DOX) conjugate based vehicle carrying 14.0 wt% (weight percent) of doxorubicin (DOX). Dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) studies demonstrated the dendron-DOX conjugate self-assembled into nanoscale particles with neutral charged surface. The globular morphology and compact nanoparticle with diameter around 80 nm were observed by SEM and TEM. The release rates of DOX from the nanoparticle at pH 5.0 were much faster than those at pH 7.4 due to the pH-sensitive cleavage of the hydrazone bonds. The nanoparticle was shown to effectively kill cancer cells in vitro. Importantly, the nanoparticle resulted in strong antitumor activity and induced apoptosis on the 4T1 breast tumor model. In vivo toxicity evaluation demonstrated that drug-free dendron and drug-loading nanoparticle provided good biosafety in healthy or tumor-bearing mice, because no significant systematic toxicity was revealed via histological analysis. The functionalized peptide dendron-DOX conjugate based nanoparticle may be therefore a potential candidate for drug delivery vehicle for cancer therapy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Novel polymeric micelles were developed for 9-NC delivery. The micelles were fabricated from the self-assembly of amphiphiles with cinnamic acid (CIN) as lipohilic moiety and methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) as hydrophilic segment. The micelles were nontoxic to NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. 9-NC was trapped efficiently in mPEG-DCIN micelles. The release of 9-NC from the micelles with one cinnamic acid molecule as lipophilic moiety (mPEG-CIN) was much faster than that from the micelles with two cinnamic acid molecules as lipophilic moiety (mPEG-DCIN). The in vitro anticancer inhibition study demonstrated that the anticancer activity of 9-NC loaded mPEG-DCIN micelles was much better than that of 9-NC loaded mPEG-CIN micelles. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

84875279747	Effect of carboxymethylated chitosan on the biosynthesis of NGF and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the proliferation of Schwann cells	The proliferation of Schwann cells around injured peripheral nerves supports the process of Wallerian degeneration and is critical for axonal regeneration. In this publication, carboxymethylated chitosan (CMCS) was studied to determine its capacity (i) to induce proliferation and secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) and (ii) to activate Wingless-type(Wnt) protein/β- catenin signaling pathways in rat Schwann cells. CMCS was found to induce Schwann cell proliferation and NGF synthesis in Schwann cell in a dose and time dependent manner. CMCS was shown to activate factors in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, including Dvl-1, β-catenin, Tcf4, Lef1, C-myc, and Cyclin D1 which are active in the proliferation of Schwann cells and biosynthesis of NGF of Schwann cell. Overall, this study suggests that CMCS can promote the proliferation of cultured Schwann cells and synthesis of NGF by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of the cross-linking on the resulted networks was studied. The results showed that the crosslinker had high reactivity and efficiency to form stable polymeric networks with high gel percentage, high decomposition temperature and good mechanical properties. These obtained networks were amorphous and elastic, and the glass transition temperatures were below physiological temperature (37 C), which were expected to be rubbery for in vivo applications. The properties of the networks could be predictably controlled and tailed by varying the polymer composition and cross-linker amount in feed.

Rat NSCs derived from fetal brain were divided into two groups, and cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10 % FBS and human CSF, respectively. Cellular growth was observed with an inverted microscope, and immunostaining was used to analyze differentiation of NSCs in both groups. Cells of fetal brain showed shapes of spindle or star with minor sprouts at fifth day post-culture, and stained with nestin. NSCs in the control group differentiated into neurons, with positive staining to NSE, when cultured further in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10 % FBS. While NSCs in the experiment group, cultured in CSF, differentiated into astroglia on eighth day, with positive immunostaining to GFAP. The new neurons dissolved rapidly when they were cultured in CSF. Human CSF cannot promote NSCs to differentiation toward neuron, nor support newborn neurons survival. It seems an inappropriate approach to transplant stem cells through CSF. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84877050745	Designer D-form self-assembling peptide nanofiber scaffolds for 3-dimensional cell cultures	Traditional 2-D cell cultures have many limitations because they do not truly mimic the natural environment. In order to fully understand the invivo 3-D environment, it is crucial to develop a biomimetic 3-D culture system. Recently progress toward 3-D tissue cell cultures has been gradually made by addressing many critical issues including the microenvironment, gradient diffusion and apoptosis. Here we report a D-form self-assembly peptide system that provides insight into the relationships between nanofiber scaffolds and cell behaviors in 3-D cell cultures. We observed the peptide secondary structures response to ions and confirmed that their participation increases mechanical force rapidly. We also showed the enzymes attachment to nanofibers, investigated scaffolds to form 3-D microenvironment and described a modified protocol for 3-D cell culture D-form self-assembly peptide. Using this protocol, we showed cell behavior in the D-form peptide with high cell viability and low-level cell apoptosis for weeks. Furthermore, we proposed a plausible model for chiral self-assembly peptides in 3-D culture. Our research may further stimulate others to design novel biological materials at single chiral amino acid level, and may broaden the applications of designer D-form self-assembling peptides in clinical and medical nanobiotechnology. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Multiple interactions such as hydrogen bonding, host-guest interaction, hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction have been utilized to generate the nanoparticles. Herein, a new polymeric amphiphile with methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) as hydrophilic block and π-π conjugated small molecule N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-L- phenylalanines (Fmoc-Phe-OH) instead of hydrophobic polymer chain as lipophilic segment was synthesized. Anti-tumor drug doxorubicin (DOX) was trapped in the self-assembly nanoparticles via the dual hydrophobic and π-π stacking interactions. The synthesis and morphology of the self-assembly nanoparticles were studied. The interactions between drug and carrier, release profile, cellular uptake and in vitro anti-tumor efficiency of the drug loaded nanoparticles were investigated in details. The results showed that the amphiphiles self-assembled into spindle nanoparticles with the size around 200 nanometers. The π-π stacking interaction between DOX and Fmoc-Phe-OH achieved great performance for the efficient drug encapsulation. The DOX could be sustaingly released for 50 hours. The drug loaded nanoparticles were internalized in HepG2 cancer cells efficiently and exhibited good anti-tumor activity in vitro. The nanoparticles generated by mPEG-Phe-Fmoc amphiphiles provided a new strategy to fabricate polymeric nanoparticles for anti-tumor drug delivery.

The amphiphiles with one or two cinnamic acid molecules as lipophilic architectures (mPEG-CIN and mPEG-Lys-DCIN) were synthesized. We expressly investigated the effect of the lipophilic parts on size, morphology and stability of the self-assembly micelles. Anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was trapped in the micelles and the interactions between the lipophilic moieties and DOX were studied. The anticancer activity of the DOX-loaded micelles was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The results revealed that mPEG-Lys-DCIN micelles exhibited better stability and higher drug loading content. Strong π-π stacking interaction was formed within the DOX-loaded micelles. The DOX released from mPEG-Lys-DCIN micelles was slower than that from mPEG-CIN micelles. DOX-loaded mPEG-Lys-DCIN micelles exhibit higher inhibition efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the in vivo experimental results demonstrated that the anticancer efficiency of DOX-loaded mPEG-Lys-DCIN micelles was comparable to that of free DOX, meanwhile, the side effect of DOX was reduced greatly after encapsulation. This novel strategy of fabricating polymeric micelles with π-π conjugated small molecules as lipophilic moieties could be serve as a universal prototype for drug delivery. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

The mean diameters of DOX loaded micelles were around 50-60 nm, which were much smaller than those of blank micelles (100-200 nm). Both the drug loading content and encapsulation efficiency of the micelles decreased with the sequence of the side group substitution of carboxyl, benzyl and imidazole. The release of DOX loaded micelles with imidazole groups was pH-dependent, and more than 90% of the loaded DOX could be released within 48 hours in a weak acidic medium (pH 5.0).

84891340367	Protective effect of tacrolimus postconditioning on oxidative stress injury provoked by spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion in rats	Objective: To investigate whether protective effect of tacrolimus postconditioning on rats' spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury is mediated by up-regulation of activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and down-regulation of production of oxygen free radicals. Methods: Ninety male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into ischemia-reperfusion (IR) group, tacrolimus postconditioning (TP) group and sham operation (SO) group. The model of spinal cord ischemia was prepared by means of catheterization through femoral artery and balloon dilatation. IR group underwent reperfusion 20 min after spinal cord ischemia. TP group experienced a single injection of tacrolimus (0.5 mg/kg) through the left common carotid artery at the onset of reperfusion. SO group received femoral artery catheterization only. Fluorospectrophotometry was employed to detect the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in injured spinal cord segment at 15 minutes after reperfusion. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and activity of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) were determined at 15 minutes, 1, 6, and 24 hours after reperfusion respectively. BBB scale was conducted to evaluate hindlimb motor function at 14 days after reperfusion. Results: The level of ROS in TP group was significantly lower than that in IR group at 15 minutes after reperfusion. The activity of SOD was significantly higher in TP group than in IR group at all observational time points, while the activities of CAT and GSH-PX were significantly higher in TP group than n IR group at 1 and 6 hours after reperfusion. The content of MDA in TP group was significantly less than that in IR group at all observational time points. The motor function score of TP group was significantly superior to that of IR group at 14 days after reperfusion. Conclusion: Tacrolimus postconditioningcan improve activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, decrease production of oxygen free radicals, suppress lipid peroxidation, and thereby promote functional recovery after spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.

Ninety male SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, ischemia-reperfusion group and tacrolimus postconditioning group. The model of spinal cord ischemia was established by means of catheterization through femoral artery and balloon dilatation. The spinal cord was reperfused 20 min after ischemia via removing saline out of balloon. The corresponding spinal cord segments were excised and determined for Akt activity in spinal cord tissue by using Western blotting at 5, 15, and 60 min after reperfusion respectively. Spinal cord tissue sections were stained immunohistochemically for detection of the phosphorylated Akt expression at 15 min after reperfusion. Flow cytometry was applied to assess apoptosis of neural cells, and dry-wet weights method was employed to measure water content in spinal cord tissue at 24 h after reperfusion. The results showed that the activities of Akt in tarcolimus postconditioning group were significantly higher than those in ischemia-reperfusion group at 5, 15, and 60 min after reperfusion (P<0.05, P<0.01). The Akt activities reached the peak at 15 min after reperfusion in ischemia-reperfusion group and tacrolimus postconditioning group. The percentage of apoptotic cells and water content in spinal cord tissue were significantly reduced (P<0.01) in tacrolimus postconditioning group as compared with those in ischemia-reperfusion group at 24 h after reperfusion. It is concluded that tacrolimus post-conditioning can increase Akt activity in spinal cord tissue of rats, inhibit apoptosis of neural cells as well as tissue edema, and thereby alleviate spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury. © 2013 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

In this paper, we designed and synthesized the amphiphilic tripeptides through solution phase synthesis. The tripeptides were purified by column chromatography and the molecular structures were confirmed by 1H NMR and TOF-MS. The tripeptides could self-assemble into spherical nanoparticles in aqueous media with a low critical aggregation concentration. The size and morphology of the nanoparticles were performed by dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscope. The peptide-based nanoparticles were used as biocompatible nanocarriers for encapsulating hydrophobic doxorubicin (DOX) to achieve controlled release. The CCK-8 assay indicated that the peptide-based nanocarriers could enhance cellular uptake and drug efficacy of DOX to A549 tumor cell line.

The drug release of micelles in pH 5.5 was much faster than that in pH 7.4. The confocal laser microscopy and flow cytometry measurements indicated that the weak acidity of endosomes broke the citraconic amide bonds in the copolymer backbones and triggered the fast release of DOX.

84902437698	Molecular self-assembly guides the fabrication of peptide nanofiber scaffolds for nerve repair	Peptide nanostructures formed through molecular self-assembly are increasingly important for material science and regenerative medicine. Peptide self-assembly allows the design and fabrication of supramolecular architectures at the nanoscale. In the β-sheet system, ionic self-complementary peptides and peptide amphiphiles (PAs) have been extensively developed to form cylindrical nanofibers and subsequent 3D biomaterial scaffolds, which have demonstrated the potential to repair nerves. In addition, modification with peptide epitopes (i.e. functional motifs) and incorporation of molecular signals are beneficial to the bioactivity of peptide nanofiber scaffolds, and these two methods contribute favorably to the improvement of cell function and tissue regeneration in neural tissue engineering. This review focuses on the design, fabrication and properties of these two peptide-based biomaterial scaffolds, as well as their application in nerve repair. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

84901987518	Functional and biodegradable dendritic macromolecules with controlled architectures as nontoxic and efficient nanoscale gene vectors	Gene therapy has provided great potential to revolutionize the treatment of many diseases. This therapy is strongly relied on whether a delivery vector efficiently and safely directs the therapeutic genes into the target tissue/cells. Nonviral gene delivery vectors have been emerging as a realistic alternative to the use of viral analogs with the potential of a clinically relevant output. Dendritic polymers were employed as nonviral vectors due to their branched and layered architectures, globular shape and multivalent groups on their surface, showing promise in gene delivery. In the present review, we try to bring out the recent trend of studies on functional and biodegradable dendritic polymers as nontoxic and efficient gene delivery vectors. By regulating dendritic polymer design and preparation, together with recent progress in the design of biodegradable polymers, it is possible to precisely manipulate their architectures, molecular weight and chemical composition, resulting in predictable tuning of their biocompatibility as well as gene transfection activities. The multifunctional and biodegradable dendritic polymers possessing the desirable characteristics are expected to overcome extra- and intracellular obstacles, and as efficient and nontoxic gene delivery vectors to move into the clinical arena. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84904255451	Nanoparticles generated by PEG-Chrysin conjugates for efficient anticancer drug delivery	Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems promise the safety and efficacy of anticancer drugs. Herein, we presented a facile approach to fabricate novel nanoparticles generated by PEG-Chrysin conjugates for the delivery of anticancer drug doxorubicin. Chrysin was immobilized on the terminal group of methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) to form mPEG-Chrysin conjugate. The conjugates were self-assembled into nanoparticles. Doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded in the nanoparticles. The self-assembly, drug release profiles, interactions between nanoparticle and drug, cellular uptake and in vitro anticancer activity of the DOX loaded nanoparticles were investigated. The results showed that the mean diameters of drug loaded nanoparticles were below 200 nm. Strong π-π stacking interaction was tested within the drug loaded nanoparticles. The drug release rate was closely related to the chain length of PEG, shorter PEG chain resulted faster release. The mPEG-Chrysin conjugate was non-toxic to both 3T3 fibroblasts and HepG2 cancer cells. The cellular uptake measurements demonstrated that the mPEG

84904291043	Optically transparent PMMA composite reinforced with PA-6 nanofibers	Nanofibers possess great potential in realizing optically transparent composites with improved mechanical performance without compromising transparency. While having reinforcing nanofibers with diameters thinner than 400 nm (the lower end of the visible light spectrum) is critical in principle, poor distribution of these nanofibers within the PMMA matrix would also affect the transparency of the resultant composite. A new method based on self-blending co-electrospinning was proposed to prepare electrospun meshes of PA-6 nanofibers well-mingled with PMMA fibers, from which composite films and/or panels with varied mass fractions of PA-6 nanofibers can be fabricated through hot-press technique. Preliminary mechanical evaluation in terms of tensile properties of the PA-6/PMMA composite was found to be remarkably improved without apparent influence on its transparency if the PA-6 loading fraction was lower than 5%.

84908676301	Designer functionalised self-assembling peptide nanofibre scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering	Owing to the limited regenerative capacity of cartilage tissue, cartilage repair remains a challenge in clinical treatment. Tissue engineering has emerged as a promising and important approach to repair cartilage defects. It is well known that material scaffolds are regarded as a fundamental element of tissue engineering. Novel biomaterial scaffolds formed by self-assembling peptides consist of nanofibre networks highly resembling natural extracellular matrices, and their fabrication is based on the principle of molecular self-assembly. Indeed, peptide nanofibre scaffolds have obtained much progress in repairing various damaged tissues (e.g. cartilage, bone, nerve, heart and blood vessel). This review outlines the rational design of peptide nanofibre scaffolds and their potential in cartilage tissue engineering.

84912101153	Correlation of polymeric micelle sizes and their cellular internalization in vitro and tumor targeting in vivo	In order to explore the size effect of polymeric micelles on cellular internalization and tumor targeting, chrysin modified mPEG-PCL copolymer micelles with different particle sizes were fabricated to load Nile red as fluorescence probes. Four kinds of micelles with the mean sizes of 20, 40, 80 and 120 nm and narrow size distributions were prepared. The zeta potentials of the micelles were within -2 to 0 mV. The micelles were stable at low concentration (10<sup>-3</sup> mg mL<sup>-1</sup>) for a long time of storage. The micelles were incubated with C2C12 myoblasts and 4T1 breast cancer cells to investigate their cellular uptake. It was found that the cellular internalization of the polymeric micelles was dependent on the cell line and particle size. The cellular uptake of the micelles in 4T1 cells was much better than that in C2C12 cells, and the polymeric micelles with a size of 120 nm exhibited the strongest red fluorescence. The Nile red loaded polymeric micelles were injected in mice via their tail vein to study tumor targeting in vivo. The micelles were mainly accumulated in the liver and kidney, however, different from the results in vitro, the red fluorescence intensity in the tumor administrated with polymeric micelles with a size of 40 nm was the strongest compared with the other three particles, which implied that micelles with a size of 40 nm exhibited efficient tumor targeting. This work provides guidelines for the rational design of polymeric micelles as carriers for efficient targeted drug delivery. This journal is

0346985504	An Evaluation of Adenosine Triphosphate Bioluminescence Assay for Tumor in vitro Chemosensitivity Testing	This study was aimed at the feasibility of using ATP-bioluminescence assay for tumor in vitro chemosensitivity testing. With the use of this assay, the authors determined dose-response curve in mouse fibroma cell line L929 treated with chemotherapeutic agents, and investigated the different in vitro responses of 6 ovarian carcinomas (5 from fresh tumor tissues, 1 from ascites) treated with etopside, cis-plating, 5-fluorouracil and adriamycin. The results showed that the coefficients of variation for triplicate assays ranged from 1.2% to 15. 8% which means high reproducibility of the assay. The single cell suspension (including <30 cells clusters) could be separated from tissue fragments by means of enzyme cocktail (collagenase, Dnase, pronase). The viable cells were over 90%. This study demonstrates that ATP-bioluminescence assay is a sensitive, reliable and efficient method for tumor chemosensitivity testing. In this connection, the correlation between in vitro drug sensitivity and in vivo patient response is worth further studying.

12344274592	Effective activation of the chiral salen/Ti(OiPr)4 catalyst with achiral phenolic N-oxides as additives in the enantioselective cyanosilylation of ketones	The activation of chiral titanium(IV) complexes with phenolic N-oxides additives has been found to provide an alternative strategy for the asymmetric cyanosilylation of ketones. By using 10 mol % of chiral salen-titanium(IV) complex in combination with 1 mol % achiral phenolic N-oxide as an additive, aromatic, aliphatic and heterocyclic ketones have been converted into the corresponding cyanohydrin trimethylsilyl ethers in 58-96% yields with 56-82% ee. Several factors concerning the reactivity and enantioselectivity have been discussed. A catalytic cycle based on experimental phenomena and studies has been proposed to explain the origin of this activation and the asymmetric induction. © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
