17944367539	Recognition of mature fruit in natural scene using computer vision	A recognition technique of mature fruit in natural scenes was researched in this paper. First, several color models of HSI system were compared including sphere, cylinder and double cone model etc. The sphere model was selected because of lesser erratic data than others in this research work. The color image was translated from RGB system to HSI system, and the hue, lightness and saturation images were acquired. In order to eliminate the influence of background of soil and sky, the hue and saturation data was combined and produced fusion image. The fusion image was segmented by Otsu operation. As the blasted leaves and other background had similar color as mature fruit, several shape features were extracted to segment object from background. The segmentation result showed this method had a very good effect.

A planar calibration rig was made as sample, and the equivalent center of circles in the rig was taken as reference point to avoid unnecessary measuring error. To get the precise camera parameters, the linear and nonlinear methods were combined. First, Direct Linear Transform (DLT) model was used to get the projection matrix. Then the matrix was decomposed based on the restraint condition, and the intrinsic parameters of camera was estimated. These estimates were fed to the non-linear optimizer as initial guess for the calibration parameters; the Levenberg-Marquardt method was used as non-linear optimizer. The experiment indicates that the calibrated parameters have certain differences from instructions, but completely agree with the actual condition.

84876742194	On-line estimation of eggshell strength based on acoustic impulse response analysis	This paper proposes a nondestructive method for on-line estimation of eggshell strength based on acoustic resonance analysis. The system employed digital signal processing (DSP, TMS320F2812) as core processor to collect and analyze the response signal of eggshell. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) were used to transform the time domain signal into frequency domain signal for next analysis. Synergy interval partial least square (si-PLS) combined with multiple stepwise regression was used to establish a linear calibration model for eggshell strength measurement. The performance of the optimal model using 11 frequency variables was achieved, with R (correlation coefficient) of 0.776 and RMSEP (root mean square error of prediction) of 3.010 in prediction set. Good consistence confirmed that the acoustic resonance system has significant potential in on-line estimation of the eggshell strength. Industrial relevance With processing and handling procedure continues increasing in egg production, the possibility of the presence of eggshell crack sharply increases. In such case, it is essential to measure the strength of eggshell, so as to maintain the balance between eggshell strength and the handling load in the processing of egg collection, sorting and transportation. This work proposes a nondestructive method for on-line estimation of eggshell strength based on acoustic resonance analysis, and builds a robust calibration model to improve the prediction ability. The research data presents a potential way for on-line and non-destructive measurement of eggshell strength in egg industry. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rapid model reconstruction for fruit tree was researched: firstly, each branch module was constructed by 12-prism in the coordinate origin; then, every module was set to the correct posture by affine transformation; finally, the complete fruit tree model was restructured. Experiments show that the virtual trees provide the actual environment reference for obstacle avoidance and path planning of fruit picking machine.

84862785082	Simultaneous Measurement of Total Acid Content and Soluble Salt-free Solids Content in Chinese Vinegar Using Near-infrared Spectroscopy	Total acid content (TAC) and soluble salt-free solids content (SSFSC) in Chinese vinegar are 2 important indicators in the assessment of its quality. This paper shows the feasibility to determine TAC and SSFSC in Chinese vinegar by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Synergy interval partial least square (Si-PLS) algorithm was performed to calibrate the regression model. The number of PLS factors and the number of intervals were optimized simultaneously by cross-validation. The performance of the model was evaluated according to root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and correlation coefficient (R) in the prediction set. The optimum Si-PLS model for TAC was achieved with RMSEP= 0.264 g/100 mL and R

84863886618	Rapid measurement of total acid content (TAC) in vinegar using near infrared spectroscopy based on efficient variables selection algorithm and nonlinear regression tools	Total acid content (TAC) is an important index in assessing vinegar quality. This work attempted to determine TAC in vinegar using near infrared spectroscopy. We systematically studied variable selection and nonlinear regression in calibrating regression models. First, the efficient spectra intervals were selected by synergy interval PLS (Si-PLS); then, two nonlinear regression tools, which were extreme learning machine (ELM) and back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), were attempted. Experiments showed that the model based on ELM and Si-PLS (Si-ELM) was superior to others, and the optimum results were achieved as follows: the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.2486 g/100 mL, and the correlation coefficient (R

84872348495	On-line detection of eggshell crack based on acoustic resonance analysis	An on-line system based on acoustic resonance was developed for eggshell crack detection. The system employed digital signal processing (DSP) as core processor to collect and analyze the response signal of shell eggs. The effects of excitation point, speed of the conveying system, impact intensity and egg mass on the frequencies response signals were investigated. Based on previous experiments, differences between the signals of intact eggs and cracked eggs were analyzed. Five excited resonance frequency characteristics expressing the differences between intact and cracked eggs were explored as input vectors. A simple and robust calibration model was built to discriminate intact and cracked eggs, while meeting speed requirement of on-line measurement. The identification rates for intact and cracked eggs were 100% and 96.1% respectively. It is concluded that the system has significant potential in the on-line detection of cracked eggs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84879548666	Determination of Chinese Angelica honey adulterated with rice syrup by an electrochemical sensor and chemometrics	A facile electrochemical sensor strategy coupled with a chemometric method was developed to analyze Chinese Angelica honey samples adulterated with rice syrup based on the decrease of natural antioxidants in the honey. The cyclic voltammogram of the honey sample changed obviously when it was blended with an amount of rice syrup. Then twelve variable features were extracted from the electrochemical signals in cyclic voltammetry unprecedentedly. The variables representing current and quantity of electricity played an important role in discriminate analysis after being processed by principal component analysis (PCA). Principal component analysis linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) and LDA models showed good performance in identifying pure honey and adulterated honey with the recognition rates both achieving 100%. Finally, in quantitative analysis of honey adulteration, the multiple linear regression (MLR) model fitted exactly and predicted well with R

84881001533	Real-time citrus recognition and location based on TOF imaging technology	The intensity and depth information of reflected light were represented with image based on the analysis of TOF (time of flight) imaging technology. A new adaptive filter model coupling with partial differential equations filter and shock filter was established to remove noise and to sharpen edges efficiently. The algorithms of thresholding, region growing and smallest surrounding circle were used to segment mature citrus from the background. Depth range and variance within the selected region and radius of recognized citrus were calculated and used as constraint condition for further selecting of recognized citrus regions. Three-dimensional database was integrated with extracted characteristic parameters of recognized citrus to realize real-time recognition and location. The total classification results show that recognition accuracy of about 86.7% can be obtained without false detection. The error of depth information is less than 12 mm with actual radius of citrus less than 13 mm. It takes less than 100 ms for image recognition and location.

84883775095	Simplification of NIR model for citrus's sugar content based on sensory methods	The prediction of sugar content (SC) in citrus by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and sensory test was investigated the validation whether the result of non-destructive determination methods by NIRS can meet the request of consumers' sensory or not, and the simplification of the prediction model of NIRS for citrus's SC with variables selection on the basis of meeting their demands. Result of the latter analyzed by one-way ANOVA shows that there was a significant difference influenced by individual diversity, but not by gender. After excluding the sensuous outliers, root mean standard error of deviation (RMSED) of every participator was calculated and the minimum equaled to 0.633, which was chosen as borderline of NIR model's RMSEP to meet the sensory request. Then, combined with spectral preprocessing and variables selection methods, SPA-MLR model was obtained by its robustness with R

84899631837	Identification of fruit and branch in natural scenes for citrus harvesting robot using machine vision and support vector machine	With the decrease of agricultural labor and the increase of production cost, the researches on citrus harvesting robot (CHR) have received more and more attention in recent years. For the success of robotic harvesting and the safety of robot, the identification of mature citrus fruit and obstacle is the priority of robotic harvesting. In this work, a machine vision system, which consisted of a color CCD camera and a computer, was developed to achieve these tasks. Images of citrus trees were captured under sunny and cloudy conditions. Due to varying degrees of lightness and position randomness of fruits and branches, red, green, and blue values of objects in these images are changed dramatically. The traditional threshold segmentation is not efficient to solve these problems. Multi-class support vector machine (SVM), which succeeds by morphological operation, was used to simultaneously segment the fruits and branches in this study. The recognition rate of citrus fruit was 92.4%, and the branch of which diameter was more than 5 pixels, could be recognized. The results showed that the algorithm could be used to detect the fruits and branches for CHR.

84901623773	Preparation of carbaryl-imprinted capillary monolithic column for screening of carbaryl from three carbamates mixture	A carbaryl molecularly imprinted capillary monolith was prepared by organic-inorganic hybrid approach. Methacrylic acid (MAA) as functional monomer, γ-methacryloxypropytrimethoxysilane (γ-MAPS) as crosslinker, carbaryl as template molecule, and acetonitrile/dichloromethane mixture (v/v, 1:4) were used as porogen. The molar ratio of 1:6:8 (carbaryl:MAA: γ-MAPS, for which the retention factor k was 7. 57, was expected to be highest for carbaryl on the optimum capillary monolith. The condition of 20 mmol/L phosphate buffer with pH value 3. 5 containing 30% acetonitrile favored the carbaryl separation from three carbamates (carbaryl, fenobucarb and metocarb) through the effective imprinted length of the column which was 15 cm. As far as the screening of carbaryl from a group of structural analogs, the MIP monolith combined with capillary electrochromatography was preferred. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84902147756	A sensitive amperometric acetylcholine biosensor based on carbon nanosphere and acetylcholinesterase modified electrode for detection of pesticide residues	A sensitive biosensor based on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and carbon nanosphere (CNS) immobilized on a glassy carbon electrode was developed for the detection of pesticides by the inhibition of AChE activity. The inhibition effect of the pesticides resulted in a decrease of current response of the acetylthiocholine chloride that was used as a substrate to obtain an electrochemical signal. When applied to the pesticides carbofuran and fenitrothion, the designed biosensor exhibited high sensitivity and low detection limits. The inhibition ratio of carbofuran and fenitrothion were linearly proportional to their concentrations ranging from 0.40 to 4.79 and 6.26 to 125.31 μg/L, respectively. The theoretical detection limits were found to be 0.082 μg/L for carbofuran and 2.61 μg/L for fenitrothion. Furthermore, as the biosensor offers good reproducibility and stability, it could be used for trace detection of pesticides in real samples. Compared with other AChE biosensors, the proposed biosensor was convenient and it exhibited extreme sensitivity to pesticides. © 2014 The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.

84906683237	Nondestructive gender identification of silkworm cocoons using X-ray imaging with multivariate data analysis	A rapid, reliable and nondestructive method for the gender discrimination of silkworm cocoons is of great importance for the production of high-quality silk by the mulberry silkworm industry. This study aimed to determine the feasibility of using soft X-ray imaging with multivariate data analysis to discriminate the gender of silkworm cocoons. X-ray images of silkworm cocoons were obtained and preprocessed and then the region of interest of the chrysalises was segmented. In total, 11 morphological characters of the chrysalises were extracted and compressed by principal component analysis to visualize cluster trends. In developing the discrimination classifiers, four different types of algorithm, including the K nearest neighbors, linear discriminant analysis, back propagation artificial neural network and support vector machine algorithms, were used comparatively; the performances of these models were optimized by cross-validation. The results indicate that the correct identification rates of these classifiers were all high and ranged from 92.57% (obtained via the support vector machine algorithm) to 93.68% (obtained via the K nearest neighbor algorithm). With respect to the running time, the linear discriminant analysis classifier had the best accuracy of 93.31%. These results indicate that this X-ray imaging technique with multivariate analysis could be used successfully for the screening of the gender of silkworm cocoons in the mulberry silkworm industry. © the Partner Organisations 2014.

84906113610	Egg Freshness on-Line Estimation Using Machine Vision and Dynamic Weighing	This paper proposed a non-destructive method for online estimation of egg freshness based on machine vision and dynamic weighing. The machine vision system and the dynamic weighing system were developed for the measurement of egg external physical characteristic and weight. Digital signal processing was employed to denoise, analyze, and extract the effective feature information from the images and vibration signals. Then, the method of multiple linear regressions was used to build model for Haugh unit prediction using the parameters of long axis, minor axis, and weight. The performance of the predictive model using six variables was achieved, with R (correlation coefficient) of 0.8653 and RMSEP (root mean square error of prediction) of 3.7454 in prediction set. The speed of the system reaches four eggs per second for every measurement. Good consistence confirmed that the proposed method has a significant potential application in online estimation of the egg freshness. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.
