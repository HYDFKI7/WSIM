30044445596	Analysis of essential oils from flower-buds, leaves and stems of Filipendula palmata(Pall.) Maxim.	The essential oils of the flower-buds, leaves and stems of Filipendula palmata(Pall.) Maxim, were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Thirty-three, forty-seven and forty-seven compounds in the flower-buds, leaves and stems were identified, respectively. Methyl salicylate exists in a great amount which is up to 70.10% in the flower-buds. Its amount is also high in other two parts. The data obtained show that it may be one of the main natural mosquito-expelling and pain-alleviating components in the three parts. The flower-buds are the main active part with the mosquito-expelling function.

33645798061	A method for high-quality RNA extraction from Panax ginseng plant tissues	Extraction of high-quality RNA from Panax ginseng tissues is particularly difficult due to high levels of polyphenolics and polysaccharides, or other compounds that bind and/or coprecipitate with RNA. The methods such as guanidinum thiocyanate, CTAB and modified Trizol were applied to isolate high purity and integrity RNA from Panax ginseng. By all of these methods total RNA can be obtained, but only by the modified Trizol method, it extracts integrity and undegraded RNA from mature leaf tissue. Following this efficient procedure, 90 ∼ 120 μg/g total RNA from leaf tissues can be obtained. The ratio of intensities of the 28 S and 18 S rRNA bands was 2:1. The absorbance ratios (A

33646349733	Synergistic effects of activin A and fibroblast growth factor 2 in the modulation of insulin expression	Diabetes is the most prevalent and serious metabolic disease, and the number of diabetic patients worldwide is increasing. The reduction of insulin biosynthes is in pancreatic β-cells is closely associated with the onset and progression of diabetes, therefore, it is important to search for ways to induce insulin-producing cells in non-β-cells. In the present study, it has been reported that activin A and a basic fibroblast growth factor 2(FGF2), can synergistically increase the insulin mRNA level, in both mouse E14 striatal primary cell cultures and the hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22. Activin A and FGF2 can jointly stimulate the nuclear translocation of Smad3 and specifically activate ERK1/2. It is interesting to note that a specific inhibitor for MEK, U0126, can efficiently block the induction of an insulin promoter activity by activin A and FGF2. This indicates that activin A collaborates with FGF2, giving a signal to induce the insulin gene through selective activation of the ERK-type MAP kinase and Smad3 in mouse striatal and HT22 cells. These data suggest that activin A may act in concert with FGF2 for the development of insulin -positive neurons.

33646355946	Isolation and characterization of proteins interacting with activin type II receptors	Regulation of the number of activin receptors that are present in the cell membrane plays a key role in the modulation of cellular responses to activin. In order to find the regulators, a novel protein ARIPzip, interacting with activin type II receptors, was searched and identified by using yeast two-hybrid screening. ARIPzip is a splicing variant of ARIP2. This has been discussed previously. ARIPzip can specifically interact with ActR IIA, and is widely distributed in mouse tissues. Overexpression of ARIPzip can cause the activin-induced transcriptional activities to increase in a dose-dependent manner while the overexpression of ARIP2 can decrease these activities. These data suggest that the C-terminal regions of ARIP2 and ARIPzip are involved in the regulation of activin signaling.

33746494614	Preparation of polyclonal antibodies against testis-specific protease 50 and characterization of antibody specificity	Testis-specific protease 50 (TSP50) is a testis-specific oncogene, which is abnormally activated in most tested patients with breast cancer. This property makes it an attractive molecular marker and a promising target for the diagnosis and therapy of breast cancer. In order to obtain the protective and specific polyclonal antibodies for further research, TSP50 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from normal human testicular tissue, and inserted into eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1. Rabbit anti-TSP50 polyclonal antibodies were prepared by means of intramuscular injection of pcDNA3.1-TSP50 into the rabbits. Titers of the anti-sera were measured by ELISA and Western blotting with the E. coli cell lysate containing the induced GST-TSP50 fusion protein as an antigen. In addition, we examined the expression of TSP50 in both breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and breast cancer tissue by immunofluorescent and immunohistochemistry analysis.

33746538552	Components of essential oils in different parts of Daucus carota L. var. sativa Hoffm	The components of the essential oils obtained from different parts of Daucus carota L var. sativa Hoffm were analyzed. The percentages of the essential oils extracted are 0.27% (ml/100 g material) for the flowers, 0.07% for the stems and leaves and 0.01% for the roots. Fifty-four, Sixty-six and Thirty-three compounds were, respectively, separated and identified from the flowers, the stems and leaves and the roots, among which unsaturated alkene compounds are thirty-nine, thirty-nine and twenty-one, respectively, accounting in turn for up to 90.21%, 90.49% and 72.65% of the total essential oils. Because alkene compounds have double bonds that are easily oxidized, it can be inferred that the components of the essential oils in the different parts of Daucus carota L. var. sativa Hoffm should show an activity of the anti-formation of free radicals to some extent.

33747132957	Screening of single-chain variable fragments against TSP50 from a phage display antibody library and their expression as soluble proteins	A novel gene, testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50), is abnormally activated and differentially expressed in most patients with breast cancer, suggesting it as a novel biomarker for this disease. The possibility that TSP50 may be an oncogene is presently under investigation. In this study, the single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) against TSP50 were panned from a phage display antibody library using TSP50-specific peptide, pep-50, as a target antigen. After 4 rounds of panning, 3 clones (A1, A11, and C8) from the library were verified to show strong binding affinities for TSP50 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and to contain the variable region genes of the light and heavy chains of scFv antibodies but different complementary determining regions by sequencing. The genes of scFv-A1 and scFv-A11 were cloned into expression vector pPELB and successfully expressed as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli Rosetta. The yields of expressions were about 4.0 to 5.0 mg of protein from 1 L of culture. The expressed proteins were purified by a 2-step procedure consisting of ion-exchange chromatography, followed by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The purified proteins were shown a single band at the position of 31 KDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sandwich ELISA demonstrated that the expressed scFv proteins were able to specifically react with pep-50, laying a foundation for the investigation of the function of TSP50 in the development and treatment of breast cancer. © 2006 Society for Biomolecular Sciences.

33750593109	A simple and fast experimental model of myocardial infarction in the mouse	In this report, we describe a simple and fast method for creating a murine myocardial infarction model and providing a useful and convenient tool for the research in ischemic heart disease. We established acute myocardial infarction in the Kunming-strain mouse within 2 minutes by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. The model was evaluated by observing the changes in histology and in the serum levels of aspartate amino-transferase and lactate dehydrogenase. Obvious myocardial necrosis was found in the 24-hr experimental (ligation) group. The average size of the infarction was 44.3% ± 2.9% of the left ventricle. Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase reached their peak in the 24-hr experimental group and were normal in the 72-hr experimental group. We set forth a simple and quick method for producing acute myocardial infarction experimentally in the mouse. The model can be reproduced in a stable manner, under experimental conditions that are easy to duplicate. © 2006 by the Texas Heart® Institute.

Time De pended Density Function Theory (TD-DFT) B3LYP and semi-empirical ZINDO method were employed to claculated electronic structure and spectrum properties of tectorigenin and tectoridin. It was found that the main absorption spectra originate from the π→π* electronic transition among the molecules orbitals. The change on the molecular structure can affect the distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the titled compounds and change absorption spectra property, and make UV spectra red shift to withdrawing electronic group.

The working mass fraction of chitosan was 1%. Morphologies of chitosan microparticles were affected by concentration of TPP, lower concentration of TPP (200 μg/mL) made the microparticle solution give sediment overnight, Whereas, higher concentration of TPP (800 μg/mL) made microparticles gather together. The release of vaccine from chitosan microparticles decreased when cross-linking ratio increased. The pH of chitosan solution had no effect on morphologies and release behavior. The results indicate that pH = 5.6, cross-linking ratio 1:3, mass concentration of TPP 400 μg/mL are the optimum conditions to prepare influenzal vaccine chitosan microparticles via morphologies and release behavior.

Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) provides a means for rapid and nondestructive characterization of the three-dimensional fiber architecture of myocardium. DTI studies were performed on 10 excised, formalin-fixed hearts of both Infarct (two months after left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion surgery, n = 4) and control (n = 6) porcine. Each slice was divided into eight segments, and fractional anisotropy (FA) value and helix angle were measured in multiples short-axis slices, respectively. Infarct myocardium exhibited decreased FA value, flatter helix angle courses fluctuating around small helix angle with greater standard error of the mean (SEM) and smaller range of helix angle.

45149095062	Identification and characterization of the human testes-specific protease 50 gene promoter	Testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50) has been identified as one of the testis-specific proteins that is expressed at high levels in approximately 92% of human breast cancer samples, making it an attractive molecular marker and a potential target for diagnosis and therapy. However, little is known about the transcriptional mechanisms controlling TSP50 gene expression. In the present study, we have characterized the 5′ regulatory region of the TSP50 gene in order to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating its expression. Analysis with a series of deletions demonstrated that a 624-bp region was essential for the basal promoter activity of the TSP50 gene. Further analysis results indicated that the two fragment regions +231 to +251 and -22 to -8, especially the putative Sp1 binding site (+237 to +239) and the putative CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) binding site (-15 to -13), are more important for the basal transcription activity of the human TSP50 promoter. Overexpression of Sp1 and C/EBPβ transcriptional factors upregulated the activities of the TSP50 promoter. Taken together, these results will help to better understand the role of the TSP50 gene in signal-dependent transcriptional regulation, and to develop new reagents for therapeutic downregulation of the TSP50 gene in human breast cancer. © Copyright 2008, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

65049084765	Identification and characterization of human ARIP2 and its relation to breast cancer	Activin, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Activin interacts with its type I and type II receptors to induce phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules known as Smads. Previous studies showed that mouse ARIP2 can reduce activin signaling by interacting with activin type II receptors (ActRIIs); however, the activity of ARIP2 in breast cancer is still unclear. In this study, we used RT-PCR to obtain a human homologue of mouse ARIP2, human activin receptor-interacting protein 2 (hARIP2). Like murine ARIP2, hARIP2 has a PDZ domain in its NH2-terminal region and can interact specifically with ActRIIs. Overexpression of hARIP2 reduced activin-induced transcriptional activity and enhanced cell proliferation and colony formation in human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells. However, down-regulation of hARIP2 expression by RNAi enhanced activin-induced transcriptional activity and reduced cell proliferation and colony formation. Immunohistochemistry revealed that hARIP2 was expressed more frequently and much more intensely in malignant breast tissues such as simple carcinoma, invasive ductal carcinoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma than in benign hyperplasia or fibroadenoma cases. These results suggest that hARIP2 is a putative growth-promoting factor involved in breast tumorigenesis and tumor development. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ten random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers yielded 106 bands, of which 94 were poly-morphic; 80 out of the 84 bands produced by nine inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers were polymorphic. Contents of water-soluble constituents of mycelia were characterized by high-performance liquid-chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) analyses. Cluster analyses of the genetic and phytochemical variation revealed that Armillaria mellea exhibited four chemo-types and four clusters from phytochemical contents. Phylogenetic groupings dis-played in tree plots calculated from the RAPD and ISSR data matrix correlated with the geographical origin of the fungi materials. Genetic profiles partially cor-related with the chemotypes. Phytochemical contents mainly correlated with the strains. A method based on RAPD and HPLC is described to establish genetic and chemical quality control of Armillaria mellea simultaneously. Ten RAPD pri-mers and a coefficient of >0.95 can be used in authentication of Armillaria mellea. The fingerprints obtained with HPLC consist of 22 common peaks within 45min.

Its silencing may contribute to the carcinogenesis and progression of various tumors, which makes this gene an attractive molecular marker and a potential target for diagnosis and therapy. Little is known about transcriptional mechanisms controlling SLC5A8 gene expression. To better understand the molecular mechanisms regulating SLC5A8 expression, we characterized the 5′-regulatory region and a part of exon 1. Luciferase reporter assays of deletion mutants of SLC5A8 promoter demonstrated that a 295-bp region is essential for the basal promoter activity of the SLC5A8 gene. Further analysis indicated that the CCAAT boxes and GC boxes were involved in positive regulation of SLC5A8 promoter. Overexpression of two transcription factors, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) and specific transcription factor 1 (Sp1), upregulated the activities of the human SLC5A8 promoter and protein expression, suggesting that both C/EBPβ and Sp1 transcription factors might have functions in SLC5A8 transcription. Taken together, our results elucidate the mechanism underlying the regulation of SLC5A8 gene transcription and also define a novel regulatory sequence that may be used to increase expression of the SLC5A8 gene in cancer gene therapy. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77952306758	Butyrate induces cell apoptosis through activation of JNK MAP kinase pathway in human colon cancer RKO cells	Butyrate has been shown to display anti-cancer activity through the induction of apoptosis in various cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanism involved in butyrate-induced apoptosis is still not fully understood. Here, we investigated the cytotoxicity mechanism of butyrate in human colon cancer RKO cells. The results showed that butyrate induced a strong growth inhibitory effect against RKO cells. Butyrate also effectively induced apoptosis in RKO cells, which was characterized by DNA fragmentation, nuclear staining of DAPI, and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. The expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 decreased, whereas the apoptotic protein Bax increased in a dose-dependent manner during butyrate-induced apoptosis. Moreover, treatment of RKO cells with butyrate induced a sustained activation of the phosphorylation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the pharmacological inhibition of JNK MAPK by SP600125 significantly abolished the butyrate-induced apoptosis in RKO cells. These results suggest that butyrate acts on RKO cells via the JNK but not the p38 pathway. Butyrate triggered the caspase apoptotic pathway, indicated by an enhanced Bax-to-Bcl-2 expression ratio and caspase cascade reaction, which was blocked by SP600125. Taken together, our data indicate that butyrate induces apoptosis through JNK MAPK activation in colon cancer RKO cells. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77957163489	Basic FGF downregulates TSP50 expression via the ERK/Sp1 pathway	Previous studies demonstrated that the expression of testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50) was increased in breast cancer cells and that overexpression of TSP50 can promote tumorigenesis. Thus, it is important to identify the regulatory mechanisms of TSP50 for tumor therapy. In this study, we elucidated the mechanism underlying TSP50 downregulation by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). We used MDA-MB-231 and HEK293T cell lines to address this issue. RT-PCR and promoter activity assays indicated that bFGF downregulates TSP50 expression via transcriptional activation. We next investigated the signaling pathway that mediated the effect of bFGF on TSP50 transcription, and identified that bFGF induced the phosphorylation of ERK and Sp1. An ERK inhibitor suppressed Sp1 phosphorylation and bFGF-reduced TSP50 expression at the mRNA level. In addition, the dominant negative (DN) mutants of ERK and Sp1 both suppressed the reduction of TSP50 by bFGF. Deletion and mutation analyses indicated that the Sp1 site, located within the +237/+239 region of the human TSP50 promoter, is the major responsive element for bFGF. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that bFGF mediates TSP50 downregulation by ERK activation, leading to the phosphorylation of Sp1 in this process. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

78149253777	Activin A induces SLC5A8 expression through the Smad3 signaling pathway in human colon cancer RKO cells	SLC5A8 (Solute carrier family 5, member 8), proposed to be a potential tumor suppressor gene, is down-regulated by epigenetic changes in some colorectal cancer cells, and ectopic expression of SLC5A8 in SLC5A8-deficient colon cancer cell lines leads to suppression of the colony-forming ability of these cells. Activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of tumor (and normal) human cell types. However, the mechanism(s) by which activin A exerts its inhibitory effects are not yet understood. In this study, we showed that activin A up-regulated SLC5A8 expression in colorectal cancer RKO cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. To elucidate the underlying mechanism involved in this process, we investigated the activation of the Smad signaling pathway, and analyzed the effects of dominant negative Smad3 and Smad2 proteins on activin A-induced SLC5A8 expression. The results indicated that activin A-induced SLC5A8 expression was dependent on activation of Smad3. Further analysis showed that activin A induced SLC5A8 expression via transcriptional activation. Deletion analysis indicated that the CAGA elements located within the -273/-222 region of the human SLC5A8 promoter were responsive to activin A. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that activin A up-regulates SLC5A8 expression through the Smad signaling pathway, which also partially explains the inhibitory effects of activin A in RKO cells. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79551604904	Reversal effect of Dioscin on multidrug resistance in human hepatoma HepG2/adriamycin cells	Multidrug resistance is a serious obstacle encountered in cancer treatment. Since drug resistance in human cancer is mainly associated with overexpression of the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), the promoter of the human MDR1 gene may be a target for multidrug resistance reversion drug screening. In the present study, HEK293T cells were transfected with pGL3 reporter plasmids containing the 2 kb of MDR1 promoter, and the transfected cells were used as models to screen for candidate multidrug resistance inhibitors from over 300 purified naturally occurring compounds extracted from plants and animals. Dioscin was found to have an inhibiting effect on MDR1 promoter activity. The resistant HepG2 cell line (HepG2/adriamycin) was used to validate the activity of multidrug resistance reversal by Dioscin. Results showed that Dioscin could decrease the resistance degree of HepG2/adriamycin cells, and significantly inhibit P-glycoprotein expression, as well as increase the accumulation of adriamycin in HepG2/adriamycin cells as measured by Flow Cytometric analysis.

79952022730	Knockdown of TSP50 inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in P19 cells	Earlier studies identified testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50), which encodes a threonine protease, and showed that it was abnormally reactivated in many breast cancer biopsies. Further, it was shown to be negatively regulated by the p53 gene. However, little is known about the biological function of TSP50. In this study, we applied RNA interference to knockdown TSP50 gene expression in P19 murine embryonal carcinoma stem cells and tested whether this modulated the cell phenotype. The results showed that downregulation of TSP50 expression not only reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration but also induced cell apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that knockdown of TSP50 resulted in greater sensitivity to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and that activation of caspase-3 was involved in this process. © 2010 IUBMB.

79955692257	Nogo-66 inhibits the dye-coupling of astrocytic gap junctions in vitro	Communication between astrocytes via the gap junction is crucial for maintaining homeostasis of the extra-neuronal microenvironment of the central nervous system. Dysfunction of astrocytic gap junctions is involved in many brain disorders. Our previous studies demonstrated a novel co-localization of Nogo-66 receptor at glial gap junctions in rat cerebellum and posterior pituitary. The present study was aimed at exploring whether Nogo-66 can modulate glial gap junctions in vitro. We confirmed the co-localization of Nogo-66 receptor with Cx43 in cultured astrocytes, and stimulated astrocytes with myelin extracts, or Nogo-66-Fc conditioned medium. Finally, we expressed and purified a functionally effective GST-Nogo-66 peptide. Lucifer yellow transfer assay was adopted to measure the gap junction permeability. The results showed that the spreading of Lucifer yellow was inhibited significantly by all three treatments as compared with their corresponding controls. Therefore, this study shows a novel inhibitory effect of Nogo-66 on the permeability of astrocytic gap junctions, suggesting a presumable role of Nogo-66 receptor in modulating the glial gap junction. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

79955987554	Testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50) promotes cell proliferation through the activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signalling pathway	TSP50 (testes-specific protease 50) is a testis-specific expression protein, which is expressed abnormally at high levels in breast cancer tissues. This makes it an attractive molecular marker and a potential target for diagnosis and therapy; however, the biological function of TSP50 is still unclear. In the present study, we show that overexpression of TSP50 in CHO (Chinese-hamster ovary) cells markedly increased cell proliferation and colony formation. Mechanistic studies have revealed that TSP50 can enhance the level of TNFα (tumour necrosis factor α)- and PMA-induced NF-κB (nuclear factor κB)-responsive reporter activity, IκB (inhibitor of NF-κB) α degradation and p65 nuclear translocation. In addition, the knockdown of endogenous TSP50 inMDA-MB-231 cells greatly inhibited NF-κB activity. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated an interaction of TSP50 with the NF-κB-IκBα complex, but not with the IKK (IκB kinase) α/β-IKKγ complex, which suggested that TSP50, as a novel type of protease, promoted the degradation of IκBα proteins by binding to the NF-κB-IκBα complex. Our results also revealed that TSP50 can enhance the expression of NF-κB target genes involved in cell proliferation. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant-negative IκB mutant that is resistant to proteasome-mediated degradation significantly reversed TSP50-induced cell proliferation, colony formation and tumour formation in nude mice. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that TSP50 promotes cell proliferation, at least partially, through activation of the NF-κB signalling pathway. © The Authors Journal compilation © 2011 Biochemical Society.

79956014508	Development and characterization of monoclonal antibody specifically against TSP50	Testis-specific protease 50(TSP50) has been identified as a testis-specific protein that is expressed abnormally in most human breast cancer samples, which makes it an attractive molecular marker and a potential target for diagnosis and therapy. In the present study, we prepared a panel of monoclonal antibodies(mAbs) with high specificity and sensitivity against TSP50 by hybridoma method and characterized them by ELISA, Western blot, immunofluroescence and immunohistochemical analyses. The results show that all of the 9 different clones can specifically bind to TSP50. The mAbs against TSP50 we generated could be good tools for both basic and clinical studies.

79959471528	Alantolactone inhibits cell proliferation by interrupting the interaction between Cripto-1 and activin receptor type II A in activin signaling pathway	It has been suggested that deregulation of activin signaling contributes to tumor formation. Activin signaling is blocked in cancer cells due to the complex formed by Cripto-1, activin, and activin receptor type II (ActRII). In this study, the authors used a mammalian two-hybrid system to construct a drug screening model to obtain a small molecular inhibitor capable of interrupting the interaction between Cripto-1 and ActRII. They screened 300 natural components and identified alantolactone. Data suggested that alantolactone induced activin/SMAD3 signaling in human colon adenocarcinoma HCT-8 cells. The authors also found that alantolactone exhibited antiproliferative function specific to tumor cells, with almost no toxicity to normal cells at a concentration of 5 μg/mL. Furthermore, they proved that the antiproliferative function of alantolactone was activin/SMAD3 dependent. These results suggest that alantolactone performs its antitumor effect by interrupting the interaction between Cripto-1 and the activin receptor type IIA in the activin signaling pathway. Moreover, screening for inhibitors of Cripto-1/ActRII is a potentially beneficial approach to aid in discovering novel cancer treatment. © 2011 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.

80051902269	Anthracene and anthraquinone derivatives from the stem bark of Juglans mandshurica Maxim.	One new anthracene derivative, juglanthracenoside A (1), two new anthraquinones, juglanthraquinone A (2) and juglanthraquinone B (3), along with a new naturally occurring anthraquinone, 9,10-dihydro-4,8-dihydroxy-9,10- dioxoanthracene-2-carboxylic acid (4), have been isolated from the stem bark of Juglans mandshurica. Their structures were established by detailed spectroscopic analysis and comparison of the NMR data with those of related compounds. Compound 1 displayed noticeable antioxidant activity in both 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azinobis(3- ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) free radical-scavenging assays, while compound 4 showed strong cytotoxicity against HepG2, SGC7901, HCT-8, and A549 cell lines in vitro.

80255134517	Histone deacetylase 1 is required for Carbamazepine-induced CYP3A4 expression	Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a commonly prescribed antiepileptic drug. Adverse effects and drug-drug interaction are the two major concerns for its clinic application. CBZ is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, a strong inducer of CYP3A4 as well, which in turn influences the pharmaceutical profiles of the co-administrated drugs. To date, little is known about the mechanisms underlying CBZ-induced CYP3A4 expression. In this study, we explored the possible roles of Pregnane X receptor (PXR) and the histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) on the CBZ-induced CYP3A4 expression. The results showed that: (1) Although the expression of PXR was increased in CBZ treated cells, PXR gene silencing surprisingly showed no significant effects on CBZ-induced CYP3A4 expression; (2) CBZ inhibited the binding of HDAC1 to the promoter of CYP3A4. In addition, both dominant negative form and siRNA of HDAC1 could repress the CBZ-induced CYP3A4 expression. These data, for the first time indicate that HDAC1, is required for the CBZ-induced CYP3A4 expression. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84860521722	The threonine protease activity of testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50) is essential for its function in cell proliferation	Background: Testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50), a newly discovered threonine enzyme, has similar amino acid sequences and enzymatic structures to those of many serine proteases. It may be an oncogene. TSP50 is up-regulated in breast cancer epithelial cells, and ectopic expression of TSP50 in TSP50-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells has been found to promote cell proliferation. However, the mechanisms by which TSP50 exerts its growth-promoting effects are not yet fully understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: To delineate whether the threonine protease activity of TSP50 is essential to its function in cell proliferation, we constructed and characterized a mutant TSP50, called TSP50 T310A, which was identified as a protease-dead mutant of TSP50. By a series of proliferation analyses, colony formation assays and apoptosis analyses, we showed that T310A mutation significantly depresses TSP50-induced cell proliferation in vitro. Next, the CHO stable cell line expressing either wild-type or T310A mutant TSP50 was injected subcutaneously into nude mice. We found that the T310A mutation could abolish the tumorigenicity of TSP50 in vivo. A mechanism investigation revealed that the T310A mutation prevented interaction between TSP50 and the NF-κBIκBα complex, which is necessary for TSP50 to perform its function in cell proliferation. Conclusion: Our data highlight the importance of threonine 310, the most critical protease catalytic site in TSP50, to TSP50-induced cell proliferation and tumor formation. © 2012 Li et al.

84865120370	Juglanthraquinone C, a novel natural compound derived from Juglans mandshurica Maxim, induces S phase arrest and apoptosis in HepG2 cells	Juglanthraquinone C (1,5-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone-3-carboxylic acid, JC), a naturally occurring anthraquinone isolated from the stem bark of Juglans mandshurica, shows strong cytotoxicity in various human cancer cells in vitro. Here, we first performed a structure-activity relationship study of six anthraquinone compounds (JC, rhein, emodin, aloe-emodin, physcion and chrysophanol) to exploit the relationship between their structural features and activity. The results showed that JC exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity of all compounds evaluated. Next, we used JC to treat several human cancer cell lines and found that JC showed an inhibitory effect on cell viability in dose-dependent (2.5-10 lg/ml JC) and timedependent (24-48 h) manners. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of JC on HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cells was more significant as shown by an IC50 value of 9 ± 1.4 lg/ml, and 36 ± 1.2 lg/ml in L02 (human normal liver) cells. Further study suggested that JC-induced inhibition HepG2 cell proliferation was associated with S phase arrest, decreased protein expression of proliferation marker Ki67, cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2, and increased expression of cyclin E and CDK inhibitory protein Cip1/p21. In addition, JC significantly triggered apoptosis in HepG2 cells, which was characterized by increased chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, activation of caspase-9 and -3, and induction of a higher Bax/Bcl2 ratio. Collectively, our study demonstrated that JC can efficiently inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

In this study, we aimed to screen 73 dehydroabietylamine derivatives as potential candidate inhibitors in liver cancer cells. Initially, the compounds structural activity relationship analysis was explored and N-benzoyl-12-nitrodehydroabietylamine-7-one (compound 81) was shown to have significant growth inhibitory activity in the human liver carcinoma cell line, HepG2. Further research into the anti-proliferative effect on HepG2 cells mediated by compound 81 was undertaken. The results suggest that compound 81 effectively induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells characterized by nuclear staining of DAPI, TUNEL assay and the activation of caspase-3. A decreased level of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and increased apoptotic Bax were also observed. Furthermore, Ki-67 protein staining and the BrdU incorporation assay showed that compound 81 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells. Cell cycle components analysis found that expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 was reduced in HepG2 cells with compound 81 treatment, whereas the content of p21

84866991096	Pharmacodynamic differential serum chromatography for identifying the pharmacodynamic material basis of a traditional Chinese medicine	The modernization and marketing of traditional Chinese medicine is difficult primarily because its pharmacodynamic material basis has not been elucidated. Moreover, a central problem is the lack of effective research methods and strategies. After[20 years of study, here, we propose the theory of pharmacodynamic differential serum chromatography. The method described here can be used to identify (and possibly develop) effective pharmacodynamic materials. In light of the theory, we identified hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) to be the effective pharmacodynamic material of Carthamus tinctorius L. (safflower). With the help of the methodology described here, the modernization and understanding of traditional Chinese medicine may be accelerated. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84867572360	6-[(1-naphthylmethyl)sulfanyl]-9H-purine induces G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells	Due to the increasing incidence of cancer, a leading cause of death worldwide, discovery of new therapeutic drugs is urgently needed. By screening for agents with low toxicity that selectively target cancer cells, we found that 6-[(1-naphthylmethyl) sulfanyl]-9H-purine (NMMP), a derivative of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), could reduce the viability of five human cancer cell lines. Further study suggested that NMMP inhibition of the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells was associated with G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, and reduced cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and cyclin B1/D1 levels. In addition, NMMP induced cell apoptosis, as determined by TUNEL assay. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the expression of cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 as well as the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein increased significantly. Overall, our results suggest that NMMP exerts anti-tumor activities through induction of G2/M phase arrest and mitochondria-dependent cell apoptosis, implicating its potential therapeutic value for the treatment of cancer. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In traditional Chinese medicine, Gentiana macrophylla Pall. and Gentiana straminea Maxim. have also been used under the name Gentianae Macrophyllae Radix and prescribed for the treatment of pain and inflammatory conditions. Aim of study: The present study evaluated the pharmacological effects of two species of Radix Gentianae Macrophyllae in experimental inflammation and pain models, and determined the chemical compounds that may correlate with their pharmacological activities. The comparison is needed to identify whether the two related plants can be used interchangeably. Materials and methods: We evaluated the pharmacological effects of the flowers of Gentiana macrophylla Pall. and Gentiana straminea Maxim. in experimental inflammation and pain models. An HPLC-MS method was developed to analyze the chemical composition. The effects of Gentiana macrophylla Pall. and Gentiana straminea Maxim. on the p65 and p50 phosphorylation were examined by immunblotting. NF-κB transcriptional activity was measured using the luciferase assay, in vitro kinase assay and Griess reaction. Results: The extracts of Gentiana macrophylla Pall. and Gentiana straminea Maxim. possessed significant antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities. Flavonoids, secoiridoid glycosides and triterpines were determined in the extracts and may be the basis of the observed pharmacological effects. Nuclear translocation of p65, p50 and NF-κB transcriptional activity induced by LPS were suppressed by Gentiana macrophylla Pall. and Gentiana straminea Maxim. Conclusion: The results clearly demonstrated that the chemical composition and pharmacological activities of the two herbs were similar, which support the interchangeability among the two herbs when using them in folk medicine. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84871683178	Virtual screening of specific insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) Inhibitors from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) molecular database	Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) is an attractive drug target for cancer therapy and research on IGF1R inhibitors has had success in clinical trials. A particular challenge in the development of specific IGF1R inhibitors is interference from insulin receptor (IR), which has a nearly identical sequence. A few potent inhibitors that are selective for IGF1R have been discovered experimentally with the aid of computational methods. However, studies on the rapid identification of IGF1R-selective inhibitors using virtual screening and confidence-level inspections of ligands that show different interactions with IGF1R and IR in docking analysis are rare. In this study, we established virtual screening and binding-mode prediction workflows based on benchmark results of IGF1R and several kinase receptors with IGF1R-like structures. We used comprehensive analysis of the known complexes of IGF1R and IR with their binding ligands to screen specific IGF1R inhibitors. Using these workflows, 17 of 139,735 compounds in the NCI (National Cancer Institute) database were identified as potential specific inhibitors of IGF1R. Calculations of the potential of mean force (PMF) with GROMACS were further conducted for three of the identified compounds to assess their binding affinity differences towards IGF1R and IR. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84881062200	Resveratrol sensitizes tamoxifen in antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer cells with epithelial-mesenchymal transition features	Tamoxifen resistance remains to be a huge obstacle in the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer, and this therefore highlights the dire need to explore the underlying mechanisms. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a molecular process through which an epithelial cell transfers into a mesenchymal phenotype. Roles of EMT in embryo development, cancer invasion and metastasis have been extensively reported. Herein, we established tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7/TR breast cancer cells and showed that MCF-7/TR cells underwent EMT driven by enhanced endogenous TGF-β/Smad signaling. Ectopic supplement of TGF-β promoted in MCF-7 cells a mesenchymal and resistant phenotype. In parallel, we demonstrated that resveratrol was capable of synergizing with tamoxifen and triggering apoptosis in MCF-7/TR cells. Further Western blot analysis indicated that the chemosensitizing effects of resveratrol were conferred with its modulation on endogenous TGF-β production and Smad phosphorylation. In particular, 50 μM resveratrol had minor effects on MCF-7/TR cell proliferation, but could significantly attenuate endogenous TGF-β production and the Smad pathway, ultimately leading to reversion of EMT. Collectively, our study highlighted distinct roles of EMT in tamoxifen resistance and resveratrol as a potential agent to overcome acquired tamoxifen resistance. The molecular mechanism of resveratrol chemosensitizing effects is, at least in part, TGF-β/Smad-dependent. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84885177850	Conditioned medium of Wnt/β-catenin signaling-activated olfactory ensheathing cells promotes synaptogenesis and neurite growth in vitro	Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), the major glia cells in the olfactory system, have been extensively studied because of their ability to promote axonal growth and regeneration. Whether it could facilitate synaptogenesis is an important, but remains as yet an unanswered question. We have identified a subgroup of Wnt signaling-activated OECs, spatiotemporal distribution of which in the olfactory bulb suggests a role for these cells in both axonal growth and synaptogenesis. In the present study, we explored this possibility in vitro. OECs were primarily cultured, in which Wnt signaling was activated by overexpressing β-catenin, and inhibited by dominant negative TCF4. Neurite growth and synaptogenesis were assessed by co-culturing neurons with conditioned medium from control OECs (cOECs CM), Wnt/β-catenin signaling-activated OECs (wOECs CM), or Wnt signaling-inhibited OECs (wiOECs). The results showed that although cOECs CM enhances axonal growth, wOECs CM exhibited a stronger axonal growth-promoting effect, than cOECs CM. More importantly, wOECs CM stimulates synatpogenesis, demonstrated by the expression of Synaptophysin and whole-cell patch clamp recording. In contrast, both cOECs CM and wiOECs CM do not affect synaptogenesis. Our data, for the first time, demonstrated that, in comparison with regularly cultured OECs, wOECs CM are more effective in enhancing axonal growth, and can promote synaptogenesis, probably by secreting factors. These results suggest a potential application of wOECs for treating spinal cord injury. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84890054965	Alantolactone induces cell apoptosis partially through down-regulation of testes-specific protease 50 expression	Testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50) is aberrantly expressed in many cancer biopsies and plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis, which make it a potential cancer therapeutic target for drug discovery. Here, we constructed a firefly luciferase reporter driven by the TSP50 gene promoter to screen natural compounds capable of inhibiting the expression of TSP50. Then we identified alantolactone, a sesquiterpene lactone, could efficiently inhibit the promoter activity of TSP50 gene, further results revealed that alantolactone also efficiently inhibited the expression of TSP50 in both mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, we found alantolactone could increase the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, and activate caspase-9 and caspase-3 in the cancer cells with high expression of TSP50, surprisingly, the same effects can also be observed in the same cells just by knockdown of TSP50 gene expression. Furthermore, our results suggested that overexpression of TSP50 decreased the cell sensitivity to alantolactone-induced apoptosis in those cancer cells. Taken together, these results suggest that alantolactone induces mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis at least partially via down-regulation of TSP50 expression. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84891304654	Prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate infection prevention in adult patients after tension-free inguinal hernia repair	Objective: Infection is one of possible complications after prosthetic material hernia repair surgery. Antibiotic prophylaxis is applied routinely in China, but its effect is still controversial. The present study aims to offer direct clinical evidence on prevention of infection after tension-free inguinal hernia repair. Methods: A total of 1,200 cases with primary inguinal hernia treated in 6 hospitals in Shaanxi Province were enrolled in this study. They were randomly divided into three groups (n = 400 per group): placebo control group, Cefazolin group and Levofloxacin group after tensionfree inguinal hernia repair using polypropylene mesh. Hernia type, age, gender, weight and complications were recorded. The sur-gical- site infection was diagnosed according to APIC, CDC criteria (http://www.apic. org). Infections were evaluated every other day in the first week, and then at 14 days, 21 days and 30 days following surgery. Results: Two cases from the placebo group, 3 from the Cefazolin group and 3 from the Levofloxacin group failed to follow-up. Six patients (2 non-following the protocol, 2 severe depression, and 2 laparoscopic surgery) from the placebo group, 14 (8 nonreceiving trial medication, 5 laparoscopic surgery, and 1 failure to tolerance) from the Cefazolin group, and 12 (2 combination of antibiotic usage, 5 laparoscopic surgery and 5 failure to tolerance) from the Levofloxacin group were excluded. The data of the 1,160 cases were statistically analyzed in the incidence rates of surgical-site infection and complications after inguinal hernia repair. Surgical-site infection including wound infection, cellulitis or mesh-related infection was found in 20 cases (5.1%) of the control group, 15 (3.92%) of the Cefazolin group and 17 (4.42%) of the Levofloxacin group, and the difference among the three groups was not statistically significant (χ

84900871973	Regulatory mechanisms of annexin-induced chemotherapy resistance in cisplatin resistant lung adenocarcinoma	Adenocarcinoma of lung has high incidence and a poor prognosis, woith chemotherapy as the main therapeutic tool, most commonly with cisplatin. However, chemotherapy resistance develops in the majority of patients during clinic treatment. Mechanisms of resistance are complex and still unclear. Although annexin play important roles in various tumor resistance mechanisms, their actions in cisplatin-resistant lung adenocarcinoma remain unclear. Preliminary studies by our group found that in cisplatin-resistant lung cancer A549 cells and lung adenocarcinoma tissues, both mRNA and protein expression of annexins A1, A2 and A3 is increased. Using a library of annexin A1, A2 and A3 targeting combined molecules already established by ourselves we found that specific targeting decreased cisplatin-resistance. Taken together, the underlined effects of annexins A1, A2 and A3 on drug resistance and suggest molecular mechanisms in cisplatin-resistant A549 cells both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the study points to improved research on occurrence and development of lung adenocarcinoma, with provision of effective targets and programmes for lung adenocarcinoma therapy in the clinic.

84904874001	The catalytic triad of testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50) is essential for its function in cell proliferation	Testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50) is a novelly identified pro-oncogene and it shares a similar enzymatic structure with many serine proteases. Our previous results suggested that TSP50 could promote tumorigenesis through degradation of IκBα protein and activating NF-κB signaling, and the threonine mutation in its catalytic triad could depress TSP50-mediated cell proliferation. However, whether the two other residues in the catalytic triad of TSP50 play a role in maintaining protease activity and tumorigenesis, and the mechanisms involved in this process remain unclear. Here, we constructed and characterized three catalytic triad mutants of TSP50 and found that all the mutants could significantly depress TSP50-induced cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro and tumor formation in vivo, and the aspartic acid at position 206 in the catalytic triad played a more crucial role than threonine and histidine in this process. Mechanistic studies revealed that the mutants in the catalytic triad abolished the enzyme activity of TSP50, but did not change the cellular localization. Furthermore, our data indicated that all the three mutants suppressed activation of NF-κB signal by preventing the interaction between TSP50 and the NF-κB:IκBα complex. Most importantly, we demonstrated that TSP50 could interact with IκBα protein and cleave it directly as a new protease in vitro. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84908335439	Systematic analysis of time-series gene expression data on tumor cell-selective apoptotic responses to HDAC inhibitors	SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or vorinostat) is the first nonselective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). SAHA affects histone acetylation in chromatin and a variety of nonhistone substrates, thus influencing many cellular processes. In particularly, SAHA induces selective apoptosis of tumor cells, although the mechanism is not well understood. A series of microarray experiments was recently conducted to investigate tumor cell-selective proapoptotic transcriptional responses induced by SAHA. Based on that gene expression time series, we propose a novel framework for detailed analysis of the mechanism of tumor cell apoptosis selectively induced by SAHA. Our analyses indicated that SAHA selectively disrupted the DNA damage response, cell cycle, p53 expression, and mitochondrial integrity of tumor samples to induce selective tumor cell apoptosis. Our results suggest a possible regulation network. Our research extends the existing research.
