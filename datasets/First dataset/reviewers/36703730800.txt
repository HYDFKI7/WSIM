20544467898	Experimental investigation of hybrid-evaporation-glow discharge plasma immersion ion implantation	High-voltage pulsed glow discharge is applied to plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). In the glow discharge, the target constitutes the cathode and the gas tube forms the anode under a relatively high working gas pressure of 0.15-0.2 Pa. The characteristics of the glow discharge and ion density are measured experimentally. Our results show resemblance to hollow-anode glow discharge and the anode fall is faster than that of general glow discharge. Because of electron focusing in the anode tube orifice, ions are ionized efficiently and most of them impact the negatively biased samples. The resulting ion current density is higher than that in other PIII modes and possible mechanisms of the glow discharge PIII are proposed and discussed. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.

20244389244	Evaporation-glow discharge hybrid source for plasma immersion ion implantation	The plasma ion sources play a very important role in the plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) process. In this paper, we report on our newly designed evaporation-glow discharge hybrid ion source for PIII. The high negative substrate bias not only acts as the plasma producer but also provides the implantation voltage. The sulfur vapor gas glow discharge shows that the electrons in the plasma are focused to the orifice of the inlet tube, thereby helping the ionization of the fleeing vapor gases. The sulfur depth profile confirms that this evaporation-glow discharge hybrid source is effective for materials with a low melting point and high vapor pressure. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The research indicates that during the process, the microstructure of welding materials at the friction interfaces change due to energy concentration, and viscous quasi-liquid layer forms. The results show that it is necessary for welding to form certain thickness quasi-liquid layers. The micro quasi-liquid metals are sprayed backwards to solidify to form final weld.

36448950851	Numerical study on stress induced cambering distortion and its mitigation in welded titanium alloy sheet	Arc welding process is widely used for fabricated thin structures in aerospace, shipyard, etc. Welding deformation is undesirable owing to the decrease in buckling strength and injures the beautiful appearance of structures. In addition, it causes errors during the assembly which result in more rework and productivity restriction. Welding deformation is complicated in real structure and is difficult to control. In the present study, numerical simulation by applying finite element has been performed using ANSYS to predict residual stress and cambering distortion in welded titanium alloy sheet. Furthermore, attempt was made to eliminate this distortion by applying dynamic spot cooling source technique behind the welding torch. The computed result revealed that the cambering could be eliminated under proper control of the parameters of this technique, such as the distance between the two sources. Transient residual stress through the thickness exhibit different behaviour and magnitude from that in conventional welding, and its cost is minimised by such technique. Explanation of this minimising mechanism was discussed. © 2006 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

37349109235	Transferring mechanism of the coating rod in friction surfacing	A coating rod of 1Cr18Ni9Ti (321) was deposited on the substrate of mild steel 1020 to be able to perform a friction surfacing experiment. The temperature changes of special points on the coating rod were measured using a thermocouple. The results show that the temperature increase rate at the friction interface reached a high level at first. Then the rate decreased to a low level once the friction system became quasi-steady and the temperature became approximately stable near the melting point of the coating rod. The theory of contact melting was used to build the physical model for the quasi-liquid layer. Subsequently, the corresponding calculations were carried out. The computer simulation results are found to be consistent with the experiment results, and as such, the present study demonstrates the feasibility of applying contact melting theory to the study of friction surfacing. Likewise, this study reveals that the material at the top of the coating rod is plastic, and that it behaves as a quasi-liquid in the friction surfacing process. The study establishes the theory basis for the study of the mechanism of friction surfacing, and provides a new method for investigating other friction-welding techniques. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

0033122662	Experimental study of the fracture properties of oil pipeline girth welds	The application of fracture mechanics to the `Fitness For Purpose' assessment of the fracture properties of pipeline girth welds is generally essential for the safe operation of oil pipeline systems. Based on the analysis of the fracture toughness requirements of the oil pipeline girth weld, a systematic study has been conducted on the fracture behavior of the API 5L X65 steel pipeline girth weld made by two welding materials. The critical COD values of the pipeline girth weld under the different temperatures are tested. In the paper other influential factors on fracture behavior are also discussed, such as the welding materials, the welding positions (flat welding, vertical welding, overhead welding), the welded joint area (weld, heat-affected zone, fusion line and base metal) and the experiment temperature. The result shows that the welding material, the welded joint area and the experiment temperature have considerable influence on the fracture behavior of pipeline girth welds. It is also concluded that the effect of the welding position is related to the welding process. The study provides a scientific basis for the welding of oil pipelines.

0034270344	Research on effect of forced-heat-transfer on buckling distortion of thin plate during welding	The generating mechanism of buckling distortion of thin plates during welding is discussed. The controlling effectiveness of forced-heat-transfer on buckling distortion is conducted comprehensively and the concept of effect of forced-heat-transfer is presented. By using the finite difference method, the evolvement and shape of temperature fields of the specimens is simulated credibly. The key influential factors of temperature field are analyzed. The results of theoretical and experimental research illustrate that the effect of forced-heat-transfer can markedly reduce the residual stress and eliminate the buckling distortion of thin plates during welding by deforming the welding temperature field to lower the level of compressing plastic deformation. The results also give directions for applying the effect of forced-heat-transfer effectively.

33644941192	Numerical simulation of consumable-rod's thermal-mechanical behavior in friction surfacing	By finite element method and rigid-viscoplastic model, the coupling of 3-D temperature field and deformation field of consumable-rod during friction surfacing process was simulated. Temperature change and deformation of consumable-rod were analyzed. The factors influencing temperatures were discussed. Temperature change of consumable-rod was measured by thermocouple. It was showed in the simulation results that the temperature increase rate at friction interface was higher at first, then became lower. Once the friction system became quasi-steady, the temperature here would be stable approximately. Special temperature gradient was found at consumable-rod's bottom end. The friction interface firstly became viscoplastic and then deformed. The largest effective strain existed near the center of the bottom of the circle. The simulation results are consistent with experiments, reappearing temperature change and deformation of consumable-rod during friction surfacing. The results can be helpful in the study of process mechanism and supplying the theoretical guide to choose key technical parameters in engineering practice.

80052973423	Effect of weld metal hardening property on crack driving force and deformation behavior of mismatched welded joint	Effect of weld metal hardening property on the deformation behavior and crack driving force of strength mismatched welded joint with crack has been investigated using finite element method under plain strain condition. The results show that when the apply load is small, there is only small scale deformation around the crack tip, the whole structure is still in linear or small scale yielding condition therefore the weld metal hardening property has no significant effect on crack driving force. As the applied load increasing, the deformation region enlarges and at the same time the deformation level around the crack tip deepens, the increasing of weld metal hardening property decreases the local deformation level, consequently leading to the decreasing of the crack cracking force. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

Effects of strength mismatching, crack length and stress-strain curve form of base metal on crack tip opening displacement were analyzed. The results show that the crack driving force increases with the increasing of strength mismatch factor, the influence of strength mismatching for welded joints with shallow cracks is more significant than those with deep cracks. When the base metal doesn't show yield platform, the cracking driving force increases monotonously with the applied strain. For the base metal with yield platform, the cracking driving force and applied strain relationship presents a stage change for over-matched or welded joint with shallow crack, which caused by that the strain hardening of base metal lags behind the deformation of weld metal.

42449155492	Figuration control of deposit in friction surfacing	Friction Surfacing is an advanced surface modification method, so it is of great importance to study figuration mechanism of deposit in friction surfacing process for controlling deposit's quality. By friction surfacing, consumable-rod of 1Cr18Ni9Ti (321)was surfaced on the substrate of mild steel (1020) by different process parameters (rotation speed, force and traverse speed). The effects of process parameters on deposit's figuration are discussed. Experiments show that deposit's width and thickness decrease linearly with increasing consumable-rod rotation speed; deposit's width increases and its thickness decreases with increasing force. If traverse speed between substrate and consumable-rod increases, deposit's thickness and width decrease simultaneously. According to conservation of mass, the material transferring & figuration rules in friction surfacing were analyzed, which explains the experimental results as well. So, figuration control methods of deposit in friction surfacing are set up. In practice, process parameters must be chosen properly to ensure good figuration. Only if process parameters are inside the feasible area, material can transfer fluently and deposit with good figuration could be got.

77952123734	Preparation of nano-silver flake by chemical reduction method	The nano-silver flake with about 30 nm, was prepared by a chemical reduction method. Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was used to prevent agglomeration of the nanoparticles by its steric hindrance. However, an excessive amount of CTAB will impede the growth of silver nanoparticles, and thus it is not beneficial to the formation of the desired morphology. When the mass ratio of CTAB to silver nitrate is 0.8, the nano-silver with flaky structure can be obtained. At temperature of 20°C, the solubility of CTAB is low, and it is difficult to retard the agglomeration effectively. At the same time, the low reaction rate will lead to large and nonuniform nanoparticles. When the temperature is 40°C, the increased solubility of CTAB promotes the forming of nanoparticle. Nevertheless, when the temperature reaches 60°C, the reaction is so fast that the nucleation rate increases and thus tiny particles are formed eventually. High pH value will lead to promote the reaction and ensure the complete consumption of Ag

77956240082	Effects of pigments on the uv degradation of wood-flour/HDPE composites	The effects of different color pigments on the durability of wood-flour/high-density polyethylene composites (WF/HDPE) were evaluated by UV-accelerated weathering tests. WF/HDPE composites were dyed using three different color inorganic pigments, which were added at 2% based on the weight of the composite. Samples were weathered in Q-panel UV aging equipment for 1500 h. All samples showed significant fading and color changes in exposed areas. Changes in surface chemistry were studied using spectroscopic techniques. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to verify the occurrence of surface oxidation. Changes in carbonyl groups (C=O), PE crystallinity, cellulose CAO, and lignin aromatic C=C were detected by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results indicate that surface oxidation occurred immediately within exposure 250 h for all samples; the surface of the control WF/HDPE composites was oxidized to a greater extent than that of the dyed WF/HDPE. This suggests that the addition of pigments to the WF/HDPE composites results in less weather-related damage. The surface configuration observed by scanning electron microscopy revealed that WF/HDPE composites degraded significantly on accelerated UV aging, with dense cracking apparent on the exposed surface. Carbon black had a more positive effect on color stability than the other pigments. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Contact angle were measured at different exposure times for a series of test liquids,and the results showed that the contact angle decreased after being plasma treated under different exposure time, which meant that the surface wettability of the composites was improved significantly. The FTIR analysis results showed that polar groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl were formed on the surface of the composites treated under plasma. And the generation of these polar groups was benefit of improving the wettability and adhesion capability of wood/PE composites. XPS analysis results indicated that the content of oxygen element in the composition of surface element for wood/PE composites increased after plasma treating, and it reached a balance in a short time, meanwhile a lot of carboxyl groups were formed.

The results for dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) shows that in the thermal oxidation process of pyridyl-functionalized SBS(SBSVP), the cross linking gives priority firstly and then the degradation gives priority, and the cross linking and degradation take on dynamic transformation along with time and temperature, which induce the change for modulus and glass-transition temperature of the polymer. The analysis for infrared spectrum (IR) shows that the oxidation of pyridyl-functionalized SBS occurs mainly on butadiene blocks, meanwhile the content of C=C reduces and C=O is formed. X-ray photoelectron specroscopy (XPS) analysis result shows that the content of oxygen in the composition of polymer surface element changes accordingly along with the increase of the aging temperature and the aging time. As for the thermal oxidation of pyridyl-functionalized SBS, the temperature has more obvious effect than that for the time.

SEM and AFM results showed that the roughness of plasma treated samples increased. XPS analysis results indicated that the content of carbon element decreased while the content of oxygen element in the composition of wood/PE composites surface element increased and it reached a balance in a higher power, meanwhile a lot of carboxyl groups were formed. The newly formed polar groups are benefit for the adhesion of composites. The shear bonding strength test showed that the adhesion properties of wood/PE composites improved effectively after plasma treatment. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

79251536585	A method of magnetic scanning imaging for detecting defects in ferromagnetic materials	The paper presents a novel magnetic scanning imaging method for detecting defects in ferromagnetic material, which uses a small permanent magnet to magnetize the ferromagnetic material and measures the single vertical components of magnetic flux densities by bi-reverse-connection Hall sensors. The measured signal is the magnitude of the vertical component of the magnetic flux density rather than the time derivative of total magnetic fluxes. The detection mechanism is researched by finite element simulation for a three-dimensional transient electromagnetic field. The magnetic flux densities produced by the eddy currents generated by a permanent magnet moving over the ferromagnetic material at a speed of less than 1 m s-1 are also simulated, and the results show that the magnetic flux densities produced by eddy currents are very small and can be ignored. The permanent magnet probe and the magnetic scanning imaging system for detecting defects in ferromagnetic material are designed and developed, in which wavelet algorithms are used to enhance the image's quality. Small crack imaging and forged number imaging of a vehicle's engine are realized. Experiments show that this method is simple, suitable for detecting small defects and able to provide shape information on the defects because of its high sensitivity and spatial resolution. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

7944228652	On fatigue crack path deviation at elevated temperature in electron beam repaired weldments of turbine disk	Fatigue crack growth behaviors in electron beam weldments of a nickel-base superalloy are studied. The objective of this paper is to discuss effects of the inhomogeneity of mechanical performance on fatigue crack growth (FCG) rate and crack path deviation (CPD). The base metal served in a turbine disk of aerospace engine was selected to fabricate bead-on-plate weldments by using electron beam welding. Some wedge-type opening loading specimens, notched in three different zone of weld metal, HAZ and base metal, were employed and performed fatigue crack growth tests at 650°C. The results show that the fatigue crack growth of electron beam welded joints is instable due to the influence of mechanical heterogeneities. Owing to the crack deviation at the weld metal and heat-affected-zone (HAZ), the effective growth driving force at the tip of fatigue crack was reduced with the reduction of the effective stress intensity factor (SIF) which finally causes fatigue crack rate decrease. Fatigue crack was strongly affected by size and the symmetrical characteristics of the plastic zone at the crack tip, which means that the integrity of the welded structure containing the fatigue crack mainly depended on the toughness of the low strength zone.

0036720413	Influence of weld mis-matching on fatigue crack growth behaviors of electron beam welded joints	The influences of weld mis-match effects on fatigue crack growth (FCG) rate and crack path deviation (CPD) were studied by virtue of fatigue crack growth experiment of Ni-base superalloy electron beam welded (EBW) joints. The results show that the fatigue crack growth of electron beam welded joints is instable due to the influence of mechanical heterogeneities. The fatigue crack located in the weld metal of overmatched joints deviated from its original growth direction, and then spanned the welded seam and base metal in a mixed mode while propagating. Owing to the crack deviation at the weld metal and heat-affected-zone (HAZ), the effective growth driving force at the tip of fatigue crack was reduced with the reduction of the effective stress intensity factor (SIF) which finally causes fatigue crack rate decrease. As a result, the overmatched joints have the capacity of protecting fatigue crack joints from fast growth. Fatigue crack was strongly affected by size and the symmetrical characteristics of the plastic zone at the crack tip, thus the integrity of the welded structure containing the fatigue crack mainly depended on the toughness of the low strength zone. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

80051655768	Effect of process parameters on weld quality by friction stir welding of 2219 aluminum alloy	In the friction stir welding(FSW) process, welding speed and tool rotation speed are two important parameters, which have great effect on the weld quality. Because neither of each parameter can ensure the welding process effectively, an energy factor n, which is the ratio of rotation speed(ω) to welding speed (v), was selected to represent the heat generation intensity. According to this energy input factor n, the effect of heat input on the weld quality was estimated qualitatively. The results show that the optimized scope for the factor n should be within 2.5 and 6.0, outside of which groove defects and burr defects will appear. ©2011 Editorial Board of CHINA WELDING.

81255176926	Investigation on blocking and deblocking isocyanates by sodium bisulphite	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the effective procedure for blocking and deblocking isocyanate by sodium bisulphite with special cosolvent and dropwise method. Design/methodology/approach - A number of analytical techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Thermo gravimetric analyser (TGA) were employed to assess the reactions between isocyanates and sodium bisulphite, water, cosolvent, also the deblocking temperature of blocked isocyanates. Findings - The blocked isocyanates reacted with sodium bisulphite, water and cosolvent via a special procedure. It was found that the Z NCO functional groups of the isocyanates were completely blocked by sodium bisulphite and a new method for determining the lowest deblocking temperature of the blocked isocyanates was described. It was revealed that the deblocking temperature of blocked isocyanates by sodium bisulphite was lower than others. Practical implications - The paper provides some useful information about the blocking and deblocking of isocyanate, which would be helpful for the preparation of blocking and deblocking isocyanate, and guiding the practical applications of blocked isocyanate. Originality/value - The investigation found that the sodium bisulphite was a very efficient blocking agent for isocyanates at the room temperature via the special procedure developed. On the basis of emulsion polymerisation theory, polymer isocyanates were blocked by sodium bisulphite, which realised the new breakthrough effectively by means of controlled temperature, stirring speed and optimum dropwise speed in the whole reaction system. Meanwhile, the special cosolvent could improve the intermiscibility of isocyanate in sodium bisulphite aqueous solution, reduce the side reaction of isocyanate with water and accelerate reaction rate of isocyanate with sodium bisulphite. If no cosolvent was present, the blocked system would not be homogeneous. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Maleic anhydride grafted high density polyethylene (HDPE-g-MAH) and Maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (PP-g-MAH) have been added as compatibilizing agent. The weight ratio of LDPE, ligin and HDPE-a-MAH were 75:25:7.5, 75:25:10 and 75:25:12.5; the weight ratio of LDPE, ligin and PP-a-MAH were 75:25:5, 75:25:7.5 and 75:25:10 respectively. The mechanical properties of the blends were investigated according to Chinese standard GB/1447-2005 and compared with those of lignin/LDPE composites without compatibilizing agent. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the dispersion of the lignin and PE and the compatibilizing mechanism was analyzed. The results reveal that addition of compatibilizing agent increased the interfacial bonding strength of the composites, improved the mechanical properties and obtained the better dispersion of the lignin and LDPE with HDPE-g-MAH as compatibilizing agent.

Effects of strength mis-matching, hardening property of weld metal and crack length on plastic deformation were analyzed. The results show that strength mis-matching has significant influence on plastic deformation of welded joint. Deformation is first concentrated in weld for under-matched joint, while for over-matched joint, strength over-matching can protect weld metal to some extent. When strength mis-matching facor is constant, the plastic deformation trends for welded joints with different hardening properties of weld metals are similar, whereas local plastic deformation levels are different. Plastic deformation increases with the hardening property of weld metal decreasing.

The particle size distribution rate and the factors influencing the stability of the blocked isocyanate emulsion were studied by varying the stirring speed. Furthermore the blocked isocyanate was characterized using a variety of methods. In order to determine the best stirring speed for preparing blocked isocyanate, a laser particle size analyzer and thermo gravimetric analysis were used to the measure particle size distribution rate and the stability of the blocked isocyanate emulsion, respectively. Experimental results show that blocked rate was 96.77%, and that the blocked isocyanate emulsion dispersion was best, and had the greatest stability, at the stirring speed of 400 r/min. Different solvents were used to wash the blocked isocyanate emulsion and the freeze-dried product. Analysis by XPS, FTIR, DSC and TGA were used to characterize the blocked products, and the blocked isocyanate was also quantitative analyzed. Results from XPS, FTIR, DSC and TGA analytical methods were able to qualitatively analyze the various components of products. Combining these results with the quantitative analysis the blocked rate of instrument analysis was found to be 86.18%. This was lower than the value of 96.77% for the blocked rate measured by chemical analysis. This work could provide a reference for researchers to distinguish the components of blocked isocyanates and provide an instrument analysis method for measuring the blocked rate. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Even though Raman and XPS results show that the carbon films deposited by VAD and PIII-D both possess DLC structures, atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveals that the two sets of films have very different surface morphologies. The growth mechanisms in these two techniques thus differ and the different nucleation and growth mechanisms of the DLC films deposited by VAD and PIII-D can be explained using the statistical formation theory.

Results characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicated that the novel coupling agent VI had a significant effect on the tensile properties of composites due to the formation of chemical bonds between the VI-Kraft interfaces and the VI-UPE interfaces. The tensile properties of composites modified by VI were much better than those of the control composite without VI modification. The VI-modified composites after severe hygrothermal aging exhibited lower losses of tensile properties and desirable tensile durability. The improvement in tensile properties, less interfacial separation after severe hygrothermal aging, lower damping values, and higher glass transition temperature are sufficient to show that the interfacial adhesion between the Kraft fiber and the UPE matrix was significantly improved because the coupling agent VI has both active isocyano groups which react with the Kraft fiber and vinyl groups which are copolymerizable with the UPE resin. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To explore the failure mechanism in the condition of water for the bonding joint of wood/PE composites, the water-resistance of plasma treated wood/PE composites bonding joint was studied and the effect of water on the surface properties of plasma treated wood/PE composites was investigated by using the analysis of contact angle, SEM and FT-IR. The results show that the contact angle increases firstly and then decreases with the soaking time extended, the water absorption for the composite increases and the surface for the sample become more and more rough. However, the number of -OH, C-O and C=O groups on the surface of plasma treated wood/PE composites decreases at first and then increases with the soaking time extended. And the failure mechanism in the condition of water for the bonding joint is related to the change on the surface roughness and chemical radicals for the surface of plasma treated wood/PE composites and the water absorption of the composites due to the soaking with water.

The results show that when the weld slenderness (the ratio of crack ligament to the half-weld width) was small, the limit load of welded joint was close to that of homogeneous welded metal plate with the same geometry. With the increase of slenderness, the limit load of welded joints with different strength mismatched factors converged and the influence of strength mismatching decreased. For a given strength mismatched factor, crack eccentricity had great influence on the limit load of welded joint when the weld slenderness was small, the limit load of under-matched joint increased with the increase of crack eccentricity, while for over-matched joint, the opposite was true. With the increase of weld slenderness, the effect of crack eccentricity on the limit load decreased.

The effects of reaction temperature and time on the degree of substitution of esterified starch were studied, where the results showed that 80. °C of reaction temperature and 3. h of reaction time were optimal conditions. The result of XPS testing demonstrated that the esterification reaction led to increase of ester bonds in starch. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser particle size analyzer results showed that esterification led to roughness on the surface of the starch particle, and the particle size and distribution rate of esterification starch became larger. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrated that esterification reaction did not change the crystalline type of native starch. The differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed that destruction of the crystal structure resulted in improved thermoplasticity of the starch, decreased the gelatinization temperature and increased the thermogravimetric rate of esterification starch. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

0141893248	Evolution of Surface Micro-Features on Titanium Nitride Films Deposited Using Plasma Vacuum Arc Methods	Titanium nitride (TIN) thin films possess excellent wear resistance, a golden color, and other desirable properties. They are therefore quite common in industrial parts and components. TiN films can be fabricated by many methods among which vacuum arc plasma deposition is gaining popularity because of the ease to adjust the processing parameters and the high deposition rate. In order to retain the high efficiency in industrial applications, magnetic filters are not frequently used and macro-particles emitted from the source can contaminate the samples. The macro-particles can reduce the wear resistance and increase the surface roughness of the deposited film as these particles tend to have lower hardness and frequently become the original failure points. A long deposition time, high ion energy, high deposition rate, high deposition temperature, and high sample bias can result in a rougher surface as well. The surface roughness is due to the presence of surface microstructures that stand out from the surface. These microfeatures are usually considered the result of macro-particles on the thin film deposited using vacuum arc methods, or TiN crystalline growth on the macro-particles. In this work, we aim to distinguish the intrinsic nature of the abnormal features. TiN films are deposited respectively using arc deposition with direct vacuum arc plasma source and with filtered vacuum arc plasma source. The surface microstructures resembling buds and seeds are assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and diffraction, the nature of the columnar structures is investigated.

84889884262	The characterization of granule structural changes in acid-thinning starches by new methods and its effect on other properties	Acid-thinned starches (ATSs) have been prepared directly from hydrochloric acid-modified corn starch. The fracture mechanism of starch granule was investigated using scanning electron microscopy combined with laser particle size analysis. And the extent of ATSs chain was also first characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The properties of ATS were tested by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermo gravimetric analysis, and rotational viscometry. Native starch and ATSs exhibit different structures and properties. Amorphous regions of corn starch, located in the interior of the starch granule, are preferentially hydrolyzed and can lead to starch particle fracture. The relative C=O content in the ATSs are increased, indicating that the acid thinning makes the starch molecules shorter, and the fracture extent of the starch molecular chains was 240.86 and 608.97%, respectively. Acid thinning does not change the starch crystal pattern or its basic composition, but it does increase the degree of crystallinity. Compared to the native corn starch, ATSs has a higher gelatinization temperature and a lower enthalpy of gelatinization. The acid thinning treatment drastically reduces the hot paste viscosity of the starch. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used for the qualitative analysis of the esterified starches. The reaction efficiency of dry method esterified starch reached 92.34%. The dry method esterified starch was blended with polylactic acid (PLA), and the mixture was melted and extruded to produce the esterified starch/polylactic acid (ES/PLA) composites. The degree of crystallinity of the ES/PLA was lower than that of the NS/PLA, indicating that the relative dependence between these two components of starch and polylactic acid was enhanced. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the dry method esterified starch increased the two-phase interface compatibility of the composites, thereby improving the tensile strength, bending strength, and elongation at break of the ES/PLA composite. The introduction of a hydrophobic ester bond and increase in interface compatibility led to an increase in ES/PLA water resistance. Melt index determination results showed that starch esterification modification had improved the melt flow properties of starch/PLA composite material. Strain scanning also showed that the compatibility of ES/PLA was increased. While frequency scanning showed that the storage modulus and complex viscosity of ES/PLA was less than that of NS/PLA. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Fine dynamic recrystallization grains appeared in the welded zone where the joint interface fused completely. Micro pores formed in the transition zone where the joint interface fused partly. In the incomplete bonding zone, metals on both sides of the joint interface were not contacted and grains were out of distortion. Moreover, metal fragments developed in the joint interface. Three-branch structure forms in the joint interface due to the separation of the vibration direction flash and the vertical vibration direction flash.

Standard curve was drawn in which the ordinate was carboxyl content determined by national standard method with the ratio of carbonyl absorbance to the key of C-H absorbance in FTIR spectroscopy as the abscissa. The ratio of absorbance of unknown oxidized starch tested by FTIR spectroscopy was obtained, the carboxyl content was calculated by standard curve, and then compared with the carboxyl content determined by national standard method, and the deviation is between 2% and 4%. In order to improve the accuracy of the experiment, standard sample was selected to draw standard curve to better ensure that the carboxyl content of the unknown oxidized starch is in the range of standard curve calculation limit, and deviates from the limit of standard curve. Compared with the carboxyl content determined by national standard method, testing with FTIR spectroscopy is simple, easy to operate, and of high efficiency and better accuracy.

84896277561	Effect of maleic anhydride amount on properties of esterified starch prepared by dry method	Using corn starch as raw material and maleic anhydride (MAH) as esterifying agent, maleic anhydride esterified starch was prepared by dry method. The effect of MAH amount on properties of esterification starch was studied. native starch and esterified starch was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR). the results prove that MAH reacted with starch successfully. esterified starch prepared with different amount of MAH was analyzed by chemical titration method, laser particle size analyzer, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). The results show that degree of substitution gradually increases with the increasing of MAH amount. When m(MAH)/m(starch)>20/100, the degree of substitution gradually becomes stabilized. The properties of esterified starch are closely related to the degree of substitution. The molecular chain of esterified starches grows with the increasing of the degree of substitution, which results in the crystallinity and gelatinization temperature decreaing, as well as the thermal stability worse.

84898688167	Micro-defect characteristics in TC4 linear friction welding joints in relation to amplitude	Microdefect characteristics in TC4 linear friction welding joints in relation to amplitude was studied from the standpoint of mechanics. The results indicated that the type of microdefect characteristics included micro pore which were formed in the partly fused joint interface and three-branch structure caused by the separation of the vibration direction flash and the vertical vibration direction flash. The coupled mechanical effects resulted from friction pressure and friction shear force dominated the formation of three-branch structure. The coupling of welding heat input and metal space shift governed the size of micro pore. Other welding parameters remained constant and there was a critical amplitude, A

84907251512	Effect of different compatibilizers on properties of wood flour/polylactic acid composite	For wood flour/polylactic acid composites were prepared using ethylene glycol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400) as compatibilizers, and t he effect of different compatibilizers on the properties of composite materials was studied. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to analyze the influence of compatibilizers on composites. The results show that wood flour and polylactic acid h ave the best interface compatibility when using glycerol as compatibilizer. Rheological properties, mechanical properties and water absorption rate of composite s prepared with different compatibilizers were measured. When using glycerol as compatibilizer, the slope of storage modulus is the minimum, indicating that the wood flour and polylactic acid interaction is the strongest, and the complex vi scosity is between that of ethylene glycol and PEG400. The mechanical properties of composite prepared with glycerol as compatibilizer are better compared with using ethylene glycol and PEG400 as compatibilizer. The water absorption of the composites is increased along with compatibilizers carbon chain increased.

84911437949	The effect of carboxymethyl cellulose addition on the properties of starch-based wood adhesive	Starch adhesive was prepared utilizing corn starch, polyvinyl alcohol, and borax as raw materials. A certain amount of water-soluble carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was added in the preparation process, and a certain percentage of polymethylene polyphenylene isocyanate pre-polymer as cross-linking agent was used to improve its water resistance. To evaluate the water resistance, three-layer plywood was fabricated by hot pressing, and bonding strength was measured using a mechanical testing machine according to the National Standard of the People's Republic of China GB/T 17657-2013. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize curing of the adhesion. The results showed that the initial viscosity, solids content, and bonding strength of the starch adhesive, as well as the interface compatibility between starch adhesive and pre-polymer, were all improved. The curing temperature of the adhesive decreased, and the optimal addition of CMC was 0.375%.

84920511282	Effect of starch esterification performed by dry method on UV aging properties of starch/polylactic acid composite	Maleic anhydride esterified starch was synthesized by using dry method with corn starch as raw material and maleic anhydride (MAH) as esterifying agent. FT-IR test results confirmed the successful esterification reaction between the maleic anhydride and corn starch. The maleic anhydride esterified starch was then blended with polylactic acid (PLA), and the mixture was melted and extruded to produce the esterified starch/polylactic acid (ES/PLA) composite. The composite was accelerated aging with UV aging box in order to study the effect of this process on aging properties of composites. FT-IR and SEM results showed that prolonging the aging time led to gradually decrease in the absorption peak strength of C-O, C-H and C=O and gradually increase in the extent of damage to the composite. In the same aging time, the group absorption peak strength of ES/PLA was higher than that of native starch/PLA (NS/PLA), and the extent of damage was less. XRD and DSC results showed that the crystallization peak of 2θ=21° disappeared and the crystallization peak of PLA at 16.5° appeared. This indicated that the hydrolysis of starch was faster than that of PLA. With the increase of the aging time, the crystallization of PLA in composites increased first, then decreased. It suggested that amorphous of PLA was first hydrolyzed. Influenced by the crystallinity, thermal decomposition temperature of composites increased first, and then decreased. The thermal stability of ES/PLA was better than that of NS/PLA. Besides, when the aging time was same, ES/PLA performed better mechanical properties compared with NS/PLA. And with the aging time prolonged, the mechanical strength of NS/PLA and ES/PLA gradually decreased.

84920524901	Effects of MAH on properties of dry method esterified starch/PLA composites	Maleic anhydride (MAH) esterified starch was synthesized by dry method with corn starch and MAH as raw materials, and esterified starch/polylactic acid (PLA) composites were prepared by melt extrusion. Effects of MAH amounts on the degree of crystallinity and compatibility of composites were studied. At the same time, the influence of compatibility and degree of crystallinity change on thermal property, melt flow property, mechanical property, water resistance and rheology property of composites were investigated. FTIR results show that MAH esterified starches were successfully synthesized by dry method. Degree of substitution of esterified starch gradually increases with the increasing of MAH amounts, and the reaction efficiency is up to 90%. XRD and DSC results show that with the increasing of MAH amounts, the degree of crystallinity of composites decreases, which makes the compatibility between starch and PLA increase gradually. The decrease of degree of crystallinity and the improvement of compatibility cause the decreased glass transition temperature and the increased melt flow and water resistance. The mechanical properties and rheological properties are affected by the combination of the compatibility and degree of crystallinity. The tensile strength, bending strength, storage modulus and complex viscosity increase gradually when MAH amount increases from 0 to 1.0wt%, but these properties decrease gradually when the amount of MAH is more than 1.0wt%.

11144320364	Non-Fourier heat conduction effects during high-energy beam metalworking	Non-Fourier heat conduction induced by ultrafast heating of metals with a high-energy density beam was analyzed. The non-Fourier effects during high heat flux heating were illustrated by comparing the transient temperature response to different heat flux and material relaxation times. Based on the hyperbolic heat conduction equation for the non-Fourier heat conduction law, the equation was solved using a hybrid method combining an analytical solution and numerical inversion of the Laplace transforms for a semi-infinite body with the heat flux boundary. The analysis of temperature response and distribution led to a criterion for the applicability of the non-Fourier heat conduction law. The results show that at a relatively large heat flux, such as greater than 10
