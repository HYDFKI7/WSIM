23944446690	Survival factors after resection of small hepatocellular carcinoma	BACKGROUND: Early resection of hepatocellular carcinoma is a key measure to prolong the survival of patients. This study was designed to summarize our experience in surgical resection of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to analyze the factors influencing the postoperative survival of patients. METHODS: The clinicopathologic data of 105 patients with small HCC after resection from 1986 through 2003 were analyzed; the patients had been followed up for more than half a year (median 33 months). Nine clinicopathologic factors, preoperative α-fetoprotein (AFP) level, liver cirrhosis, Child-Pugh score, tumor size (>2 cm vs. ≤2 cm) and number (single vs. multiple), capsule formation, portal vein tumor thrombi (PVTT), Edmondson tumor grade and surgical method, were analyzed by the log-rank test and the Cox proportional harzards model analysis. RESULTS: The cumulative 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates after the operation were 86.5%, 70.3% and 55.2%, respectively, and the 1-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 78%, 58.9% and 45.6%, respectively. One patient died from esophagogastric varices hemorrhage in 2 weeks after reoperation. Thirty-six patients had intrahepatic recurrence or metastasis postoperatively and 34 patients died. The Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional harzards model analysis indicated that poor Child-Pugh score, tumor more than 2 cm in diameter, PVTT and multiple lesions (including satellitic lesions) were adverse factors affecting postoperative survival. The Cox proportional harzards model analysis indicated that tumor size, PVTT and multiple lesions were the factors influencing postoperative disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Limited hepatectomy with a margin more than 1 cm is an appropriate surgical approach. Adverse preoperative Child-Pugh score and postoperative intrahepatic recurrences are the main factors leading to the death of patients with small HCC. © 2005, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

28444439938	The Chinese classification system compared with TNM staging in prognosis of patients with primary hepatic carcinoma after resection	Background: The life expectancy of a patient with primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC) is hard to predict, and it is related to many prognostic factors. The Chinese classification system including five parameters: tumor, vascular thrombosis, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and Child-Pugh stage developed in 1999 was adopted by the 8th National Conference on Liver Cancer of the Chinese Anti-Cancer Association in 2001. In this study, the discriminatory ability of the Chinese classification system was compared with that of the TNM staging in patients for resection of PHC, in addition to the evaluation of prognostic value. Methods: The data of 246 patients who had undergone resection of PHC from January 1986 to December 2000 (average age, 51 years; male/female ratio, 213/33) were retrospectively studied. Among the 246 patients, 227 were followed up for at least 3 years. Results: The 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-year tumor-free survival rates were 55%, 30%, 25%, 20% and 18%, respectively. The Chinese classification system was better than the TNM staging system in predicting survival rate of patients with PHC, as confirmed by survival curves shown by the Kaplain-Meier method. The mean survival time was 155, 70, 39, 16, and 4 months in patients with the Chinese classification stages Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb, and III, respectively. The 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-year tumor-free survival rates of the Chinese classification system and TNM staging were statistically significant and had a slightly positive relationship. The predictive capacity of the Chinese classification system was confirmed in any two subgroups of patients undergoing operation. COX proportional hazards regression analysis showed that the Chinese classification system was the only independent prognostic factor for survival. Conclusions: Taking both tumor extension and liver function into account, we consider that the Chinese classification system making up for the deficiency of UICC TNM staging is more precise in predicting the prognosis of patients with resection of PHC. © 2005, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

33644532832	Recent advances in heat shock protein-based cancer vaccines	Background: Active immunotherapy has been successful in preventing many infectious diseases, and is being explored for its anti-tumor use. Purified antigens, peptides, gene-based systems and antigens contained in whole cells or cell lysates are used in specific active immunotherapy for cancer, known as cancer vaccines. Cancer vaccines do not directly kill tumor cells, but prime a specific humoral and/or cellular immune response against the tumor. Up to date, many kinds of cancer vaccines have been tested in the world and have shown their own advantages. Heat shock protein (HSP)-based cancer vaccine is one of the outstanding representatives. In this paper, we review recent advances in HSP-based cancer vaccines. Data sources: An English-language literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (1990-2005) on HSP, cancer vaccines and other related subjects. Results: Several kinds of HSP-based cancer vaccines which have been explored worldwide, include tumor derived HSP-peptide complex cancer vaccines, artificially reconstituted HSP-peptide complex cancer vaccines, HSP-peptide fusion protein cancer vaccines and HSP-based DNA cancer vaccines, etc. Many HSP-based cancer vaccines are being tested in clinical trials, and some are being tested in phase III clinical trials at present. Conclusion: The available results in preclinical tests and clinical trials indicate that HSP-based cancer vaccines are promising in cancer therapy. © 2006, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

33645536935	Apoptosis induced by preoperative oral 5′-DFUR administration in gastric adenocarcinoma and its mechanism of action	Aim: To study the apoptosis induced by preoperative oral 5′-DFUR administration in gastric adenocarcinoma and its mechanism of action. Methods: Sixty gastric cancer patients were divided randomly into three groups (20 each group) before operation: group one: 5′-DFUR oral administration at the dose of 800-1200mg/d for 3 - 5 d, group two: 500mg 5-FU + 200 mg/d CF by venous drip for 3 - 5 d, group three (control group). One or two days after chemotherapy, the patients were operated. Fas/FasL, PD-ECGF and PCNA were examined by immunohistochemistry and apoptotic tumor cells were detected by in situ TUNEL method. Fifty-four patients received gastrectomy, including 12 palliative resections and 42 radical resections. Six patients were excluded. Finally 18 cases in 5′-DFUR group, 16 cases in CF + 5-FU group, and 20 cases in control group were analyzed. Results: There was no significant difference in patient mean age, gender, white blood cell count, haematoglobin (HB), thromboplastin, perioperative complication incidence, radical or palliation resection, invasion depth (T), lymphonode involvement (N), metastasis (M) and TNM staging among the three groups. However, the PCNA index (PI) in 5′-DFUR group (40.51 ± 12.62) and 5-FU + CF group (41.12 ± 15.26) was significantly lower than that in control group (58.33 ± 15.69) (F = 9.083, P = 0.000). The apoptotic index (AI) in 5′-DFUR group (14.39 ± 9.49) and 5-FU + CF group (14.11 ± 9.68) was significantly higher than that in control group (6.88 ± 7.37) (F = 4.409, P = 0.017). The expression rates of Fas and FasL in group one and group three were 66.7% (12/18) and 50% (9/18), 43.8% (7/16) and 81.3% (13/16), 45.0% (9/20) and 85% (17/20), respectively. The expression rate of FasL in 5′-DFUR group was significantly lower than that in the other two groups (χ

33748508832	The clinical value of hepatocyte growth factor and its receptor-c-met for liver cancer patients with hepatectomy	Background: To study the dynamic change of hepatocyte growth factor after hepatectomy in patients with primary liver cancer, and to analyse the prognostic value of hepatocyte growth factor and c-met for these patients. Methods: Thirty-one consecutive patients undergoing partial hepatectomy for liver cancer were studied. Serum hepatocyte growth factor level was determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit before and after operation, respectively. C-met protein and MRNA expressions in cancerous and paracancerous tissues were examined by immunohistochemical and RT-PCR methods, respectively. The correlations between clinical-pathologic parameters and the expressions of hepatocyte growth factor in serum and c-met in cancerous tissues were analysed, respectively. Results: Liver cancer patients had a significantly higher level of serum hepatocyte growth factor than normal controls (1.0424 ± 0.498 ng/ml versus 0.685 ± 0.115 ng/ml, p = 0.008). Serum hepatocyte growth factor level was positively affected by tumour size, node cirrhosis, portal vein tumour thrombi, cholangiocarcinoma (including combined hepatocellular carcinoma), poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma and tumour recurrence or metastases. After hepatectomy, serum hepatocyte growth factor level peaked on the third postoperative day, and then declined, but did not return to normal level on the postoperative day 10. From the preoperative day to postoperative day 10, the level of serum hepatocyte growth factor had a decrease of percent (85.33 ± 10.2%) in the group with large tumours (>5 cm), but an elevation of percent (121.9 ± 10.3%) in the group with small tumours (≤5 cm). From the preoperative day to postoperative day 3, the level of serum hepatocyte growth factor had a higher elevation in the group with major resection than in the group with local resection (p = 0.016). Moderately or strongly positive expression of c-met protein was observed in 27 cancerous regions (27/31), and only in 5 paracancerous regions. The intensive expression of c-met MRNA was 100% (31/31) detectable in the cancerous tissues, but only 22.6% (7/31) in the paracancerous tissues. C-met protein expression in cancerous tissues was correlated with portal vein tumour thrombi, cholangiocarcinoma and tumour recurrence or metastases, and the expression in paracancerous tissues was correlated with node cirrhosis. No significant correlation was observed between the hepatocyte growth factor in serum and c-met in cancerous tissues. Conclusion: The over-expressions of the hepatocyte growth factor and c-met indicates an adverse prognosis for patients with liver cancer. The sustained high level of serum hepatocyte growth factor after hepatectomy may be a factor related to early tumour recurrence and metastasis. Liver regeneration may be a main factor leading to high level of serum hepatocyte growth factor in early postoperative stage. © 2006 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

35448932398	Effects of matrine on the proliferation and apoptosis induction in human malignant melanoma cell line A375	OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of matrine on cellular proliferation and apoptosis in human malignant melanoma cell line A375 in vitro. METHODS The A375 cells were cultured with different concentrations of matrine. The inhibition of cellular proliferation was determined by measuring ÌÔÃ dye absorption of the living cells. The apoptosis was assessed by the Annexin-V-FIFT/ PI affinity assay. The morphological changes of A375 cells were observed by light and electron microscopy. RESULTS Matrine significantly inhibited the proliferation of A375 cells in a dose-and time-dependented manner. The outcome of flow cytometry showed that matrine induced more Annexin-V stained cells in a dose-dependented manner, which was proved by light and electron microscopy. CONCLUSION Matrine plays an inhibitory role in the tumor cell proliferation and induces the cell apoptosis in malignant melanoma cells.

39049155384	BRCA1/2 associated hereditary breast cancer	Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women today. Some of the patients are hereditary, with a large proportion characterized by mutation in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes. In this review, we provide an overview of these two genes, focusing on their relationship with hereditary breast cancers. BRCA1/2 associated hereditary breast cancers have unique features that differ from the general breast cancers, including alterations in cellular molecules, pathological bases, biological behavior, and a different prevention strategy. But the outcome of BRCA1/2 associated hereditary breast cancers still remains controversial; further studies are needed to elucidate the nature of BRCA1/2 associated hereditary breast cancers. © Springer-Verlag 2008.

77954254816	Advances in Combination of Antiangiogenic Agents Targeting VEGF-binding and Conventional Chemotherapy and Radiation for Cancer Treatment	Despite great efforts and resources being devoted to treatment, the incidence and mortality of numerous cancers have not decreased in recent decades. This is a result of the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents and radio-therapy. The development of antiangiogenic agents that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) provides a new option for treatment of cancer. Major advances have been achieved with cancer therapy based on antiangiogenic VEGF-targeted agents in the past few years, and some of the recently approved therapies are now being used in daily clinical practice. A further challenge is finding a more efficacious combination of antiangiogenic VEGF-targeted therapies and conventional radio- and chemotherapies. This review outlines the current preclinical and clinical cancer treatments using optimized combinations of antiangiogenic VEGF-targeted agents and conventional radiochemotherapy and highlights that better scheduling for the combination of radiochemotherapy and antiangiogenic VEGF-targeted agents should be developed to achieve better treatment outcomes. © 2010 Elsevier.

77954798906	Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery versus the open approach in curative resection of rectal cancer	This prospective, randomized study compared the outcomes of hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) with open surgery for the resection of rectal cancer. The main outcome measures were procedure time, blood loss, post-operative pain, time to oral intake, return of bowel function, length of hospital stay, morbidity and functional recovery. Patients in each group were similar with regard to general status, procedure types and the histopathological features of tumours. Procedure times were significantly longer with HALS versus open surgery. Analgesic requirements, surgical blood loss, time to first passing flatus, time to first oral fluids and postoperative hospital stay length were all significantly shorter in the HALS group. At a median follow-up of 16.3 months, local recurrence of tumour was not observed in either group. In this study, the HALS approach for curative resection of rectal cancer was safe and effective and may offer several potential advantages to patients in their post-operative recovery. © 2010 Field House Publishing LLP.

84861476952	Antitumor effect of FP3 in combination with cetuximab on patient-derived tumor tissue xenograft models of primary colon carcinoma and related lymphatic and hepatic metastases	FP3 is an engineered protein which contains the extracellular domain 2 of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 1 (Flt-1) and the extracellular domain 3 and 4 of VEGF receptor 2 (Flk-1, KDR) fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1. Previous studies have demonstrated its antiangiogenic effects in vitro and in vivo, and its antitumor activity in vivo. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Combined inhibition of VEGF and EGF signaling may act additively or synergistically. In this study, patient-derived tumor tissue (PDTT) xenograft models of primary colon carcinoma and lymphatic and hepatic metastases were established for assessment of the antitumor activity of FP3 in combination with cetuximab. Xenografts were treated with FP3 and cetuximab, alone or in combination. After tumor growth was confirmed, volume and microvessel density in tumors were evaluated. Levels of VEGF, EGFR and PCNA in the tumor were examined by immunohistochemical staining, and levels of related cell signaling pathway proteins were examined by western blotting. FP3 in combination with cetuximab showed significant antitumor activity in three xenograft models (primary colon carcinoma, lymphatic metastasis and hepatic metastasis). The microvessel density in tumor tissues treated with FP3 in combination with cetuximab was lower compared to that of the control. Antitumor activity of FP3 in combination with cetuximab was significantly higher than that of each agent alone in two xenograft models (colon carcinoma lymphatic metastasis and hepatic metastasis). This study indicated that addition of FP3 to cetuximab significantly improved tumor growth inhibition in the PDTT xenograft models of colon carcinoma lymphatic and hepatic metastases. Combination anti-VEGF (FP3) and anti-EGFR (cetuximab) therapies may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of metastatic colon carcinoma.

4444332676	Malignant gastric carcinoids with liver metastasis	Background: Malignant gastric carcinoids are often accompanied with liver metastasis synchronously or meta-chronously. Because of the slow growth rate of carcinoids, patients with metastatic tumors can undergo resection for potential cure or for symptom palliation. This study was designed to evaluate the clinicopathologic characteristics and the diagnosis and management of malignant gastric carcinoids. Methods: Seven patients with malignant gastric carcinoids admitted to our hospital between 1990 and 2002 were followed up and reviewed retrospectively. Results: Liver metastases were found in all the patients, of whom 3 had lesions simultaneously and the other 4 had lesions postoperatively. More than 2 lesions were found in all these patients, except a solitary liver lesion in one. Follow-up showed two patients died within 2 months, three patients in 20, 25 and 32 months after operation respectively, and the other two have been surviving for more than 5 and 3 years respectively. Conclusions: Malignant gastric carcinoids have a high metastatic tendency to the liver. Surgical treatment in combination with other therapeutic approaches can significantly prolong the survival rate of the patients. © 2004, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int. All rights reserved.

50549086419	Estrogen receptor α variant ERα46 mediates growth inhibition and apoptosis of human HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells in the presence of 17β-oestradiol	Background: Estrogen is involved in suppression of colon cancer development and exerts its function via estrogen receptors α and β (ERα, ERβ). The recently identified ERα46 resulted from exon 1-deletion from the 66-kDa full length form of ERα66 is devoid of the transactivation domain AF-1, whose function remains largely unknown. Methods: In this study, we compared the expression of ERα46 mRNA in 32 normal colorectal tissues and their matched colorectal cancer tissues by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Human colon adenocarcinoma cell HT-29, that has low endogenous expression of ERα46, was transfected with ERα46-expression vector; methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation and TUNEL staining were used to evaluate the proliferation and apoptosis status of the cells in the presence of 17β-oestradiol. Results: Higher ERα46 mRNA levels were observed in normal colorectal tissues than in the corresponding cancer tissues. ERα46-transfected cells showed a significantly decreased growth rate than control cells and an accumulation of cells in the G

55349139288	Transcriptional analysis of estrogen receptor alpha variant mRNAs in colorectal cancers and their matched normal colorectal tissues	Estrogen is involved in suppression of colorectal cancer development and exerts its function via estrogen receptors α, β and their splicing variants. Whether the recently indentified ER-α splicing variants, ER-α36 and ER-α46, play a role in colorectal cancer development is unknown. In this study, we quantified the mRNA copy numbers of wild type ER-α (ER-α66), ER-α46 and ER-α36 in 35 colorectal cancers and their matched normal colorectal tissues by quantitative real-time PCR assay, and correlated their mRNA levels with the clinicopathological properties of the tumors. We found that ER-α66, ER-α46 and ER-α36 mRNAs were coexpressed in all colorectal cancers and their matched normal tissues. The decreased mRNA levels of ER-α36 and ER-α46 whereas no difference of ER-α66 mRNA was observed in colorectal cancers compared to their matched normal tissues. Moreover, change in the expression of ER-α36 mRNA level was correlated with Dukes' stage of the tumor and the lymph node metastasis. ER-α36 mRNA was decreased significantly in Dukes' C + D compared to Dukes' A + B stage tumors (P = 0.017), and the expression of ER-α36 mRNA in N

61449159996	Fossa trochanterica of the proximal femur in rabbits: An anatomic structure for potential misinterpretation on magnetic resonance images	Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been increasingly used as an investigational tool for assessing the structure and function of animal skeletal disease models. However, to date, MRI tomographic knowledge of laboratory animal skeletal anatomy and pathology remains limited. Purpose: To demonstrate that fossa trochanterica of the proximal femur in rabbits can potentially be misinterpreted as a bone lesion on MR images. Material and Methods: Twenty 28-30-week-old male New Zealand white rabbits were used in the study. Corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis induction was carried out with a combined administration of lipopolysaccharide and methylprednisolone. In this animal model, it is known that osteonecrosis commonly occurs in the proximal femur. MRI at 1.5T was performed before osteonecrosis induction, and at 1 and 2 weeks post-osteonecrosis induction. For anatomical imaging of the proximal femur, coronal sectional images were obtained to align the femoral head, neck, and proximal shaft in a single plane. Volumetric computed tomography (CT) comprised continuous axial acquisitions through the bilateral hip joints and femurs and was performed on one age- and sex-matched New Zealand white rabbit to correlate MRI anatomical findings. Results: In 30% of the acquired normal data sets, a low-signal area surrounded by high-signal bone marrow was observed slightly distal to the femoral head and medial to the third trochanter. This dark, low-signal area resembled an osteonecrosis lesion on MR images. Volumetric CT clarified that the low MR signal was due to the deep fossa trochanterica structure in the rabbit proximal femur. Conclusion: Improved understanding of the cross-sectional anatomy of the fossa trochanterica in the rabbit proximal femur will prevent misinterpretation as a bone lesion on MR images. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.

67549137560	Combined use of chemotherapeutics and oncolytic adenovirus in treatment of AFP-expressing hepatocellular carcinoma	BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which is always refractory to most chemotherapeutic agents may result in poor survival of patients with advanced HCC. Oncolytic adenovirus is a new form for cancer gene therapy via its ability to replicate and kill tumor cells in a tumor-specific manner. In order to eradicate tumors effectively, the combination of chemotherapeutic agents and oncolytic adenovirus has been considered. This study aimed to systematically analyze the possibility of synergistic cytotoxicity of oncolytic adenoviruses in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. METHODS: Several types of human HCC cell lines were used to determine the specificity and cytotoxicity of oncolytic adenovirus Ad5-HC and Ad5-AFP (IRES) by measuring cell viability in vitro and antitumor efficiency in vivo. The cytotoxicity of Ad5-HC and Ad5-AFP (IRES) combined with chemotherapeutic agents were also assessed by the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. RESULTS: Both Ad5-HC and Ad5-AFP (IRES) were significantly cytotoxic to HCC cells with great specificity in vitro and in vivo. The combination of oncolytic adenovirus with 5-FU, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel was synergistically effective for the killing of HCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that oncolytic adenovirus sensitize tumors to chemotherapy and the combination therapy of chemotherapeutic agents and oncolytic adenovirus has an enhanced antitumor effect on HCC cells. © 2009, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

67651251030	Diagnostic effect of capsule endoscopy in 31 cases of subacute small bowel obstruction	Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of capsule endoscopy (CE) in patients with recurrent subacute small bowel obstruction. Methods: The study was a retrospective analysis of 31 patients referred to hospital from January 2003 to August 2008 for the investigation of subacute small bowel obstruction, who underwent CE. The patients were aged 9-81 years, and all of them had undergone gastroscopy and colonoscopy previously. Some of them received abdominal computed tomography or small bowel follow-through. Results: CE made a definitive diagnosis in 12 (38.7%) of 31 cases: four Crohn's disease (CD), two carcinomas, one intestinal tuberculosis, one ischemic enteritis, one abdominal cocoon, one duplication of the intestine, one diverticulum and one ileal polypoid tumor. Capsule retention occurred in three (9.7%) of 31 patients, and was caused by CD (2) or tumor (1). Two with retained capsules were retrieved at surgery, and the other one of the capsules was spontaneously passed the stricture by medical treatment in 6 mo. No case had an acute small bowel obstruction caused by performance of CE. Conclusion: CE provided safe and effective visualization to identify the etiology of a subacute small bowel obstruction, especially in patients with suspected intestinal tumors or CD, which are not identified by routine examinations. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng.

Purpose: To describe pitfalls in interpreting rat knee joint MR images and their histological correlation. Material and Methods: MR scans of the right knee of five 3-month-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were carried out using a 4.7T magnet, using a fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) gradient echo sequence with a spatial resolution of 59×117×234 m. Histology assessment with hematoxylin and eosin staining and Safranin O staining was carried out in the five 3-month-old SD rats and two SD rats of 1 month and 6 months old, respectively. MR images were analyzed by a radiologist, and histology data were assessed by a radiologist and a pathologist. Results: Though the MR images were acquired in normal rats, many signs unfamiliar to radiologists were noted, including notch-like bright signal areas in the epiphysis, gray signal areas in the epiphysis, and fuzzy joint surface of the epiphysis of the femur and tibia. Detailed inspection of the histology specimen showed more unfamiliar features of rat knee microanatomy, including curvy or dipped surface of the femur/tibia epiphysis, areas composed of a mixture of cartilage and bone components, normal notch structure, cyst-like structure, and cavity between cortical lamellae under the joint cartilage. Conclusion: There are a number of normal microstructures of the rat knee joint that can be potentially misinterpreted as arthritic changes on MR images. Recognizing these rat knee microstructures can help correct image reading during biomedical research.2009 Informa UK Ltd.

77950286499	Comparison between analysis of HER2 gene and chromosome 17 in breast cancer by dual-probe chromogenic in situ hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization	Objective To evaluate the application of dual-probe chromogenic in situ hybridization (dual-probe CISH) in analysis of HER2 gene status of breast cancer patients by comparison with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The potential impact of chromosome 17 polysomy in the determination of HER2 status was also studied. Methods One hundred and forty-six cases of paraffinembedded breast cancer tissues were retrieved. Analysis of HER2 gene and chromosome 17 copy numbers using CE-approved commercial kits of dual-probe FISH (for 146 cases) and dual-probe CISH (for 73 cases) were carried out The results were interpreted according to ASCO/CAP,2007 either HER2 gene copy number or the ratio of HER2/centromere 17(CEN17). Results Of the 73 cases analyzed by both FISH and dualprobe CISH, the concordance rates for negative and positive results was 91.7% (33/36) and 97.4% (37/38) respectively, while the overall concordance rate between the two methods was 95. 9% (70/73). Of the 146 cases analyzed by FISH, 13 cases were interpreted as equivocal if only HER2 copies were counted, compared with 8 equivocal cases by calculating the ratio of HER2/CEN 17. Moreover, 3 cases (4. 8%) of the 63 HER2-positive cases determined by HER2 copies turned out to be HER2-negative when determined by the ratio of HER2/CEN 17; while using dual-probe CISH,1(3.0%) of the 33 positive cases turned out to be negative. In addition, when using FISH, there were more chromosome 17 polysomy cases (63.5%, 40/63) in the HER2-positive subgroup than HER2-negative subgroup (37.3%, 28/75) (P =0.002). Conclusions Dual-probe CISH can achieve similar results as compared to FISH, indicating that this technology is a reliable alternative to FISH in HER2 testing. The accuracy can further be improved when HER2 and chromosome 17 are simultaneously tested and counted.

77950915776	Quantitative profiles of the mRNAs of ER-α and its novel variant ER-α36 in breast cancers and matched normal tissues	Objective: The novel estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) variant ER-α36 is reported to be functional in the estrogen signaling pathway and is related to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. However, ER-α36 tends to be a favorable factor for survival in patients without tamoxifen therapy. To investigate the mechanisms behind this paradox, we determined the differences between the transcriptional profiles of ER-α36 and full-length ER-α (ER-α66) in breast cancers and matched normal tissues. Methods: We analyzed ER-α36 and ER-α66 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in 74 pairs of breast cancers and matched normal tissues using a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and correlated the results with their clinicopathological characteristics. Results: Breast cancers expressed lower ER-α36 mRNA levels than matched normal tissues regardless of their ER-α66 expression status. Down-regulation of ER-α36 mRNA was correlated with local progression, lymph node metastasis, and advanced cancer stage. The level of ER-α66 mRNA was lower in ER-α negative breast cancers compared with matched normal tissues. No differences in ER-α66 mRNA levels were observed during cancer progression. Conclusion: Down-regulation of ER-ga36 is associated with carcinogenesis and progression of breast cancer. © 2010 Zhejiang University and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

Fifty patients were randomly assigned to a zoledronic acid group, and pamidronate disodium group. The total rates of efficacy of the zoledronic acid group and pamidronate disodium group in relieves pain of skeletal metastases were 76% (19/25) and 72% (18/25), respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups, P = 0.798. The initial time of effect was 1-11 d (median time, 5 d) in the zoledronic acid group, and 2-13 d (median time, 5 d) in the pamidronate disodiurn group. There was no significant difference between the two groups, P = 0.702. The persistent time of effect was 2-32 days (median time, 24 days) in the zoledronic acid group, and 1-29 days (median time, 23 days) in the pamidronate disodium group. There was no significant difference between the two groups, P = 0.509. In conclusion, the zoledronic acid injection, with a pronounced effect, can relieve bone pain caused by metastasis of lung cancer. The curative and adverse effects are similar to those found with pamidronate disodium.

77955595275	Nuclear localization of annexin A1 correlates with advanced disease and peritoneal dissemination in patients with gastric carcinoma	Annexin A1 (ANXA1) is a multifunctional molecule, which mediates various important physiologic processes depending on its subcelluar localization. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of ANXA1 level and its subcellular localization in paired clinical samples of gastric adenocarcinoma and adjacent normal counterpart. The study also assesses the clinical significance of ANXA1 subcelluar localization in gastric adenocarcinoma. A total of 104 paired resected gastric adenocarcinoma and corresponding normal specimens were collected in this study. Expression of ANXA1 was examined by immunohistochemical staining. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear ANXA1 expression levels and their correlation with clinicopathological parameters were assessed. ANXA1 protein expression was positive in 72 of 104 (69.2%) normal tissues and 47 of 104 (45.2%) gastric adenocarcinoma tissues. ANXA1 staining was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm in all 72 ANXA1-positive normal specimens, whereas 12 ANXA1-positive gastric adenocarcinoma specimens showed positive nuclear staining. The positive nuclear staining correlated well with serosal invasion, peritoneal dissemination and TNM stage. Cases with positive nuclear staining presented more peritoneal dissemination (41.7%, 5/12) than those with negative nuclear staining (8.7%, 8/92; P = 0.007). A logistic regression model revealed that positive ANXA1 nuclear staining had an independent association with peritoneal dissemination (P = 0.039; hazards ratio, 9.499; 95% confidence interval, 1.159-77.815). These results indicated that ANXA1 is expressed in both gastric adenocarcinoma and normal tissues. In gastric adenocarcinoma tissues ANXA1 is expressed both in cytoplasm and nucleus and its nuclear localization correlates with advanced disease stage and peritoneal dissemination. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77955293773	Recurrent retroperitoneal Schwannomas displaying different differentiation from primary tumor: Case report and literature review	Background: Retroperitoneal Schwannomas are uncommonly found in the retroperitoneum and few of them show malignant transformation and invasion. Local recurrence are common in malignant Schwannomas with very few reports of tumor distinct differentiation at recurrences.Case presentation: We report here a rare case of retroperitoneal schwannoma with multiple origins from retroperitoneum and pelvic wall. Pathological examination confirmed the case as a schwannoma with malignant transformation. Radical dissection of the tumors along with the sacrifice of adjacent sigmoid colon and left kidney failed to provide a cure for this patient. Due to tumor recurrence, a second and a third surgery of radical excision were performed 6 months and 17 months later after the first surgery, respectively. Histopathologic analysis identified that the recurrent tumors were different from the original schwannoma because of their smooth muscle-like differentiation.Conclusion: Malignant schwannomas are uncommon sarcomas with a high incidence of local recurrence. Distinct immunohistochemical staining results of the tumors at recurrence indicate their potential of smooth-muscle like differentiation. Radical excision of the tumors may provide benefit for their local recurrences. © 2010 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77955651656	Radiofrequency ablation, heat shock protein 70 and potential anti-tumor immunity in hepatic and pancreatic cancers: A minireview	BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure which has widespread popularity in the treatment of hepatic and pancreatic cancers. Increased evidence indicates that RFA stimulates anti-tumor immunity, possibly through the induction heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression. HSP70 has the capacity to affect the immunogenicity of tumor cells, to chaperone antigenic peptides and deliver these into antigen presentation pathways within antigen-presenting cells, and to activate and regulate innate and adaptive immunity, which makes it useful in immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancers. DATA SOURCES: An English-language literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (1991-2010) on anti-tumor immunity, heat shock protein 70, radiofrequency ablation, hepatic cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other related subjects. RESULTS: RFA has an increasing application in the surgical treatment of hepatic and pancreatic cancers. Increased evidence indicates that RFA can induce the expression of HSP70 which possesses properties that enable it to influence a variety of immunological processes. Tumor-derived HSP70 is regarded as a potent adjuvant facilitating presentation of tumor antigens and induction of anti-tumor immunity. CONCLUSIONS: This review addresses the potential association of RFA, HSP70, and anti-tumor immunity in treatment of hepatic and pancreatic cancers. To establish direct evidence of a potential association of RFA, HSP70, and anti-tumor immunity in hepatic and pancreatic cancers, further investigations should be conducted. © 2010, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

77955924123	Clonal analysis of bilateral, recurrent, and metastatic papillary thyroid carcinomas	Papillary thyroid carcinoma usually presents as a multifocal disease; and tumors often recur in the contralateral thyroid lobe, raising questions concerning their clonal origins. The clonality of tumors appearing simultaneously in both lobes or recurring in the contralateral lobe remains unknown. Accordingly, we examined 25 pairs of bilateral papillary thyroid carcinomas (synchronous or metachronous) and 15 matched metastatic lymph nodes. BRAF gene mutation analysis combined with X-chromosome inactivation was used to evaluate these tumors' clonal origins. Genomic DNA was prepared from paraffin-embedded tissues after microdissection. In total, 62 tumors yielded DNA of adequate quality. Eighteen (18/21, 85.7%) of 21 informative cases showed concordant BRAF status in tumors from both thyroid lobes, being either BRAF mutation positive (12 patients) or BRAF mutation negative (6 patients). Metastatic lymph nodes in 12 patients (12/15, 80%) had a complete concordance of BRAF state with their primaries. Of the 18 studied female patients, 11 were suitable for X-chromosome inactivation assay. Nine cases (9/11, 81.1%) showed the same pattern of inactivation in bilateral tumors. A close correlation was found between BRAF mutation and X-chromosome inactivation analysis. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that bilateral, recurrent, and metastatic papillary thyroid carcinomas often arise from a single clone and that intrathyroidal metastasis may play an important role in the development of bilateral tumors, as well as in the recurrence of this malignancy. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77956021862	Patient-derived human tumour tissue xenografts in immunodeficient mice: A systematic review	Mouse cancer models have consistently been used to qualify new anticancer drugs in the development of human clinical trials. Rodent tumour models currently being used and which include transgenic tumour models, and those generated by planting human tumour cell lines subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice, do not sufficiently represent clinical cancer characteristics, especially with regard to metastasis and drug sensitivity. The increasingly used patient-derived human tumour tissue (PDTT) xenografts models implanted subcutaneously or in subrenal capsule in immunodeficient mice, such as athymic nude mice or severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice, may provide a more accurate reflection of human tumour biological characteristics than tumour cell lines. The ability to passage patients' fresh tumour tissues into large numbers of immunodeficient mice provides possibilities for better preclinical testing of new therapies for the treatment and better outcome for cancer. In this review, we outline the methods of establishing xenograft models, discuss the biological stability of PDTT xenograft models and demonstrate their roles in developing new anticancer drugs and testing therapeutic regimens in cancer patients. © 2010 Feseo.

77957553519	Personalized cancer therapy using a patient-derived tumor tissue xenograft model: A translational field worthy of exploring further?	It has long been observed that interpatient variability in response to anticancer drugs is associated with different outcomes. Oncologists continually hold the desire of matching the right therapeutic regimen with the right cancer patient, which is termed 'personalized cancer therapy. Rapid advances in genetics, genomics and related technologies are promising a new era of personalized cancer therapy based on individual molecular biomarkers. However, these molecular predictors of tumor response are far from perfect. Because of the inherent limitations in the current approaches for anticancer drugs response prediction, the need for new techniques to predict tumor response to therapy is urgent. Using a patient-derived human tumor tissue (PDTT) xenograft model to predict tumor response to therapy might be an ideal candidate method to choose. This article provides an overview of the achievements and limitations of genetic, genomic and proteomic molecular markers for personalized cancer therapy, and further discusses the potentials of using a PDTT xenograft model as a candidate strategy for personalized cancer therapy. © 2010 Future Medicine Ltd.

77957083400	Clinical applications of VEGF-Trap (Aflibercept) in cancer treatment	Angiogenesis is one of the key acquired characteristics or "hallmarks" essential for the growth and development of all solid tumor types. The antiangiogenic agent vascular endothelial growth factor-Trap (VEGF-Trap) (aflibercept), which is a composite decoy receptor based on VEGF receptor-1 and VEGF receptor-2 fused to an Fc segment of immunoglobulin G1 that binds specifically to VEGF, has demonstrated preclinical efficacy in a range of different tumor types. VEGF-Trap exerts its antiangiogenic effects through regression of tumor vasculature, remolding or normalization of surviving vascu-lature, and inhibition of new tumor vessel growth. Preclinical and clinical studies have reported that VEGF-Trap can be combined effectively with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This review examines the main effects of VEGF-Trap on tumor vasculature and on different types of solid tumors, and explores the preclinical and clinical benefits of incorporating VEGF-Trap into anticancer treatment strategies. © 2010 Elsevier.

77958198446	Aflibercept (VEGF Trap): One more double-edged sword of anti-VEGF therapy for cancer?	The use of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted agents for treating cancer has increased dramatically over recent decades. These drugs provide considerable benefits in terms of progression-free (PFS) or overall (OS) survival for cancer patients. Of particular importance to clinicians treating cancer patients by using VEGF-targeted agents is VEGF-inhibition-induced hypertension, proteinuria, thrombosis and hemorrhage. Aflibercept is a new, successful example of targeting VEGF for therapy of solid tumors. Though results from phase I and II clinical trials demonstrated aflibercept is well tolerated, it inevitably has severe adverse effects unique to this class of agents. In this review, we discuss the adverse effects associated with aflibercept (VEGF Trap), focusing on vascularassociated hypertension, proteinuria, hemorrhage, and thrombosis, and further discuss the mechanisms, significance, and potential management of these adverse effects. © 2010 Feseo.

79551545356	Gallbladder carcinoma incidentally encountered during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: How to deal with it	Gallbladder cancer (GBC), characterised by rapid progression and a poor prognosis with a high mortality rate, is a complex disease to treat. Incidental gallbladder carcinoma (IGBC) is defined as carcinoma of the gallbladder suspected for the first time during cholecystectomy or accidentally found on histological examination of the gallbladder. With the increasingly widespread acceptance of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and difficulties in diagnosing GBC preoperatively, the number of cases of IGBC during and after LC has increased. However, management of IGBC is a difficult issue in the absence of established guidelines. Problems associated with IGBC related to LC are the decisions of whether, when and how to perform additional surgery. Controversy remains regarding the effectiveness of additional resection in different stages of GBC. This review gives an overview of IGBC related to LC, and further discusses the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative diagnosis and management of IGBC during LC. © 2011 Feseo.

79952597089	Heterogeneity in primary tumors and corresponding metastases: Could it provide us with any hints to personalize cancer therapy?	Interpatient variability in response to anticancer drugs is associated with different clinical outcomes, which is partially owing to the individual differences among patients. Many investigators have hoped that tumor heterogeneity would help to reveal the underlying mechanism of interpatient variability in response to anticancer therapy. Numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of intratumor heterogeneity and the heterogeneity in primary tumors and corresponding metastases in a wide range of tumors at different levels and have indicated that the heterogeneity might make sense as a potential determinant of anticancer therapy response. This article discusses tumor heterogeneity, focusing on the heterogeneity in primary tumors and corresponding metastases as well as the effect on anticancer therapy response. Furthermore, an idea of tumor-site-based personalized cancer therapy for patients with metastatic malignancies was hypothesized, and a strategy using a patient-derived tumor tissue xenograft model to realize this idea is also proposed in this article. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.

79953873115	Human mammaglobin: A superior marker for reverse-transcriptase PCR in detecting circulating tumor cells in breast cancer patients	Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women in the USA and the second most common cause of death in females who develop cancer. Recently, the detection of circulating tumor cells has emerged as a promising tool for monitoring the progression of clinically occult micrometastases in breast cancer patients. Sensitive molecular techniques, primarily based upon the reverse-transcriptase PCR, using various molecules as markers, have been developed to detect circulating tumor cells. Among those molecules, human mammaglobin mRNA has been found to be the most specific marker for the hematogenous spread of breast cancer cells. In this article, we review the current knowledge regarding the use of reverse-transcriptase PCR for detecting human mammaglobin mRNA as a biomarker for circulating tumor cells in breast cancer patients, and evaluate the clinical implications of human mammaglobin since it was first isolated in 1996. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.

0036674729	Stable expression of antisense hTR inhibits in vitro pancreatic cancer cell growth	Objective. To clarify growth inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells by interference with the hTR component of the telomerase reverse transcriptase enzymatic complex. Methods. A 593 bp full length hTR cDNA was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. 1 (-) in the antisense orientation to construct an antisense hTR expression plasmid. These were introduced into panc1 cells, a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line, by lipofectin and G418-resistant stable transformants were expanded. Resulting stable clones were screened for the presence of the hTR insert by PCR with T7 and BGH reverse primers located on the flanks of the multiclonal site of the pcDNA3. 1 vector. Cell growth rate, hTR expression, telomerase activity and anchorage-independent growth properties were analyzed. Results. Significant downregulation of endogenous hTR was evident in the antisense-hTR transformed cells and telomerase activity was markedly decreased compared to control cells in standard TRAP assays. Furthermore, cell proliferation and the anchorage-independent growth ability in antisense-hTR expressing cells were significantly decreased compared with control parental cells. However, no crisis or senescence phenomena were observed. Conclusions. These data indicate that hTR may be a critical component of human telomerase activity and suggest that downregulation of the RNA component of human telomerase is a possible target for anticancer strategies.

79958813520	Use of complementary and alternative medicine by cancer patients at zhejiang university teaching hospital zhuji hospital, China	Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is garnering increasing interest and acceptance among the general population throughout the world. The use of CAM by cancer patients is very common in China. The referenced English literature has no rural community-based study from China on this subject. This study was conducted to define the prevalence,pattern of use, and reasons for using CAM by cancer patients at Zhejiang University Teaching Hospital Zhuji Hospital (ZUTH-ZJH), China. Face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire were used to determine the use of CAM by cancer patients. All consenting cancer patients were interviewed as they presented at the Department of Surgical Oncology of ZUTH-ZJH, from September 2009 to February 2010. One hundred and twenty one patients were interviewed; 64 (52.9%) were males and 57 (47.1%) were females. One hundred and thirteen patients (93.4%) have used CAM at some time during their current cancer illness, fifty two (46.0%) are female and sixty one (54.0%) are male patients; 8 (6.6%) patients have not used any form of CAM. Chinese medicine (73.5.0%) was the most commonly reported CAM modality. Over 71.7% of those who used CAM were satisfied, only 28.3% were disappointed. Twenty eight users (24.8%) did not see any benefit from the CAM, but eighty one patients (71.7%) could describe some specific benefits. Only one patient will use orthodox medicine instead of CAM in the future, almost all patients will continue to use CAM in the future. CAM use is very common among cancer patients in local area of China. Most users obtain the expected benefits, and adverse events are uncommon. It is imperative that oncologists should explore the use of CAM with their cancer patients and work towards an integrated model of health-care provision. This knowledge will enable oncologists to better counsel the patients.

79958050688	Extranodal follicular dendritic cell sarcoma in mesentery: A case report	Extranodal follicular dendritic cell (FDC) sarcomas are not a common phenomenon. Due to the scarcity of the identified cases reported in the literature, FDC is probably under-recognized and commonly misdiagnosed. The diagnosis of FDC sarcomas is based on node-based spindle cell lesions, and the expression of CD21, CD35 and clusterin. The most commonly involved extranodal sites include the oral cavity, tonsil, gastrointestinal tract and liver. With the aid of immunohistochemical analysis and the two most reliable FDC markers, CD21 and CD35, the diagnostic accuracy has improved. When FDC sarcoma is suspected histologically, immunohistochemical stains for FDC differentiation should be performed to avoid potential misdiagnosis. This case report concerns the evaluation of a 43-year-old male Chinese patient with a large extranodal FDC sarcoma (20x18x9 cm) in the mesentery with elevated serum CA125 (76.9 U/ml). The diagnosis and treatment of this disease are also discussed.

79958068811	Protease-activated receptors in cancer: A systematic review	The traditional view of the role of proteases in tumor growth, progression and metastasis has significantly changed. Apart from their contribution to cancer progression, it is evident that a subclass of proteases, such as thrombin, serves as signal molecules controlling cell functions through the protease-activated receptors (PARs). Among the four types of PAR (PAR1-4; cloned and named in order of their discovery), PAR1, PAR3 and PAR4 are activated by thrombin, unlike PAR2, which is activated by trypsin-like serine proteases. Thrombin has been proven to be a significant factor in both the behavior of cancer in its involvement in hemostasis and blood coagulation. Thrombin is a key supporter of various cellular effects relevant to tumor growth and metastasis, as well as a potent activator of angiogenesis, which is essential for the growth and development of all solid tumor types. This review presents an overview of the role of PAR-mediated thrombin in angiogenesis and cancer, focusing on the ability of PAR1- and PAR4-mediated thrombin to affect tumorigenesis and angiogenesis.

79958171756	Heterogeneity in primary colorectal cancer and its corresponding metastases: A potential reason of EGFR-targeted therapy failure?	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy represents an important approach in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy. However, a number of CRC patients show intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy. EGFR antibody therapy is established in CRC patients with wild-type KRAS. However, up to half of these patients do not respond to this therapy. This phenomenon implied some potential mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors might exist. One of the potential reasons to explain this phenomenon is heterogeneity of CRC. The heterogeneity of CRC has been well described at the morphological, molecular and genomic levels. This review discussed the potential relationship of heterogeneity, including intratumor heterogeneity of CRC and heterogeneity in primary CRC and its corresponding metastases, to EGFR-targeted therapy failure. © H.G.E.

79960326701	Synchronous primary carcinomas of the rectum and prostate: Report of three cases	Multiple primary tumors (MPT) are a well-known phenomenon. Rapid advancements in diagnostics and therapeutics have contributed to a significant improvement in the survival rates of cancer patients, and also in an increase in the incidence of cases with multiple primary neoplasms, such as synchronous primary carcinomas of the rectum and prostate. We present a case history of a small number of male patients with synchronous primary carcinomas of the rectum and prostate. Two of the three cases were treated with lower anterior resection (LAR) and radical retropublic prostatectomy (RRP) during the same operation, and 1 case was treated with abdominoperineal resection (APR) and RRP during the same operation. No significant complications occurred during these operations. Our experience with these 3 cases of synchronous primary carcinomas of the rectum and prostate indicated that LAR or APR and RRP can safely be performed in a single operation.

79961039210	Mechanisms of RON-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in MDCK cells through the MAPK pathway	The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved in neoplastic metastasis, and the RON protein may be involved. In the present study, we determined the role and the mechanisms of action of RON in EMT in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells by Western blot and cell migration analysis. Activation of RON by macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) results in cell migration and initiates changes in the morphology of RON-cDNA-transfected MDCK cells. The absence of E-cadherin, the presence of vimentin and an increase in Snail were observed in RE7 cells, which were derived from MDCK cells transfected with wt-RON, compared with MDCK cells. Stimulation of RE7 cells with MSP resulted in increased migration (about 69% of the wounded areas were covered) as well as increased activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β; the percent of the activation ratio was 143.6/599.8% and 512.4%, respectively), which could be inhibited with an individual chemical inhibitor PD98059 (50 μM) specific to MAPK/ERK kinase (the percent inhibition was 98.9 and 81.2%, respectively). Thus, the results indicated that RON protein could mediate EMT in MDCK cells via the Erk1/2 pathway. Furthermore, GSK-3β regulates the function of Snail in controlling EMT by this pathway.

79960456912	Prevalence of human papillomavirus in Chinese patients with colorectal cancer	Aim The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) was determined in Chinese patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The study also aimed to determine whether the HPV DNA peripheral blood (PB) assay can be used to diagnose HPV-related CRC. Method Tumour tissue, noncancerous colorectal tissue and whole-blood samples were obtained from 96 patients with CRC. In addition, 32 colorectal tissue samples were harvested from patients without CRC, and 48 whole-blood samples were collected from healthy blood donors. HPV DNA was detected by means of a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using consensus primers, and HPV genotypes were determined by reverse Southern blot and pyrosequencing. Results HPV DNA was detected in 32 of the 96 patients with CRC, and colorectal tissues from the 32 control patients without CRC were negative for HPV DNA (P<0.001). Among 48 healthy donors, three had detectable levels of HPV DNA in their PB. Patients with CRC did not have significantly higher levels of HPV DNA than controls. The HPV prevalence in tumour tissues was higher than that in noncancerous colorectal tissues (P<0.001) or that in PB samples (P<0.001). No correlation between the presence of HPV and demographic or medical characteristics was observed. HPV 16 was the viral type most frequently detected and was found in 33 (94%) of 35 HPV-positive patients. Conclusion HPV infection may be a risk factor for CRC. However, detection of HPV DNA in PB does not appear to reflect the HPV status of CRC. © 2011 The Authors. Colorectal Disease © 2011 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland.

80155172981	Low prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in Chinese patients with breast cancer	This retrospective study investigated the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in Chinese women with breast cancer, and the correlation between HPV infection and carcinogenesis. Tumour and noncancerous breast tissue samples were obtained from 62 female patients with breast cancer; normal breast tissue samples were obtained from 46 women without breast cancer. HPV DNA was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction using consensus primers; HPV subtypes were determined by reverse dot blot and pyrosequencing analyses. HPV was found in tumour tissue samples from four of the 62 patients (6.5%), while no HPV DNA was detected in either the noncancerous samples from patients with breast cancer or from the normal breast tissue controls. Of the four HPV-positive cases, three were HPV 16 positive (75%) and one was HPV 18 positive (25%). The low frequency of HPV detected in this study suggests that this infection is not a major risk factor in breast cancer development. © 2011 Field House Publishing LLP.

82555172199	Establishment of a PDTT xenograft model of gastric carcinoma and its application in personalized therapeutic regimen selection	Background/Aims: Lack of appropriate tumor models that reliably predict response to anti-cancer agents remains a major deficiency in the clinical practice of personalized cancer therapy. The aim of our study was to establish a patient-derived tumor tissue (PDTT) xenograft model of gastric carcinoma for personalized cancer therapeutic regimen selection and testing of novel molecularly targeted agents. Methodology: Patient-derived tumor tissue of primary gastric carcinoma was used to create the xenograft model. After 11 weeks, xenografts were harvested for serial transplantation. H&E staining, immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting were used to determine biological stability of the xenograft during serial transplantation compared with the original tumor tissue. Drug sensitivities of the xenograft to bevacizumab (Avastin), FP3 and cetuximab were evaluated. Results: Xenograft model was successfully established. Early passages of the PDTT xenograft model of gastric carcinoma revealed a high degree of similarity with the original clinical tumor sample regarding histology, immunohistochemistry, as well as protein expression. The PDTT xenograft model responded to all drugs tested, and a higher response rate was observed in bevacizumab in combination with cetuximab-treated group as well as FP3 in combination with cetuximab-treated group. Conclusions: A PDTT xenograft model of gastric carcinoma has been established.

It was the aim of our study to establish patient-derived tumor tissue (PDTT) xenograft models of colon carcinoma with lymphatic and hepatic metastases useful for testing of novel molecularly targeted agents. PDTT of primary colon carcinoma, lymphatic and hepatic metastases were used to create xenograft models. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining, genome-wide gene expression analysis, pyrosequencing, qRT-PCR, and western blotting were used to determine the biological stability of the xenografts during serial transplantation compared with the original tumor tissues. Early passages of the PDTT xenograft models of primary colon carcinoma, lymphatic and hepatic metastases revealed a high degree of similarity with the original clinical tumor samples with regard to histology, immunohistochemistry, genes expression, and mutation status as well as mRNA expression. After we have ascertained that these xenografts models retained similar histopathological features and molecular signatures as the original tumors, drug sensitivities of the xenografts to a novel VEGF targeted agent, FP3 was evaluated. In this study, PDTT xenograft models of colon carcinoma with lymphatic and hepatic metastasis have been successfully established. They provide appropriate models for testing of novel molecularly targeted agents. © 2011 Jin et al.

84855215601	Mechanisms regulating colorectal cancer cell metastasis into liver (review)	The metastatic spread of tumor cells is one of the most common causes of mortality in cancer patients. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation of metastatic colonies has been one of the major objectives of cancer research. Organ-specific colonization of cancer cells is a significant and noteworthy feature of metastasis. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality. The liver is commonly the sole site of metastasis for CRC and represents a major cause of mortality in CRC patients. However, what regulates CRC cell metastasis into liver and the reasons for the liver-specific metastasis of CRC have yet to be adequately elucidated. Recent progress provides indications and a conceptual framework with which to investigate this issue. This review evaluated experimental and clinical evidence to support a mechanistic role for circulation patterns and microvessels in liver, metastasis-related genes, chemokines and their receptors, and cellular adhesion molecules in the process of CRC liver metastasis.

Although JCV DNA has been detected in colorectal cancers (CRC), the association between JCV and CRC remains controversial. In China, the presence of JCV infection in CRC patients has not been reported. Here, we investigated JCV infection and viral DNA load in Chinese CRC patients and to determine whether the JCV DNA in peripheral blood (PB) can be used as a diagnostic marker for JCV-related CRC. Methodology/Principal Findings: Tumor tissues, non-cancerous tumor-adjacent tissues and PB samples were collected from 137 CRC patients. In addition, 80 normal colorectal tissue samples from patients without CRC and PB samples from 100 healthy volunteers were also harvested as controls. JCV DNA was detected by nested PCR and glass slide-based dot blotting. Viral DNA load of positive samples were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. JCV DNA was detected in 40.9% (56/137) of CRC tissues at a viral load of 49.1 to 10.3×10

84861369217	The effect of anti-VEGF drugs (bevacizumab and aflibercept) on the survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)	Significant progression has been achieved in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in recent years. This has been partly attributed to successfully incorporating new drugs into combination chemotherapy. In addition to the traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, molecularly targeted agents began to play an important role in the treatment of advanced solid tumors. To date, two classes of molecularly targeted agents have been approved for treatment of patients with mCRC: (1) antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents (such as bevacizumab and aflibercept) and (2) antiendothelial cell growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) agents (such as cetuximab and panitumumab). Aflibercept is a new member of anti-VEGF agents which has demonstrated efficacy for treatment of mCRC. With the commencement of clinical trials and basic research into aflibercept, more data from the bedside and the bench have been obtained. This review will outline the application of anti-VEGF agents by reviewing clinic experiences of bevacizumab and aflibercept, and try to add perspectives on the use of anti-VEGF agents in mCRC. © 2012 He et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84861413611	Anti-angiogenic therapy for colorectal cancer: On the way to getting better!	Based on the theory that tumor growth and metastasis depend on vessels to provide oxygen and nutrients, antiangiogenic therapy was thought as a promising approach to cure cancer. Bevacizumab is the first validated angiogenesis inhibitor, when combined with conventional treatments, which can enhance antitumor effects and prolong survival for patients with colorectal cancer. However, recent years, bevacizumab and other angiogenesis inhibitors are more discussed with drug-resistance and the diverse test results. Fortunately, antiangiogenic strategy is more than bevacizumab and more than anti-vascular endothelial growth factor. Dozens of compounds that potently inhibit neoplastic blood vessels formation with different mechanisms have been developed, and many of them are being tested clinically for colorectal cancer. This review will numerate the principal antiangiogenic drugs with various mechanisms, recapitulate the information of studying these drugs for colorectal cancer treatment and try to clue better usage of antiangiogenic therapy for patients with colorectal cancer in the future. © H.G.E.

84862907556	FP3: A novel VEGF blocker with antiangiogenic effects in vitro and antitumour effects in vivo	Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical promoter of blood vessel growth during embryonic development and neovascularisation in tumours. VEGF serves as a logical target for antiangiogenic cancer therapy because of its fundamental role in tumour angiogenesis. This study is to investigate the inhibitory effects of FP3, a novel VEGF blocker, on angiogenesis in vitro and tumour growth in vivo. Methods: The inhibitory effects of FP3 on angiogenesis in vitro were evaluated by using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and rat aortic ring. The inhibitory effects of FP3 on tumour growth and angiogenesis in vivo were evaluated in a human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549 tumour xenograft model with the methods of tumour growth regression assay and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. Results: In experiments with HUVECs, FP3 inhibited cell proliferation and migration. In rat aortic ring assay, FP3 suppressed VEGF-induced vessel sprouting. In tumour growth regression assay, FP3 significantly blocked the growth of A549 tumour in the subcutaneous tumour xenograft model and dramatically decreased the vessel density of tumour. Conclusions: FP3 has excellent inhibitory effects on tumour angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, therefore it could be used as an effective antiangiogenic agent.

84862785048	Estrogen-independent effects of ER-α36 in ER-negative breast cancer	Estrogen receptor-alpha 36 (ER-α36) is a variant of ER-α that has been found to be expressed in conventional ER (ER-α66)-negative breast cancer cell lines and human breast cancer samples. In this study, we found that, using immunohistochemical study, ER-α36 expression was significantly higher in ER-negative tumors than in ER-positive tumors although the expression was not associated with other clinicopathological characteristics. We then constructed an ER-α36-specific microRNA hairpin vector and established stable ER-α36 knockdown cells, and found that the knockdown cells were more sensitive to paclitaxel; the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway appeared to be involved in the mechanism. Downregulation of ER-α36 also resulted in decreased migration and invasion. These changes were estrogen independent. Our findings indicated that target ER-α36 may be a strategy for treating ER-negative breast cancers. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84863278106	Antitumor effect of FP3 in a patient-derived tumor tissue xenograft model of gastric carcinoma through an antiangiogenic mechanism	FP3 (KH902/KH903) is a novel vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blocker with antiangiogenic properties. Previous studies revealed that FP3, a humanized fusion protein that combines ligand binding elements from the extracellular domains of VEGF receptors 1 and 2 and the Fc portion of IgG1, has an inhibitory effect on the VEGF-mediated proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and VEGF-mediated vessel sprouting of rat aortic rings in vitro. Thus, FP3 was considered as a new promising agent in treating human choroidal neovascularization (CNV) caused by age-related macular degeneration (AMD). FP3 also has an antitumor effect in a non-small cell lung cancer cell line (A549) xenograft model in nude mice. However, little is known of the direct effects of FP3 on tumor vessels. In this study, we investigated the effects of FP3 on blood vessels in a patient-derived tumor tissue (PDTT) xenograft model of gastric carcinoma, using large tumors with established vasculature. Treatment with FP3 caused robust and early changes in endothelial cells and pericytes of vessels in the PDTT xenograft model. Vascular density decreased and vascular sprouting was suppressed by treatment with FP3. Pericytes did not degenerate to the same extent as endothelial cells, and those on surviving tumor vessels achieved a more normal phenotype. Our results revealed that FP3 has a direct and rapid antiangiogenic effect on tumor vessels, which was achieved mainly via regression of tumor vasculature, inhibition of new and recurrent vessel growth, and normalization of existing tumor vasculature.

84863561243	Differential response to EGFR- And VEGF-targeted therapies in patient-derived tumor tissue xenograft models of colon carcinoma and related metastases	Heterogeneity in primary tumors and related metastases may result in failure of antitumor therapies, particularly in targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer. In this study, patient-derived tumor tissue (PDTT) xenograft models of colon carcinoma with lymphatic and hepatic metastases were used to evaluate the response to EGFR- and VEGF-targeted therapies. Our results showed that primary colon carcinoma and its corresponding lymphatic and hepatic metastases have a different response rate to anti-EGFR (cetuximab) and anti-VEGF (bevacizumab) therapies. However, the underlying mechanism of these types of phenomenon is still unclear. To investigate whether such phenomena may result from the heterogeneity in primary colon carcinoma and related metastases, we compared the expression levels of cell signaling pathway proteins using immunohistochemical staining and western blotting, and the gene status of KRAS using pyrosequencing in the same primary colon carcinoma and its corresponding lymphatic and hepatic metastatic tissues which were used for establishing the PDTT xenograft models. Our results showed that the expression levels of EGFR, VEGF, Akt/pAkt, ERK/pERK, MAPK/pMAPK, and mTOR/pmTOR were different in primary colon carcinoma and matched lymphatic and hepatic metastases although the KRAS gene status in all cases was wild-type. Our results indicate that the heterogeneity in primary colon carcinoma and its corresponding lymphatic and hepatic metastases may result in differences in the response to dual-inhibition of EGFR and VEGF.

84863613073	Lin28 mediates paclitaxel resistance by modulating p21, Rb and Let-7a miRNA in breast cancer cells	Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle for the effective treatment of cancers. Lin28 has been shown to contribute to tumor relapse after chemotherapy; however, the relationship between Lin28 and chemoresistance remained unknown. In this study, we investigated the association of Lin28 with paclitaxel resistance and identified the underlying mechanisms of action of Lin28 in human breast cancer cell lines and tumor tissues. We found that the expression level of Lin28 was closely associated with the resistance to paclitaxel treatment. The T47D cancer cell line, which highly expresses Lin28, is more resistant to paclitaxel than the MCF7, Bcap-37 or SK-BR-3 cancer cell lines, which had low-level expression of Lin28. Knocking down of Lin28 in Lin28 high expression T47D cells increased the sensitivity to paclitaxel treatment, while stable expression of Lin28 in breast cancer cells effectively attenuated the sensitivity to paclitaxel treatment, resulting in a significant increase of IC50 values of paclitaxel. Transfection with Lin28 also significantly inhibited paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. We also found that Lin28 expression was dramatically increased in tumor tissues after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or in local relapse or metastatic breast cancer tissues. Moreover, further studies showed that p21, Rb and Let-7 miRNA were the molecular targets of Lin28. Overexpression of Lin28 in breast cancer cells considerably induced p21 and Rb expression and inhibited Let-7 miRNA levels. Our results indicate that Lin28 expression might be one mechanism underlying paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer, and Lin28 could be a potential target for overcoming paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer. © 2012 Lv et al.

84866023476	Molecular biomarkers of colorectal cancer: Prognostic and predictive tools for clinical practice	Colorectal cancer remains one of the most common types of cancer and leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Although we have made steady progress in chemotherapy and targeted therapy, evidence suggests that the majority of patients undergoing drug therapy experience severe, debilitating, and even lethal adverse drug events which considerably outweigh the benefits. The identification of suitable biomarkers will allow clinicians to deliver the most appropriate drugs to specific patients and spare them ineffective and expensive treatments. Prognostic and predictive biomarkers have been the subjects of many published papers, but few have been widely incorporated into clinical practice. Here, we want to review recent biomarker data related to colorectal cancer, which may have been ready for clinical use. © Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

Chinese female patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who failed at least one platinum-based chemotherapy received gefitinib monotherapy (250 mg/day) between April 2002 and January 2010. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR), and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Of the 40 evaluable female patients, theORR was 62.5%. All patients have responded with one (2.5%) complete response, 24 (60%) partial response, 12 (30%) stable disease, and 3 (7.5%) progressive disease. The OS and PFS were 20 months (95% CI: 11.9-28 months) and 13 months (95% CI: 8.0-17.9 months), respectively. Survival (OS and PFS) were longer in patients with good performance status and in patients older than 65 years (P<0.05). The most frequently observed toxicities were rash/dry skin (80%), diarrhea (42.5%), and vomiting/anorexia (32.5%). Four patients developed grade 3 toxicities (rash and diarrhea) but did not require either dose reduction or discontinuation.

0037868149	Can inhibition of telomerase increase pancreatic cancer cell's susceptibility to chemotherapeutic reagents?	Objectives: To clarify the inhibition of pancreatic cancer cells by interference with the hTR component of the telomerase reverse transcriptase enzymatic complex and evaluate susceptibility of antisense hTR pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapeutic reagents. Methods: A 593 bp of full length hTR cDNA was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. 1 (-) in antisense orientation to construct an antisense hTR expression plasmid. The plasmids were introduced into Pancl cells, a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line, by lipofectin, and G418-resistant stable transformants were expanded. Resulting stable clones were screened for the presence of hTR insert by PCR with T7 and BGH reverse primers located on the flanks of the multiclonal site of pcDNA3. 1 vector. Cell growth rate, hTR expression, telomerase activity, and anchorage-independent growth property were analyzed. Finally, susceptibility of antisense hTR cells to chemotherapeutic reagents was evaluated. Results: Significant downregulation of endogenous hTR was evident in the antisense-hTR transformed cells, and telomerase activity was markedly decreased compared to control cells in standard TRAP assays. Furthermore, the proliferation and the anchorage-independent growth ability in antisense-hTR expressing cells were significantly decreased compared with the control parental cells. However, no crisis or senescence phenomena was observed. Antisense hTR appears to increase Pancl cell's susceptibility to chemotherapeutic reagent cDDP, but not to differentiation reagent DMSO, COX2 inhibitor sulinbac, NS-398, curcumin, and chemotherapeutic reagent adriamycin(ADM). Conclusions: These data indicate that hTR is probably a critical component of human telomerase activity and that downregulation of the RNA component of human telomerase is an effective target for anticancer strategy and antisense hTR can increase Pancl cell's susceptibility to cDDP.

84866460178	Heterogeneity between primary colon carcinoma and paired lymphatic and hepatic metastases	Heterogeneity is one of the recognized characteristics of human tumors, and occurs on multiple levels in a wide range of tumors. A number of studies have focused on the heterogeneity found in primary tumors and related metastases with the consideration that the evaluation of metastatic rather than primary sites could be of clinical relevance. Numerous studies have demonstrated particularly high rates of heterogeneity between primary colorectal tumors and their paired lymphatic and hepatic metastases. It has also been proposed that the heterogeneity between primary colon carcinomas and their paired lymphatic and hepatic metastases may result in different responses to anticancer therapies. The heterogeneity in primary colon carcinoma and corresponding metastases by genome-wide gene expression analysis has not been extensively studied. In the present study, we investigated the differentially expressed genes between a primary colon carcinoma specimen (obtained from a 40-year-old female colon carcinoma patient with lymphatic and hepatic metastases) and its paired lymphatic and hepatic metastases by genome-wide gene expression analysis using GeneChip HGU133Plus2.0 expression arrays. Our results demonstrate that genome-wide gene expression varies between primary colon carcinoma and its paired lymphatic and hepatic metastases.

84866890020	Prognostic significance of solitary lymph node metastasis in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of middle thoracic esophagus	Background: The aim of this study is to compare clinical outcomes between patients with solitary lymph node metastasis and node-negative (N0) patients in squamous cell carcinoma of the middle thoracic esophagus.Methods: A series of 135 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the middle thoracic esophagus were retrospectively investigated. There were 33 patients with solitary lymph node metastasis and 102 N0 patients. Skip metastasis in 33 patients with solitary lymph node metastasis was defined according to three criteria: Japanese Society for Esophageal Disease (JSED), American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC), and the anatomical compartment.Results: In 33 patients with solitary lymph node metastasis, skip metastasis was shown in 13, 23, and 8 patients according JSED, AJCC and anatomical compartment respectively. The 5-year survival rates for N0 patients and patients with solitary lymph node metastasis were 58% and 32% respectively (P =0.008). Multivariate analysis revealed that skip metastasis was not an independent prognostic factor.Conclusions: For patients with middle thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, solitary lymph node metastasis has a negative impact on survival compared with N0 disease; skip metastasis, however, is comparable to N0 diseases in predicting prognosis. © 2012 Wu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84869483690	Antitumor effect of FP3 in a breast cancer xenograft model	FP3 is a novel vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blocker proposed to have antiangiogenic properties. Previous studies revealed that FP3 is a new promising agent for treating human choroidal neovascularization (CNV)-associated age-associated macular degeneration (AMD) and has an inhibitory effect on VEGF-mediated proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and VEGF-mediated vessel sprouting of the rat aortic ring in vitro. Previous studies have also revealed that FP3 has antitumor effects and antiangiogenic effects in a non-small cell lung cancer cell line (A549), as well as in patient-derived tumor tissue xenograft models of gastric cancer and colon carcinoma with lymphatic and hepatic metastases in nude mice. In the present study, the antitumor effect of FP3 in an MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenograft model was investigated. Treatment with FP3 for 3 weeks significantly suppressed xenograft growth and this inhibition was associated with a significant decrease in angiogenesis and direct inhibition of tumor cells. The results of the present study indicate that FP3 inhibits breast cancer tumor growth via the indirect inhibition of angiogenesis as well as a direct effect on tumor cells.

84873539190	Surgical management of retrorectal tumors: A retrospective study of a 9-year experience in a single institution	Background: The relative rarity and anatomical position of retrorectal tumors may lead to difficulty in diagnosis and surgical management. Methods: This was a retrospective review of 62 patients who had resection of retrorectal tumors between 2002 and 2010. Results: All patients in this study were treated by excision of the retrorectal tumors. Surgical approach included transsacral approach (52 cases), transabdominal approach (eight cases), and combined approach (two cases). A total of 48 benign lesions (77.4%) and 14 malignant lesions (22.6%) were confirmed by histological examination. The 48 benign cases included dermoid cysts (17 cases), simple cysts (eight cases), teratomas (eight cases), neurofibromas (eight cases), fibrolipomas (four cases), neurilemmomas (two cases), and synovioma (one case). The 14 malignant cases included lymphomas (four cases), malignant teratomas (three cases), fibrosarcomas (two cases), interstitialomas (four cases) and malignant mesothelioma (one case). Complications occurred in 14.5% of patients and included intraoperative bleeding (three cases), rectal injury (three cases), and presacral infection (three cases). Conclusion: Primary retrorectal tumors are very rare. Successful treatment of these tumors requires extensive knowledge of pelvic anatomy and expertise in pelvic surgery. © 2011 Lin et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84877667256	Clinical features and prognosis of patients with benign thyroid disease accompanied by an incidental papillary carcinoma	Purpose: To investigate the clinical features and prognosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with a background of benign disease. Method: A total of 709 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma undergoing surgical resection were analyzed retrospectively. In 147 patients who underwent surgery for benign thyroid disease, incidental PTC (IPC group) were identified by intraoperative or postoperative pathological examination of surgical specimens but were not detected by preoperative imaging studies. In the other group, according to the pathological examination with or without co-existing benign thyroid disease, 253 cases were clarified as concomitant PTC and 309 cases were clarified as dominant PTC. Results: Incidental PTC was more common in women, about 85.7%, the mean age was 47.6±11.3 years old. Average tumor diameter was 4.4±2.2 mm, multiple lesions accounted for 12.9% (19/147), and the cervical lymph node metastasis rate was 6.1% (9/147). After radical resection 8 cases recurred, the median time of recurrence was about 12 months (0.5 to 162), there was no tumor-related death. The tumor-free survival rates were 97.3%, 95.9%, 91.5%, and 79.3% in 1, 5, 10 and 14 year respectively. Conclusion: Incidental PTC with a background of benign lesions is common, and the generally good prognosis can be attributed to tumor early detection and early treatment. On the intraoperative finding of incidental PTC, lobectomy (unilateral) or total thyroidectomy (bilateral) should be the first choice, but with a postoperative pathologic finding of incidental PTC, further treatment, such as completion thyroidectomy or immediate lymph dissection is not necessary. Central lymph node dissection is also not needed unless lymphadenectasis is present.

84878115770	Estrogen receptor-α36 is involved in development of acquired tamoxifen resistance via regulating the growth status switch in breast cancer cells	Acquired tamoxifen (TAM) resistance limits the therapeutic benefit of TAM in patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer. The switch from estrogen-dependent to growth factor-dependent growth is a critical step in this process. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this switch remain poorly understood. In this study, we established a TAM resistant cell sub line (MCF-7/TAM) from estrogen receptor-α (ER-α66) positive breast cancer MCF-7 cells by culturing ER-α66-positive MCF-7 cells in medium plus 1 μM TAM over 6 months. MCF-7/TAM cells were then found to exhibit accelerated proliferation rate together with enhanced in vitro migratory and invasive ability. And the estrogen receptor-α36 (ER-α36), a novel 36-kDa variant of ER-α66, was dramatically overexpressed in this in vitro model, compared to the parental MCF-7 cells. Meanwhile, the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in MCF-7/TAM cells was significantly up-regulated both in mRNA level and protein level, and the expression of ER-α66 was greatly down-regulated oppositely. In the subsequent studies, we overexpressed ER-α36 in MCF-7 cells by stable transfection and found that ER-α36 transfected MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/ER-α36) similarly exhibited decreased sensitivity to TAM, accelerated proliferative rate and enhanced in vitro migratory and invasive ability, compared to empty vector transfected MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/V). Real-time qPCR and Western blotting analysis revealed that MCF-7/ER-α36 cells possessed increased EGFR expression but decreased ER-α66 expression both in mRNA level and protein level, compared to MCF-7/V cells. This change in MCF-7/ER-α36 cells could be reversed by neutralizing anti-ER-α36 antibody treatment. Furthermore, knock-down of ER-α36 expression in MCF-7/TAM cells resulted in reduced proliferation rate together with decreased in vitro migratory and invasive ability. Decreased EGFR mRNA and protein expression as well as increased ER-α66 mRNA expression were also observed in MCF-7/TAM cells with down-regulated ER-α36 expression. In addition, blocking EGFR/ERK signaling in MCF-7/ER-α36 cells could restore the expression of ER-α66 partly, suggesting a regulatory function of EGFR/ERK signaling in down-regulation of ER-α66 expression. In conclusion, our results indicated for the first time a regulatory role of ER-α36 in up-regulation of EGFR expression and down-regulation of ER-α66 expression, which could be an underlying mechanism for the growth status switch in breast tumors that contribute to the generation of acquired TAM resistance. And ER-α36 could be considered a potential new therapeutic target in breast tumors which have acquired resistance to TAM. © 2013 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

84880493852	Mammotome® biopsy system for the resection of breast lesions: Clinical experience in two high-volume teaching hospitals	Ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB) is regarded as a feasible, effective, minimally invasive and safe method for the removal of benign breast lesions, without the occurrence of serious complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided VABB using the Mammotome® biopsy system in the treatment of breast lesions. The clinical outcomes of 3,681 patients with breast lesions were evaluated following excisions by ultrasound-guided VABB in two high-volume teaching hospitals. From January 2008 to December 2012, a total of 4,867 ultrasound-guided VABB procedures were performed in the 3,681 patients, who had a mean age of 37.8 years (range, 16-73 years). The parameters examined in this analysis included lesion size, lesion location in the inner breast, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) ultrasound category and histopathological diagnosis. Ultrasonography follow-up was performed at 3-6 month intervals in order to assess recurrence. The size of the investigated lesions ranged between 6 and 62 mm and a histo-pathological diagnosis was made in 100% of cases. The results indicated that the majority of specimens (98.89%) were benign. On average, the ultrasound-guided VABB was performed in 10.3 min (range, 7.5-43 min) and the mean number of cores removed in the procedure was 8.1 (range, 3-32). A complete excision was achieved in the majority of cases (99.7%). The presence of a hematoma was the most common complication following the biopsy, and was observed in 27.5% of patients. The mean follow-up period was 25.5 months (range, 1-60 months), during which the rate of recurrence was 4.4%. The results indicated that ultrasound-guided VABB using the Mammotome biopsy system is an effective and safe procedure that is able to rapidly remove the majority of benign breast lesions using a small incision and without the occurrence of scarring or complications.

84890478318	Prognostic role of C-reactive protein in gastric cancer: A meta-analysis	C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the prognosis of gastric cancer. However, due to the inconsistent results, whether the serum CRP level can be a prognostic factor in primary gastric cancer remains controversial. Methods: We searched Medline, PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant high-quality reports. A meta-analysis was carried out using the included studies to assess the association between pretreatment serum CRP level and overall survival (OS) in patients with gastric cancer. Correlation analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between serum CRP and tumor characteristics such as tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage and recurrence. Results: Twelve reports involving 2,597 patients with gastric cancer were included. Primary meta-analysis indicated a significant association between elevated CRP level and poor OS (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.56-2.00). Subgroup analyses showed no single factor could alter the primary results when we divided the included studies by "number of patients", "max follow-up period", "TNM stage", "treatment" and "cut-offvalue". Correlation analyses showed that serum CRP level was significantly related to TNM stage (OR 2.96, 95% CI 2.22-3.93) and tumor recurrence (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.21-2.71). Conclusions: We demonstrated that increased pretreatment serum CRP level (≥10mg/L) was significantly associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients, either in early or advanced stages.

84892146505	CMET as a potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer (Review)	Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Despite improvements in surgery and chemotherapy, the outcomes in patients with advanced gastric cancer remain poor. cMET is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, and plays a key role in tumor survival, growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. cMET overexpression and/or gene amplification occurs in a significant proportion of gastric cancers. cMET is associated with a high tumor stage and poor prognosis. Several cMET inhibitors have been investigated in clinical trials, and the initial results are encouraging. It has become increasingly apparent that cMET is a promising therapeutic target in gastric cancer. In this review, we summarize the development of cMET inhibitors in the preclinical and clinical environment. In addition, we discuss the challenges of cMET-targeted therapy in gastric cancer and explore possible solutions.

Methods Studies were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Survival data were extracted from eligible studies to compare overall survival in patients with a positive circumferential resection margin with patients having a negative circumferential resection margin according to the Royal College of Pathologists (RCP) criteria and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) criteria. Survival data were pooled with hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A random-effects model meta-analysis on overall survival was performed. Results The pooled HRs for survival were 1.510 (95% CI, 1.329-1.717; p < 0.001) and 2.053 (95% CI, 1.597-2.638; p < 0.001) according to the RCP and CAP criteria, respectively. Positive circumferential resection margin was associated with worse survival in patients with T3 stage disease according to the RCP (HR, 1.381; 95% CI, 1.028-1.584; p = 0.001) and CAP (HR, 2.457; 95% CI, 1.902-3.175; p < 0.001) criteria, respectively. Positive circumferential resection margin was associated with worse survival in patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy according to the RCP (HR, 1.676; 95% CI, 1.023-2.744; p = 0.040) and CAP (HR, 1.847; 95% CI, 1.226-2.78; p = 0.003) criteria, respectively. Conclusions Positive circumferential resection margin is associated with poor prognosis in patients with esophageal cancer, particularly in patients with T3 stage disease and patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy. © 2014 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Published by Elsevier Inc.

84893685475	Antitumor effect of FP3 on a patient-derived tumor tissue xenograft model of rectal carcinoma	Background/Aims: FP3 is an engineered protein which contains the extracellular domain 2 of VEGF receptor 1 (Flt-1) and extracellular domain 3 and 4 of VEGF receptor 2 (Flk-1, KDR) fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1. Previous studies demonstrated its antiangiogenic and antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. Methodology: In this study, a PDTT xenograft model of rectal carcinoma was established for assessment of the antitumor activity of FP3. Xenografts were treated with FP3 or bevacizumab (Avastin). After tumor growth was confirmed, volume and microvessel density in tumors were evaluated. Levels of VEGF and PCNA in the tumor were examined by immunohistonchemical staining and western blotting. Results: FP3 showed significant antitumor activity in the PDTT xenograft model of rectal carcinoma. The microvessel density in tumor tissues treated with FP3 was lower than that of the control. Antitumor activity of FP3 was similar to that of bevacizumab in the PDTT xenograft model of rectal carcinoma. Conclusions: This study indicated that FP3 could be used as an effective antiangiogenic and antitumor agent in treatment of colorectal carcinoma. © H.G.E. Update Medical Publishing S.A., Athens.

84896692642	Indocyanine green clearance in evaluating the recovery of liver reserve function after superselective transarterial chemoembolization	Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) may ravage normal liver tissues apart from the neoplastic nodules which offset the anti-tumor effect. This study aimed to evaluate the recovery of liver reserve function (LRF) after TACE by indocyanine green (ICG) clearance test and other routine liver function tests. Forty-six newly diagnosed HCC patients who had undergone TACE as the initial treatment from January 2011 to January 2012 were enrolled in this study. The effects of age, basic ICG clearance rate and interval time between two assessments on the recovery of LRF were analyzed. We found that ICG retention rate at the 15 minutes (ICGR15) was significantly increased after TACE (12.3±8.1% vs 16.8±12.1%, P<0.01) in all the 46 patients. In particular, the ICGR15 value was increased in older patients (age>55 years, 20.3±12.5% vs 13.7±7.2%, P<0.01). The interval of ICG test also affected the ICGR15 value (≤47 days, 17.8±11.4% after vs 12.1±7.1% before TACE, P<0.01). Our data suggested that TACE decreased LRF, especially in older patients. ICG test was more sensitive to evaluate the recovery of LRF after TACE than the Child-Pugh grade and routine liver function tests. © 2013, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int. All rights reserved.

84896752968	Prognostic value of perineural invasion in gastric cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Background: The prognostic role of perineural invasion in gastric cancer is controversial. Here, we present a systemic review and meta-analysis of the association between perineural invasion and survival in resectable gastric cancer patients. Methods: A comprehensive literature search for relevant reports published up to April 2013 was performed using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Wanfang Data. Studies that investigated the role of perineural invasion with a sample size greater than 100 were included and analyzed. Results: A total of 30,590 gastric cancer patients who had undergone curative gastrectomy from twenty-four studies were included. The median rate of perineural invasion positive was 40.9% (6.8%-75.6%). Fourteen studies investigated overall survival unadjusted for other variables in 23,233 gastric cancer patients. The relative hazard estimates ranged from 0.568-7.901 with a combined random effects estimate of 2.261 (95% CI = 1.841-2.777, P = 0.000). The effect of perineural invasion on overall survival adjusted for other prognostic factors was reported in 17 studies incorporating 8,551 cases. The hazard estimates ranged from 0.420-8.110 with a pooled random effects estimates of 1.484 (95% CI = 1.237-1.781, P = 0.000). There was heterogeneity between the studies (Q = 49.22, I-squared = 67.5%, P = 0.000). Disease-free survival was investigated adjusted in four studies incorporating 9,083 cases and the pooled fixed hazard ratio estimate was 1.371(95% CI = 1.230-1.527, P = 0.000). Conclusion: Perineural invasion is an independent prognostic factor affecting overall survival and disease-free survival of gastric cancer patients who had undergone the curative resection. This effect is independent of lymph node status, tumor size and the depth of invasion as well as a range of other biological variables on multivariate analysis. Large prospective studies are now needed to establish perineural invasion as an independent prognostic marker for gastric cancer. © 2014 Deng et al.

84897480033	APOBEC3G expression is correlated with poor prognosis in colon carcinoma patients with hepatic metastasis	Increased expression of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) in human primary colorectal tumors and hepatic metastasis has been detected. However, the clinical relevance of APOBEC3G in colon carcinoma hepatic metastasis remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of APOBEC3G in colon carcinoma patients with hepatic metastasis after hepatic resection. APOBEC3G expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded primary colon carcinoma and paired hepatic metastasis tissues from 136 patients with liver metastasis from colon carcinoma that underwent hepatic resection. The relation between APOBEC3G expression and clinicopathologic factors and long-term prognosis in these 136 patients was retrospectively examined. The prognostic significance of negative or positive APOBEC3G expression in colon carcinoma hepatic metastasis was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank tests. Positive expression of APOBEC3G was correlated with liver metastasis of colon cancer. Univariate analysis indicated significantly worse overall survival (OS) for patients with a positive APOBEC3G expression in colon carcinoma hepatic metastasis than for patients with a negative APOBEC3G expression. Multivariate analysis showed positive-APOBEC3G in colon carcinoma hepatic metastasis to be an independent prognostic factor for OS after hepatic resection (P = 0.000). Positive expression of APOBEC3G was statistically significantly associated with poor prognosis of colon carcinoma patients with hepatic metastasis. APOBEC3G could be a novel predictor for poor prognosis of colon carcinoma patients with hepatic metastasis after hepatic resection.

84899492867	A superior strategy for single-cell mutational screening via multiplex-targeted QPCR using the BioMark HD microfluidic platform	EVALUATION OF: Potter NE, Ermini L, Papaemmanuil E et al. Single-cell mutational profiling and clonal phylogeny in cancer. Genome Res. 23(12), 2115-2125 (2013). A major challenge in cancer therapy lies in its complexity and heterogeneity, with increasing recognition of many tumor subtypes that have different biological characteristics and responses to therapies. To effectively address this challenge, personalized medicine has been the 'vogue' currently. Dissecting the detailed clonal architecture of cancer by cancer genomics, which holds the promise of personalized medicine, has significant clinical implications. Substantial advances have been made in DNA-based, high-throughput genomic technologies. However, current methods are still in its infancy, significantly limited by error rates, low cell throughput, high cost and labor intensive. The study under evaluation develops a superior strategy for a comprehensive interrogation of the complex genomics of cancer cells by using multiplex-targeted DNA amplification from flow-sorted single cells followed by high-throughput quantitative PCR using the BioMark HD microfluidic platform. The platform demonstrated a successful rate of approximately 75%, a highly efficient single-cell sorting rate of 96-98%, a high-throughput analysis of 200-300 leukemic cells, and was able to simultaneously detected chimeric fusion genes, copy number alterations and single-nucleotide variants in a single cell sample. © 2014 Future Medicine Ltd.

84901409244	Relationship between preoperative serum TSH levels and expression of VEGF in papillary thyroid carcinoma	Aim: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulates angiogenesis, increases vascular permeability and seems to correlate to aggressiveness of tumors. Increased expression of VEGF has been observed in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is the major thyroid hormone, but its relationship with VEGF has seldom been studied. Therefore, we explored whether the immunohistochemical expression of VEGF was related to the serum TSH level. Methods: VEGF expression was analyzed in 43 archived PTC specimens using immunohistochemistry, with adjacent normal thyroid tissues used as controls. Serum TSH was measured by immunoradiometric assay before surgery and correlated to VEGF expression. Results: Positive VEGF expression was found in 90% of 43 PTC tissue specimens, but not in normal tissue. The serum TSH levels revealed a positive correlation with VEGF expression, R=0.592 (P<0.01). Conclusions: TSH is a major thyroid hormone. Whether TSH promotes the progression of PTC is not known but the serum TSH levels reveal a positive correlation with VEGF expression. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84901495712	Clinicopathological and prognostic analysis of follicular thyroid carcinoma in a single institute over a 15-year period	Background This study was to evaluate the clinicopathological and prognostic features of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) in our institute over a 15-year period. Methods The clinical features, management and outcome of 134 consecutive patients were analyzed according to the time of diagnosis: Group I (1997-2001), Group II (2002-2006), and Group III (2007-2011). Results As time advanced, the ratio of FTC to papillary thyroid carcinoma decreased from 8.7% in group I to 4.3% in group III (p = 0.000). The percentage of patients undergoing total thyroidectomy seemed to be more commonly used in the later periods - from 10.5% in group I to 21.8% in group II and 18.9% in group III. The median diameter of tumors in group I was 4.2 cm and it showed a sharp decrease to 2.8 cm in group II and 2.9 cm in group III respectively. There was a trend towards a higher stage in patients from Group I vs. patients from Groups II and III (stage IV, 15.8% vs. 2.2% and 4.3%, p = 0.072). The outcome was improved in terms of disease-free survival (DFS). The 3-year DFS rate improved from 77.8% in group I to 93.7% in group II and 100% in group III (p = 0.008). Conclusions The clinical features, management and outcome of FTC patients changed over 15-year period. Patients diagnosed after 2001 had a better prognosis. This improvement was probably related to earlier diagnosis with smaller tumor size and presentation at earlier tumor stage. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84902127664	NMDA receptor-mediated neuroprotective effect of the scutellaria baicalensis georgi extract on the excitotoxic neuronal cell death in primary rat cortical cell cultures	The objective of the current research work was to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of the ethanol extract of Scutellaria baicalensis (S.B.) on the excitotoxic neuronal cell death in primary rat cortical cell cultures. The inhibitory effects of the extract were qualitatively and quantitatively estimated by phase-contrast microscopy and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. The extract exhibited a potent and dose-dependent inhibition of the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in the culture media. Further, using radioligand binding assays, it was observed that the inhibitory effect of the extract was more potent and selective for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated toxicity. The S.B. ethanol extract competed with [

84907154293	Giant appendiceal neurofibroma in von Recklinghausen's disease: A case report and literature review	A 62-year-old female with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; also von Recklinghausen's disease) was diagnosed with a giant, thick-walled tubular mass, mainly located in the right abdominal area on computed tomography, following an examination for intermittent abdominal pain and increasing abdominal distension. According to the clinical manifestations and imaging features, the giant tubular mass was considered most likely to be a dilated fallopian tube associated with infection, while the possibility of obstructed bowel loops was excluded. However, the subsequent laparotomy revealed a giant appendix, caused by a large neurofibroma in the root region of the appendix, which occluded the lumen. Neurofibroma of the appendix is extremely rare, even in patients with NF1. To the best of our knowledge, only three such cases have previously been reported in the English literature to date.

84907227371	Er-α36: A novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target in breast cancer	Estrogen receptor-alpha36 (ER-α36) is a 36-kDa variant of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) firstly identifed and cloned by Wang et al in 2005. It lacks both transactivation domains (activation function 1 and activation function 2) and has different biological characteristics compared to traditional ER-α (ER-α66). ER-α36 primarily locates on plasma membrane and cytoplasm and functions as a mediator in the rapid membrane-initiated non-genomic signaling pathway. Additionally, it inhibits the traditional genomic signaling pathway mediated by ER-α66 in a dominant-negative pattern. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that ER-α36 regulates the physiological function of various tissues. Thus, dysregulation of ER-α36 is closely associated with plenty of diseases including cancers. ER-α36 is recognized as a molecular abnormality which solidly correlates to carcinogenesis, aggressiveness, and therapeutic response of breast cancer. Additionally, special attention has been paid to the role of ER-α36 in endocrine therapy resistance. Therefore, ER-α36 provides a novel biomarker of great value for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of breast cancer. It may also be a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer patients, especially for those who are resistant to endocrine therapy. In this review, we will overview and update the biological characteristics, underlying mechanism, and function of ER-α36, focusing on its biological function in breast cancer and endocrine therapy resistance. We will evaluate its application value in clinical practice.
