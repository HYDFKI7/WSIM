84928399194	The effect of lignin and Sapindus saponin on enzymatic hydrolysis of cellobiose	This study examines the role of lignin from furfural residues and natural saponin from Sapindus mokorossi on the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellobiose. Lignin and Sapindus saponin play an active role in enzyme hydrolysis of the cellobiose substrate. Addition of Sapindus saponin to the hydrolysis reaction increases the glucose yield. In the absence of saponin, the glucose yield is the highest with the addition of 10% lignin. The adsorption rate of the enzyme on lignin is rapid in the sample with Sapindus saponin. Lignin content shows to have no apparent effect on cellobiose hydrolysis with low enzyme loading. After hydrolysis for 4 h, the enzyme activity did not significantly improve when the lignin content was increased from 5% to 20%. Addition of Sapindus saponin and 20% lignin resulted in the highest β-glucosidase activity among the samples studied. In the cellobiose hydrolysis system, lignin, which was only solid, has the potential to promote the enzymatic reaction of cellobiose hydrolysis.

84928084019	Comparison of hydrophilic variation and bioethanol production of furfural residues after delignification pretreatment	Furfural residue (FR) is a waste lignocellulosic material with enormous potential for bioethanol production. In this study, bioethanol production from FR after delignification was compared. Hydrophilic variation was measured by conductometric titration to detect the relationship between hydrophilicity and bioethanol production. It was found that ethanol yield increased as delignification enhanced, and it reached up to 75.6% of theoretical yield for samples with 8.7% lignin. The amount of by-products decreased as delignification increased. New inflection points appeared in conductometric titration curves of samples that were partially delignified, but they vanished in the curves of the highly delignified samples. Total charges and carboxyl levels increased after slight delignification, and they decreased upon further delignification. These phenomena suggested some new hydrophilic groups were formed during pretreated delignification, which would be beneficial to enzymatic hydrolysis. However, some newly formed groups may act as toxicant to the yeast during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation.

34347228166	Transesterified Chinese Spicehush (Lindera communis) seed oil as a biodiesel fuel	Studies were carried out on the transesterification of the Chinese Spicehush (Lindera communis) seed (LCS) oil with methanol for the production of biodiesel. The methyl esters of LCS oil were compared with soybean esters to determine biodiesel fuel performance and properties. The fatty acids content in the seed kernel oil (LKO) and coat oil (LCO) were quantified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry method (GC-MS). LKO contains 95.1% saturated acids (capric, lauric, myristic and palmitic) and 2.3% unsaturated acids (oleic). LCO contains 24.6% saturated acids (palmitic and stearic) and 73.6% unsaturated acids (oleic, linoleic and palmitoleic). The kinematic viscosity, cold filter plugging point, cloud point, flash point and cetane index were determined. The methyl esters of LKO had a higher kinematic viscosity and a lower cold filter plugging point value, so it has better performance in cold weather. The biodiesel of LCS oil has fuel properties within the limits prescribed by American (ASTM D 6751-02) standards, except for a slightly lower flash point of LKO biodiesel than that prescribed by these standards (130°C). Thus, LKO and LCO biodiesel have great potential to be used on a large scale as fuel for diesel engines. © Beijing Forestry University 2007.

34347261034	Structure, composition and enzymatic hydrolysis of steam-exploded lespedeza stalks	Pretreatment of lespedeza stalks by steam explosion has been studied. The results indicate that steam-exploded pretreatment has strong effects on physical features, morphology, crystallinity, and composition of lespedeza stalks as shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared (IR), and X-ray diffraction spectrometry methods. After steam explosion, the cellulose and lignin contents of lespedeza stalks varied only slightly, but the hemicellulose content had decreased from 29.34% to 7.48%. The cellulose obtained by steam-exploded pretreatment had a higher degree of crystallinity than that of the raw material. At the explosion condition of 2.25 MPa and 4 min, lignocellulose is easier to hydrolyze by enzyme than the original lignocellulose. The concentration of reduced sugar in the hydrolyzate liquid increased from 71.77 to 162.84 g•L

34548430466	Characterization of galactomannan gum from fenugreek (trigonella foenum-graecum) seeds and its rheological properties	Galactomannan, a water-soluble heteropolysaccharide, was isolated from the seed of Chinese traditional medicine fenugreek. The polysaccharide was characterized by using both chemical and chromatographic procedures, as well as FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy. The results showed that the polysaccharide consists of D-mannopyranose and D-galactopyranose residues with a molar ratio of 1.2:1.0. The main chain of this galactomannan comprises -(1,4)-linked D-mannopyranose residues, in which 83.3% of the main chain is substituted at C-6 with a single residue of -(1,6)-D-galactopyranose. The galactomannan had a molecular weight Mw of 3.23105g mol-1 and an intrinsic water viscosity of 235mL g-1. Fenugreek gum (seed endosperm) contains 73.6% galactomannan. The viscosity of fenugreek gum at 1% concentration is 286mPa.s (30C, 170s-1). The viscosity of the solutions decreased sharply as the rate of shear increased, but rose with increased concentration, and decreased as the temperature of fully hydrated gum solution was gradually raised from 30 to 90C. Fenugreek gum can be a highly efficient water-thickening agents and can be used in food industry and drug delivery formulations.

40449097268	Structure and property of bamboo fiber	The chemical composition, fiber characteristics, crystalline structure, mechanical properties and thermal behavior of the five bamboo species, ie Phyllostachys edulis cv. Pachyloe, Bambusa tootsik, Arundinaria amabilis, B. vulgaris, Dendrocalamus affinis, were studied by IR, X-ray, DSC and chemical analyses. The results indicated that the benzene-ethanol extractive content of bamboo was higher than that of wood materials, the content of lignin and xylan was 19.1%-25.3% and 14.9%-22.6% respectively. Excepting P. edulis, the content of cellulose in other bamboo species was over 50%. The average length of fiber of D. affinis was the longest (1.861 mm). The length/width ratio of bamboo fiber was also higher than that of wood, and it was the highest for B. tootsik, which reached 142. The results of IR and X-ray confirmed that crystalline structure of bamboo fiber was cellulose I, and A. amabilis had the highest crystallinity index. The differential thermal analysis (DSC) can be one of the methods to identify various fiber materials. After steam explosive pretreatment, cellulose content of D. affinis had increased from 50.5% to 69.2%, the crystallinity index had increased and the breaking tenacity of bamboo fibers was suitable for producing textile products, indicating that steam explosion is an useful pretreatment for bamboo fibers being made into composite materials and textiles.

58249084117	Study on conversion process for furfural residue manufacture to ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation	Furfural residue pretreated by overliming is fermented to ethanol by batch simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) in this paper. The optimal combination of factors (reaction temperature, solution pH value, loading of both cellulase and tween-20) affecting the conversion of pretreated furfural residue to ethanol is found by orthogonal design experiments. The SSF of furfural residue is experimented in a 5 L fermentor, and the data of different phases are analyzed simultaneously. The optimal conditions are as follows: 38°C of reaction temperature, 4.2 of pH value, cellulase 20 FPU/(g cellulose), 0.15% of tween-20 and 10% inoculum solution. The ethanol recovery up to 72.33% (vs theory data) can be obtained in 5 L fermentor. The simultaneous analysis result indicates that the highest ethanol conversion rate appear at 27 h, which is much less than that of other cellulose material. The cellulose content and crystallinity index of fermented furfural residue decrease as the SSF proceed, and the average dimension of cellulose crystallite decreases during enzymatic hydrolysis.

77954688524	Influence of steaming time during steam-explosion on the chemical composition, crystallinity and enzymatic hydrolysis of Lespedeza bicolor stalks	The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of steaming time on the shrub (Lespedeza bicolor) biomass treated by steam explosion. The chemical composition, crystallinity and enzymatic hydrolysis of the lignocellulosic residues were studied. The stalks were firstly steamed at 2.25 MPa for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 min, respectively, and then exploded. The results showed that no significant differences in the content of cellulose and lignin were observed during the various steam explosion pretreatments, while the content of hemicelluloses was found to be decreased obviously. It was found that the crystallinity of cellulose in the residues was increased by 60.67%, probably due to the removal of amorphous district. The optimum enzymatic hydrolysis condition was found to be 46°C, 60 hrs, 80 U cellulase dosage and 5% substrate concentration, taking the raw material as substrate. It was also found that the steam explosion pretreatment effectively enhanced the enzymatic hydrolysis to 84%, which was about 2.8 times higher than the un-pretreated raw material by greatly improving the accessibility of cellulose. Therefore, it can be concluded that the steam explosion is an effective pretreatment process.

84887348604	Effects of tea saponin on glucan conversion and bonding behaviour of cellulolytic enzymes during enzymatic hydrolysis of corncob residue with high lignin content	Background: Recently, interest in the utilization of corncob residue (CCR, with high lignin of 45.1%) as a feedstock for bioethanol has been growing. Surfactants have been one of the most popular additives intended to prevent the inhibitory effect of lignin on cellulolytic enzymes, thereby improving hydrolysis. In this study, the effects of biosurfactant tea saponin (TS) on the enzymatic hydrolysis of CCR and the bonding behavior of cellulolytic enzymes to the substrate were investigated. The surface tension in the supernatant was also detected to obtain information about the characteristics and stability of TS. Results: The glucose concentration was 17.15 mg/mL at 120 hours of hydrolysis with the low loading of cellulolytic enzymes (7.0 FPU/g cellulose and 10.5 BGU/g cellulose) and 5% CCR. The optimal dosage of TS was its critical micelle concentration (cmc, 1.80 mg/mL). The glucose yield was enhanced from 34.29 to 46.28 g/100 g dry matter by TS. The results indicate that TS can promote the adsorption of cellulolytic enzymes on the substrate and mediate the release of adsorbed enzymes. Meanwhile, TS improves the recovery of the cellulolytic enzymes after a hydrolysis cycle and prevents deactivation of the enzymes during the intense shaking process. The surface tension in supernatants of digested CCR with TS remained at 50.00 mN/m during the course of hydrolysis. It is interesting to note that biosurfactant TS can maintain the surface tension in supernatants, despite its digestibility by cellulolytic enzymes. Conclusions: Serving as an accelerant of lignocellulose hydrolysis, TS can also be degraded by the cellulolytic enzymes and release glucose while retaining stability, which reduces the cost of both the cellulolytic enzymes and the additive. As the glucose from the TS could be utilized by yeast, further efforts will investigate the mechanism of function and the application of TS in the production of ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). © 2013 Feng et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84896961708	The synthesis of a novel cellulose physical gel	Cellulose possessing β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) was used as a host molecule and cellulose possessing ferrocene (Fc) as a guest polymer. Infrared spectra, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV), and contact angle analysis were used to characterise the material structure and the inclusion behaviour. The results showed that the β-CD-cellulose and the Fc-cellulose can form inclusion complexes. Moreover, ferrocene oxidation, and reduction of state can be adjusted by sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) as an oxidant and glutathione (GSH) as a reductant. In this study, a physical gel based on β-CD-cellulose/Fc-cellulose was formed under mild conditions in which autonomous healing between cut surfaces occurred after 24 hours. The physical gel can be controlled in the sol-gel transition. The compressive strength of the Fc-cellulose/β-CD-cellulose gel increased with increased cellulose concentration. The host-guest interaction between the side chains of cellulose could strengthen the gel. The cellulose physical gel may eventually be used as a stimulus-responsive, healing material in biomedical applications. © 2014 Jiufang Duan et al.

The molecular structure of the product was confirmed by FTIR. The surface morphologies before and after the polymerization were examined by SEM. By studying the water absorption of the polymer synthesized under different conditions, the optimal conditions for synthesizing the polymer with the highest swelling ratio was defined. We showed that the water absorption rates of the prepared polymers were high, the swelling processes of the polymers showed first-order kinetics, and the swelling ratio of the polymer was pH dependent.

70349246725	Recent developments in activities, utilization and sources of cellulase	One of the latest sources of alternative energy, bioethanol, has been the focus of modern research, The production of bioethanol is commonly restricted by the activity of cellulase. Therefore, cellulase has become one of the critical issues in the conversion of lignocelluloses to bioethanol. This article is an overview of the sources and factors affecting enzyme activity, as well as methods of evaluation and utilizations of cellulase. We conclude that a combination of cellulases from various strains can enhance hydrolysis of substrates. Large enough amounts of cellobiase or sufficient cellobiase activity can reduce the inhibition to exoglucanase activity of cellobiose. Characterization and exploitation of cellulase should focus on a definite substrate. Promotion and mixed incubation of strains can reduce the cost of industrial utilization of cellulase. © 2009 Beijing Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

Hemicelluloses from Lespedeza crytobotrya subjected to five different pretreatment severities were extracted with 60% aqueous ethanol solution containing 1% NaOH, characterized by component analysis, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), FT-IR, NMR spectroscopy, and thermal analysis, and compared with hemicelluloses obtained from untreated stalks. It was found that the hemicellulosic fractions mainly consisted of arabinoxylans and β-glucans or xyloglucans. Steam explosion pretreatment yielded noticeable degradation and debranching reactions, illustrated by a linear decrease of molecular weight and Ara/Xyl ratio with increasing severity.

78650936188	Production of lactic acid by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation using steam pretreated lespedeza stalks as inexpensive raw materials	The lespedeza stalks with steam pretreatment were fermented to lactic acid by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) in this study. Orthogonal design methodology was used to evaluate the optimum SSF conditions that give maximum lactic acid yield. We have investigated the following relative factors, such as temperature, loading of cellulase, calcium carbonate and concentration of substrate. The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature of 43°C, cellulase loading of 30 FPU/g substrate, calcium carbonate of 3 % and substrate of 6 %. Comparisons of different steam pretreated conditions on lactic acid yield from lespedeza stalks were also made. The results showed that lactic acid yields from lespedeza stalks with 4 min pretreatment at pressure of 1.0, 1.25, 1.5 and 2.0 Mpa were 41.8 %, 42.5 %, 50.6 % and 64.0 % of the theoretical, respectively. The lactic acid yield from steam pretreated lespedeza stalks was much higher than that of lespedeza stalks without pretreatment (23.9 %). It can be concluded that the lactic acid yield was remarkably improved by steam pretreatment. The yield of lactic acid from steam pretreated lespedeza stalks was 1.68 times higher than that of untreated ones. Additionally, the lactic acid yield could be further promoted from 64.0 % to 89.4 % by washing pretreated stalks with water, which suggested that water processing is a promising method to remove inhibitors in broth to improve lactic acid yield. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The effect of reaction conditions on the graft rate and gel strength of Gleditsia Sinesis Polysaccharide-g-NIPAM was evaluated. The graft rate of Gleditsia Sinensis polysaccharide reached the highest value with temperature of 75°C, reaction time of 5 hours and initiator of 0.025% (ratio of initiator to hydrogel, w/w) respectively. The gel strength of hydrogel, generated by the graft-polymer using glutaraldehyde as a cross linker, had a negative correlation with the grafting rate of the polymer. The influence of ionic strength and concentration of cross linker on gel strength, contractibility and Equilibrium Degree of Swelling (EDS) were investigated. The contractibility and gel strength increased with increments of cross linker and NaCl concentration, while EDS decreased with the increasing amount of cross linker and NaCl concentration. FT-IR and XRD were employed to confirm the grafting reaction between NIPAM and Gleditsia Sinensis polysaccharide. There was a great difference of contracting behavior between the thermo-sensitive hydrogel and ordinary hydrogel, which was mainly manifested by the temperature reaching the Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) of the polymer. The amount of water released from the thermo-sensitive hydrogel per unit time was much more than the ordinary hydrogel, which was mostly due to the conformation transition of the graft-polymer. It was found that the LCST of the polymer was obtained at 36.5°C, which indicates that the polymer has an obvious temperature dependency and could be used in living tissues as drug controlled release materials. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

G. sinensis gum was extracted from whole seeds using baking, boiling water and acid dehulling pretreatment, respectively. The physicochemical properties of the three isolated G. sinensis gums were studied to evaluate three pretreatment methods. The results illustrated that the properties of G. sinensis gum were significantly influenced by dulling method (p < 0.05) including the yield, M/G ratio, viscosity, chemical composition and molecular weight. Power-law model (σ=k·γ̇n) was applied to the rheological measurements, which indicated that solutions of Gb, Gw and Ga gum behaved as pseudoplastic fluids at the concentration of 0.5% (w/v).

79957792904	The effect of gleditsia saponin on simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of furfural residue for ethanol production	Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation is an attractive process configuration for bioethanol. However, the process cost in SSF is still high. Further reductions in cost are expected with reduction of enzyme addition and the use of waste agricultural or industrial materials as feedstock. Surfactant addition is a simple method to reduce the amount of enzyme loading. In the present work we explore the effect of Gleditsia Saponin, an inexpensive and natural surfactant, on SSF of furfural residue, a main waste of furfural industry in China, for ethanol production. Gleditsia Saponin addition even at low concentration, 0.04 g/l, increased the ethanol yield by 9.9%. Meanwhile, when Gleditsia Saponin addition was 0.16 g/l, the yield was increased by 22.8% and the enzyme activity significantly increased in the liquid fraction at the end of SSF, which would contribute to recover and recycle enzyme. Gleditsia Saponin addition at 1.25 g/l had a better performance in improving SSF efficiency than that of 2.5 g/l Tween-20 addition. The positive effects of Gleditsia Saponin addition on SSF, such as less enzyme loading and shorter residence time could also been observed. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

However, the high enzyme addition contributes to a high process cost. This study shows that appropriate concentration of Gleditsia saponin could reduce the enzyme loading and increase β-glucosidase active. The optimal conditions of enzymatic hydrolysis process of furfural residues was at enzyme loading of 6 FPU cellulose/g substrate and 9 IU β-glucosidase/g substrate with 0.6 g/l of Gleditsia saponin. The enzyme loading could be reduced by 50% with addition of 0.64 g/l Gleditsia saponin during furfural residues hydrolysis. The β-glucosidase activity from hydrolysate with 0.64 g/l Gleditsia saponin was higher than that without any surfactants. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

A maximum glucose yield of 96.8% was obtained when the residue with a lignin removal of 51.4% was hydrolyzed for 108 h at an enzyme loading of 25 FPU/g cellulose. However, further lignin removal did not increase the hydrolysis. The effect of enzyme loading on the enzymatic hydrolysis was also explored in this work. It was concluded that a high glucose yield of 90% was achieved when the enzyme dosage was reduced from 25 to 15 FPU/g cellulose, which was cost-effective for the sugar and ethanol production. The structures of raw material and delignified samples were further characterized by XRD and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

79960877313	Simultaneous saccharification and cofermentation of lignocellulosic residues from commercial furfural production and corn kernels using different nutrient media	Background: As the supply of starch grain and sugar cane, currently the main feedstocks for bioethanol production, become limited, lignocelluloses will be sought as alternative materials for bioethanol production. Production of cellulosic ethanol is still cost-inefficient because of the low final ethanol concentration and the addition of nutrients. We report the use of simultaneous saccharification and cofermentation (SSCF) of lignocellulosic residues from commercial furfural production (furfural residue, FR) and corn kernels to compare different nutritional media. The final ethanol concentration, yield, number of live yeast cells, and yeast-cell death ratio were investigated to evaluate the effectiveness of integrating cellulosic and starch ethanol. Results: Both the ethanol yield and number of live yeast cells increased with increasing corn-kernel concentration, whereas the yeast-cell death ratio decreased in SSCF of FR and corn kernels. An ethanol concentration of 73.1 g/L at 120 h, which corresponded to a 101.1% ethanol yield based on FR cellulose and corn starch, was obtained in SSCF of 7.5% FR and 14.5% corn kernels with mineral-salt medium. SSCF could simultaneously convert cellulose into ethanol from both corn kernels and FR, and SSCF ethanol yield was similar between the organic and mineral-salt media. Conclusions: Starch ethanol promotes cellulosic ethanol by providing important nutrients for fermentative organisms, and in turn cellulosic ethanol promotes starch ethanol by providing cellulosic enzymes that convert the cellulosic polysaccharides in starch materials into additional ethanol. It is feasible to produce ethanol in SSCF of FR and corn kernels with mineral-salt medium. It would be cost-efficient to produce ethanol in SSCF of high concentrations of water-insoluble solids of lignocellulosic materials and corn kernels. Compared with prehydrolysis and fed-batch strategy using lignocellulosic materials, addition of starch hydrolysates to cellulosic ethanol production is a more suitable method to improve the final ethanol concentration. © 2011 Tang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

T. viride cellulase possessed an efficient adsorption-desorption on the substrate and reached the highest FPA difference (0.72 U/mL) among enzyme activities, indicating to its excellent hydrolysis capability. However, β-glucosidase in T. viride cellulase system showed close bonding on the substrate, suggesting that efficiencies of adsorption-desorption on the cellulose are different between the entire cellulase system and β-glucosidase. T. viride cellulase, with active endogenous β-glucosidase (1.60 U/mL), has compatible synergism with the additional exogenous β-glucosidase.

80755133469	Comparative characterization of milled wood lignin from furfural residues and corncob	Furfural residues are by-products from the process of furfural production with corncobs. The cellulose in the residues can be used to produce ethanol, but lignin, the other main component in the residues, inevitably exerts unfavourable effects on the enzymatic hydrolysis process. In order to reveal the effects and make an efficient utilization of the lignin, the characteristics, especially the variation during furfural production, should first be investigated. In this paper, the milled wood lignin (MWL) of the furfural residual (FR) and corncob were separated and a comparative study of the MWL fractions was made in terms of the UV, FT-IR,

83655198140	Galactomannan (from Gleditsia sinensis Lam.) and xanthan gum matrix tablets for controlled delivery of theophylline: In vitro drug release and swelling behavior	Galactomannan (G) from Gleditsia sinensis Lam. and xanthan gum (X), as sustained release materials for controlled delivery of theophylline, were mixed in different ratios of 7:3, 5:5, and 3:7 to yield enhanced release-controlling performance. The polysaccharides content of tablets was 10% (w/w), either alone or in mixtures. From in vitro dissolution test, G10% and X10% matrices released 91.4 and 87.7% of drug within 24 h, respectively. The synergistic interactions between galactomannan and xanthan effectively retarded the drug diffusion, and the most sustained drug release (75.5% at 24 h) was found in formulation GX7:3. The drug release data fitted to the kinetic model indicated the anomalous transport mechanism (0.5 < n < 1.0). Additionally, the swelling behavior and morphological changes of the tablets were investigated. The results illustrated the potential of binary mixtures of G. sinensis galactomannan and xanthan as novel sustained release materials for controlled drug delivery. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84855707032	The effect of lignin removal by alkaline peroxide pretreatment on enzymatic hydrolysis of furfural residues	Furfural residues are pretreated by the alkaline peroxide at different severities to obtain the various substrates with different lignin content. The enzymatic saccharification of pretreated samples was studied to assess the effect of lignin removal in the hydrolysis process. The results showed that delignification significantly enhanced the enzymatic hydrolysis yield from furfural residues. However, the glucose yield improved slightly when the lignin was further removed over 32.6%. The maximum glucose yield of 92.2% was achieved when the pretreated sample with a lignin removal of 56.7% was hydrolyzed for 120 h at an enzyme loading of 25 FPU/g cellulose, which was 48.3% higher than those attained from raw material. However, further lignin removal did not increase the hydrolysis yield. The effect of enzyme loading on the enzymatic hydrolysis was also explored in this work. In addition, the structures of raw material and delignified samples were also characterized by XRD.

84859947460	Evaluation of cellulases produced from four fungi cultured on furfural residues and microcrystalline cellulose	Four fungal strains-Trichoderma viride, Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma koningii, and Trichoderma reesei-were selected for cellulase production using furfural residues and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) as the substrates. The filter paper activity (FPA) of the supernatant from each fungus was measured, and the performance of the enzymes from different fungal strains was compared. Moreover, the individual activities of the three components of the cellulase system, i. e., β-glucosidase, endoglucanase, and exoglucanase were evaluated. T. koningii showed the highest activity (27.81 FPU/ml) on furfural residues, while T. viride showed an activity of 21.61 FPU/ml on MCC. The FPA of the crude enzyme supernatant from T. koningii was 30% higher on furfural residues than on MCC. T. koningii and T. viride exhibited high stability and productivity and were chosen for cellulases production. The crystallinity index (CrI) of the furfural residues varied after digested by the fungi. The results indicated differences in the functioning of the cellulase system from each fungus. In the case of T. koningii, T. reesei and T. viride, furfural residues supported a better environment for cellulase production than MCC. Moreover, the CrI of the furfural residues decreased, indicating that this material was largely digested by the fungi. Thus, our results suggest that it may be possible to use the cellulases produced from these fungi for the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of lignocellulosic materials in ethanol production. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84860416116	Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of furfural residues by mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria and yeast to produce lactic acid and ethanol	In a cellulosic ethanol production system, yeasts cannot be reused, and it is difficult to avoid the formation of lactic acid. A novel mixed fermentation system based on water-rinsed furfural residue was designed to produce lactic acid and ethanol simultaneously by yeast and lactic acid bacteria. The fermentation broth can be used for the production of lactic acid, ethanol, or ethyl lactate, which is a very suitable alternative green solvent. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation by mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria and yeast (MSSF) in different conditions were carried out. Acid/alcohol molar ratios (molar ratio of lactic acid to ethanol) were investigated to determine the effects of temperature, substrate concentration, and mass rate of yeast to lactic acid bacterial cells on MSSF. Cellulose conversion rate was also calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of MSSF. The cellulose conversion rate of MSSF was higher than those of ethanol simultaneous saccharification and fermentation and lactic acid simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. The cellulose conversion rate increased with increasing substrate concentration, while the acid/alcohol molar ratio decreased with increasing substrate concentration. These results indicate that yeast cells could provide nutrients for lactic acid bacteria. MSSF at 38 °C is also apt to obtain a low acid/alcohol molar ratio. A 1:1 lactic acid/alcohol molar ratio will be obtained at a fluctuating temperature (38 °C between 0 and 54 h, 42 °C after 54 h) and a substrate concentration of 9%, while keeping a high cellulose conversion rate and final lactic acid concentration. A probable bottleneck for MSSF and its potential solution are also proposed in this paper. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

The composition and structure, as well as simultaneous saccharfication and fermentation (SSF) of native and pretreated materials have been comparably investigated in this study. It was found that the content of hemicelluloses from water insolubleosubstance of pretreated Lespedeza and Salix was decreased to 5.91% and 11.98% witheincreasing the steam pretreatment time, compared to the untreated water insoluble substance.of432.37% and 36.57%, respectively. However, the cellulose content maintained the same level regardless of the severity. The characteristics of the pretreated material in terms of FT-IR and SEM analyses were discussed. The highest yields of SSF ethanol from pretreated Lespedeza and Salix were 77.53% and 62.79% of the theoretical values when their residence times of the steam pretreatment were 4 and 5 min, respectively.

Glucose concentrations released by T. cellulases were 4.16 g/L and 1.92 g/L, respectively. The contents increased to 13.77 g/L and 6.23 g/L in the corresponding digests with addition of surfactant (12 g/L). Glucose yields were enhanced to 52.54% and 34.16% with the surfactant concentrations of 10.5 g/L and 12 g/L, respectively. The results indicated that Tea Saponin was beneficial for hydrolysis of furfural residues. Tea Saponin could maintain surface tension in a low level even it was hydrolyzed by cellulases, suggesting that the surfactant was suitable for lignocellulose saccharification industry. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84862966380	Characteristic transformations of poplar lignin during the organosolv fractionation process	Triploid of poplar (Populus tomentosa Carr.) were fractionated using the organosolv process, and detailed characteristic elucidation of the obtained lignin was performed to determine the effect of various chemicals and solvents. The chemicals employed were sodium hydroxide and formic acid for base and acid catalyst, and the solvents were methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and n-butanol. In order to study the lignin modification during the fractionation process, the lignins were measured by two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence (2D-HSQC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and thermo gravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TGA/DTA). In addition, the chemical composition analysis of phenolic acids/aldehydes and associated polysaccharides was also measured by alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation method. The analyses demonstrated that the addition of acidic and basic catalyst could improve the purity of lignin by acid hydrolysis and the cleavage of the ester groups and other types of lignin-carbohydrate interaction formed by polyoses and lignin under the basic condition. As revealed by HQSC, the aryl-O-ether linkage (β-O-4) of lignin was cleaved during the fractionation process. Other carbon-carbon linkages were resistant to degradation.

The characteristics of the lignin fractions permit the determination of the influence of incubation time (2-10 min) on the clean fractionation of lignocelluloses. The results indicated that steam explosion at 2.25 MPa for 2-5 min significantly enhanced the lignin fractionation in alkaline solution from 0.47% (raw material) to 16.36-17.13%. However, the repolymerization reactions were extensively conducted at oversevere conditions (6 and 10 min) and partially led to the lower yield of lignin fractions.

84863801985	Organosolv fractionation process with various catalysts for improving bioconversion of triploid poplar	Triploid poplar (Populus tomentosa Carr.) was fractionated with mild organosolv process, and the effects of varying catalysts (formic acid, triethylamine and sodium hydroxide) and solvents (methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and n-butanol) on the substrate's physicochemical characteristics were examined. The data showed that neither the degree of polymerization (DP), nor the relative crystallinity was significantly influenced under the seven runs. In comparison, the addition of NaOH was more efficient on hemicelluloses dissolution, resulting in lower yields and higher glucose content of the cellulosic fractions than formic acid and triethylamine. Correspondingly, the final ethanol concentration was significantly increased from 1.83 g/L to 3.86-5.09 g/L. Besides, a certain amount of xylose (704.4-962.8 mg/L) was released in the hydrolyzates during the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), which could be further isolated to improve the multiple utilization of raw material. This research provided some useful data for the application of mild organosolv fractionation on the utilization of whole biomass, especially for the recovery of hemicellulosic components. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84864480419	Influence of cellulose content on the enzyme activity in the saccharification digests of furfural residues	Furfural residues, lignocellulosic residues from commercial furfural production, generally consist of cellulose, lignin, and a rather low amount of residual hemicellulose. They represent the most promising potential sources of biomass that are cheap and readily available in large quantities. Furfural residues with cellulose contents of 51.92%, 68.49%, 83.88%, and 94.92% were hydrolysed by a mixture of cellulase and β-glucosidase with an enzyme loading rate of 7.5 filter paper units/g and 15 cellobiase units/g of cellulose, respectively. We evaluated the filter paper activities of the digested furfural residues containing various cellulose concentrations. Both adsorption and desorption of the cellulase mixture to the lignocellulosic substrate were compared according to the filter paper activities of the digests. The higher the cellulose content of the lignocellulosic substrate, the higher was the apparent adsorption and desorption of the cellulase mixture; this indicates considerable adsorption between the enzyme and the lignin in the furfural residues. The glucose yield of furfural residues increased incrementally according to the cellulose content of the substrate. The highest glucose yield was obtained from the enzymatic hydrolysate of the furfural residue with a cellulose content of 94.92% after a 72-h saccharification. Furfural residues can be easily hydrolysed to fermentable sugars with mixtures of cellulase and β-glucosidase. Therefore, furfural residues are potential biomass resources for cellulosic ethanol production. © 2012 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84865800275	Effect of inhibitors on enzymatic hydrolysis and simultaneous saccharification fermentation for lactic acid production from steam explosion pretreated lespedeza stalks	The effects on both cellulose conversion rate and lactic acid yield were studied by adding inhibitors, including formic acid, acetic acid, furfural, and vanillin into the hydrolysate of steam-pretreated Lespedeza stalks. The results suggest that formic acid has a significant influence on the enzyme activity and poisoned bacterial cells, resulting in the reduction of cellulose conversion rate and lactic acid yield by 21% and 16.4%, respectively. Acetic acid showed a strong inhibition on simultaneous saccharification fermentation (SSF) process, but little effect on enzymatic hydrolysis. Hydrolysis and SSF were less affected by furfural and vanillin compared with weak acids. The lactic acid yield of Lespedeza stalks rinsed with water increased from 64.0% to 89.4%, and the time to reach the maximum concentration was shortened from 96 hours to 48 hours when compared with the unwashed materials.

84869448205	Characteristics of cellulose from lespedeza stalks steam pretreated with low severity steam and post-treatment by alkaline peroxide for energy production	Lespedeza crytobotrya is a shrub species with properties of substantial biomass and widely distributes in the desert region of China. The cellulose separated from Lespedeza after pre-treatment can be enzymatic hydrolyzed into glucose for ethanol or other chemicals production, which are important renewable fuels or raw material for other material synthesis. Moreover it also can be used for cellulosic material production. So it is necessary to evaluate the cellulose of Lespedeza crytobotrya before its utilization. In this study four cellulosic fractions were isolated by pretreatment with low severity steam and post-treatment with alkaline peroxide. They were comparatively studied by sugar analysis and the average degree of polymerization. After alkaline peroxide post-treatment, the hemicelluloses in the cellulosic fractions were removed markedly. The treatment intensity had a profound effect on the average degree of polymerization, which was increased firstly and then decreased. A combination of low severity steam pretreatment and alkaline peroxide post-treatment is an effective method for Lespedeza stalks to obtain high glucose yield. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The moderated sulphite processes were used to enhance the hydrophily of the material by sulfonation and hydrolysis. The composition, FT-IR spectra, and conductometric titrations of the pretreated materials were measured to characterize variations of the CCR in different sulfite pretreated environments. And the objective of this study is to compare the saccharification rate and yield of the samples caused by these variations. Results: It was found that the lignin in the CCR (43.2%) had reduced to 37.8%, 38.0%, 35.9%, and 35.5% after the sulfite pretreatment in neutral, acidic, alkaline, and ethanol environments, respectively. The sulfite pretreatments enhanced the glucose yield of the CCR. Moreover, the ethanol sulfite sample had the highest glucose yield (81.2%, based on the cellulose in the treated sample) among the saccharification samples, which was over 10% higher than that of the raw material (70.6%). More sulfonic groups and weak acid groups were produced during the sulfite pretreatments. Meanwhile, the ethanol sulfite treated sample had the highest sulfonic group (0.103 mmol/g) and weak acid groups (1.85 mmol/g) in all sulfite treated samples.

The use of hydrolyzed yeast as cheap nutrients and mixtures of cellulosic materials and starchy materials as carbon source for l(+)-LA production was evaluated. Heat treatment (121 °C) was proven to be an effective method to improve the performances of yeast as nutrients for the fermentations using different carbon sources. The addition of yeast hydrolyzate obviously lowered the surface tension of medium and improved enzyme hydrolysis of furfural residue (FR) as the concentration was beyond 10 g/L. Carbon-nitrogen ratio, substrates composition, substrates feeding rate and enzyme-feeding strategy will affect the productivity of l(+)-LA production from mixed substrates. SSF of FR and corn saccharification liquid tends to obtain good yields, when the total WIS content is in 10 % and carbon-nitrogen ratio is about 30. This study provides an encouraging means of producing l(+)-LA from lignocellulosic resource and starchy resource, which could optimize the use of raw materials. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84872816148	The effect of delignification process with alkaline peroxide on lactic acid production from furfural residues	Furfural residues produced from the furfural industry were investigated as a substrate for lactic acid production by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). Alkaline peroxide was used for delignification of furfural residues to improve the final lactic acid concentration. The residue was treated with 1.3% to 1.7% hydrogen peroxide at 80 °C for 1 h with a substrate concentration of 3.33%. SSF of furfural residues with different delignification degrees were carried out to evaluate the effect of delignification degree on lactic acid production. Using corn hydrolysates/ furfural residues as substrates, SSF with different media were carried out to investigate the effect of lignin on the interaction between enzymes and lactic acid bacteria. Lactic acid bacteria had a negative effect on cellulase, thus resulting in the reduction of enzyme activity. Lignin and nutrients slowed down the decreasing trend of enzyme activity. A higher delignification resulted in a slower fermentation rate and lower yield due to degradation products of lignin and the effect of lignin on the interaction between enzymes and lactic acid bacteria. For the purpose of lactic acid production, a moderate delignification (furfural residues with the lignin content of 14.8%) was optimum.

A complete process was developed, and all major operations are discussed, including ethanol fermentation, broth treatment, lactic acid fermentation, and product separation. The effect of process parameters, including ethanol fermentation conditions, treatment methods, and the amount of EFB used in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), is investigated. Under the selected process conditions, the integrated process without additional chemical consumption provides a 1.08 acid/alcohol ratio (the broth containing 22.4 g/L ethanol and 47.6 g/L lactic acid), which corresponds to a polysaccharide utilization ratio of 86.9 %. Starch ethanol can thus promote cellulosic lactic acid by providing important nutrients for lactic acid bacteria, and in turn, cellulosic lactic acid could promote starch ethanol by improving the profit of the ethanol production process. Two process alternatives for the integration of starch ethanol and cellulosic lactic acid are compared, and some suggestions are given regarding the reuse of yeast following the cellulosic SSF step for lactic acid production. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Steam explosion at 224 °C for 4 min was applied to bamboo, and the pretreated bamboo was delignified by alkaline peroxide. Enzymatic hydrolysis was compared in the pretreated samples. Steam pretreatment led to remarkable hemicellulose solubilization (63.2%). Lignin solubilization (93.1%) was achieved by alkaline peroxide treatment of steam-pretreated bamboo at 80 °C for 1 h in 0.88% (v/v) H2O2, whereas only 33.4% of lignin was solubilized when using raw bamboo. Pretreatment methods resulted in a low degree of polymerization and increased hydrolysis of cellulose. A maximum glucose yield of 90.5% was achieved with a combined steam explosion and alkaline peroxide pretreatment. The surface structure of treated bamboo and the adsorption of enzyme on the substrate were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Delignification decreased enzyme adsorption and increased enzymatic conversion. SEM analyses indicated that SE-AP pretreatment disrupted lignin networks and exposed crystalline cellulose in bamboo more effectively than SE or AP pretreatment alone.

84898926942	Enhancement of fermentable sugar yield by competitive adsorption of non-enzymatic substances from yeast and cellulase on lignin	Background: Enhancement of enzymatic digestibility by some supplementations could reduce enzyme loading and cost, which is still too high to realize economical production of lignocellulosic biofuels. A recent study indicates that yeast hydrolysates (YH) have improved the efficiency of cellulases on digestibility of furfural residues (FR). In the current work, the components of YH were separated by centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography and finally characterized in order to better understand this positive effect.Results: A 60.8% of nitrogen of yeast cells was remained in the slurry (YHS) after hydrothermal treatment. In the supernatant of YH (YHL), substances of high molecular weight were identified as proteins and other UV-absorbing compounds, which showed close molecular weight to components of cellulases. Those substances attributed to a synergetic positive effect on enzymatic hydrolysis of FR. The fraction of YHL ranged from 1.19 to 2.19 mL (elution volume) contained over 50% of proteins in YHL and had the best performance in stimulating the release of glucose. Experiment results proved the adsorption of proteins in YHL on lignin.Conclusions: Supplementation of cellulases with YH enhances enzymatic digestibility of FR mainly by a competitive adsorption of non-enzymatic substances on lignin. The molecular weight of these substances has a significant impact on their performance. Different strategies can be used for a good utilization of yeast cells in terms of biorefinery concept. © 2014 Tang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

CBU/g-cellulose for β-glucosidase. The Brauner-Emmett-Teller surface area was reduced during pretreatment, which did not inhibit the enzymatic hydrolysis. Owing to the reduced surface area, the unproductive binding of cellulase to lignin was decreased, thus improving the enzymatic hydrolysis. The degree of polymerization of cellulose from FRs was too low to be a key factor for improving enzymatic hydrolysis. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84919470881	Comparative evaluation of Trichoderma cellulases adsorption on lignocellulose and holocellulose from steam-pretreated Lespedeza crytobotrya stalk	The comparative adsorption of 4 Trichoderma (Trichoderma viride, Trichoderma reese, Trichoderma pseudokoningii, and Trichoderma koningii) cellulases was evaluated on lignocellulose and holocellulose preparations from steam-pretreated Lespedeza stalk. The influence of substrate on the adsorption of enzyme was assayed on the basis of protein content, filter paper activity (FPA) and β-glucosidase activity (BGA) in the digests. The 4 cellulases adsorbed on lignocellulose subsequently, and the enzyme was effective in desorbing from the holocellulose left in the hydrolyzates. Non-productive binding of cellulase on lignin had negative effect on FPA and BGA even after the enzyme was released into solution. Among the 4 T . cellulases, T. viride cellulase represented lowest protein concentration in the hydrolysate solution of lignocellulose and holocellulose (0.31 and 0.51 mg/ml, 72 h, respectively) and the most frequent adsorption-desorption on the substrates within 48 h. Glucose conversions from lignocellulose and holocellulose in the enzymatic hydrolysis operations were 32.42% and 72.27% for the T. viride enzyme, respectively. Energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis on degraded holocelluloses was also performed. Atomic percentages in residual holocelluloses hydrolysed by T. viride and T. koningii cellulases showed high N contents compared with the native holocellulose fibres.
