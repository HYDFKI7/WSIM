84942373868	Accurate ex situ deformation measurement using an ultra-stable two-dimensional digital image correlation system	In situ planar deformation measurement using two-dimensional digital image correlation (2D-DIC) and a fixed camera has been fully investigated in many published works and widely used for various applications. However, in certain special cases (e.g., long-term deformation monitoring of engineering structures, or deformation measurement of a specimen subjected to uncommon loading), it is very difficult or impossible to carry out in situ deformation measurement using 2D-DIC, and necessitates ex situ 2D-DIC measurements for a repositioned specimen or using a relocated camera. To achieve accurate measurements, the error sources of ex situ 2D-DIC measurements should be identified and minimized, and the strain accuracy of ex situ 2D-DIC measurements should be quantified. In this work, the potential error sources of ex situ 2D-DIC measurements are first discussed in detail. Then, to mitigate the errors associated with these issues, an ultra-stable 2D-DIC system combining the idea of active imaging and a well-designed bilateral telecentric lens is established, which is invariant to the potential variations in ambient lighting and the possible small out-of-plane motions in object surface and/or image plane. The established ultra-stable 2D-DIC system is first compared with the regular 2D-DIC setup in determining the surface strains of an unstrained sample. Then, ex situ residual stress measurement using the hole-drilling technique and the established 2D-DIC system was conducted and compared with the applied ones. The results of this work confirm that the accuracy of ex situ 2D-DIC deformation measurements using the proposed system is of high fidelity, and can be used for accurate deformation measurement in practical ex situ tests.

14344265216	Performance of gradient operators in algorithm of gradient-based subpixel registration	Surface displacement measurement is important in experimental solid mechanics. Algorithm of gradient-based subpixel registration as one of the DIC methods is introduced to measure subpixel displacement, because of its high efficiency and precision. But different gradient operators in this algorithm have different performances. First, several existed gradient operators are illustrated and two gradient operators are deduced through cubic spline interpolation of five neighboring pixels. Then computer-simulated speckle images are used to verify the sensitivities of all the six gradient operators. The calculated error and relative error are presented. The algorithm is also calibrated using rigid body translation and uniform uniaxial tension test of metal specimen to examine the precision and stability. The final results show that the algorithm of gradient-based subpixel registration using Barron gradient operator stably gets the highest precision and is a practicable subpixel registration method.

All factors affecting calculation are discussed. The computer-simulated speckle images and rigid body translation experiment of metal specimen are used to verify the accuracy. An optimal subset size between 41×41-61×61 (pixels) is verified while impacts of different correlation functions on the calculated displacement can be ignored. In addition, it is also found that a 3×3(pixels) fitting window of correlation coefficient matrix gets the highest precision with least computation.

26844461952	In-plane displacement measurement by gradient-based digital image correlation	A fast and high accuracy gradient-based digital image correlation method uses only fine search at the integer pixel level resolution and the subsequent algorithm of spatial-gradient-based sub-pixel registration. In this algorithm the basic assumption is the rigid body translation of the interrogated subset, however, this is in contradiction to the real circumstances where strains exist. Theoretical error analysis showed that the assumption of subset rigid body translation in gradient-based DIC and the linear approximation of the deformation mapping in N-R method yield identical subset center displacements. Then four real experiments were presented to explore the feasibility and sensitivity of this algorithm. The experiment of uniform uniaxial tension test of aluminum specimen was investigated as a state when strains exist. The displacements calculated by the proposed method were compared with the ones obtained from N-R method. The results showed that the experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical solution, but the proposed algorithm was much faster than N-R method.

33646869021	Performance of sub-pixel registration algorithms in digital image correlation	Developments in digital image correlation in the last two decades have made it a popular and effective tool for full-field displacement and strain measurements in experimental mechanics. In digital image correlation, the use of the sub-pixel registration algorithm is regarded as the key technique to improve accuracy. Different types of sub-pixel registration algorithms have been developed. However, little quantitative research has been carried out to compare their performances. This paper investigates three types of the most commonly used sub-pixel displacement registration algorithms in terms of the registration accuracy and the computational efficiency using computer-simulated speckle images. A detailed examination of the performances of each algorithm reveals that the iterative spatial domain cross-correlation algorithm (Newton-Raphson method) is more accurate, but much slower than other algorithms, and is recommended for use in these applications. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.

When the specimen is exerted a tensile load, the strain distribution of the specimen surface will be inhomogeneous. The micro-deformation of the poly-crystal aluminum is studied under a SEM(scanning electron microscope), a series of images of the micro crystal are captured during the loading process.

34248390954	Digital image correlation method with differential evolution	A new intelligent digital image correlation (DIC) method that uses differential evolution is presented, which can accurately measure the surface displacements and strains of the deformed object, even which has a rigid body rotation with arbitrary angle. The rotation angle is contained in the correlation function considering the influence of rigid body rotation of the interrogated subset. Due to the extraordinary ability of global optimum of differential evolution, the proposed method can complete reliable and accurate correlation-matching searching in the deformed image. Then the search results are employed as the initial guess of Newton-Rapshon (N-R) method to further improve the registration accuracy. The proposed method overcomes the shortcoming of the general digital image correlation method, which can work under the condition that the tested object has a rotation angle larger than seven degree.

34447256579	Full-field strain measurement using a two-dimensional Savitzky-Golay digital differentiator in digital image correlation	Many published research works regarding digital image correlation (DIC) have been focused on the improvements of the accuracy of displacement estimation. However, the original displacement fields calculated at discrete locations using DIC are unavoidably contaminated by noises. If the strain fields are directly computed by differentiating the original displacement fields, the noises will be amplified even at a higher level, and the resulting strain fields are untrustworthy. Based on the principle of local least-square fitting using two-dimensional (2D) polynomials, a 2D Savitzky-Golay (SG) digital differentiator is deduced and used to calculate strain fields from the original displacement fields obtained by DIC. The calculation process can be easily implemented by convolving the SG digital differentiator with the estimated displacement fields. Both homogeneous and inhomogeneous deformation images are employed to verify the proposed technique. The calculated strain fields clearly demonstrate that the proposed technique is simple and effective. © 2007 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

34548648072	Large-deformation analysis in microscopic area using micro-moiré methods with a focused ion beam milling grating	In this study, the focused ion beam (FIB) milling method is applied to fabricate sub-micron grating on TiNi shape memory alloy materials. With self-made FIB milling gratings, scanning electron microscope (SEM) micro-moiré and digital moiré methods are successfully used to measure large deformation of porous TiNi shape memory alloys (SMA) in uni-axial compressive tests. The principles of the SEM micro-moiré method and digital moiré method are introduced, and applied to calculate large strain. The full field deformation around shear bands can be measured precisely. During the investigation, the phenomenon of furcated moiré fringes was found, and a corresponding explanation is given in this paper. The furcated fringes are generated in the locations of combined shear bands where sudden changes of strain occur. Successful results also verify that the FIB milling gratings are suitable for micro-moiré measurement and can generate high quality moiré fringes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

37349065454	Full-field strain measurement based on least-square fitting of local displacement for digital image correlation method	In order to obtain reliable strain field, full-field strain measurement based on least-square fitting of local displacement for digital image correlation method is proposed. The principle of digital image correlation (DIC) method is introduced, and full-field strain measurement based on local least-square fitting is expatiated, strain calculation near the border, hole and crack are also discussed. The results from homogeneous deformation test and the tensile test of the aluminum specimen with a hole in the center obviously demonstrated the validity of this technique. Large strain calculating window is recommended to use in case of homogeneous deformation, so calculation results approach true value; For inhomogeneous deformation, large calculating window should be selected to according to the noise level of the local displacement field, but when displacement field has high accuracy, smaller calculating window is selected.

84896977141	An efficient and accurate 3D displacements tracking strategy for digital volume correlation	Owing to its inherent computational complexity, practical implementation of digital volume correlation (DVC) for internal displacement and strain mapping faces important challenges in improving its computational efficiency. In this work, an efficient and accurate 3D displacement tracking strategy is proposed for fast DVC calculation. The efficiency advantage is achieved by using three improvements. First, to eliminate the need of updating Hessian matrix in each iteration, an efficient 3D inverse compositional Gauss-Newton (3D IC-GN) algorithm is introduced to replace existing forward additive algorithms for accurate sub-voxel displacement registration. Second, to ensure the 3D IC-GN algorithm that converges accurately and rapidly and avoid time-consuming integer-voxel displacement searching, a generalized reliability-guided displacement tracking strategy is designed to transfer accurate and complete initial guess of deformation for each calculation point from its computed neighbors. Third, to avoid the repeated computation of sub-voxel intensity interpolation coefficients, an interpolation coefficient lookup table is established for tricubic interpolation. The computational complexity of the proposed fast DVC and the existing typical DVC algorithms are first analyzed quantitatively according to necessary arithmetic operations. Then, numerical tests are performed to verify the performance of the fast DVC algorithm in terms of measurement accuracy and computational efficiency. The experimental results indicate that, compared with the existing DVC algorithm, the presented fast DVC algorithm produces similar precision and slightly higher accuracy at a substantially reduced computational cost. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84908627742	Strain measurement of objects subjected to aerodynamic heating using digital image correlation: Experimental design and preliminary results	In thermomechanical testing of hypersonic materials and structures, direct observation and quantitative strain measurement of the front surface of a test specimen directly exposed to severe aerodynamic heating has been considered as a very challenging task. In this work, a novel quartz infrared heating device with an observation window is designed to reproduce the transient thermal environment experienced by hypersonic vehicles. The specially designed experimental system allows the capture of test article's surface images at various temperatures using an optical system outfitted with a bandpass filter. The captured images are post-processed by digital image correlation to extract full-field thermal deformation. To verify the viability and accuracy of the established system, thermal strains of a chromiumnickel austenite stainless steel sample heated from room temperature up to 600°C were determined. The preliminary results indicate that the air disturbance between the camera and the specimen due to heat haze induces apparent distortions in the recorded images and large errors in the measured strains, but the average values of the measured strains are accurate enough. Limitations and further improvements of the proposed technique are discussed.

43849085476	Study on subset size selection in digital image correlation for speckle patterns	Digital Image Correlation (DIC) has been established as a flexible and effective technique to measure the displacements on specimen surface by matching the reference subsets in the undeformed image with the target subsets in the deformed image. With the existing DIC techniques, the user must rely on experience and intuition to manually define the size of the reference subset, which is found to be critical to the accuracy of measured displacements. In this paper, the problem of subset size selection in the DIC technique is investigated. Based on the Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) correlation criterion as well as the assumption that the gray intensity gradients of image noise are much lower than that of speckle image, a theoretical model of the displacement measurement accuracy of DIC is derived. The theoretical model indicates that the displacement measurement accuracy of DIC can be accurately predicted based on the variance of image noise and Sum of Square of Subset Intensity Gradients (SSSIG). The model further leads to a simple criterion for choosing a proper subset size for the DIC analysis. Numerical experiments have been performed to validate the proposed concepts, and the calculated results show good agreements with the theoretical predictions. © 2008 Optical Society of America.

55349098478	A new mark shearing technique for strain measurement using digital image correlation method	The digital image correlation (DIC) method is a noncontact, full-field surface deformation measuring method, which is widely used in experimental mechanics. Although the DIC method has a high precision in displacement measurement, its precision in strain determination is a bit low. In this paper, a new mark shearing technique is proposed to improve the accuracy of the strain measurement of the DIC method. A wedge mirror is used to introduce a shearing distance of the marks, which are made on the specimen to calculate the strain. The measurement principle of the mark shearing technique is described in detail. From the analysis, it can be concluded that this method is suitable for both large-scaled and small-scaled specimens, and thus has a wider adaptability than the common DIC method. Using this method, the maximum gauge length is 80 mm, and the accuracy of strain measurement can reach 4 μm strains.

The improved technique employs a simple yet effective calibration technique to determine the linear relationship between the out-of-plane height and the measured in-plane displacements. In addition, the iterative spatial domain cross-correlation algorithm, i.e., the improved Newton-Raphson algorithm using the zero-normalized sum of squared differences correlation criterion and the second-order shape function was employed in image correlation analysis for in-plane displacement determination of the projected speckle patterns, which provides more reliable and accurate matching with a higher correlation coefficient.

61649120151	Large-deformation measurement based on reliable initial guess in digital image correlation method	In order to measure large deformation using digital image correlation method, a new initial guess technique is presented. The proposed technique obtains the reliable initial deformation guess of the first calculation point by manually selecting three or more points with distinct characteristics surrounding the reference subset center in the reference image and their corresponding locations in the deformed image. Then, reliable initial deformation guess can be determined according to the coordinate correspondence and is used as the iteration initial value of Newton-Rapshon method to further improve measurement accuracy. The proposed technique overcomes the shortcoming of the commonly used digital image correlation method which cannot work under the condition that the tested object has a rotation angle larger than seven degrees or large deformation. The measured displacement fields from image pairs with relative large rigid body rotation and large deformation compression test of polypropylene foam obviously demonstrate the validity of this technique.

A more general and practical intensity change model is employed with consideration of the linear intensity change of the deformed image, followed by an iterative least squares algorithm for calculating displacement field with sub-pixel accuracy. The concept of correlation function is not used in the ILS method, even though we prove that the algorithm is actually equivalent to the optimization of the sum of squared difference correlation function using improved Newton-Raphson method. Besides, different from the conventional strain estimation approaches based on smoothing the displacement fields first and followed by differentiation of the smoothed displacement fields, a simple yet effective PLS algorithm is proposed for extracting strain fields from the computed displacement fields. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed techniques is verified through numerical simulation experiments.

70450200804	Generalized spatial-gradient-based digital image correlation for displacement and shape measurement with subpixel accuracy	A generalized spatial-gradient-based digital image correlation (DIC) method is proposed for subpixel-accuracy displacement and shape measurement. The proposed method overcomes the limitations in existing spatial-gradient-based DIC methods by adopting a generalized linear intensity-change model, which can cope well with linear variation in lighting illumination and greyscale intensity change of an object's surface during the measurement. In addition, various displacement mapping functions can be easily incorporated into the proposed intensity-change model to approximate the underlying deformation of the subset, and a simple iterative least-squares algorithm is employed to detect the desired displacement parameters with a robust noise-proof performance. To evaluate the performance of the proposed technique, both computer simulation and an actual experiment have been carried out. The results clearly demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately measure the shape and displacement field, even when substantial intensity variations exist in the experimental images.

75149142144	Mean intensity gradient: An effective global parameter for quality assessment of the speckle patterns used in digital image correlation	Digital image correlation (DIC) is an image-based optical metrology for full-field deformation measurement. In DIC technique, the test object surface must be covered with a random speckle pattern, which deforms together with the object surface as a carrier of deformation information. In practice, the speckle patterns may show distinctly different intensity distribution characteristics and have an important influence on DIC measurements. How to assess the overall quality of different speckle patterns with a simple yet effective parameter is an interesting but confusing problem, and is also helpful to the optimal use of the technique. In this paper, a novel, simple, easy-to-calculate yet effective global parameter, called mean intensity gradient, is proposed for quality assessment of the speckle patterns used in DIC. To verify the correctness and effectiveness of the new concept, five different speckle patterns are numerically translated, and the displacements measured with DIC are compared with the exact ones. The errors are evaluated in terms of mean bias error and standard deviation error. It is shown that both mean bias error and standard deviation of the measured displacement are closely related to the mean intensity gradient of the speckle pattern used, and a so-called good speckle pattern should be of large mean intensity gradient. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

75249085634	Genuine full-field deformation measurement of an object with complex shape using reliability-guided digital image correlation	Digital image correlation (DIC) is an easy-to-implement yet powerful optical metrology for deformation measurement. The technique measures the displacement of a point of interest by matching the subsets surrounding the same point located in the reference image and the deformed image. Although the technique is simple in principle, the existing DIC technique has several deficiencies. For example, for the points located near or at the boundaries of a specified region of interest (ROI), the selected square subsets surrounding these points may contain unwanted or foreign pixels from background image or other regions. In the existing DIC method, these points are either intentionally excluded from calculation or automatically removed after calculation, and leads to the absence of deformation information for the boundary points. Besides, existing DIC technique is prone to yield erroneous measurement for specimen with geometric discontinuities. In this paper, two approaches are developed to overcome the deficiencies of existing DIC technique. First, a modified Zero-mean Normalized Sum of Squared Differences (ZNSSD) criterion is defined for the correlation analysis of subsets surrounding the boundary points. Second, considering the possible complex shape of the ROI, a scanning strategy guided by the correlation coefficients of computed points is proposed to ensure reliable computation between consecutive points. With these two measures, the deformation of all the points including those located near or at the ROI boundaries can be automatically, reliably, and accurately determined. The improved DIC technique is universally applicable to the genuine full-field deformation measurement of objects with complex or arbitrary shapes. Two typical experimental image pairs are processed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and the results successfully demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality. © 2009 Optical Society of America.

75449104624	Frequency-guided windowed fourier ridges technique for automatic demodulation of a single closed fringe pattern	A frequency-guided windowed Fourier ridgesFG-WFR) technique for phase extraction from a single closed fringe pattern is proposed. The algorithm begins with a selected seed point and is then guided by the local frequency of the computed pixels. For the seed point the whole spectral range is examined withWFR to provide reliable local frequency and phase estimation. However for the rest of the pixels the WFR algorithm is performed in a more narrow spectral range centered at the determined frequency of its computed neighboring pixel which not only enforces the continuity of the local frequency between adjacent pixels but also reduces computation consumption significantly. Besides since phase unwrapping can be readily implemented after demodulation of each pixel the algorithm directly offers a continuous phase map. The proposed FG-WFR algorithm is verified by successfully demodulating two computer simulated fringe patterns and one noisy experimental fringe pattern. © 2009 Optical Society of America.

77049119715	On errors of digital image correlation due to speckle patterns	Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is an effective and flexible optical tool for full-field deformation measurement. Some aspects that influence the accuracy and precision of DIC have not been thoroughly investigated. A typical example is that the speckle patterns on the specimen surface as a carrier of deformation information significantly affect the measurement of DIC. The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of speckle patterns on the displacement measurement error of the DIC. A concise theoretical model is derived, which indicates that the speckle pattern does not introduce systematic error but introduce random error in the measured displacement. Numerical experiments using five speckle patterns with distinctly different intensity distribution taken from actual experiments have been performed to validate the proposed concepts, and the results show that the standard deviation error (i.e. precision) of measured displacement are closely related to the speckle patterns and is in good agreement with the prediction of the proposed theoretical model. © 2009 SPIE.

77954913798	Generic gamma correction for accuracy enhancement in fringe-projection profilometry	Fringe-projection profilometry is one of the most commonly used noncontact methods for acquiring the threedimensional (3D) shape information of objects. In practice, the luminance nonlinearity caused by the gamma effect of a digital projector and a digital camera yields undesired fringe intensity changes, which substantially reduce the measurement accuracy. In this Letter, we present a robust and simple scheme to eliminate the intensity nonlinearity induced by the gamma effect by combining a universal phase-shifting algorithm with a gamma correction method. First, by using three-step and large-step phase-shifting techniques, the gamma value involved in the measurement system can be detected. Then, a gamma pre-encoding process is applied to the system for actual 3D shape measurements. With the proposed technique, high accuracy of measurement can be achieved with the conventional smallstep phase-shifting algorithm. The validity of the technique is verified by experiments. © 2010 Optical Society of America.

77957551182	Equivalence of digital image correlation criteria for pattern matching	In digital image correlation (DIC), to obtain the displacements of each point of interest, a correlation criterion must be predefined to evaluate the similarity between the reference subset and the target subset. The correlation criterion is of fundamental importance in DIC, and various correlation criteria have been designed and used in literature. However, little research has been carried out to investigate their relations. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive overview of various correlation criteria used in DIC. Then we focus on three robust and most widely used correlation criteria, i.e., a zero-mean normalized cross-correlation (ZNCC) criterion, a zero-mean normalized sum of squared difference (ZNSSD) criterion, and a parametric sum of squared difference (PSSD<inf>ab</inf>) criterion with two additional unknown parameters, since they are insensitive to the scale and offset changes of the target subset intensity and have been highly recommended for practical use in literature. The three correlation criteria are analyzed to establish their transversal relationships, and the theoretical analyses clearly indicate that the three correlation criteria are actually equivalent, which elegantly unifies these correlation criteria for pattern matching. Finally, the equivalence of these correlation criteria is further validated by numerical simulation and actual experiment. © 2010 Optical Society of America.

Second, we provide an overview of various correlation criteria used in DIC for evaluating the similarity of the reference and deformed subsets, and demonstrate the equivalence of three robust and mostly widely used correlation criteria, i.e., a zero-mean normalized cross-correlation (ZNCC) criterion, a zero-mean normalized sum of squared difference (ZNSSD) criterion and a parametric zero-mean normalized sum of squared difference (PZNSSD) criterion with two additional unknown parameters, which elegantly unifies these correlation criteria for pattern matching. Finally, to overcome the limitation of the existing DIC techniques, we introduce a robust and generally applicable reliability-guided DIC technique, in which the calculation path is guided by the ZNCC coefficients of computed points, to determine the genuine full-field deformation or shape of objects containing geometrical discontinuities and discontinuous deformation. © 2010 Society for Experimental Mechanics Inc.

79251538053	High-temperature digital image correlation method for full-field deformation measurement at 1200 °C	A simple, easy-to-implement yet effective high-temperature digital image correlation (DIC) method is established for non-contact full-field deformation measurement at elevated temperatures. The technique employs a bandpass optical filter to eliminate the influence of black-body radiation of high-temperature objects on the intensity of captured images. With the bandpass filter, high-quality digital images of an object at high temperatures up to 1200 °C can be easily acquired and directly compared with the reference image recorded at room temperature using the DIC technique to extract full-field deformation information with high fidelity.

79957737128	A fast digital image correlation method for deformation measurement	Fast and high-accuracy deformation analysis using digital image correlation (DIC) has been increasingly important and highly demanded in recent years. In literature, the DIC method using the NewtonRapshon (NR) algorithm has been considered as a gold standard for accurate sub-pixel displacement tracking, as it is insensitive to the relative deformation and rotation of the target subset and thus provides highest sub-pixel registration accuracy and widest applicability. A significant drawback of conventional NR-algorithm-based DIC method, however, is its extremely huge computational expense. In this paper, a fast DIC method is proposed deformation measurement by effectively eliminating the repeating redundant calculations involved in the conventional NR-algorithm-based DIC method. Specifically, a reliability-guided displacement scanning strategy is employed to avoid time-consuming integerpixel displacement searching for each calculation point, and a pre-computed global interpolation coefficient look-up table is utilized to entirely eliminate repetitive interpolation calculation at sub-pixel locations. With these two approaches, the proposed fast DIC method substantially increases the calculation efficiency of the traditional NR-algorithm-based DIC method. The performance of proposed fast DIC method is carefully tested on real experimental images using various calculation parameters. Results reveal that the computational speed of the present fast DIC is about 120200 times faster than that of the traditional method, without any loss of its measurement accuracy © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As it can be utilized as structural material of various heating components such as rocket liquid storage tank and missile wing, super-hard aluminum alloy 7A04 has been widely used in the field of aerospace engineering. However, the ultimate strength and other token mechanical parameters of aluminum alloy 7A04 at transient high-temperature heating environment are still unclear to us, as these key mechanical parameters are lacking in existing strength design handbook. Experimental characterization of these critical parameters of aluminum alloy 7A04 is undoubtedly meaningful to the reliability estimation, life prediction and security design of the high-speed flight vehicle. In this paper, by combining transient aerodynamic heating simulation system and material testing machine, the high-temperature ultimate strength, loading time and other mechanical properties of super-hard aluminum alloy 7A04 under different transient heating temperature and loading conditions were investigated Experimental results revealed that the ultimate strength and loading capability of aluminum alloy 7A04 subjected to transient thermal heating were much higher than those tested in a long-time stable high-temperature environment.

80155161436	Nonlinear behavior of bumper foams under uniaxial compressive cyclic loading	Theoretical and experimental studies on the nonlinear behaviors of bumper foams under cyclic loading are carried out in this paper. To study the compressible materials, the incompressible viscoelastic model proposed by Rajagopal and Srinivasa in 2000 is modified and expressed as a function of the principal stretches. The modified model is used to describe bumper foams for the first time. Besides, in order to better predict the nonlinear process of bumper foams under cyclic loading, a new compressible viscoplastic model is proposed, which is expressed separately as the invariants of stretches and the principal stretches. Then the compressible viscoelastic model and the compressible viscoplastic model are used to describe the response of bumper foams under cyclic loading with constant and variable amplitudes, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the compressible viscoelastic model and the compressible viscoplastic model are both suitable to describe the response of bumper foams under cyclic loading, the new proposed compressible viscoplastic model is more suitable to describe the deformation at the end of each cycle. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The research of active control on flexible structural vibration is very important in spacecraft design. Active vibration control on a flexible beam with piezoelectric pieces bonded in surface is investigated experimentally using independent modal space control method, which is able to control the first three modes independently. A comparison between the system responses before and after control indicates that the modal damping of flexible structure is greatly improved after active control is performed, indicating remarkable vibration suppression effect. Dynamic equation of the flexible beam is deducted by Hamilton principle, and numerical simulation of active vibration control on the first three order vibration modes is also conducted in this paper.

Using the self-developed transient aerodynamic heating simulation system designed for high-speed aircrafts, the heat-shielding performance of MTPS in the non-linear high temperature environment up to 800°C was experimentally investigated. The heat-transfer characteristics of MTPS at transient and steady states, and the heat insulation effects at various temperatures, were obtained. Also, by carefully considering the multiple heat exchange including the radiation among the inside honeycomb walls, the heat transfer of the metal structure and the heat transfer of the air within the honeycomb cavity, a three dimensional finite element model was established to simulate the heat-shielding performance of the honeycomb panels. The numerical simulations agree well with the experimental results, verifying the correctness and effectiveness of the numerical simulation method. The good agreements also confirm the feasibility of substituting expensive air thermal simulation testing using numerical simulation. Some other key issues, such as heat shielding efficiency variation of the MTPS in complex non-linear high temperature environment, the relationship among the heat shielding efficiency, the change speed of front surface temperature and selection of emissivity for the MTPS' surface, were also discussed in this work, which provide important references for the heat-shielding of MTPS to be used in high-speed crafts.

84863347181	Internal displacement and strain measurement using digital volume correlation: A least-squares framework	As a novel tool for quantitative 3D internal deformation measurement throughout the interior of a material or tissue, digital volume correlation (DVC) has increasingly gained attention and application in the fields of experimental mechanics, material research and biomedical engineering. However, the practical implementation of DVC involves important challenges such as implementation complexity, calculation accuracy and computational efficiency. In this paper, a least-squares framework is presented for 3D internal displacement and strain field measurement using DVC. The proposed DVC combines a practical linear-intensity-change model with an easy-to-implement iterative least-squares (ILS) algorithm to retrieve 3D internal displacement vector field with sub-voxel accuracy. Because the linear-intensity-change model is capable of accounting for both the possible intensity changes and the relative geometric transform of the target subvolume, the presented DVC thus provides the highest sub-voxel registration accuracy and widest applicability. Furthermore, as the ILS algorithm uses only first-order spatial derivatives of the deformed volumetric image, the developed DVC thus significantly reduces computational complexity. To further extract 3D strain distributions from the 3D discrete displacement vectors obtained by the ILS algorithm, the presented DVC employs a pointwise least-squares algorithm to estimate the strain components for each measurement point. Computer-simulated volume images with controlled displacements are employed to investigate the performance of the proposed DVC method in terms of mean bias error and standard deviation error. Results reveal that the present technique is capable of providing accurate measurements in an easy-to-implement manner, and can be applied to practical 3D internal displacement and strain calculation. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84863770013	Optimization of a three-dimensional digital image correlation system for deformation measurements in extreme environments	An optimized 3D digital image correlation (3D-DIC) system using active optical imaging is developed for accurate shape and 3D deformation measurements in nonlaboratory conditions or extreme hightemperature environments. In contrast to a conventional 3D-DIC system using white or natural light illumination, the proposed active imaging 3D-DIC system is based on a combination of monochromatic lighting and bandpass filter imaging. Because the bandpass filter attached before the imaging lenses allows only the actively illuminated monochromatic light to pass through and blocks all light outside of its bandpass range, the active imaging 3D-DIC system is therefore insensitive to serious variations in ambient light in nonlaboratory environments and to the thermal radiation of hot objects in extreme high-temperature environments. Two challenging experiments that cannot be performed by a conventional 3D-DIC system were carried out to verify the robustness and accuracy of the developed active imaging 3D-DIC system. Because a much wider application range can be achieved with relatively simple and easy-to-implement improvements, the proposed active imaging 3D-DIC system is highly recommended for practical use instead of the conventional 3D-DIC system. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

During a high-speed flight, the surface temperatures of the wing, fairing and projectile rise rapidly because of aerodynamic heating, which is accompanied by serious structural vibration. The aerodynamic heating causes significant changes in the mechanical properties of the structure, and the high temperature gradients produced by the complex maneuver-flight generate thermal stress. They both affect seriously the characteristics of the structure's natural vibration. In this paper, a joint thermal-vibration testing is performed on the wing structure of a cruise missile, and the vibration characteristics of the wing structure (e.g., the natural frequency) at various temperatures are obtained. The experimental results can provide a reliable basis for the safety design of cruise missiles under high-speed, high-temperature and vibration conditions.

84868358418	Large deformation measurement using digital image correlation: A fully automated approach	In digital image correlation, the iterative spatial domain cross-correlation algorithm is considered as a gold standard for matching the corresponding points in two images, but requires an accurate initial guess of the deformation parameters to converge correctly and rapidly. In this work, we present a fully automated method to accurately initialize all points of interest for the deformed images in the presence of large rotation and/or heterogeneous deformation. First, a robust computer vision technique is adopted to match feature points detected in reference and deformed images. The deformation parameters of the seed point are initialized from the affine transform, which is fitted to the matched feature points around it. Subsequently, the refined parameters are automatically transferred to adjacent points using a modified quality-guided initial guess propagation scheme. The proposed method not only ensures a rapid and correct convergence of the nonlinear optimization algorithm by providing a complete and accurate initial guess of deformation for each measurement point, but also effectively deals with deformed images with relatively large rotation and/or heterogeneous deformation. Tests on both simulated speckle images and real-world foam compression experiment verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

84871416451	Systematic errors in two-dimensional digital image correlation due to lens distortion	Lens distortion practically presents in a real optical imaging system causing non-uniform geometric distortion in the recorded images, and gives rise to additional errors in the displacement and strain results measured by two-dimensional digital image correlation (2D-DIC). In this work, the systematic errors in the displacement and strain results measured by 2D-DIC due to lens distortion are investigated theoretically using the radial lens distortion model and experimentally through easy-to-implement rigid body, in-plane translation tests. Theoretical analysis shows that the displacement and strain errors at an interrogated image point are not only in linear proportion to the distortion coefficient of the camera lens used, but also depend on its distance relative to distortion center and its magnitude of displacement. To eliminate the systematic errors caused by lens distortion, a simple linear least-squares algorithm is proposed to estimate the distortion coefficient from the distorted displacement results of rigid body, in-plane translation tests, which can be used to correct the distorted displacement fields to obtain unbiased displacement and strain fields. Experimental results verify the correctness of the theoretical derivation and the effectiveness of the proposed lens distortion correction method. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84877911642	High-accuracy two-dimensional digital image correlation measurement system using a bilateral telecentric lens	By comparing the two images recorded in different configurations on the same object surface, two-dimensional digital image correlation (2D-DIC) method produces full-field displacement with sub-pixel accuracy and full-field strains in the recorded images. In a practical measurement, however, various deteriorative factors, such as small out-of-plane motion of the test object surface, small out-of-plane motion of the sensor target and geometric distortion of the imaging lens may seriously impair the originally assumed linear correspondence between images displacement and object motions. In certain cases, these disadvantages may lead to significant errors in measuring displacements and strains. The measurement errors of 2D-DIC due to the above three unavoidable deteriorative factors are first described briefly. Then, the performances of three typical imaging lenses, including a standard lens, an object-side telecentric lens and a bilateral telecentric lens, against these three deteriorative factors are investigated experimentally using easy-to-implement static, out-of-plane and in-plane rigid body translation tests. A detailed examination reveals that a high-quality bilateral telecentric lens is not only insensitive to out-of-plane motions of the test object and the self-heating of a camera being used, but also demonstrates negligible lens distortion. So the bilateral lens is highly recommended for high accuracy 2D-DIC measurement.

84879882608	Bias error reduction of digital image correlation using Gaussian pre-filtering	In digital image correlation (DIC), the iterative spatial domain cross-correlation algorithm using high-order B-spline interpolation algorithms has been strongly recommended for accurate sub-pixel displacement measurement. However, the magnitude of the position-dependent bias error increases with the increase of noise level, which dramatically reduces the registration accuracy of DIC for real experimental images. In this paper, a simple method, based on pre-smoothing the speckle images with a 5×5 pixels Gaussian low-pass filter prior to correlation analysis, is proposed for reducing the bias error in measured displacements. Both numerical simulations and real experiments reveal that the proposed technique is capable of reducing the bias error in measured displacement to a negligible degree for both noisy and noiseless images, even though a simple bicubic interpolation is used. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The high temperatures caused by aerodynamic heating can greatly change the elasticity properties of the materials in a high-speed flight vehicle, leading to an alteration in the vibration characteristics of high-speed flight vehicle structures. Knowledge of the vibration characteristics of these key structures is critical to the safety design of high-speed flight vehicles. In this paper, vibration excitation was exerted to a hollow wing under controlled thermal environments by combining a self-developed transient aerodynamic heating device with a vibration test system. A self-designed extension configuration withstanding high temperature is used to transfer the vibration signals to the non-high temperature zone for vibration data acquisition. With this novel method, accurate measurements of various vibration characteristics parameters, such as natural frequency and vibration modal, can be achieved in a thermal-mechanical environment with a highest temperature up to 900_C. Experimental results provide an important basis for the dynamic characteristic analysis and safety design of the hollow wing structure used in a long-range high-speed flight vehicles under high-temperature thermal-vibration conditions.

Through the self-developed aerodynamic heating experiment simulation system, the heat transfer characteristics of a metallic honeycomb core panel were tested from 200 C to 900 C. The heat insulation effects at various temperatures were also obtained experimentally. A three-dimensional (3-D) finite element model was used to numerically compute the heat-transfer properties of the metallic honeycomb core panel, and all of the internal radiation of the honeycomb core panel, the heat conduction of the metal structure, and the heat transfer of the air within the honeycomb core cavities were considered in the numerical simulation. Overall, the experimental results agreed well with the numerical simulations. The equivalent thermal conductivity of the metallic honeycomb core panel varied from 0.447 W/(m C) to 1.52 W/(m C) when the front surface temperature increased from 200 C to 900 C.

84881334397	Automated and accurate initialization of digital image correlation for large deformation measurement	Digital image correlation matches the corresponding locations in the reference and deformed images by optimizing the correlation of the related intensities. Iterative algorithm is regarded as the most effective approach to solving the optimization, but it requires accurate initial guess of the deformation parameters to converge correctly and rapidly. This paper presents a fully automated method which provides accurate initialization for all points of interest in a deformed images and deals with large rotation and heterogeneous deformation. Image features are extracted and pre-matched in the reference and the deformed images. The deformation parameter of a sample point is initialized by the mapping function fitted to the matched features in the vicinity. Once the subsequent iterative optimization achieves a qualified correlation measure, the optimized parameter is used to initiate a parameter transfer. To account for potential deformation difference between successive points, propagation functions are used during the transfer, which are analytically derived to accurately relate the parameters of two points separated by a given distance. The parameter transfer is conducted by the quality of correlation optimization and continued till all the points have been analyzed. Results on both simulated deformations and real-world experiments demonstrate that image features can be reliably matched and automatically generate qualified seed points even in the presence of complex transformation. Parameter transfer using propagation function enables rapid and correct convergence of the nonlinear iterative optimization, allows more flexible choice on the interval between adjacent sample points, and meanwhile handles the heterogeneity of the deformation field. © 2013 SPIE.

In this paper, the application of DIC for real-time long-distance bridge deflection detection in outdoor environments is studied. Bridge deflection measurement using DIC in outdoor environments is more challenging than regular DIC measurements performed under laboratory conditions. First, much more image noise due to variations in ambient light will be presented in the images recorded in outdoor environments. Second, how to select the target area becomes a key factor because long-distance imaging results in a large field of view of the test object. Finally, the image acquisition speed of the camera must be high enough (larger than 100 fps) to capture the real-time dynamic motion of a bridge. In this work, the above challenging issues are addressed and several improvements were made to DIC method. The applicability was demonstrated by real experiments. Experimental results indicate that the DIC method has great potentials in motion measurement in various large building structures. © 2013 SPIE.

84881557778	Fast, Robust and Accurate Digital Image Correlation Calculation Without Redundant Computations	High-efficiency and high-accuracy deformation analysis using digital image correlation (DIC) has become increasingly important in recent years, considering the ongoing trend of using higher resolution digital cameras and common requirement of processing a large sequence of images recorded in a dynamic testing. In this work, to eliminate the redundant computations involved in conventional DIC method using forward additive matching strategy and classic Newton-Raphson (FA-NR) algorithm without sacrificing its sub-pixel registration accuracy, we proposed an equivalent but more efficient DIC method by combining inverse compositional matching strategy and Gauss-Newton (IC-GN) algorithm for fast, robust and accurate full-field displacement measurement. To this purpose, first, an efficient IC-GN algorithm, without the need of re-evaluating and inverting Hessian matrix in each iteration, is introduced to optimize the robust zero-mean normalized sum of squared difference (ZNSSD) criterion to determine the desired deformation parameters of each interrogated subset. Then, an improved reliability-guided displacement tracking strategy is employed to achieve further speed advantage by automatically providing accurate and complete initial guess of deformation for the IC-GN algorithm implemented on each calculation point. Finally, an easy-to-implement interpolation coefficient look-up table approach is employed to avoid the repeated calculation of bicubic interpolation at sub-pixel locations. With the above improvements, redundant calculations involved in various procedures (i.e. initial guess of deformation, sub-pixel displacement registration and sub-pixel intensity interpolation) of conventional DIC method are entirely eliminated. The registration accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed DIC method are carefully tested using numerical experiments and real experimental images. Experimental results verify that the proposed DIC method using IC-GN algorithm and the existing DIC method using classic FA-NR algorithm generate similar results, but the former is about three to five times faster. The proposed reliability-guided IC-GN algorithm is expected to be a new standard full-field displacement tracking algorithm in DIC. © 2013 Society for Experimental Mechanics.

84886286563	High-Accuracy 2D Digital Image Correlation Measurements with Bilateral Telecentric Lenses: Error Analysis and Experimental Verification	By comparing two digital images of a test planar specimen surface recorded in different configurations, two-dimensional digital image correlation (2D-DIC) provides full-field displacements to sub-pixel accuracy and full-field strains in the recorded images. For the 2D-DIC systems using an optical lens, a simple pinhole imaging model is commonly used to describe the linear relationship between the measured sensor plane displacements and the actual displacements in the object surface. However, in a practical measurement, various unavoidable disadvantageous factors, such as small out-of-plane motion of the test object surface occurred after loading, small out-of-plane motion of the sensor target due to the self-heating or temperature variation of a camera, and geometric distortion of the imaging lens, may seriously impair or slightly change the originally assumed linear correspondence. In certain cases, these disadvantages may lead to significant errors in displacements and strains measured by 2D-DIC. In this work, the measurement errors of 2D-DIC due to the above three disadvantageous factors are first described in detail. Then, to minimize the errors associated with these disadvantages, a high-accuracy 2D-DIC system using a bilateral telecentric lens is established. The performance of the established 2D-DIC system and other two 2D-DIC systems using a conventional lens and an object-side telecentric lens are investigated experimentally using easy-to-implement stationary, out-of-plane and in-plane rigid body translation tests. A detailed examination reveals that a high-quality bilateral telecentric lens is not only insensitive to out-of-plane motion of the test object and the self-heating of a camera, but also demonstrates negligible lens distortion. Uniaxial tensile tests of an aluminum specimen were also performed to quantitatively compare the axial and transversal strains measured by the proposed 2D-DIC system and those measured by strain gage rosettes.

84892698550	High-accuracy 2D digital image correlation measurements using low-cost imaging lenses: Implementation of a generalized compensation method	The ideal pinhole imaging model commonly assumed for an ordinary two-dimensional digital image correlation (2D-DIC) system is neither perfect nor stable because of the existence of small out-of-plane motion of the test sample surface that occurred after loading, small out-of-plane motion of the sensor target due to temperature variation of a camera and unavoidable geometric distortion of an imaging lens. In certain cases, these disadvantages can lead to significant errors in the measured displacements and strains. Although a high-quality bilateral telecentric lens has been strongly recommended to be used in the 2D-DIC system as an essential optical component to achieve high-accuracy measurement, it is not generally applicable due to its fixed field of view, limited depth of focus and high cost. To minimize the errors associated with the imperfectness and instability of a common 2D-DIC system using a low-cost imaging lens, a generalized compensation method using a non-deformable reference sample is proposed in this work. With the proposed method, the displacement of the reference sample rigidly attached behind the test sample is first measured using 2D-DIC, and then it is fitted using a parametric model. The fitted parametric model is then used to correct the displacements of the deformed sample to remove the influences of these unfavorable factors. The validity of the proposed compensation method is first verified using out-of-plane translation, out-of-plane rotation, in-plane translation tests and their combinations. Uniaxial tensile tests of an aluminum specimen were also performed to quantitatively examine the strain accuracy of the proposed compensation method. Experiments show that the proposed compensation method is an easy-to-implement yet effective technique for achieving high-accuracy deformation measurement using an ordinary 2D-DIC system. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84894534060	Research on thermal protection performances of metallic honeycomb panel subjected to high-speed thermal shock	In this paper, by using a self-developed transient aerodynamic thermal simulation system, the thermal protection performances of metallic honeycomb panel were tested at different transient heating rates, with a maximum instantaneous temperature reaching 950°C. Furthermore, a three-dimensional finite element model was established to determine the thermal protection performances of the metallic honeycomb panel in different simulation environments with high heating rates. The fact that the numerical calculations agreed well with the experimental results is a good foundation for replacing certain expensive thermal experiments with numerical calculations. The results of this research provided important reference values for the design of the thermal protection system comprising metallic honeycomb panel structures. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84899071083	High-temperature strain measurement using active imaging digital image correlation and infrared radiation heating	A technique for non-contact and full-field high-temperature strain measurement of a sample subjected to radiation heating using active imaging digital image correlation is described in this work. A high-performance quartz lamp heater system was designed to reproduce transient thermal environments experienced by hypersonic vehicles. The digital images of the test sample surface at various temperatures are captured using a novel active imaging optical system based on a combination of monochromatic light illumination and bandpass filter imaging. Subsequently, the captured images are processed by a robust reliability-guided displacement tracking algorithm with an automatic reference image updating scheme to extract full-field thermal deformation. With the improvements made in both the imaging system and correlation algorithm, the de-correlation problem of speckle patterns caused by the thermal radiation and surface oxidation of the heated test object are effectively addressed, enabling reliable deformation measurement in extremely high temperature environments. The performance of the proposed active imaging digital image correlation technique is verified by two experiments: (1) measurement of the uniform thermal strains of a chromium-nickel austenite stainless steel sample which is heated from room temperature to 1300 °C, and (2) measurement of the non-uniform thermal strain fields of a woven C/SiC composite at 1550 °C. The test results show that the active imaging digital image correlation is an easy-to-implement yet effective optical technique for high-temperature strain measurement, and has great potential in characterizing thermo-mechanical behaviour of materials and structures for hypersonic vehicles. Limitations and potential improvements of the present technique are also discussed. © 2013 IMechE.

84901353370	Experimental study and numerical simulation of active vibration control of a highly flexible beam using piezoelectric intelligent material	Active vibration control of a flexible beam with piezoelectric pieces on the surface is investigated experimentally using the independent modal space control method, which is able to control the first three modes of the beam independently. A comparison between the responses of the beam before and after control indicates that the modal damping of the flexible beam is greatly improved and the effects of vibration suppression are very remarkable. The dynamic equation of the beam is deduced by Hamilton's principles, and numerical simulation of the active vibration control of the first three modes of the beam is also conducted in this paper. The simulation results match the experimental results very well. Both the experimental and numerical results indicate that by using piezo-patches as actuators the independent mode control method is a very effective approach to realize vibration suppression, and has promising applications in the aerospace field. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

84901721510	In-plane displacement and strain measurements using a camera phone and digital image correlation	In-plane displacement and strain measurements of planar objects by processing the digital images captured by a camera phone using digital image correlation (DIC) are performed in this paper. As a convenient communication tool for everyday use, the principal advantages of a camera phone are its low cost, easy accessibility, and compactness. However, when used as a two-dimensional DIC system for mechanical metrology, the assumed imaging model of a camera phone may be slightly altered during the measurement process due to camera misalignment, imperfect loading, sample deformation, and temperature variations of the camera phone, which can produce appreciable errors in the measured displacements. In order to obtain accurate DIC measurements using a camera phone, the virtual displacements caused by these issues are first identified using an unstrained compensating specimen and then corrected by means of a parametric model. The proposed technique is first verified using in-plane translation and out-of-plane translation tests. Then, it is validated through a determination of the tensile strains and elastic properties of an aluminum specimen. Results of the present study show that accurate DIC measurements can be conducted using a common camera phone provided that an adequate correction is employed. © 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

84902661921	High-accuracy 2D digital image correlation measurements with bilateral telecentric lenses: Error analysis and experimental verification	By comparing two digital images of a test planar specimen surface recorded in different configurations, two-dimensional digital image correlation (2D-DIC) provides full-field displacements to sub-pixel accuracy and full-field strains in the recorded images. For the 2D-DIC systems using an optical lens, a simple pinhole imaging model is commonly used to describe the linear relationship between the measured sensor plane displacements and the actual displacements in the object surface. However, in a practical measurement, various unavoidable disadvantageous factors, such as small out-of-plane motion of the test object surface occurred after loading, small out-of-plane motion of the sensor target due to the self-heating or temperature variation of a camera, and geometric distortion of the imaging lens, may seriously impair or slightly change the originally assumed linear correspondence. In certain cases, these disadvantages may lead to significant errors in displacements and strains measured by 2D-DIC. In this work, the measurement errors of 2D-DIC due to the above three disadvantageous factors are first described in detail. Then, to minimize the errors associated with these disadvantages, a high-accuracy 2D-DIC system using a bilateral telecentric lens is established. The performance of the established 2D-DIC system and other two 2D-DIC systems using a conventional lens and an object-side telecentric lens are investigated experimentally using easy-to-implement stationary, out-of-plane and in-plane rigid body translation tests. A detailed examination reveals that a high-quality bilateral telecentric lens is not only insensitive to out-of-plane motion of the test object and the self-heating of a camera, but also demonstrates negligible lens distortion. Uniaxial tensile tests of an aluminum specimen were also performed to quantitatively compare the axial and transversal strains measured by the proposed 2D-DIC system and those measured by strain gage rosettes. The perfect agreement between the two measurements further verifies the accuracy of the established 2D-DIC system. © Society for Experimental Mechanics 2013.

84902808442	Experimental study on the thermal-vibration testing of the wing structure of high-speed vehicles	During long time and high speed flight, high-speed aircraft structures, such as the wings and rudders, bear not only prolonged serious vibration, but also harsh aerodynamic heating. The high temperatures caused by aerodynamic heating can significantly change the mechanical properties of the materials and structures, including the elastic modulus, stiffness, and so on. Meanwhile, the complex flight maneuver process will also produce high-temperature gradients, which affect the thermal stress field of the structures. Both of these impacts significantly affect the natural vibration characteristics of the high-speed aircraft. In this paper, the wing structure vibration characteristics were investigated in high temperature environments. A self-designed extension configuration withstanding high temperature was used to transfer the vibration signals to the non-high temperature zone for vibration data acquisition by using the regular acceleration sensors. Combined this novel method and the self-developed thermal-vibration test system, the thermalvibration joint testing was performed on the wing structure of high-speed flight vehicles under a thermal environment with the highest temperature up to 600 °C and the vibration characteristics of the wing structure (e.g., the natural frequency) at various temperatures were obtained. The experimental results can provide a reliable basis for the safety design of the wing structure of high speed vehicles under high-speed thermal vibration conditions. © 2014 SPIE.

84903821434	Experimental investigation and numerical modeling for elasto-plastic notch-root stress/strain analysis under monotonic loadings	Experimental investigation and numerical modeling on elasto-plastic notch-root stress/strain distributions under monotonic loadings of both the Ni-based directionally solidified (DS) superalloy and Titanium alloy were carried out simultaneously. For measuring inhomogeneous deformation fields at notch roots, an optical-numerical full-field surface deformation measurement system was developed based on the digital image correlation (DIC) method. The obtained strain distributions were then verified with reasonable accuracy by finite element simulation, where an anisotropic elastic-viscoplastic constitutive model was developed for DS superalloy and a simple isotropic stress-strain relationship was adopted for Titanium alloy. Meanwhile, factors affecting elasto-plastic notch-root stress/strain distributions were systematically investigated numerically, where the emphasis was placed on temperature, loading stress rate, sample shape, anisotropy and notch features. The results show that stress/strain behavior at notch root is significantly affected by the mentioned factors, which are concretely embodied in the distribution of tensile stress/strain, equivalent stress and accumulative equivalent plastic strain. © 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84903892519	Thermal protection performances of metallic honeycomb panel structure at transient thermal shock environment	By using a self-developed transient aerodynamic thermal simulation system of high-speed aircraft, the heat-shielding performance of metallic honeycomb panel structure was tested at different transient thermal shock rates ranging from 5°C/s to 30°C/s, with the maximum instantaneous temperature reaching 950°C. Furthermore, a three-dimensional finite element method was established to determine the heat-shielding performance of the metallic honeycomb panel structure at different simulation environments with high thermal shock rates. The numerical calculation results coincide with the corresponding experimental results, verifying the credibility and effectiveness of the experimental methods and the numerical calculation approach. The tested metallic honeycomb panel structure exhibited slight planar flexure and deformation after the experiment in the high-temperature (950°C) environment; thus, in the context of high-speed flight vehicles, this structure is particularly suitable for structural components that must be made of lightweight materials with slight deformation in a high-temperature environment.

84906875234	Three-dimensional displacement measurement based on the combination of digital holography and digital image correlation	A new simultaneous three-dimensional (3D) displacement measurement technique based on the combination of digital holography (DH) and digital imaging correlation (DIC) is proposed. The current DH-based 3D displacement measurement technique needs three sets of DH setups, and only the phase images are utilized in measurements, with all the intensity images discarded. In contrast, the proposed new technique only adopts a single off-axis DH setup. In the proposed technique, the phase images are used to extract out-of-plane displacements, but the intensity images (instead of being discarded) are processed by an intensity correlation algorithmto retrieve in-plane displacement components. Because the proposed technique fully takes advantage of all the information obtained by an offaxis DH without additional optical arrangements, it is simpler and more practical than the existing DH-based 3D displacement measurement technique. Experiments performed on a United States Air Force (USAF) target demonstrate that both the in-plane and out-of-plane displacements can be accurately determined by the proposed technique. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84908371145	An evaluation of convergence criteria for digital image correlation using inverse compositional Gauss-Newton algorithm	A fast, robust and accurate digital image correlation (DIC) method, which uses a robust zero-mean normalized sum of squared difference correlation criterion, a sophisticated reliability-guided displacement tracking strategy and an efficient inverse compositional Gauss-Newton (IC-GN) algorithm, was recently proposed for full-field deformation measurement. As an iterative local optimization algorithm, IC-GN algorithm iteratively solves for the incremental warp assumed on the reference subset until the preset convergence criteria are satisfied. In the literature, different convergence criteria have been set for iterative optimization algorithms. However, on the one hand, stringent convergence criteria lead to increased number of iterations and lessen the computational efficiency. On the other hand, too loose convergence conditions enhance the computational efficiency but may decrease the registration accuracy. Understanding the impact of prescribed convergence criteria on DIC measurement and how to choose proper convergence criteria are therefore fundamental problems in realizing high-efficiency yet high-accuracy DIC analysis. In this paper, the convergence characteristics of IC-GN algorithm are investigated in terms of convergence speed and radius of convergence using real experimental images. The effect of various convergence criteria on the efficiency and accuracy of IC-GN algorithm are carefully examined. Recommendations are given to select proper convergence criteria for more efficient implement of IC-GN algorithm.

84908384840	Strain field denoising for digital image correlation using a regularized cost-function	In digital image correlation (DIC), the widely used forward-additive Newton-Raphson (FA-NR) algorithm and the recently introduced equivalent but more efficient inverse-compositional Gauss-Newton (IC-GN) algorithm are capable of providing both displacements and displacement gradients (strains) for each calculation point. However, the obtained displacement gradients are seriously corrupted by various noises, and for this reason these directly computed strains are usually considered as useless information and therefore discarded. To extract strain distributions more accurately, much research efforts have been dedicated to how to smooth and differentiate the noisy displacement fields using appropriate numerical approaches. In this contribution, contrary to these existing strain estimation approaches, a novel and alternative strain estimation approach, based on denoising the noisy strain fields obtained by FA-NR or IC-GN algorithm using a regularized cost-function, is proposed. The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed strain estimation technique is carefully examined using both computer-simulated images with imposed homogeneous and inhomogeneous deformation, and experimentally obtained images. Experimental results reveal that the strains obtained by the proposed method are comparable to those determined by post-processing of the displacement fields using conventional pointwise least squares strain estimation approach.

84910143973	Experimental and Numerical Study on Heat Transfer Characteristics of Metallic Honeycomb Core Structure in Transient Thermal Shock Environments	The metallic honeycomb core structure has important engineering applications in the aerospace and aviation fields due to several advantages, such as being lightweight, its strong resistance to deformation in high-temperature environments, and its excellent energy absorption characteristics. In the present study, a transient heating experimental system for high-speed flight vehicles was developed to study the thermal insulation characteristics of a superalloy honeycomb core structure at different thermal shock rates (5◦C.s-1 to 30 ◦C.s-1). The highest instantaneous temperature tested was 950◦C. The three-dimensional finite element method was used to numerically calculate the thermal insulation characteristics of the metallic honeycomb core structure in a high-speed thermal shock environment. The calculated results agree well with the experimental results; this agreement demonstrates that to an extent, numerical calculations are a better alternative than expensive experiments. The results of this study provide an important reference for the thermal protection design of metallic honeycomb core structures of high-speed flight vehicles.
