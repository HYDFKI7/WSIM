17744374958	Gallbladder carcinoma with biliary invasion: Clinical analysis of the differences from nonbiliary invasion	Gallbladder carcinoma is the most common malignancy of the biliary tract. Because of a lack of specific presentations, this condition frequently is diagnosed only at an advanced stage. The clinical difference between gallbladder carcinoma with and without biliary involvement remains uncertain. This study recruited all patients with gallbladder carcinoma treated at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Taoyuan, Taiwan) from 1987 to 2002. The sample included 120 patients aged 28 to 91 years (mean 65.5 ± 12.3 years) (39 men, 81 women), whose medical records were reviewed retrospectively. Based on the 2002 newly revised TNM classification, 25, 38, 28, and 29 patients had stage I, II, III, and IV disease, respectively. After we excluded patients with stage I, the other patients were classified into two groups as follows: group I, gallbladder carcinoma with biliary invasion (n = 41); group II, carcinoma without biliary involvement (n = 54). The clinical presentations, laboratory data, operative methods, and outcome of these two groups were compared. The two groups did not differ in terms of age, sex distribution, cholelithiasis, and most clinical presentations. Chemistry laboratory data also identified patients in group I with significantly elevated liver function tests. Group II had a borderline tendency toward better curative resectability than group I (p = 0.09). Survival was significantly better for group I patients who underwent curative resection (n = 5) via cholecystectomy, partial hepatectomy, and bile duct resection than for those with noncurative resection (p < 0.05). However, long-term survival demonstrated that gallbladder carcinoma had the same poor prognosis in the two groups. In conclusion, gallbladder carcinoma with biliary invasion has been found to a more overt clinical presentation and abnormal laboratory data, which might alert clinicians to consider gallbladder carcinoma at an advanced stage or biliary invasion and examine the underlying disease. Generally, the outcome of gallbladder carcinoma is dismal, and radical curative resection the combined with cholecystectomy, partial hepatectomy, and bile duct resection perhaps may offer good benefits for advanced gallbladder carcinoma. Furthermore, surgical resection should be performed whenever possible in patients with gallbladder carcinoma to increase life expectancy. © 2004 by the Société Internationale de Chirurgie.

18144439461	Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in Taiwan	We report our experience of the surgical treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in Taiwanese patients. A total of 162 patients with histologically proven ICC were treated of whom 106 (65.4%) had associated hepatolithiasis. Patients with hepatolithiasis were in earlier stages than those without hepatolithiasis. Two-thirds of the patients with hepatolithiasis presented with acute cholangitis, and two-thirds of those without hepatolithiasis presented with hepatomegaly. The rate of hepatic resection was 29.6% (48 of 162), and these rates were 31.1% and 26.8% for the patients with and without hepatolithiasis, respectively. Ninety-three percent of the patients with hepatolithiasis underwent common bile duct exploration, compared with 18% of those without hepatolithiasis. The surgical mortality rates were 3.7% (6/ 162), for all patients, and 3.8% and 3.6% for patients with and without hepatolithiasis, respectively. The morbidity rate was much higher in the patients with hepatolithiasis (37.7% vs 16.1%). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 35.5%, 20.5%, and 16.5% in the patients with hepatolithiasis and 27.2%, 8.8%, and 7.8% in those without hepatolithiasis. Concomitant hepatolithiasis prevented precise diagnosis preoperatively and precipitated biliary sepsis, which affected resectability and increased postoperative morbidity. Hepatolithiasis per se did not influence long-term survival. © Springer-Verlag 1999.

0029857220	Surgical Treatment of Gastric Outlet Obstruction after Corrosive Injury - Can Early Definitive Operation be Used Instead of Staged Operation?	For the comparison of advantage and outcome, thirty six patients with corrosive upper GI injury resulting in only distal gastric outlet obstruction and failing to receive endoscopic balloon dilatation underwent prospective randomized different surgical treatments in the past years. Sixteen patients (Group A) received early definitive treatment with antrectomy or pyloroplasty for their gastric outlet obstruction, only 3 (18.8%) of them needed a second operation for the delayed esophageal stricture. The long-term follow-up for these patients revealed the stricture resolved after the antrectomy or pyloroplasty. All of the other 20 patients (Group B) who received gastrostomy plus feeding jejunostomy during their first operation required a second operation. Among the 20 patients receiving a second operation, delayed esophageal stricture was the reason in only 4 patients. It meant that 16 patients (80%) of Group B were able to avoid the second operation if early definitive treatment for their gastric outlet obstruction was performed during the first operation. We concluded that the early definitive treatment of gastric outlet obstruction can give patients a better quality of life, avoid a second operation in about 80% of them and save operative time in those who need a second operation for final esophageal reconstruction.

0029864382	Secural pancreaticojejunal anastomosis for the pancreaticoduodenectomy	Background/Aims: This report presents the results of two methods for minimizing complications following a Whipple operation. Materials and Methods: In the past five years, continuous duct to mucosal suture with end to side anastomosis of the pancreaticojejunostomy was utilized in 30 patients. Another 50 patients received interrupted duct to mucosal suturing with end to side anastomosis of the pancreaticojejunostomy in the past five to ten years. Results: None of the first set of 30 patients suffered leakage after the operation. Ten of the 50 patients (20%) developed leakage postoperatively and 3 (6%) died. The group with continuous duct to mucosal suture had significantly less complications than those with interrupted duct to mucosal suturing (P<0.05). Late follow up of the patients with continuous duct to mucosal suture using echogram, no one had stricture of the anastomosis. Conclusions: The continuous duct to mucosal suture of the pancreaticojejunostomy is a very safe procedure, minimizing the operative morbidity and mortality of the Whipple operation.

0029891442	Surgical Treatment of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: Taiwan Experience	A retrospective study of 155 patients with tissue proven ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated between January 1981 and December 1991 was performed. Locations of the pancreatic tumors were: pancreatic head in 109 cases (70.3%), head and body or diffusely throughout the gland in 24 patients (15.5%), body and/or tail in another 22 (14.2%). All of the patients were stratified by TNM staging (I, 13.6%; II, 8.4%; III, 34.8%; IV, 43.2%). Twenty-eight patients received pancreatectomies (18.1%), 87 patients had biliary-enteric bypass and/or gastrojejunostomies (56.1%), and another 40 received laparotomies with tumor biopsy only (25.8%). The overall operative mortality of pancreatic cancer surgery was 9.0% with the pancreatectomy, bypass, laparotomy group mortalities at 7.1%, 5.7%, and 17.5% respectively. The risk factors of postoperative mortality were age ≥70 years, serum albumin 3.0 g% and hemoglobulin <12.0 g% (p<0.05). The overall long term survival for pancreatic cancer was: 1y, 17.1%; 2y, 8.5%; 3y, 7.6%; 4y, 5.7%; and 5y, 4.8%; respectively. The mean survival time for the resection group was 23.6M (range 1-108M) with survival rates being: 1y, 42.3%; 2y, 34.6%; 3y, 30.8%; 4y,23.1%; and 5y, 19.2%; respectively. Stage I cancer and radical resection are two important factors related to long-term survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

0030001480	Factors influencing survival after hepatectomy for peripheral cholangiocarcinoma	Background/Aims: Radical resection for patients with peripheral cholangiocarcinoma is rare. Prognostic factors related to survival with peripheral cholangiocarcinoma after hepatectomy have not yet been reported. Materials and Methods: Of 41 hepatectomized patients with peripheral cholangiocarcinoma, a computer analysis of 14 clinicopathological factors on patients survival was performed with univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Median and mean survival times for patients with peripheral cholangiocarcinoma after hepatectomy were 12.0 and 22.8 months. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year survival rates were 53.7%, 39.0%, 36.6%, 26.8%, and 26.8% respectively. Univariate analysis of overall survival involving all patients identified 7 factors that were associated with a significantly outcome: mucobilia (p = 0.043), capsular invasion (p = 0.007), tumor spreading type (p = 0.0003), section margin (p = 0.001), histologic type (p = 0.008), macroscopic and microscopic vascular involvement (p = 0.031), and Lymphatic invasion (p = 0.004). With multivariate analysis using the COX stepwise proportional hazards model, only mucobilia, tremor spreading type and section margin were significantly related to prognosis. Conclusions: Intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma patients with mucobilia, intraductal papillomatosis margin after hepatectomy had a better prognosis.

0029792251	Surgical treatment of hepatolithiasis: Long-term results	Background. Hepatolithiasis is a common disease in East Asia and is prevalent in Taiwan. Surgical and nonsurgical procedures for management of hepatolithiasis have been discussed, but long-term follow-up results of surgical treatment of hepatolithiasis are rarely reported. Methods. We conducted a retrospective study of case records of patients with hepatolithiasis who underwent surgical or nonsurgical percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy treatment. Of 614 patients with hepatolithiasis seen between January 1984 and December 1988, 427 underwent follow-up after surgical (380) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (47) treatment for 4 to 10 years and constituted the basis of this study. Results. Long-term results of 427 patients with hepatolithiasis after surgical and nonsurgical treatment within 4 to 10 years follow-up were recurrent stone rate 29.6% (105 of 355), repeated operation 18.7% (80 of 427), secondary biliary cirrhosis 6.8% (29 of 427), late development of cholangiocarcinoma 2.8% (12 of 427), and mortality rate 10.3% (44 of 427). The patients with hepatectomy had a better quality of life (symptom-free) with a lower recurrent stone rate (9.5%), lower mortality rate (2.1%), and lower incidence of secondary biliary cirrhosis (2.1%) and cholangiocarcinoma (0%) than did the nonhepatectomy group (p < 0.01). The patients without residual stones after choledochoscopy had a better quality of life than did the residual stone group (p < 0.01). Conclusions. Long-term follow-up study of hepatolithiasis after surgical treatment revealed a high recurrent stone rate (29.6%) that required repeated surgery and a high mortality rate (10.3%) resulting from repeated cholangitis, secondary biliary cirrhosis, and late development of cholangiocarcinoma. Patients who received hepatectomy or without residual stones after choledochoscopy had a good prognosis and quality of life.

0029815749	Surgical results of corrosive injuries involving esophagus to jejunum	Background/Aim: Severe corrosive injury involving esophagus to jejunum remains an unique surgical problem which is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Material and Methods: Herein we report the outcomes of 28 caustic patients who underwent resections of the stomach, duodenum, a segment of jejunum, and adjacent involving organs. Results: In all of these patients except one, esophagectomy was also performed. The concomitant procedures included pancreaticojejunostomy (n = 24), choledochojejunosotmy (n = 4), cholecystostomy (n = 4), common bile duct or pancreatic duct drainage, feeding and drainage jejunostomies, and cervical esophagostomy. Major complications consisted of bile leakage (n = 10), bile-bronchial fistula (n = 2), internal bleeding due to vessel necrosis (n = 5), peritonitis (n = 4), acute renal failure (n = 4), and septicemia (n = 4). There were 13 hospital deaths (46.4%) and three late deaths. Eight out of 12 survivors underwent subsequent reconstruction of esophagus. The remaining four survivors depended on jejunostomy feeding. Conclusions: Early approaches and appropriate procedures can save a number of patients with corrosive injury involving esophagus to jejunum.

0030712957	Prognostic study of gastric cancer without serosal invasion: Reevaluation of the definition of early gastric cancer	Background: Early gastric cancer, a term defined by Japanese researchers in the 1960s, is equivalent to pT1 tumor stage regardless of nodal status. Recently, there were suggestions to exclude node-positive pT1 gastric cancer from this entity and to consider node-negative pT2 gastric cancer as early gastric cancer. Study Design: A survival analysis was conducted of 294 patients who underwent resection for gastric cancers confined within the gastric wall (pT1, n = 164; pT2, n = 130) between 1986 and 1992. Results: The cumulative 5-year survival rate was 93.5% for pT1 patients and 67.9% for pT2 patients, with an overall survival of 82.5%. There was a significant difference in the 5-year survival rate between node-positive and node- negative pT1 patients (72.8% versus 95.6%; p = 0.0095). The 5-year survival rate of node-negative pT2 patients (80.4%) was significantly worse than that of node-negative pT1 patients (p = 0.011) but was not significantly better than that of node-positive pT1 patients (p = 0.4). If excellent prognosis is a prerequisite for the definition of early gastric cancer, then node-positive pT1 cancer and node-negative pT2 cancer should not be considered early gastric cancer. Conclusions: In the 1990s, now that new imaging techniques such as endoscopic ultrasonography has been introduced, the preoperative staging of gastric cancer can be made more accurately than in the 1960s, when the term 'early gastric cancer' was defined. Because the prognosis of early gastric cancers, if subcategorized by nodal status, is not homogeneously excellent, a reevaluation of the definition of early gastric cancer may be necessary.

0030750948	Role of hepatic resection in surgery for bilateral intrahepatic stones	Background: Hepatic resection is the treatment of choice for unilateral intrahepatic stones. The availability of the flexible choledochoscope has greatly changed the management of intrahepatic stones. Little has been reported regarding hepatic resection for bilateral intrahepatic stones. Methods: Fifty-nine (15.1 per cent) of 392 patients with bilateral intrahepatic stones underwent hepatic resection. The indications and results were reported. Surgical outcome and long-term follow-up were analysed, and results were compared with those in patients not undergoing hepatectomy. Results: Fifty-nine patients underwent hepatic resection because of destruction of the left liver by repeated infection (n = 40), multiple cholangitic liver abscesses (n = 18) or associated intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1). The hospital mortality rate was 1.7 per cent. The majority of complications were wound infection (9 per cent), haematobilia (5 per cent) and biliary fistula (3 per cent). The incidence of residual stones after surgery was 60 per cent. One year after postoperative choledochoscopic stone extraction, the rate of complete stone clearance was 84 per cent. In patients who did not have hepatectomy the respective rates were 90.1 and 52.9 per cent. The recurrence rate for stones in the hepatectomy and no- hepatectomy groups was 12 and 33·0 per cent respectively. Conclusions: Compared with patients not undergoing hepatectomy, those having hepatic resection had similar operative risks, fewer residual stones and a low incidence of recurrent stones (P < 0·05).

0030835422	Massive extra-enteric gastrointestinal hemorrhage secondary to splanchnic artery aneurysms	Background/Aims: Gastrointestinal hemorrhages of obscure origin are often difficult to diagnose and manage. Of these, splanchnic artery aneurysms have emerged as an important disorder because of the increasing prevalence and formidable mortality rate associated with their rupture. We herein evaluated extra-enteric gastrointestinal bleeding related to these ruptured aneurysms. Methodology: The medical records of 17 patients with splanchnic artery aneurysms known to be exclusively manifested as gastrointestinal bleeding were reviewed. The pathogenesis, clinical picture, diagnostic tests, management, complications, and outcomes were compiled and analyzed. Results: Of the seventeen patients, 12 patients had true aneurysms; 5 patients had false aneurysms. Pancreatitis, trauma, iatrogenic hepatobiliary injury, and atherosclerosis were the four major etiologies. The sensitivity rates measured by endoscopy, ultrasonography, computed tomography and visceral angiography were 20%, 50%, 67%, and 100%, respectively. An exact diagnosis was attained in 94% of the patients at the time of management. Transcatheter embolization was employed in 7 patients, complicated with hepatic and splenic infarcts, and pyogenic liver abscesses in 2 instances. True patients had recurrent bleeding aneurysms post embolotherapy. Ten patients underwent surgical intervention which resulted in 2 cases of hepatic failure. One out of 5 patients with a true aneurysm died, while 4 out of 12 patients with false aneurysms eventually died. Overall, the mortality rate was 29%. Conclusion: Even though the exact diagnosis cart be made in most of the patients by modern imaging studies, the mortality rate was still formidable, especially in patients with false aneurysms, in whom the underlying causal diseases substantially influenced the major outcome.

0030866722	Ductal carcinoma of the distal pancreas	Thirty-six patients with ductal carcinoma of the distal pancreas treated between January 1981 and April 1995 were retrospectively reviewed. Tumours were located in the body in 13 patients (36.1%), body and tail in 11 patients (30.6%) and tail in 12 patients (33.3%). All patients were grouped using the TNM staging system (I, 8.3%; II, 5.5%; III, 33.3%; IV, 52.8%). Distal gland pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed in 10 patients, with a resectability of 27.8%. The overall operative mortality of distal gland cancers was 8.3%, with 0% and 11.5% operative mortality in the pancreatectomy group and non-pancreatectomy group, respectively. Overall operative complication rate was 16.7%, comprising 40% from the resection group and 7.7% from the non-resection group. The overall one-, two-, three-, four- and five-year survivals for ductal carcinoma of the distal pancreas were 6.9%, 3.5%, 3.5%, 3.5% and 3.5%, respectively. In the resectable group, the mean and median survival time was 9.7 months and 3.1 months, respectively, and the one-, two-, three-, four- and five-year survival rates were all 11%.

0030444023	Surgical treatment of choledochal cyst in adults: Results and long-term follow-up	Background/Aims: Results of the surgical management of 60 adults with choledochal cysts at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Taipei are presented. Patients and Methods: All patients were diagnosed and surgically managed during the period between March 1979 and December 1992. There were 47 females and 13 males, with ages ranging from 16 to 81 years (mean age= 31.9 years). Of the total, there were 41 Type I, one Type II, 14 Type IV, and four Type V choledochal cysts classified according to Todani's classification system. The definite surgical procedures were cyst excision, and hepatico-jejunostomy in 43 cases in type I and IV diseases, one cyst excision, in type II disease, two hepatectomy for type V disease, cyst enterostomy in, seven cases, and T-tube choledochocystostomy in, seven cases. Results: The operative mortality rate was 3.3% and the complication rate related to the surgical procedure was 20%. Early postoperative complications include wound infection, leakage of anastomosis, acute pancreatitis, septic shock, left pleural effusion, and intra-abdominal abscessing. Reoperations were needed in the early postoperative days in, two cases due to hepatico-jejunostomy leakage and intraabdominal abscess formation. Long-term surgical outcome, concerning recurrence of symptoms, was related to the following factors, excluding the factors of surgery: presence of bile duct lithiasis, common channel less than 22 mm, presence of preoperative pancreatitis and acute angle type pancreaticobiliary unions. Only common channel less than 22 mm is statistically significant. The percentage of recurrence of the symptoms after resectional surgery was 32.5% in, the long term follow-up period. Most of the cases responded well to an antibiotics treatment. Three of the cases required a second operation or PTCD as well as dilatation to treat the recurrent cholangitis. Conclusion: Although the recurrence of symptoms is not uncommon and satisfactory explanation of the analysed factors is very difficult now, the resectional surgery is still the treatment of choice for adult patients with choledochal cysts.

0030453158	Peritoneal nitric oxide is a marker of peritonitis in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis	Nitric oxide plays an important role in mediating the inflammatory process. The aim of this study was to evaluate if nitric oxide production was increased during peritonitis in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and the association with the prognosis. The study population comprised 21 patients with 22 episodes of peritonitis. Fifteen patients without peritonitis were controls. Nitrate was measured by HPLC and nitrite by the Griess method, to reflect nitric oxide production. Peritoneal dialysate effluent and plasma were collected from six patients during peritonitis and 1 week after treatment to study changes in dialysate:plasma ratio. In 15 patients, nitrite was measured during peritonitis and every 3 days for 2 weeks or until normalized for evolutional changes. The dialysate:plasma ratios of nitrate and nitrite during peritonitis were reduced 26% and 41.5%, respectively, after 1 week of treatment, indicating the peritoneal production of nitric oxide during peritonitis. In the evolutional study, a 5.1-fold increase of peak nitrite levels in bacterial peritonitis (n = 13) and a 2.5-fold increase in fungal peritonitis (n = 3) were observed compared to controls. Nitrite gradually declined to control levels (9.3 ± 7.2 days) after effective antibiotic treatment, but took longer than to normalize leukocyte count in the peritoneal dialysate effluent (3.9 ± 1.9 days). In four patients with refractory peritonitis (Candida infection in three, Acinetobacter infection in one), the nitrite levels remained elevated 2-fold despite treatment, and the catheters were removed. It is concluded that nitrite levels in peritoneal dialysate effluent may serve as a marker to assess treatment efficacy in CAPD patients with peritonitis.

0030961776	Changes of adenosine triphosphate-dependent calcium uptake in microsomal fractions of rat liver during sepsis	Background. Intracellular calcium concentration is an important regulator of cellular metabolism. Endoplasmic reticulum membranes play an important role in the regulation of cytoplasmic calcium in the mammalian liver. The characterization of the changes of calcium uptake in endoplasmic reticulum may contribute to the potential intracellular mechanisms for cellular dysfunction during sepsis. Methods. The effects of sepsis on the calcium uptake in rough endoplasmic reticulum of rat liver were studied. Sepsis was induced by means of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The control rats underwent sham operation. Microsomal fractions were isolated from the liver with differential centrifugation. Results. The calcium uptake by liver endoplasmic reticulum was decreased by 30% to 35% (p < 0.05) during early sepsis (9 hours after CLP) and by 38% to 43% (p < 0.05) during late sepsis (18 hours after CLP), respectively.

0031079836	Pancreaticojejunal anastomotic leak after pancreaticoduodenectomy - Multivariate analysis of perioperative risk factors	The records of 131 consecutive patients with periampullary carcinoma who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy within a 12-year period were reviewed to determine the perioperative risk factors of pancreaticojejunal (PJ) anastomotic leak. Twenty-one PJ leaks were identified, for a frequency of 16% (21 of 131); 19% (4 of 21) of these patients eventually died of PJ leak- related complications. A total of 23 items of perioperative data, presumed as risk factors predisposing to PJ leak, were examined. By univariate analysis, advanced age, prolonged duration of untreated jaundice, deep jaundice, decreased creatinine clearance, increased intraoperative blood loss, and shock during operation were statistically significant. However, by multivariate analysis, only duration of jaundice, creatinine clearance, and intraoperative blood loss turned out to be independent risk factors. Noteworthily, jaundiced patients with impaired creatinine clearance not only had a higher incidence of PJ leak, but were also more liable to experience sepsis and intraabdominal bleeding, which uniformly elicited a grave clinical course. Routine preoperative biliary drainage failed to enhance the security of PJ. Completion pancreatectomy continued to carry a poor prognosis, and should be avoided when possible and replaced by early, aggressive radiologic intervention.

0031715991	Concurrent primary carcinoma of the gallbladder and acute cholecystitis	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Primary carcinoma of the gallbladder is rare and associated with a late diagnosis and poor prognosis. Concurrent acute cholecystitis frequently obscures the presence of carcinoma. The information regarding gallbladder carcinoma with acute cholecystitis is limited. In order to better understand the presentation of gallbladder carcinoma with acute cholecystitis, we retrospectively reviewed the data of patients with primary carcinoma of the gallbladder. METHODOLOGY: The data of 86 patients with primary carcinoma of the gallbladder treated between 1979 and 1994 were compiled and reviewed. The patients were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (with acute cholecystitis, 21 patients) and Group 2 (without cholecystitis, 65 patients). Clinicopathological comparisons were made and evaluated between these two groups RESULTS: The average age of Group 1 patients was older than that of Group 2 patients (75 ± 2 years vs. 63 ± 2 years; p < 0.05). Three Group 1 patients presented with sepsis. The interval between the onset of symptoms and hospital admission in Group 2 patients was significantly (p < 0.05) longer than that in Group 1 patients (243 ± 95 days vs. 20 ± 11 days).

0031398795	Intraoperative ultrasound-guided excisional biopsy for nonpalpable breast lesions	Between March 1993 and October 1995, nonpalpable breast lesions in 101 patients were excised under intraoperative ultrasound examination at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. The clinical indications for breast ultrasound examination included breast nodularity, fibrocystic changes, bleeding nipples, breast dominant masses and patients who had one-side mastectomy for breast cancer. The mean age of the patients was 42 years old. In 60 cases the lesions was located in the left breast, while three patients had bilateral nonpalpable breast lesions. The average tumor size was 1.13x0.8 cm. Forty-one patients had x-ray mammography but only nine of those patients demonstrated a mass, and eight patients showed microcalcifications. The pathology revealed that 40 cases were benign tumors, 45 were fibrocystic changes, eight cases of intraductal papilloma, seven were cases of malignancy and one patient had a phyllodes tumor. For the seven nonpalpable breast cancers, the average size was 1.15x0.98 cm. Of these seven, only one patient presented with microcalcification and another with a mass lesion on mammography. The nonpalpable tumors were located 1.14 cm below the skin of the breast, significantly deeper than the palpable tumors (0.58 cm). Breast ultrasound is not only indicated for palpable tumors to differentiate cysts from solid tumors, and benign lesions from malignant, but it is also necessary for every high risk asymptomatic Chinese woman. The intraoperative ultrasound-guided excisional biopsy is an effective and accurate procedure for the diagnosis of nonpalpable breast lesions.

0032426963	Clinical analysis of inflammatory masses of the pancreatic head region	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Inflammatory masses of the pancreatic head are a dilemma for surgeons, especially when the differences between these lesions and pancreatic head carcinoma are not so clear. The surgical management of these inflammatory benign lesions is also a topic with conflicting opinions. A clinical analysis was performed in an attempt to differentiate between these lesions and malignancy. The results of our observatory strategy of these lesions are also presented. METHODOLOGY: From 1992 to 1994, 73 patients with ultrasonographically (US) or computed tomographically (CT) heterogenous pancreatic head lesions were diagnosed at the Department of Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. Forty-nine of these lesions were neoplastic (Group I), but the remaining 24 patients had inflammatory non-neoplastic lesions (pancreatic inflammatory masses, IPM, Group II), which were diagnosed during laparotomy by core needle biopsy. Surgery and outcome were reviewed. Ten of the 24 patients in group II received biopsy only, and the remaining 14 patients received bypass procedures. At follow-up of at least 16 months of the surviving patients (n = 21), only 9.5% were with residual lesions. All cases in group II revealed shrinkage of masses. We focused on the clinical features, hematology, biochemistry, image study, serum CEA and CA 19-9, and compared these variances between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Three clinical features were statistically different between groups I and II: mean age at presentation of disease (group I vs II = 53.3 vs 65.1), the tendency of a past history of alcoholism (Group II), and presence of abdominal pain (Group II). Group II also showed a higher level of serum alkaline phosphatase and a lower level of total bilirubin as well as a lower level of CA19-9. These inflammatory masses could not be distinguished from the true neoplasms pre-operatively on endoscopic appearance, US, or CT. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative differentiation between these pancreatic lesions may be difficult but laparotomy and core needle biopsy remain safe and reliable procedures. Our short-term follow-up justified the bypass surgery and that observatory strategy is enough for those patients with pancreatic head inflammatory masses.

27144480324	Adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas	Background/Aims: Adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) of the pancreas is rare and correct preoperative diagnosis is difficult. Case reports of ASC of the pancreas are sporadic and have typically employed small series. This study investigated the clinicopathological features of 7 cases of ASC of the pancreas and reviewed the pertinent literature to elucidate this rare disease. Methodology: Seven patients (4 men and 3 women; age range 38-79 years; median 66 years) with ASC of the pancreas who underwent surgical treatment at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between February 1993 and April 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Symptoms of ASC were as follows: abdominal pain (85.7%), body weight loss (85.7%), jaundice (42.9%) and anorexia (42.9%). The tumors were located at the head of the pancreas in 4 patients (57.1%), at the body in 2, and at the tail in 2. One patient had ASC at the body and tail. Most cases (5/7, 71.4%) were anemic. Seven (100%) and 5 patients (71.4%) had elevated serum CEA and CA19-9 levels, respectively. Curative pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed on 2 patients, bypass surgery on 3, and exploratory laparotomy on 2. Two patients underwent intraoperative radiotherapy. Three patients received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. No surgical mortality or morbidity occurred. Five of 7 patients (71.4%) died within 6 months after surgery. The median survival of the 7 patients was 4.41 months (range 1.12-22.42). Conclusions: Patients with ASC present symptoms similar to those of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Most patients had dismal prognosis despite aggressive surgery with or without adjuvant therapy. Copyright © 2005 S. Karger AG.

28844455651	Comparison of resected and non-resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas	By comparing the clinicopathological features and survivals between the resected and non-resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas, this study tried to clarify the natural history of IPMNs, to provide a strategy for treatment, and to determine the justification of not performing resection for some patients. A total of 57 patients with IPMN, including 39 resected and 18 non-resected IPMNs, were recruited for study. Data on demographics, clinical presentations, diagnostic work-up, treatment modality, clinical course, and outcomes were evaluated and compared between the resected and non-resected IPMNs. The most common clinical presentation was abdominal pain (57% in total IPMNs, 67% in resected, 33% in non-resected), followed by body weight loss (32% in total IPMNs, 33% in resected, 28% in non-resected). The sensitivity in the diagnosis of IPMN was highest by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (88%), followed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (68%), and computed tomography scan (CT scan) (42%) and sonography (10%). The median survival was 21.5 months for patients with resected IPMNs, ranging from 2 to 124 months, and 14 months in non-resected IPMN patients, ranging from 5.5 to 70 months. There is no significant survival difference between the resected and non-resected groups, with a 5-year survival of 69.8% in resected IPMNs and 59.8% in non-resected IPMNs, P = 0.347. The survival outcome of the unresectable non-resected IPMNs was much inferior to the resected IPMNs, P = 0.002 and resectable non-resected IPMNs, P = 0.001. Thus, the prime prognostic factor in predicting the survival outcome of IPMNs is resectability, instead of resection itself. Long-term survival could also be expected in resectable IPMNs without resection. No resection for the IPMN may be justified for patients with high surgical risks, especially for those who are asymptomatic and very aged. © 2005 by the Société Internationale de Chirurgie.

27644454838	Identifying good prognosis group of breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive axillary nodes for adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy	Objective: We conducted a retrospective analysis of prognosis factors for survival in breast cancer patients with 1-3 axillary lymph node metastases and tried to identify a subset of patients with good prognosis suitable for cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: A cohort of 446 breast cancer patients received definite surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from 1990 to 1998. They were enrolled in the study. The median follow-up time was 69 months. Prognostic factors including age, tumor size, number of involved nodes, steroid receptor status, tumor ploidy, synthetic-phase fraction, histologic grade and administration of tamoxifen were analysed for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) by Cox regression model. Results: The estimated 5 year OS and DFS for all patients were 85.4 and 71.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor size, age and estrogen receptor (ER) status were independent prognostic factors for OS, and tumor size, age, ER status and number of involved nodes were independent prognostic factors for DFS. The 5 year OS rates of the low-risk group (age >40, tumor ≤3 cm and positive ER) and average-risk group (either age ≤40, tumor >3 cm or negative ER) were 98.8 and 82.4%, respectively (P = 0.0001). The 5 year DFS of the low-risk and high-risk group were 88.2 and 67.7%, respectively (P = 0.0001). Conclusion: Among breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes excellent survival rate was found in those who had favorable prognostic factors, including age >40, tumor size ≤3 cm and positive ER. Adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF regimen is optimal for these low-risk patients. © 2005 Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research.

27744528805	Clinicopathological factors predicting long-term overall survival after hepatectomy for peripheral cholangiocarcinoma	Peripheral cholangiocarcinoma (PCC) is clinically challenging because patients typically do not present until the disease is relatively advanced. Three-year to 5-year survival rates even with resection thus remain dismal. This study aimed to determine the clinicopathological factors for predicting overall survival longer than 5 years in PCC patients treated with hepatectomy. From 1977 to 1997, the clinicopatholgical features of 11 PCC patients who underwent hepatectomy with long-term overall survival (group A) were reviewed. Comparison was made with the clinical features and factors influencing the outcome of 70 PCC patients who survived less than S years after hepatectomy (group B). Of 81 PCC patients undergoing hepatectomy, 11 (13.6%) were 5-year survivors. The 81 PCC patients comprised 32 men and 49 women, with a mean age of 56.0 years (range: 34-83 years). Univariate analysis showed that female gender, absence of physical findings, a higher percentage of presence of mucobilia, early staged tumor, intraductal papillary tumor growth, and curative hepatic resection were more frequent in group A patients than group B patients. However, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that absence of physical findings, presence of mucobilia, early staged tumor, and curative hepatic resection were the four independent factors differentiating group A from B patients. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates of the group A patients were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 40%, whereas those of the group B patients were 46.0%, 9.5%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. Absence of physical findings, presence of mucobilia, early staged tumor, and curative hepatectomy could independently predict PCC patients with long-term overall survival after hepatectomy. © 2005 by the Société Internationale de Chirurgie.

28844436511	Primary angiosarcoma of the spleen	Background and Objectives: Primary splenic angiosarcoma is a very rare and aggressive neoplasm with a high metastatic rate and dismal prognosis. Since only a few cases have been adequately reported in the medical literature, we report here a further six cases. Methods: The records of all cases of primary splenic angiosarcoma treated at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from April 1991 to July 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Of the six cases identified (three men and three women; range, 7-69 years; median, 44 years), four presented with palpable abdominal masses or left upper quadrant abdominal pain. Other systemic symptoms, such as bleeding gums, fatigue, fever, body weight loss, and gastrointestinal bleeding were noted. An abnormal hematogram was found in five patients, with all of these five showing anemia, and three thrombocytopenia. Splenomegaly was present in all patients. Hemoperitoneum due to splenic rupture was noted in one patient. Three patients had distant metastasis to the liver (n = 2), bone (n = 1), bone marrow (n = 1), and small bowel (n = 1) at diagnosis. Liver (n = 3), bone (n = 1), and bone marrow (n = 1) metastases were found in four patients after initial therapy. Five of the six cases underwent a splenectomy, one underwent partial hepatectomy, and one received chemotherapy. The respective 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 60%, 40%, and 40%, and the median survival time was 36 months. One patient was disease-free 162 months after splenectomy. Conclusions: The clinical presentations of splenic angiosarcoma were similar to those of previous reports apart from the higher rate of splenomegaly observed in this study. In contrast to reported pediatric cases, our patient achieved long-term disease-free survival after splenectomy alone. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

31344436482	Splenic angiosarcoma metastasis to small bowel presented with gastrointestinal bleeding	Primary splenic angiosarcoma is a very rare, aggressive neoplasm with a high metastatic rate and dismal prognosis. This neoplasm usually presents with abdominal pain, splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Splenic angiosarcoma with bleeding gastrointestinal metastases is extremely rare. The literature contains only two case reports. This study reported a 44-year-old male patient with splenic angiosarcoma with sustained repeated gastrointestinal bleeding due to small bowel metastases. Salvage surgery was performed by splenectomy and resection of the metastatic small bowel tumors. The post-operative course was uneventful; the patient survived with the disease and had no GI bleeding, 7 mo after surgery. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

32644435012	Detection of rare mutant K-ras DNA in a single-tube reaction using peptide nucleic acid as both PCR clamp and sensor probe	The major problem of using somatic mutations as markers of malignancy is that the clinical samples are frequently containing a trace amounts of mutant allele in a large excess of wild-type DNA. Most methods developed thus far for the purpose of tickling this difficult problem require multiple procedural steps that are laborious. We report herein the development of a rapid and simple protocol for detecting a trace amounts of mutant K-ras in a single tube, one-step format. In a capillary PCR, a 17mer peptide nucleic acid (PNA) complementary to the wild-type sequence and spanning codons 12 and 13 of the K-ras oncogene was used to clamp-PCR for wild-type, but not mutant alleles. The designated PNA was labeled with a fluorescent dye for use as a sensor probe, which differentiated all 12 possible mutations from the wild-type by a melting temperature (T

33645277428	Outcome of pancreaticoduodenectomy for chronic pancreatitis	Background and Purpose: Some patients with chronic pancreatitis may require surgery, mainly because of disabling medically intractable pain, suspicion of malignancy or complications related to chronic pancreatitis. This study analyzed the efficacy of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for patients with chronic pancreatitis in terms of pain relief, control of local complications and pancreatic endocrine/exocrine function. Methods: This retrospective analysis included 24 consecutive patients with chronic pancreatitis who received PD from April 1995 to March 2003. There were 21 men and 3 women. The age of the patients ranged from 21 years to 73 years, with a mean age of 44 years. Alcohol abuse, found in 14 patients (58.3%), was the most common predisposing factor. Local complications included stenosis of the pancreatic duct in 15 patients, biliary obstruction in 9, duodenal obstruction in 4 and left-sided portal hypertension in 1. The surgical indications were recurrent intractable pain (n = 16), local complications (n = 18), and suspicion of malignancy (n = 6). Endocrine pancreatic function was assessed by the need to treat diabetes mellitus with dietary modification, oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin. Pancreatic exocrine function was assessed based on clinical symptoms. Pain severity was evaluated using a scoring system based on the use of analgesic medication. The mean duration of follow-up in 22 of 24 patients was 31 months, with a range of 4 to 90 months. Results: Preoperatively, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency was detected in 3 patients (3/24, 12.5%), exocrine insufficiency in 5 (5/24, 20.8%) and intractable abdominal pain requiring morphine injection in 16 (16/24, 66.7%). After PD, 4 patients had 5 complications, resulting in a morbidity rate of 17% and a mortality rate of 4%. Postoperative diabetes mellitus developed de novo in 3 patients (3/20,15%) and postoperative pancreatic exocrine insufficiency was detected in 14 patients ( 14/22, 63.6%). Complete pain relief after surgery was noted in 12 patients (12/14,85.7%). Conclusions: In selected patients with chronic pancreatitis, PD is a safe procedure and can effectively relieve pain and control local complications. Deterioration of pancreatic endocrine function after PD was mainly related to disease progression. Pancreatic resection plays an important role in progressing pancreatic exocrine function.

33646094729	Management and outcome of bleeding pseudoaneurysm associated with chronic pancreatitis	Background: A bleeding pseudoaneurysm in patients with chronic pancreatitis is a rare and potentially lethal complication. Optimal treatment of bleeding peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm remains controversial. This study reports on experience at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) in managing of bleeding pseudoaneurysms associated with chronic pancreatitis. Methods: The medical records of 9 patients (8 males and 1 female; age range, 28-71 years; median, 36 years) with bleeding pseudoaneurysms associated with chronic pancreatitis treated at CGMH between Aug. 1992 and Sep. 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. Alcohol abuse (n = 7;78%) was the predominant predisposing factor. Diagnoses of bleeding pseudoaneurysms were based on angiographic (7/7), computed tomographic (4/7), ultrasound (2/5), and surgical (2/2) findings. Whether surgery or angiographic embolization was performed was primarily based on patient clinical condition. Median follow-up was 38 months (range, 4-87 months). Results: Abdominal computed tomography revealed bleeding pseudoaneurysm s in 4 of 7 patients (57%). Angiography determined correct diagnosis in 7 patients (7/7, 100%). The splenic artery was involved in 5 cases, the pancreaticoduodenal artery in 2, the gastroduodenal artery in 1, and the middle colic artery in 1. Initial treatment was emergency (n = 4) or elective (n = 3) surgery in 7 patients and arterial embolization in 2. Rebleeding was detected after initial treatment in 3 patients. Overall, 5 arterial embolizations and 9 surgical interventions were performed; the respective rates of success of these treatments were 20% (1/5) and 89% (8/9). Five patients developed pseudocysts before treatment (n = 3) or following intervention (n = 2). Pseudocyst formation was identified in 2 of the 3 rebleeding patients. Five patients underwent surgical treatment for associated pseudocysts and bleeding did not recur. One patient died from angiography-related complications. Overall mortality rate was 11% (1/9). Surgery-related mortality was 0%. Conclusion: Angiography is valuable in localizing bleeding pseudoaneurysms. In this limited series, patients with bleeding pseudoaneurysms associated with chronic pancreatitis treated surgically seemingly obtained good outcomes. © 2006 Hsu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

33748861797	Postsurgical infections are reduced with specialized nutrition support	Objective: The objective was to examine the relationship between pre-, peri-, and postoperative specialized nutritional support with immune-modulating nutrients and postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing elective surgery. Methods: Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, review article bibliographies, and abstracts and proceedings of scientific meetings. All randomized clinical trials in which patients were supplemented by the IMPACT formula before and/or after elective surgery and the clinical outcomes reported were included in the meta-analysis. Seventeen studies (n = 2,305), 14 published (n = 2,102), and 3 unpublished (n = 203), fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Ten studies (n = 1,392) examined the efficacy of pre- or perioperative IMPACT supplementation in patients undergoing elective surgery, whereas 7 (n = 913) assessed postoperative efficacy. Fourteen of the studies (n = 2,083) involved gastrointestinal (GI) surgical patients. Postoperative complications, mortality, and length of stay in hospital (LOS) were major outcomes of interest. Results: IMPACT supplementation, in general, was associated with significant (39%-61%) reductions in postoperative infectious complications and a significant decrease in LOS in hospital by an average of 2 days. The greatest improvement in postoperative outcomes was observed in patients receiving specialized nutrition support as part of their preoperative treatment. In GI surgical patients, anastomotic leaks were 46% less prevalent when IMPACT supplementation was part of the preoperative treatment. Conclusion: This study identifies a dosage (0.5-1 l/day) and duration (supplementation for 5-7 days before surgery) of IMPACT that contributes to improved outcomes of morbidity in elective surgery patients, particularly those undergoing GI surgical procedures. The cost effectiveness of such practice is supported by recent health economic analysis. Findings suggest preoperative IMPACT use for the prophylaxis of postoperative complications in elective surgical patients. © 2006 by the Société Internationale de Chirurgie.

33750735002	Surgical treatment and prognostic analysis for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the small intestine: Before the era of imatinib mesylate	Background: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), the most common type of mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, demonstrate positive kit staining. We report our surgical experience with 100 small intestine GIST patients and identify predictors for long-term disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) to clarify the difference between high- and low-risk patients. Methods: The clinicopathologic and follow-up records of 100 small intestine GIST patients who were treated at Chung Gung Memorial Hospital between 1983 and 2002 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical and pathological factors were assessed for long-term DFS and OS by using a univariate log-rank test and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Results: The patients included 52 men and 48 women. Their ages ranged from 27 to 82 years. Among the 85 patients who underwent curative resection, 44 (51.8%) developed disease recurrence (liver metastasis was the most common form of recurrence). The follow-up period ranged from 5 to 202 months (median: 33.2 months). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS and OS rates were 85.2%, 53.8%, and 43.7%, and 91.5%, 66.6%, and 50.5%, respectively. Using multivariate analysis, it was found that high tumor cellularity, mitotic count >5/50 high-power field, and a Ki-67 index ≥10% were three independent factors that were inversely associated with DFS. However, absence of tumor perforation, mitotic count < 5/50 high power field, and tumor with low cellularity were predictors of long-term favorable OS. Conclusion: Tumors with low cellularity, low mitotic count, and low Ki-67 index, which indicate low risk, predict a more favorable DFS for small intestine GIST patients undergoing curative resection. Absence of tumor perforation with low mitotic count and low cellularity, which indicates low risk, can predict long-term OS for small intestine GIST patients who have undergone curative resection. © 2006 Wu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

34248164447	Clinicopathological study of solid and pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas: Emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging findings	Aim: To report the clinicopathological features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of solid and pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of pancreas. Methods: From 1981 to 2005, 26 surgically treated cases of SPT were retrospectively reviewed. MRI findings of the latest 11 consecutive SPT cases were investigated. Results: There were 25 women and one man having SPT (median age: 23 year) with a median tumor size of 7.5 cm. Among them, nine patients developed solid pseudopapillary carcinoma. During the median follow-up period of 66 mo, the 5-year survival rate of the 26 SPT patients was 96.2%. Three MRI features were proposed including Type 1 image, displaying SPT with completely solid part. All SPT patients with type 1 image were detected incidentally. Type 2 image displays of SPT with solid mass hemorrhage and type 3 image with massive hemorrhage. All the eight SPT patients with type 2 and 3 images suffered abdominal pain due to hemorrhage from SPT. Conclusion: SPT had a favorable survival rate irrespective of surgical procedures, malignancy, and MRI findings, however, MRI could reliably correlate with its clinicopathological features. © 2007 The WJG Press.

34547113304	Primary angiosarcoma of the spleen in a child with long-term survival	Primary angiosarcoma of the spleen is a very rare and aggressive neoplasm with poor prognosis. Splenic angiosarcoma rarely occurs in the pediatric group (18 years or younger). Survival duration for pediatric patients is very limited. We report a 7-year-old boy with splenic angiosarcoma presented with left upper quadrant abdominal pain and a palpable abdominal mass. Hematogram revealed anemia. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous mass about 12 cm in diameter in the left upper abdomen. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated a huge heterogeneous mass with some cystic components closely attached to the spleen. Splenectomy was performed. Histological examination of the surgical specimen showed that this tumor had typical feature of angiosarcoma including vasoformative architecture, highly pleomorphic tumor cells with irregular, hyperchromatic and prominent nucleoli, and some mitosis. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was disease free at 16 years after surgery. This is the longest reported duration of survival in a patient with splenic angiosarcoma. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

35448981495	Pancreaticoduodenectomy versus Frey's procedure for chronic pancreatitis: Preliminary data on outcome and pancreatic function	Purpose. Several surgical treatments have been proposed for treating chronic pancreatitis (CP), including standard pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), pylorus-preserving PD, Beger's procedure, and Frey's procedure; however, few studies have compared pre- and postoperative pancreatic function in patients undergoing surgery for CP. Methods. Between 1996 and 2003, 42 patients with CP underwent pancreatic head resection; as PD in 17 and as Frey's procedure in 25. Frey's procedure was chosen if the pancreatic duct was dilated more than 5mm. We conducted this prospective, nonrandomized study to compare the pre- and postoperative status after PD or Frey's procedure by evaluating pancreatic function and symptom relief. Results. The demographic features, surgical morbidity, and mortality were similar in the two groups. Pancreatic exocrine function improved, pain subsided, and complications of the adjacent organs resolved after surgery in both groups. Similar postoperative endocrine and exocrine functional results were observed in both groups. Frey's procedure was associated with a significantly shorter hospital stay than PD (10.6 versus 15.4 days, respectively; (P < 0.0001)). Conclusion. There were no significant difference in operative time, surgical morbidity, or mortality rates between PD and Frey's procedure. Both procedures were equally effective in terms of pain relief, improvement of pancreatic exocrine function, and control of complications affecting the adjacent organs; however, Frey's procedure was associated with a significantly shorter hospital stay. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

0032727057	Jejunojejunal intussusception: Case report of a rare complication after internal drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst	Adult intussusception can usually be categorized as postoperative, tumor related or even idiopathic. It was relatively rare in comparison with its childhood counterpart. Postoperative intussusception is usually caused by adhesion, suture lines, bypassed intestine loops or abnormal motility of small bowels. We present a 57-year-old man who had severe alcoholic pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation. Cystogastrostomy and Roux-en-Y cystojejunostomy was created for internal drainage of pseudocyst. However, partial intestinal obstruction occurred as a late complication one year after operation and was found to be intussusception of defunctionalized limb of Roux-en-Y cystojejunostomy through jejunojejunostomy of Roux-en-Y reconstruction into normal jejunum. After manual reduction, resection of this diseased limb was performed and the patient recovered uneventfully. Neither polyps nor lymphadenopathy were found in that segment of the small bowel. The only possible leading point was a fibrotic adhesion band arising from anastomosis of cystojejunostomy to the mesocolon. This was a very rare complication of Roux-en-Y cystojejunostomy that has been reported before.

0033452109	Telomerase activity is a useful marker to distinguish malignant pancreatic cystic tumors from benign neoplasms and pseudocysts	Background. Pancreatic serous cystadenoma, mucinous cystic neoplasms, ductal adenocarcinoma with cystic change, and pseudocysts are a spectrum of pancreatic cystic lesions. Their management strategy and prognosis are extremely diverse. Imaging study, cytology, and analysis of the tumor markers of cyst fluid are not always reliable in differentiation of these disease entities. Materials and methods. Fifteen patients with pancreatic cystic neoplasms (including six mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, two mucinous cystic neoplasms with borderline malignancy, two mucinous cystadenomas, and five serous cystadenomas), 4 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas with cystic change, and 10 patients with pseudocysts were studied. Echo-guided or computed tomography-guided biopsies of pancreatic cystic lesions and their normal counterparts were conducted on all patients prior to operation or other management. The specimens were assayed for telomerase activity by using TRAP (telomere repeat amplification protocol). The level of telomerase activity in each specimen was semiquantitated as strong, moderate, weak, and none. The final diagnoses were made from histopathological examination of surgically resected or biopsied specimens. The efficacy of telomerase activity as a tumor marker to predict malignancy of pancreatic cystic lesions was evaluated. Results. Three of the four pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas with cystic change had strong or moderate telomerase activity; four of the six mucinous cystadenocarcinomas had moderate or weak telomerase activity; one of the two mucinous cystadenomas with borderline malignancy had weak telomerase activity; and none of their normal counterparts had detectable telomerase activity. In contrast, none of the two mucinous cystadenomas, five serous cystadenomas, and 10 pseudocysts had detectable telomerase activity. Based on these results, the sensitivity of telomerase activity for prediction of malignancy or premalignancy of pancreatic cystic lesions was 67%, the specificity was 100%, and the positive and negative predictive values were 1.0 and 0.81, respectively. The overall accuracy was 86%. Conclusions. The differential expressions of telomerase activity have been detected specifically in malignant and premalignant pancreatic cystic tumors, but not in benign cystic neoplasms or pseudocysts. The implications of these results are that telomerase activation takes part in the malignant transformation of pancreatic cystic neoplasms and that telomerase activity is a useful marker to distinguish malignant pancreatic cystic tumors from benign neoplasms and pseudocysts.

0033155415	The different manifestation and outcome between pancreatitis and pancreatic malignancy with left-sided portal hypertension	Left-sided portal hypertension can be induced by isolated splenic venous obstruction due to various etiologies, such as chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic malignancy. The patients may present with bleeding isolated gastric varices and hypersplenism in addition to their pancreatic lesions. In the past 3 years, we have encountered 24 patients with left-sided portal hypertension. They were diagnosed with an abdominal echogram, CT or splenoportography. Twelve patients had histories of acute pancreatitis for a few months to years. Eleven of them were found to have isolated gastric varices. Six of them underwent operation due to hypersplenism or pseudocyst. The postoperative courses were smooth and the gastric varices subsided after splenectomy. The other 12 patients with left-sided portal hypertension were diagnosed as having pancreatic malignancy. Only two of them were found to have isolated gastric varices. Seven of them received operations and only two patients with their tumors located at the pancreatic body and tail could be resected. The other 5 patients were diagnosed with abdominal CT and high serum CA 19-9. We concluded that the patients with left-sided portal hypertension can be suspected by isolated gastric varices without liver cirrhosis. The diagnosis can be confirmed by abdominal CT or splenoportography. The incidence of isolated gastric varices are significantly lower in the patients with pancreatic malignancy than those with chronic pancreatitis. The gastric varices subsided after splenectomy. The prognosis of pancreatic malignancy is poor and most of them are inoperable.

0032964254	Microvascular prefabricated free skin flaps for esophageal reconstruction in difficult patients	Background. Reconstruction of the esophagus for complicated benign stricture or after resection of malignant lesion is still a challenge for surgeons. When abdominal viscera cannot be used, skin flaps are selected for esophageal reconstruction. However, skin flaps for esophageal reconstruction are notorious for leakage, and have not been widely accepted. Prefabrication before microvascular transfer to its final site can improve the result of esophageal reconstruction when skin flaps are used. Methods. Eight patients with complicated corrosive esophagitis had been treated with prefabricated skin flaps for esophageal reconstruction. The procedures are described in detail. Results. All patients healed well without leakage. The barium study showed smooth passage. There was no dysphasia or regurgitation after education. Pulmonary complication happened in only 1 patient. Revision for the distal anastomosis was required in 1 patient due to narrowing. When the skin tube is long, the patients need water (or soup) to facilitate swallowing and occasionally use their hand to help the food passage. This method has the following advantages: (1) healing of the long suture line before transfer to withstand the intestinal juice; (2) reliable viability in the distal part of the flap, especially when an extended length of the flap is required; (3) more length of stable tissue for two-layered, tension-free anastomosis at the junction of skin and gastrointestinal mucosa to prevent leakage; and (4) the flap can be placed in the substernal position to meet the aesthetic requirement of young patients. The disadvantage was the staged operations. However, after prefabrication the transfer becomes safe and free of leakage. The overall morbidity is minimal. Conclusions. In rare situations when skin flaps are used for esophageal reconstruction, prefabrication provides advantages over conventional one-stage methods, although it needs additional procedures. This method is a combination of conventional technique and microsurgery.

0032993655	Value of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in demonstrating major bile duct injuries following laparoscopic cholecystectomy	Background: Conventionally, recognition of bile duct injuries after laparoscopic cholecystectomy largely relies on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC). However, these invasive procedures are not without risk. Preliminary experience with use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to identify these injuries is reported. Methods: The medical records of five patients who had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy and had suspected major bile duct injuries were reviewed. All five patients underwent MRCP, followed by conventional cholangiography: either ERCP or PTC, or both. The findings of MRCP and conventional cholangiogaphy were compared. Results: Four patients had proven bile duct injuries. The remaining patient had gallstones dislodged into the common bile duct (CBD) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which presented as transient jaundice mimicking a bile duct injury. The MRCP images were of higher diagnostic value than conventional cholangiographic images in four patients with frank bile duct injury. For these patients, ERCP showed only the cut-off sign of the CBD, and PTC was needed to visualize the upper biliary system. MRCP, however, demonstrated the entire biliary system proximal and distal to the amputated or stenotic sites simultaneously. In the remaining patient with dislodged gallstones, the two techniques yielded similar diagnostic information. Conclusion: This preliminary study suggests that MRCP is an ideal diagnostic test whenever bile duct injury following laparoscopic cholecystectomy is suspected.

0034022662	Contrast-enhanced dynamic computed tomography does not aggravate the clinical severity of patients with severe acute pancreatitis: Reevaluation of the effect of intravenous contrast medium on the severity of acute pancreatitis	Background: Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) is useful in demonstrating pancreatitis necrosis, but the administration of contrast medium in animal models with acute pancreatitis may worsen the severity. Hypothesis: The use of contrast-enhanced CT in clinical patients with acute pancreatitis may actually aggravate the severity of the disease. Design: A randomized prospective study. Selling: Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. Patients: Twenty patients with severe acute pancreatitis were randomly divided into 2 groups. Those in group A (n = 10) underwent a CT examination with a contrast-enhanced medium, and those in group B (n = 10) underwent a CT examination without a contrast-enhanced medium. Main Outcome Measures: The patients' serum amylase, lipase, C- reactive protein, leukocyte, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, creatinine, calcium, and phosphate levels were serially checked before the CT examination and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after the examination was performed. The biochemical data between the 2 groups were compared. The morbidity, length of stay, and mortality were also compared. Results: There were no significant changes in the level of pancreatic enzymes, C-reactive proteins, and leukocytes and in the biochemical data of either group before or after the CT examination. The difference in the previously examined values between the 2 groups was also not significant. There was also no difference in the morbidity, length of hospital stay, and mortality between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT does not aggravate the severity of clinical patients with severe acute pancreatitis.

0034048697	Impact of concomitant hepatolithiasis on patients with peripheral cholangiocarcinoma	The association of hepatolithiasis (HL) and peripheral cholangiocarcinoma (PCC) has been well recognized. However, information concerning the impact of hepatolithiasis on patients with peripheral cholangiocarcinoma is sparse and therefore difficult to assess. A total of 162 consecutive patients with histologically proven peripheral cholangiocarcinoma were treated surgically at Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital between 1977 and 1994. Among them, 106 patients (65.4%) had associated hepatolithiasis (PCC + HL group), and the remaining 56 patients (34.6%) did not (the PCC - HL group). The differences in demographics, symptomatology, laboratory data, tumor staging, histological pattern, resectability rates, and long-term survival of these two groups were compared. The male to female ratio was 0.7 in the PCC + HL group and 1.3 in the PCC - HL group (P < 0.05). Two thirds of the PCC + HL group presented with acute cholangitis, whereas two thirds of the PCC - HL group presented with hepatomegaly (P < 0.01). Those patients in the PCC + HL group were in earlier stages than those of the PCC - HL group at the time of the initial diagnosis (P < 0.05). The resectability rate for the PCC + HL group was 31.1% and for the PCC - HL group, 26.8% (P > 0.05). Surgical mortality rates were 3.8% in the PCC + HL group and 3.6% in the PCC - HL group (P > 0.05). The morbidity rate was much higher in the PCC + HL group than in the PCC - HL group (P < 0.01). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 35.5%, 20.5%, and 16.5% in the PCC + HL group and 27.2%, 8.8%, and 7.8% in the PCC HL group (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the presence of hepatolithiasis hindered an exact diagnosis of underlying cholangiocarcinoma preoperatively, precipitated biliary sepsis which affected resectability, and increased postoperative morbidity. Hepatolithiasis per se, however, did not influence the long-term survival.

0033765810	Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas: Case report	Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas is a rare pancreatic tumor, and it occurs most in young females and adolescents. Generally it behaves either as a benign or low grade malignant neoplasm and its nature indicates a favorable prognosis. We present a rare advanced case. A 20-year-old woman initially presented with progressive jaundice, anorexia, poor intake, and post-prandial vomiting two weeks prior to admission. Two ill-defined masses were palpable over the left upper abdomen and right iliac fossa on physical examination. Anemia and jaundice were also noted. Abdominal computed tomography showed multiple masses at the Douglas pouch, supra-urinary bladder, mesentery, omentum and lesser sac. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography demonstrated termination at the common hepatic duct and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography revealed abrupt disruption of the pancreatic duct at the pancreatic head. Laparoscopy was performed and two masses of 1cm in size were sent for pathologic examination. Histopathologic examination showed proliferation of solid sheets of monotonous cells arranged in a pseudopapillary pattern. The tumor was identified as a solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas. The patient was treated with chemotherapy but the tumor mass enlarged progressively, which was identified in the follow-up abdominal computed tomography. She started to take chinese herb for treatment and was regularly followed up at our clinics for nealy one year. Rare cases present with advanced disease initially as in our patient. It is important to recognize such an unusual presentation may occur in patients with solid and papillary epithelial neoplasms of the pancreas.

0033769553	Early use of cyclic TPN prevents further deterioration of liver functions for the TPN patients with impaired liver function	Background/Aims: Impaired liver function is frequently found in patients who need prolonged total parenteral nutrition. Cyclic total parenteral nutrition can minimize the adverse effects of long-term total parenteral nutrition, such as hepatic complication. The adequate timing to shift to use cyclic total parenteral nutrition for patients with impaired liver function may prevent further hepatic dysfunction. Methodology: A prospective study of 65 patients who need total parenteral nutrition and have impaired liver functions was performed. Cyclic total parenteral nutrition was used in different groups of patients, when their total bilirubin levels were just over 5mg%, 10mg%, or 20mg% during the course of total parenteral nutrition. The patients of control groups received straight non-cyclic total parenteral nutrition. All the patients had stable vital signs without major stress, such as sepsis or acute bleeding. Ten patients (A2) in Group A were shifted to cyclic total parenteral nutrition when their total bilirubin was just over 5mg%; the other 10 patients (A1) continued the non-cyclic total parenteral nutrition. Eleven patients (B2) in Group B were shifted to cyclic total parenteral nutrition when their total bilirubin was just over 10mg%; the other 11 patients (B1) continued the non-cyclic total parenteral nutrition. Ten patients (C2) in Group C were shifted to cyclic total parenteral nutrition when their total bilirubin was just over 20mg%; the other 13 patients (C1) continued the non-cyclic total parenteral nutrition. The average energy intake among 3 groups had no difference. Their liver functions were examined each week for 2 weeks. Results: The results showed that the patients with non-cyclic total parenteral nutrition had significant increase of direct-total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (P<0.05) in Group A and significant decrease of albumin accompanied with increase of GOT, GPT, direct/total bilirubin (P<0.05) in Group B. The patients either using cyclic or non-cyclic total parenteral nutrition showed significant decrease of albumin and increase of direct/total bilirubin (P<0.05) in Group C. Conclusions: We conclude that the early use of cyclic total parenteral nutrition may prevent deterioration of liver function for the patients with jaundice and need prolonged total parenteral nutrition.

0033808429	Prospective and randomized study of gabexate mesilate for the treatment of severe acute pancreatitis with organ dysfunction	Background/Aims: Exaggerated production of various proteases may account for the late presence of organ dysfunction in acute pancreatitis. This study examined the effects of early administration of gabexate mesilate on the condition of patients with severe acute pancreatitis and organ dysfunctions. Methodology: Fifty-two patients with acute pancreatitis and organ dysfunction were enrolled. The treatment group included 26 patients receiving intravenous gabexate mesilate infusion at a dose of 100mg/hr for 7 days. APACHE-II score, clinical and biochemical parameters were monitored intensively. Results: Coagulopathy ileus, and abdominal pain was significantly improved with gabexate mesilate. Gabexate mesilate reduced the necessity for surgical intervention and peritoneal lavage. The 7-day-mortality and 90-day-mortality rates were also significantly reduced with gabexate mesilate therapy. Conclusions: There are strong indications from this study that early intravenous gabexate mesilate infusion results in improved survival in acute pancreatitis with organ dysfunctions.

0033983001	Malignant perihilar biliary obstruction: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatographic findings	OBJECTIVE: We studied the efficacy of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in the evaluation of malignant perihilar biliary obstructions, with reference to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). METHODS: A total of 40 patients with malignant perihilar biliary obstructions, who underwent both MRCP (Magnetom Vision; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany; projection technique and multislice plus maximum intensity projection) and ERCP examinations, were studied. The study group included hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor) in 26 patients, icteric hepatocellular carcinoma in four patients, gallbladder carcinoma in five patients, and metastasis from other than hepatobiliary origin in five patients. Axial and coronal magnetic resonance (MR) images were added simultaneously to the MRCP. The mean serum bilirubin level on admission was 11.5 mg/ml (range, 2.8-28.5 mg/ml). The presence and extent of malignant biliary obstruction were determined with both MRCP and ERCP following the known criteria: an abrupt and irregular character of a distal narrow segment, a proportionally dilated biliary tree proximally, and an irregularly shaped intraluminal filling defect. The efficacy of the MRCP examination in detecting the presence of biliary obstruction, its anatomical extent, and the underlying cause, respectively, was compared to that of ERCP. RESULTS: MRCP examination was successfully performed on all patients, whereas ERCP examination was unsuccessful in two patients. Both MRCP and ERCP were very effective in detecting the presence of biliary obstructions (40 of 40 vs 38 of 38, p = 1.0). MRCP was superior in its investigation of anatomical extent (34 of 40 vs 24 of 38, p = 0.015) and the cause of the jaundice (31 of 40 vs 22 of 38, p = 0.023) compared to ERCP. Specifically, the performance of MRCP is promising for the interpretation of cholangiocarcinoma (22 of 26) and gallbladder carcinoma (five of five), but is relatively ineffective for the interpretation of icteric HCC (two of four) and metastasis (two of five). CONCLUSION: MRCP represented an ideal noninvasive diagnostic tool for the evaluation of malignant perihilar biliary obstructions with reference to ERCP. (C) 2000 by Am. Coll. of Gastroenterology.

39049192241	Differential expression of claudin-4 between intestinal and diffuse-type gastric cancer	Our previous microarray analysis of gastric cancer found that claudin-4 was differentially expressed between intestinal-type gastric cancer (IGC) and diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC). Claudin-4 is a member of a large family of transmembrane proteins, claudins, essential in the formation and maintenance of tight junctions. To explore the roles of claudin-4 in the two histologically distinct types of gastric cancer, we selected 45 IGC and 48 DGC cases and then analyzed the expression of the protein using immunohistochemistry. We found that the overexpression of claudin-4 was greater in IGC than in DGC. A trend was observed between the overexpression of claudin-4 and lymph node metastasis, however, this association was not statistically significant. The results showed that the expression of claudin-4 was lower in DGC. Possibly it played a role in determining the diffuse phenotype and loose cohesion of cells in DGC in a similar manner as E-cadherin.

40349102023	Expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 in gastric cancer and their relation to claudin-4 expression	Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) MMP-2 and MMP-9 can degrade type IV collagen of extracellular matrix and basal membranes. Claudin-4 is a member of a large family of transmembrane proteins, claudins, essential in the formation and maintenance of tight junctions. Claudin-4 has been shown to activate MMP-2, indicating that claudin-mediated increased cancer cell invasion might be mediated through the activation of MMP proteins. To explore the roles of MMP-2, MMP-9 and claudin-4 in gastric cancer, we selected 88 cases and then analyzed the expression of these proteins using immunohistochemistry. We found that all of MMP-2, MMP-9 and claudin-4 expressions were significantly higher in intestinal-type than in diffuse-type gastric cancer. On further analysis, testing the relationship between MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression with claudin-4 expression, claudin-4 expression was significantly associated with MMP-9 expression, but not with MMP-2 expression. The results showed that MMP-2, MMP-9 and claudin-4 expression may be phenotypic features, distinguishing intestinal-type and diffuse-type gastric cancer. Possibly, claudin-4 played a role in determining MMP-9 activity which favored intestinal-type gastric cancer to distal metastasis.

4043091931	Hepatic resection of the intraductal papillary type of peripheral cholangiocarcinoma	Background: Peripheral cholangiocarcinoma (PCC) can be grossly classified into mass-forming, periductal-infiltrating, and intraductal papillary (IP) types. Information on IP-PCC patients undergoing hepatectomy is sparse because of the small number of cases. Methods: The clinical features of 40 IP-PCC patients undergoing hepatectomy between 1977 and 2000 were reviewed. The clinical features of 94 PCC patients without IP growth undergoing hepatectomy were used for comparison. Results: IP-PCC and non-IP-PCC groups had similar age distributions (P = .674), sex ratios (P = .079), and positive rates for serum carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19-9 (P = .121 and .795, respectively). The two groups also exhibited similar rates of association between hepatolithiasis and PCC (P = .230). However, more IP-PCC patients exhibited signs during admission, and more had ALT values >36 IU/L; they also had smaller tumors, more mucobilia association, and tumors in earlier stages and had undergone more postoperative chemotherapy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only ALT >36 IU/L differentiated IP-PCC from non-IP-PCC patients. The two groups exhibited similar operative mortality (P = 1.0). Follow-up ranged from 1.6 to 125.2 months (mean and median, 44.6 and 5.7 months, respectively). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 72.9%, 41.2%, and 24.7%, respectively, in the IP-PCC group and 43.3, 6.03%, and 2.01% in the non-IP-PCC group. The prognosis was favorable for the IP-PCC patients (P < .00001), particularly for IP-PCC patients who received curative hepatectomy (P = .013). Conclusions: IP-PCC patients had significantly better survival than non-IP-PCC patients, and aggressive curative hepatic resection is associated with a longer survival. © 2004 The Society of Surgical Oncology, Inc.

33644878537	Identification of differential gene expression between intestinal and diffuse gastric cancer using cDNA microarray	To compare the gene expression profiling between intestinal-type gastric cancer (IGC) and diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC), cDNA microarray containing 7334 gene elements was performed on 12 paired IGC specimens/its' normal epithelial tissue and 11 paired DGC specimens/its' normal epithelial tissue. Twenty-seven genes were co-over-expressed in IGC and DGC. These overexpressed genes were related to transcription and translation, DNA replications and mitosis, calcium binding, apoptosis and mitochondria protein. Twelve genes were co-underexpressed in IGC and DGC. These underexpressed genes were associated with cell adhesion and migration, organelle movement and intracellular transport, and matrix metalloproteinase. A clustering dendrogram of IGC and DGC with 27 genes significantly differed between IGC and DGC. Nineteen genes were more overexpressed in DGC than in IGC, including annexin A1 (ANXA1), chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7), and chemokine ligand 8 (CCL8). Eight genes were more overexpressed in IGC than in DGC, including claudin 4 (CLDN4). The results of quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining confirmed the microarray finding. The gene expression profiling between IGC and DGC suggested that they might have unique genetic pathways which share some of the same and some different genetic alterations.

33644890162	Combined resection and multi-agent adjuvant chemotherapy for desmoplastic small round cell tumor arising in the abdominal cavity: Report of a case	Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare, highly aggressive malignancy with distinctive histological features: a nesting pattern of cellular growth within dense desmoplastic stroma, occurring in young population with male predominance. The mean survival period is only about 1.5-2.5 years. The tumor has co-expressed epithelial, muscle, and neural markers in immunohistochemical studies. This work reports a 27-year-old man presenting with hematemesis and chronic constipation. Serial studies including endoscopy, upper gastrointestinal series, abdominal computed tomography and barium enema study showed disseminated involvement of visceral organs. The patient underwent aggressive surgery and received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin. He survived without any disease for 20 mo after the surgery. No standard treatment protocol has been established. Aggressive surgery combined with postoperative multi-agent adjuvant chemotherapy is justified not only to relieve symptoms but also to try to improve the outcome in this advanced DSRCT young patient. © 2006 The WJG Press.

33645680173	Overexpression and elevated serum levels of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a common malignancy with a very low 5-year survival rate. Currently, there are no valid markers for early detection and targets for therapy. Here, we used 2-DE to analyze the protein profiles of eight PDAC specimens and paired adjacent nontumor tissues. MS was used to identify 15 protein spots that were found to be overexpressed in PDAC tissues versus adjacent controls. One of them was identified as phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) 1, a secretable glycolytic enzyme known to participate in angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis of 63 PDAC specimens revealed moderate to strong expression of PGK1 in >70% of the tumors. Further Western blotting analysis of cells from tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues obtained by laser capture microdissection confirmed the enhanced expression of PGK1 in tumor cells. Furthermore, the serum levels of PGK1 were significantly higher in PDAC patients (n = 21) than in the control group (n = 25) (p < 0.005), as determined by ELISA. These observations indicate that protein profile analysis using a combination of 2-DE and MS provides an effective strategy for identifying biomarkers that may have diagnostic potential for PDAC, and identify PGK1 as a potential biomarker and/or therapeutic target for PDAC. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

34248571420	Timing of mortality in severe acute pancreatitis: Experience from 643 patients	Aim: To determine the timing of mortality after onset of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and the course of the disease in a large series of patients. Methods: From July 1996 to June 2005, all patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan were retrospectively studied. Three thousand two hundred and fifty episodes of acute pancreatitis were recorded in 2248 patients (1431 males and 817 females; median age, 55.6 years; range, 18-97 years). Mortality was divided into two groups: early death (≤ 14 d after admission), and late death (> 14 d after admission). The clinical features of patients in these two groups were compared. Results: Although the overall mortality rate of acute pancreatitis was 3.8% (123/3250), mortality rate of SAP was as high as 16.3% (105/643). Of those 105 SAP mortalities, 44 (41.9%) deaths occurred within the first 14 d after admission and 61 (58.1%) occurred after14 d. Incidence of early death did not significantly differ from that of late death. The co-morbidities did not contribute to the timing of death. Early deaths mainly resulted from multiple organ failure. Late deaths were mainly caused by secondary complication of infected necrosis. Intra-abdominal bleeding significantly caused higher mortality in late death. Conclusion: Approximately half (42%) of SAP deaths occur within 14 d and most were due to multiple organ failure. The late deaths of SAP were mostly due to infected necrosis. © 2007 The WJG Press.

34250174589	Kinase mutations and imatinib mesylate response for 64 Taiwanese with advanced GIST: Preliminary experience from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital	Purpose: Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) express constitutively activated mutation of kit or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), which are therapeutic targets for imatinib. Results of 64 Taiwanese with advanced GIST treated with imatinib were reported. Method and materials: Between 2001 and May 2006, a prospective, non-randomized, and a single center trial containing 64 Taiwanese patients with advanced GIST treated with imatinib was conducted. Each tumor was investigated for mutations of kit or PDGFRA. Results: The median follow-up time after imatinib administration was 16.1 months. 12 patients (18.8%) had complete response (CR), 24 (37.5%) had a partial response (PR), 12 stationary disease (18.8%), 16 progressive disease (25.0%). The 64 Taiwanese with advanced GIST had an estimated median survival of 48.0 months and 4-year survival rate for 76.1%. Kit mutation was found in 49 of 54 (90.7%) test patients and five of them had no mutation (9.3%). No PDGFRA mutant was identified. In 40 patients harboring kit exon 11 mutations, the CR and PR rates (ORR) were 57.5% , nine patients with tumors containing kit exon 9 mutation had ORR rates of 22.2%, and five patients with no mutation had ORR rates of 60.0% (not significant; P = 0.149). Conclusions: Activated mutation of kit constituted 90.7% genetic alteration of Taiwanese with advanced GIST and no PDGFRA mutation was detected. Imatinib induced a sustained objective response in more than half of Taiwan advanced GIST patients. ORR did not differ between patients whose GISTs had no mutation, kit exon 9, and 11 mutations.

60549112395	Evaluation of differentially expressed genes by shear stress in human osteoarthritic chondrocytes in vitro	Background: The pathogenesis of osteoarthritis is related to abnormal mechanical stresses that alter cartilage metabolism and chondrocyte survival. Among the mechanical stresses, shear stress is held responsible for the development of arthritis. Methods: Monolayer cultures of human osteoarthritic chondrocytes were subjected to fluid-induced shear stress in vitro. A cDNA microarray technology was used to screen the differentially regulated genes and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) was used to confirm the results. The significance of the expression ratio for each gene was determined on the lowest associated false discovery rate calculated from the changes of gene expression in relation to the standard deviation of repeated measurements for that gene. Results: Exposure of human osteoarthritic chondrocytes to shear stress (0.82 Pa) for 2 hours differentially regulated 373 and 227 clones in two independent microarray analyses with at least a 1.7-fold change. By comparing the differentially regulated clones, 14 upregulated and 6 downregulated genes were identified. Many of the differentially expressed genes were related to cell proliferation/differentiation (TGF-β, acidic FGF), cell survival/apoptosis (CYP1B1, BCL2L3, TNFRSF11B, chemokine ligands, ADM), and matrix homeostasis (DCN, SDC2, MGP, WISP2). Conclusion: The gene expression patterns following shear stress show a high similarity to the gene expression in the reparative process of osteoarthritis chondrocytes. Using microarray analysis, this study suggests a close interaction between shear stress and the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.

0034868342	Parenteral nutrition support after bone marrow transplantation: Comparison of total and partial parenteral nutrition during the early posttransplantation period	OBJECTIVE: Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) usually is indicated if the patient's malignant disease involves the marrow or if hazard to the normal marrow is the limiting factor in the aggressive treatment of disease. The success of BMT depends on a complete team with all the resources needed to ensure optimal results. Aggressive nutrition support after BMT is very important. Adequate parenteral nutrition, total (TPN) or partial, followed by enteral nutrition according to the patient's gastrointestinal function is the important principle. METHODS: Between 1996 and 2000, 60 patients, 46 male and 14 female, received BMT in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Their ages ranged from 6 to 54 y. Standard TPN was used in 40 patients after BMT, and partial parenteral nutrition was used in the remaining 20 patients. TPN was enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) when the patient's liver functions were impaired, and cyclic TPN was shifted when the patient's liver functions persistently deteriorated. RESULTS: Most patients improved their nutrition status and increased their body weights, especially those receiving TPN. The patients receiving partial parenteral nutrition decreased their visceral proteins significantly during the course of parenteral nutrition. The BCAA-TPN can maintain a patient's visceral protein better than standard TPN. Only two patients expired because of graft rejection and sepsis; their body weights and nutrition status showed deterioration despite aggressive nutrition support. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the nutrition support for patients with BMT is related to the success of marrow transplantation. Parenteral nutrition support, especially with TPN, is important because of frequent gastrointestinal dysfunction during the posttransplantational period, and it is better at maintaining the nutrition status and body weights of patients after BMT. An oral diet can be resumed after the patient's gastrointestinal function has improved and it can be tolerated. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

77954686414	Expression of thymidylate synthase determines the response of gastric cancer patients undergoing gastrectomy to 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy	Purpose We investigated whether the intensity of thymidylate synthase (TS) staining in tissue samples obtained from gastric cancer (GC) patients undergoing gastrectomy could predict response to 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy after gastrectomy. Method and materials Clinicopathological features of 124 patients with histologically proven GC who underwent radical gastrectomy were retrospectively reviewed. Tissue samples obtained from these patients were immunohistochemically stained for assessing TS expression. We arbitrarily classified the TS staining results as low (<20% cytoplasmic immunostaining) and high (=20% cytoplasmic immunostaining) TS expression. Results The clinicopathological features of the low TS expression group patients were typically similar to those of the high TS expression group patients. However, multivariate forward stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that low TS expression was independently associated with females and responders to 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. The median follow-up duration for the 124 GC patients who had undergone curative resection was 41.3 months. The GC patients who showed poor tumor differentiation and high TS expression had short disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Conclusions Low TS expression is significantly associated with female GC patients and responders to 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. It predicts longer DFS and OS in selected GC patients treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection. The results suggest that prospective assessment of TS staining intensity in tissue samples obtained from GC patients undergoing gastrectomy would be useful to predict the patients who would be benefited from 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy after gastrectomy. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

84877818719	Clinicopathologic study of node-negative advanced gastric cancer and analysis of factors predicting its recurrence and prognosis	Background: This study aimed to reveal the predictors for the recurrence pattern of gastric cancer (GC) and analyze the prognostic factors in node-negative advanced (T2 to T4) GC after curative resection. Methods: Between 1994 and 2006, 448 patients with node-negative advanced GC undergoing radical resection were enrolled in this study. Clinicopathologic factors affecting the recurrence pattern and prognosis for GC were analyzed. Results: Location, size, tumor invasion depth, and perineural invasion were associated with tumor recurrence and outcome. T4 status was a predictor for locoregional recurrence and peritoneal seeding, and a large tumor size and the presence of perineural invasion predicted hematogenous spread. Patients with only locoregional recurrence had better survival than those with peritoneal seeding or hematogenous spread. Conclusions: In node-negative advanced GC, the prognostic factor differed significantly between locoregional recurrence/peritoneal seeding and hematogenous metastasis. Survival rates were higher in patients with locoregional recurrence alone than in patients with other recurrence patterns. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84908158223	Prognosis of ductal adenocarcinoma of pancreatic head with overexpression of CD44	Background: The long-term survival rate of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is very low. Cancer stem cells have been identified in PDAC based on the expression of the surface markers CD24, CD44, CD133, and epithelial specific antigen. The prognosis of PDAC may be related to the presence or absence of tumor cells with cancer stem cell surface markers. Methods: Eighty-six PDAC patients (51 male and 35 female patients) who underwent surgical treatment at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Lin-Kou Medical Center, Lin-Kou, Taiwan between 1998 and 2007 were included in this study. The patients' ages ranged from 30 years to 84 years. All their surgical specimens showed invasive ductal cancer. Immunohistochemical staining with CD44 antibodies was performed.

44649182808	Sex differences in response to immunonutrition in sepsis	Background: Cell-mediated immune response is superior in females compared to males. Whether sex differences influenced mortality in sepsis while on immune-enhancing nutrients was investigated. Materials and Methods: Seventy-two non-orchitectomized male and non-oophorectomized female rats (n = 36/group) were randomized into four groups. Rats were fed either an immune-enhancing diet or control diet for five days. Sepsis was induced with caecal ligation and puncture (CLP). An additional group of orchitectomized and oophorectomized rats (n = 36/group) were divided into four groups; fed either an immune-enhancing or control diet of one month, then following castration. Sepsis was induced with CLP. The influence of immune-enhancing nutrients on the effect of the rat's sex on mortality rates and serum cytokines were compared. Results: Non-orchitectomized male rats had a decreased mortality (88.9% vs. 16.7%) on immune-enhancing diet. Low mortality among non-oophorectomized female rats persisted, on immune-enhancing diet (27.8% vs. 11.1%). Orchitectomized rats demonstrated reduced mortality (88.8% vs. 50%) on immune-enhancing diet. Oophorectomized rats showed a similar trend (55.6% vs. 44.4%). Orchitectomy increased mortality in spite of immune-enhancing diet (50% vs. 16.7%). Oophorectomy increased mortality on immune-enhancing diet (44.4% vs. 11.1%). Circulating IL-1β was higher in non-oophorectomized female rats on control diet compared to immune-enhancing diet. Non-orchitectomized male and non-oophorectomized female rats had similar increases in IL-10 on immune-enhancing diet. Conclusions: Mortality rates on immunonutrition were less in male than female rats following sepsis. Orchitectomy did not confer an advantage for septic rats. Sex hormone was more important than immunonutrition in septic female rats. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

44949215845	Candida parapsilosis peritonitis complicated with infected pancreatic pseudocysts in a peritoneal dialysis patient: A challenge for nephrologists	In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)-related cases of fungal peritonitis, Candida parapsilosis (C. parapsilosis) has become as common as Candida albicans (C. albicans) in fungal isolates. This report describes a 74-year-old male CAPD patient who received bypass surgery for coronary artery disease, followed by an episode of bacterial peritonitis. The peritonitis was successfully treated with intraperitoneal antibiotics. However, C. parapsilosis peritonitis with concomitant pancreatitis and infected pseudocysts occurred one month later. Despite surgical drainage and intravenous administration of fluconazole, fungal peritonitis persisted. Finally, he died of nosocomial pneumonia. This case demonstrates the poor outcome of C. parapsilosis peritonitis, suggesting a more aggressive treatment in peritoneal dialysis patients. ©2008 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K. Feistle.

47149085795	Portomesenteric venous gas in acute bowel ischemia: Report of a case	Portomesenteric venous gas and pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) are rare but important radiographic findings. They are usually discussed separately in the literature and little is known about the clinical importance of their combination in acute bowel ischemia. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) has proven useful for detecting subtle portomesenteric venous gas or PI in the early stages of acute bowel ischemia. Although the CT findings of either portomesenteric venous gas or PI as separate entities are not pathognomonic of bowel infarction, CT evidence of the combination of both these disorders is strongly associated with transmural bowel infarction, especially band-like pneumatosis. We report a case of portomesenteric venous gas combined with band-like pneumatosis, diagnosed based on CT evidence of both findings. We performed an emergency laparotomy for suspected acute bowel ischemia, which was confirmed by the operative findings. © 2008 Springer.

50049135408	Physician-scientist: Attitude of graduates of clinical medicine graduate schools	Background/Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate and analyze the motivation, results and influential factors of the research work of graduates from clinical medicine graduate institutes in Taiwan. Methods: There were 679 graduates from 1978 to 2004; all of them completed residency training following medical school before entering graduate study. A survey with 56 questions in four sections was sent to them and 268 (40%) responded. We used SPSS 11.0 for our statistical analysis and cross analysis. Results: There were 239 (89.2%) males, and 29 (10.8%) females. One hundred and forty-seven (54.9%) respondents had PhD degrees and 98 had Master's degrees (36.5%) while 23 had both degrees (8.6%). The majority of respondents recognized the importance of clinical research (73.5%), while 25.8% thought that physicians do not necessarily have to do research. After graduation from medical school, 54.1% of respondents indicated that clinical care, teaching, and research were prioritized in that order. The graduate school did emphasize the importance of research, but as clinicians, clinical care was still the priority in their careers. A majority of the graduates thought that the graduate school helped to a significant degree in their research. Motivation was important in 83.2% to go to graduate school. The time spent in research ranged from 1 to 4 days a week, and the time spent each research day ranged from 1 to 6 hours. The majority of the researchers thought that they lacked independent research space. For research quantity and quality, physicians with a PhD had more projects than those with Master's degrees in general, with 60.4% participating in laboratory research and 61% in clinical research. Some type of mechanism to reward research activities was present in 69.2% of the institutions or hospitals. The biggest hindrance to medical research was the lack of time for research. The most productive age for publishing was between 41 and 55 years. Conclusion: The physician-scientist has a unique ability to bridge the gap between bench/laboratory and bedside. In a changing socioeconomic climate as well as cultural evolution in medical practice, external pressures are unavoidable. The support of research from institutions or government is very important, as are financial resources, space and equipment. For those physicians who are going into research, a special training of strict methodology in research will obviously become necessary. ©2008 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

52649083226	Clinicopathologic features and outcomes following surgery for pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma	Background: Pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) is a rare pancreatic malignancy subtype. We investigated the clinicopathological features and outcome of pancreatic ASC patients after surgery. Methods: The medical records of 12 patients with pancreatic ASC undergoing surgical treatment (1993 to 2006) were retrospectively reviewed. Survival data of patients with stage IIB pancreatic adenocarcinoma and ASC undergoing surgical resection were compared. Results: Symptoms included abdominal pain (91.7%), body weight loss (83.3%), anorexia (41.7%) and jaundice (25.0%). Tumors were located at pancreatic head in 5 (41.7%) patients, tail in 5 (41.7%), and body in 4 (33.3%). Median tumor size was 6.3 cm. Surgical resection was performed on 7 patients, bypass surgery on 3, and exploratory laparotomy with biopsy on 2. No surgical mortality was identified. Seven (58.3%) and 11 (91.7%) patients died within 6 and 12 months of operation, respectively. Median survival of 12 patients was 4.41 months. Seven patients receiving surgical resection had median survival of 6.51 months. Patients with stage IIB pancreatic ASC had shorter median survival compared to those with adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: Aggressive surgical management does not appear effective in treating pancreatic ASC patients. Strategies involving non-surgical treatment such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or target agents should be tested. © 2008 Hsu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

52649160646	Resveratrol attenuates hepatic injury after trauma-hemorrhage via estrogen receptor-related pathway	Resveratrol administration after adverse circulatory conditions is known to be protective, however, the mechanism by which resveratrol produces the salutary effects remains unknown. Recently, it was shown that resveratrol activates estrogen receptor (ER) in endothelial cells. We hypothesized that resveratrol administration in males after trauma-hemorrhage decreases cytokine production and protects against hepatic injury through an ER-dependent pathway. To study this, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to trauma-hemorrhage (mean blood pressure, 40 mmHg for 90 min) then resuscitation. A single dose of resveratrol (30 mg/kg of body weight) with or without an ER antagonist (ICI 182,780), ICI 182,780, or vehicle was administered i.v. during resuscitation. Tissue myeloperoxidase activity (a marker of neutrophil sequestration), cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1 (CINC-1), CINC-3, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels in the liver and plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase concentrations were measured at 2 and 24 h postresuscitation (n = 6 rats per group). One-way ANOVA and Tukey test were used for statistical analysis. Results showed that trauma-hemorrhage increased hepatic myeloperoxidase activity, CINC-1, CINC-3, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and IL-6 levels and plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase concentrations. These parameters were significantly improved in the resveratrol-treated rats at both 2 and 24 h postresuscitation. Coadministration of the ER antagonist IC1182,780 prevented the beneficial effects of resveratrol administration on postresuscitation proinflammatory responses and hepatic injury. Thus, resveratrol administration after trauma-hemorrhage attenuated hepatic injury, likely through reduction of proinflammatory mediators. Resveratrol-mediated hepatic preservation seemed to progress via an ER-related pathway. Copyright © 2008 by the Shock Society.

53549127804	The role of parenteral glutamine supplement for surgical patient perioperatively: Result of a single center, prospective and controlled study	Background: We conducted a prospective and case-controlled study to evaluate the impact of supplement of alanyl-glutamine dipeptide (Gln) in parenteral nutrition on perioperative immune and nutritional changes and clinical outcomes for patients undergoing gastrointestinal (GI) operations. Materials and methods: During 2006, 70 patients undergoing GI surgeries were allocated equally into two groups. One group received regular parenteral nutrition and the other received the same formulation and supplemented with the Gln; the two groups were isonitrogenous. The infusion was started from 1 day before operation to the sixth day after operation for 7 days. Blood samples were collected on the morning of the day before the operation and on the morning 6 days after the operation and analyzed for immune and nutrition parameters. Results: There were no differences between the two groups in terms of clinical characteristics, operative procedures, biochemistry, nutritional status, and immune status preoperatively. After GI surgery, significant reduction in nutritional and immune parameters were observed in both groups, demonstrated by significant difference of albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocyte count, T cell, and CD8 cell. The length of hospital stay is slightly longer in the control group patients, but not to statistical significance (16.3±21.3 versus 12.2±6.8 days, p=0.299). In terms of morbidity, there was no difference between the two groups, but two patients in the control group had wound infection; none was noted in the Gln group (p=1.0). No surgical mortality was noted in this study. Conclusions: Perioperative parenteral nutrition supplemented with Gln is beneficial for patients undergoing GI surgery. Gln supplementation significantly attenuated postoperative inflammation and ameliorated postoperative immunodepression as well as nutritional depression in GI surgery. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

55749113672	Clinicopathologic features and predictors for survival of mucinous and nonmucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma	Background/Aims: We report a study in patients with mucinous and nonmucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma treated surgically whose records were examined to elucidate their clinicopathologic features and prognostic factors for survival. Methods: The medical records of 34 patients with mucinous and nonmucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma (1991-2005) were retrospectively reviewed. Results: There was no significant difference between mucinous and nonmucinous tumors in patient demographics, clinicopathologic features, type of operation and outcome. Nonmucinous tumors had a higher incidence of leukocytosis than mucinous ones. The overall 5-year survival rate for 34 patients with appendiceal adenocarcinoma was 35.8%. In the univariate analysis, predictors of survival were the type of operation, resectability, carcinomatosis and tumor stage. Tumor stage significantly influenced patient survival in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma had clinicopathologic characteristics and a prognosis similar to nonmucinous, except that there was more leukocytosis in nonmucinous tumors. Tumor stage is an independent predictor for survival among patients with appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.

63749131143	Multifocal intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas-A case report	Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are relatively rare, comprising 10 percent of pancreatic cysts and only 1 percent of pancreatic cancers. Cystic neoplasms include mucinous cystic neoplasms, serous cystadenomas, papillary cystic tumors, cystic islet cell tumors and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (IPMNs). IPMN was first described in 1982. It has been most commonly described in 60 to 70 years old males, and represents a relatively "new" but increasingly recognized disease. The improvement and widespread use of modern imaging equipments and heightened awareness of physicians contribute to the increasing incidence of IPMN. The majority of IPMNs are located in the pancreatic head (75%) while the rest involves the body/tail regions. Multifocal IPMNs have been hypothesized, but the true presence of multifocality is unknown. Here we present a 72-yearold male diagnosed with IPMN (carcinoma in situ) in the pancreatic head and a branch duct type IPMN (duct atypia) in the pancreatic body and tail. The patient underwent a Whipple intervention and a distal pancreatectomy. A three-year disease-free survival has been observed so far. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng. All rights reserved.

67651244871	Surgical management of gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma	Aim: To study the behavior as well as optimal treatment of gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma, we reviewed the results of treatment of gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Methods: From 1987 to 2005, six patients were diagnosed with gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma and treated at our institution. Tumor staging was based on 2002 revised tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging for gall bladder cancer from the American Joint Committee on Cancer. The clinical presentation, laboratory data and preoperative workup were reviewed retrospectively. Results: Five patients were female and one was male. The age ranged from 51 to 66 years (median, 58 years). Surgical procedures included three curative resections, two palliative resections and one biopsy. There were two surgical complications (33.3%) and one case of surgical mortality (16.7%). The follow-up time ranged from 30 d to 5 mo. The median survival was 2.5 mo. The prognosis was extremely poor, even after curative resection and postoperative chemotherapy. Conclusion: The prognosis of gallbladder sarcomatoid carcinoma was not dependent on TNM stage and was always dismal. The clinicopathological features were different from those of gall bladder cancer. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng. All rights reserved.

70349561407	Prognostic analysis of patients with pancreatic head adenocarcinoma less than 2 cm undergoing resection	AIM: To investigate the differences in clinicopathological features between patients with pancreatic cancer greater or less than 2 cm situated over the pancreatic head and the prognostic factors for survival of patients with pancreatic cancer < 2 cm over the pancreatic head. METHODS: From 1983 to 2006, 159 patients with histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) at the pancreatic head undergoing curative resection at the Department of Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan were reviewed, comprising 123 cases of large (L)-PAC (tumor > 2 cm) and 36 cases of small (S)-PAC (tumor ≤ 2 cm). We compared the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of L-PAC and S-PAC patients. The clinicopathological characteristics of S-PAC were investigated to clarify the prognosis predictive factors of S-PAC. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-nine PAC patients, aged 16-93 years (median, 59.0 years) with a tumor at the pancreatic head undergoing intentional curative resection were investigated. The S-PAC and L-PAC patients had similar demographic data, clinical features, and tumor markers (a similar positive rate of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9). There were also similar rates of lymph node metastasis, portal vein invasion, stage distribution, tumor differentiation, positive resection margin, surgical morbidity and mortality observed between the two groups. During a follow-up period ranging from 1.0 to 122.7 mo (median, 10.9 mo), S-PAC and L-PAC patients had a similar prognosis after resection ( P = 0.4805). Among the S-PAC patients group, patients with higher albumin level (> 3.5 g/dL) had more favorable survival than those with lower albumin levels, which was the only favorable predictive prognostic factor. Meanwhile, early-staged (stage I, II) S-PAC patients tended to have a more favorable outcome than late-stage (stage III, IV) S-PAC patients, but this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: S-PAC patients should not be regarded as early PAC. Only higher albumin level (> 3.5 g/dL) and early stage disease (stage I, II) were the favorable prognosis factors for S-PAC patients. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng. All rights reserved.

7044264809	Efficacy of Gabexate mesilate on disseminated intravascular coagulation as a complication of infection developing after abdominal surgery	Background and Purpose: Gabexate mesilate (GM) is a promising anticoagulation treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This study was designed to examine the effect of GM on DIC associated with the development of infection after abdominal surgery in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: From January 1999 to March 2002, 50 consecutive ICU patients suffering DIC associated with the development of infection after abdominal surgery were enrolled in this study. Twenty five of the patients were randomized to receive treatment with GM by central intravenous infusion at 1 mg/kg/hour for 5 days or longer, while the remaining 25 were not treated. Blood clotting tests were performed and cytokine levels including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were examined on days 1,3, and 7 after admission. General blood tests and D-dimer tests were conducted before and after GM administration. The gender, age, mortality, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II) scores and severity of DIC were compared between the 2 groups. Results: No significant difference was found between the 2 groups in TNF-α and IL-6 concentration on days 1, 3, and 7. The mortality rate was similar between the 2 groups. However, DIC and APACHE-II scores were significantly lower in the GM-treated patients than in controls. Conclusion: In this study, GM (1 mg/kg/hour) (did not reduce the concentration of TNF-α and IL-6, or alter the mortality rate in patients with DIC resulting from infectious complications after surgery. Nevertheless, APACHE-II scores indicated that GM reduced the DIC severity and improved the clinical condition of patients.

0035102115	Surgery for chronic obstructive pancreatitis: Comparison of end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy with pancreaticoduodenectomy	Background/Aims: Chronic obstructive pancreatitis usually manifests with intractable pain and recurrent episodes of chronic pancreatic inflammation. The side-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy is used for those patients with a large pancreatic duct. But for the patients with small pancreatic duct, the optimal surgical procedure needs to be evaluated. A prospective study was designed to compare the different results between distal pancreatectomy plus end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy. Methodology: The patients were chosen prospectively and randomly to undergo either a distal pancreatectomy plus end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy in the last 3 years. Eighteen patients with chronic obstructive pancreatitis were randomly divided into two groups. Ten patients (group A) underwent distal pancreatectomy plus end-to-side and ductal to mucosal pancreaticojejunostomy, and the other 8 patients (group B) underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy were compared. Results: The operative time was significantly shorter and operative blood loss was less in group A. The postoperative follow-up of patients in group A had better outcome with increased body weight and no steatorrhea or diabetes mellitus, and all of them had complete pain relief. Conclusions: We concluded that distal pancreatectomy with end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy provided a better surgical treatment for the patients with chronic obstructive pancreatitis and small pancreatic duct.

73349095743	Clinical impact of positive surgical margin status on gastric cancer patients undergoing gastrectomy	Background. The clinical impact of positive surgical margin on the overall survival and recurrence pattern for gastric cancer (GC) patients undergoing intension curative resection has not yet been well investigated. Patients and methods. The clinical features of 1,565 patients with histologically proven GC who underwent intension curative resection from 1994 to 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 129 (8.2%) had positive microscopic resection margin. The clinicopathological features and the outcome of 1,436 GC patients undergoing gastrectomy with negative resection margin were used for comparison. Results. GC patients who underwent gastrectomy with higher T, N stage, and tumor size larger than 5 cm tended to have positive resection margin when compared with those with negative margin. Median follow-up duration for the 1,565 GC patients who underwent intension curative resection was 28.6 months. The overall survival (OS) rate significantly decreased when the patients had positive resection margin, irrespective of different stages. When GC patients underwent gastrectomy with positive resection margin, positive nodal metastasis determined the worst OS. Distant metastasis was the most common site of recurrence, followed by peritoneal and locoregional recurrence. Conclusions. Aggressive tumor biology might be the main factor contributing to positive microscopic resection margin after gastrectomy. Positive resection margin had a definite unfavorable impact on the OS of gastric cancer patients undergoing gastrectomy. When GC patients underwent gastrectomy with positive resection margin, positive nodal metastasis determined the worst OS, and distant metastasis was the most common site of recurrence. © 2009 Society of Surgical Oncology.

77649257405	Prognosis and feasibility of en-bloc vascular resection in stage II pancreatic adenocarcinoma	AIM: To establish the prognosis and feasibility of en-bloc vascular resection of stage II pancreatic adenocarcinoma of the head and uncinate process. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 87 patients with stage II pancreatic adenocarcinoma, who were subjected to pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and pylorus-preserving PD (PPPD) between 1996 and 2006 in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. Twelve and 75 patients underwent PD/PPPD with and without resection of portal vein/superior mesenteric vein (PV/SMV), respectively. RESULTS: The overall 1- and 3-year survival rates of patients undergoing PD/PPPD with and without vascular resection were 50.0% and 16.7%, and 44.4% and 12.2%, respectively. Morbidity and mortality rates in the PV/SMV resection vs non-resection group were 50.0% and 0.0%, and 40.0% and 2.7%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, serum bilirubin, histological differentiation and adjuvant chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors that influenced survival. CONCLUSION: In stage II adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head and uncinate process, serum bilirubin, histological differentiation and adjuvant chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors, and en-bloc vascular resection is a feasible option in carefully selected patients. © 2010 Baishideng.

77950688165	Isolated pancreatic metastasis from rectal cancer: A case report and review of literature	Isolated pancreatic metastases from a non-pancreatic primary malignancy are very rare. Studies have shown that resection of metastases is of proven benefit in some types of tumors. We report a case of 76-year-old Taiwanese woman with rectal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and abdominoperineal resection 2 years ago presenting with an asymptomatic mass at the pancreatic tail on a routine follow up abdominal computed tomography scan. The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy under the preoperative impression of a primary pancreatic malignancy. Histological examination of the surgical specimen showed metastatic adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis from rectal adenocarcinoma. Postoperative chemotherapy in the form of oral capecitabine was given. The patient is alive and disease free 12 months after the surgery. In a patient presenting with a pancreatic mass with history of a non-pancreatic malignancy, a differential diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis should be considered. Surgical resection of a solitary pancreatic mass is justified not only to get the definitive diagnosis but also to improve the survival. © 2010 Lee et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77950262000	Resveratrol prevents endothelial dysfunction and aortic superoxide production after trauma hemorrhage through estrogen receptor-dependent hemeoxygenase-1 pathway	Objective: To determine whether resveratrol provides vasculoprotection in trauma-hemorrhaged animals and whether the effects are mediated via estrogen receptor-dependent hemeoxygenase-1. Design: Prospective, multiexperimental, randomized, controlled studies. Setting: University research laboratory. Subjects: Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300-350 g. Interventions: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent trauma hemorrhage (mean arterial pressure 40 mm Hg for 90 min, then resuscitation). Resveratrol (30 mg/kg) with or without an estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182,780), a hemeoxygenase enzyme inhibitor (chromium-mesoporphyrin), or vehicle was injected during resuscitation. At 24 hrs after trauma hemorrhage with resuscitation or sham operation, the animals were euthanized for further evaluation. Measurements and Main Results: Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation decreased, whereas nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-stimulated superoxide radical production in the aorta and aortic p22phox, p47phox, gp91phox, NOX1, and NOX4 mRNA concentrations increased in trauma-hemorrhaged rats vs. sham rats. All altered parameters were normalized in resveratrol-treated trauma-hemorrhaged rats. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in hemeoxygenase-1 after trauma hemorrhage, and resveratrol treatment further increased hemeoxygenase-1 expression in trauma-hemorrhaged rats. However, administration of ICI 182,780 or chromium-mesoporphyrin abolished the resveratrol-induced prevention of shock-induced oxidative stress and endothelial damage. In the resveratrol-treated rats subjected to trauma hemorrhage, there were significant improvements in plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, and mortality rate, and there was lesser damage in histology. Conclusions: Resveratrol treatment prevented the overproduction of superoxide radical/NADPH oxidase expression and restored the trauma-hemorrhage-impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation via estrogen receptor-dependent stimulation of hemeoxygenase-1 expression. © 2010 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

77955215420	Claudin-4 expression is associated with tumor invasion, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in gastric cancer	Claudin-4 is a member of the claudin family, a large family of transmembrane proteins that are essential in the formation and maintenance of tight junctions. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 degrade type IV collagen of the extracellular matrix and basal membranes. Claudin-4 activates MMP-2, indicating that claudin-mediated increased cancer cell invasion may result from the activation of MMPproteins. In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to examine the expression levels of claudin-4, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in 189 gastric cancer samples, and analyzed their correlation with tumor invasion, clinicopathologic parameters and clinical outcome. The relationship between claudin-4 expression and MMP-2 and -9 expression was also investigated. The expression of claudin-4 was found to be significantly higher in gastric cancer cases with advanced depth of wall invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion and higher TNMstage. Further analysis revealed claudin-4 expression to be significantly correlated with the expression of MMP-2 and-9. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that MMP-9 expression was correlated with poor prognosis. These results suggest that claudin-4 expression is associated with tumor invasion and with MMP-2 and -9 expression in gastric cancer. Additionally, MMP-9 expression was demonstrated to serve as a prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer.

77955945637	Proteomic analysis of post-hemorrhagic shock mesenteric lymph	Recent studies have documented the association of mesenteric lymphatic route with adult respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure after hemorrhagic shock. However, the mediators and mechanisms of the toxic effects of mesenteric lymph remain unclear. This study aimed to identify mediators or biomarkers in the mesenteric lymph through comparative proteomic analysis. Fourteen mature male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided and subjected to trauma (laparotomy) plus hemorrhagic shock or trauma plus sham shock. Mesenteric lymph samples were collected before shock and at 3 h after resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock (or sham shock). To investigate changes in proteome profiles between preshock and 3-h postshock (or 3-h post-sham shock) mesenteric lymph samples, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were performed. We found a more than 2-fold change in abundance of 31 protein spots in the lymph samples. Mass spectrometry analyses identified 12 distinct proteins. Four proteins were consistently upregulated in the 3-h postshock lymph samples, including serum albumin precursor, two isoforms of cytoplasmic actin, complement C3 precursor, and major urinary protein precursor. Two proteins, including haptoglobin and one unidentified protein, were consistently downregulated. The deregulation of these proteins was confirmed by Western blots. Most of these altered proteins are functionally implicated in tissue inflammation. The findings of this study provide a starting point for investigating the functions of these proteins in hemorrhagic shock-induced lung injury and hold great promise for the development of potential therapeutic interventions. © 2010 by the Shock Society.

78349295591	Surgical management in metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients after imatinib mesylate treatment	Purpose Imatinib mesylate (IM) demonstrates substantial efficacy in most patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). However, progression of GIST eventually develops and emerges as a challenge. To assess the role of surgery in the multidisciplinary management of GISTs, we studied the surgical outcomes in GIST patients receiving IM. Materials and Methods Between 2001 and May 2009, 161 metastatic GIST patients received IM. Among them, 35 patients undergoing 38 surgeries were investigated. Patients were categorized based on extent of disease before surgery (responsive or stable disease (PR, SD), local progression (LP), and generalized progression (GP)). Each tumor was investigated for genetic alteration before and after surgery. Results Disease status before surgery was significantly associated with surgical result. Gross tumor clearance was achieved in 42.9% of patients with responsive disease, but only 4.8% of those with focal resistance and 0% of those with disease progression (P = 0.022). GIST patients with PR, SD, and LP had significant better 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival than those with GP. Secondary mutations tended to be found more frequently in GIST patients with LP after surgery than those with response (10/21 (47.6%) vs. 2/14 (14.3%); P = 0.07), indicating that surgery may prevent potential development of secondary mutation in GIST patients with response. Secondary kit mutations were also found more frequently with primary exon 11 mutation than those with exon 9 mutation (38.7% vs. 16.7%; P = 0.394). Conclusions Surgery may benefit selected GIST patients with PR, SD, and LP, especially for patients with LP because patients with LP had comparable survival to that of patients with responsive lesion. Surgery may prevent potential development of secondary mutations in selected patients with response after IM treatment. Secondary kit mutation was found more frequently in GIST patients with a primary kit exon 11 mutation than those with a primary kit exon 9 mutation. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

79956201597	Aggressive surgical approach for patients with T4 gastric carcinoma: Promise or myth?	Background: Surgical outcomes of multiorgan resection (MOR) for T4 gastric carcinoma reported in the literature are widely variable. We herein report a large surgical series of T4 gastric carcinoma. Methods: One hundred seventy-nine patients with cT4 gastric carcinoma were recruited onto the study. Patient characteristics, surgical strategy and related complications, long-term survival, and prognostic factors of T4 gastric carcinoma were analyzed. Results: Of 179 cT4 gastric carcinoma, there were 57 cT4 (pT3) with MOR, 91 pT4 with MOR, and 31 cT4 without MOR. pT4 with MOR were more likely to be associated with nodal metastasis, cellular dedifferentiation, and lymphoperineural infiltration compared to those of pT0-3 (P < 0.01 for all). For 91 pT4 with MOR, their surgical mortality and morbidity rates were 4.4 and 28.6%, respectively; their 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 55.2, 22.4, and 12.2%, respectively. The long-term survival of cT4 (pT3) with MOR was superior to pT4 with MOR (P = 0.006) and cT4 without MOR (P = 0.004). There was a striking difference between pT4 with MOR, R0 and pT4 with MOR, and R1 or R2 (P = 0.007). By means of multivariate analysis, lymph node status, liver invasion, and positive surgical margin were independent prognostic factors. Conclusions: Aggressive surgical management of pT4 gastric carcinoma should be limited to patients without adverse prognostic factors such as advanced nodal involvement and pancreatic invasion. © 2011 Society of Surgical Oncology.

79956297356	Secretome-based identification of ULBP2 as a novel serum marker for pancreatic cancer detection	Background: To discover novel markers for improving the efficacy of pancreatic cancer (PC) diagnosis, the secretome of two PC cell lines (BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2) was profiled. UL16 binding protein 2 (ULBP2), one of the proteins identified in the PC cell secretome, was selected for evaluation as a biomarker for PC detection because its mRNA level was also found to be significantly elevated in PC tissues. Methods: ULBP2 expression in PC tissues from 67 patients was studied by immunohistochemistry. ULBP2 serum levels in 154 PC patients and 142 healthy controls were measured by bead-based immunoassay, and the efficacy of serum ULBP2 for PC detection was compared with the widely used serological PC marker carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9). Results: Immunohistochemical analyses revealed an elevated expression of ULPB2 in PC tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Meanwhile, the serum levels of ULBP2 among all PC patients (n = 154) and in early-stage cancer patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (p<0.0001). The combination of ULBP2 and CA 19-9 outperformed each marker alone in distinguishing PC patients from healthy individuals. Importantly, an analysis of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves showed that ULBP2 was superior to CA 19-9 in discriminating patients with early-stage PC from healthy controls. Conclusions: Collectively, our results indicate that ULBP2 may represent a novel and useful serum biomarker for pancreatic cancer primary screening. © 2011 Chang et al.

0036498858	Prediction of supraclavicular lymph node metastasis in breast carcinoma	Purpose: Supraclavicular lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients has a poor prognosis, and aggressive local treatment has usually resulted in severe morbidity. The purpose of this study was to select high-risk neck metastasis patients for prophylactic radiotherapy. Methods: Between 1990 and 1998, 2658 consecutive invasive breast cancer patients underwent surgery and adjuvant therapy in the hospital. The median age was 47 years (range 22-92). The median follow-up period was 39 months. The following factors were analyzed: age, tumor size, tumor location, histologic type, histologic grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, DNA flow cytometry study results, number of positive axillary lymph nodes, use of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy, and level of involved axillary nodes. Results: Of the 2658 patients, 113 (4.3%) developed supraclavicular lymph node metastasis during this period. Young age (≤40 years), tumor size >3 cm, high histologic grade, angiolymphatic invasion, negative estrogen receptor status, synthetic phase fraction >4%, >4 positive nodes, and level II or III involved nodes were all significant for predicting neck metastasis in the univariate analysis. Three predictive factors were significant after multivariate analysis: high histologic grade, >4 positive nodes, and axillary level II or III involved nodes. In patients with axillary level I involved nodes and ≤4 positive nodes, the incidence was 4.4%. If axillary level III was involved, the rate of supraclavicular lymph node metastasis was 15.1%. Conclusion: The incidence of supraclavicular lymph node metastasis was higher in the groups with >4 positive nodes and in those with axillary level II or III involved nodes. Selective use of comprehensive radiotherapy for these high-risk patients will achieve good locoregional control. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

79958050049	Akt pathway is required for oestrogen-mediated attenuation of lung injury in a rodent model of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis	Background: The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) is known to be an endogenous negative feedback or compensatory mechanism that serves to limit pro-inflammatory and chemotactic events in response to injury. The aim of this study is to elucidate whether Akt plays any role in 17β-estradiol (E2)-mediated attenuation of lung injury after acute pancreatitis (AP). Materials and methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent cerulein-induced AP. Rats were treated with vehicle (cyclodextrin), E2 (1 mg/kg body weight [BW]), or E2 plus PI3K/Akt inhibitor Wortmannin (100 μg/kg BW) 1 h after the onset of AP. At 8 h after sham operation or AP, various parameters were measured. Results: AP led to a significant decrease in lung Akt phosphorylation, which was associated with increased lung tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, wet-to-dry weight ratios, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC)-1, and CINC-3 levels. Administration of E2 after AP restored the AP-induced decrease in Akt phosphorylation and attenuated the increase in lung injury markers (MPO activity and wet-to dry weight ratios) and pro-inflammatory mediator production. The effects of E2 on the lung were abolished by co-administration of Wortmannin. Conclusions: These results collectively suggest evidences that the Akt pathway seems to be required for E2-mediated protection of lung injury after AP.

79959753120	Early signet ring cell gastric cancer	Background: Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRC) is defined as a histological entity. The clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of gastric SRC remain controversial. Methods: From 1994 to 2006, 2,439 patients with gastric carcinoma who underwent gastrectomy were enrolled. Of these, 505 patients (20.7%) had SRC and were compared to 1,934 patients with other histological types. Results: Twenty-nine percent of patients in the SRC group (n = 149) had early gastric cancer, with tumor invasion limited to the mucosa or submucosa, compared to 22.2% of patients in the non-SRC group (n = 430). The proportion of regional LN metastases was 10.7 and 16.0% in early SRC and early non-SRC, respectively, (p = 0.115). The 5-year survival rates for patients with early SRC were better than those for patients with early non-SRC (96.1 vs. 89.6%, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Early gastric SRC has favorable prognosis. There is no significant difference in terms of LN metastasis between SRC histologic type and other histological types. Less-invasive strategies may be acceptable in selected patients with early gastric SRC. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84855171710	Impact of HER-2 overexpression/amplification on the prognosis of gastric cancer patients undergoing resection: A single-center study of 1,036 patients	Background. Opinions regarding the impact of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 overexpression or HER-2 amplification on the prognosis of gastric cancer patients are mixed. The present study attempted to clarify this issue by investigating a large cohort of surgical patients. Methods. We investigated 1,036 gastric cancer patients undergoing curative-intent resection. Their surgical specimens were evaluated for HER-2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and those with HER-2 expression levels of 2+ were additionally subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Data on demographic and clinicopathological features and relevant prognostic factors in these patients were analyzed. Results. HER-2 positivity was noted in 64 (6.1%) of 1,036 gastric cancer patients, including 46 patients whose HER-2 expression level was 3+ on IHC and 18 patients whose FISH results were positive. On univariate analysis, HER-2 positivity was more often associated with differentiated histology, intestinal type, and negative resection margins, whereas only differentiated histology was independently associated with HER-2 positivity in a logistic regression model. For stage I-IV gastric cancer, HER-2 was not a prognostic factor. In a subpopulation study, although HER-2 positivity emerged as a favorable prognostic factor for stage III-IV gastric cancer on univariate analysis, it failed to be an independent prognostic factor after multivariate adjustment. Conclusions. The prevalence of HER-2 positivity, determined using standardized assays and scoring criteria in a large cohort of gastric cancer patients after resection, was 6.1%. HER-2 positivity was phenotypically associated with differentiated histology. HER-2 is not an independent prognostic factor for gastric cancer. © AlphaMed Press.

84856302225	Clinicopathological features and prognostic factors of gastric cancer patients aged 40 years or younger	Background and Objectives Gastric adenocarcinoma (GC) occurs frequently in the sixth decade of life and is uncommon in patients aged 40 years or younger. The aims of this study were to define the clinicopathological features and elucidate the prognostic factors of GC in the young. Methods Between 1998 and 2006, 1,815 GC patients undergoing resection were enrolled in a prospective database. The findings for 115 (6.0%) patients aged 40 years or younger were compared with those of 1,009 patients between 56 and 75 years old. Results The group of young patients with GC included significantly more women than the group of old patients (60.0% vs. 37.0%, respectively); young patients also had more T4 lesions (73.9% vs. 61.6%), undifferentiated tumors (85.2% vs. 55.1%), severe desmoplasia (41.4% vs. 12.2%), Lauren's diffuse-type cancers (55.6% vs. 27.7%), and perineural invasion (69.1% vs. 46.1%). Survival rates in younger patients at 3, 5, and 10 years after resection were 56.8%, 52.0%, and 42.1%, respectively, similar to those in older patients (P=0.411). Unfavorable independent prognostic factors of GC in the young were degree of nodal involvement (N3 vs. N0; P=0.001), advanced T status (T3-4 vs. T1-2; P=0.015), tumor size (>4 vs. P0.019), and status of resection margins (positive vs. negative; P0.044). Conclusions GC tends to exhibit more aggressive tumor behavior in young patients than in old patients; however, the surgical survival of young and old patients was similar. Advanced nodal involvement (N3) is the most important independent prognostic factor in the young. © 2011 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84858969674	Gender different response to immunonutrition in liver cirrhosis with sepsis in rats	Females with sepsis have a better prognosis than males, while those of both genders with cirrhosis have a high mortality. Impaired immunity accompanies liver cirrhosis. The potential association between sex and immunologic response of cirrhotic rats in sepsis following immunonutrition was investigated. One hundred and forty-three rats were randomly divided into groups. Liver cirrhosis was produced by weekly feeding of CCl4 for 8 weeks. Among them, 24 male and 19 female underwent castration one month before studying. The rats were fed with either immune enhancing diet or control diet for five days, then sepsis was induced with cecalligation and two holes puncture. Main outcomes included mortality and serum cytokines (IL-1β, 6, and 10). Comparisons were made both within and between genders. Cirrhotic non-castrated male rats showed a significant decrease in mortality (64.1% vs. 32.1%, p = 0.032) with better survival than control diet following immune enhancing diet. Lower mortality of cirrhotic non-castrated female rats was found after immune enhancing diet (69.6% vs. 52.1%, p = 0.365). Cirrhotic castrated male rats showed a lower mortality (44.4%) following immune enhancing diet, and cirrhotic castrated female rats also showed significantly lower mortality and better survival than control diet after immune enhancing diet (87.5% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.004). Plasma concentrations of IL-1β were higher in non- oophorectomized female rats fed with control diet compared to immune enhancing diet. Non-orchidectomized males and non-oophorectomized females exhibited similar increases in IL-10 after immune enhancing diet. Our results demonstrated that immunonutrition was more beneficial for male than female cirrhotic rats following sepsis. Though orchidectomy was not found to be more advantageous for the normal male rats in sepsis, immunonutrition seemed to be as important as sex hormone for female rats in sepsis. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84860530929	Clinicodemographic aspect of resectable pancreatic cancer and prognostic factors for resectable cancer	Background: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PCA) is one of the most lethal human malignancies, and radical surgery remains the cornerstone of treatment. After resection, the overall 5-year survival rate is only 10% to 29%. At the time of presentation, however, about 40% of patients generally have distant metastases and another 40% are usually diagnosed with locally advanced cancers. The remaining 20% of patients are indicated for surgery on the basis of the results of preoperative imaging studies; however, about half of these patients are found to be unsuitable for resection during surgical exploration. In the current study, we aimed to determine the clinicopathological characteristics that predict the resectability of PCA and to conduct a prognostic analysis of PCA after resection to identify favorable survival factors.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical files of 688 patients (422 men and 266 women) who had undergone surgery for histopathologically proven PCA in the Department of Surgery at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan from 1981 to 2006. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients who underwent resection and patients who did not undergo resection in order to identify the predictive factors for successful resectability of PCA, and we conducted prognostic analysis for PCA after resection.Results: A carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) level of 37 U/ml or greater and a tumor size of 3 cm or more independently predicted resectability of PCA. In terms of survival after resection, PCA patients with better nutritional status (measured as having an albumin level greater than 3.5 g/dl), radical resection, early tumor stage and better-differentiated tumors were associated with favorable survival.Conclusions: Besides traditional imaging studies, preoperative CA 19-9 levels and tumor size can also be used to determine the resectability of PCA. Better nutritional status, curative resection, early tumor stage and well-differentiated tumors predict the favorable prognosis of PCA patients after resection. © 2012 Chiang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84862811309	Standard Radical Gastrectomy in Octogenarians and Nonagenarians with Gastric Cancer: Are Short-Term Surgical Results and Long-Term Survival Substantial?	Background: The high incidence of gastric cancer among the octogenarians and nonagenarians (oldest old; age ≥80 years) is emerging as an important management issue. Herein, we report both the short-term outcomes and long-term survival results of standard radical gastrectomy in this group of patients. Methods: This was a retrospective review of 164 oldest old patients (older group) and 2,258 younger patients (age <80 years; younger group) with gastric cancer who underwent curative resection between January 1994 and December 2006. Clinicopathologic data, long-term survival, and prognostic factors were analyzed. Results: Clinical tumor stage did not differ between the two groups at the time of diagnosis. Higher Charlson comorbidity index scores (≥5) were observed in the older group than in the younger group; this was associated with higher postoperative morbidity (P = 0. 035) and in-hospital mortality rates (P = 0. 015) in the older group. At a median follow-up of 37. 8 months, the overall survival rate for the older group was lower than that for the younger group (P < 0. 001). However, the cumulative incidence of gastric cancer-related deaths was comparable between the two groups. Nodal involvement and metastatic to retrieved lymph node ratio were the only independent predictors of survival in the older group. Conclusions: Patients in the older group had a higher postoperative morbidity rate but comparable cancer-specific survival. Careful patient selection for gastrectomy is warranted in elderly patients, particularly those with high-grade nodal involvement. © 2012 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.

84862772941	Chromogranin a is a reliable biomarker for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in an Asian population of patients	Purpose: To evaluate the significance of plasma chromogranin A (CgA) levels in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET) in terms of disease status and treatment responses. Materials and Methods: Forty-four GEP-NET patients comprising 15 disease-free patients and 29 patients with active disease, as well as 26 healthy participants were enrolled in this study between April 2010 and April 2011. Clinicopathological factors were collected and serial plasma CgA levels were measured. Results: Plasma CgA levels were significantly higher in GEP-NET patients with active disease than in disease-free patients (p = 0.011) or healthy participants (p = 0.001). No difference in CgA levels was observed in terms of primary tumor location, tumor grade, and functional status in patients with active disease. CgA values at 94 U/l distinguished healthy individuals or disease-free patients from patients with active disease. Sensitivity and specificity rates were 86 and 88%, respectively. CgA levels at 110 U/l differentiated patients without recurrence from those with recurrence, with a sensitivity rate of 100% and a specificity rate of 80%. Patients (5/5, 100%) with stable disease and who showed partial response after treatment had a more than 20% decrease in CgA levels compared with the baseline values. Patients (6/6, 100%) with progressive disease showed a less than 20% decrease or increase in CgA levels. Conclusion: The plasma CgA level is a reliable biomarker for GEP-NET. We conclude that changes in CgA levels are associated with disease status and treatment responses. Copyright © 2012 S. Karger AG.

84863351245	CCL7 and CCL21 overexpression in gastric cancer is associated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis	AIM: To investigate how a complex network of CC chemokine ligands (CCLs) and their receptors influence the progression of tumor and metastasis. METHODS: In the present study, we used immunohisto-chemistry to examine the expression of CCL7, CCL8 and CCL21 in 194 gastric cancer samples and adjacent normal tissues. We analyzed their correlation with tumor metastasis, clinicopathologic parameters and clinical outcome. RESULTS: We found that the higher expression of CCL7 and CCL21 in cancer tissues than in normal tissues was significantly correlated with advanced depth of wall invasion, lymph node metastasis and higher tumor node metastasis stage. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that CCL7 and CCL21 overexpression in cancer tissues was correlated with poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that over-expression of these two CC chemokine ligands is associated with tumor metastasis and serves as a prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer. © 2012 Baishideng.

84864265191	Management of cirrhotic patients with blunt abdominal trauma: Analysis of risk factor of postoperative death with the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score	Introduction: The aim of this retrospective study is to analyse the risk factors of mortality in cirrhotic patients with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) underwent laparotomy and the value of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score to predict postoperative death is determined. Materials and methods: From July 1993 to June 2005, 34 cirrhotic patients with BAT were reviewed. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), frequency (percentage), or Pearson correlation coefficient. Predictors were compared by uni- and multiple logistic regression analysis and results were considered statistically significant if P < 0.05. The prognostic value of the MELD score in predicting postoperative death was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: Of the 34 patients (27 men, 7 women; mean age, 49 years), the Injury Severity Score (ISS) ranged from 4 to 43 (mean: 14). Of the 34 patients, 12 were treated with nonoperative management (NOM) initially and 4 succeeded and 30 patients (88.2%) eventually required laparotomy. Of the 30 operative patients, 7 died of haemorrhagic shock and the other 6 died of multiple organ failure with a 43.3% mortality rate. Of the 17 survivors after laparotomy, 4 developed intra-abdominal complication, and 3 developed extra-abdominal complication with a 41.2% morbidity rate. On univariate analysis, the significant predictors of surgical mortality were shock at emergency department, damage control laparotomy, ISS and MELD score. On multiple logistic regression analysis, the significant predictors of operative mortality were shock at ED (P = 0.021) and MELD score (P = 0.012). Analysis by ROC curve identified cirrhotic patients with a MELD score equal to or above 17 as the best cut-off value for predicting postoperative death. Conclusions: Liver cirrhosis with BAT has a high operative rate, low salvage rate of NOM, high surgical mortality and morbidity rate. The MELD score can accurately predict postoperative death and a MELD score equal to or above 17 of our data is at high risk of postoperative death. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0036990259	Benefits of palliative surgery for far-advanced gastric cancer	Background: The optimum strategy for palliative surgery in gastric cancer patients remains undetermined. Methods: In total, 525 patients who had undergone palliative surgery between 1994 and 2000 were evaluated in terms of operative mortality, survival, and palliative effect. Patients were grouped according to the UICC's classification of residual tumors (R) after the operation: microscopic residual tumor (R1) (N = 104) and macroscopic residual tumor (R2) (N = 421). Gastric resection was performed in all R1 patients and in 257 of the R2 patients. Non-resection procedures were performed in 164 of the R2 patients, including gastroje-junostomies in 64, gastrostomies in 17, jejunostomies in 60, and laparotomies only in 23. Results: The operative mortality did not significantly differ among R1 distal gastrectomies (4.5%), R2 distal gastrectomies (3.3%), and R1 total gastrectomies (2.9%) (p = 0.919). R2 total gastrectomies showed a particularly higher operative mortality (10.9%) than did the other resection procedures. The survival time and palliative duration were significantly longer in patients after palliative resection than after non-resection operations. Postoperative chemotherapy prolonged the survival time of patients after palliative surgery. Conclusion: R1 or R2 distal gastrectomies and R1 total gastrectomies have benefits of survival prolongation and symptomatic palliation. However, the use of a total gastrectomy in R2 patients must be selectively reserved for faradvanced cases, otherwise it should be replaced with less-invasive procedures to avoid a high operative mortality rate. Postoperative chemotherapy is useful for prolonging survival time.

0037266737	Hemodynamic and hepatic microcirculational changes in endotoxemic rats treated with different NOS inhibitors	Background/Aims: Severe septic shock may produce hypotension, which is due to the vasodilatational effect of nitric oxide. The effects of different nitric oxide synthase inhibitors on the hemodynamic and hepatic microcirculation of the endotoxemic rats were studied. Methodology: A prospective controlled study was performed. Eighteen Sprague-Dawley male rats (250-300g) were anesthetized and studied. The rats were divided into three groups. The rats in group A (n=6) were injected with lipopolysaccharide (50mg/kg BW) and L-NAME (5mg/kg BW). The rats in group B (n=6) were injected with the same dose of lipopolysaccharide and aminoguanidine (400μmole/kg BW). The rats in group C rats (n=6) were injected with same dose of hpopolysaccharide and normal saline as a control. The rats were cannulated with femoral arterial, venous, and jugular venous catheters. Cardiac output was measured using a thermodilutional method, and liver sinusoidal microcirculation was measured with Laser Doppler Flowmetry. The cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate, blood pressure, and microcirculational flux of the liver in the three groups were measured and compared at 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 minutes after injection. Results: The rats of group A showed significant decrease of their cardiac output, stroke volume and hepatic microcirculation after the drugs were infused though their blood pressure increased. The rats of group B showed decrease of their blood pressure and stroke volume initially, but no significant change of their cardiac output and hepatic microcirculation. At the 80th min, the rats of group B had the significantly highest cardiac output, stroke volume and hepatic microcirculation among three groups. Conclusions: The aminoguanidine prevents the hypotensive effect as well as L-NAME during severe sepsis, but it can maintain cardiac output, stroke volume and hepatic microcirculation better than L-NAME.

0037266771	The changes of hepatic sinusoidal microcirculation and effects of nitric oxide synthase inhibitor during sepsis	Background/Aims: Sepsis may cause changes in liver blood flow, which may result in liver injury. Microcirculation in organ undergoes moderate alteration during sepsis or septic shock. The changes in hepatic microcirculation corresponding to liver functions and the effects of nitric oxide synthase inhibitor on the liver during sepsis were studied. Methodology: Sepsis was produced by CLP (cecal ligation and two-hole puncture). In part I, the leukocyte adherence, leukocyte rolling numbers, and velocity of sinusoidal microcirculation of liver were compared with in vivo microscopy among early septic, late septic and control rats. In part II, the rats were randomly divided into two groups after CLP procedure, group A was given L-NAME (N

0036838840	Characterisation of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, trefoil factor 1, and epidermal growth factor and its receptor in pancreatic cystic neoplasms and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma	Background and aims: The pancreatic cystic neoplasms, including solid pseudopapillary tumour (SPT), mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), and intraductal papillary mucin producing tumour (IPMT), have their characteristic clinicopathological features. A systematic investigation of oestrogen receptor (OR), progesterone receptor (PR), trefoil factor 1 (TFF1), and epidermal growth factor and its receptor (EGF and EGFR) expressed in pancreatic cystic neoplasms and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was determined to elucidate their corresponding sex and age predilection, cell origin, and pathway of malignant transformation. Methods: Surgical specimens of SPT (n=10), MCN (n=12), IPMT (n=10), and ductal adenocarcinoma (n=20) were studied. The expression of OR, PR, TFF1, EGF, and EGFR were each determined in each disease entity using monoclonal antibodies by immunohistochemical method. The results were correlated with the clinicopathological data. Results: PR was expressed in all 10 SPT, whereas OR was expressed in none of 10 SPT. TFF1 was not or weakly expressed in SPT. Although EGF was strongly expressed in seven of 10 SPT, synchronous expression of EGF and its receptor was expressed in none of 10 SPT. Of the 12 MCN, six had PR expression in the stroma cells but not in the neoplastic epithelium, seven had a moderate or strong expression of TFF1, and 10 had no or weak EGFR expression, irrespective of their benigneity or malignancy. Synchronous expression of EGF and EGFR was observed in only one of 12 MCN. Among 10 IPMT, TFF1 and EGFR were moderately or strongly expressed in all six malignancies, whereas TFF1 and EGFR were not or weakly expressed in three of four benigneity. Of 20 ductal adenocarcinomas, TFF1 and EGFR were moderately or strongly expressed in 16 and 12, respectively. Synchronous expression of EGF and EGFR was observed in six of 10 IPMT and nine of 20 ductal adenocarcinoma, respectively. Conclusion: PR was uniquely expressed in SPT, and OR and PR were expressed in stroma of MCN, reflecting their sex and age predilection. TFF1 expression was related to EGFR such as in IPMT and ductal adenocarcinoma, not related to EGFR such as in MCN, and not related to hormonal receptors such as in SPT. EGF and its receptor might play a part in the malignant transformation of IPMT and ductal adenocarcinoma, but not of SPT and MCN.

0038447239	Duodenal Brunner's gland adenoma: Clinical analysis of eight cases	Background: Brunner's gland adenoma is an uncommon intestinal tumor, frequently located in the duodenal bulb. This investigation reports a series of patients with Brunner's adenoma treated at Chang Gang Memorial Hospital. Methods: The medical records of patients with Brunner's gland adenoma were reviewed. Their clinical characters, endoscopic features, radiological findings, management, and histological features were thoroughly investigated and discussed. Results: Totally, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were admitted to this study, with ages ranging between 24 and 60 years old. Patients presented with hemorrhage (n=4), obstruction (n=1), or incidental finding (n=1). Additionally, one patient had symptoms of hemorrhage concomitant with obstruction, and one patient suffered from long-term dull epigastralgia and epigastric fullness. Tumors were generally pedunculated and polypoid, located in the first portion of the duodenum, and ranged between 3 and 8 cm at their maximum dimension. These patients were managed with duodenotomy followed by polypectomy (n=3), endoscopic polypectomy (n=2), subtotal gastrectomy (n=2), and bypass with gastrojejunostomy (n=1). Histologically, Brunner's gland adenomas are composed of lobules of proliferating Brunner's glands separated by strands of smooth muscle fibers. The outcome of the patients reviewed herein was predominantly favorable, and no additional major morbidity was identified. Conclusion: Brunner's gland adenomas are uncommon duodenal tumors occurring in middle age. They present with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, obstructive symptoms, or incidentally. Panendoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography might be helpful in diagnosing Brunner's gland adenoma, and surgical and endoscopic excision is uncomplicated and favorable. Small or asymptomatic tumors can be managed by either expectant or endoscopic excision, while larger tumors causing symptoms can be treated surgically either through resection or alternative bypass.

84867744314	Melatonin prevents hemorrhagic shock-induced liver injury in rats through an Akt-dependent HO-1 pathway	Although melatonin treatment following trauma-hemorrhage or ischemic reperfusion prevents organs from dysfunction and injury, the precise mechanism remains unknown. This study tested whether melatonin prevents liver injury following trauma-hemorrhage involved the protein kinase B (Akt)-dependent heme oxygenase (HO)-1 pathway. After a 5-cm midline laparotomy, male rats underwent hemorrhagic shock (mean blood pressure approximately 40 mmHg for 90 min) followed by fluid resuscitation. At the onset of resuscitation, rats were treated with vehicle, melatonin (2 mg/kg), or melatonin plus phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin (1 mg/kg). At 2 hr after trauma-hemorrhage, the liver tissue myeloperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde, adenosine triphosphate, serum alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were significantly increased compared with sham-operated control. Trauma-hemorrhage resulted in a significant decrease in the Akt activation in comparison with the shams (relative density, 0.526 ± 0.031 versus 1.012 ± 0.066). Administration of melatonin following trauma-hemorrhage normalized liver Akt phosphorylation (0.993 ± 0.061), further increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation (5.263 ± 0.338 versus 2.556 ± 0.225) and HO-1 expression (5.285 ± 0.325 versus 2.546 ± 0.262), and reduced cleaved caspase-3 levels (2.155 ± 0.297 versus 5.166 ± 0.309). Coadministration of wortmannin abolished the melatonin-mediated attenuation of the shock-induced liver injury markers. Our results collectively suggest that melatonin prevents hemorrhagic shock-induced liver injury in rats through an Akt-dependent HO-1 pathway. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84868674477	Clinical practice guidelines for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor in Taiwan	For many years, the understanding of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), which are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, has been very limited. However, it is now possible to provide a more precise definition through the use of pathology classification and molecular techniques. Coupled with the advancement of clinical practice, especially the development of targeted therapy, there is now a much better insight into its treatment. At present, organizations such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network in the USA and the European Society for Medical Oncology in Europe have established a consensus and drawn up guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of GISTs.With experts coming from various districts in Taiwan and combining the most recent clinical data and experiences, the Taiwan Surgical Society of Gastroenterology drafted the first national GIST treatment guidelines after a consensus meeting in 2007. Following subsequent advances in GIST diagnosis and treatment, further revisions and modifications have been made to the original guidelines. We present here the updated consensus and recommendations of the Taiwan Surgical Society of Gastroenterology for the diagnosis and treatment of GIST. We hope these guidelines can help enhance the quality of diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with GIST in Taiwan. © 2012 Yeh et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84871686145	Expression of angiogenesis-related factors in human corneas after cultivated oral mucosal epithelial transplantation	PURPOSE. We analyzed the expression of angiogenesis-related factors in corneal tissues that had undergone previously autologous cultivated oral mucosal epithelial transplantation (COMET). METHODS. Six eyes from four chemically- and two thermallyinjured patients with limbal stem cell deficiency who received COMET to promote wound healing were studied retrospectively. Immunoconfocal microscopy was performed on corneal specimens from the patients after COMET, as well on normal corneas, conjunctiva, and oral mucosa for keratin 8, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), VEGF, collagen XVIII (endostatin), pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 3 (TIMP-3), thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). RESULTS. FGF-2, VEGF, endostatin, PEDF, and IL-1ra were detected in all the samples, with signals for FGF-2, VEGF, and IL-1ra localized to the full-thickness epithelial layer, as signals for endostatin limited to the basement membrane. Expression of PEDF varied in tissues, with a preferential expression in the suprabasal epithelial layer. FGF-2 and IL-1ra were abundantly expressed in the basal epithelial layer in specimens with increased stratification. Signals for sFlt-1, TIMP-3, and TSP-1 were detected in normal corneal epithelium, and in a specimen containing corneal epithelium, but were negative in all other specimens. CONCLUSIONS. Expression of FGF-2, VEGF, PEDF, endostatin, and IL-1ra was similar in normal corneas, conjunctiva, oral mucosa, and corneas after COMET. Expression of sFlt-1, TIMP-3, and TSP-1 was limited to normal corneas and negative for other tissues. A lack of the aforementioned antiangiogenic factors may contribute to the peripheral corneal neovascularization seen after COMET. © 2012 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

84873738245	Long-term results and prognostic factors in resected pancreatic body and tail adenocarcinomas	Background: Adenocarcinoma of the body and tail of the pancreas are more often than not inoperable to begin with. Factors predicting the prognosis in the resected tumors of pancreatic body and tail were analyzed. Methods: Between 1989 and 2006, 43 patients with adenocarcinoma of the body and tail of the pancreas underwent resection at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan. Univariate and multivariate analysis of clinicopathological factors affecting the prognosis were analyzed. Results: Totally, 32 patients were available for the analysis. The median follow-up was 13.6 months (1.5-87.5 months). The median survival time was 14.2 months and the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 58.1, 25.8, and 6.5 %, respectively. On univariate analysis, the factors which influenced the survival were tumor size >4 cm (p = 0.004), lymphatic invasion (p = 0.001), and positive resection margin (p = 0.030). On multivariate analysis, only the tumor size and the lymphatic invasion were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion: Even after macroscopic curative resection, the prognosis remains poor for pancreatic body and tail adenocarcinoma. Early diagnosis is the key to achieving long-term survival. Newer effective adjuvant treatment after curative resection is needed to improve the survival © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84875365236	Sex different responses and immunomodulation in severe sepsis	Different responses among the sexes have been reported following trauma and sepsis and have been reported in various articles, revealing that female patients had a better outcome than male patients. In addition, several animal and clinical studies have also demonstrated differences among the sexes in susceptibility to septic challenge. Sex steroids may contribute to the above differences regarding sexual dimorphism, and androgens have been found to have an immunosuppressive effect. Sexual dimorphism may be influenced by the effects of sex hormones and a different ratio of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in women than men. Enhanced immune response with an immune-enhancing diet for male rats was demonstrated to reduce their mortality in sepsis, which was less important for female rats unless their ovaries were removed. Immunonutrition was more beneficial for males than for females following sepsis, especially when combined with liver cirrhosis. © 2012.

84877693081	Role of Akt/HO-1 pathway in estrogen-mediated attenuation of trauma-hemorrhage-induced lung injury	Background: Despite advances in intensive care medicines, hemorrhagic shock leading to multiple organ failure remains the major causes of death in the injured host. Although studies have shown that 17β-estradiol (E2) prevents trauma-hemorrhage-induced lung damage, it remains unknown whether protein kinase B (Akt)/heme oxygenase (HO)-1 plays any role in E2-mediated lung protection after trauma-hemorrhage. Materials and methods: After a 5-cm midline laparotomy, male rats underwent hemorrhagic shock (mean blood pressure ∼40 mm Hg for 90 min) followed by fluid resuscitation. At the onset of resuscitation, rats were treated with vehicle, E2 (1 kg/mg), E2 plus phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (5 mg/kg), or LY294002. At 2 h after trauma-hemorrhage or sham operation, lung tissue myeloperoxidase activity, wet-to-dry-weight ratio, inflammatory mediators, and apoptosis were measured. Lung Akt, HO-1, and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels were also determined. Results: E2 attenuated the trauma-hemorrhage-induced increase in lung myeloperoxidase activity, edema formation, inflammatory mediator levels, and apoptosis, which was blocked by co-administration of LY294002. Administration of E2 normalized lung Akt phosphorylation and further increased HO-1 expression and decreased cleaved caspase-3 levels after trauma-hemorrhage. Co-administration of LY294002 prevented the E2-mediated attenuation of shock-induced lung injury. Conclusions: Our results collectively suggest that Akt-dependent HO-1 upregulation may play a critical role in E2-meditated lung protection after trauma-hemorrhage.

84881126219	Dual-incision laparoscopic surgery for peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation and fixation: A novel, simple, and safe procedure	Background: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an alternative modality to hemodialysis and is usually used to treat patients with end-stage renal disease. Dual-incision laparoscopic surgery (DILS) had been reported in several surgical fields; however, no report was proposed about DILS in PD catheter implantation (DILS-PD). In this study, we present DILS with a novel, simple, and safe procedure for PD catheter implantation with fixation and describe the long-term outcome. Subjects and Methods: We conducted a prospective data collection and retrospective review of all PD patients from April 2010 until June 2012. During this study period, we performed open surgery for PD catheter implantation (OS-PD) and DILS-PD concurrently. Demographic data, medical, operative, and postoperative findings, and information regarding complications were compared between these two groups. Results: Forty-eight patients had DILS-PD, and 70 patients had OS-PD. There was no difference between the two groups in age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, creatinine level, body mass index, and previous abdominal surgery. There was no surgical mortality in either group. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 24 months, with a mean of 22.4±16.5 months. There was no tube migration in the DILS-PD group, but 25.7% of the patients in the OS-PD group had tube migration (P<.001). A significantly decreased exit-site/tunnel infection rate was found in the DILS-PD group (4.2%) compared with the OS-PD group (17.1%) (P=.032). However, there was no obvious difference in peritonitis occurrence between groups. A significantly decreased catheter failure rate was found in the DILS-PD group (4.2%) compared with the OS-PD group (22.9%) (P=.006). DILS-PD group patients had a favorable survival rate for catheter implantation compared with OS-PD group patients. Conclusions: Our DILS-PD with fixation technique is a simple and safe procedure. This procedure minimized or even eliminated the possibility of migration without additional cost. Our DILS-PD fixatation technique should be recommended for use routinely. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.

84885423116	Prognostic significance of the number of examined lymph nodes in node-negative gastric adenocarcinoma	Aim In this study, we investigated the prognostic significance of the number of examined lymph nodes in node-negative gastric adenocarcinoma (GC). Patients and methods A total of 1194 node-positive and 1030 node-negative GC patients undergoing potentially curative gastrectomy was enrolled in this study. Patients were stratified into 3 groups according to the number of examined lymph nodes: group 1, ≤15; group 2, 16-25; group 3, >25. Results Patients with node-negative GC had significantly favorable survival compared with those with node-positive. Among patients with node-negative T2-T4 disease, the percentage of locoregional relapse was higher in those with <25 examined lymph nodes than in those with ≥25 examined lymph nodes. The number of examined lymph nodes affected the overall survival rates for patients with node-negative T2-T4 GC but not for patients with T1 lesions. Tumor size, tumor location, the number of examined lymph nodes, T status, and the presence of perineural invasion were significant prognostic factors as determined by multivariate analysis in node-negative GC. Conclusions No survival benefit of examining ≥15 lymph nodes was noted for patients with node-negative T1 GC. Extensive lymphadenectomy in patients with node-negative T2-T4 lesions in whom the number of examined lymph nodes was >25 had favorable survival. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0345392673	Pancreatoduodenectomy for Chronic Pancreatitis with an Inflammatory Mass of Pancreatic Head: Preoperative and Postoperative Functional Assessment	Background/Aims: In chronic pancreatitis patients with an inflammatory mass of the pancreatic head receiving pancreatoduodenectomy, postoperative quality of life, including nutritional status, has become important. Pre- and postoperative evaluation of pancreatic function is essential as an effective means of proper nutritional management of patients following pancreatoduodenectomy. Methodology: Fifteen patients with chronic pancreatitis and inflammatory mass of the pancreatic head who had received standard pancreatoduodenectomy were enrolled in this investigation. All patients had their biliary and pancreatic ducts reconstructed according to Child's arrangement. Furthermore, all patients had smooth postoperative courses and were assessed for the pancreatojejunostomy by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography at least a month after the initial operation. Exocrine pancreas functions were clinically assessed with various clinical items and two indirect pancreatic function tests: the fecal elastase test and the Bentiromide test. Endocrine pancreas functions were assessed using serum C-peptide level, HbA1 level and the need for hypoglycemic therapy. Results: The results indicated that the pancreatojejunostomies of all patients are patent magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. All patients benefited from the selected symptom relief and various clinical parameters, including medications, dietary restrictions, body mass index and plasma albumin levels, experiencing pain relief and improved exocrine and endocrine functions. Conclusions: Pancreatic function did not deteriorate after pancreatoduodenectomy for chronic pancreatitis with an inflammatory mass of pancreatic head, while quality of life was significantly improved.

84899703971	A novel role of the tumor size in pancreatic cancer as an ancillary factor for predicting resectability	Background: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PCA) is a devastating disease. Only surgery can provide effective treatment. The resectability of pancreatic cancer is mainly determined by image studies. However, half of the patients deemed as operable, radiologically, are found to be inoperable during surgery. Previously, we have showed that both CA 19-9 and tumor size could predict PCA resectability, independently. Here, we aimed to determine the cut-off value for tumor size permitting PCA resectability by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 372 patients undergoing surgery for histopathologically proven PCA. We compared tumor sizes of patients in resectable and unresectable groups and analyzed them by the ROC curve. Results: The tumor size in unresectable groups is significantly larger than that in the resectable group. The area under the ROC curve was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.665-0.789), which represented a good correlation between the tumor size and pancreatic cancer resectability. The PCA patients with a tumor diameter of > 4.8 cm had a 5.043-fold higher chance of unresectability than did those with a tumor diameter < 4.8 cm (odds ratio, 5.043; 95% CI, 3.221-7.894). Conclusions: A tumor diameter > 4.8 cm is a potential ancillary parameter for determining the resectability of PCA in addition to traditional image studies. Diagnosis laparoscopy may be indicated for radiologically resectable PCA patients with tumor size > 4.8 cm to prevent unnecessary laparotomy.

84902267495	Different gene preferences of maple syrup urine disease in the aboriginal tribes of Taiwan	Background Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex. Mutations in any one of the three different genes encoding for the BCKD components, namely, BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT, may be responsible for this disease. In Taiwan, few MSUD cases were diagnosed clinically, and most of these patients are from Aboriginal tribes. Materials and methods To identify and detect the carrier frequency of MSUD in Taiwanese Aboriginal tribes, we performed biochemical and molecular studies from peripheral blood in MSUD patients and dried blood on filter paper in the enrolled screened populations. Results Homozygous A208T and I281T of BCKDHA were found in two patients from Hans (non-Aboriginal Taiwanese), respectively; compound heterozygous mutations of the DBT gene [4.7 kb deletion/c.650-651insT (L217F or L217fsX223) and c.650-651insT/c.88-89delAT] were found in two patients from Amis, respectively, after direct DNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism studies. There were no cases of deleted 4.7-kb heterozygote out of 302 normal people (Hans, n = 125; Atayal, n = 156; and Saisiyat, n = 21); by contrast, the DBT mutations c.650-651insT and deleted 4.7-kb heterozygote were noted in 2/121 and 1/121, respectively, from the general population of the Amis, a southeastern Taiwanese tribe. Conclusion Although the Taiwanese Austronesian Aboriginal tribes are considered to share a common origin, different gene preferences of MSUD were noted. The novel DBT mutation c.650-651insT was more prevalent than the deleted 4.7-kb heterozygote in the Amis population. The reported 4.7-kb deletion indicating a possible founder mutation may be preserved in the southern and eastern, but not in northern Aboriginal tribes of Taiwan. © 2013, Taiwan Pediatric Association.

84901946326	Prognostic significance of splenectomy for patients with gastric adenocarcinoma undergoing total gastrectomy: A retrospective cohort study	Background: The addition of splenectomy to a D2 gastrectomy in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) has remained controversial. This study aimed to assess the impact of splenectomy on the overall survival of patients undergoing total gastrectomy for GA. Methods: This was a retrospective review of 463 GA patients (excluding positive resection margins and pathologic spleen invasion) undergoing curative total gastrectomy with (TS) and without splenectomy (T) between 1994 and 2008. Clinicopathologic factors affecting the prognosis of these patients were collected prospectively and analyzed. Results: Two hundred and ninety one patients had T and 172 patients underwent TS. Patient clinicopathological characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups except for tumor size. There were no significant differences in postoperative morbidity and mortality between T and TS groups. Patients in the T group had similar 3- and 5-year survival rates compared with those in the TS groups (p=0.181). The addition of splenectomy to a total gastrectomy did not impact on the overall survival rates in patients with GA in terms of depth of tumor invasion and nodal metastasis. Conclusions: The addition of splenectomy is not associated with survival advantage in GA patients undergoing total gastrectomy. © 2014 Surgical Associates Ltd.

84904248460	Claudin-4 expression in gastric cancer cells enhances the invasion and is associated with the increased level of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 expression	Claudin-4 is a member of a large family of transmembrane proteins known as claudins, which are essential for the formation and maintenance of tight junctions. Our previous studies have revealed that claudin-4 proteins are overexpressed in metastatic gastric cancer. To clarify the roles of claudin-4 in gastric cancer metastasis, human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells constitutively expressing wild-type claudin-4 were generated. Expression of claudin-4 in AGS cells was found to increase cell invasion and migration, as measured by Boyden invasion chamber assays. Moreover, the claudin-4-expressing AGS cells were found to have increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 expression, indicating that claudin-mediated increased invasion may be mediated through the activation of the MMP protein. Overall, the results suggest that claudin-4 overexpression may promote gastric cancer metastasis through the increased invasion of gastric cancer cells.

84917707214	Plasma chromogranin a levels predict survival and tumor response in patients with advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors	Aim: To correlate the baseline and change of chromogranin A (CgA) levels with patient survival and tumor response in Asian patients with advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Patients and Methods: Sixty patients with advanced GEP-NET treated in a medical center between April 2010 and April 2013 were enrolled retrospectively. Plasma CgA level was analyzed for correlation with the patient's clinical outcome and tumor response. Results: Multivariate analysis showed that independent favorable prognostic factors for overall survival were: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Groups performance score 0-1, World Health Organization tumor grade 1-2, single organ metastasis and less than twice the upper normal range of baseline CgA levels. Percentage changes in paired CgA tests (ΔCgA) of more than 17% can predict partial response or stable disease from progressive disease with 91.2% sensitivity and 82.9% specificity. Conclusion: Baseline plasma CgA levels predicted overall survival and ΔCgA predicted treatment response in Asian patients with GEP-NETs.

0642276586	Intraoperative Ultrasonographically Guided Excisional Biopsy or Vacuum-Assisted Core Needle Biopsy for Nonpalpable Breast Lesions	Objective: To compare duration and rates of underestimation and complete excision for nonpalpable breast lesions using either intraoperative ultrasonographically guided excisioned biopsy (IUGE) or directional vacuum-assisted biopsy (DVAB). Summary Background Data: Percutaneous ultrasonography-guided core needle biopsy is preferable to stereotactic biopsy for treatment of nonpalpable breast lesions; however, underestimation and false-negative results can occur., and rebiopsy may be required. To date, however, there has been no comparison of these two procedures in terms of diagnostic accuracy and duration. Methods: For 4 consecutive years, IUGE was performed for 104 nonpalpable breast lesions and DVAB for 128 lesions at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Of the DVAB cases, the handheld mammotome was used for 53 procedures, with all lesions removed as completely as possible. The duration of the two procedures was calculated from initial skin incision until completion of wound closure. Most of the patients with benign pathology underwent ultrasonographic examination at 3 months after surgery, with a follow-up examination at 1 year. Surgery was performed subsequently for all of the malignancy cases. Results: The average ages and mean tumor sizes for patients undergoing IUGE or DVAB were 46 and 47 years and 1.1 and 1.0 cm, respectively. The average IUGE and DVAB surgery durations for 88 benign tumors and 117 benign lesions were 44.3 and 21.5 minutes, respectively (P < 0.001), and 43.5 and 20.6 minutes for the malignant tumors (n = 16 and n = 11), respectively (P = 0.036). The IUGE and DVAB surgery durations for tumors <1 cm in diameter were 43.5 and 20.6 minutes, respectively, and 44.2 and 23.6 minutes for tumors over that size (P < 0.001). An older-model mammotome was used for 75 patients, with an average duration of 24 minutes in comparison to 18 minutes for the handheld variant (P < 0.001). No false-negative results were noted and, except in the case of the malignant tumors, there was no need for reexcisional biopsy. Further, there were no underestimates of the disease for the 4 cases of atypical ductal hyperplasia and the 12 of noninvasive carcinoma. No further ultrasonographic evidence of tumors was noted for 95% of the benign pathologies, with no residual abnormality detected for 13 of the 27 malignant tumors after IUGE or DVAB. Conclusions: For treatment of nonpalpable breast lesions, both IUGE and DVAB eliminate false-negative results, underestimates, and the requirement for reexcisional biopsies. In comparison to IUGE, DVAB is more convenient and time efficient for excisional biopsy of nonpalpable breast lesions.

0642280673	Small invasive breast carcinomas in Taiwanese women	Background: Female Taiwanese breast cancer patients are younger than their Western counterparts. This study examined the predictors of axillary lymph node metastases in Taiwanese women with T1 breast cancer. Methods: Data from 394 Taiwanese women with T1 invasive breast carcinoma were retrospectively reviewed. Results: The data contained 6 T1a, 51 T1b, and 337 T1c breast tumors. The patients' ages ranged from 23 to 82 years (mean ± SD, 48.2 ± 11.4 years; median, 46.4 years). Axillary nodal metastases were present in 38.3% of the patients (16.7% in T1a, 35.3% in T1b, and 39.2% in T1c tumors). The patients with nodal metastases had significantly greater body weights and S-phase fractions than those without nodal metastases. Univariate analysis revealed that unfavorable pathology, lymphovascular invasion, S-phase fraction >7%, and nondiploid DNA ploidy were significantly associated with lymph node metastases. Lymphovascular invasion was the only significant variable as the independent predictor in the multiple logistic regression analysis. In the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, axillary nodal status and lymphovascular invasion were significantly associated with survival. Conclusions: Taiwanese women with small breast cancer displayed a relatively higher incidence of axillary lymph node metastases than Western women. Axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy should be conducted on Taiwanese patients with small invasive breast carcinomas, particularly when risk factors exist. © 2003 The Society of Surgical Oncology, Inc.

10744227017	Intrahepatic segmental bile duct patterns in hepatolithiasis: A comparative cholangiographic study between Taiwan and Japan	Background/Purpose. We analyzed confluence patterns of intrahepatic segmental bile ducts, seeking to relate hepatolithiasis to anatomic variation. The comparative study was completed patients with hepatolithiasis in Taiwan and Japan. Methods. Direct cholangiography was performed in 103 hepatolithiasis patients in Taiwan and 77 in Japan. Segmental ducts patterns were classified as type I, normal configuration; type II, "triad" confluence; type III, posterior segmental duct joining left hepatic duct; or type IV, distal confluence of the right posterior segmental duct. Results. Taiwanese patients had only calcium bilirubinate or black stones, and were mostly female. As overall analysis, types I, II, III, and IV were found in 61, 26, 13, and 3 patients, respectively. In Japanese, types I, II, III, and IV were found in 52, 10, 13, and 2, respectively. There was no difference between the two institutes. Since no patients in Taiwan had cholesterol calculi, Japanese patients were reanalyzed including only 58 patients with calcium bilirubinate or black stones. Differences in those populations remained insignificant. Conclusion. Anatomic variations in segmental ducts apparently do not contribute to pathogenesis of hepatolithiasis.

1242292314	Analysis of sonographic features for the differentiation of benign and malignant breast tumors of different sizes	Objective: To analyze the value of various sonographic features in differentiating benign from malignant breast tumors of different sizes to improve the diagnostic accuracy in small lesions. Methods: The sonographic features of 1203 histologically confirmed solid breast lesions were prospectively documented with respect to anteroposterior (AP) diameter/width ratio, shape, margin, echogenicity, echotexture, posterior echo and bilateral refraction sign. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of breast ultrasound were calculated for lesions grouped according to size (≤ 1, 1.1-2 and > 2 cm). Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses including calculation of odds ratios for single sonographic features were used to analyze the significance of the different diagnostic features. Results: The accuracy of breast sonography in differentiating between benign and malignant tumors ≤ 1, 1.1-2 and > 2 cm in size was 75.6%, 86.4% and 88.4%, respectively. Univariate analysis demonstrated that all sonographic features were significant in tumors ≥ 1.1 cm. Shape, margin, echogenicity and echotexture were the significant factors in those tumors ≤ 1 cm. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that margin, shape, posterior echo and echogenicity were the significant factors for differential diagnosis in tumors > 2 cm. Echogenicity, margin, shape, bilateral refraction sign and echotexture were the significant factors for tumors 1.1-2 cm. On multiple regression analysis, margin was the only significant factor for tumors ≤ 1 cm. Conclusion: Tumor margin is the most important sonographic feature in evaluating breast lesions in any size group. With the combination of significant factors and emphasis on specific features according to size of lesion, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for the differential diagnosis of malignant and benign tumors may be improved.
