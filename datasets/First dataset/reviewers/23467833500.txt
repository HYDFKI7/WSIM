34648843370	Throughput study of cooperative diversity system based on truncated ARQ protocol	In this paper, the throughput of a cooperative diversity communication system based on truncated ARQ protocol is studied. The theoretical throughput expressions of cooperative diversity and two-hop systems are derived. According to the expressions, throughput is affected by the MAC layer parameter data packet length L and physical layer parameter modulation level b, so cross-layer design can be used for throughput optimization. By assuming that L and b are continuous variables, the maximum throughput is evaluated by two-dimension (2-D) continuous optimization algorithms. Then a 2-D discrete optimization algorithm is proposed to find the maximum throughput, which is practical for applications. Furthermore, with the knowledge of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) information, the 2-D algorithm is simplified into a 1-D algorithm. The 1-D discrete algorithm has only a little performance loss compared with the 2-D algorithm.

38349075937	Efficient bit error probability expression and very tight bound for maximal ratio combining diversity systems over Rayleigh fading channel	Bit Error Probability (BEP) provides a fundamental performance measure for wireless diversity systems. This paper presents two new exact BEP expressions for Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) diversity systems. One BEP expression takes a closed form, while the other is derived by treating the squared-sum of Rayleigh random variables as an Erlang variable. Due to the fact that the extant bounds are loose and could not properly characterize the error performance of MRC diversity systems, this paper presents a very tight bound. The numerical analysis shows that the new derived BEP expressions coincide with the extant expressions, and that the new approximation tightly bounds the accurate BEP. © 2008 Science Press.

84907983724	Beamforming in non-regenerative two-way multi-antenna relay networks for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer	Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is able to prolong the lifetime of energy constrained wireless networks. In this paper, we consider the relay beamforming design problem for SWIPT scheme in a non-regenerative two-way multi-antenna relay network. Our objective is to maximize the sum rate of two-way relay network under the transmit power constraint at relay and the energy harvesting (EH) constraint at EH receiver. For the non-convex EH-constrained relay beamforming optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm to find the global optimal solution based on semidefinite programming and rank-one decomposition theorem. To reduce computational complexity of global optimal solution, we transform the EH-constrained optimization problem to a difference of convex programming and propose a constrained concave convex procedure based iterative algorithm to find a local optimum. To further reduce the complexity, we propose a suboptimal solution based on the generalized eigenvectors method. When the case of multi-antenna sources is considered, we propose the alternating optimization based iterative algorithms. It is shown from simulations that considering the EH constraint, our proposed schemes outperform conventional relay beamforming schemes in the literature.

51849140448	Power optimization in fading gaussian MIMO broadcast channels	In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing long-term sum power under the constraint of an average sum rate in fading multiple input multiple output (MIMO) broadcast channels (BC) with additive Gaussian noise. This problem arises frequently in dynamic power allocation and power efficiency optimization for wireless communication systems. It is complementary to sum capacity maximization with a sum power constraint for a fading MIMO downlink. We first formulate the equivalent convex optimization problem using the duality between the MIMO multi-access channel (MAC) and the MIMO BC. Then we derive a simple and fast iterative water-filling algorithm based on the subgradient and bisection methods that computes the long-term sum power of the transmitter. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that the proposed algorithm converges to the minimum sum power globally and efficiently.

54849421826	Average-entropy variation in iterative decoding of turbo codes and its application	A new stopping criterion for turbo codes is proposed. Based on the entropy concept, a metric called average-entropy to measure the average uncertainty of the estimated bits of each iteration is derived. This metric has a close relation to the bit error rate (BER). The average-entropy decreases as BER reduces and vice versa. The proposed stopping criterion stops the iterative algorithm when there is not a, or little, reduction of the average-entropy. Compared with other well-known criteria, this new criterion reduces the average number of iterations while maintaining error correction performance. © 2008 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

60949112772	A novel low-complexity transmission power adaptation in MC-CDMA systems with a-MRC receiver over Nakagami-m fading channels	In this paper, we propose a novel low-complexity transmission power adaptation with good bit error rate (BER) performance for multicarrier code-division multiple-access (MC-CDMA) systems over Nakagami-m fading channels. We first propose a new receiver called ath-ordcr-maximal-ratio-combining (a-MRC) receiver with which the receiver power gain for the nth subcarrier is the oth (a ≥ l) power of the corresponding channel gain. Incorporating the a-MRC receiver, we then propose a new transmission power adaptation scheme where the transmission power is allocated over all the N subcarriers according to the subchannel gains and the transmitter adapts its power to maintain a constant signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) at the receiver. The proposed scheme has a significant performance gain over the nonadaptive transmission scheme over both independent and correlated fading channels. Moreover, the proposed scheme keeps good BER performance while it is much simpler than the previous power control/adaptation schemes. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper considers antenna selection on amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) MIMO relay systems to maximise capacity. Since the optimal antenna selection algorithm has high complexity, two fast algorithms are proposed. The selection criterion of the algorithm for AF relay is to maximise a lower bound of the capacity, but not the exact capacity. This criterion reduces algorithmic complexity. The algorithm for DF relay is an extension of an existing antenna subset selection algorithm for one-hop MIMO systems. The authors show the derivations of the algorithms in detail, and analyse their complexity in terms of numbers of complex multiplications. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms for both cases achieve comparable performance to the optimal algorithm under various conditions, and have decreased complexity. © 2009 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Since perfect CSI feedback is unrealistic, we further propose a power allocation scheme using limited feedback, where the power allocation vectors for the source and relay are limited in two finite power allocation tables respectively. In this scheme, the destination chooses the power allocation vectors for the source and relay, and feeds the indices of the vectors back. The power allocation tables are designed by using the Lloyd algorithm. Simulation results show that the perfect CSI feedback power allocation scheme achieves the best performance, and that the performance of the limited feedback scheme lies between the perfect CSI scheme and the scheme with no CSI.

In this paper, a practical constraint is considered that the available spectrum for the secondary users is limited in opportunistic spectrum sharing. An optimal pricing function is derived, which can provide QoS-guaranteed for the primary users and more revenue for the primary service provider. Moreover, some practical environment parameters (such as channel quality, traffic fluctuation) are taken into account in spectrum pricing. In dynamic scenarios, the price can converge to the optimal value by iteration. Simulation results show that the QoS of the primary user can be guaranteed in the proposed pricing, while the profit is not less than that in market-equilibrium-based price.

Since the optimal antenna selection rule is intractable, we propose three suboptimal antenna selection rules (rule one, two and three). While these rules all select two best antennas at the relay to maximize the SNR of relay-destination link. They have different selection criteria at the source. Rule one maximizes the SNR of source-relay link but ignores source-destination link. Oppositely, rule two maximizes the SNR of source-destination link but ignores source-relay link. Rule three considers both links together. We derive the closed-form outage probability expressions of rule one and two, and find an upper bound for the outage probability of rule three. The analysis results show that rule one and two cannot achieve full diversity order, and rule three can. Simulation results verify the analysis results. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The goal is to maximize the system throughput while meeting the delay QoS requirements of transmission services. Firstly, by integrating the effective capacity model, the subcarrier pairing and power allocation problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. Then, the problem is transformed into a continuous relaxed convex problem. By using the convex optimization theory, the optimal solution of the primal problem is obtained, and an alternative algorithm to achieve jointly optimal subcarrier pairing and power allocation is proposed. The derived analytical and simulation results show that both the optimal subcarrier pairing and power allocation depend on not only the channel quality of the subcarriers but also the delay QoS requirements of the service.

By integrating the concept of effective capacity, our goal is to maximize the system throughput subject to a given delay-QoS constraint. Based on whether the destination can receive the signal transmitted by the source, we consider two scenarios, i.e. OFDM DF relay systems without diversity and OFDM DF relay systems with diversity, respectively. For OFDM DF relay systems without diversity, we demonstrate that the jointly optimal subcarrier pairing and power allocation can be implemented with two separate steps. For OFDM DF relay systems with diversity, we propose an iterative algorithm to achieve jointly optimal subcarrier pairing and power allocation. Furthermore, we find that the analytical results show different conclusions for the two types of OFDM relay systems. For OFDM relay systems without diversity, the optimal power allocation depend on not only the channel quality of subcarriers but also the delay QoS constraints, while the optimal subcarrier pairing just depends on the channel quality of subcarriers. For OFDM relay systems with diversity, both the optimal subcarrier pairing and power allocation depend on the channel quality of subcarriers and the delay QoS constraints.

For the two SDPs, one is equivalent to the original fractional QCQP with rank-one relaxation from the Charnes-Cooper transformation and the other, exploiting the optimal value of the former SDP, always has rank-one solution, which is optimal to the former SDP. Theoretical analysis shows that our proposed non-iterative SDP-based algorithm achieves the global optimal solution to the special fractional QCQP. In specific scenarios, our proposed non-iterative SDP-based algorithm has lower computational complexity compared to the second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based and constrained concave convex procedure (CCCP)-based iterative algorithms. We apply the proposed non-iterative SDP-based algorithm on two collaborative beamforming problems in cognitive relay networks, specifically, one is the achievable rate region for two-way non-regenerative cognitive relay networks and the other is the achievable secrecy rate for one-way regenerative cognitive relay networks.

When the RS precoder is given, we propose a fast algorithm based on generalized water-filling theorem to compute the optimal SU precoders. For the imperfect CSI case, we derive equivalent conditions for the interference power constraints and convert the robust SU precoder optimization into the form of semi-definite programming. As for the robust RS precoder optimization, we relax the interference power constraint related with the RS precoder to be convex and then the GP algorithm can be applied.

The interference constraints are difficult to satisfy when the channel state information (CSI) is imperfect. In this paper, we propose a robust beamforming scheme for the multi-antenna non-regenerative cognitive relay network where the multi-antenna relay with imperfect CSIs helps the communication of single-antenna SU. Our objective is to design a robust beamforming scheme which maximizes the system capacity subject to transmit power constraint and interference constraints. The bounded channel uncertainties are modeled using the worst-case model. The robust beamforming problem, neglecting the correlation of channel uncertainties, is reformulated as a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) by rank-one relaxation. This convex SDP is related with the worst-case relay transmit power minimization problem, which is further reformulated as a convex SDP, whose rank-one solution is proved to exist. Thus, we propose the suboptimal solution to the robust beamforming problem which is found effectively by solving two convex SDPs.

The CJ-3U-IA scheme assumes that the channel fading coefficients of different time or frequency slots are independent. However, the independence of channel coefficients is not a necessary condition. For orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the channel coefficients of different frequency slots are generally not independent. In this letter, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the feasibility of the CJ-3U-IA scheme in three-user SISO OFDM systems are theoretically derived. An example has been shown that in the time domain, if a minimum of three channel impulse responses (CIRs) out of a total of nine CIRs have at least two significant taps while the other CIRs only have one significant tap, the CJ-3U-IA scheme is still feasible. © 2014 IEEE.

84901508076	Antenna selection for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in MIMO systems	For simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in multiple-input multiple-output broadcast systems, we propose to investigate the antenna selection (AS) design problem. The problem is formulated as joint AS and transmit covariance matrix design optimization problem which maximizes the achievable rate from the transmitter to the information-decoding receiver subject to the energy-harvesting constraint and the transmit power constraint. To solve the problem, we relax the binary constraints on the AS matrices and restrict the transmit covariance matrix to be diagonal. The AS matrices and the transmit covariance matrix are optimized iteratively by our proposed iterative AS algorithm. We also propose a low-complexity non-iterative norm-based algorithm which optimizes the AS matrices and the transmit covariance matrix sequentially. It is shown from simulation results that the achievable rates of proposed algorithms approach that of the AS scheme which is optimized by exhaustive search. © 2014 IEEE.

84901829711	Ergodic capacity analysis of multicast relay networks in a multicell environment	Most of the previous works on performance analysis of multicast relay networks (MRNs) have focused on noise-limited environments, where the effect of interference on MRNs has been ignored. In this paper, we investigate the performance of MRNs in a multicell environment. It is shown that the received signal to interference plus noise rations (SINRs) at the destinations are correlated due to the cochannel interference from the others. Considering the correlation, the exact outage probability and ergodic capacity are derived, based on which the diversity and coding gains are obtained. The analytical results are validated by simulations. Copyright © 2014 Acta Automatica Sinica. All rights reserved.

84902959511	Secure relay beamforming for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in nonregenerative relay networks	For simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), secure communication is an important issue. In this correspondence, we study the secure relay beamforming (SRB) scheme for SWIPT in a nonregenerative multiantenna relay network. We propose a constrained concave convex procedure (CCCP)-based iterative algorithm that is able to achieve a local optimum, where the secrecy rate is maximized, and the relay transmit power and energy harvesting constraints are satisfied. Simulation results have shown that our proposed CCCP-based iterative algorithm achieves a larger secrecy rate and lower computational complexity than the convectional SRB schemes. Since the CCCP-based iterative algorithm is still complex, we propose a semidefinite programming (SDP)-based noniterative suboptimal algorithm and a closed-form suboptimal algorithm. It is shown that when the maximum transmit power of the relay to noise power ratio is high, the SDP-based noniterative suboptimal algorithm performs close to the CCCP-based iterative algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.

84904661392	Subcarrier-pair based power allocation for cooperative OFDM AF multi-relay networks	For conventional subcarrier pairing schemes in cooperative orthogonal frequency division multiplexing amplify and forward multi-relay networks, to avoid interference, each subcarrier pair (SP) is assigned to only one relay. Over a specific subcarrier, the destination receives signals transmitted from only one relay. In our subcarrier pairing scheme, we assign each SP to all the relays. Thus, over a specific subcarrier, the destination receives signals transmitted from all the relays. Since it is assumed that there exists the direct link from the source to the destination, we assume that the source also transmits signals during the second time slot for the direct transmission mode. We propose an enhanced joint subcarrier pairing and power allocation optimization scheme which maximizes the transmission rate subject to total network power constraint. The problem is simplified and solved by using dual method. It is shown from simulation results that our proposed scheme outperforms the other schemes. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84904397765	Resource allocation for OFDM relay systems with statistical QoS guarantees	By integrating the concept of effective capacity, we propose the resource allocation schemes for subcarrier-pair based OFDM decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward relay systems for quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. The objective is to maximize the system throughput subject to a given statistical delay QoS constraint. First, we pair the subcarriers over the source-relay channel and the relay-destination channel by the descending order of the subcarriers' channel gains. Second, by making use of the derived equivalent end-to-end channel gains of the subcarrier pairs, we apply joint water-filling power allocation over the subcarrier pairs and then partition the power of the subcarrier pairs between the source and the relay. We prove that as the equivalent end-to-end channel gains of the subcarrier pairs are given, the combination of sorted subcarrier pairing and joint water-filling power allocation is jointly optimal to maximize the effective capacity. The simulation results show that our proposed schemes achieve the highest effective capacity for OFDM decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward relay systems as compared with other existing schemes. The results also verify that our proposed schemes can efficiently provide different levels of delay QoS guarantees, even if under the stringent delay QoS constraints.

84907000452	Equalizing multihop OFDM relay channel under unknown channel orders and Doppler frequencies	In this paper, equalization of multihop relaying orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is investigated under time-varying channel with unknown noise powers, channel orders and Doppler frequencies. An iterative algorithm is developed under variational expectation maximization (EM) framework. The proposed algorithm iteratively estimates the channel, learns the channel and noise statistical information, and recovers the unknown data, using only limited number of pilot subcarrier in one OFDM symbol. Simulation results show that, without any statistical information, the performance of the proposed algorithm is very close to that of the optimal channel estimation and data detection algorithm, which requires specific information on system structure, channel tap positions, channel lengths, Doppler shifts as well as noise powers. © 2014 IEEE.

84907187527	Robust transceiver design for wireless information and power transmission in underlay MIMO cognitive radio networks	In this letter, we investigate the robust transceiver design problem for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in multiple-input-multiple-output underlay cognitive radio networks where the channel uncertainties are modeled by the worst-case model. Our objective is to maximize the sum harvested power at energy harvesting receivers while guaranteeing the required minimum mean-square-error at the secondary information-decoding (ID) receiver and the interference constraints at the primary receivers. We propose to alternatively optimize the transmit covariance matrix at secondary transmitter and the preprocessing matrix at secondary ID receiver. Simulation results have shown that the robust transceiver design has significant performance gain over the non-robust one.

84909998323	Random Correlation-Based Receiver for Impulse Radio Communications in UWB Channels	Impulse radio is a low-complexity ultra-wideband system which is suitable for highly dispersive multipath channel. In this paper, we propose a random correlation-based receiver for impulse radio communications. The proposed receiver correlates the received pilot symbols with the randomly generated base functions according to channel statistics and forms the detection template by combining several base functions which have larger correlation coefficients with the pilot symbols. The proposed receiver demodulates the received signal by employing a symbol rate sampling. Computer simulation results have shown that the proposed receiver outperforms the conventional correlator-based receiver, compressive sensing correlator-based receiver, weighted energy detector and autocorrelation receiver.

We show the constraint optimization problem can be converted to the unconstraint one and then we employ Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to search the optimal precoding vector. It is verified from computer simulation results that the proposed scheme can obtain larger average sum rate than zero forcing (ZF) and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Quasi-Newton (BFGS-QN) algorithm with moderate complexity.

84911991099	Nearly optimal linear transceiver design for amplify-and-forward MIMO multiple-relay systems under MMSE criterion	In this paper, we consider amplify-and-forward multiple-input multiple-output multiple-relay systems, where all the nodes have multiple antennas. For enhancing link reliability, we address the problem of designing optimal linear transceiver to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of symbol estimations subject to the total relay transmit power constraint. This problem is highly complex and has not been solved in the literature. We first simplify this optimization problem to one that takes a singular value vector and a unitary matrix as optimization variables. Then based on the analyses for the simplified problem, we develop an iterative algorithm consisting of one boundary optimization and one unitary matrix constrained optimization. We show analytically that the proposed iterative algorithm always converges, and the MSE is monotonically decreasing from one iteration to the next. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the nearly optimal performance of the proposed scheme.

84914681833	QoS-driven jointly optimal subcarrier pairing and power allocation for OFDM amplify-and-forward relay systems	In this paper, we investigate the quality-of-service (QoS) driven subcarrier pairing and power allocation for two-hop amplify-and-forward OFDM relay systems. By integrating the concept of effective capacity, our goal is to maximize the system throughput subject to a given delay QoS constraint. We propose a jointly optimal subcarrier pairing and power allocation scheme, which can be implemented with two separate steps. First, pair the subcarriers over the source-relay channel and relay-destination channel by the descending order of the subcarriers' channel gains. Second, by making use of the derived equivalent end-to-end channel gains of the subcarrier pairs, optimally allocate power over the subcarrier pairs, and then optimally partition the power of the subcarrier pairs between the source and the relay. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can efficiently provide different levels of delay QoS guarantees, even if under stringent delay QoS constraints. The simulation results also verify that our proposed scheme shows significant superiorities over the other existing schemes.

84919491575	Optimal power allocation for multicarrier secure communications in full-duplex decode-and-forward relay networks	For full-duplex (FD) relay networks, secure communication is an important issue. In this letter, considering decode-and-forward scheme, we investigate the optimal power allocation for multicarrier secure communication in FD relay networks. Our objective is to maximize the achievable secrecy rate of FD relay network subject to sum power constraint of the source and FD relay. The formulated nonconvex optimization problem is equivalently transformed into a convex problem. Employing Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, we obtain a closed-form solution to the optimization problem. Simulation results have shown that the proposed optimal power allocation scheme for FD relaying outperforms that for conventional half-duplex relaying.
