0034216934	Influence of throat area of furnace chamber on the aerodynamics for W-Shape boiler	Cool state modeled experimental investigation has been made in a model of the 360 MW W-shape flame boiler imported by Luohuang Power Station from Stein corporation in France. The flow field in the boiler was measured by a hot-wire anemometer. Flow field patterns were obtained for different relative throat areas of furnace chamber. Analyses and comparison of velocity distribution were made in addition to examining the fullness of air flow and the flow rate of average efficient momentum in the boiler. It is beneficial to firing and burning out of pulverized coal injected into furnace chamber with reduced throat area. This can decrease the lash of high temperature gas against throat, front and rear arches of furnace chamber as well as cool ash bucket. Attainment of lower furnace clinker in these positions is thus made possible. High temperature gas washing out front and rear walls of furnace can also be dropped such that high temperature corrosion of water cooling walls can be reduced.

Experiments indicate that there are four screech tone modes of supersonic jet collision, switched from one mode to another depending on the nozzle distance and jet pressure. Two normal shock waves are present between nozzles as jet pressure is more than 0.5 MPa and nozzle distance is less than 50 mm, radiating a stable screech tone with a frequency of about 3 kHz. With nozzle distance increasing or jet pressure decreasing, a bow shock is present at one nozzle exit and a normal shock wave appears at the other exit with the collision surface oscillating between them. Collision surface might be kept balanced in the centre of two nozzles with a 9 kHz frequency screech tone, however, it is vulnerable to disturbance and would return to the equilibrium position near nozzle exit or oscillate between nozzles with large amplitude. When jet pressure is less than 0.36 MPa and nozzle distance greater than 70 mm, the collision surface substantially oscillates between the nozzles, radiating a screech tone with a frequency of about 1 kHz which decreases with jet pressure decreasing and nozzle distance increasing. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society.

The exploratory research shows that constant section straight detonation tube can self-aspirate from the open end at the low pressure in the tube after the purge process. However, the gas inhaled was almost totally exhaust gas which cannot be used for the next cycle. The separation of intake port and exhaust port can improve the quality of the inhaled gas. The far the intake port departs from the exhaust port the less influence the exhaust gas has and the better the self-aspiration quality will be. Pressure difference between the intake port and the exhaust port should exist. Otherwise, gas will be inhaled in from the two ports simultaneously forming gas oscillation in the tube and blocking up some exhaust-gas in the middle of the tube. With the help of designed aerodynamic valve the detonation tube can self-aspirate from the front end at the end of the purging process filling the tube with fresh air, which can be used for the next cycle.

84858428436	Investigation and simulation of dielectric barrier discharge under high frequency and high voltage	With the experimental facility and measurement system of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), this paper studied the characteristic of plasma assisted combustion (PAC) actuator discharge under different thickness dielectric layers, applied voltage and air gap distance. On the basis of the experimental data, the parameters such as the terminal voltages and the discharge current on the air gap clearance are calculated according to an equivalent circuit. The results show that, the thickness of medium strongly influences discharge pulse times; with the increasing of applied voltage, discharge pulse times increases, and discharge starting time continuously brings forward; while with the decreasing of air gap distance, actuator discharge intensity distinctly enhances, and the discharge is more uniformity.

84858848258	Experimental study of reverse-discharge in dielectric barrier discharge	The influences of such factors as amplitude of applied voltage, air gap distance, and thickness of dielectric layer on characteristic of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) were investigated with the established experimental DBD system and the corresponding measurement system, and the experimental data was theoretically analyzed with the theory of gas discharge. The results show that with the decreasing of dielectric layer thickness, air gap distance, or amplitude of applied voltage, the number of DBD current pulse increases and the needed voltage for air breakdown decreases due to surface charges. Sufficient electric field intensity of surface charges will lead to reverse-discharge on the falling edge of applied voltage.

84862319466	Investigation on the effects of deflector structure on detonation initiation by shock wave focusing	To investigate the effects of depth and angle of deflector on detonation initiation via shock wave focusing in a 2-stage PDE, detonation initiation with different deflector depth and angle was simulated and hydrogen-air mixture was used in this study. The results indicate that a deeper deflector has a favorable effect on detonation initiation and can produce higher temperature and pressure at initiation point. When the deflector angle is small, the operation frequency and the net impulse of the device as a whole per second decrease as the deflector becomes deeper. With the deflector angle increasing, however, a deeper deflector corresponds to higher operation frequency and net impulse. In addition, as the deflector angle increases, both temperature and pressure at initiation point undergo an increase first, obtaining maximal value at 25°, and then followed by decreasing a increasing deflector angle also produces an earlier initiation moment, increase of operation frequency and net impulse.

We could obtain the body force distribution function of plasma aerodynamic effect through solving the electric potential equation and charge density equation. Moreover, we introduced momentum to Navier-Stokes equations in the form of source term. By numerically simulating the chamber air flow which was induced by plasma aerodynamic effect in the combustion-supporting actuator, we studied the effect of excitation voltage, gas flow and charge density on the plasma aerodynamic effect. The results show that, under the plasma aerodynamic effect, chamber flow turbulence increases, velocity distribution becomes non-uniform; as the excitation voltage increases, the concussion amplitude of chamber axial velocity increases; as the inlet velocity increases, plasma aerodynamic effect on chamber decreases continuously; as the charge density increases, the concussion amplitude of chamber axial velocity at the front and back of flame holder continuously aggravates.

84863372009	Characteristic study of DC electric arc plasma ignitor jet	The spectrometer was adopted to measure the emission spectrum of Ar plasma jet at the ignitor exit. Boltzmann curve slope method was applied to calculate the jet electron temperature. Ionization equilibrium equation was used to calculate jet temperature and measure the laws that jet length, jet velocity, electron temperature and jet temperature of ignitor exit change with arc current and inlet Ar flow rate. Whether the electron temperature could be used to replace jet temperature in aircraft plasma arc jet was also discussed. The experiment results show that arc current reduces with the rising of inlet Ar flowrate; exit jet length and velocity increase with the rising of arc current, and increase at first and then reduce with the rising of inlet Ar flow rate; exit electron temperature, electron density and jet temperature increase with the rising of arc current and reduce with the rising of inlet Ar flow rate.

Experiments on non-reaction three-dimensional shock wave focus were conducted. It is found that resonant frequency increases with the increase of the incidence angle of resonator. As airflow exit area decreases, resonant frequency of resonator increases and the dynamic pressure amplitude of resonator bottom increases. As nozzle diverging angle increases, the highest alpha-frequency increases and the quantity of beta-frequency increases. When the nozzle diverging angle is 30°, the dynamic pressure amplitude of resonator bottom is maximal. As 'L' increases, resonant frequency decreases and the dynamic pressure amplitude of resonator bottom decreases.

84877908149	Numerical simulation of inlet parameters influence on plasma ignition process	To investigate the influence of inlet parameters on plasma ignition processes, the chemical reaction of plasma ignition and the change in flow field were numerically simulated after establishing a numerical calculation model of the plasma ignition combustion. Then the influence of jet velocity, jet temperature and mixed gas's inlet velocity on the plasma ignition process was analyzed. The calculation results show that, when high temperature plasma jet gets into the combustion chamber, the combustion region extended to the upstream is much larger than that to the downstream, and stable combustion forms in the upstream firstly. The effect of plasma jet velocity on ignition delay time is relatively small, but the increase of jet velocity can enforce the plasma jet's penetration ability. The mixed gas's ignition delay time increases with decreasing jet temperature and increasing inlet velocity of the mixed gas.

The discharge voltage and current were measured in air in both breakdown and stable combustion processes, respectively, and the current-zero phenomena, voltage-current (V-I) characteristics were studied for different working gas flow rates. The results indicated that the working gas between anode and cathode could be ionized to generate gas discharge when the voltage reached 8 kV, and the maximum current was 33.36 A. When the current came to zero, current-zero phenomena appeared with duration of 2 μs. At the current-zero moment, dynamic resistance between electrodes became extremely high, and the maximum value could reach 445 kΩ, which was the main factor to restrain the current. With increasing working gas flow rates, the gradient of V-I characteristic curves was increased, as was the dynamic resistance. At a constant driven power, the discharge voltage increased.
