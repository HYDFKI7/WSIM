Thirty two healthy rabbits were involved in the whole experiment. Qi-stagnancy and blood stasis rabbits were obtained by treating the limbs of 16 adnephrin rabbits in an ice-bath for 6.0 min. The rest of rabbits were equally divided into 2 healthy groups. One healthy group and 8 qi-stagnancy and blood stasis rabbits were orally administrated with SM (5.0 g/kg), and the other 8 healthy rabbits and 8 qi-stagnancy and blood stasis rabbits with SM (5.0 g/kg) coupled with DO (2.5 g/kg). The plasma (Danshensu) concentration-time curve was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-trap mass (MS-MS). Danshensu in plasma was confirmed to be two-compartment open model with a first order absorption phase in all groups. Moreover, the area under curve (0-∞) of Danshensu was significantly increased both in healthy group and in qi-stagnancy and blood stasis group after administration of SM coupled with DO.

40849086135	Novel tetrazole-functionalized ion exchanger for weak cation-exchange chromatography of proteins	A new type of weak cation exchanger, tetrazole-functionalized silica, was developed for bioseparation. It was prepared conveniently by modifying silica gel initially with γ-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, then with 3-hydroxypropionitrile and finally with ammonium-catalyzed (3 + 2) azide-nitrile cycloaddition, which is an element of click chemistry. The prepared stationary phase was characterized and evaluated for its separation performance, protein retention behavior, loading capacity, protein recovery and chemical stability. The results show that the stationary phase developed has excellent performance for protein separations with high mass recoveries, and has long-term stability. Some remarkable differences were observed between this new exchanger and a carboxylic methyl-functionalized ion exchanger, which is typically used in weak cation-exchange chromatography of proteins. The obtained column was also used for the purification of lysozyme from chicken egg white, and the purity and specific bioactivity of the obtained lysozyme were about 90% and 67 IU/mg, respectively. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

All rabbits were administrated with an extraction of Salvia miltiorrhiza and S. miltiorrhiza coupled with Lignum dalbergiae odoriferae. The main compounds in plasma samples were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography/ diode array detector/electrospray-mass spectrometry (HPLC/DAD/ESI-MS). The data were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that Qi-stagnancy and blood stasis had a close relationship with dopamine. In addition, the results also indicated that the major plasma metabolic difference between rabbits administrated with S. miltiorrhiza and S. miltiorrhiza coupled with Lignum dalbergiae odoriferae were 4-methylbenzamide, Danshensu and β-(3,4-dihydroxybenzene)-α-hydroxyl propanoic acid isopropyl ester.

84877294714	Effects of borneol on pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of notoginsenoside R1 and ginsenosides Rg1 and Re in Panax notoginseng in rabbits	The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Borneol on the pharmacokinetics of notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) and the ginsenosides Rg1 (GRg1) and Re (GRe) in Panax notoginseng. Reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry was employed to determine the concentrations of the three compounds in rabbit plasma. In comparison with rabbits administrated Panax notoginseng extract alone, animals simultaneously taking Panax notoginseng extract and Borneol exhibited significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters of NGR1, GRg1, and GRe, such as increasing their bioavailability. Quantities of NGR1, GRg1, and GRe in rabbit tissues were also increased after combining administration of Borneol. In addition, the apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) of NGR1, GRg1, and GRe were raised by Borneol significantly in Caco-2 cells. However, no significant changes were observed in the efflux ratio (Er) of NGR1, GRg1 and GRe. These data indicate that Borneol has the properties of enhancing the intestinal absorption, increasing the distribution, and inhibiting the metabolism of NGR1, GRg1, and GRe. The underlying mechanism might be attributed to the loosening of the intercellular tight junction. © 2013 Shixiang Wang et al.

77956008146	Metabolism of tanshinol borneol ester in rat and human liver microsomes	Tanshinol borneol ester (DBZ) is an experimental drug that exhibits efficacious anti-ischemic activity in rats. Although the specific metabolic properties of DBZ are still unknown, previous studies in rats have strongly suggested that DBZ is extensively metabolized after administration and thus probably acts as a prodrug. Because the enzymes involved in drug metabolism differ between humans and rats in isoform composition, expression, and catalytic activity, the pharmacokinetics of the same drug in the two species may also differ. Establishing the differences between DBZ metabolism in human and rat liver microsomes can help to predict DBZ pharmacokinetics in humans and aid in the assessment of its potential efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism of action. In this work, the microsomal stabilities and metabolic kinetics of DBZ in rat and human liver microsomes were compared, and the DBZ metabolites generated in human liver microsomes (HLMs) were identified. The results suggested that DBZ is more stable in HLMs than in rat liver microsomes (RLMs). The intrinsic clearance of DBZ in HLMs was 10- to 17-fold lower than that in RLMs, which indicates lower DBZ clearance in humans. Metabolite analysis suggested that DBZ is hydroxylated by liver microsomal enzymes, resulting in the production of five metabolites. Although the kinetics of metabolite formation in HLMs and RLMs were different, the same metabolites were generated, indicating that the same metabolic pathway is present in both species. The results obtained from this work suggest the potential for DBZ to act as a prodrug with anti-ischemic activity in humans.

78649618459	Evaluation of the effects of cytochrome P450 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms on tanshinol borneol ester metabolism and inhibition potential	Nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in cytochrome P450 (P450) genes may affect drug metabolism and drug-drug interactions (DDIs), potentially leading to adverse drug reactions. Functional characterization of the nsSNPs in P450 genes is important to help us understand the impact of genetic factors on P450-mediated drug metabolism and DDIs. To evaluate the effects of P450 nsSNPs on the metabolism and inhibition potential of a candidate drug, tanshinol borneol ester (DBZ), we obtained and experimentally validated eight yeast-expressed human P450 isoforms and their nsSNP variants and tested DBZ using these recombinant P450 enzymes. The results suggested that CYP2C8 is the major enzyme responsible for DBZ metabolism. In addition, compared with prototypic CYP2C8, the allelic variant, CYP2C8.3, produced a 54% decrease in the intrinsic clearance of DBZ. The inhibitory potency of DBZ toward CYP3A4 was greater than that toward other P450 isoforms, including CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Moreover, the inhibitory potency toward three CYP3A4 allelic variants, CYP3A4.2, CYP3A4.12, and CYP3A4.16, was reduced 2- to 10-fold relative to prototype CYP3A4. These results provide useful information for understanding the influence of P450 genetic polymorphisms on DBZ metabolism and may help to design future clinical trials of DBZ. Our results suggest applications for in vitro P450 assays both for basic research in pharmacogenomics and for drug development.

83755195393	DBZ blocks Lps-induced monocyte activation and foam cell formation via inhibiting nuclear factor-κB	Background/Aims: It has been widely accepted that chronic inflammation plays important roles in the atherogenesis. Danshensu Bingpian Zhi (DBZ) is a novel synthetic compound derived from the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula Fu Fang Dan Shen (FFDS), which is effective on atherosclerosis clinically. We hypothesized that DBZ possessed the anti-atherosclerosis potentials. Here, we examined the inhibitory effects of DBZ on LPS-induced monocyte activation and foam cell formation. Methods: The effects of DBZ were assessed on LPS-induced inflammatory factors expression in monocyte/macrophage. Activation of NF-κB and AP-1 was analyzed by luciferase reporter assay and signaling pathway of NF-κB was investigated to elucidate mechanisms underlying DBZ mediated anti-inflammatory activity. Effects of DBZ on macrophage lipid accumulation were evaluated in native LDL and LPS co-incubated macrophages. Results: DBZ inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory factors expression dose dependently in monocytes. DBZ inhibited NF-κB activation strongly and AP-1 slightly. DBZ suppressed the LPS-induced degradation of IκBα, thereby decreasing the translocation of p65 to nucleus. Furthermore, DBZ suppressed LPS-activated macrophages lipid accumulation, partly due to inhibiting the expression of LPS-induced aP2 and ADRP in macrophges. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that DBZ has potentials on anti-atherosclerosis by suppressing monocyte activation and foam cell formation. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.

84866978029	Construction of adrenergic receptor subtype affinity chromatographic models for detection of ligand-receptor interactions	Adrenergic receptors (ARs) are members of the super family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A large number of small molecular drugs performed their actions on ARs. In this study, two subtypes of ARs affinity chromatographic models have been constructed for investigating the interactions between small molecular compounds and the α- and β-AR subtypes. The α-ARs were obtained from HEK 293 cells stably transfected human α-ARs on the membrane and the β-ARs were obtained from lung tissues of rabbits. ARs were purified and immobilized on the surface of macro-pore silica gel by covalent bonds. Then the gel was packed into a stainless steel column (4.6 × 50 mm). Binding abilities between small molecules and immobilized ARs were determined by on-line chromatographic technologies.

84868665453	Anti-inflammatory effects of isopropyl 3-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxypropanoate, a novel metabolite from Danshen, on activated microglia	Down-regulation of microglial activation represents a practical strategy for combating diverse brain disorders such as stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we showed evidence that isopropyl 3-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxypropanoate (IDHP), a new bioactive metabolite of Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge), exerted an anti-inflammatory effect in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- induced microglia. Our data showed that IDHP significantly reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in LPS-induced BV-2 cells and rat primary microglia in a dose-dependent manner. IDHP also suppressed mRNA expression of LPSinduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNF-α and IL-1β. Moreover, IDHP significantly suppressed the production of ROS, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) translocation and DNA binding activity induced by LPS treatment in BV-2 cells. These findings indicated that IDHP might be of value in the treatment of various microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory diseases.

84873811862	Effects of ionic liquid and nanogold particles on high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection and their application in highly efficient separation and sensitive analysis of five phenolic acids in Xuebijing injection	A novel high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD) analytical system was developed in this study by integratedly utilizing ionic liquid (IL) of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide and an additive of gold nanoparticles. The resulted pilot study was first performed to assess the effects of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide and gold nanoparticles on the chromatographic characteristics of five phenolic acids in Xuebijing injection, including danshensu (DSS), protocatechuic acid (PA), protocatechuic aldehyde (PAH), hydroxy safflower yellow A (HSYA) and ferulic acid (FA). It was notable to observe that retainability of the phenolic acids were markly lowered by IL addition. Compared with the cases without IL addition, the retention times of DSS, PA, PAH, HSYA and FA have decreased 2.851, 1.532, 1.53, 0.818 and 0.552 min, respectively when 0.6% IL in the mobile phase. In addition, the corresponding theoretical plate numbers and peak areas for these compounds were significantly increased. Area response for DSS, PA, PAH, HSYA and FA were enhanced by 772%, 628%, 584%, 703% and 600%, respectively. It was observed that nano-gold catalysis power enabled peak areas of DSS, PAH, FA and PA to enhance 5.7, 6.2, 8.5 and 66.5 times relative to the case with addition of IL. Altogether, the optimized HPLC-ECD system was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetics study of Xuebijing injection with underlying applicability to in vivo and in vitro analysis of a variety of natural product from Chinese medicine plants, TCM formulae and associated patent TCM preparation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84876540409	Liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry for identification of in vitro and in vivo metabolites of bornyl gallate in rats	Bornyl gallate (BG) is a potential drug candidate synthesized by the reaction of two natural products, gallic acid and borneol. Previous studies have strongly suggested that BG is worthy of further investigation due to antioxidant, antiatherosclerosis activities, and obvious activity of stimulating intersegmental vessel growth in zebrafish. This work was designed to elucidate the metabolic profile of BG through analyzing its metabolites in vitro and in vivo by a chromatographic separation coupled with a mass spectrometry. The metabolites of BG were characterized from the rat liver microsome incubation solution, as well as rat urine and plasma after oral administration. Chromatographic separation was performed on an Agilent TC-Ccolumn (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 m) with gradient elution using methanol and water containing 0.2% (V: V) formic acid as the mobile phase. Metabolites identification involved analyzing the retention behaviors, changes of molecular weights and MS/MS fragment patterns of BG and the metabolites. Five compounds were identified as isomers of hydroxylated BG metabolites in vitro. The major metabolites of BG in rat urine and plasma proved to be BG-O-glucuronide and O-methyl BG-O-glucuronide. The proposed method confirmed to be a reliable and sensitive alternative for characterizing metabolic pathways of BG. © 2013 Wei Lan et al.

84879372525	Tanshinone IIA and Baicalin inhibiting the formation of benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene induced cytotoxicity: Correlation with scavenging free radical	Benzo[. a]pyrene (BaP), a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, is formed by incomplete combustion of organic materials, and causes oxidative damage to cells and tissues due to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The purpose of this study is to investigate the inhibition of Tanshinone IIA and Baicalin on the formation of BaP as well as the cytotoxicity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) induced by BaP. The results showed that BaP formations in mainstream smoke were inhibited by 21. μg/cigarette of Tanshinone IIA with a 12.8% decrease, and by 60. μg/cigarette of Baicalin with an 11.1% decrease, respectively. Tanshinone IIA could protect HUVECs from the damage caused by BaP in a dose-dependent manner from 7.5 to 30. μg/ml. 6. μg/ml Baicalin significantly increased the cell survival rate from 47.37% to 84.21% compared with BaP-treated cells. Both Tanshinone IIA and Baicalin markedly attenuated the increase of LDH release, enhanced the activity of SOD and GPx and inhibited the generation of MDA in BaP-damaged HUVECs in vitro. In vivo exploration showed that the two compounds were capable of enhancing the activity of SOD and inhibiting generation of MDA in mainstream smoke-damaged in mice. Superoxide anion radical and hydroxyl radical were obviously inhibited by Tanshinone IIA and Baicalin. These data demonstrate an inhibition of Tanshinone IIA and Baicalin on the formation of BaP and the cytotoxicity on HUVECs related to free Radical induced by BaP. © 2013.

Rat plasma was pretreated by mixture of acetonitrile and chloroform to precipitate plasma proteins. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a column (50 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm) with a mobile phase consisting of water (containing 5 × 10-3 M ammonium formate, pH was adjusted to 3.0 with formic acid) and acetonitrile (20:80, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. A tandem mass spectrometric detection with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface was conducted via collision induced dissociation (CID) under negative ionization mode. The MS/MS transitions monitored were m/z 343.0448 → m/z 313.2017 for usnic acid and m/z 153.1024 → m/z 136.2136 for protocatechuic acid (internal standard). The linear range was calculated to be 2.0-160.0 ng/mL with a detection limit of 3.0 pg/mL. The inter-and intra-day accuracy and precision were within ± 7.0%. Pharmacokinetic study showed that the apartment of usnic acid in vivo confirmed to be a two compartment open model.

Electrochemical characterization of the modified electrode was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The poly(new coccine) modified CPE exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of dopamine (DA), acetaminophenol (AP) and tryptophan (Trp) simultaneously. Well defined and separated oxidation peaks were observed by CV. Linear calibration plots for the oxidation of DA, AP and Trp were obtained in the range of 0.7-200 μM for DA, 1.5-120 μM for AP, and 0.6-50 μM for Trp. Detection limits of DA, AP and Trp were found to be 0.2, 0.3 and 0.2 μM, respectively. With good selectivity and sensitivity, the present method has been successfully applied to the determination of DA, AP and Trp in pharmaceutical samples. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84891783277	Bornyl caffeate induces apoptosis in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells via the ROS-and JNK-mediated pathways	Aim: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the anticancer activity of bornyl caffeate in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Methods: The cell viability was determined using the MTT assay, and apoptosis was initially defined by monitoring the morphology of the cell nuclei and staining an early apoptotic biomarker with Annexin V-FITC. The mitochondrial membrane potential was visualized by JC-1 under fluorescence microscopy, whereas intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed by flow cytometry. The expression of apoptosis-associated proteins was determined by Western blotting analysis. Results: Bornyl caffeate induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Consistently, bornyl caffeate increased Bax and decreased Bcl-xl, resulting in the disruption of MMP and subsequent activation of caspase-3. Moreover, bornyl caffeate triggered the formation of ROS and the activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Antioxidants attenuated the activation of MAP kinase p38 but barely affected the activation of JNK. Importantly, the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate was partially attenuated by scavenging ROS and inhibited by MAP kinases and caspases. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that bornyl caffeate induced apoptosis in the cancer cell line MCF-7 via activating the ROS-and JNK-mediated pathways. Thus, bornyl caffeate may be a potential anticancer lead compound. © 2013 CPS.

84896392200	Reversing P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance in vitro by α-asarone and β-asarone, bioactive cis-trans isomers from Acorus tatarinowii	P-Glycoprotein (P-gp), an ATP-binding cassette transporter, plays an important role in multidrug resistance (MDR). α-Asarone and β-asarone, bioactive cis-trans isomers found in Acorus tatarinowii Schott, were tested for their potential ability to modulate the expression and function of P-gp in Caco-2 cells. MTT assays revealed that both α-asarone and β-asarone significantly enhanced the vincristine-induced cytotoxicity to cells. β-Asarone was the most potent. Flow cytometry showed that α- and β-asarone increased Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) uptake and inhibited Rh123 efflux in Caco-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, P-gp expression and P-gp mRNA in cells were decreased by exposure to α- and β-asarone. In addition, β-asarone increased the inhibition of P-gp activity in cells more than α-asarone. Thus, α- and β-asarone effectively reversed MDR by inhibiting P-gp function and expression. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84901798220	Cold water forced swimming stress induced metabolic alterations in rats	Forced swimming in cold water causes physiological and psychological stress that leads to altered biochemical homeostasis and neurobehavioral responses. In this study, plasma and urinary metabolites in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats subjected to cold water forced swimming stress (CWFSS) were characterized using NMR in conjunction with multivariate data analysis. Metabolic analysis demonstrated that decreased levels of lipoprotein and increased levels of O-acetyl glycoprotein, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, creatine, citrate, succinate and amino acids including phenylalanine, tyrosine, glutamate, valine, isoleucine, alanine and lysine in plasma were observed in response to CWFSS. Moreover, the biochemical response to CWFSS as determined from NMR analysis of urine was characterized by an elevation of gut microbiota-related metabolites including phenylacetylglycine, 4-cresol glucuronide and indoxyl sulfate. These results suggest that CWFSS-induced metabolic perturbations were involved in the disruption of amino acid and energy metabolism as well as the alteration of gut microbiota function.

84901850611	Danshensu inhibits β-adrenergic receptors-mediated cardiac fibrosis by ROS/p38 MAPK axis	Danshensu, the effective ingredient of the plant Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), has been widely used for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Cardiac fibrosis is an important process in pathological cardiac remodeling and leads to heart failure. We investigated the effect of Danshensu on β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)-mediated cardiac fibrosis and the involved signaling transduction. Danshensu inhibited cardiofibroblast proliferation and collagen I synthesis induced by isoproterenol (ISO), a selective β-AR agonist. Phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which mediates ISO-induced cardiac fibrosis, was negatively regulated in this process. The negative regulation depended on the ISO inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Taken together, Danshensu may inhibit β-AR-mediated cardiac fibrosis by negative regulation of ROS-p38 MAPK signaling. © 2014 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

84902654117	Biochemical mechanisms of bornyl caffeate induced cytotoxicity in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells	The chemopreventive and antineoplastic activities of caffeic acid derivatives are highly dependent on the chemical structures and cancer cell types. The objective of the present study was to investigate the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate and the underlying molecular mechanisms in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Our initial studies demonstrated that bornyl caffeate exhibited potent cytotoxicity in PC12 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. By examining the cell morphology on a fluorescence microscope and detecting the cell surface phosphoserine with Annexin V-FITC, we proposed that bornyl caffeate could induce apoptosis in PC12 cells. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the effects of bornyl caffeate on several apoptosis-related biomarkers. These experiments showed that bornyl caffeate induced the up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-xl, the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, the activation of caspase 3 and the cleavage of PARP. Mechanistic studies further revealed that bornyl caffeate caused the depletion of glutathione (GSH), generation of superoxide ion and progressive activation of p38 mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in a concentration-dependent manner. In particular, GSH depletion appeared to be the most important mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity of bornyl caffeate. The preservation of the intracellular GSH contents with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), GSH and vitamin C abolished the effect of bornyl caffeate on the activation of p38 MAPK and JNK, preserved the integrity of mitochondrial membrane and ultimately rescued the cells from drug-induced cell death. These results suggest that bornyl caffeate induces apoptosis in PC12 cells via stimulating the depletion of GSH, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84907153595	Metabolomic analysis provides novel chemotaxonomic characteristics for phenotypic cultivars of tree peony	Metabolomic analysis is an important molecular phenotyping method for understanding plant ecotypic variations. Here, we systematically characterized the metabolomic variations associated with five Chinese cultivars of tree peony (Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews) using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and multivariate data analysis. Our results indicated that the metabolite profile of the root bark in tree peony was largely dominated by 5 primary metabolites and 41 secondary ones including 7 phenolics, 7 flavonoids, 16 monoterpene glycosides and 11 acetophenones. The distribution of these secondary metabolites varied in the different tree peony cultivars. Some secondary metabolites, such as galloyl glucoses, procyanidins, mudanpiosides and acetophenones, will become the novel and potential chemotaxonomic markers to differentiate tree peony cultivars when the conventional classification methods are not practicable. These results demonstrated that HPLC-MS based metabolomics was an effective tool for the classification of phenotypic cultivars and provided novel and potential chemotaxonomic characteristics of tree peony.

HAuCl<inf>4</inf> and pepsin (Pep) could significantly enhance the luminol chemiluminescence (CL) intensity. It was found that sub-nanometre Au nanoclusters (AuNCs) were generated in the luminol-HAuCl<inf>4</inf>-Pep reaction solution. A possible mechanism for AuNCs generation is given. By means of the FI-CL and molecular docking (MD) methods, the Pep-CAP interaction was systematically studied. The results showed that CAP might enter into Pep active site Asp32 with the binding constant (K) 1.7 × 10<sup>6</sup> L mol<sup>-1</sup>, which could effectively inhibit the CL intensity. The CL intensity could be remarkably inhibited by CAP and the decrement of CL intensity was linearly correlated to the logarithm of CAP concentration in the range of 3.0 pmol L<sup>-1</sup> to 0.1 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>, with a detection limit of 1.0 pmol L<sup>-1</sup> (3σ). This proposed approach was successfully applied to determine CAP in rabbit's blood during the 16 h after intragastric administration with an elimination ratio of 45.9% and recovery ratios from 89.0% to 112.0%. The pharmacokinetic results showed that CAP could be rapidly absorbed into blood with a peak concentration (C<inf>max</inf>) of 9.63 ± 1.45 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> at a maximum peak time (T<inf>max</inf>) of 0.75 ± 0.08 h; the elimination half-life of 3.19 ± 0.13 h and the elimination rate constant of 7.27 ± 0.41 L g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> in rabbits were derived, respectively.

84921524279	Quality evaluation of Moutan Cortex at different growth stages	Objective: To evaluate the quality of Moutan Cortex at different growth stages. Methods: Metabonomics based on high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/Q-TOF-MS) was applied to find the variation of different growth stages. Results: Forty-six metabolites were identified by MS molecular ions and major fragments in conjugation with literature data. The results of principal component analysis showed that the constituent of Moutan Cortex at three growth stages were obviously different. The levels of 13 metabolites were related to the growth time of Moutan Cortex. One-year-old Moutan Cortex contained higher levels of malic acid and gallic acid, suggesting the requirement of sufficient materials for growth and synthesis of complicated secondary metabolites at the first stage. However, in two- and three-years-old Moutan Cortex the levels of some important active compounds such as paeonol and monoterpene glucosides increased. It could be deduced that within three years grouth, good quality of Moutan Cortex was associated with the longer growth time. Conclusion: These results provide the evidence for the quality evaluation of Moutan Cortex at different growth stages, and demonstrate that metabonomics is a powerful approach for the quality evaluation of traditional Chinese malera medica.
