14944344959	Study on mode-switching control method of TCSC	The mode-switching control of thyristor controlled series compensation (TCSC) is important to power system stability control and is also one of the key problems of TCSC. On the basis of modeling and simulation, a practicable mode-switching control strategy was proposed. By means of forced synchronization of current in thyristor branch with the line current, the mode switching from capacitive veriner mode or block mode to bypass mode can be implemented. In the switching strategy from capacitive veriner mode or Block mode to inductive veriner mode a method of allowed-section triggering was put forward. To provide synchronization signal of line current for switching control in time, a method to forecast the crossover point of the current was given. Simulation results show that the proposed switching strategy possesses good dynamic performance and can make the mode switching process stationary, fast and is practical.

33746507176	Design of adaptive TCSC damping controller based on oscillation energy analysis	This paper proposes oscillation energy analysis of inter-area mode oscillations for the investigation of inter-area power oscillations and their effective suppression by the design of a TCSC damping controller. The oscillation energy function developed in this paper can interpret inter-area mode oscillations as a continuous process of conversion between oscillation kinetic energy and potential energy. Based on this interpretation, a scheme of consuming oscillation energy has been developed to design the TCSC damping controller to suppress inter-area mode oscillations. The advantage of this proposed control scheme is that no detailed information about data and configuration of the studied power system is required. To implement the control scheme, only active power flow along the tie line where the TCSC is installed is taken as feedback signal of the TCSC damping controller. It is proposed in the paper that in order to enhance the performance of the damping controller, the control gain is adjusted adaptively in real time according to the magnitude of system oscillations. Simulation results with and without the adjusted-gain adaptive TCSC damping controller in a large interconnected power system are presented in the paper to show the effectiveness and robustness of proposed scheme. © 2005 IEEE.

34247279215	Mechanism research on dual impedance solutions of thyristor controlled series compensation	The desired impedance of a TCSC is usually obtained by adjusting the firing angle and it is of great importance to make clear the relationship between the two quantities. Most researches about TCSC dual solution phenomenon focus on the influence of reactor quality factor. The impedance characteristics of a TCSC are studied in the paper, considering the influence of the thyristor conduction characteristics and the equivalent resistance in the reactor branch. Analysis of the phase diagram shows that with thyristor conduction current increasing while reactor quality factor remaining constant, the phase difference decreases between the crossing-zero points of capacitor voltage and line current, which incurs the decrease of thyristor conduction amplitude and width. Further, the thyristor conduction block is pointed out to be the fundamental mechanism of TCSC dual solution phenomenon. Reactor branch current and equivalent quality factor determine the degree of thyristor conduction block. Both amplitude and width of the thyristor conduction current are blocked in the mode synchronized by line current while only amplitude of the thyristor conduction current is blocked synchronized by capacitor voltage. This is why impedance dual solution phenomenon is susceptible to occur in the mode of line current synchronization. The existence of the dual solution phenomenon is demonstrated by both the digital simulation and dynamical emulation experiment.

77954206319	Application of bayesian learning mechanism in power system transient stability assessment	One of the most challenging problems in real-time operation of power system is the prediction of transient stability. Fast and accurate techniques are imperative to achieve on-line transient stability assessment (TSA). This problem has been approached by various machine learning algorithms, however they find a class decision estimate rather than a probabilistic confidence of the class distribution. To counter the shortcoming of common machine learning methods, a novel machine learning technique, i.e. 'relevance vector machine' (RVM), for TSA is presented in this paper. RVM is based on a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, and as a feature it can yield a decision function that depends on only a very fewer number of so-called relevance vectors. The proposed method is tested on New England power system, and compared with a state-of-the-art 'support vector machine' (SVM) classifier. The classification performance is evaluated using false discriminate rate (FDR). It is demonstrated that the RVM classifier can yield a decision function that is much sparser than the SVM classifier while providing higher classification accuracy. Consequently, the RVM classifier greatly reduces the computational complexity, making it more suitable for real-time implementation.

The robustness of traditional PID control during ordering impedance step change is analyzed and the necessity of PID parameter online adjustment is discussed. The relationship between PID parameters and ordering impedance is described based on digital simulation.

For the best control, the close-loop impedance controller of TCSC (Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor) should adopt the nonlinear control theory, but it needs too many data. A variable-structure PID controller based on firing-angle modification is designed. Before the measured impedance reaches or approaches the reference value for the first time, its integral parameter keeps zero, as a PD controller, after that, it changes the integral parameter and recovers the PID controller. The values of error accumulator are similar when TCSC steps from different impedances to a same impedance level to get similar control effectiveness. Simulation and experimental results show that, the proposed control strategy has less overshoot and faster response with good dynamic and static performances.
