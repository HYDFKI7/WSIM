33846332053	Nutrient limitation and wetland botanical diversity in northeast China: Can fertilization influence on species richness?	The effect of fertilization on species richness was investigated in wetland ecosystems in northeast China. Plant nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios (N/P) were used to assess nutrient limitation. A freshwater wetland Carex lasiocarpa community was grown at 12 nutrient treatments (4 N treatments, 4 P treatments, and 4 N + P treatments) and 1 control. Plant nutrient concentrations, soil pH, and species richness were determined after two growing seasons. Fertilization induced changes in plant N/P and soil pH. The marsh wetland plants species richness responded differently to nutrients and soil pH. The relationship between species richness and plant N/P ratios was unimodal. Plant species richness was maximal when the N/P ratio approached 9.5, because availability of nutrient supply was balanced when the plant N/P ratios were close to 9.5. The species richness decreased slightly with N/P < 9.5 and N/P > 9.5. Both N and P availability influenced species richness. P fertilization increased species richness in the N treatment. Species richness increased from 4.3 to 5.6 with P input in the treatment using 4 g m year of N and from 3.3 to 6.0 with increasing P input in the treatment using 40 g m year of N. N fertilization also increased species richness in the P treatment. Species richness increased from 4.3 to 5.6 with increasing N input in the treatment using 1.2 g m year of P and from 4.6 to 6.0 with increasing N input in the treatment using 19.2 g m year of P. However, P input resulted in plant N/P ratio deviation from the optimal value, thus species richness decreased in the wetland. P may be a severe constraint of species richness in the wetland. There was a significantly positive liner relationship between soil pH and species richness. Species have different nutrient requirements and exploit nutrients with varying efficiency, which induce changes of soil pH. By univariate analysis of variance, the unique effect of soil pH accounted for most of the explained variation in species richness. The species richness variance explained jointly by N/P ratios and soil pH was 28.0%. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

Soil TN, TP, effective N and available P contribution rates in both wetlands could reach about 50%. The principle component 1 in Carex lasiocarpa could explain the species relative density of 88% and the aboveground biomass of 84%. The principle component 1 in Deyeuxia angustifolia could explain that the relative density and the aboveground biomass were 75% and 58% respectively.

33645035295	Effects of nutrients and water level fluctuation on wetland plants	Nutrient elements are necessary for the sustainability of environment, while excessive nutrients have potential impacts on the stability of wetland ecosystem, especially on the dynamics of wetland plant communities. The nutrients in wetland habitat decide the growth of its plants, and the dominant species and their richness of plant communities. Accumulation of nutrients has significant effects on the primary productivity, biomass and its allocation, and species diversity of wetland plants. Water is the key factor in wetland system, and the fluctuation of water level affects wetland structure and characteristics. Species composition, species diversity, and plant community succession all show significant responses to moisture content and water level fluctuation in wetland. Nutrients and water level fluctuation are the important factors determining the composition, structure, and function of wetland ecosystem.

34249803836	Niche characteristics of typical marsh wetland plant populations in Sanjiang Plain	Based on field investigation and by using Levins formulae, the niche breadth and niche overlap of dominant plant populations in Sanjiang Plain marsh wetland were studied. The results showed that the niche breadth of test marsh wetland plants decreased in the order of Carex pseudocuraica (0.907) > C. lasiocarpa (0.864) > Glyceria spiculosa (0.855) > Deyeuxia angustifolia (0.500) = Menyanthes trifotiata (0.500) = Naumburgia thyrsiflora (0.500) = Anemone dichotoma (0.500). The niche overlaps among C. lasiocarpa, C. pseudocuraica, M. trifotiata and N. thyrsiflora, and among G. spiculosa, D. angustifolia and A. dichotom were comparatively large, indicating an intense competition among them, while the niche overlap between M. trifotiata and N. thyrsiflora, and D. angustifolia and A. dichotoma was 0, suggesting their different manner of environmental adaptation. Soil water was the dominating environmental factor of wetland plant ecological adaptability. The niche fitness of plant to environment depended on the combined effect of soil water and nutrients. The niche characteristics of marsh wetland plants could better indicate their ecological adaptability and distribution range.

Results showed that total mercury concentrations in water averaged 50.21 ng/L, ranged from 29.74 ng/Lto 136.88 ng/L. Suspended particulate mercury was the dominate phase (53.38% to 85.99%), while soluble mercury accounted for 14.01% to 46.62%. Overall, total mercury and suspended particulate mercury concentrations in water were comparatively higher in the reach from the Baiqi to the Haerbin; however, soluble mercury concentrations were higher in the Haerbin, the Sifangtai, the Songyuan, and the Hadawan reaches. Total mercury concentrations in sediments ranged from 0.013 mg/kg to 1.543 mg/kg, reduced from upstream to downstream. Especially, between the Hadawan and the Songyuan reach in the Secend Songhua River total mercury concentrations in sediments averaged 0.61 mg/kg, which was significantly higher than background of that area, while in mainstream they were parallel to the background.

77954590012	Temporal variability of iron concentrations and fractions in wetland waters in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China	Chemical forms, reactivities and transformation of iron fractions in marshy waters were investigated with cross-flow filtration technique to study the iron environmental behavior. Iron fractions were divided into four parts: acid-labile iron (pre-acidification of unfiltered marshy water samples, > 0.7 μm), high-molecular-weight iron (0.7-0.05 μm), medium-molecular-weight iron (0.05-0.01 μm), and low-molecular-weight iron (< 0.01 μm). The cross-flow filtration suggested that iron primarily exist in both the > 0.7 μm and < 0.01 μm size fractions in marshy waters. Rainfall is the key for rain-fed wetland to determine fate of iron by changing the aquatic biochemical conditions. By monitoring the variation of iron concentrations and fractions over three years, it was found that dissolved iron and acid-labile iron concentrations exhibit a large variation extent under different annual rainfalls from 2006 to 2008. The seasonal variation for iron species proved that the surface temperature could control some conversion reactions of iron in marshy waters. Low-molecular-weight iron would convert to acid-labile iron gradually with temperature decreasing. The photochemical reactions of iron fractions, especially low-molecular-weight iron had occurred under solar irradiation. The relative proportion of low-molecular-weight in total dissolved iron ranging from 28.3% to 43.2% were found during the day time, which proved that the observed decreasing concentration of acid lability iron was caused by its degradation to low molecular weight iron. © 2010 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Concentrations of Hg, Cd, Cu, Zn, Ni and Cr in rice flesh and hulls were determined and risks were assessed based on relative national standards of China. The concentrations of Hg in rice flesh increased with irrigation histories of the paddy fields while no significant relationships were found between the other metal elements and irrigation histories. The heavy metal concentrations in rice flesh and hulls from paddy fields with different irrigation histories took similar orders. The concentrations of Zn in rice flesh were higher than in rice hulls while the concentrations of Cd, Cu, Cr, Hg, and Ni were opposite. Using the monomial pollution index method, only one rice flesh sample was detected with higher Ni than the national standard. The composite pollution indexes of rice flesh ranged from 0.33 to 0.91, with the average of 0.51, which was considered to be in the level of security. The results show that the historical pollution of the Second Songhua River resulted in the bioaccumulation of Hg in rice flesh, but it has not posed ecological risks. Consequently, after the Hadashan Reservoir depending on the Second Songhua River as water source is built, the irrigation will pose low ecological risks to the food security in this area.

79952679744	Dew condensation rules in farmland ecosystem in Sanjiang plain	As a significant part of water balance, dew has attracted great interest and has been extensively studied. Dew is a crucial input for water balance and nutrients cycling of farmland ecosystem. Dew could play important role in spaying leaf fertilizers in paddy and drought-resisting and preventing the disease and pest in rain fed land. In this study, a series of parameters about dew characterization including Dew Days, Dew Frequency, Dew Intensity and Dewfall were defined comparing to parameters describing the precipitation. Based on these parameters dew condensation was measured in a farmland in Sanjiang Plain. In order to discuss the condensation law of dew, Dew Intensity was monitored in situ on stem and leaf of plant in paddy, soybean and corn fields during the growing season form early of June to late September in 2008 and 2009. The experiment was organized at the Sanjiang Mire Wetland Experimental Station (47°35'N, 133°31'E), Chinese Academy of Sciences, located in Tongjiang, Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China. Dew was collected by wood sticks made with poplar tree. The collector was daily weighted at sunset and sunrise with an electronic balance (accuracy is within 0. 001 g). For each experiment, the collectors were set on the bottom (5 cm above the surface level) and canopy of the plant, respectively. The results indicated that dew occurred about 70 days in a year and Dew Days accounted about 70% non-rain nights in the farmland. The maximum Dew Intensity occurred in July and August. Statistical analyses were carried out to compare the Dew Intensity. Analysis of variance of Dew Intensity was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the significance was set at P <0. 05. The Dew Intensity in 2009 was significantly larger (P < 0. 05) than that in 2008 because the rainfall in 2009 was much more abundant than that in 2008. The Dew Intensity on paddy and soybean plants were almost equivalent, but the Dew Intensity on corn plant was significantly (P <0. 05) lower than those on paddy and soybean plants. The vertical condensation laws of dew on various plants were similar. The Dew Intensity was maximum at the canopy, the second was at the height that was 50 cm over the canopy, and the minimum occurred at the ground level. Dew plays an important role in the water balance of farmland ecosystem. The factual Dewfall in unit field area was calculated by the factors of leaf area index (LAI), Dew Days and Dew Intensity. The annual Dewfall showed a distinct variety of the amount between paddy and rainfed land. The annual dewfall in rainfed land ranged from 10 mm to 15 mm. In the paddy Dewfall was about two to three times larger. The Dewfall increases rapidly when rainfed land reclaimed into paddy. LAI was the determining factor that affected the annual dewfall. Otherwise, the formula for calculating Dewfall offered a reliable way to analyze dewfall data in farmland ecosystem. Most importantly, dew parameters, which were defined for the first time, provide a more precise way to describe and study dew.

Results of correlative analysis showed that Hg was positively related to Fe, Mn and organic matter. When eliminated Fe and Mn, Fe and organic matter, Mn and organic matter, respectively, results of the partial correlative analysis showed that Hg was still positively related to Fe. However, the correlations of Hg and other components disappeared. The results of variance analysis showed high contribution ratio (85.1%) of Fe to squared deviation of Hg.

The highest dew amounts in Carex lasiocarpa marsh were 0.201 mm/d, and the most frequent dew volume ranged from 0.08 mm/d to 0.14 mm/d. The amounts correlated positively with relative humidity, dew point temperature, and water vapor pressure. Whereas it correlated negatively with wind speed.

Overall, the research on NPS pollution in Northeast China had an increasing trend, and the research contents included investigation and assess-ment, quantification of pollution load, mechanisms of pollutants translocation, modeling simulation, and prevention and control. The research interests were nitrogen, phosphorus, sediments, pesti-cides, and heavy metals. Empirical methods rather than mechanism models were more used to estimate the pollution load, and the researches were more on agricultural rather than urban NPS pollu-tion. The control and management of NPS pollution was remained in soil and water conservation, and lacked of optimal collection assessment for soil and water conservation measures and of assess-ment for optimal management methods. At present, the research was overall at the stage of theoreti-cal exploration, and controversy remained whether the nonpoint source was major source or not. In-coming researches should focus on the measure application, assessment, basic data collection, de-termination of regional NPS pollutants, quantification of pollution load, and invention of new tech-nologies ; and multi-disciplinary corporation should be strengthened to supply scientific bases for re-gional water environmental control and prevention.

The results showed that bioturbation to sediment suspension would promote the release of Pb and Cd on the sediments. Pb and Cd derived from sediments were adsorbed on the suspending particulates, but not enriched in the worms. The contents of Pb in worms were markedly increased with exposure time when Pb was added into overlying water, mainly ascribed to the metabolic way of worms. Higher concentrations of Pb were oberserved only on the surface of sediments in the treatment without worms but in different depths with worms. Bioturbation not only increased significantly concentrations of Pb and Cd in waters, but promoted the diffusion from overlying waters to deeper parts of sediments.

This study, based on the discussion about the type, functions and services of wetlands in Honghe National Nature Reserve, defines the components for eco-environmental water requirement and calculates the total eco-environmental water requirement for wetland ecosystem. The component for water requirement includes static water requirement and dynamic water requirement. The former refers to the water quantity required from the current surface level to the ideal surface water level, while the later includes water requirements for the plants, wildlife, recharge for groundwater and soil, respectively. The results indicate that the minimum water requirement is 16362.36x104m3 and the optimal water requirement is 25329.14x104m3, while the maximum requirement is 32115.70x104m3.

Results show that the contents of heavy metals in fishes were found in the order of Zn > Pb > Cu > Hg > Cd. Little difference was observed between fishes from the Second Songhua River and the main stream of Songhua River in Cu and Zn concentrations, and the Pb and Hg concentrations found in the Second Songhua River were higher than that in the main stream of Songhua River, however, higher concentrations of Cd were found in the main stream of Songhua River. The concentrations in fishes varied sharply among species. All the metals in carnivorous fish except Zn were higher than those in omnivorous and herbivorous species. At present, the concentrations of Cu, Zn, Hg and Cd in fishes from Songhua River are relatively low, and the pollution is much lighter in 2006 than in the 1990s. However, the pollution of Pb is still aggravating steadily. As a result of the high concentration of Pb, the fishes from Songhua River are still quite high in integrated heavy metal pollution, especially the fishes from the Second Songhua River, which has already reached the level of heavy pollution.

78049426093	Effects of particle-sizes, pH and organic matter on adsorption and desorption of mercury to sediments in the Songhua River	The present study aims to further reveal the environmental behavior of mercury on sediments surface. Effects of particle-sizes, pH and concentrations of dissolved organic matter(DOM) on mercury adsorption and desorption to the surface of sediments in the Songhua River were investigated by simulation experiments. A distinct variety of absorption ability among sediments with different particle-sizes was observed. Under this experimental condition, the absorption ability increased inversely with particle-size of sediments. In all absorption systems, mercury adsorption was enhanced when pH increased from 3.5 to 4.5, while mercury adsorption was inhibited significantly with the increasing of pH when pH values were above 4.5. With the increasing of pH values, the desorption of mercury presented a decreasing-increasing trend, the minimum desorption occurred at pH 5. Citric acid inhibited the mercury adsorption, and the intensity was correlated with mercury concentrations. Effects of citric acid on desorption of mercury were also apparently. With the increasing of citric acid concentrations, its effect on desorption presented a trend as enhanced-inhibited-steadied. Therefore, the above factors affected the mercury adsorption and desorption obviously, and it was necessary to take these factors into consideration in conducting the rivers' mercury control and dealing with a sudden pollution incident.

78649796082	Export of phosphorus from paddy field and its transport process in Sanjiang Plain	As the largest concentrative distribution area for freshwater marshes in China, Sanjiang Plain is of great ecological value for its function of regulating climate, preserving water sources, and protecting biodiversity, etc. Meanwhile, it is one of the main grain - producing areas in China which supplies a significant amount of grain. In order to increase the grain production, paddy field became a major land use type in Sanjiang Plain in recent years, which may lead to adverse effects for water and wetland system because of the nonpoint source pollutants export. Thus, researches on the mechanism of nonpoint source pollution in paddy field are urgent and important for protecting the wetland system and preventing water quality degradation. This study aimed to discuss the export mechanism of phosphorus from paddy field in Sanjiang Plain. Different scales of in - situ experiments were performed to study the concentrations of phosphorus, the intercepting ratio of bund to phosphorus, the lateral seepage velocity during the export process, and to quantify the annual export load of phosphorus. Furthermore, the transport process of phosphorus in drainage systems was also discussed. The artificial drainage, surface runoff and lateral seepage through bund are the three ways of phosphorus export. In the study, the water quantity of artificial drainage and surface runoff was estimated by the summation of each drainage process or runoff event, and the water quality was calculated by the weighted average concentration of phosphorus; the quantity of lateral seepage was calculated by the change of water level, the rainfall and evaporation date according to water - balance of a trench near the paddy field, the quality of lateral seepage water was determined by the weighted average of phosphorus in seepage water sampled from different soil depths. The 102 water samples were sampled from the trench - drain - marshy river - river system before and after the two artificial drainage ( in May and August) events so as to test the natural purification ability of the system. The results showed that the near - trench bund played an important role in intercepting the total phosphorus and the dissolved total phosphorus, the maximum intercepting ratio of bund to total phosphorus and the dissolved total phosphorus reached about 90% and 80% , respectively. The mean intercepting ratio reached about 50%-60% , and with the increasing of the width of bund, the intercepting ability increased.

The total mercury contents in hair samples were determined and the influencing factors were analyzed. The results showed that the range of the total mercury contents was 0.15-1.01 mg/kg and the average value was 0.56 mg/kg. The average hair mercury content of male residents was 0.55 mg/kg while that of female residents was 0.60 mg/kg. The total hair mercury firstly increased and then gradually decreased with the increasing of age. The lowest mean hair mercury value (0.47 mg/kg) was detected in the residents with the age of 0-20 and the highest mean hair mercury value (0.73 mg/kg) was detected in the residents with the age of 40-50. Among the other factors influencing human hair mercury contents, the gender, height, body weight, fish consumption, smoking and wine-drinking showed no significant correlations with the hair mercury contents. Only one hair sample was detected with greater mercury content than the limitation (1.00 mg/kg) established by USEPA, suggesting low mercury exposure risks in the area. This investigation indicated the historical pollution of the Second Songhua River hadn't lead health risks to the residents of the region and the irrigation using water from the river after the building of the Hadashan Reservoir would cause low environmental risks.

Different scales of in-situ experiments were performed to study the concentrations of nitrogen, the intercepting ratio of bund to nitrogen, and the lateral seepage velocity during the export process of nitrogen in the field-bund-trench system. The annual export load of nitrogen was also quantified. The results showed that the width of near-trench bund affected the lateral seepage velocity and the intercepting ability of bund to nitrogen obviously. With the increasing of the width, the velocity decreased, however, the intercepting ability increased. The intercepting ratio of bund to ammonia nitrogen was bigger than that of total nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen. In order to control the nitrogen loss, the width of near-trench bund and the depth of trench were suggested to be at 80-130 cm and 150 cm, respectively.

This study aims to set up a series of parameters about dew characterization, to build the system of monitoring dewfall and make a model of predicting dew in mire wetland ecosystem. The experiment was in situ carried out during the growing season from mid-May through mid-October in a mire wetland where Carex lasiocarpa is the dominant plant. Dew was measured by using four different kinds of collectors which were glass, poplar woodstick, sunflower stick and filter paper, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that, compared to other collectors, poplar woodstick was the optimal collector for dew measurement considering the ideal surface idiosyncrasy and its convenience for material and operation. Dew began to condense from one and a half hour after sunset and Dew Intensity reached the peak at about half an hour before sunrise. The factual Dewfall in unit field area was calculated by the factors of leaf area index, Dew Days, Dew Intensity, etc. Based on the synchronous meteorological factors, a stepwise linearmulti-variation regression model was established to predict Dew Intensity. Furthermore, the model successfully interpreted the relationship between simulated and measured Dew Intensity. This method which used poplar woodstick, as well as the formula for calculating Dewfall offered a reliable way to analyze dewfall datas in wetland ecosystem, and most importantly, the parameters of dew, which were defined for the first time, provide a more precise way to describe and study dew. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Surface area of Mn oxides was larger than Fe oixdes and humic acid, and all of them increased on different degrees after combined with microorganisms. But surface areas of three materials were not direct proportion to the adsorption capacities of Pb and Cd, which were mainly atributed to different adsorption mechanisms of heavy metals on them.

79955071802	Effects of land use and changes in cover on the transformation and transportation of iron: A case study of the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China	Wetland reclamation has been ongoing in the Sanjiang Plain since the mid-1950s, which has resulted in major changes in wetlands and the agriculture ecosystem in the region that have influenced the iron output to the Sea of Okhotsk and limited the primary productivity in the North Pacific Ocean. This study was conducted to investigate the chemical forms of iron in different aquatic environments (agricultural water including groundwater, paddy water, and canal water; wetland water including marsh water, marsh streams, and main streams) with the cross-flow filtration method to reveal the transportation and transformation characteristics of iron in response to major land use changes. In addition, the factors affecting iron behavior in different water bodies were reviewed. In marsh water and streams, the concentrations of dissolved iron were higher due to the high organic matter contents and marsh water becoming the main iron source for river water. The conversion of dissolved iron into acid-labile iron occurred during the discharge of wetland water into marsh rivers. Iron primarily existed in both the >0.7 and <0.01 μm size fractions, accounting for about 58.3% and 26.4% of the total dissolved iron, respectively. In agricultural irrigation systems, ferrous ion entered the paddy fields from groundwater, and a fraction of this ferrous iron was subsequently converted into high molecular weight and medium molecular weight iron (colloid iron) in paddy and canal water. However, the concentrations of total dissolved iron decreased by 62.5% from underground to the surface due to the formation of precipitates. Despite this, water discharge in agriculture is still an important iron source for rivers and has the potential to supplement iron due to its higher acid-labile iron concentrations. Land use and cover change and agricultural irrigation increased the iron content of surface soil, but reduced the output of iron in water systems. Overall, the concentration of total dissolved iron in water systems has been reduced to 42.6% by wetland reclamation. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79955553529	The effect of two wetland plants on nitrogen and phosphorus removal from the simulated paddy field runoff in two small-scale subsurface flow constructed wetlands	In order to explore the approaches of ecological engineering for a non-point source pollution caused by paddy field runoff in the Sanjiang Plain, and to seek suitable wetland plants which are appropriate to be used under the local natural conditions in constructed wetlands two subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSFCWs), 2.0 m in length, 0.5 m in width and 0.65 m in depth, were set up by selecting the local soil and slag (3-5 mm in diameter) as the substrates and transplanting two typical natural marsh wetland plants, Calamagrostis angustifolia and Phragmites australis. The wetlands were dosed in batch operations using synthetic wastewater without the addition of any organic carbon but with the addition of ammonium-N (30.32 mg/L), nitrate-N (28.74 mg/L) and phosphate-P (10.15 mg/L) as major pollutants. The results suggested that both of the two plant species maintained normal growth in the wastewater, which demonstrates their good pollutant resistance.

79958778386	Application of time-series model to predict groundwater dynamic in Sanjiang Plain, northeast China	To study the groundwater dynamic in the typical region of Sanjiang Plain, long-term groundwater level observation data in the Honghe State Farm were collected and analyzed in this paper. The seasonal and long-term groundwater dynamic was explored. From 1996 to 2008, groundwater level kept declining due to intensive exploitation of groundwater resources for rice irrigation. A decline of nearly 5 m was found for almost all the monitoring wells. A time-series method was established to model the groundwater dynamic. Modeled results by time-series model showed that the groundwater level in this region would keep declining according to the current exploitation intensity. A total dropdown of 1.07 m would occur from 2009 to 2012. Time-series model can be used to model and forecast the groundwater dynamic with high accuracy. Measures including control on groundwater exploitation amount and application of water saving irrigation technique should be taken to prevent the continuing declining of groundwater in the Sanjiang Plain.

79958784390	Metal concentrations of dew collected from Carex lasiocarpa in sanjiang plain	Particles and gases are removed from the atmosphere by wet deposition (rain, fog and dew) and dry deposition. The wet deposition process is a major pathway of acidic pollutants from the atmosphere to the biosphere. Dew has attracted great interest and has been extensively studied on its amount. The chemistry of dew has received little attention. In order to discuss the dew ecology efficiency and reveal the air status of surface layer in the Sanjiang Plain, pH and the concentrations of 26 types of metal elements such as K, Na, Ca, Mg were monitored and analyzed. The experiment was organized in the Sanjiang Mire Wetland Experimental Station (47°35' N, 133°31' E), Chinese Academy of Sciences, located in Tongjiang, Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China. Carex lasiocarpa is the dominant plant, and it is selected as the typical experiment plot. Carex lasiocarpa dew was collected form mid July to mid September in 2008 and late May to early September in 2009. The results showed that the mean pH of Carex lasiocarpa dew was (6.42 ±0.23) and the acid dew never occurred in the research area. Therefore, dew can not damage protective surfaces on leaves, interfere with guard cells and poison plant cells from the aspect of pH. The types of metal element in Carex lasiocarpa dew were abundant. K, Mg, Ca are the nutrient elements and Mn, Cu, Cr, Zn, Na, Mo, V, As, Fe, Ni are the trace elements. They were all can be monitored in Carex lasiocarpa dew. The mean concentrations of Cd, Be, Co, Se, Mo, Th, U and Tl were below 1.0 μg/L. The mean concentrations of Pb, As, Ni, Cr, V, Ag, Cu and Zn were between 1.0 μg/L and 100 μg/L. The mean concentrations of Na, Al, Fe and Ba were between 100 μg/L and 1000 μg/L. The mean concentrations of K, Mg, Ca and Mn were higher than 1 000 μg/L. Carex lasiocarpa dew can provide nutrient elements and trace elements to plant. The metal elements in Carex lasiocarpa surface water and dry deposition were the main sources of metal in dew. The contents of K, Ca, Na, Mg, Mn, Fe, Zn in Carex lasiocarpa dew were higher than those in rain obviously and it demonstrated that dew can offer more nutrient elements than rain. This phenomenon attributed to the evaporation effect on dew samples as it was exposed to longer time than rain. Dew can reveal the air pollution status and it is significant to monitor the chemistry character of dew. The trace amount of Pb, Ba, Se, As, Co, Cr, Cu in Carex lasiocarpa dew implied that there is no automobile exhaust, coal combustion or industrial pollution in this area. Dew formation is a local phenomenon, significantly influenced by microclimatic ambiance, land profile, and favorable meteorological conditions. Analyzing chemistry character of dew is a simple and useful method to reveal the status of surface layer. This method can provide the assessment of air pollution and judge the quality of air. Formation of acidic dew is critical to assess corrosion process. Consequently, dew should pay much more attention to collect and analyze.

79960712388	Assessment of hydrological regime alteration in the Naoli River since the 1950s	The temporal variability of daily runoff from 1956 to 2005 in Baoqing station, which is located in the upper reaches of Naoli River, had been analyzed in the present study. The Mann-Kendall statistical test was applied to assess the changes of the hydrological features in the station and the jump of trends was 1966. Therefore, the runoff records of Baoqing station was divided into two stages namely the period of more natural or less altered flow conditions (1956-1966) and the period of more altered conditions (1967-2005). Then, the Rang of Variability Approach (RVA) proposed by Richer was used to analyze the hydrological situation changes in the upper watershed of Naoli River. The results showed that the human events have tremendously changed the hydrological regime of the upstream of Naoli River and the ecological environment has been destructed to a certain extent. In the future, the mankind's activities in the watershed should be decreased opportunely. © 2011 IEEE.

82255192102	Risk assessment for methylmercury in fish from the Songhua River, China: 30 years after mercury-containing wastewater outfalls were eliminated	This study aims to investigate the methylmercury contamination of fish from the Songhua River, China. A total of 328 fish representing various trophic levels were captured from ten reaches of the river and determined for methylmercury by gas chromatography method. Total mercury in fish, water and sediments from three typical reaches were analyzed simultaneously. Methylmercury concentrations in fish from the Second Songhua River and the mainstream of the Songhua River were 0.024 ± 0.016 and 0.015 ± 0.007 mg/kg fresh weight, respectively. The proportion of methylmercury to total mercury ranged from 21.8% to 69.7%, with the mean value of 42.6%. The observed methylmercury concentrations were much lower than the historical values and were generally within the reported literature range, and health hazard assessment showed no health risk from exposure to methylmercury by consuming fish from this river, demonstrating that mercury contamination of the Songhua River has been effectively controlled by nearly 30 years of environmental governance and natural purification. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84864046694	Dewfall variation by large-scale reclamation in Sanjiang Plain	Over the past decades, the area of the cultivated land in Sanjiang Plain has increased at the cost of wetland shrinkage. In order to reveal the change in dewfall brought about by large-scale wetland reclamation, dew was monitored by woodstick made from poplar tree, and the annual factual dewfall per unit area was calculated by the leaf area index (LAI) in wetland, soybean land, paddy land, and residential land from May to October 2010 in Sanjiang Plain. The results showed that dewfall levels in wetland, soybean land, paddy land, and residential land were (11.12, 11.98, 30.18, and 4.25) mm, respectively. When wetland changed into soybean land, dewfall did not have significant variation. While, when soybean land was reclaimed into paddy land, dewfall increased to about twice the initial value. Dewfall in the residential land was the least, accounting for only about 1/7 of that in the paddy. LAI was the main factor that affected dewfall in different ecosystems. Relative humidity and air temperature were the main factors that affected dew formation. Monitoring of the dew intensity can reveal wetland adjustments in the local space microclimate and determine how changes in land-use and landcover by humans transform the water cycle. © Society of Wetland Scientists 2012.

84871538786	Snowmelt runoff: A new focus of urban nonpoint source pollution	Irregular precipitation associated with global climate change had been causing various problems in urban regions. Besides the runoff due to rainfall in summer, the snowmelt runoff in early spring could also play an important role in deteriorating the water quality of the receiving waters. Due to global climate change, the snowfall has increased gradually in individual regions, and snowstorms occur more frequently, which leads to an enhancement of snowmelt runoff flow during the melting seasons. What is more, rivers just awaking from freezing cosntitute a frail ecosystem, with poor self-purification capacity, however, the urban snowmelt runoff could carry diverse pollutants accumulated during the winter, such as coal and/or gas combustion products, snowmelting agents, automotive exhaust and so on, which seriously threaten the receiving water quality. Nevertheless, most of the research focused on the rainfall runoff in rainy seasons, and the study on snowmelt runoff is still a neglected field in many countries and regions. In conclusion, due to the considerable water quantity and the worrisome water quality, snowmelt runoff in urban regions with large impervious surface areas should be listed among the important targets in urban nonpoint source pollution management and control. © 2012 by the authors.

84874076891	Fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matter during composting at low carbon/nitrogen ratios	We investigated the composting of swine manure at low carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios (about 13). The purpose was to elucidate organic matter transformation during composting by means of chemical and spectral methods. Swine manure was composted with two bulking agents (rice straw and leaves) at a ratio of 2:1 (manure:bulking agent; v:v) respectively. Low initial C/N ratios (about 13) did not prevent the swine manure from composting, which would greatly decrease the usage of bulking agent. A high organic matter mineralization rate was observed in the co-composting of straw and manure paired with a high maximum temperature and long thermophilic phase. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra were also used to monitor the component changes in the dissolved organic matter. Fluorescence parameters, including peak location, peak intensity, the ratio of peak intensity and fluorescence regional integration, were displayed and discussed as the maturity index. The fluorescence regional integration, showing higher correlation coefficient than the fluorescence intensity peaks, could be used as a valuable tool for assessing compost maturity. © 2013 The Author(s).

84875646800	The distribution and output of dissolved carbon in typical rivers of Sanjiang Plain, China	Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rivers plays an important link from terrestrial to marine environments in the global carbon cycle. The Sanjiang Plain, a floodplain encompassing many freshwater wetlands, had been suffering from extensive buildings of drainage ditches and addition of chemical fertilizers in the past 60 years. The distribution of DOC in typical rivers (divided into main and marshy rivers) of Sanjiang Plain from 2006 to 2008 was studied. Marshy rivers including Bielahong River, Naoli River, and Yalv River (mean concentration, 9.03 mg/L) showed higher DOC levels than main rivers (mean concentration, 6.63 mg/L) including Amur River, Ussuri River, and Songhua River. It was estimated that about 1.54 million tons of DOC from Amur River were brought into Okhotsk Sea annually. The geographical or seasonal variation between main and marshy rivers has also proven that the farming activity could increase DOC output, and the risk that increasing DOC concentration in growing season potentially increase the pollutant mobility and toxicity should be paid more attention. © by PSP.

This study aims to investigate the dewfall in the Carex lasiocarpa marsh in the Sanjiang Plain. The experiment was performed during the growing season from mid-May to mid-October in 2008 and 2009. Dew formation was monitored using wood sticks. The results indicate that dew events occurred during 70% to 80% of the rainless nights during the research period. The dew intensity reached its peak in August in both years. A statistics analysis shows that the dew intensity in July and September of 2009 was significantly lower than that in 2008 because of the significantly higher relative humidity during that year. However, the annual dewfall was almost the same, at the amount of 8.76 and 8.38 mm in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The Carex lasiocarpa marsh is an important site for dew deposition. © by PSP.

Meanwhile, the experimental data were fitted by the Langmuir isothermal adsorption equation. The maximum ammonium nitrogen adsorption amounts for slag, 70% slag with 30% ditch sediment, and ditch sediments were 0.49, 1.03 and 1.75 mg/g, respectively; the maximum phosphate adsorption amounts were 0.99, 2.33 and 1.88 mg/g, respectively; the adsorption rates of ammonium nitrogen were 0.10, 0.11 and 0.54 mg/(g·h) during 0~4 h; the adsorption rates of phosphate were 0.048, 0.051, 0.096 mg/(g·h) during 0~2 h. Slag was used as matrix dam fill since ditch sediments were loose and easy to run off. The hydraulic retention time of ditch water in drainage ditches was extended with matrix dams as well as mitigating the flow velocity of ditch water.

84880634376	Nitrogen loss through lateral seepage from paddy fields: A case study in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China	This paper provides details of a study to track the lateral seepage of nitrogen through the bunds of a paddy field in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. Field simulation experiments were conducted during the rice growing season in 2010 at the experimental plots of the Sanjiang Mire Wetland Experimental Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Measurements revealed that the lateral seepage rates were significantly affected by the irrigation water amount. Once the lateral seepage began, its rate increased with the increasing water level in the paddy field. The concentrations of nitrogen in lateral seepage from the bund showed good responsiveness to the nitrogen application rates and the fertilization time in the paddy field. The nitrogen concentrations increased with increasing urea application rates, and these concentrations decreased sharply within the first few days (10~15 d) after fertilization, and then presented a stable trend, suggesting that the first few days (10~15 d) after fertilization were critical period for pollution control. The bund could intercept some of the nitrogen in seepage water, and it presented higher interception ability to total nitrogen (N

The correlation between metals in hair and the subject descriptors (i.e., age, gender, height, weight, smoking, and drinking habits) was determined, and the metals' contents in the commonly consumed foods and the local environment were also analyzed. The mean concentrations of Pb, Zn, and Cu in residents' scalp hair were 85.9 ± 51.1, 174.0 ± 31.1, and 6.7 ± 4.4 μg/g, respectively. Drinking habits influenced Pb contents significantly; the highest Pb concentrations were found in hair of residents who drink frequently, followed by those who drink occasionally and those who never drink. However, for Zn and Cu, no significant influence was found. There was no significant correlation between metal contents and age, gender, or smoking habits (p >.05). However, a significant positive correlation (p <.01) was observed between Zn contents in hair and height. In general, the concentrations of metals in most of the food and the local environments meet China's or other standards.

84901930679	Speciation of Cu and Zn during composting of pig manure amended with rock phosphate	Pig manure usually contains a large amount of metals, especially Cu and Zn, which may limit its land application. Rock phosphate has been shown to be effective for immobilizing toxic metals in toxic metals contaminated soils. The aim of this study work was to investigate the effect of rock phosphate on the speciation of Cu and Zn during co-composting of pig manure with rice straw. The results showed that composting process and rock phosphate addition significantly affected the changes of metal species. During co-composting, the exchangeable and reducible fractions of Cu were transformed to organic and residue fractions, thus the bioavailable Cu fractions were decreased. The rock phosphate addition enhanced the metal transformation depending on the level of rock phosphate amendment. Zinc was found in the exchangeable and reducible fractions in the compost. The bioavailable Zn fraction changed a little during the composting process. The composting process converted the exchangeable Zn fraction into reducible fraction. Addition of an appropriate amount (5.0%) of rock phosphate could advance the conversion. Rock phosphate could reduce metal availability through adsorption and complexation of the metal ions on inorganic components. The increase in pH and organic matter degradation could be responsible for the reduction in exchangeable and bioavailable Cu fractions and exchangeable Zn fraction in rock phosphate amended compost. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

By Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurement and XRD measurement, it was confirmed that the HVMT was more suitable as filler than VMT. By considering the influence of pH, temperature, adsorption composite content and initial mass concentration on removal rate and adsorption capacity, it can be concluded that the removal rate increased first and then decreased with the increasing pH. "Room temperature" was the optimum temperature for the composite. The removal rate of AN increased with the increasing adsorption composite content. When the adsorption reached equilibrium, the removal rate remained unchanged; the adsorption capacity of AN increased with increasing initial concentration. The removal rate increased gradually with lower initial concentration of AN. When the initial concentration increased to a certain level, the removal rate started to decline. When the initial concentration and composite content showed adsorption equilibrium, the adsorption capacity remained unchanged. The composite can be recycled to be reused after regeneration for nine cycles; the AN adsorption capacity of composite was decreased by only 4.5 %. If the composite can be prepared in large-scale production lines, the costs of HVMT/PC/ EPDM porous composite can be controlled at less than USD 16/kg. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

84920265910	Summary of the paleodrainage pattern changes in the Northeast China Plain and its neighboring areas	The evolutions of Quaternary drainage pattern in the Northeast China Plain are discussed in the paper. According to analytical results of core samples, we found that during Paleogene and Neogene periods there was a large paleolake in Dalianhe-Xiangshun region that deposited more than 700 m of lacustrine-aluvial coal-bearing fragmental rocks, and proved that the upper Songhua River and the Mudan River flowed into the large paleolake at that time. Because of the rising of Yitong- Yilan rift, the lower Songhua River eroded headwards and captured upper Songhua River and Mudan River; for this reason, we believe, that the Songhua River and Mudan River had never been able to flow westwards to the Songnen Plain. The capture river systems of the Songhua River and Heilong River were formed between the end of Pliocene and beginning of the Early Pleistocene. After that period, another large paleolake was formed in the western Northeast China Plain during the Early and Middle Pleistocene, thus the surrounding rivers to flow into the paleolake to form a centripetal drainage.

84921069427	The effect of reclamation on the distribution of heavy metals in saline–sodic soil of Songnen Plain, China	The spatial distribution of total concentrations and the chemical speciation of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb and Hg) in saline–sodic soil at different periods of time since reclamation (rain-fed arable land converted into paddy field) were investigated. The fluxes of different input sources of heavy metals were also analyzed. The results showed that long-term reclamation caused a decrease in soil pH and significant Hg accumulation in saline–sodic surface soil. Increasing Hg concentrations were identified at sites that had been reclaimed for longer periods, especially because the Songhua River was polluted by Hg between the 1960s and 1982; therefore, irrigation was assumed to be the predominant contributor of Hg accumulation in soil. Sequential leaching experiment revealed that a greater proportion of Hg occurred in the residual fraction, while the Cu, Zn and Pb were easily bound to oxidizable fraction in saline–sodic soil. Assessed by the spatial distribution of heavy metal concentrations in reclaimed soil, reclamation of saline–sodic soil in the Songnen Plain appeared to decrease the mobility of heavy metals, and did not pose the risk of accumulation in soil.
