33645949424	Microstructures evolution of 3003 aluminium alloy foil during preparing process	The microstructures evolution of 3003 aluminum alloy foil during preparing process was investigated by hardness and electric resistance test, XRD analysis, OM, SEM and TEM observation. The effects of Fe and Si tramp elements on the microstructures and properties of 3003 alloy were also discussed. The results show that the solid solution of Mn decreases, and the α-Al(Fe, Mn)Si phases increase with increasing the (Fe + Si) content. A large amount of manganiferous particles precipitate during annealing at 300°C and 500°C after cold-rolled deformation. At 300°C, the precipitates are affected by the cold reduction. However, the precipitation is independent of the cold-rolled deformation at 500°C. Moreover, a large amount of fine and uniformly distributed second phase particles are observed in 3003 aluminum alloy foils with higher Fe/Si ratio.

33646171906	Precipitation and recrystallization of AA3003 aluminium alloy during annealing	The interaction of recrystallization and precipitation of AA3003 aluminum alloy during annealing as well as its effect on the microstructures of alloys were investigated by means of hardness, electrical resistivity measurements and optical microscopy. The results show that a large number of precipitates occur during annealing at 300°C and 500°C. Annealing at 300°C, the precipitates are nucleated preferentially at lattice defects, such as dislocations and sub-boundaries, higher cold reduction results in a larger number of precipitates. Annealing at 300°C, the precipitation occurs prior to recrystallization, and the grains become coarse. However, annealing at 500°C, the recrystallization happens prior to precipitation, the precipitation is independent of the cold deformation reduction and a fine, equiaxed grain structure is obtained.

33745647302	Evolution of grain structure in AA2195 Al-Li alloy plate during recrystallization	The evolution of the grain structures in AA2195 Al-Li alloy plate warm-rolled by 80% reduction during recrystallization annealing at 500°C was investigated by electron backscatter diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. It is found that the elongated grain structures are caused by the lamellar distribution of recrystallization nucleation sites, being lack of large second phase particles (> 1 μm), and dispersive coherent particles (such as δ′ and β′) concentrated in planar bands. The recrystallization process may be separated into three stages: firstly, recrystallization nucleation occurs heterogeneously, and the nuclei are concentrated in some planar zones parallel to rolling plane. Secondly, the grain boundaries interacted with small particles concentrate in planar bands, which is able to result in the elongated grain structures. The rate of the grain growth is controlled by the dissolution of these small particles. Thirdly, after most of small particles are dissolved, their hindrance to migiation of the grain boundaries fades away, and the imrecrystallized zones are consumed by adjacent recrystallized grains. The migration of high angle grain boundaries along normal direction leads a gradual transformation from the elongated grains to the nearly equiaxed, which is driven by the tension of the grain boundaries.

33747824442	Effects of solution heat treatment on microstructure in a high-purity 7055 aluminum alloy	Optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to investigate the effects of solution heat treatment on microstructure of a high-purity 7055 aluminum alloy. The AlZnMgCu phase dissolves slowly during solution heat treatment while AlZnMgCuFeTi phase does not dissolve. Higher solution temperature and longer solution time led to more dissolution of AIZnMgCu phase but larger fraction of recrystallization and coarse grain size. Over-heated structure is formed for solution treatment at 490°C. Compared with single solutioning, duplex solutioning results in more dissolution of AIZnMgCu phase without much increase of recrystallization fraction and grain size.

33845577939	Quench sensitivity of 7055 aluminum alloy	The quench sensitivity of 7055 aluminum alloy was studied with time-temperature-hardness curve evaluated via interrupted quenching and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the critical temperature range is 235-415°C with the nose temperature of 355°C. Fast decomposition of the supersaturated solid solution held at 355°C is observed and large η phase is primarily formed on dispersoids, which leads to the loss of solutes and decrease of aging hardening effect. The optimum quenching condition for the alloy is as follows: rapid cooling in the critical temperature range of 235-415°C and slower cooling in the high temperature range, which can lead to high mechanical properties and low residual stress can be obtained.

33947195907	Micromechanical model for competition between intergranular and intragranular fracture in 7XXX aluminum alloys	The 7XXX aluminum alloys having a microstructure with precipitate free zones (PFZ) nearby the grain boundary, have received a great deal of attention due to their high strength, light mass, and yet poor fracture toughness. Experimental investigation into the effect of microstructure on the ductility was well established and comprehensive in the literature. A micromechanical model using a unit cell including some voids and relevant microstructural features was created. The competition between intergranular and intragranular fracture was investigated by comparing the void growth velocity between PFZ and matrix. The effects of void aspect ratio, relative PFZ volume, orientation of PFZ on the ductility of 7XXX aluminum alloys were analyzed. The results show that the model can explain the effect of microstructure on the competition between intergranular and intragranular fracture.

33847326897	Method for predicting effective mechanical properties of dual phase steels	Based on the asymptotic homogenization theory, the periodic boundary conditions for the unit cell were established by using the ANSYS parametric design language. The problem of the unit cell was solved by finite element method and the effective elasto-plastic properties of dual phase steels were obtained. The calculated results show that the effective mechanical properties of the dual phase steel can be well simulated by the asymptotic homogenization method, for the dual phase steels with martensite volume fraction less than 13%, the results predicted with the three plane strain models are quite similar. With martensite volume fraction increasing, the results for the three models are different, and the unit cell of square array can well predict the effective properties of dual phase steels with higher martensite volume fraction.

33847405864	TTP curve of 7055 aluminum alloy and its application	The temperature-time-property (TTP) curve of 7055 aluminum alloy was evaluated by interrupted quenching method. The results show that the critical temperature range is 210-420°C with the nose temperature of about 355°C. Combined with measured cooling curves, the TTP curve was used to predict the influence of quenching rate on the hardness of 7055 aluminum alloy by quench factor analysis method. And the predicted results agree reasonably well with the measured values. The quenching rate through the critical temperature range has great influence on the hardness of the alloy, and that must be larger than 500°C/s in order to attain the highest hardness.

34248208009	Effect of solution on fracture toughness of 7A55 aluminum alloy	The effect of solution on fracture toughness of 7A55 aluminum alloy was investigated by optical microscopy, tensile test, Kahn tear test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that solution temperature has significant effects on fracture toughness of 7A55 aluminum alloy. The solution temperatures are in the range of 450-490°C, the soluble particles decrease with the increase of solution temperature, and the fracture toughness increases and reaches the peak at 480°C, then drops because the grain grows. 7A55 aluminum alloy has a high quenching sensitivity, and a slow quenching rate induces coarse precipitates, which is harmful to fracture toughness of the alloy.

34250359940	Influence of quench rate and zirconium content on intergranular corrosion of 7055 type aluminum alloy	The influence of quench rate and zirconium content on the intergranular corrosion of 7055 type aluminum alloy was investigated by optical microscopy (OM) and transmission electron microscopy (TRM). The results show that the increase of zirconium content and quench rate can improve the resistance to intergranualr corrosion. The zirconium content more than 0.1% results in the significant decrease of quench sensitivity relative to intergranular corrosion. The addition of zirconium inhibits recrystallization and refines grains, and the increase of quench rate decreases grain boundary precipitate free zone, which improves intergranular corrosion resistance.

34548712830	Effect of Zr content on quench sensitivity of AIZnMgCu alloys	The effect of Zr content on quench sensitivity of AIZnMgCu alloys was investigated by mechanical properties testing and microstructure observations. The results show that with the increase of Zr the quench sensitivity relative to hardness and strength increases, while that relative to elongation decreases. From hardness and strength viewpoints, the low quench sensitivity is observed for the Zr-free and 0.05% Zr-containing alloys, which is quite quench sensitive from the ductility viewpoint. The largest quench sensitivity relative to hardness and strength is observed for 0.1% Zr-containing alloy, this is mainly due to large amount of high angle grain boundaries and incoherent Al

38049098802	Effect of quench rates on fracture behavior of AlZnMgCu(Zr) alloy	The effect of quench rates on the fracture behavior of AlZnMgCu(Zr) alloy was investigated by ambient tensile testing, optical microscope, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that intergranular fracture prevails as quench rates decrease for the alloy with Zr < 0.1%, which is primarily attributed to the increased grain boundary precipitate-free-zone (PFZ) width. For the alloy with Zr ≥ 0.1% the failure mode is changed from predominant transgranular void growth to intergranular and transgranular shear fracture with decreasing the quench rates. The intergranular fracture is primarily caused by wide grain boundary precipitates free zone, while transgranular shear fracture is due to coarse equilibrium η particles in the grains induced by slow quench.

38749136692	Effect of pre-precipitation after solution on mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of aluminium alloy 7A55	The influence of pre-precipitation at 440°C after solution on the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of aluminium alloy 7A55 was investigated by hardness tests, conductivity tests and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that with increasing the pre-precipitation time, the density of the precipitates in the matrix becomes higher and then the size becomes larger. As a result the hardness and strength increase first and then decrease. At the same time, the particles at the grain boundaries become larger with wider precipitate free zone, and the discontinuity of these particles increases first and then decreases with increasing pre-precipitation time. Consequently, intergranular corrosion and exfoliation corrosion resistance increase first and then decrease.

34247388915	Influence of aging on quench sensitivity effect of 7055 aluminum alloy	The influence of aging on the quench sensitivity effect of 7055 aluminum alloy was investigated by electrical conductivity test, ambient temperature tensile properties test and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that many coarse equilibrium η particles precipitate in grains and on grain boundaries in the alloy during slow quenching after solution treatment, which reduces the solutes available for aging hardening. Meanwhile, the vacancy concentration is also decreased, which is unfavorable for homogeneous nucleation. Thus, the mechanical properties of slow-quenched alloy after aging are decreased. Duplex aging has slight influence on the mechanical properties of the rapid-quenched alloy, but increases that of the slow-quenched one, thus eliminates the quench sensitivity effect to some extent. This is because that duplex aging results in more amounts of dispersing and homogeneously distributing hardening precipitates, and reduces the negative effect due to lower vacancy concentration. The optimal duplex aging in this investigation is 100°C, 24 h+121°C, 24 h.

79952283222	Effects of pre-stretching and ageing on the strength and fracture toughness of aluminum alloy 7050	The effects of the pre-stretching and ageing on the microstructure, strength and fracture toughness of the 7050 aluminum alloy were investigated by means of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, tensile test and the plane-strain fracture toughness test. The results indicate that the peak aged 7050 aluminum alloy possesses a higher strength, but its fracture toughness is poor. The high temperature and a subsequent low temperature ageing improve the fracture toughness by 8% while the strength is decreased by 3.5%. The fracture toughness of the over aged 7050 aluminum alloy is enhanced by 29% with a decrease in the strength of 7%. The retrogression and reaging provides an optimum combination of the strength and fracture toughness, which improves the fracture toughness by 17% without sacrificing the strength. After the pre-stretching, the precipitates within grains become coarse for all the ageing tempers which results in a lower strength. While the strength difference between the matrix and the grain boundary become lower and the area fraction of the grain boundary precipitates become smaller, leading to the higher fracture toughness. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84867314315	Effects of retrogression and reaging on strength and fracture toughness of aluminum alloy 7050	The effects of retrogression and reaging (RRA) on the tensile property and fracture toughness of aluminum alloy 7050 were investigated by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, tensile and toughness tests. The results show that during the retrogression treating, one part of GP zone dissolves into Al matrix and the other grows, and then transforms into η′ phase. At the same time, the η′ phase transforms into η phase constantly. And the η phase becomes coarse gradually. With the retrogression time elongating, the strength of the alloy falls to a valley value before increasing to a peak value, and then monotonically decreases. Meanwhile, the strength of the reaged alloys first increases and then decreases. The strength of the reaged alloys is larger than that of the retrogressed alloys. With the retrogression time elongating, the fracture toughness of alloy 7050 RRA retrogressed at 190°C increases. However, the fracture toughness of alloy 7050 RRA retrogressed at 170°C and 150°C increases to a peak value before decreasing to a valley value and then increases. The fracture toughness of the retrogressed alloys is larger than that of the reaged alloys. With the retrogression time elongating, the main fracture mechanism changes from the intergranular fracture to transgranular fracture.

84877268234	Influence of exfoliation corrosion on tensile properties of a high strength Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy	The influence of exfoliation corrosion on the tensile properties of a high strength Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy was investigated by ambient temperature tensile testing, optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). After exfoliation corrosion immersion, blisters and corrosion pits can be seen on the sheet surface, which lead to loss of materials and notches. A number of intergranular cracks are observed to initiate at the bottom of the corrosion-induced notches and propagate rapidly into the bulk materials during tensile. Consequently, exfoliation corrosion results in significant loss of strength and brittle fracture. EBSD results show that the crack propagation path is primarily along the grain boundaries with misorientation of ∼45, and coincidence site lattice (CSL) boundaries are slightly more resistant to crack. © 2013 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The results reveal that overageing temper can effectively reduce corrosion sensitivity caused by peak-ageing treatment. The comparison of corrosion resistance in the over-aged and severely over-aged alloys shows significant dependence of the changes in corrosion resistance with ageing time on quench rate.

84896984309	Precipitation behavior in Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy after direct quenching	The precipitation behavior in an Al-6.8Zn-1.9Mg-1.0Cu-0.12Zr alloy after direct quenching from solution heat treatment temperature of 470°C to 205-355°C was investigated by means of hardness tests, electrical conductivity tests, and transmission electron microscopy. At temperatures below 265°C, the hardness increased gradually to a peak value and then decreased rapidly with time. At 265 °C, the hardness was almost unchanged within the initial 2000 s and then decreased gradually. At higher temperatures, the hardness decreased slowly with time. The electrical conductivity started to increase after a certain period of time and then tended to maintain a constant value at all temperatures. Microstructure examination indicated heterogeneous precipitation of the η phase at grain boundaries and inside grains during holding at 205 °C and 325 °C. Based on the electrical conductivity data, the precipitation kinetics could be described quite well by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Komolgorov relationship with a n value varying between 0.78 and 1.33. The activation energy was estimated to be about 44.9 kJ/mol, which is close to that expected for a dislocation diffusion mechanism. Time-temperature-transformation diagrams were constructed and the nose temperature ranged from 295 °C to 325 °C. © 2014 The Korean Institute of Metals and Materials and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

43949094165	Influence of quench transfer time on microstructure and mechanical properties of 7055 aluminum alloy	The influence of quench transfer time on the microstructure and mechanical properties of 7055 aluminum alloy with and without zirconium was investigated by tensile properties test, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. For the Zr-free alloy, the strength increases to the highest value at 20 s with transfer time, and then decreases slightly. The elongation decreases slowly with transfer time within 20 s, and more rapidly after 20 s. For the Zr-containing alloy, prolonging transfer time within 20 s results in slight decrease in the strength and elongation, and rapid drop of which is observed after 20 s. For the Zr-free alloy, prolonging transfer time can increase the percentage of intergranular fracture, which is mainly caused by wide grain boundary precipitate free zone. The failure mode of the Zr-containing alloy is modified from the predominant transgranular void growth and intergranular fracture to transgranular shear and intergranular fracture with increase in the transfer time, which is attributed to the wider grain boundary precipitate free zone and coarse equilibrium η phases in the matrix. © 2008 Central South University.

56549116348	Effect of retrogression processing on mechanical properties and intergranular corrosion of 7050 aluminum alloy	The effect of retrogression processing on the mechanical properties and intergranular corrosion was investigated by means of hardness and electrical conductivity test, optical microscopy (OM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that aging of 120 °C/20 h leads to the highest hardness but low intergranular corrosion resistance. Compared with T6 temper, higher strength and intergranular corrosion resistance can be obtained by retrogression at lower temperature for a long time. The best properties are obtained through 190 °C/60 min retrogression. After pre-aging of 120 °C/20 h, retrogression of 190 °C/60 min, and re-aging of 120 °C/24 h, the tensile strength, yield strength, elongation and maximum depth of intergranular corrosion of the studied alloy are 593 MPa, 571 MPa, 10.5% and 0.05 mm, respectively. The TEM observation results show that there are more spaced and coarser particles on the grain boundaries while the microstructures are similar to those of T6 temper in the matrix, which makes contributions to the properties.

56849089498	Effect of retrogression time on intergranular corrosion of 7050 aluminum alloy	The effects of retrogression time on the mechanical properties and intergranular corrosion (IGC) resistance of 7050 aluminum alloy were investigated by means of hardness and electrical conductivity test, optical microscopy (OM) and transmission electron microcopy (TEM). The results show that the highest yield strength and IGC resistance are obtained by 190°C/60 min retrogression and reaging. But when the alloy is treated near the lowest value of hardness curve of retrogression, the lowest IGC resistance is gotten by 190 °C/4 min retrogression treatment. The TEM observation shows that the grain boundary precipitates are continuous and coarse by 190 °C/4 min retrogression treatment, and no obvious precipitate free zone (PFZ) is observed. With retrogression time increasing, more spaced and coarser grain boundary precipitates are observed, and the PFZ becomes wider, which can attribute to improve IGC resistance of 7050 aluminum alloy.

It is showed that, the distance from the quenching end where hardness decreases by 10% is about 60 mm. The reducing of mechanical properties is mainly caused by precipitation of equilibrium η phase. The critical average quenching cooling rate for precipitation of η phase is about 40 °C/s, at which the volume fraction of η phase is about 2.1%. When the critical average quenching cooling rate is lower than 40 °C/s, three processes of formation and growth of η phase-recrystallization-formation of incoherent Al3Zr dispersoid happen.

58249134407	Effects of quenching transferring time on the intergranular corrosion resistance of aluminum alloy 7055	Effects of quenching transferring time on the intergranular corrosion resistance of aluminum alloy containing Zr or free were observed by OM (optical microscope) and SEM (scanning electronic microscope). The results reveal that with increasing in the quenching transferring time, the intergranular corrosion depth is increased, showing the fading of intergranular corrosion resistance of alloy. However, the intergranular corrosion resistance of the alloy containing Zr is superior to that of one free Zr. The increase of quenching transferring time results in widening grain boundary precipitate free zone, which is primarily responsible for the decrease of intergranular corrosion resistance. The Zr addition can increase intergranular corrosion resistance as a result of inhibiting recrystallization.

67649227755	TTP curve of aluminum alloy 7050	The time-temperature-property (TTP) curve of aluminum alloy 7050 was determined by an interrupted quench method. The results show that the quench sensitive temperature range of TTP curve of alloy is 240-420°C with the nose temperature of 330°C. Microstructure observation indicates that the supersaturated solid solution decomposites and particles precipitate during quench process, the precipitation rate is the highest at about 330°C. A number of coarse equilibrium η particles precipitate at grain boundaries and in the grains during isothermal-holding at 330°C. Prolonging holding time leads to more and coarser η particles in the matrix, which results in loss of solutes and decrease of subsequent aging hardening effect, and more spaced η particles at the grain boundary that widen precipitation free zone. In the quench sensitive sector, primary precipitating reasons of η particles are severe phase transformation driving force and high diffusion rate of solute atoms. According the results, speeding up the cooling rate in the quench sensitive sector to reduce the precipitation of equilibrium phase is meaningful, and at higher temperature, decreasing the cooling rate is helpful to relieve the effect of thermal load.

71449098251	Prediction of the surface segregation of trace elements on the Al(100) surface by density functional theory	A simplified 9-layer slab model was created using periodic density functional theory calculation to predict the tendency of trace elements to undergo surface segregation. Using this approach, nine different trace element atoms (Fe, Si, Mg, Cu, Mn, Ga, In, Sn, and Pb) were substituted into the (100) plane in a pure aluminum foil surface and the surface segregation energies were calculated. The results were in very good agreement with the available experimental data. There were various correlations between the segregation energy and the relaxed position on the surface of the substituted atom, the radius of the substitute atom and the experimental surface energy of the metal. A negative segregation energy indicated that the trace element atoms were able to segregate and move to the surface while a positive segregation energy implied a tendency to move into the bulk material. Trace element atoms segregated on the Al foil surface and led to many defects and dislocations which can increase initial pitting nucleation sites and enhance the density of pitting for Al foils. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.

Results indicated that the chemical potentials of the surface Al atoms, increased 0.13,0.17, 0.57, and 0.64 eV, and their dissolution electrode potentials shifted -0.04, -0.06, -0.19, and -0.21 V with regards to pure Al when the content of Pb on the Al(100) surface was 1/9, 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 monolayer coverages, respectively. The negative potential shift of the Pb-containing Al alloy indicates easier dissolution compared to the pure Al surfaces. The presence of Pb results in an inner relaxation of the Al surface atoms, and the surface structure as well as chemical environment changes. The chemical potential and the dissolution electrode potential are shown to be dependent on the chemical environment of the surface atoms. A Mülliken charge population analysis also indicate that at higher Pb content, the electron exchange between Pb and Al atoms increase, which results in a negatively charged aluminum surface and a reduced surface potential; the surface work function decreases, and this promotes the electrochemical corrosion of the aluminum surface. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.

76049120790	Effect of step-quenching on microstructure of aluminum alloy 7055	The effect of step-quenching on the microstructure of aluminum alloy 7055 after artificial aging was studied by hardness testing and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Step-quenching leads to decomposition of solid solution and heterogeneous precipitation of equilibrium phase mainly on dispersoids and at grain boundaries; thus lower hardness after aging. Prolonging isothermal holding at 415 °C results in coarser and more spaced η phase particles at grain boundaries with wider precipitates free zone, and lower density of larger η′ hardening precipitates inside grains after aging. Isothermal holding at 355 °C results in heterogeneous precipitation of η phase both on dispersoids and at grain boundaries. Isothermal holding at 235 °C results in heterogeneous precipitation of η phase first, and then S phase. Precipitates free zones are created around these coarse η and S phase particles after aging. Prolonging isothermal holding at these two temperatures leads to fewer η′ hardening precipitates inside grains, larger and more spaced η phase particles at grain boundaries and wider grain boundary precipitates free zone after aging. © 2010 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

77049090203	Investigation of quench sensitivity of high strength Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys by time-temperature-properties diagrams	The quench sensitivity of some typical high strength Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys, including 7075, 7175, 7050, 7010, 7055, 7085 and 1933, was investigated by time-temperature-properties (TTP) diagrams which were from the present paper and literature. The drop in the mechanical properties due to decreased quenching rate was predicted by quench factor analysis method. The nose temperature of TTP diagrams was the highest for 7055 alloy and the lowest for 7085 alloy. The critical time at the nose temperature was the shortest for 7055 alloy and the longest for 1933 alloy. Decreased quenching rate to 10 k/s led to drop in the properties less than 2% for 7085 and 1933 alloys, but more than 20% for 7075, 7175 and 7055 alloy. Thus, 7075, 7175 and 7055 alloys were the most quench sensitive alloys, while 7085 and 1933 alloys were the least quench sensitive ones. The differences in the quench sensitivity of these alloys were explained mainly based on its chemical compositions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results show that the microstructure, texture, tensile property and fracture toughness are inhomogeneous in different layers along the thickness direction. At the same thickness, the tensile property and fracture toughness show appreciable anisotropy. From the surface to the center, the average sizes of the coarse second phase particles and recrystallization grains increase. Near the surface of the plate, typical shear textures {111}<110> and cube textures {001}<100> are observed, while the center of the plate shows typical β fiber texture with a scattering of cube texture. The quarter layer of the plate seems to serve as a transition layer. From the surface to the center, the strength is inhomogeneous in the rolling direction and long transverse direction. The strength in the center is smaller than that on the surface of the plate. The strength and fracture toughness show appreciable anisotropy at the same thickness. The strength in the rolling direction is higher than that in the long transverse direction and the short transverse direction, and the fracture toughness in the L-T orientation is higher than that in the T-L and S-L orientations at the same thickness. The fracture mode in the L-T orientation is trangranular fracture, and in the S-L orientation the fracture mode is intergranular fracture. In the T-L orientation, the fracture mode is a mixed fracture, the fraction of the trangranular fracture is lower than that in the L-T orientation, and the fraction of the intergranular fracture is lower than that in the S-L orientation.

The results show that the system energy is decreased by 0.46 eV and the highest energy barrier is 0.34 eV when the impurity atom In moves from the second layer to the topmost layer in the Al (001) slab. The system energy is almost constant when impurity atoms segregate from the third layer to the second layer. Higher energy (0.65 eV) was needed to overcome the energy barriers. So, In showing a strong segregation to the clean Al (001) surface is thermodynamically favorable. © 2010 Chin. Phys. Soc.

77956617643	Effect of microstructure on the quench sensitivity of AlZnMgCu alloys	The effect of microstructure on the quench sensitivity of 7055 type aluminum alloys was investigated by hardness testing, optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that the homogenized and hot-rolled alloys without Zr and the homogenized alloy with Zr were not quench sensitive, while the hot-rolled alloy with Zr was quite quench sensitive. The reason was analyzed according to the difference in the microstructure in these alloys, i.e. type of nucleation sites including dispersoids, (sub)grain boundaries and constituent particles for heterogeneous precipitation during slow quenching. Quench-induced η phase was observed mainly on large dispersoids and (sub)grain boundaries. In the homogenized and hot-rolled alloys without Zr, grain boundaries, which were the main heterogeneous precipitation nucleation sites, resulted in low quench sensitivity.

78651092673	Effect of prestretching on fracture toughness of 7050 aluminum alloy	The effects of prestretching on the tensile property and fracture toughness of 7050 aluminum alloy plate were investigated by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, tensile and toughness tests. The results show that many dislocations are generated in the prestretch process, and the dislocations can provide efficient nucleation sites for larger equilibrium phase η in the ageing. With increasing the prestretching, the size of the η phase increases, which results in the reduction in the strength. Furthermore, the distance between precipitates in the grain boundaries becomes larger. The precipitates discontinuously distribute in the grain boundaries. The strength-differential between the matrix and the boundary is reduced, which promotes more homogeneous deformation, and is beneficial to the fracture toughness. With increasing the prestretching, the precipitates in the grain boundary become coarser, and the precipitate free zones become wider, which assists the strain concentration in the deformation process and results in continuous decrease in the resistance to fracture. In a word, with increasing the prestretching, the fracture toughness increases.

The distribution of pits and the morphological features after etching were observed by metallographic microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The galvano-chemistry performance of foils was analyzed by using polarization curve. The results show that when the foils are annealed at various temperatures (470-560°C) for different annealing times (0.5-4 h), the best annealing technology is at 500°C for 1 h, which will increase the concentration as well as the distribution homogeneity of the trace elements in the surface layer; it will get bad result if the annealing temperature or the time is increased.

78951485135	DFT study on surface properties and dissolution trends of Al(1 0 0) surfaces doped with Zn, Ga, In, Sn and Pb	In this paper, the properties and dissolution trends of the surfaces doped with different metal atoms on the Al(1 0 0) surface were investigated by the density functional theory calculations. A surface impurity model was proposed by replacing the topmost surface layer Al atoms by Me (Me = Zn, Ga, In, Sn and Pb) atoms with the coverage of 1/9, 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 monolayer, respectively. Results show that the surface energy of Me-Al(1 0 0) surfaces depends primarily on the nature of the impurity atom species and the monolayer coverage. The work function of Me-Al surfaces is smaller than that of pure Al(1 0 0) surface, and decreases almost linearly with the amount of Me. It is found that the Me-Al alloys are more easily dissolvable than the pure Al, due to the fact that the electrochemical dissolution potential shifts were negative for all Me-Al(1 0 0) surfaces with respect to the clean pure Al(1 0 0) surface. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

79851516879	Effect of solution treatment on the strength and fracture toughness of aluminum alloy 7050	The effect of the solution treatment on the tensile property and fracture toughness of aluminum alloy 7050 were investigated by means of optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), tensile test and the plane-strain fracture toughness test. The results show that with increasing single-stage solution temperature, the volume fraction of the residual phase decreases, but the volume fraction of the recrystallized grains and the size of the sub-grains increase. Thus, the strength and fracture toughness of the single-stage solution treated samples increase first and then decrease. The enhanced solution treated samples result in an improved dissolution of the residual phase, a lower recrystallized grains fraction and smaller sub-grains, which leads to a higher strength and fracture toughness than that of the single-stage solution treated samples. The grain structure of the high temperature pre-precipitation treated samples is similar to that of the enhanced solution treated samples. However, the high temperature pre-precipitation treated samples exhibit a lower strength and fracture toughness, due to a mass of AlZnMgCu phase precipitating from the matrix. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that there are plenty of GP zone and η' phase in the grains after the aging at low temperature for a short time. For the secondary aging at elevated temperature, the precipitates are transformed to η phase and η' phase gradually. Furthermore, with the increase of the secondary aging time, the precipitates at the grain boundaries become coarse and tend to be discontinuous, and the precipitate-free zone (PFZ) becomes wider at the same time. With the increase of the secondary aging time, the strength increases first and then decreases, while the fracture toughness decreases first and then increases. The main fracture mechanism changes from shear transgranular fracture to intergranular fracture, and then to ductile transgranular fracture.

The results show that compared with the peak aged sample, the ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of the two-step aged samples (110°C/6 h+160°C/8 h or 120°C/12 h+160°C/6 h) are decreased by 3.8% and 1.0%, respectively. Meanwhile, the conductivity is enhanced by 19.5% with an evident improvement in the stress corrosion cracking resistant. The temperature of the second step aging is the most significant factor to control the properties of the alloy.

The results show that through the aging at low temperature for a short time, the main age-hardening precipitates in the matrix are GP zone and η' phase, then through the second step aging at elevated temperature the age-hardening precipitates are transformed to η phase gradually. And with the increase of the aging time, the η phase and precipitates on grain boundary become coarser gradually, PFZ becomes wider at the same time, which results in the increase of hardness, then decreases and continuous channels become discontinuously distributed, and the resistance to exfoliation corrosion of the 7050 aluminium alloy plate is improved. The exfoliation corrosion development depends on grain boundary microstructure and chemical composition, starts and expands with formation and development of pitting corrosion. With the increase of the aging time, the exfoliation corrosion degree becomes serious, then improves, and serious again.

The results show that the strength and elongation decrease after exfoliation corrosion, the drop percentage is significantly higher for the elongation than that for the strength. The drop percentage in the tensile properties after exfoliation corrosion is higher than that after intergranular corrosion. After corrosion, the strength is the highest for RRA-treated sheet, and the elongation is the highest for T73-treated sheet. For the T6-treated sheet subjected to exfoliation corrosion, brittle fracture occurs during tensile test. The drop percentage in the properties due to corrosion is the highest for the T6-treated sheet, intermediate for the RRA-treated sheet and the lowest for the T73-treated sheet. Many notches and intergranular microcracks are present on the surface of the sheet due to corrosion, and this increases the number of the crack sources, thus deteriorates the tensile properties. The size and distribution of the second phase at grain boundaries have influence on the degree of corrosion damage, consequently the drop percentage in the tensile properties.

The dynamic recrystallization occurred in the weld nugget zone and the size of recrystallized grains was smaller than that in the thermo-mechanically affected zone, besides, θ' and θ phase precipitated. The thermo-mechanically affected zone was divided into three ones: the zone close to the thermo-mechanically affected zone, where coarse θ' precipitates were observed; the middle zone, where the mainly θ precipitates appeared; and the zone close to the heat-affected zone, where both thin θ' and θ precipitates were observed. In the heat-affected zone, the size of θ' precipitates was less than those in the base metal zone.

84862014004	Influence of aging on the hardenability of 7055 aluminum alloy thick plate	The influence of aging on the hardenability of 7055 aluminum alloy thick plate was investigated by means of end-quench test, optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results show that the hardenability can be improved by long time natural aging before artificial aging. The hardened depth is about 78 mm after natural aging and only about 45 mm after artificial aging, but increased to be about 100 mm after natural and artificial aging. During slow quenching, the coarse η equilibrium phase forms, and the solute concentration and vacancy concentration are decreased, which lead to larger and fewer η' hardening precipitates, thus lower hardness after aging. The long time natural aging before artificial aging is favorable for formation of stable GP zones at slowly-cooled locations, and consequently more amount of dispersed and fine η' hardening precipitates, which give rise to higher hardness and simultaneously better hardenability. © Rright.

84862591922	Influence of solution heat treatment on strength and fracture toughness of aluminum alloy 7050	The influences of the solution heat treatment on the tensile properties and fracture toughness of the 7050 aluminum alloy were investigated by means of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the ambient temperature tensile tests and compact tension toughness testes. The results show that during the single-stage solution heat treatment, with the increase of solution temperature, coarse constituent particles are dissolved, and meanwhile, the percentage of recrystallization and the size of the subgrains increase. With the increase of solution temperature, the strength and fracture toughness firstly increase and then decrease. The two-stage solution heat treatment results in improved dissolution of coarse constituent particles, low recrystallization percentage and small size of subgrains. The strength and fracture toughness during the two-stage solution heat treatment are larger than the maximum of the single-stage solution heat treatment. The percentage of recrystallization and the size of the subgrains are small after pre-precipitation following solution heat treatment, but a large number of η phase aggregates at the subgrain boundary. Meanwhile, constituent particles dissolve out again from the matrix, which leads to the decrease of the strength and fracture toughness.

The results show that the tensile properties and corrosion resistance decrease with the increase of quench transfer time. At 90 s, the drop percentages of ultimate strength, yield strength and elongation are about 7.5%, 9% and 20%, respectively, and the corrosion depth increases by 400%. Prolonged transfer time results in coarse η equilibrium phase in the grains, which causes the strengthening effect decrease after aging, and wider precipitates free zone, which makes elongation and corrosion resistance decrease. In order to obtain high properties, the transfer time for the alloy products should be controlled to keep the temperature just before quenching no lower than about 366°C.

With decreasing the cooling rate, the number and size of quench-induced equilibrium phase increase, the number of η ' strengthening precipitates decreases and the width of precipitate free zone near grain boundaries increases.

84866534800	Effect of exfoliation corrosion on mechanical properties of 7055 aluminum alloy sheet	The effect of exfoliation corrosion on the mechanical properties of 7055 aluminum alloy sheet was investigated by ambient tensile testing, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that with the increase of the corrosion exposure time, both strength and elongation decrease rapidly within the initial 6 h and then slowly after 6 h. After corrosion exposure for 24 h, the ultimate strength is decreased to below 500 MPa and elongation is decreased to about 1%. After 48 h the strength and elongation are decreased by about 28% and 87%, respectively. Exfoliation corrosion exposure leads to a number of intergranular cracks and corrosion notches in the surface layer of the sheet. During the tensile test, stress concentration occurs at the bottom of corrosion notches, and thus the number of crack sources is increased, which is supposed to primarily be responsible for the decrease in the mechanical properties.

The results show that with the increase of the secondary aging time, the strength of the interrupt aged alloys first increases and then decreases. Meanwhile, the fracture toughness first increases and then decreases. Secondary precipitation takes place in the low temperature aging process, which results in higher strength than that of the peak aged alloy. With the increase of the secondary aging time, the precipitates at grain boundaries of the interrupt aged alloy become coarser and discontinuous, which leads to higher fracture toughness than that of the peak aged alloy.

Through seven-pass hot-compression deformation, the finishing temperatures were controlled to 300, 340, 370, 400 and 430°C respectively at initial hot-compression temperature 430°C. The microstructures of the alloy after hot-compression deformation and solution-aging treatment were investigated by the means of optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that with the increase of finishing temperature, the flow stress of the same pass is gradually decreased and the second phase particles are reduced, while the small-size subgrains are gradually grown to the grains with straight boundary. At low finishing temperature, where more deformation energy is stored after deformation, there is a large number of recrystallization structure after solution-aging treatment. Dynamic and static softening consumes more deformation energy during the hot deformation with the increase of finishing temperature and the recrystallization structure is gradually reduced after solution-aging treatment.

84871453332	Effect of hot rolling on hardenability of 7055 aluminum alloy	To investigate the effect of hot rolling on hardenability of 7055 aluminum alloy, the properties and microstructure at different cooling rates determined by end-quench method, hardness test, optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were studied, and the results showed that the hardenability was decreased significantly after hot rolling with the hardened depth deceasing from about 100 mm to 45 mm. This is because the number and size of η equilibrium phase formed during slow quenching are changed by hot rolling. Hot rolling increases the nucleation sites for η equilibrium phase, and introduces a number of dislocations which prompt growth of η equilibrium phase. As a result, in the hot-rolled and solution treated alloy, more η equilibrium phase particles with larger size are formed during slow quenching, which decreases the number of strengthening η' precipitates after aging. Thus the drop in the hardness with the decreasing of cooling rate is increased, which decreases the hardenability.

A number of equilibrium phase particles tend to form on dispersoids and at grain boundaries after slow quench. The lower the cooling rate, the more the quench-induced phase, the fewer the η′ strengthening precipitates after aging and the wider the precipitate free zone near grain boundaries.

The results indicate that the oxides exist at the interface between the matrix and transverse welding zone rather than longitudinal welding seam.

The results indicate that the peak-aged 7050 aluminum alloy possesses the highest hardness, but its corrosion resistance is poor. The overaging and the retrogression and re-aging treatments lower the hardness, but improve the corrosion resistance of the 7050 aluminum alloy compared with the peak-aging treatment. At the high temperature aging stage of the high temperature and a subsequent low temperature aging, GP zone can be reversed, which is beneficial to the nucleation of η′ and η phases. Consequently, the precipitates within grains become coarser and distribute uniformly, leading to the decrease of hardness. Meanwhile, the precipitates at grain boundaries become coarser and discontinuous resulting in an improved corrosion resistance.

The results show that many dislocations are generated in the process of pre-stretching, and the dislocations can provide efficient nucleation sites for η phase during the aging. With the increase of the pre-stretching deformation, the number and size of the η phase within grains increases, which results in the reduction in the mechanical strength and improvement in the electrical conductivity. As the density of dislocations increases, the vacancy concentration decreases, which makes the distance between precipitates at grain boundaries become relatively lager first, and then reduce, and the corrosion resistance improve first, and then decrease. Meanwhile, precipitate-free zones (PFZ) become wider first, and then gradually disappear with the increase of the pre-stretching deformation, which causes the corrosion resistance to decrease first, and then improve. So, under the influence of the precipitates at grain boundaries and the PFZ together, the corrosion resistance gradually decreases first, and then decreases quickly with the increase of the pre-stretching deformation.

The results of ODFs and fiber show that the orientation densities of the S {123}<634> and Cu {112}<111> components increase in both the additional-annealed samples and the 0.11 mm final cold-rolled foils. And the EBSD results demonstrate that cube nuclei can be identified in the deformed matrix of those additional-annealed samples. It is suggested that the strengthening of cube texture can be brought out by the increasing of components of S and Cu and the formation of cube nuclei caused by additional-annealing. Moreover, it is found that the cube texture increases first and then decreases with increasing additional-annealing temperature, and it is the strongest at 180°C. The strengthening of cube texture by additional-annealing is proposed as the result of oriented growth of cube subgrains.

84901838566	Effect of pre-aging temperature in retrogression and re-aging treatment on stress corrosion resistance of 7050 aluminum alloy	The effect of the pre-aging temperature in retrogression and re-aging (RRA) treatment on stress corrosion resistance of 7050 aluminum alloy was investigated by means of hardness tests, conductivity tests, slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) tests, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that when the pre-aging temperature increases, the main intragranular precipitates in 7050 aluminum alloy transform from GP zones to η' phases after RRA. The grain boundary precipitates become coarser and consequently the grain boundary becomes discontinuous, which leads to the reduction of sensitivity of stress corrosion. At the meantime, the precipitate free zone (PFZ) becomes wider, whose width goes up to 140 nm when pre-aging temperature rises to 120°C, causing stress concentration and anode dissolution which are harmful to the stress corrosion resistance of the alloy. When the pre-aging temperature is 80°C, as in under-aged condition at the pre-aging stage of RRA, the alloy shows better stress corrosion resistance. The tensile strength, elongation and stress corrosion index (I

84903707582	Effect of pre-ageing temperature and retrogression heating rate on microstructure and properties of 7055 aluminium alloy	The effect of pre-aging temperature and retrogression heating rate on the mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of the RRA treated 7055 aluminium alloy were investigated by hardness, electrical conductivity, tensile properties test, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The microstructures under various RRA treated samples were discussed. The results reveal that, near peak aged state, the pre-aging treatment is more applicable to industrial processing due to the slow retrogression heating rates in 7055 aluminium alloy middle thick plate. After (105°C, 24 h) (3°C/min over a right arrow) (190°C, 50 min)+(120°C, 24 h) treating, the 7055 aluminum alloy possess a better combination of both strength and electrical conductivity than those of T6 and T73 state.

84903455864	Effect of quenching rate on aging behavior of 7085 aluminum alloy	The effect of quenching rate on aging behavior of 7085 aluminum alloy was investigated by means of end quenching test, hardness test, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The results show that the faster the quenching rate is, the higher the peak hardness is. With the quenching rate increasing, the lower the aging temperature is, the shorter time reaching the peak hardness is and the higher the hardness gets, which is related to the decrease of the vacancy diffusion activation energy. With the aging temperature increasing, the time reaching the peak hardness gets closer and closer, when aging at 160°C, the peak aging time are all 10 h. TEM observation shows that, with the decrease of quenching rate, the number and the size of quench-induced equilibrium η phase increase. After aging, the number and the diffusion degree of η' strengthening precipitates decrease and the size becomes larger.

84906538206	Effect of homogenization time on quench sensitivity of 7085 aluminum alloy	The effect of homogenization time on quench sensitivity of a cast 7085 aluminum alloy was investigated by means of end-quenching test, optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The results show that with the increase of homogenization time from 48 h to 384 h, quench sensitivity increased slightly as the largest difference in the hardness was increased from 5.2% to 6.9% in the end-quenched and aged specimens. Prolonging homogenization had little effect on the grain structure, but improved the dissolution of soluble T phase and resulted in larger Al

84906539696	Exfoliation corrosion behavior of 7050-T6 aluminum alloy treated with various quench transfer time	The exfoliation corrosion (EFC) behavior of 7050-T6 aluminum alloy treated with various quench transfer time after solution heat treatment was investigated by standard EFC immersion tests, strength loss measurements after EFC tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscope (EIS) technique. The results showed that EFC resistance of the alloy decreased with increasing quench transfer time. Backscattered electron scanning electron microscope (SEM) together with transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations revealed that the coverage ratio and microstructure of precipitates at grain boundary area are the most important factors which influence the EFC susceptibility of the alloy, while precipitate-free zone (PFZ) near grain boundary has no or only a minor effect on it. In addition, galvanostatic measurements of the alloy present a good correlation between EFC resistance and transients in potential. The cumulated number of transients in potential can be used to evaluate EFC resistance of the alloy. © 2014 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

84914121752	Microstructure and mechanical properties of friction stir welded Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy	The microstructure and mechanical properties of friction stir welded Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy sheet were investigated by means of hardness and tensile tests, optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. The hardness profile of the weld exhibits a W shape with the lowest value in the thermo-mechanically affected zone on the advancing side. The tensile strength and elongation of the weld are about 71% and 72% that of the base material. In the nugget zone, there are a number of fine recrystallized grains and dispersed precipitates at grain boundaries. In the thermo-mechanically affected zone, the grain size is not uniform and there are a number of precipitates at grain boundaries. In the heat affected zone, the grain structure is similar to the base material.

84914164968	Through-thickness strain and texture gradients of Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloy sheets produced by snake rolling	The evolution of through-thickness strain gradients during snake rolling (SR), which introduces an horizontal offset between upper and lower rolls, of Al-Mg-Si-Cu sheets was investigated with the inscribed lines in side including rolling and normal direction of sheets. The complete pole figures were used to investigate the influence of such rolling on texture evolution. The results revealed that the SR rolled sheet developed a continuous through-thickness shear strain gradients and shear textures. The surface in contact with the slower roll (the lower roll) developed the largest shear strain and the strongest shear texture. While for the conventional symmetric rolling (CR), the sheet developed a small shear strain gradient which is symmetrical about the centerline of the sheet with nearly negligible shear strain and texture at the center of the sheet.
