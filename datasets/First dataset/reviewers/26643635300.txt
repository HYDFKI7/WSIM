16444386367	Unified quantum field theory of light absorption by defect centers	Trapped electrons in crystals are responsible for many important effects on crystals: lattice relaxation, electron-ion correlation, lattice-frequency shift, and so on. These electron-phonon interaction effects cause peak shifts and give rise to various multiphonon structures in the absorption and emission spectra of trapped electrons. The present treatment for interactions of trapped electrons with a crystal does not include the standard second-quantized field theory, which neglects the quantum many-body effects of crystals. Therefore, up to now no universal light-absorption theory includes various effects of trapped electrons on crystals. For this reason, a unified, second-quantized field theory of optical absorption, which contains both linear and quadratic electron-phonon interactions is established. In this field theory we derive a universal, analytical spectral function of the absorption coefficient, which describes the whole absorption spectrum of an arbitrary color center. ©1999 The American Physical Society.

17544364289	Theory of one-dimensional quantum gap solitons	We establish a quantum theory of gap solitons in a one-dimensional periodic dielectric structure [distributed Bragg reflector (DBR)] of a Kerr nonlinearity. The electromagnetic field in the structure is quantized within the two-band approximation. The basic idea for this quantization is that incident photons with frequencies in the band gap of the DBR are scattered into the upper "conduction" and lower "valence" bands by the nonlinearity. The effective Hamiltonian of quantum gap solitons is derived within the effective-mass regime. The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are constructed exactly by Bethe's ansatz method. We find that in certain band gaps of the DBR these eigenstates can be bound, consisting of one or more photon pairs from the conduction and valence bands. These bound multiphoton states are optical analogs of exciton molecules [optical multiexcitons (OMEs)]. Their existence should be manifested by the discrete spectrum of band-gap transmission as a function of the transmitted photon number and by the multiexponential falloff of intensity-intensity correlations on a 0.1-mm scale. Quantum gap solitons are shown to arise as superpositions of OMEs whenever the nonlinear binding exceeds phonon scattering.

18444378743	Radiation properties of a Kerr nonlinear blackbody	In a Kerr nonlinear blackbody, bare photons with opposite wave vectors and helicities are bound into pairs and unpaired photons are transformed into a different kind of quasiparticle, the nonpolariton. The nonpolariton system constitutes free thermal radiation in the blackbody. The present paper investigates the radiation properties of a Kerr nonlinear blackbody. We found that the spectral energy density and radiation pressure of a Kerr nonlinear blackbody are larger than those of a normal blackbody and that these two quantities are monotonically decreasing functions of the Kerr nonlinear coefficient. Above the transition temperature the photon system is in a normal thermal radiation state, but below the transition temperature it is in a squeezed thermal radiation state. In the transition from the normal to the squeezed thermal radiation state, the phase symmetry of the photon system is spontaneously broken. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

Two kinds of magnetic barrier configurations are employed: one is that the strength of the double δ-function in opposite directions is equal and the other is that the strength is unequal Similarities and differences of electronic transports are presented. It is found that the transmission and the conductance depend strongly on the shape of the magnetic barrier and the height of the electric barrier. The results indicate that this system does not possess any spin filtering and spin polarization and electron gases can realize perfect resonant tunneling and wave-vector filtering properties.

Gray restrain is brought in, and the relations between the grid and its eight neighbours are considered in calculating the gradient. There are several optics which are laid with Browster angle and the image collected by CCD includes many noises, so the components of the image are quite complex and the quality is bad. The advanced method has been proved that it is possible to get over the problem and get information about the size of damage accurately. In addition, systemic analysis and calculation of optic damages are presented. The result shows that the damage size calculated in advance accords with the real size, and the error is in the scope of permission. The image processing method can provide a useful approach for online inspection and automatization inspection of damage in optics.

33750586317	Squeezing states of magnons in a ferromagnet	The squeezing states of magnons in a ferromagnet were studied, which originate from the nonlinear interaction of magnons. Hamiltonian of magnons system was simplified by the second quantization method presented by Holstein and Primakoff. The nonlinear interaction term of Hamitltonian was dealt with by mean theory. The condition of achieving the squeezing states of magnons in ferromagnet was found, after the mean value of the spin fluctuation calculated. If the period of achieving squeezing states was measured, some useful information of the ferromagnet material, such as the international integral, was got. The squeezing states of magnons in ferromagnet can be detected by ferromagnetic resonance scattering. The bigger the squeezing degree is, the smaller the resonance absorption coefficient (RAC) is. The quantum fluctuation of the magnons squeezing states is lower than that of the coherent states, useful to improve the precision of detection.

Then temperature- dependent Bogoliubov transformation is introduced to generate a new representation which engenders the transition from the zero temperature to the finite temperature. At last, temperature-dependent quantum fluctuation properties of magnons are discussed in the thermal field. At lower temperature, we find that the fluctuation of spin-component at some given time regions can be below the zero-point fluctuation level of the vacuum state and exhibit a periodical squeezing behavior. In particular, these squeezed effects vanish with the increasing of temperature. These squeezing effects differ from the previous studies. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.

The thermodynamic properties of a Kerr nonlinear blackbody are investigated. At the transition temperature, the Gibbs free energy of the two phases is continuous but the entropy density of the two phases is discontinuous. Hence, there is a jump in the entropy density and this leads to a latent heat density. The photon system undergoes a first-order phase transition from the normal to the superfluid state. The transition temperature is characteristic of a concrete crystal.

A photon polaron is a photon dressed with a cloud of virtual transverse optical phonons, namely, the dressed photon. One of the most important properties of the photon polaron is an increased inert mass. Because of the effect of photon polarons, we find that the photon-photon interaction is enhanced greatly. The photon polaron is a quantum effect of cavity nonlinear optics but its increased inert mass is a classical property. © Copyright EPLA, 2013.

84874011746	Condensation state of ultra-cold bose atomic gases with noncontact interaction	Within the framework of quantum field theory, we find that uniform Bose atomic gases with noncontact interaction can undergo a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) condensation below a critical temperature. In the BCS condensation state, bare atoms with opposite wave vectors are bound into pairs, and unpaired bare atoms are transformed into a new kind of quasi-particle, i.e., the dressed atom. The atom-pair system is a condensate or a superfluid and the dressed-atom system is a normal fluid. At absolute zero temperature the condensate possesses a lowest negative energy. The critical temperature and the effective mass of dressed atoms are derived analytically. The transition from the BCS condensation state to the normal state is a first-order phase transition. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84875862318	Magnetoacoustic solitary waves in pair ion-electron plasmas	The nonlinear properties of magnetoacoustic solitary waves (MASWs) are investigated in magnetized pair ion-electron (PIE) plasmas. The three-fluid collisionless electromagnetic model is considered and the reductive perturbation method is employed to derive the Korteweg-de Vries equation for MASWs in PIE plasmas. It is found that the system under consideration admits compressive solitary structures. The effects of magnetic field intensity, plasma number density and negative ions concentration on MASWs are studied. This study may have relevance to nonlinear wave formation and the propagation of pair ion plasmas containing impurities. © 2013 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

84878039719	Dressed photons in a nonlinear Fabry-Pérot cavity	The photo-polaron in a two-dimensional optical microcavity is investigated within the framework of quantum statistical mechanics. Our experimental setup is based on a planar Fabry-Pérot cavity filled with a nonlinear nonpolar crystal. The Fabry-Pérot cavity provides a chemical potential and an effective mass for a photon, making the system formally equivalent to a two-dimensional gas of number-conserving, massive bosons. The incident photons interact with the Raman phonons in the crystal and hence are converted into quasiparticles, which we refer to as photo-polarons. A photo-polaron is a photon dressed with a cloud of virtual transverse-optical phonons, namely, the dressed photon. One of the most important properties of photo-polaron is an increased inert mass. Because of the effect of photo-polarons, we find that the photon-photon interaction is enhanced greatly.

84878521210	Electron transport in a ferromagnetic/normal/ferromagnetic tunnel junction based on the surface of a topological insulator	We theoretically study the electron transport properties in a ferromagnetic/normal/ferromagnetic tunnel junction, which is deposited on the top of a topological surface. The conductance at the parallel (P) configuration can be much bigger than that at the antiparallel (AP) configuration. Compared P with AP configuration, there exists a shift of phase which can be tuned by gate voltage. We find that the exchange field weakly affects the conductance of carriers for P configuration but can dramatically suppress the conductance of carriers for AP configuration. This controllable electron transport implies anomalous magnetoresistance in this topological spin valve, which may contribute to the development of spintronics. In addition, there shows an existence of Fabry-Perot-like electron interference in our model based on the topological insulator, which does not appear in the same model based on the two dimensional electron gas. © 2013 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84879900644	Head-on collision of electron acoustic solitary waves in dense magnetized electron-positron-ion plasma	In this paper, we study the head-on collision between two electron acoustic solitary waves (EASWs) in magnetized quantum electron-positron-ion plasma. Using the extended Poincaré-Lighthill-Kuo perturbation method, we obtain the Korteweg-de Vries equations, the phase shifts and the trajectories after the head-on collision of the two EASWs. It is found that the phase shifts are significantly affected by the values of the quantum parameter H, the ion to electron number density ratio δ, the electron cyclotron to electron plasma frequency ratio α and the obliqueness θ (propagation angle). © 2013 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

84884497585	Nonlinear magnetoacoustic waves in pair-ion plasma with dust impurity	Nonlinear properties of magnetoacoustic waves are investigated in magnetized pair-ion plasmas with dust impurity. Three-fluid collisionless magneto-hydrodynamic model is considered and reductive perturbation method is employed to derive Korteweg-de Vries equation for magnetoacoustic solitary waves (MASWs). The effects of the charge number of dust particles, magnetic field intensity, and plasma number density are studied on MASWs. It is found that the variation of parameters causes significant changes in solitary structures. The present investigation may be useful to understand formation and propagation of MASW structures in dust pair-ion plasmas. Copyright © 2013 Cambridge University Press.

0141564791	Quantum effects of thermal radiation in a Kerr nonlinear blackbody	A photon blackbody field in Kerr nonlinear crystal is a squeezed thermal radiation state in which there is a new kind of quasi particle, the nonpolariton. A nonpolariton is a condensate of virtual nonpolar phonons, with a bare photon acting as the nucleus of condensation. The propagation velocity of nonpolaritons is a monotonically increasing function of temperature, and the noise of one quadrature phase in the squeezed thermal radiation state can be below the noise level in the vacuum state. The photon system undergoes a second-order phase transition from the normal to the squeezed thermal radiation state. © 2002 Optical Society of America.

84891836513	Superfluid state of coherent light in nonlinear waveguides	We establish the photonic superfluid theory in waveguides made of self-defocussing polar crystals. In quantum theory it is shown that photons can sense an attractive effective interaction by exchange of virtual optical phonons. Such an interaction leads to the photonic superfluid state, in which a propagating photon pair consists of a combination of two photons with opposite transverse wave vector and spins. The most important property of the photonic superfluid state is that the system of photon pairs evolves without scattering attenuations. The traveling-wave superfluid state has the squeezing property and the soliton effect. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84905031306	Highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cell with GNS/MWCNT/PANI as a counter electrode	A graphene-based nanosheet composite/multiwalled carbon nanotube/polyaniline (GNS/MWCNT/PANI) was synthesized via an in situ polymerization technique and applied by the spin-coating method as a counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The combination of the high catalytic activity of PANI and outstanding conductivity of GNS/MWCNT improved the photovoltaic performance of the hybrid CE. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the GNS/MWCNT/PANI composite has high catalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide to iodide and low charge-transfer resistance at the electrolyte/electrode interface. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that the GNS/MWCNT/PANI-CE has a rough and porous structure and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of PANI coating on the surface of the GNS/CNT. In particular, current-voltage measurements showed the superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.52% of the DSSC based on GNS/MWCNT/PANI-CE compared to the PCE of 6.69% of the DSSC based on Pt-CE. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
