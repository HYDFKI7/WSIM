9244261620	Modulation of swarming and virulence by fatty acids through the RsbA protein in Proteus mirabilis	After sensing external signals, Proteus mirabilis undergoes a multicellular behavior called swarming which is coordinately regulated with the expression of virulence factors. Here we report that exogenously added fatty acids could act as signals to regulate swarming in P. mirabilis. Specifically, while oleic acid enhanced swarming, some saturated fatty acids, such as lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid, inhibited swarming. We also found that expression of hemolysin, which has been shown to be coordinately regulated with swarming, was also inhibited by the above saturated fatty acids. Previously we identified a gene, rsbA, which may encode a histidine-containing phosphotransmitter of the bacterial two-component signaling system and act as a repressor of swarming and virulence factor expression in P. mirabilis. We found that while myristic acid, lauric acid, and palmitic acid exerted their inhibitory effect on swarming and hemolysin expression through an RsbA-dependent pathway, the inhibition by stearic acid was mediated through an RsbA-independent pathway. Biofilm formation and extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production play an important role in P. mirabilis infection. We found that RsbA may act as a positive regulator of biofilm formation and EPS production. Myristic acid was found to slightly stimulate biofilm formation and EPS production, and this stimulation was mediated through an RsbA-dependent pathway. Together, these data suggest that fatty acids may act as environmental cues to regulate swarming and virulence in P. mirabilis and that RsbA may play an important role in this process.

1842424942	Community-Based Multiple Screening Model: Design, Implementation, and Analysis of 42,387 Participants Taiwan Community-Based Integrated Screening Group	BACKGROUND. Multiple disease screening may have several advantages over single disease screening because of the economics of scale, with the high yield of detecting asymptomatic diseases, the identification of multiple diseases or risk factors simultaneously, the enhancement of the attendance rate, and the efficiency of follow-up. METHODS. An integrated model of community-based multiple screening was designed and conducted between 1999 and 2001 in Keelung, Taiwan. The authors used a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear screening program as a base to integrate other screening regimens encompassing four other neoplastic diseases and three nonneoplastic chronic diseases. Screening methods, the interscreening interval, and the follow-up for each screening regimen were designed based on evidence-based literature and current national screening policy. RESULTS. A total of 42,387 subjects participated in the screening activities. A 25% increase in the attendance rate for Pap smear screening was demonstrated after the introduction of multiple disease screening programs. At the first screen, this program yielded a total of 677 asymptomatic neoplasms (16.0 per 1000), including a large proportion of precancerous lesions and small presymptomatic tumors without lymph node involvement. The association between the occurrence of neoplasm and the presence of comorbid nonneoplastic chronic disease was found to be statistically significant (odds ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-1.94 [P < 0.051). The authors also identified 5314 subjects with metabolic syndrome who were at a greater risk for colorectal and oral neoplasias. CONCLUSIONS. The results of the current study demonstrate that an outreach and community-based multiple screening program not only enhances attendance rates but also has a high yield of early cases of various diseases simultaneously, and provides a natural opportunity to elucidate the correlation between neoplastic disease and nonneoplastic chronic disease. © 2004 American Cancer Society.

18644385349	The LuxR family protein SpnR functions as a negative regulator of N-acylhomoserine lactone-dependent quorum sensing in Serratia marcescens	Serratia marcescens SS-1 produces at least four N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) which were identified using high-resolution mass spectrometry and chemical synthesis, as N-(3-oxohexanoyl) homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL), N-hexanoyl- (C6-HSL), N-heptanoyl (C7-HSL) and N-octanoyl- (C8-HSL) homoserine lactone. These AHLs are synthesized via the LuxI homologue SpnI, and regulate via the LuxR homologue SpnR, the production of the red pigment, prodigiosin, the nuclease, NucA, and a biosurfactant which facilitates surface translocation. spnR overexpression and spnR gene deletion show that SpnR, in contrast to most LuxR homologues, acts as a negative regulator. spnI overexpression, the provision of exogenous AHLs and spnI gene deletion suggest that SpnR is de-repressed by 3-oxo-C6-HSL. In addition, long chain AHLs antagonize the biosurfactant-mediated surface translocation of S. marcescens SS-1. Upstream of spnI there is a gene which we have termed spnT. spnI and spnT form an operon and although database searches failed to reveal any spnT homologues, overexpression of this novel gene negatively affected both sliding motility and prodigiosin production.

20944436886	The RssAB two-component signal transduction system in Serratia marcescens regulates swarming motility and cell envelope architecture in response to exogenous saturated fatty acids	Serratia marcescens swarms at 30°C but not at 37°C on a nutrient-rich (LB) agar surface. Mini-Tn5 mutagenesis of S. marcescens CH-1 yielded a mutant (WC100) that swarms not only vigorously at 37°C but also earlier and faster than the parent strain swarms at 30°C. Analysis of this mutant revealed that the transposon was inserted into a gene (rssA) predicted to encode a bacterial two-component signal transduction sensor kinase, upstream of which a potential response regulator gene (rssB) was located. rssA and rssB insertion-deletion mutants were constructed through homologous recombination, and the two mutants exhibited similar swarming phenotypes on LB swarming agar, in which swarming not only occurred at 37°C but also initiated at a lower cell density, on a surface with a higher agar concentration, and more rapidly than the swarming of the parent strain at 30°C. Both mutants also exhibited increased hemolysin activity and altered cell surface topologies compared with the parent CH-1 strain. Temperature and certain saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were found to negatively regulate S. marcescens swarming via the action of RssA-RssB. Analysis of the fatty acid profiles of the parent and the rssA and rssB mutants grown at 30°C or 37°C and under different nutrition conditions revealed a relationship between cellular fatty acid composition and swarming phenotypes. The cellular fatty acid profile was also observed to be affected by RssA and RssB. SFA-dependent inhibition of swarming was also observed in Proteus mirabilis, suggesting that either SFAs per se or the modulation of cellular fatty acid composition and hence homeostasis of membrane fluidity may be a conserved mechanism for regulating swarming motility in gram-negative bacteria.

0031855746	A swarming-defective mutant of Proteus mirabilis lacking a putative cation-transporting membrane P-type ATPase	The motile TnphoA mutant IC24 of Proteus mirabilis U6450 generates an aberrant swarming colony, and was shown to be impaired in swarm cell differentiation, i.e. cell elongation and hyperflagellation, causing delayed and slower population migration across a solid growth medium. Levels of transcript from the flagellin filament gene fliC, the flagellar master operon flhDC, and the leucine-responsive regulatory protein gene lrp, a regulator of swarming differentiation, were reduced in IC24 mutant swarm cells. The transposon had inserted into a gene encoding a putative P-type ATPase closely related to those transporting cations across bacterial membranes. This ppa gene (Proteus P-type ATPase) was maximally expressed in differentiated swarm cells. The data suggest an effect of ion homeostasis on swarm cell differentiation, possibly mediated via the lrp-flhDC pathway.

0031584844	Effect of glucose concentration on swimming motility in Enterobacteria	Since the observation that glucose prevents the synthesis of flagella in Escherichia coli was first reported in 1967, many studies have addressed the underlying mechanism. Currently, it is thought that an increase in glucose concentration decreases the intracellular CRP/cAMP concentration. This leads to an inhibitory effect on the expression of the flhD operon, the master operon for flagella synthesis. In our study on defining factors influencing the cell differentiation of Serratia marcescens, glucose catabolite repression of hag expression and swimming/swarming motility was not observed. Further experiments using a simple swimming motility assay extended this observation to other members of Enterobacteriaceae. Although the underlying mechanism is still uncharacterised, our results suggest that glucose catabolite repression of swimming motility may not be a common phenomenon in Enterobacteriaceae.

0032544325	Use of fluorescein labelled antibody and fluorescence activated cell sorter for rapid identification of mycobacterium species	A fluorescein labelled antibody (Ab)/Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS)-based assay was developed for detection of a wide range of mycobacterial species directly from bacterial culture and sputum specimens. The whole process could be completed within 3 hours and had a high specificity and sensitivity for cultured bacteria. The method was also shown to be applicable for direct identification from clinical specimens. This study showed that pretesting of clinical specimens for mycobacteria to the genus level with an antibody to mycobacterium species offers the routine clinical laboratory a single convenient test for the detection of tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria. Depending on the availability of species-specific antibody, the identification of Mycobacterium to the species level can be achieved.

23644441143	Biochemical characterization of RssA-RssB, a two-component signal transduction system regulating swarming behavior in Serratia marcescens	Our previous study had identified a pair of potential two-component signal transduction proteins, RssA-RssB, involved in the regulation of Serratia marcescens swarming. When mutated, both rssA and rssB mutants showed precocious swarming phenotypes on LB swarming agar, whereby swarming not only occurred at 37°C but also initiated on a surface of higher agar concentration and more rapidly than did the parent strain at 30°C. In this study, we further show that the predicted sensor kinase RssA and the response regulator RssB bear characteristics of components of the phosphorelay signaling system. In vitro phosphorylation and site-directed mutagenesis assays showed that phosphorylated RssA transfers the phosphate group to RssB and that histidine 248 and aspartate 51 are essential amino acid residues involved in the phosphotransfer reactions in RssA and RssB, respectively. Accordingly, while wild-type rssA could, the mutated rssA (H248A) in trans could not complement the precocious swarming phenotype of the rssA mutant. Although RssA-RssB regulates expressions of shlA and ygfF of S. marcescens (ygfF

23944431508	Characterization of the dapA-nlpB genetic locus involved in regulation of swarming motility, cell envelope architecture, hemolysin production, and cell attachment ability in Serratia marcescens	Swarming migration of Serratia marcescens requires both flagellar motility and cellular differentiation and is a population-density-dependent behavior. While the flhDC and quorum-sensing systems have been characterized as important factors regulating S. marcescens swarming, the underlying molecular mechanisms are currently far from being understood. Serratia swarming is thermoregulated and is characterized by continuous surface migration on rich swarming agar surfaces at 30°C but not at 37°C. To further elucidate the mechanisms, identification of specific and conserved regulators that govern the initiation of swarming is essential. We performed transposon mutagenesis to screen for S. marcescens strain CH-1 mutants that swarmed at 37°C. Analysis of a "precocious-swarming" mutant revealed that the defect in a conserved dapA

32444450157	A mobile quorum-sensing system in Serratia marcescens	Quorum-sensing systems that have been widely identified in bacteria play important roles in the regulation of bacterial multicellular behavior by which bacteria sense population density to control various biological functions, including virulence. One characteristic of the luxIR quorum-sensing genes is their diverse and discontinuous distribution among proteobacteria. Here we report that the spnIR quorum-sensing system identified in the enterobacterium Serratia marcescens strain SS-1 is carried in a transposon, TnTIR, which has common characteristics of Tn3 family transposons and is mobile between chromosomes and plasmids of different enterobacterial hosts. SpnIR functions in the new host and was shown to negatively regulate the TnTIR transposition frequency. This finding may help reveal the horizontal transfer and evolutionary mechanism of quorum-sensing genes and alter the way that we perceive regulation of bacterial multicellular behavior.

33646930358	Development of an improved PCR-ICT hybrid assay for direct detection of Legionellae and Legionella pneumophila from cooling tower water specimens	A novelly improved polymerase chian reaction and immunochromatography test (PCR-ICT) hybrid assay comprising traditional multiplex-nested PCR and ICT, (a lateral-flow device) was developed for direct detection of Legionella bacteria from environmental cooling tower samples. The partial 16S rDNA (specific for Legionella spp.) and dnaJ (specific for Legionella pneumophila) genes from Legionella chromosome were first specifically amplified by multiplex-nested PCR, respectively, followed by detection using ICT strip. Reading of results was based on presence or absence of the two test lines on the strips. Presence of test line 1 indicated existence of Legionella spp. specific 16S rDNA and identified Legionella spp. Presence of test line 2 further indicated existence of dnaJ and thus specifically identified L. pneumophila. In contrast, for non-Legionellae bacteria no test line formation was observed. Results of direct detection of Legionella bacteria and L. pneumophila from water tower specimens by this assay showed 100% sensitivity, and 96.6% and 100% specificity, respectively compared with traditional culture, biochemical and serological identification methods. The PCR-ICT hybrid assay does not require sophisticated equipment and was proved to be practically useful in rapid and direct Legionellae detection from environmental water samples. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33745968720	Direct and Simultaneous Identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) by Rapid Multiplex nested PCR-ICT assay	The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) shows different virulence and host infection range from other members of the M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Differential identification of MTB from MTBC is thus important in certain occasions. The currently commercially available molecular assays which use either IS6110 or 16S rDNA fragment as identification targets are mainly designed for identifying MTBC but not for MTB. Comparative genomic DNA analysis has provided valuable information on regions of difference (RD) present in MTB but not in other members of the MTBC. RD9 region is further suggested to be a potential target for differential identification of MTB from MTBC. In this study, using IS6110 and Rv3618 (belong to RD9) as the specific identification targets for MTBC and MTB, respectively, we developed and tested a multiplex nested PCR-ICT (immuno-chromatography test) assay for simultaneously and directly detecting not only MTBC but also MTB from 1500 clinical sputum specimens. The results were compared with traditional culture and biochemical identification results together with patients' clinical assessments. This assay showed a 95.5% sensitivity, 97.9% specificity, 2.1% false positive rate and 4.5% false negative rate towards detection of MTBC, and a 93.0% sensitivity, 99.8% specificity, 0.2% false positive rate and 7.0% false negative rate for detection of MTB. This detection system shows great potential in clinical application. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33746659829	Cost-effectiveness analysis of colorectal cancer screening with stool DNA testing in intermediate-incidence countries	Background: The aim of this study is to compare the cost-effectiveness of screening with stool DNA testing with that of screening with other tools (annual fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, and colonoscopy every 10 years) or not screening at all. Methods: We developed a Markov model to evaluate the above screening strategies in the general population 50 to 75 years of age in Taiwan. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of various parameters on the cost-effectiveness of screening. A third-party payer perspective was adopted and the cost of $13,000 per life-year saved (which is roughly the per capita GNP of Taiwan in 2003) was chosen as the ceiling ratio for assessing whether the program is cost-effective. Results: Stool DNA testing every three, five, and ten years can reduce colorectal cancer mortality by 22%, 15%, and 9%, respectively. The associated incremental costs were $9,794, $9,335, and $7,717, per life-year saved when compared with no screening. Stool DNA testing strategies were the least cost-effective with the cost per stool DNA test, referral rate with diagnostic colonoscopy, prevalence of large adenoma, and discount rate being the most influential parameters. Conclusion: In countries with a low or intermediate incidence of colorectal cancer, stool DNA testing is less cost-effective than the other currently recommended strategies for population-based screening, particularly targeting at asymptomatic subjects. © 2006 Wu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

33747200892	Regulatory roles of spnT, a novel gene located within transposon TnTIR	The transposon TnTIR contains spnIR quorum-sensing system regulating sliding motility and the production of nuclease, biosurfactant, and prodigiosin in Serratia marcescens. Within TnTIR, a gene named spnT is upstream of and co-transcribed with spnI. SpnT is a cytoplasmic protein and its level peaks during early stationary phase. spnT over-expression resulted in inhibition of sliding motility and synthesis of prodigiosin, and biosurfactant similar to spnR. spnT but not spnR over-expression induced cell elongation and aberrant DNA replication in S. marcescens and Escherichia coli strains. In comparison with wild-type E. coli strain, over-expression of spnT in an E. coli priA and dnaC double-mutant strain did not lead to the aberrant cell morphology phenotypes, suggesting SpnT may act through the recombination-dependent DNA replication system. As spnT over-expression inhibited swarming but not swimming motility, SpnT may indirectly function as a negative regulator of surface-dependent migration and secondary metabolite production. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

34447542068	Fluoroquinolone resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates: Associated genetic mutations and relationship to antimicrobial exposure	Objectives: We assessed the fluoroquinolone (FQ) susceptibility of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in an endemic area. The genetic mutations responsible for FQ resistance were also evaluated. Methods: A total of 420 M. tuberculosis isolates during January 2004 to December 2005 were randomly selected. Data on the clinical characteristics of the patients were obtained from medical records. The MICs of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined. Spoligotyping and sequencing of the gyrA and gyrB genes were performed for all isolates resistant to any tested FQ. Results: Of the 420 isolates, 52 (12.4%), 26 (6.2%), 26 (6.2%) and 30 (7.1%) were resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin, respectively. Multidrug resistance was found in 5.0% of isolates. For all tested FQs, the susceptibility rate was higher than 97%. Resistance to any first-line drug and isolation from a patient with prior anti-tuberculous treatment were correlated with FQ resistance. Multidrug resistance had the strongest correlation with FQ resistance (19% of isolates). Neither the previous use of FQs nor the duration of FQ exposure was correlated with the FQ susceptibility. Of the 14 FQ-resistant isolates, five (35.7%) had gyrA mutations (four D94G and one A90V) and another one (7.1%) had a gyrB mutation (N538D). Conclusions: This study found FQ resistance in 3.3% of all clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. FQ resistance was correlated with first-line drug resistance and prior anti-tuberculous treatment, suggesting the need for routine FQ susceptibility testing in patients with these characteristics.

36549051565	Performance assessment of the Capilia TB assay and the BD ProbeTec ET system for rapid culture confirmation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Because of the increasing numbers of nontuberculous mycobacterial isolates from clinical specimens, rapid and accurate methods for culture confirmation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are urgently needed. The study evaluated the performance of the Capilia TB immunochromatographic assay (TAUNS, Numazu, Japan) for culture confirmation of M. tuberculosis using 242 culture-positive liquid media in 2 mycobacterial laboratories from November 2005 to February 2006. Among the 242 samples, 183 were also tested with the BD ProbeTec ET (CTB) assay (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD). The results of both assays were compared to the culture results and to each other. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the Capilia TB assay were 98.6% and 97.9%, respectively, and for the CTB assay were 97.3% and 97.1%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values for the Capilia TB assay were 98.6% and 97.9%, respectively, and for the CTB assay were 98.2% and 95.8%, respectively. Among the 183 samples tested with both assays, 8 had discrepant results, including Capilia-TB-false-positive in 2, CTB-false-positive in another 2, CTB-false-negative in 2, Capilia TB-false-negative in 1, and both assays with false-negative results in the remaining one. This study demonstrated that the Capilia TB assay has a similar diagnostic value with the CTB assay. In addition, with the immunochromatographic method, it is less time-consuming and does not require other laboratory equipment. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

35648972746	The bacterial metabolite 2,3-butanediol ameliorates endotoxin-induced acute lung injury in rats	Widely identified in bacteria, yeasts and human beings, 2,3-butanediol has been studied for decades.This chemical reportedly functions as a neutralization agent to counteract lethal acidification by bacterial growth and as a signaling molecule involved in interactions among insects, and between bacteria and the plant host. While 2,3-butanediol is produced by many pathogenic bacterial species, its significance and effect on mammals remains basically uncharacterized. Herein, we show that gastric intubation of 2,3-butanediol in rats significantly ameliorates acute lung injury (ALI) and the inflammatory responses induced by the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), with an efficacy comparable to that of the polyphenol compound resveratrol. Such effect was further demonstrated to occur via modulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. These results indicate that bacterial metabolite, 2,3-butanediol has a negative regulatory effect on host innate immunity response, suggesting bacteria may use some metabolites for host immune evasion. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

36849036302	Cost-effectiveness analysis for determining optimal cut-off of immunochemical faecal occult blood test for population-based colorectal cancer screening (KCIS 16)	Objectives: We aimed to determine the optimal cut-off of the immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) by using cost-effectiveness analysis. Methods A total of 22,672 subjects aged 50 years or older were invited to have an uptake of iFOBT. We collected data from screen-detected cases for the cut-off above 100 ng/mL and obtained interval cancers from a nationwide cancer registry for a cut-off below 100 ng/mL. We found a total of 65 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, including 43 detected by screen and 22 diagnosed between screens (interval cases). The optimal cut-off was first determined by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. Formal economic evaluation was further applied to identifying the optimal cut-off by assessing the minimum incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), an indicator for cost per life year gained (effectiveness), given a series of cut-offs of iFOBT, ranging from 30 to 200 ng/mL compared with no screening. Results: ROC curve analysis found the optimal cut-off of iFOBT to be 100 ng/mL at which the sensitivity, false-positive and odds of being affected given a positive result were 81.5% (70.2%-89.2%), 5.7% (5.4%-6.0%) and 1.24 (1.19-1.32), respectively. The area under ROC curve was 0.87 (0.81-0.93). In economic appraisal, the screening programme irrespective of any cut-off dominated (less cost and more effectiveness) over the control group. The optimal cut-off (the lowest ICER) was 110 ng/mL at which an average of 0.054 life year was gained and that of 950 ($US) was saved. Conclusions: We used cost-effectiveness to identify 110 ng/mL as the optimal cut-off of iFOBT in a Taiwanese population-based screening for CRC. Our model provides a useful approach for health policy-makers in designing population-based screening for CRC to determine the optimal cut-off of iFOBT when cost and effectiveness need to be taken into account.

0033768776	Role of flhDC in the expression of the nuclease gene nucA, cell division and flagellar synthesis in Serratia marcescens	We investigated in Serratia marcescens the functions of the flhDC operon, which controls motility and cell division in enteric bacteria. Included in our evaluations were investigation of cell division, flagellar synthesis and regulation of the expression of nuclease (encoded by the nucA(Sm) gene, one of the virulence factors). Interruption of the chromosomal flhDC operon in S. marcescens CH-1 resulted in aberrant cell division and loss of nuclease and flagella. Expression of nucA(Sm) and other mutated phenotypes was restored in the flhDC mutant by the induction of overexpression of flhDC in a multicopy plasmid. Multi-copied flhDC also induced the formation of differentiated cells (polyploid aseptate cells with oversynthesis of peritrichous flagella) in broth culture using minimal growth medium. Expression of the flhDC operon showed positive autoregulation, and was growth phase dependent (upregulated in early log phase). In addition, flhDC expression was inhibited when the temperature increased from 30 to 37°C, and when osmolarity was increased, but was not influenced by glucose catabolite repression. These results show that FlhD/FlhC is a multifunctional transcriptional activator involved in the process of cell differentiation, swarming and virulence factor expression.

0033887012	Inhibition of virulence factor expression and swarming differentiation in Proteus mirabilis by p-nitrophenylglycerol	Proteus mirabilis is a common cause of upper urinary tract infections that can involve invasion of host urothelial cells. The ability to invade urothelial cells is coupled closely to swarming, a form of multicellular behaviour in which vegetative bacteria differentiate into hyperflagellate, filamentous swarming cells capable of co-ordinated and rapid population migration. Co-ordinate expression of virulence factors including urease, protease, haemolysin and flagellin during swarm-cell differentiation in P. mirabilis has been reported. To investigate the effects of p-nitrophenylglycerol (PNPG), a potent anti-swarming agent, on the various swarming-associated traits of P. mirabilis and to elucidate the relationships among them, P. mirabilis growth rate, swarming/swimming activity, cell invasion ability and the ability to express various virulence factors were monitored in the presence or absence of PNPG. It was found that PNPG could inhibit the growth rate, swarming differentiation and swarming/swimming activities of P. mirabilis. The expression of virulence factors such as protease, urease, haemolysin and flagellin in P. mirabilis was also inhibited by PNPG. The ability of P. mirabilis to invade human urothelial cells was reduced dramatically in the presence of PNPG. These results suggest that PNPG has the potential to be developed as an agent active against the effects of P. mirabilis infection.

33644865645	N-Acylhomoserine lactone-dependent cell-to-cell communication and social behavior in the genus Serratia	Members of the genus Serratia are increasingly responsible for nosocomial infections, the treatment of which may be complicated by the appearance of multi-antibiotic-resistant strains. Some but not all Serratia strains and species produce N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs), and possess luxR and luxI homologous genes. Phylogenetic comparisons have provided evidence for the lateral transfer of these quorum-sensing systems, and in at least one strain of S. marcescens, transfer via a complex transposon has been experimentally demonstrated. AHL-dependent quorum sensing in Serratia controls population surface migration, biofilm development, the biosynthesis of a carbapenem antibiotic and production of the red pigment, prodigiosin. Serratia also possesses LuxS and produces autoinducer-2 (AI-2) which appears to function as a second quorum-sensing system controlling many of the same phenotypes as the LuxR/AHL systems. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

84861760572	Amplified surface plasmon resonance immunosensor for interferon-Gamma based on a streptavidin-incorporated aptamer	Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis, which is a major public health problem worldwide. Although significant progress has been made with regard to the design of enzyme immunoassays for IFN-γ, this assay is still labor-intensive and time-consuming. We therefore designed a DNA aptamer hairpin structure for the detection of IFN-γ with high sensitivity and selectivity. A streptavidin DNA aptamer was incorporated into the IFN-γ binding aptamer probe for the amplified detection of the target molecules. Initially, the probe remained in the inactive configuration. The addition of IFN-γ induced the rearrangement of the aptamer structure, allowing the self-assembly of the active streptavidin aptamer conformation for the streptavidin molecular recognition. Under optimized conditions, the detection limit was determined to be 33. pM, with a dynamic range from 0.3 to 333. nM, both of which were superior to those of corresponding optical sensors. Because combined aptamers are composed of nucleic acids, this optical aptasensor provided the advantages of high sensitivity, simplicity, reusability, and no further labeling or sample pre-treatment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A precocious swarming mutant S. marcescens O6 whose rssC is interrupted by mini-Tn5 transposon was obtained. The 364 amino-acid RssC showed a high identity to members of acyltransferase family. Characterization of the rssC knock-out mutant S. marcescens PC105 showed aberrant and hypervirulent phenotypes including precocious swarming behavior, reduced cell attachment ability and increase in swimming motility, flagellin synthesis, capsular polysaccharide (CPS) production, hemolysin activity, and cytotoxicity activity. Besides a more intense pattern of O-antigen sugar unit ladder, S. marcescens PC105 also showed an altered cell surface topology. A potential FlhDC binding site was identified at the rssC promoter region. In accordance, rssC transcriptional activity was up-regulated by FlhDC

44449093701	Resveratrol ameliorates Serratia marcescens-induced acute pneumonia in rats	Serratia marcescens is an important nosocomial pathogen, which has been especially problematic as a cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia in the past two decades. Treatment of S. marcescens-related infections has been limited by emergence of multiple drug-resistant strains. Thus, the development of alternative agents for the prevention and treatment of Serratia infection is urgently needed. Resveratrol (RSV) is a compound with diverse biological effects including anti-cancer, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetes, and cancer chemoprevention. Whether RSV has in vivo prophylactic or therapeutic potential against infection remains uncharacterized. In the present study, we used a murine acute pneumonia model initiated by intratracheal application of S. marcescens to evaluate whether RSV possesses anti-infection properties. We showed that pretreatment with RSV for 3 days markedly increased alveolar macrophage infiltration, elevated NK cell activity, and decreased bacterial burden in the infected lung with a subsequent decrease in mortality. These effects were associated with significantly less-severe inflammatory phenotypes in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, including reduced neutrophil infiltration of the lungs, reduced phagocytosis activity, and reduced secretion of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. To further characterize the underlying mechanism responsible for these effects of RSV, LPS derived from S. marcescens was used to induce acute pneumonia in rats, with or without RSV pretreatment. RSV was shown to ameliorate acute pneumonia via inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway, including inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent NF-κB activation. These findings suggest that RSV might be beneficial as a prophylactic treatment in patients at risk of an episode of S. marcescens-induced acute pneumonia. © Society for Leukocyte Biology.

56049116286	Rapid identification of mycobacteria from smear-positive sputum samples by nested PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis	The rapid identification of mycobacteria from smear-positive sputum samples is an important clinical issue. Furthermore, the availability of a cheap, technically simple, and accurate method also would benefit mycobacterial laboratories in developing countries. In the present study, we aimed to develop an assay allowing the identification of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and other frequently isolated nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) directly from smear-positive sputum samples. A nested PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (nested-PRA) assay that focuses on the analysis of the hsp65 gene was developed and evaluated for its efficiency compared to that of traditional culture methods and 16S rRNA gene sequencing identification. A total of 204 smear-positive and culture-positive sputum specimens were prospectively collected for analysis between November 2005 and May 2006. The samples were classified according to an acid-fast bacillus (AFB) staining scale as rare/1+, 2+, or 3+. The results of the nested-PRA showed that the identification rate for AFB 3+, AFB 2+, and AFB rare/1+ samples was 100, 95, and 53%, respectively, and that the overall identification rate was 89%. All positive results by the nested-PRA method agreed with the results by culture and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The nested-PRA appears to have clinical applicability when used for the direct identification of mycobacterial organisms (both MTBC and NTM) that are present in smear-positive sputum samples, especially for countries in which MTBC is endemic.

5444250899	Performance assessment of a nested-PCR assay (the RAPID BAP-MTB) and the BD ProbeTec ET system for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical specimens	The performance of a nested PCR-based assay (the RAPID BAP-MTB; AsiaGen, Taichung, Taiwan) and the BD ProbeTec ET (DTB) system (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, Md.) for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was evaluated with 600 consecutive clinical samples. These samples, including 552 respiratory specimens and 48 nonrespiratory specimens, were collected from 333 patients treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from September to October 2003. The results of both assays were compared to the gold standard of combined culture results and clinical diagnosis. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAPID BAP-MTB assay for respiratory specimens were 66.7% and 97.2%, respectively, and for the DTB assay they were 56.7% and 95.3%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values for the RAPID BAP-MTB were 74.1% and 96.0%, respectively, and for the DTB assay they were 59.6% and 94.7%, respectively. For smear-negative samples, the sensitivity of the RAPID BAP-MTB and DTB assays was 57.1% and 40.5%, respectively. The RAPID BAP-MTB assay produced 14 false-positive results in 14 samples, including one of the six samples yielding Mycobacterium abscessus, one of the six samples yielding Mycobacterium avium intracellulare, one sample from a patient with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis with complete treatment, and three samples from three patients with a previous diagnosis of tuberculosis who were under treatment at the time of specimen collection. Among the 48 nonrespiratory specimens, the RAPID BAP-MTB assay was positive in one biopsy sample from a patient with lumbar tuberculous spondylitis and one pus sample from a patient with tuberculous cervical lymphatlenopathy. Our results showed that the RAPID BAP-MTB assay is better than the DTB assay for both respiratory specimens and nonrespiratory specimens. The overall time for processing this assay is only 5 h. In addition, its diagnostic accuracy in smear-negative samples is as high as in smear-positive samples.

62749171844	Nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary infection in medical intensive care unit: The incidence, patient characteristics, and clinical significance	Background: The clinical significance of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) pulmonary infection in medical intensive care unit (ICU) is still unclear. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective study in the medical ICUs of a medical center in Taiwan from January 1999 to June 2007. Patients with NTM isolated from respiratory specimens within 1 month before or during the ICU course were identified. Those who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of NTM pulmonary infection were identified and compared with patients with NTM colonization and control subjects who were culture-negative for mycobacteria. Results: Among the 5,378 patients admitted to medical ICUs, 2,866 (53.3%) had received mycobacterial culture for respiratory specimens. NTM were isolated from 169 (5.8%) patients. Of them, 47 (27.8%) were considered NTM pulmonary infection. M. avium complex and M. abscessus were the most common pathogens. Within 100 days after ICU admission, significantly more patients with NTM infection died than those with NTM colonization and control subjects (47 vs. 8 vs. 14%, P < 0.001). Twenty-one (49%) patients with NTM pulmonary infection received anti-NTM treatment, with four experiencing adverse effects. Although statistically insignificant, anti-NTM treatment was associated with prolonged survival for those who died in the ICU and shorter ICU stay for those who survived the ICU course. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that NTM pulmonary infection seems to associate with higher mortality in medical ICUs. Anti-NTM treatment is probably associated with a better outcome. Therefore, keeping a high suspicion when NTM is isolated and using careful consideration when starting anti-NTM treatment should be emphasized. © The Author(s) 2008.

67849115982	A simple gold nanoparticle probes assay for identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from clinical specimens	We had previously developed a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-immunochromatography test (ICT) for identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and differentiation of MTB from other members of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) from clinical sputum samples (Soo P.C. et al., Journal of Microbiological Methods. 2006, 66(3):440-8.). To further improve the detection flexibility, simplicity and efficiency, and reduce the cost, in this study, an alternative molecular diagnosis assay that utilizes gold nanoparticles derivatized with thiol modified oligonucleotides was developed. The gold nanoparticles probes, GP-1/GP-2 for IS6110 and GP-3/GP-4 for Rv3618, were designed to specifically hybridize with target DNAs of MTBC and MTB strains, respectively. Efficacy of the gold nanoparticle probes assay was evaluated by directly and simultaneously detecting not only MTBC but also MTB from 600 clinical sputum specimens. Results were compared with traditional culture and biochemical identification methods together with patients' clinical assessments. This assay showed a 96.6% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity towards detection of MTBC, and a 94.7% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity for detection of MTB. In conclusion, the gold nanoparticle probes assay is a simple, rapid, cost-effective and accurate detection system and shows great potential in clinical application of MTBC and MTB detection, especially in developing countries. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

69049090937	Clinical manifestations, antibiotic susceptibility and molecular analysis of Mycobacterium kansasii isolates from a university hospital in Taiwan	Objectives: Mycobacterium kansasii causes a variety of infections. Although previous reports on the prognosis of antimicrobial therapy have been mostly satisfactory, problems involving treatment failure or relapse have been encountered. The purpose of this study was to establish a relationship between the clinical treatment outcomes of M. kansasii infections and bacterial drug susceptibility, and their clonality. Methods: A total of 37 M. kansasii clinical isolates and clinical information on 34 patients were retrospectively collected in a tertiary medical centre in Taiwan. Bacterial drug susceptibility was determined by the microdilution method. The phylogenetic relationship was analysed by PFGE analysis. Results: Results of PFGE typing revealed a major cluster (cluster I) and eight other divergent patterns. Two/three strains leading to treatment failure were also multidrug resistant and belonged to cluster I. Conclusions: A relationship between high drug resistance and genetic relatedness of some M. kansasii strains was established. This was associated with clinical treatment failure. © The Author 2009.

77952102560	The RssB/RssA two-component system regulates biosynthesis of the tripyrrole antibiotic, prodigiosin, in Serratia marcescens	Serratia marcescens CH-1 produces a red, cell-associated pigment, prodigiosin, synthesized by enzymes encoded in the pig operon. The underlying regulatory mechanism, especially its relationship with the RssAB two-component system signaling, remained uncharacterized. Here, we show that phosphorylated RssB (RssB-P) directly binds to the promoter region of the pig operon (pigA promoter), as observed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Furthermore, we identify the RssB-P binding site located downstream of the -10 and -35 regions in pigA using a DNase I footprinting assay. A compilation of the RssB-P binding sites in flhDC, rssB and pigA promoter regions reveals the presence of a conserved core sequence, GAGATTTTAGCTAAATTAATBTTT (B=C, G, or T), which we believe is the RssB binding sequence. Site-specific mutation of conserved nucleotides within the conserved RssB binding sequence in the pigA promoter region leads to absence of retardation in the presence of RssB-P in vitro and elevated transcription of pigA in vivo. These data suggest that RssAB signaling negatively regulates prodigiosin production, and such inhibition is mediated through direct and specific repression of transcriptional activity of the pig operon. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

78049442087	RssAB-FlhDC-ShlBA as a major pathogenesis pathway in Serratia marcescens	Serratia marcescens has long been recognized as an important opportunistic pathogen, but the underlying pathogenesis mechanism is not completely clear. Here, we report a key pathogenesis pathway in S. marcescens comprising the RssAB two-component system and its downstream elements, FlhDC and the dominant virulence factor hemolysin ShlBA. Expression of shlBA is under the positive control of FlhDC, which is repressed by RssAB signaling. At 37°C, functional RssAB inhibits swarming, represses hemolysin production, and promotes S. marcescens biofilm formation. In comparison, when rssBA is deleted, S. marcescens displays aberrant multicellularity favoring motile swarming with unbridled hemolysin production. Cellular and animal infection models further demonstrate that loss of rssBA transforms this opportunistic pathogen into hypervirulent phenotypes, leading to extensive inflammatory responses coupled with destructive and systemic infection. Hemolysin production is essential in this context. Collectively, a major virulence regulatory pathway is identified in S. marcescens. Copyright © 2010, American Society for Microbiology.

78650630361	Resveratrol induces apoptosis of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells via activation of multiple apoptotic pathways	Resveratrol, a naturally occurring dietary compound with chemopreventive properties has been reported to trigger a variety of cancer cell types to apoptosis. Whether resveratrol shows any activity on human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells remained to be determined. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of resveratrol on human NPC cells. Treatment of resveratrol resulted in significant decrease in cell viability of NPC cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A dose-dependent apoptotic cell death was also measured by flow cytometery analysis. Molecular mechanistic studies of apoptosis unraveled resveratrol treatment resulted in a significant loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c, enhanced expression of Fas ligand (FasL), and suppression of glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78). These were followed by activation of caspases-9, -8, -4, and -3, subsequently leading to DNA fragmentation and cell apoptosis. Furthermore, up-regulation of proapoptotic Bax and down-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein were also observed. Taken together, resveratrol induces apoptosis in human NPC cells through regulation of multiple apoptotic pathways, including death receptor, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Resveratrol can be developed as an effective compound for human NPC treatment. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

79451470875	Unraveling the role of the rssC gene of serratia marcescens by atomic force microscopy	The product and direct role of the rssC gene of Serratia marcescens is unknown. For unraveling the role of the rssC gene, atomic force microscopy has been used to identify the surfaces of intact S. marcescens wild-type CH-1 cells and rssC mutant CH-1C cells. The detailed surface topographies were directly visualized, and quantitative measurements of the physical properties of the membrane structures were provided. CH-1 and CH-1C cells were observed before and after treatment with lysozyme, and their topography-related parameters, e.g., a valley-to-peak distance, mean height, surface roughness, and surface root-mean-square values, were defined and compared. The data obtained suggest that the cellular surface topography of mutant CH-1C becomes rougher and more precipitous than that of wild-type CH-1 cells. Moreover, it was found that, compared with native wild-type CH-1, the cellular surface topography of lysozyme-treated CH-1 was not changed profoundly. The product of the rssC gene is thus predicted to be mainly responsible for fatty-acid biosynthesis of the S. marcescens outer membrane. This study represents the first direct observation of the structural changes in membranes of bacterial mutant cells and offers a new prospect for predicting gene expression in bacterial cells. © Microscopy Society of America 2010.

79954469049	Activation of multiple apoptotic pathways in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by the prenylated isoflavone, osajin	Osajin is a prenylated isoflavone showing antitumor activity in different tumor cell lines. The underlying mechanism of osajin-induced cancer cell death is not clearly understood. In the present study, the mechanisms of osajin-induced cell death of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells were explored. Osajin was found to significantly induce apoptosis of NPC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Multiple molecular effects were observed during osajin treatment including a significant loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, enhanced expression of Fas ligand (FasL), suppression of glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78), and activation of caspases-9, -8, -4 and -3. In addition, up-regulation of proapoptotic Bax protein and down-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein were also observed. Taken together, osajin induces apoptosis in human NPC cells through multiple apoptotic pathways, including the extrinsic death receptor pathway, and intrinsic pathways relying on mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Thus, osajin could be developed as a new effective and chemopreventive compound for human NPC. © 2011 Huang et al.

0036708302	groESL sequence determination, phylogenetic analysis, and species differentiation for viridans group streptococci	The full-length sequences of the groESL genes (also known as cpn10/60) of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groESL genes of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius were determined. The lengths of the groES genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groEL determined for 4 species (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, and S. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. The intergenic region (spacer) between the groES and groEL genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. The variation of the groES sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groEL sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). Phylogenetic analysis of the groES and groEL genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of the 16S rRNA gene. The intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. The groESL sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.

80052054441	RssAB signaling coordinates early development of surface multicellularity in serratia marcescens	Bacteria can coordinate several multicellular behaviors in response to environmental changes. Among these, swarming and biofilm formation have attracted significant attention for their correlation with bacterial pathogenicity. However, little is known about when and where the signaling occurs to trigger either swarming or biofilm formation. We have previously identified an RssAB two-component system involved in the regulation of swarming motility and biofilm formation in Serratia marcescens. Here we monitored the RssAB signaling status within single cells by tracing the location of the translational fusion protein EGFP-RssB following development of swarming or biofilm formation. RssAB signaling is specifically activated before surface migration in swarming development and during the early stage of biofilm formation. The activation results in the release of RssB from its cognate inner membrane sensor kinase, RssA, to the cytoplasm where the downstream gene promoters are located. Such dynamic localization of RssB requires phosphorylation of this regulator. By revealing the temporal activation of RssAB signaling following development of surface multicellular behavior, our findings contribute to an improved understanding of how bacteria coordinate their lifestyle on a surface. © 2011 Tsai et al.

80053196838	Use of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 in non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease	BACKGROUND: Serum biomarkers are rarely studied in patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease (NTM-LD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) and other inflammatory markers in NTM-LD. DESIGN: From April 2009 to March 2010, patients with NTM culture-positive respiratory specimens who were clinically and radiographically suspected of NTM-LD were evaluated for serum levels of sTREM-1, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and interferon-gamma. RESULTS: Of the 86 patients enrolled, 60 fulfilled the diagnosis of NTM-LD. Using the receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis, serum sTREM-1 had the highest discriminative power for NTM-LD and colonisation (area under the curve = 0.714). Using a cut-off value of 180 pg/ml, the sensitivity and specificity of sTREM-1 were respectively 58% and 89%. Logistic regression analysis revealed that Mycobacterium avium complex, M. kansasii, positive sputum acid-fast smear and higher serum sTREM-1 level were independent risk factors for NTM-LD. Age ≥65 years and higher serum sTREM-1 level were associated with worse 6-month survival. CONCLUSION: In patients with respiratory specimens that are culture-positive for NTM with clinical suspicion of NTM-LD, serum sTREM-1 level measurements may be helpful in diagnosing and predicting outcome for NTM-LD. © 2011 The Union.

84858342164	Direct identification of mycobacteria from smear-positive sputum samples using an improved multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay	The rapid identification of mycobacteria from smear-positive sputum samples is very important. To identify the . Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and frequently isolated nontuberculous mycobacteria strains directly from smear-positive sputum samples, an improved multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed. Nine pairs of primers targeting the 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer-1, . hsp65, and the early secretory antigen (ESAT-6) gene sequences were developed, and their efficacy was evaluated in comparison to traditional culturing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods. A total of 200 smear- and culture-positive sputum specimens collected between November 2005 and May 2006 were used for the analysis. The results of the assay showed an accurate identification rate for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) 3+, AFB 2+, and AFB rare/1+ samples of 98%, 95%, and 53%, respectively. The improved multiplex PCR method saves time and has advantages for identifying mycobacteria from AFB 2+ and 3+ sputum samples.

84859401101	Rapid identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection by a new array format-based surface plasmon resonance method	Tubercle bacillus [TB] is one of the most important chronic infectious diseases that cause millions of deaths annually. While conventional smear microscopy and culture methods are widely used for diagnosis of TB, the former is insensitive, and the latter takes up to 6 to 8 weeks to provide a result, limiting the value of these methods in aiding diagnosis and intermediate decisions on treatment. Therefore, a rapid detection method is essential for the diagnosis, prognosis assessment, and recurrence monitoring. A new surface plasmon resonance [SPR] biosensor based on an array format, which allowed immobilizing nine TB antigens onto the sensor chip, was constructed. Simultaneous determination of multiple TB antibodies in serum had been accomplished with this array-based SPR system. The results were compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, a conventional immunological method. Array-based SPR showed more advantages in providing label-free and real-time detection. Additionally, the high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of TB infection showed its potential for future development of biosensor arrays for TB diagnosis. © 2012 Hsieh et al.

84860491760	Activation of an NLRP3 inflammasome restricts mycobacterium kansasii infection	Mycobacterium kansasii has emerged as an important nontuberculous mycobacterium pathogen, whose incidence and prevalence have been increasing in the last decade. M. kansasii can cause pulmonary tuberculosis clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from that caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Unlike the widely-studied M. tuberculosis, little is known about the innate immune response against M. kansasii infection. Although inflammasome activation plays an important role in host defense against bacterial infection, its role against atypical mycobacteria remains poorly understood. In this report, the role of inflammasome activity in THP-1 macrophages against M. kansasii infection was studied. Results indicated that viable, but not heat-killed, M. kansasii induced caspase-1-dependent IL-1β secretion in macrophages. The underlying mechanism was found to be through activation of an inflammasome containing the NLR (Nod-like receptor) family member NLRP3 and the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD). Further, potassium efflux, lysosomal acidification, ROS production and cathepsin B release played a role in M. kansasii-induced inflammasome activation. Finally, the secreted IL-1β derived from caspase-1 activation was shown to restrict intracellular M. kansasii. These findings demonstrate a biological role for the NLRP3 inflammasome in host defense against M. kansasii. © 2012 Chen et al.

It is a novel Au-SAM-graphene nanocomposites and taking advantages of the striking properties of both graphene and Au film, fundamental understanding in hybrid material manipulation and new electrochemical properties can be obtained. The sensitivity of TB detection in the LAMP-based assay for the amplification of the Insertion Sequence 6110 (IS6110) samples was determined by a single-layer graphene/Au thin film and compared with that of a conventional Au/Cr-based SPR chips. The results show that a graphene/Au SPR offers a potentially powerful assay, with a highly sensitive analysis, that may be applicable as an important tool for bio-marker detection. © 2012 SPIE.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between treatment outcome and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. A total of 27 patients with M. marinum infections were enrolled. Methods: Data on clinical characteristics and therapeutic methods were collected and analyzed. We also determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 7 antibiotics against 30 isolates from these patients. Results: Twenty-seven patients received antimycobacterial agents with or without surgical debridement. Eighteen patients were cured, 8 failed to respond to treatment, and one was lost to follow-up. The duration of clarithromycin (147 vs. 28; p = 0.0297), and rifampicin (201 vs. 91; p = 0.0266) treatment in the cured patients was longer than that in the others. Surgical debridement was performed in 10 out of the 18 cured patients, and in 1 of another group (p = 0.0417). All the 30 isolates were susceptible to clarithromycin, amikacin, and linezolid; 29 (96.7%) were susceptible to ethambutol; 28 (93.3%) were susceptible to sulfamethoxazole; and 26 (86.7%) were susceptible to rifampicin. However, only 1 (3.3%) isolate was susceptible to doxycycline. Discussion: Early diagnosis of the infection and appropriate antimicrobial therapy with surgical debridement are the mainstays of successful treatment. Clarithromycin and rifampin are supposed to be more effective agents. © 2012 Wu et al.

84864186420	The anti-tumorigenic mushroom agaricus blazei murill enhances IL-1β production and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in human macrophages	Agaricus blazei Murill (AbM) has been reported to possess immune activity against tumors and infections through stimulation of mononuclear phagocytes. Recently, AbM extract was shown to induce the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), in human monocytes. IL-1β is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by activated macrophages and monocytes and its secretion is strictly controlled by the inflammasome. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of AbM water extracts on the regulation of IL-1β production and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in human THP-1 macrophages. The NLRP3 inflammasome consists of an NLRP3 receptor, an adaptor protein called ASC, and the inflammatory protease, caspase-1. Typically, stimulation of immune cells with microbial products results in production of pro-IL-1β, but a second stress-related signal activates the inflammasome and caspase-1, leading to processing and secretion of IL-1β. Our results show that AbM enhances transcription of IL-1β and triggers NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β secretion in human THP-1 macrophages. AbM-mediated IL-1β secretion was markedly reduced in macrophages deficient in NLRP3 and ASC, demonstrating that the NLRP3 inflammasome is essential for AbM-induced IL-1β secretion. In addition, caspase-1 was activated and involved in proteolytic cleavage and secretion of IL-1β in AbM-treated macrophages. AbM-mediated IL-1β secretion also decreased in cells treated with cathepsin B inhibitor, suggesting that AbM can induce the release of cathepsin B. Furthermore, our data show that AbM-induced inflammasome activation requires the release of ATP, binding of extracellular ATP to the purinergic receptor P2X

0037764104	High prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in rapidly growing mycobacteria in Taiwan	An increasing number of clinical isolations of rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) at the National Taiwan University Hospital were noted from 1992 to 2001. Broth microdilution MICs of 15 antimicrobial agents were determined for 200 clinical isolates of RGM, including the Mycobacterium fortuitum group (69 isolates), M. chelonae (39 isolates), and M. abscessus (92 isolates). Our results showed that the resistance rates of these isolates to the currently available agents were remarkably high. Amikacin was active against nearly all RGM isolates. Clarithromycin was usually active against M. abscessus (79% susceptibility) and the M. fortuitum group (65% susceptibility). The majority of M. fortuitum group isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin (62%) and imipenem (61%). The susceptibilities to other conventional anti-RGM agents of these isolates were poor but differed markedly by species. The newer fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gatifloxacin) and meropenem showed better in vitro activities against the M. fortuitum group isolates than against the other two species of RGM. Linezolid had fairly good activity against these RGM isolates, particularly against M. chelonae isolates (82% susceptible).

84868133551	Activation of NK cell cytotoxicity by the natural compound 2,3-butanediol	The natural compound 2,3-BTD has diverse physiological effects in a range of organisms, including acting as a detoxifying product of liver alcohol metabolism in humans and ameliorating endotoxin-induced acute lung injury in rats. In this study, we reveal that 2,3-BTD enhances NK cell cytotoxic activity in human pNK cells and NK92 cells. Treatment of NK cells with 2,3-BTD increased perforin expression in a dose-dependent manner. This was accompanied by elevated JNK and ERK1/2 MAPK activities and enhanced expression of NKG2D/ NCRs, upstream signaling molecules of the MAPK pathways. The 2,3-BTD effect was inhibited by pretreatment with inhibitors of JNK (SP) or ERK1/2 (PD) or by depleting NKG2D/NCRs or JNK1 or ERK2 with siRNA. These results indicate that 2,3-BTD activates NK cell cytotoxicity by NKG2D/NCR pathways and represent the first report of the 2,3-BTD effect on activation of innate immunity cells. © Society for Leukocyte Biology.

84875127115	Hirsutella sinensis mycelium suppresses interleukin-1β and interleukin-18 secretion by inhibiting both canonical and non-canonical inflammasomes	Cordyceps sinensis is a medicinal mushroom used for centuries in Asian countries as a health supplement and tonic. Hirsutella sinensis-the anamorphic, mycelial form of C. sinensis-possesses similar properties, and is increasingly used as a health supplement. Recently, C. sinensis extracts were shown to inhibit the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in lipopolysaccharide-treated macrophages. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this process has remained unclear. In addition, whether H. sinensis mycelium (HSM) extracts also inhibit the production of IL-1β has not been investigated. In the present study, the HSM extract suppresses IL-1β and IL-18 secretion, and ATP-induced activation of caspase-1. Notably, we observed that HSM not only reduced expression of the inflammasome component NLRP1 and the P2X 7 R but also reduced the activation of caspase-4, and ATP-induced ROS production. These findings reveal that the HSM extract has anti-inflammatory properties attributed to its ability to inhibit both canonical and non-canonical inflammasomes.

84879527865	Mab_3168c, a Putative Acetyltransferase, Enhances Adherence, Intracellular Survival and Antimicrobial Resistance of Mycobacterium abscessus	Mycobacterium abscessus is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium. It can cause diseases in both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients and is highly resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. M. abscessus displays two different colony morphology types: smooth and rough morphotypes. Cells with a rough morphotype are more virulent. The purpose of this study was to identify genes responsible for M. abscessus morphotype switching. With transposon mutagenesis, a mutant with a Tn5 inserted into the promoter region of the mab_3168c gene was found to switch its colonies from a rough to a smooth morphotype. This mutant had a higher sliding motility but a lower ability to form biofilms, aggregate in culture, and survive inside macrophages. Results of bioinformatic analyses suggest that the putative Mab_3168c protein is a member of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily. This prediction was supported by the demonstration that the mab_3168c gene conferred M. abscessus and M. smegmatis cells resistance to amikacin. The multiple roles of mab_3168c suggest that it could be a potential target for development of therapeutic regimens to treat diseases caused by M. abscessus. © 2013 Tsai et al.

84890481083	Development of fabrication technique in nano-scale resveratrol by collagen	Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene, RSV), is found in various plants, including grapes, berries and peanuts. It is also present in wines,especially red wines. RSV has potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and chemo-protective properties used as a biologically active supplement in the prophylaxis of myocardial infarction, diabetes, and tumours. The aim of this study was using nanotechnology to develop and examine a nanoparticle RSV.The techniques described the particles of nano RSV as having a size of 150-200 nm. In the evidence, we successfully developed a novel method of nano-RSV manufacture and demonstrated that this method could circumvent the physicochemical drawbacks of raw RSV with respect to dissolution, such as the reduction of particle size and gradually release from collagen materials.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data have shown the RSV nanoparticles in the collagen material, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) detected the adsorbed RSV nanoparticles at 950-1000 nm. In theory, collagen has similar properties to an emulsion/solvent that cause nanoformation of RSV under homogeneity of stirring. To study the biocompatibility, we also employed an in vitro model to estimate the potentialof the collagen materials contained with RSV nanoparticles to observe the cell growth. This paper presents an anticipation of nanotechnology for the nanoparticle RSV production that may provide high efficacy pharmacology in future. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

84893812383	ManA is regulated by RssAB signaling and promotes motility in Serratia marcescens	Serratia marcescens swarms on 0.8% LB agar at 30°C but not at 37°C. To understand the molecular mechanism regulating Serratia swarming, transposon mutagenesis was performed to screen for mutants that swarmed at 37°C. In one mutant, S. marcescens WW100, the transposon was inserted in the upstream region of manA, which encodes mannose-6-phosphate isomerase, a type I phosphomannose isomerase. The transcriptional and translational levels of manA were higher in S. marcescens WW100 than in the wild-type strain. S. marcescens WW100 produced more serrawettin W1 (biosurfactant) than the wild-type, as detected by thin-layer chromatography, to promote surface motility by reducing surface tension. Serratia swarming was previously shown to be negatively regulated by the RssA-RssB two-component system. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated that phosphorylated RssB (the response regulator) binds upstream of the transposon insertion site and manA in S. marcescens WW100. Analysis by real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that, compared to the wild-type level, manA mRNA was increased in the rssA deletion mutant. The results indicated that RssA-RssB signaling directly represses the expression of manA and that overexpression of manA increases the production of serrawettin for Serratia swarming at 37°C. © 2013 Institut Pasteur.

84894122544	Sero-diagnosis of mycobacterium avium complex lung disease using serum immunoglobulin a antibody against glycopeptidolipid antigen in Taiwan	Background: Lung disease (LD) due to non-tuberculous mycobacteria is an important clinical concern. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is one of the most common causative agents but the diagnosis of MAC-LD remains challenging. Detection of serum IgA antibody against MAC glycopeptidolipid (GPL) has recently been shown to improve the diagnosis of MAC-LD, but has yet to be validated worldwide. Methods: This prospective study was conducted in a tertiary referral center in northern Taiwan and enrolled patients with MAC-LD, MAC contamination, other lung diseases, and control subjects. Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody against MAC-GPL was detected in the participants and its specificity and sensitivity was assessed. Results: There were 56 patients with MAC-LD, 11 with MAC contamination, 13 M. kansasii-LD, 26 LD due to rapidlygrowing mycobacteria (RGM), 48 pulmonary tuberculosis, and 42 household contacts of patients with TB. Patients with MAC-LD were older and 32% of them had an underlying co-morbidity. By logistic regression, serum MAC-GPL IgA level was an independent predictor of MAC-LD among the study subjects and those with culture-positive specimens for MAC. By the receiver operating characteristic curve, serum MAC-GPL IgA had a good power to discriminate MAC-LD from MAC contamination. Under the optimal cut-off value of 0.73 U/mL, its sensitivity and specificity were 60% and 91%, respectively. Among MAC-LD patients, presence of co-morbidity was associated with MAC-GPL <0.73 U/ml in logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Measurement of serum anti-MAC-GPL IgA level is useful for the diagnosis of MAC-LD. However, its implement in clinical practice for immuno-compromised hosts needs careful consideration. © 2013 Shu et al.

84898893342	Application of an OLED integrated with BEF and giant birefringent optical (GBO) film in a SPR biosensor	This study aims to improve the signal sensitivity of a portable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor system. An organic light emitting diode (OLED) was integrated with a brightness enhancement film (BEF) and a giant birefringent optical (GBO) film as a light source to construct the SPR based on an OLED-BEF-GBO film. A method for calculating the SPR signal by summing the differences in optical intensity at two different wavelengths was used to minimize the effect of the noise error that particularly occurs in a portable SPR device. The experimental results indicated that the limit of detection (LOD) of the SPR using an Au sensing layer has an effective refractive index change of 7.8 × 10

84898954887	Ganoderma lucidum stimulates NK cell cytotoxicity by inducing NKG2D/NCR activation and secretion of perforin and granulysin	Ganoderma lucidum (G. lucidum) is a medicinal mushroom long used in Asia as a folk remedy to promote health and longevity. Recent studies indicate that G. lucidum activates NK cells, but the molecular mechanism underlying this effect has not been studied so far. To address this question, we prepared a water extract of G. lucidum and examined its effect on NK cells. We observed that G. lucidum treatment increases NK cell cytotoxicity by stimulating secretion of perforin and granulysin. The mechanism of activation involves an increased expression of NKG2D and natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), as well as increased phosphorylation of intracellular MAPKs. Our results indicate that G. lucidum induces NK cell cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines by activating NKG2D/NCR receptors and MAPK signaling pathways, which together culminate in exocytosis of perforin and granulysin. These observations provide a cellular and molecular mechanism to account for the reported anticancer effects of G. lucidum extracts in humans. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

84901947130	Cis-Resveratrol produces anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting canonical and non-canonical inflammasomes in macrophages	Resveratrol, a natural phenolic compound found in red grapes and wine, exists as cis and trans isomers. Recent studies have shown that trans-resveratrol possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-carcinogenic, anti-tumor and immunomodulatory properties. However, it remains unclear whether cis-resveratrol may exhibit similar activities. The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of cis- and trans-resveratrol on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators in human macrophages. We examined the possibility that cis- and trans-resveratrol may affect cytokine secretion by modulating inflammasomes, intracellular multi-protein complexes, the assembly of which leads to caspase-1 activation and secretion of active IL-1β by macrophages. Our results show that pre-treatment of macrophages with cis-resveratrol not only reduces pro-IL-1β production and IL-1β secretion, but also suppresses ATP-induced transcription and activation of caspase-1 and caspase-4. Notably, cis-resveratrol inhibits the expression of the purinergic receptor, P2X7R, and the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker, Glc-regulated protein 78, but also reduces reactive oxygen species production. Moreover, cis-resveratrol attenuates cyclooxygenase-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 production. cis-Resveratrol also decreases the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and expression of the c-Jun protein. These results indicate that cis-resveratrol produces anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting both the canonical and non-canonical inflammasomes, and associated pathways in human macrophages.

84905082572	The medicinal fungus Antrodia cinnamomea suppresses inflammation by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome	Ethnopharmacological relevance Antrodia cinnamomea - a medicinal fungus that is indigenous to Taiwan - has been used as a health tonic by aboriginal tribes and the Asian population. Recent studies indicate that Antrodia cinnamomea extracts exhibit hepato-protective, anti-hypertensive, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, immuno-modulatory, and anti-cancer effects on cultured cells and laboratory animals. This study aims to explore the anti-inflammatory activity of an Antrodia cinnamomea ethanol extract (ACEE) and elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed, ATP-stimulated human THP-1 macrophages. Materials and methods The effects of ACEE on cell viability were studied using the MTT assay. The expressions of genes, proteins, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting and ELISA, respectively. The ACEE was further investigated for its effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production using ROS detection kit. Results Our results showed that ACEE significantly inhibits ATP-induced secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-18 (IL-18) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) by LPS-primed macrophages. ACEE also suppresses the transcription and activation of caspase-1, which is responsible for the cleavage and activation of IL-1β and IL-18. Of note, ACEE not only reduces expression of the inflammasome component NLRP3 and the purinergic receptor P2X

84914115520	NK cells kill mycobacteria directly by releasing perforin and granulysin	Although the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of NK cells on tumor cells and intracellular bacteria have been studied extensively, it remains unclear how these cells kill extracellular bacterial pathogens. In this study, we examine how human NK cells kill Mycobacterium kansasii and M.tb. The underlying mechanism is contact dependent and requires two cytolytic proteins: perforin and granulysin. Mycobacteria induce enhanced expression of the cytolytic proteins via activation of the NKG2D/NCR cell-surface receptors and intracellular signaling pathways involving ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPKs. These results suggest that NK cells use similar cellular mechanisms to kill both bacterial pathogens and target host cells. This report reveals a novel role for NK cells, perforin, and granulysin in killing mycobacteria and highlights a potential alternative defense mechanism that the immune system can use against mycobacterial infection.

84919964490	Wnt5A regulates ABCB1 expression in multidrug-resistant cancer cells through activation of the non-canonical PKA/β-catenin pathway	Multidrug resistance in cancer cells arises from altered drug permeability of the cell. We previously reported activation of the Wnt pathway in ABCB1-overexpressed human uterus sarcoma drug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 cells through active β-catenin and associated transactivation activities, and upregulation of Wnt-targeting genes. In this study, Wnt5A was found to be significantly upregulated in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ ADR2 cells, suggesting an important role for the Wnt5A signaling pathway in cancer drug resistance. Higher cAMP response elements and Tcf/Lef transcription activities were shown in the drug-resistant cancer cells. However, expression of Wnt target genes and CRE activities were downregulated in Wnt5A shRNA stably-transfected MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Cell viability of the drug-resistant cancer cells was also reduced by doxorubicin treatment and Wnt5A shRNA transfection, or by Wnt5A depletion. The in vitro data were supported by immunohistochemical analysis of 24 paired breast cancer biopsies obtained pre- and post-chemotherapeutic treatment. Wnt5A, VEGF and/or ABCB1 were significantly overexpressed after treatment, consistent with clinical chemoresistance. Taken together, the Wnt5A signaling pathway was shown to contribute to regulating the drug-resistance protein ABCB1 and β-catenin-related genes in antagonizing the toxic effects of doxorubicin in the MDR cell lines and in clinical breast cancer samples.

11144286044	Surface plasmon resonance biochips for tuberculosis bacillus detection	Tuberculosis is one of notifiable infectious diseases which may cause serious epidemic problems. Traditional diagnostic techniques include acid- fast stain, bacteria culture, metabolic monitoring have some disadvantages such as low sensitivity, time consumption and less specificity. In this study we proposed a new diagnostic technique based on the protein chips concept which detected by SPR phenomena. It was found that the resonance angle (∼51.86°) shifted slightly toward right with antibody concentration of 10X, 30X, 100X, and 300X dilution under optimal concentration of immobilized TB antigen W38 (MW 41.5 kDa, 50 μg/ml). While for the W06 (MW 14 kDa, 50 μg/ml), the resonance angle was around 50.13° and shifted with the same trend as W38 did.
