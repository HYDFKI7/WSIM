8644254950	Expression modulation of multiple cytokines in vivo by cyanobacteria blooms extract from taihu lake, China	Cyanobacterial blooms that generate microcystins (MCs) are being increasingly recognized as a potent health hazard in aquatic ecosystems. However, immunomodulation induced by cyanotoxins has not been well documented. This paper reports the in vivo data on the immune disorder caused by crude microcystin (MC) extract of cyanobacteria blooms collected from Taihu Lake, China, with respect to cytokine mRNA levels. Using reverse-transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the expression of multiple cytokines, including proinflammatory (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6) and Th1/Th2-related cytokines (IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10), was evaluated following the cyanobacteria blooms extract containing MCs (CBE) exposure at four doses of 23, 38, 77, 115 mg lyophilized algae cells/kg body weight. The results showed that the mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2 and IL-4 decreased significantly following injection of all doses as compared to the control (LPS or ConA only), while the IL-6 level was unaffected. Contrast to this decrease, the level of IL-10 mRNA was, however, transiently up regulated following injection of the lowest dose of CBE. The distinct patterns of expression of these cytokines suggested a modulation of cytokine network, the essential component of the host immune system. We further developed a mathematical model to simulate the interaction of T helper cell subsets and related cytokines, which proved to be a good approach to study the kinetics of the interaction of cells and cytokines in microcystin immunosuppression. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

16244365570	Hypothesis on cyanobacteria bloom-forming mechanism in large shallow eutrophic lakes	Eutrophication in Chinese lakes is one of the most serious water-pollution problems present and will still be in the near future. It is very important to forecast the occurrence of cyanobacteria bloom in lakes and then find a way to reduce its impact on the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to get comprehensive knowledge about the cyanobacteria bloom-forming mechanism in eutrophic lakes. The aim of this paper is to explore the bloom-forming mechanism based on the past and present research works about the development of water bloom in aquatic ecosystems. We tried to expound the dominant physical, chemical and biological factors that might induce the formation of water bloom. We also discussed the reason why cyanobacteria, especial Microcystis, become the dominant species in phytoplankton community. Our discussion considered that the high nutrient level is just one of the factors that control the water bloom formation in Taihu Lake. We suggested that the future research should deal with not only the cyanobacteria bloom occurring period in summer but also the colony accumulating and settling process to the sediment surface in autumn and the recruiting process in spring. We also suggested the further investigation that should be interested for us: (1) What is the over-wintering survival strategy of Microcystis? (2) What is the colony composition really like? (3) How does the Microcystis turn from small size with only a couple of individual cells into large size with hundreds of cells, then conglutinated together by sheath to form water bloom? (4) How does the alga obtain the threshold valve that induce its recruitment in spring? (5) What is the biochemical and physiological characters that make cyanobacteria dominated in phytoplankton community? We considered that the outbreak of a bloom in short time is just an apparent phenomena. In fact, the bloom is the result of a variation of vertical position of large volume of algal biomass that is gradually developed and accumulated for long time. According to the ecological theory and the in situ observation of the water bloom in Taihu Lake, we raised the four-phase development hypothesis on the process of the cyanobacteria bloom-forming: dormancy in winter, recruitment in spring, growth and float to the water surface in summer and sink to the sediment in autumn. There are different factors that will influence the status of algae in different phases. For example, in the dormancy phases, it is likely to be controlled by low temperature and illumination; and during the recruitment; the main factors may be the temperature and dissolve oxygen on the sediment surface. In addition, the algal growth rate is controlled by the nutrient and energy needed for photosynthesis and cell division. We concluded that (1) the hydrological and meteorological condition would cause the algae to float up to the water surface and then form the water bloom; (2) the further pertinence survey is necessary to control the cyanobacteria bloom before it starts to recruit, develop and bloom.

23944487690	Recruitment of total phytoplankton, chlorophytes and cyanobacteria from lake sediments recorded by photosynthetic pigments in a large, shallow lake (Lake Taihu, China)	Recruitment of total phytoplankton, chlorophytes and cyanobacteria from lake sediments to the water column was studied using photosynthetic pigments at one site (1.5 m) in Lake Taihu, a large shallow lake in China. Samples were taken weekly from the migration traps installed on the bottom from March to May 2004. Abundance of total phytoplankton, chlorophytes and cyanobacteria were represented by Chlorophyll (Chl) a, b, and phycocyanin (PC), respectively. Over the three months, total phytoplankton, chlorophytes, and cyanobacteria corresponding to 48.9%, 68.9% and 316.2% of their initial concentrations in surface sediments were recruited in Lake Taihu. However, compared with their increase in pelagic abundance over the same period, the recruitment accounted for a rather small inoculum. Accompanying the recruitment, total phytoplankton and chlorophytes declined and cyanobacteria increased in the upper 0-2 cm sediments; colonies of Microcystis aeruginosa in the water column enlarged from small size with several cells to large colonies with hundreds of cells. Thus, overwintering and subsequent growth renewal of pelagic phytoplankton merits further study and comparison with benthic survival and recruitment. © 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

24344504454	Effects of zooplankton grazing on colony formation in algae: A review	In order to understand the mechanisms of bloom formation in cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), we reviewed the literature on inducing effects of grazing pressure of zooplankton on colony formation in algae. These published studies demonstrated that effect of colony-inducing compounds released by herbivorous zooplankton is a key factor in colony formation of algae. The inducing chemicals are not the functional constituents of the organisms involved but the result of the interaction between species. Probably two different mechanisms are involved in the colony formation. One mechanism such as in Scenedesmus spp., is that colonies are formed when daughter cells of a recently divided cell fail to separate during reproduction, the other is that colonies are formed through adhesion of already existing single cells, such as in Microcystis aeruginosa. Because a high proportion of colonies could significantly reduce the grazing rate of zooplankton, algal colony formation may be interpreted as an induced defense strategy against grazing to pare down mortality due to animal grazing. If colony formation in cyanobacteria is induced by the grazing pressure in eutrophic waters then visible blooms will occur when colonies accumulate to certain magnitudes under favorable hydrometeorological conditions. It is therefore important to conduct research on the early stage of colony formation in cyanobacteria induced by grazing pressure of herbivorous zooplankton to understand the bloom formation and to provide insights into the adaptive mechanisms of inducing defense against grazing in algae as one of the complex interactions among organisms in aquatic ecosystems.

25144442576	Effects of filtered lake water on colony formation and growth rate in Microcystis aeruginosa of different physiological phases	Lake water, which contained an abundance of zooplankton, was passed through a 0.15 μm membrane filter, and 20 ml were immediately added to 80 ml suspensions of Microcystis aeruginosa in either exponential or late stationary growth phase. In the control system, 20 ml of BG-11 medium were added. After two days, colony formation was observed in the treatment of the exponential growth phase M. aeruginosa, whereas no colonies were formed in the control. The mean number of cells per unit of M. aeruginosa increased significantly compared with that in the control (P<0.05). However, late stationary phase M. aeruginosa populations, both in the control and in the treatment, were strongly dominated by unicells and paired cells, and no colonies were formed. As a consequence, no significant difference in the mean number of cells per unit was detected between the control and the treatment (P>0.05). However, no significant difference in the growth rate was detected between the control and the treatment (P>0.05), regardless of growth phase. These results indicated that any chemicals released from zooplankton had no influence on the growth of M. aeruginosa, and the inducible colony formation in M. aeruginosa was related to physiological phase.

26244445194	Observation on colony formation of Microcystis aeruginosa induced by filtered lake water under laboratory conditions	Microcystis aeruginosa mainly occurs as single cells in laboratory cultures, but in the colonial morph under natural conditions. This phenomenon suggests that some factors may be responsible for the typical occurrence of colonies in lakes. To demonstrate this possible effect, lake water with abundant or few zooplankton was filtered through a 0.15 μm membrane filter, and used as test water. Microcystis aeruginosa was cultured in BG-11 medium, with or without test water. The results showed that filtered lake water with abundant zooplankton could induce colony formation in M. aeruginosa, whereas M. aeruginosa populations in the control and the treatment of filtered lake water with few zooplankton were still strongly dominated by unicells and paired cells, and no colony was formed. In the treatment of filtered lake water with abundant zooplankton, some colonies of several, dozens, and sometimes even hundreds of M. aeruginosa cells were formed. The unicells reduced to 53.4±6.5% and the proportion of cells in colonies increased from 0 to 24.5±4.6% of the populations. The mean number of cells per unit of M. aeruginosa in the treatment of filtered lake water with abundant zooplankton was promoted significantly compared with those of the control and the treatment of filtrated lake water with few zooplankton. In addition, no significant difference in growth rate was detected between the control and the treatments, regardless to the filtered lake water (i.e. with abundant zooplankton or with few zooplankton). Thus, we concluded that colony formation in our experiment was probably not associated with the nutrition difference but with some dissolved substances probably released from abundant zooplankton in the natural lake water, which may be one of the environmental factors responsible for the colonial form in M. aeruginosa.

33646375966	Recruitment dynamics of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in Meiliang Bay of Taihu Lake	A collection trap was installed on the sediments in Meiliang Bay of Taihu Lake during the period from March to June to investigate the recruitment of phytoplankton, and cyanobacteria in particular. The algal abundance in the trap was monitored, and compared with that in water column and surface sediments. The results showed that the algal recruitment was related to the temperature, irradiance, DO content, and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) in surface sediment. After over-wintering on the sediments, the colonies of cyanobacteria experienced a prior developmental process before re-invasion of the water column. During the investigation period, the recruitment rates of chlorophyll a and b and PC were 59.84%, 76.83% and 466.98%, and the recruitment amounts accounted for 7.18%, 3.71% and 9.33% of their maximum pelagic counterparts in water column, respectively. These results showed that shallow lake was the important seed bank to the pelagic populations, and water bloom was formed as the result of the recruitment and biomass accumulation of cyanobacteria.

33646697138	Morphological response of Microcystis aeruginosa to grazing by different sorts of zooplankton	In the experiment we investigated the effect of grazing by different sorts of zooplankton on the induction of defensive morphology in the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. The results showed that protozoan flagellate Ochromonas sp. grazing could induce colony formation in M. aeruginosa, whereas M. aeruginosa populations in the control and the grazing treatments of copepod Eudiaptomus graciloides, cladoceran Daphnia magna, and rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus were still strongly dominated by unicells and paired cells and no colony forma occurred. In the protozoan grazing treatment, the proportion of unicells reduced from 83.2% to 15.7%, while the proportion of cells in colonial form increased from 0% to 68.7% of the population at the end of the experiment. The occurrence of a majority of colonial M. aeruginosa being in the treatment with flagellates, indicated that flagellate grazing on solitary cells could induce colony formation in M. aeruginosa. The colonies could effectively deter flagellate from further grazing and thus increase the survival of M. aeruginosa. The colony formation in M. aeruginosa may be considered as an inducible defense against flagellate grazing under the conditions that toxin cannot deter flagellate from grazing effectively. © Springer 2006.

33745826307	Effects of wind and wind-induced waves on vertical phytoplankton distribution and surface blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa in Lake Taihu	Effects of wind and wind-induced waves on vertical phytoplankton distribution and Microcystis aeruginosa bloom formation were studied in Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu from September 5 to 9, 2004. Concentrations of chlorophyll a, b, and phycocyanin in the water column were used to represent the abundance of total phytoplankton, chlorophytes, and cyanobacteria, respectively. Water samples were taken under different wind and wind-induced wave conditions. Ca. 90% of Microcystis aeruginosa had densities less than that of lake water and were thereby positively buoyant. Vertical distributions of total phytoplankton, chlorophytes, and cyanobacteria were markedly affected by wind and waves, with coefficients of variation of pigment concentrations throughout the water column showing a negative correlation with increasing wind and waves. Surface proportions of M. aeruginosa versus total amounts in the water column also closely correlated with wind and waves, which demonstrated that wind and waves directly influenced surface M. aeruginosa blooms in Lake Taihu. A less significant correlation was found for total phytoplankton, but there was no correlation for chlorophytes in the water column.

33746590324	Effects of Brachionus calyciflorus culture media filtrate on Microcystis aeruginosa, Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella vulgaris colony formation and growth	To examine the possible information transfer by chemicals between Zooplankton and algae, this paper studied the effects of Brachionus calyciflorus culture media filtrate on the colony formation and growth of Microcystis aeruginosa, Scenedesmus obliquas and Chlorella vulgaris. The results showed that the test filtrate could significantly promote the colony formation and population growth of S. obliquas, while no significant effect was observed on M. aeruginosa and C. vulgaris. The induced colony formation of S. obliquas increased its resistance to grazing, and thus, reduced the risk of its being grazed, which could be viewed as a kind of inducing defense. The accelerated growth of C. vulgaris and the toxin production of M. aeruginosa could also be interpreted as a defense mechanism against grazing. It maybe concluded that M. aeruginosa, S. obliquas and C. vulgaris could adopt different ecological strategies to resist the potential grazing by rotifer B. calyciflorus, and thus, to keep their population on a certain scale.

33749376845	Effects of dredging on extracellular microbial enzymes in the sediment of Taihu Lake, China	Temporal changes in extracellular enzymes were studied by fluorometric assay of the pre- and post-dredging sediments of Taihu Lake. After dredging, most of the assayed enzymes were depressed significantly except for lipase and sulfatase. Sediment dredging had a profound impact on the hydrolytic activities, which was a reflection of the functional composition of the microbial community of the lake sediments. The activities of the assayed enzymes did not significantly correlate with abiotic factors such as pH, redox potential, or total phosphorus, but their activities were significantly correlated with total organic carbon and total nitrogen except for three carbohydrases.

33751397748	Water quality risk assessment for sediment dredging operations, wulihu in taihu lake	To assess impacts and risks of sediments dredging on water environmental quality of Wulihu Lake, the principal components analysis method and the Monte Carlo romantic sampling model were used. Five principal constituents of Wulihu Lake were generalized and defined by using sixteen water quality index data, and it was studied the characteristics of the variation of every principal component and the comprehensive component with sediment dredging. The result show that during sediment dredging the water quality of Wulihu Lake were more serious, and the values of the comprehensive component and the principal component Fl increased to the highest level, were 1.15 and 5.0, respectively. This indicated that sediment dredging had great impacts on the water environment of Wulihu Lake, including sediment re-suspension, water transparency decrease, release of the internal nutrients and heavy metal ions etc. The risk of heavy metal release from re-suspended sediments and its certainty level were assessed and forecasted with the equilibrium partitioning model and the Monte Carlo romantic sampling method. The results also suggested that during sediment dredging, most of heavy metal ions have a great risk of release from re-suspended sediments with the certainty level over 90%; especially for Ni

33845243923	Effect of copper on membrane integrality and esterase activity of Microcystis aeruginosa using flow cytometry	The acute effects of copper on the membrane integrality and esterase activity of Microcystis aeruginosa were investigated using flow cytometry (FCM) and FDA/PI staining. After 1 h copper exposure, there was no significant effect on the membrane integrality in all concentration treatments, while modest stimulation of esterase activity was detectable by FDA staining. After 24 h copper exposure, this stimulation disappeared. In contrast, FDA fluorescence decreased as the copper concentration increased. At same time, the membrane was destructed detected by PI staining. The results suggested that the changes in FDA fluorescence were also related to the amount of fluorescein that leaked out from the cells. So the decreased FDA fluorescence was due to both inhibition of intracellular esterases and consequence of changes in membrane permeability.

Autofluorescence (chlorophyll a and phycocyanin) was used to identify species and count algal signals. The effect of multispecies population on copper toxicity of Microcystis aeruginousa was detected (1) at the same initial cell density, (2) at the same surface area, and (3) in the presence and absence of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Scenedesmus obliquus.

33947202240	Intracellular phosphorus metabolism and growth of Microcystis aeruginosa in dark/light cycles under various redox potential difference conditions	Phosphorus metabolism and growth of M. aeruginosa were studied under three different conditions of diel fluctuation in redox potential. Redox potential in the culture increased in light and decreased in dark in all treatments except one, when cysteine was added in darkness. Total phosphorus content in M. aeruginosa decreased in darkness and increased in light during exponential growth but increased continuously in the stationary phase. Conversely, polyphosphate (PolyP) accumulated in darkness but was lost in the light. Low redox potential in darkness promoted PolyP accumulation. Polyglucose and soluble orthophosphate may provide energy and phosphorus, respectively, for PolyP synthesis. PolyP was important to M. aeruginosa survival during poor growth conditions. If the redox potential difference in the dark/light cycle was large, M. aeruginosa initially grew faster, but soon lost viability. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

34047111293	Variations of bacterioplankton community composition during Microcystis spp. blooms in a shallow eutrophic lake	Variations of bacterioplankton community composition were monitored during Microcystis spp. blooms in Lake Taihu using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of amplified DNA fragments from April through November in 2005. Two sampling sites were selected - one in Meiliang Bay and the other in the center of the western region of the lake. The average abundance of Microcystis spp. was higher in Meiliang Bay than in the lake center, while the bacterioplankton community diversity of Meiliang Bay was significantly lower than that of the lake center (P < 0.05). Comparison of DGGE profiles indicated that in Meiliang Bay bacterioplankton communities decreased in band richness and species diversity as Microcystis spp. abundance increased. In the lake center, DGGE band number and Shannon index reached their peaks when Microcystis spp. blooms declined. The Shannon diversity index for the bacterioplankton community was negatively correlated with the Microcystis spp. abundance (r = -0.53, P = 0.10). Changes in composition and biodiversity of the bacterioplankton community in the two regions of the lake were moderately correlated with Microcystis spp. bloom formations, which suggested a possible linkage between bacterioplankton community variations and phytoplankton blooms events.

34248232983	Biochemical, morphological, and genetic variations in Microcystis aeruginosa due to colony disaggregation	Microcystis aeruginosa commonly occurs as large colonial morph under natural conditions, but disaggregates and exists as single cells in laboratory cultures. To demonstrate the adaptive changes, differentiation of carbohydrates, pigments, and protein between colonial and disaggregated M. aeruginosa were examined. Their morphological and ultrastructural characteristics were subsequently observed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Results showed that chlorophyll a and phycocyanin in cells, soluble carbohydrate produced in the culture medium, and total carbohydrate in cells and sheath of colonial M. aeruginosa are significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared with those in disaggregated cells. No significant change was found in protein concentration per cell (p > 0.05) between them. Their morphological and ultrastructural characteristics were evidently different, and by morphological criteria they could be separated into two morphotypes. In addition, the genetic diversity of 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer of them were examined and compared with reference strains of M. aeruginosa. The alignment of two sequences revealed that genetic identity level was extremely high (96.94%) and no significant difference was found in the nucleotide diversity (0.014 ± 0.008). This suggested that similar genotypes could present distinct morphotypes in M. aeruginosa. The tree topologies and analysis of molecular variance of the two sequences and reference sequences from GenBank database indicated that the genotypes of M. aeruginosa strains were not always related to their localities and exhibit heterogeneity within a species. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

34250888720	Effects of interspecific interactions between Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlorella pyrenoidosa on their growth and physiology	Interactions between Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlorella pyrenoidosa were analyzed by flow cytometry and by phytoplankton pulse-amplitude-modulated fluorimetry (Phyto-PAM) in joint cultures as well as in cultures separated by dialysis membranes. Results showed that the growth of C. pyrenoidosa was greater than that of M. aeruginosa, and that the growth of M. aeruginosa but not the growth of C. pyrenoidosa was significantly inhibited by the interactions between M. aeruginosa and C. pyrenoidosa. Culture filtrates of these two algae showed no apparent effects on the growth of the competing species. For M. aeruginosa, decreases in esterase activity, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and maximum quantum yield were observed in joint cultures, indicating that the metabolic activity and photosynthetic capacity of M. aeruginosa were suppressed. Light limitation from the shading effect of C. pyrenoidosa may be the main reason for such inhibition. For C. pyrenoidosa, esterase activity was suppressed in membrane-separated and joint cultures, suggesting that C. pyrenoidosa was probably affected by allelopathic substances secreted by M. aeruginosa. However, no significant difference was observed in the chlorophyll a fluorescence and maximum quantum yield of C. pyrenoidosa in the two cultures. In addition, interspecific interactions induced a reduction in size in both M. aeruginosa and C. pyrenoidosa, which may contribute to the development of C. pyrenoidosa dominance in the present study. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

34547600861	Survival of Microcystis aeruginosa and Scenedesmus obliquus under dark anaerobic conditions	The cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa and the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus were incubated individually and together in the dark and under anaerobic conditions created by adding the reducing agent cysteine. Flow cytometry was used to monitor cell concentrations, fluorescence of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), and cell metabolic activity measured with an esterase-sensitive probe to detect fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis of the two species. M. aeruginosa showed a slight increase in cell metabolic activity, no conspicuous death of cells, and absence of decay of chlorophyll-a fluorescence in individual and competition cases under dark anaerobic conditions. Cell metabolic activity and fluorescence of S. obliquus, on the contrary, decreased sharply, and cell concentrations fluctuated markedly with time in the unialgal cultures, but showed only a slight decline in the mixed cultures. M. aeruginosa appeared to be more tolerant to dark anaerobic conditions than S. obliquus, which may arise in eutrophic lakes beneath thick surface scums in the water column, or in the bottom sediments. Tolerance of these conditions may be important to the dominance of M. aeruginosa in eutrophic lakes. © CSIRO 2007.

Infochemicals released from D. carinata induced colony formation in S. obliquus. The contents of soluble extracellular polysaccharides, bounded extracellular polysaccharides, and the total polysaccharides per cell in the induced colonies of S. obliquus increased significantly relative to those of the unicells, which indicated that Daphnia-associated infochemicals could also stimulate S. obliquus to increase the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides. The increased extracellular polysaccharides may play an important role in cementing S. obliquus cells together to form colonies.

Two methods, microscopic evaluation and PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), were adopted to analyze the samples, The former did not find any significant seasonal variation of the dominant species (Microcystis aeruginosa, Microcystis wesenbergii and Microcystis flos-aquae) of the Microcystis community (P > 0.05). However, the latter discovered that the Microcystis communities in the samples collected in summer and winter were separated into two feature groups, but those in the samples collected in spring and autumn were intermingled. Moreover, analysis show genetic distance of Microcystis in the same season was smaller than those in different seasons (P < 0.01).

Results showed that M. aeruginosa and C. pyrenoidosa could utilize those three forms of organic phosphorus, but their growth rates and cell abundances were low in comparison with those in the orthophosphate control. M. aeruginosa had a higher growth rate than C. pyrenoidosa in glucose-1-phosphate, and then became dominate in the separate cultures. In contrast, those two algal species didn't show any significant differences in the growth rate and cell abundance in the medium with adenosine triphosphate and cyclicadenosine monophosphate. Alkaline phosphatase was an important enzyme for hydrolyzing glucose-1-phosphate, adenosine triphosphate and cyclic-adenosine monophosphate, the activity of which was positively correlated with the growth rate of algae. Considering the big proportion of glucose-1-phosphate in the Lake Taihu, the capability of M. aeruginosa to efficiently utilize this type of organic phosphorus source might be one of reason that why M. aeruginosa is the dominant species in this hyper-eutrophic lake.

The total number of T-RFs derived from all those water samples was 87, indicating high genetic diversity of cyano bacteria in Taihu Lake. Based on the relative abundances of T-RFs and cluster analysis, the similarities of different vertical samples were higher than 50%. By comparison, it was found that Microcystis spp. dominated in all sampling sites (relative abundance ranged from 17. 7% to 47. 5%). The number of T-RFs and cyanobacterial diversity was highest at Zhushan Bay but lowest in the western part of Taihu Lake. However, differences were not apparent among other sites (P > 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation (R = -0.958) between relative abundance of Microcystis and Shannon-Weiner index. The result of ANOSIM (Analysis of similarity) indicated that the seasonal variation of cyanobacterial community and diversity were extremely significant (P < 0.01). As to the Shannon-Weiner diversity index, samples derived from recruitment period reached the highest value, while samples at pre-over wintering stage in autumn showed the lowest. Cluster analysis revealed that the samples could be divided into two representative groups: Group I consists of samples collected in autumn, while group II contains the samples collected in spring and winter which were intermingled.

80052251438	Analyses on water quality and trophic status of urban lakes in Nanjing city	Urban lakes locate in city area or non-agricultural towns, which are very important to city ecosystem and habitation environment. In this paper, nine lakes of Nanjing city (Huashen Lake, Baijia Lake, Yueya Lake, Mochou Lake, Nanhu Lake, Pipa Lake, Qianhu Lake, Zixia Lake, and Xuanwu Lake) were selected and water samples were collected seasonally, so as to analyze water quality and trophic status. Results showed that two lakes were mesotrophic, three lakes were light eutrophic, three lakes were medium eutrophic, and even one lake was heavy eutrophic. Finally, special needs to be pointed out as follows: strict control of phosphorus concentration in Zixia Lake should be strengthened to avoid blooms occurrence; obvious swamping trends were observed in Pipa Lake, where clearing and dredging were needed; eutrophic conditions were quite serious in Mochou Lake, Nanhu Lake, and Yueya Lake, comprehensive restoration was required in these three lakes timely. © 2011 IEEE.

42149122643	Intra-habitat heterogeneity of environmental factors regulating bacterioplankton community composition in Lake Taihu, China	To investigate the intra-habitat heterogeneity of environmental factors that may have an impact on the bacterioplankton community composition (BCC), a 1 yr observation was done at 2 study sites in Lake Taihu, a large shallow eutrophic lake in China. One site was located at the center of Meiliang Bay, the other site was near the central region of the lake. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified partial 16S rRNA gene fragments was applied to analyze BCC. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) was used to investigate differences among BCC. Redundancy analyses (RDA) of the gel patterns, in relation to the physical, chemical, and biological factors of the 2 sites, were performed. Differences between the samples in Meiliang Bay and the lake center were evident during all periods. Four variables (the biomass of Microcystis spp., chl a, dissolved inorganic phosphorus [DIP], and water turbidity) were most strongly correlated with the bacterioplankton DGGE patterns. Particularly, significant intra-habitat heterogeneity of the environmental factors was detected. In Meiliang Bay, seasonal variations in DIP concentration had a profound impact on the composition of bacterioplankton communities, while in the lake center, wind-induced frequent sediment resuspension was an important reason for the variations in BCC. The inherent intra-habitat heterogeneity of environmental conditions is essential to maintain the heterogeneity of BCC at the 2 study sites. © Inter-Research 2007.

There were 23, 24 DGGE bands in East Taihu and Gonghu Bay, respectively (Shannon index were 3.135 and 3.178) and 18 bands in both Meiliang Bay and Wuli Bay (Both shannon index were 2.890). The result of cloning/sequencing indicated that there was a high diversity of small planktons in Lake Taihu and most of them phototrophic flagellate, heterotrophic flagellate, ciliate and fungi. There were various community structures in the three different clone libraries. In Meilang Bay, 28.6% OTUs (operational taxonomic unit) belonged to heterotrophic flagellate, followed by Cryptophyta (22.9%) and Chrysophyta (14.3%). In Central Lake, 25.7% OTUs belonged to Chrysophyta, followed by heterotrophic flagellate (20.0%) and Cryptophyta (14.3%). In East Taihu, ciliates were the dominant group and only a few heterotrophic flagellates (40.9%) were detected. In addition, fungi were relatively abundant (12.2%) in this area.

44249114387	Comparison of overwintering and recruitment of cyanobacteria in Taihu lake and Chaohu lake	Dynamics of overwintering and recruitment of cyanobacteria were studied in Taihu Lake and Chaohu Lake. The results demonstrated that cyanobacteria sank to the sediment in autumn (November) and recruited to water column in May in Taihu Lake. From November to next May, the cyanobacteria kept growing with an increased growth rate from March to May in the sediment. A similar pattern of overwintering and recruitment of cyanobacteria was found in Chaohu Lake, which showed the cyanobacteria sinking in November and recruitment in spring with the cyanobacteria growing in the sediment, while the cyanobacteria recruited to water column from March to April. Our results showed there was typical overwintering and recruitment of cyanobacteria in Taihu Lake and Chaohu Lake. The numbers of cyanobacteria in sediment represented by the almost same pigments content in different lake areas of Taihu Lake according to nutrient levels probably implied the little relationships of the numbers in sediments with the summer bloomed biomass of cyanobacteria.

44349166242	Changes in the morphology and polysaccharide content of Microcystis aeruginosa (Cyanobacteria) during flagellate grazing	To investigate the changes in the morphology and polysaccharide content of Microcystis aeruginosa (Kütz.) Kütz. during flagellate grazing, cultures of M. aeruginosa were exposed to grazing Ochromonas sp. for a period of 9 d under controlled laboratory conditions. M. aeruginosa responded actively to flagellate grazing and formed colonies, most of which were made up of several or dozens of cells, suggesting that flagellate grazing may be one of the biotic factors responsible for colony formation in M. aeruginosa. When colonies were formed, the cell surface ultrastructure changed, and the polysaccharide layer on the surface of the cell wall became thicker. This change indicated that synthesis and secretion of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) of M. aeruginosa cells increased under flagellate grazing pressure. The contents of soluble extracellular polysaccharide (sEPS), bound extracellular polysaccharide (bEPS), and total polysaccharide (TPS) in colonial cells of M. aeruginosa increased significantly compared with those in single cells. This finding suggested that the increased amount of EPS on the cell surface may play a role in keeping M. aeruginosa cells together to form colonies. © 2008 Phycological Society of America.

47649084235	Effects of tetrabromobisphenol A on the green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa	Flow cytometry (FC) was used to determine effects of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) on the green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa (C. pyrenoidosa) by evaluating esterase activity, membrane integrity, concentrations of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) auto-fluorescence. TBBPA can inhibit esterase activity. Esterase activity was inversely proportional with TBBPA with a 24 h EC50 value of 3.13 mg TBBPA/L. After 48 h of exposure to TBBPA intracellular ROS was significantly greater than in the unexposed cells. TBBPA inhibited Chl-a fluorescence after 168 h. Concentrations of ROS were directly proportional to both magnitude and duration of exposure and was inversely proportional to cellular Chl-a. FC was useful as an integrated, ecologically relevant, measure of a functional response of the algae. The possible action pathway of TBBPA in C. pyrenoidosa is that TBBPA can cause toxic effects on esterase activity. As concentrations and exposure time increased, TBBPA change the ROS level in the internal. The role of anti-oxidative action is marked and significant at the duration of 48 h exposure, compared to the control. This suggested there was a redox cycle. TBBPA changes physiological status of cells, further decreased Chl-a fluorescence indicating inhibition. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

51349096469	Genetic diversity of eukaryotic microorganisms in Lake Taihu, a large shallow subtropical lake in China	We investigated the genetic diversity of eukaryotic microorganisms (0.8-20 μm) by sequencing cloned 18S rRNA genes in six genetic libraries constructed from six locations in Lake Taihu, a large shallow subtropical lake in China. Genetic libraries of eukaryotic ribosomal RNA were screened by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, and one clone representative of each RFLP pattern was partially sequenced. A total of 528 clones were clustered into 165 RFLP patterns and finally into 131 operational taxonomic unit (OTUs). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that each library included many unique OTUs, as well as members of distantly related phylogenetic groups. A majority of the clones were from alveolates, stramenopiles, cercozoa, cryptophytes, chlorophytes, and fungi, with members of choanoflagellida, euglenida, centroheliozoa, ancyromonadidae, ichthyosporea, and kathablepharid representing a minor fraction of the library. Six OTUs (15 clones) were not related to any known eukaryotic group. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that the differences in eukaryotic microorganism community composition of in the six regions were partially related to trophic status, sediment resuspension, and top-down regulation by metazooplankton. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

51349165443	Relationship between temperature and cyanobacterial recruitment from sediments in laboratory and field studies	Cyanobacterial recruitment from sediments and its driving factors were studied in both a laboratory simulation and a field study in Lake Taihu (China) during March through June 2004. Microcystis aeruginosa constituted 95% of the cyanobacteria in the laboratory and field samples. In the laboratory, senescent cyanobacteria renewed growth between 5°C and 9°C and started recruitment to the water column at 14°C, while in Lake Taihu they simultaneously grew and left the sediment surface at 9°C. We found a close correlation between algal recruitment and cumulative temperatures, in terms of the sum of effective temperatures, both in the laboratory simulation and the field study. Because recruitment is the result of algal growth, we assume cumulative temperature only indirectly drove cyanobacterial recruitment but directly promoted cyanobacterial growth to reduce ballast.

In this study, serum testosterone concentration, activity of liver microsome ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione S-tranferases (GST) of crucian carp (Carassius carassius) exposed to PCP for 7 and 15 d, respectively, were examined. The results showed that testosterone concentration was induced remarkably after 7 d (P<0.05), and the testosterone concentrations in 15 d treatment crucian carp were higher than those in 7 d treatment. It was found that there were significant effects on activities of EROD and GST after crucian carp were exposed to PCP for 7 and 15 d (P<0.05), compared to the controls. EROD and GST activities increased with increase in PCP concentration and also with increase in time on exposure. The results indicated that serum testosterone, EROD and GST were sensitive endpoints to PCP. PCP may have endocrine disrupting activities and may affect the reproductive success of this species. It is possible that the changes of hepatic microsome enzyme activities may result in alterations of serum testosterone levels in crucian carp. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AOB in the samples were enumerated by most-probable-number (MPN) method. Nested polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) procedures were performed with ammonia oxidizer-selective primers.

The cell density of C. pyrenoidosa in the rotifer water treatment was significantly higher than that in the control, suggesting that substance(s) from the rotifer stimulated the alga to grow faster. Additionally, the cell size of C. pyrenoidosa in the rotifer water treatment was consistently smaller than that in the control.

55549145478	Interspecific interaction between Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlorella pyrenoidosa in different phosphate media	The effects of pyrophosphate and polyphosphate on the growth of Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlorella pyrenoidosa were studied in unialgal cultures and in cultures separated by a dialysis membrane. M. aeruginosa and C. pyrenoidosa were able to similarly utilize pyrophosphate and polyphosphate, but their growth rates and cell densities were low in comparison with those in the orthophosphate controls. C. pyrenoidosa had a higher growth rate than M. aeruginosa in both unialgal and the separated cultures; moreover, C. pyrenoidosa had a greater ability to utilize phosphorus than M. qeruginosa. But because the C. pyrenoidosa population developed early but then declined, M. aeruginosa eventually became dominant in the separated cultures. Therefore, the interaction between M. aeruginosa and C. aeruginosa might be complex because of an allelopathy effect, and nutrient competition is not the only factor determining species dominance in the phytoplankton assemblage.

58649090240	Recruitment of bloom-forming cyanobacteria and its driving factors	Based on most of the literature, this paper reviewed the progress made in following aspects: cognition to cyanobacteria recruitment, various traps for studying cyanobacteria recruitment in lakes, recruitment patterns of some species of cyanobacteria, and the driving factors for recruitment. Additionally, perspective studies of cyanobacteria recruitment in lakes were pointed out. In light of the existing knowledge, cyanobacteria recruitment could be regarded as a process that benthic overwintering cyanobacteria migrated to the pelagic phase after germination and growth renewal under suitable conditions. This process was divided into three consecutive phases: germination, a potential growth phase, and migration to the pelagic phase. Previous studies mostly focused on the migration from sediments to water. To date, several kinds of traps had been designed to investigate cyanobacteria recruitment. Some studies showed that amounts of cyanobacteria recruitment were higher in shallow regions than deep regions of lakes, and the recruitment rates mostly peaked in a given time of year before blooms onset. Temperature, resuspension and bioturbation had been recognized to be the most important factors for driving cyanobacteria recruitment. Other factors (such as light, nutrients, anoxia, etc.) also played a role. © 2008 Academic Journals.

60949104188	Application of SVM on Chl-a concentration retrievals in Taihu Lake	Considering limited monitoring points in lakes, support vector machines (SVM) was chosen to retrieve chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration with MODIS data. In this research, 29 monitoring points of Taihu Lake in August, 2005 were divided into training and testing group and validating group. 4 SVM models, a linear regression model, a principle component analysis (PCA) model and an artificial neural net (ANN) model were constructed using trailing and testing group. Validation data was used to compare with other 3 models and SVM model. The retrieving precision of ANN model and SVM model were both better than the other two models, especially the average relative error of SVM model was only 15.91% and 10% lower than ANN model. Chl-a distribution of Taihu Lake on Aug 15, 2005 was retrieved synchronously using SVM model and ANN model. At last, the main factors affecting the distribution of chl-a were discussed.

66949165911	Molecular identification of the colony-associated cultivable bacteria of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa and their effects on algal growth	Fourteen bacteria were isolated from a natural bloom of Microcystis aeruginosa colonies collected from Lake Taihu. According to 16S rDNA sequence analysis, seven isolates were related to Alphaproteobacteria including the genera Erythromicrobium, Porphyrobacter, Sphingomonas, Sandarakinorhabdus, Afipia, and two unclassified genera. Six isolates were affiliated with the genera Aquimonas, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Stenotrophomonas of the Gammaproteobacteria group. One isolate was related to Sphingomonadales (Betaproteobacteria). In subsequent assays, the bacterial isolates variously affected the growth of M. aeruginosa (i.e., positively or negatively). All bacterial isolates were able to grow in a medium in which the only carbon source was filtrate of the M. aeruginosa culture, indicating that these bacteria may be associated with M. aeruginosa not only as a substrate for colonization but also as energy source.

67549105047	Effect of filtered cultures of flagellate Ochromonas sp. on colony formation in Microcystis aeruginosa	The possible effect of filtered cultures of flagellate Ochromonas sp. on colony formation in M. aeruginosa was investigated in this paper. The results show that filtered cultures of flagellates fed with M. aeruginosa could induce colony formation in M. aeruginosa. Furthermore, induction strength is clearly dependent on the concentration of flagellates and filtered cultures. However, no colonial M. aeruginosa was found in the treatments of filtered cultures of flagellates fed with Microcystis wesenbergii, filtered cultures of flagellate fed with Chlorella pyrenoidosa, and algae homogenates. This suggests that infochemicals released from flagellates fed with M. aeruginosa may be a trigger for colony formation in M. aeruginosa. The clearance rates of flagellates on algae were markedly decreased when they were cultivated with induced colonial M.aeruginosa. These indicate that colony formation in M. aeruginosa is a predator-induced defense which could reduce predation risk from flagellates. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The theoretical analysis has been done from basic theory and learning target of these two methods first. Then two empirical algorithms have been developed to relate reflectance of MODIS to in situ concentrations of chlorophyll a. The performance of ANN and SVM is comparatively analyzed in terms of validation, stability and robustness assessment and chlorophyll a distribution of Taihu Lake from two algorithms. The root of mean square deviation (RMSE) and average relative error (ARE) of validation data is only 5.85 and 26.5% of SVM retrieval model, however, RMSE and ARE of ANN model is 13.04 and 46.8%. Stability and robustness assessment suggest that SVM provides the better performance than ANN. And the retrieval results show that the chlorophyll a distribution of the whole lake from two algorithms is similar, however, the chlorophyll a concentration in the eastern region and central region of Taihu Lake is distorted by ANN model because of the limitations, such as learning target setting and over-learning in net construction.

66249091589	Two-decade reconstruction of algal blooms in China's Lake Taihu	The algal blooming in the inland lakes has become a critically important issue for its impacts not only on local natural and social environments, but also on global human community. However, the occurrences of blooming on larger spatial scale and longer time scale have rarely been studied. As the third largest freshwater lake in China, Lake Taihu has drawn increasing attention from both public and scientific communities concerning its degradation. Using available satellite images, we reconstructed the spatial and temporal patterns of algal blooms in Lake Taihu through the past two decades. The blooming characteristics over the past two decades were examined with the dynamic of initial blooming date being highlighted. The initial blooming dates were gradually becoming later and later from 1987 to 1997. Since 1998, however, the initial blooming date came earlier and earlier year by year, with approximately 11.42 days advancement per year. From 1987 to 2007, the annual duration of algal blooms lengthened year by year, in line with the substantial increases in the occurrences of algal blooms in spring and summer months. The algal blooms usually occur in northern bays and spread to center and south parts of Lake Taihu. The increases in previous winter's mean daily minimum temperature partially contributed to the earlier blooming onset. However, human activities, expressed as total gross domestic product (GDP) and population, outweighed the climatic contribution on the initial blooming date and blooming duration. This study may provide insights for the policy makers who try to curb the algal blooming and improve the water quality of inland freshwater lakes. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

67649780570	Effects of enhanced temperature on algae recruitment and phytoplankton community succession	Effects of enhanced temperature on phytoplankton recruitment and phytoplankton community succession were analyzed by a simulation experiment. Winter sediment was collected from Taihu Lake and cultured in BG-11 medium. The incubation temperatures were enhanced from 5.5°C to 30°C with eight gradients, and each temperature level was kept for ten days. Microscopic morphological observation was applied to analyze algal specific growth rate (SGR) and phytoplankton community succession, meanwhile fluorescence analysis was performed to detect variations of photosynthetic pigment concentration. Recruitment of Chlorophytes and Diatoms was observed at 9°C, but that of Cyanobacteria was not evidently detected until 12.5°C. Recruitment of Cyanobacteria initiated later than Chlorophytes and Diatoms, but the specific growth rate of Cyanobacteria after recruitment was highest. Phytoplankton community was overwhelmingly composed of Cyanobacteria, Chlorophytes, and Diatoms when temperature exceeded 12.5°C. Moreover, Chlorophytes dominated phytoplankton community at 12.5°C and 16°C, Cyanobacteria subsequently established dominance above 19.5°C. Concentration of chlorophyll a increased evidently at 9°C and 16°C, while that of phycocyanin went up markedly only at 16°C. Pigment concentration increased with the recruitment of Chlorophytes and Diatoms synchronously, but lagged behind Cyanobacteria recruitment.

67651095675	Effects of light and wind speed on the vertical distribution of microcystis aeruginosa colonies of different sizes during a summer bloom	Different dynamics, of the vertical distribution of Microcystis aeruginosa colonies of different sizes, were examined in a large shallow lake (Taihu Lake) during a summer bloom. During the observation the Microcystis colonies, larger than 120 μm, were mainly concentrated in the upper layer both under calm and windy conditions. Colonies from 36 μm to 120 μm showed a clear relationship to wind conditions whereas colonies less than 36 μm showed a nearly uniform vertical distribution at the different depths. There was no clear relationship between the vertical distribution of colonies larger than 36 μm and light intensity. However, at solar noon, colonies less than 36 μm were mainly distributed in the middle layers of the water column. The results indicate that small colonies are easily affected by the wind-induced mixing, and they show an ability for active movement in response to light intensity under calm conditions. In contrast, large colonies tend to show little diurnal repositioning to light intensity and thereby are mainly concentrated in the surface layer.

70349559731	Benefits and costs of the grazer-induced colony formation in Microcystis aeruginosa	Colonial Microcystis aeruginosa were obtained when the unicellular algae were exposed to flagellate Ochromonas sp. filtrate. To investigate the benefit of this morphological change, flagellates were added into cultures of unicellular and colonial M. aeruginosa, respectively. The clearance rates of flagellates on algae were markedly decreased when they were cultivated with induced colonial M. aeruginosa. This result indicated that colony formation in M. aeruginosa was a predator-induced defense, which could reduce predation risk from flagellate. The increased content of soluble extracellular polysaccharide (sEPS) and bound extracellular polysaccharide (bEPS) may play an important role in adhering M. aeruginosa cells together to form colonies. The decrease of ΦPPS II and the increase of sinking rates of induced colonial M. aeruginosa showed that the costs of grazed-induced colony formation in M. aeruginosa may reflect in the photosystem II efficiency, and in the sinking rates. © EDP Sciences, 2009.

70449115199	Phylogenetic diversity and specificity of bacteria associated with Microcystis aeruginosa and other cyanobacteria	Interactions between bacteria and cyanobacteria have been suggested to have a potential to influence harmful algal bloom dynamics; however, little information on these interactions has been reported. In this study, the bacterial communities associated with five strains of Microcystis aeruginosa, three species of other Microcystis spp., and four representative species of non-Microcystis cyanobacteria were compared. Bacterial 16S rDNA fragments were amplified and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) followed by DNA sequence analysis. The similarities among bacterial communities associated with these cyanobacteria were compared to the digitized DGGE profiles using the cluster analyses. The bacterial community structure of all cyanobacterial cultures differed. Cluster analysis showed that the similarity values among M. aeruginosa cultures were higher than those of other cyanobacterial cultures. Sequence analysis of DGGE fragments indicated the presence of bacteria including, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria in the cyanobacterial cultures. Members of the Sphingomonadales were the prevalent group among the Microcystis-associated bacteria. The results provided further evidence for species-specific associations between cyanoabcteria and heterotrophic bacteria, which are useful for understanding interactions between Microcystis and their associated bacteria. © 2009 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Results showed that cyanobacteria abundance in water column decreased from autumn to winter but increased in the sediment; in spring, cyanobacteria abundance decreased in sediment but increased in water column. Since phycocyanin in the sediment fluctuated during the year with maxima in March and minima in September, vertical migration and recruitment of cyanobacteria were apparent. Algal abundance and composition changed in the water column. Chlorophytes dominated phytoplankton community initially and were replaced by cyanobacteria especially Microcystis spp., which underwent a colony-enlargement process and evolved from colonies with a few cells to those with dozens or hundreds of cells before blooming in late June. © 2009 Academic Journals.

During the observations, the horizontal distributions of Microcystis, represented by Chlorophyll a, showed a clear concentration toward downwind lake areas. According to the lake currents and the Chl a concentrations on the boundary line between the Meiliang Bay and the open water, the transported Chl a was less than 2% of the total weight of Chl a in Meiliang Bay on August 22, 24 and 25. The results suggest that the horizontal distribution of the bloom-forming Microcystis was strongly affected by the wind conditions, and the wind-driven Microcystis accumulation was mainly determined by surface drift; the transport of Microcystis by lake currents was much less important in this large, shallow lake. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

77049088735	Seasonal variation of microbial eukaryotic community composition in the large, shallow, subtropical Taihu Lake, China	Microbial eukaryotic community (0. 8-20 μm) composition and its seasonal variation were investigated in large, shallow, subtropical Lake Taihu located in Southeast China. The water samples were collected monthly from August 2006 to July 2007 at two sites distantly located in Meiliang Bay and Lake Center, which differed strongly in their trophic status and sediment resuspension. The microbial eukaryotic community compositions (MECC) were measured using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene fragments. Seasonal variations were related to environmental factors by means of redundancy analysis (RDA) in order to reveal the most important regulating factors. At both sites, the structures and Shannon-Wiener indices of the microbial eukaryotic communities displayed apparent seasonal variations, which were significantly related to environmental variables. There were significant intrahabitat differences in environmental factors regulating MECC, as well as in the seasonal dynamics of the two sites during the study period. At Meiliang Bay, the variations of total phosphorus concentration and cladocera abundance had the most profound impacts on the microbial eukaryotic community composition, while at Lake Center, the total nitrogen concentration and conductivity were most influential. Our results suggest that the DGGE method is a cost-effective way to analyze the seasonal dynamics of MECC and their interaction with environmental variables, which will provide new insights into the diversity and dynamics of MECC. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

77952421434	Influence of intraspecific interaction and substrate type on initial growth and establishment of Hydrilla verticillata	Both substrate type and plant-plant interaction can greatly influence the growth and establishment of plants. In order to assist the re-vegetation of submerged macrophytes, the growth of Hydrilla verticillata with increasing equi-distance neighboring plant density on two substrate types (sediment and sand, representing high- and low-nutrient level, respectively) was assessed in monoculture stands. The results showed that substrate type greatly changed the biomass allocation patterns of the target plants, with a smaller root mass ratio on sediment compared to sand (0.70 vs. 3.11%). However, interaction between substrate type and neighboring density was observed. At low density, growth on sediment greatly increased plant height (43.90 vs. 22.10 cm), leaf biomass (216.63 vs. 68.41 mg), and total biomass (298.39 vs. 121.77 mg) when compared to growth on sand. However, at high density, no significant effect of the substrate type was found in those parameters. On sediment, high neighboring density greatly decreased the height, root number, total root length, root mass, and total biomass, implying large intraspecific plant-plant competition. However, such competition can be greatly reduced in infertile environments. Therefore, when the plants were grown on sand, neighboring density showed little effect on the height (22.10-26.53 cm), total root length (21.34-40.50 cm), and root biomass (3.14-6.27 mg). Total biomass and root number significantly increased by 50% and 115%, respectively, at high density compared to low density on sand, suggesting that facilitation rather than competition was occurring. Therefore, plant-plant interaction can vary from competition in fertile environments to facilitation in infertile environments. In summary, neighboring density should be manipulated according to the environmental nutrient level, so as to reduce intraspecific competition or increase intraspecific facilitation, and finally enhance the initial growth and establishment of H. verticillata in re-vegetation activities. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

77952970375	Community structure of bacteria associated with Microcystis colonies from cyanobacterial blooms	Thirty Microcystis colonies, belonging to three species (Microcystis aeruginosa, Microcystis flos-aquae, and Microcystis wesenbergii) were isolated from Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu in China. Bacterial communities associated with the single Microcystis colonies were investigated using a seminested polymerase chain reaction-amplification along with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The bacterial communities of most colonies of the same Microcystis species in each lake tended to be similar. This indicates that species-specific associations may exist between colony-associated bacteria and Microcystis spp. Sequence analysis of dominant DGGE bands revealed that the dominant bacterial groups associated with Microcystis colonies were Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Deinococcus-Thermus, and Gemmatimonadetes. Phylotypes related to Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp., and Flexibacteraceae were dominant in colonies of M. wesenbergii, M. flos-aquae, and M. aeruginosa, respectively.

Aphanothece halophytica Frémy is a bloom-forming cyanobacterium in salterns and can release large amounts of polysaccharide (AH-RPS). In the present study, we investigated the effect of AH-RPS on mutual flocculation of cyanobacterium and clay and further explored the mechanisms by which AH-RPS affected mutual flocculation. We determined that AH-RPS possessed clay-dispersing activity as defined as the ability to inhibit the flocculation and sedimentation of clay suspensions in water. Supplementation of AH-RPS in cyanobacterial cell suspensions and in the culture media containing the same kaolin clay concentration dose dependently decreased flocculation of cyanobacterial cells and increased clay-dispersing activity. These findings indicate that the clay-dispersing activity of AH-RPS was related to its inhibitory effect on mutual flocculation of cyanobacterial cells and clay particles. Moreover, the clay-dispersing activity of AH-RPS was stable from pH 3 to pH 10 and was increased by adding NaCl, MgCl

78649744175	Diversity and abundance of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria in two cyanobacterial bloom-forming lakes in China	Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria are widely distributed in marine and freshwater ecosystems. The aims of this study were to investigate the diversity and abundance of AAP bacteria in cyanobacterial bloom-forming eutrophic lakes and to study the association of AAP bacteria with the bloomforming cyanobacteria. Analysis of puf M gene (the light-reaction center gene) clone libraries indicated that in eutrophic lakes (Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu, China) with cyanobacterium Microcystis blooms, the AAP bacteria were related to members of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. In Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu, Alphaproteobacteria accounted for 81.5% and 75.0% of Microcystisassociated AAP bacteria, respectively, and 84.6% and 72.5% of free-living AAP bacteria, respectively. The predominance of Alphaproteobacteria in the two lakes was different from the previously reported predominance of Betaproteobacteria in freshwater lakes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that in Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu, AAP bacteria represented an important part of the bacterial community associated with Microcystis, and the abundance of Microcystis-associated AAP bacteria (18.3% and 11.7%, respectively) was higher than that of free-living AAP bacteria (5.1% and 7.9%, respectively). The abundance of AAP bacteria in the two bloom-forming lakes was higher than the previously reported level in other eutrophic freshwater bodies. © EDP Sciences, 2010.

78649582839	Effect of excess light on colony size and photosynthetic quantum yield of Microcystis spp. during a summer bloom	Variation of Microcystis spp. (Cyanobacteria) colony size and photosynthetic quantum yield were examined during a summer bloom in a large shallow lake (Lake Taihu). After exposure to direct solar radiation for four hours, about 60% of the colonies larger than 36 μm had changed into smaller colonies and single cells. Meanwhile, the photosynthetic quantum yields of Microcystis spp. decreased rapidly. Under a treatment of 30% of the light intensity of that at the surface, only about 10% of the large colonies changed into smaller colonies and single cells, and the photosynthetic quantum yields showed only a slight decrease. When the samples were incubated at the surface layer and 0.5 m depth from 0800 h to 1800 h, the number of small colonies and single cells increased more markedly than that at 1.0 m depth. During this incubation, the photosynthetic quantum yields of the Microcystis spp. at the surface water were significantly lower than that at the 0.5 m and 1.0 m depths from 1000 h to 1800 h. Direct exposure to excess light severely reduced the photosynthetic quantum efficiency of the Microcystis spp. cells but also induced large Microcystis spp. colonies to change into smaller ones and single cells.

79251511198	Cyanobacteria bloom prediction model and parameters optimization based on genetic algorithm	Cyanobacteria bloom prediction is very important for water crisis and water resource security. Technique of dynamic spatial environmental modelling is used to develop cyanobacteria bloom prediction model used in three bays (Meiliang Bay, Zhushan Bay, Gong Bay) of northern Taihu Lake. The initial model parameters are obtained from field observation. The four parameters highly sensitive in chlorophyll-a concentration prediction are determined using Genetic Algorithm optimization technique. The observed field data of water environment and meteorological conditions in Taihu Lake from April to September 2008 are used for this purpose. The results showed that, Genetic Algorithm is comprehensive and efficient in optimizing model parameters, thus effective in improving prediction accuracy of the model and the relative residual decreases.

79952718692	The characteristics and buoyancy regulations of cyanobacterial gas vesicles	Gas vesicles are important factor for the occurrence of cyanobacterial water-bloom, which provide varying buoyancy for cyanobacteria to obtain favorable growth conditions. Therefore, it is important to understand the characteristics of gas vesicle for cyanobacteria water-bloom control. In this article, we introduced the research history of gas vesicle, and then conducted a systematic review about gas vesicle morphology, the relationship between the cylinder radius and critical pressure, the measurement approach of gas vesicle volume and its chemical features. Gas vesicle was discovered by Klebahn in 1895 and this name was officially accepted in 1965. So far, gas vesicles have been found in more than 150 prokaryotes. Gas vesicle shape is described as a cylinder with two cones on two ends and its cylinder radius is closely related to critical pressure following the equation; P

79955107730	The abundance of microcystin-producing and non-microcystin-producing Microcystis populations in the water column and sediment during a water bloom in Lake Taihu	The abundances of microcystin-producing and total Microcystis populations in the water column and surface sediment in Lake Taihu during water bloom were investigated by using quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR). Results showed that microcystin-producing and total Microcystis, in both the water column and sediment, were more abundant in Zhushan Bay and Meiliang Bay than in Gonghu Bay and the center of the lake. The proportion of toxic Microcystis species to the total Microcystis populations in water column from Zhushan Bay, Meiliang Bay, Gonghu Bay, and the center of the lake were 41.12%, 40.25%, 28.53%, and 9.36%, respectively. In sediment, toxic Microcystis species accounted for 6.51%, 8.49%, 5.14%, and 2.22% of the total Microcystis populations in those four lake regions, respectively. In conclusion, the abundance and composition of Microcystis differed spatially in the water column and surface sediment in Lake Taihu during the water bloom. The abundances of toxic and total Microcystis populations in the water column and sediment are relatively high in the high trophic lake regions and, in parallel, the proportion of toxic Microcystis to total Microcystis population is also high when the water body has a high trophic level. In addition, toxic Microcystis occupied much more of the total Microcystis in the water column than in sediment.

79954518323	Analysis of meteorological factors of forming feculent and anaerobic water aggregation induced by algal bloom in Taihu Lake	The water quality pollution problem about feculent and anaerobic water aggregation (FAWA) induced by algal bloom in Taihu Lake, which is often called 'hufan' in Chinese, was studied. Its forming process is divided into 3 phases, i.e., material elements forming of FAWA, anaerobic products to be brought to the water surface and the maintaining of FAWA in the water surface. The conventional observational data from Wuxi meteorological station was analyzed. The result shows that there are similar meteorological characteristics of two FAWA phenomena in Taihu Lake in May, 2007 and May, 2008. A numerical simulation was performed to prove the analysis results. It indicates that propitious meteorological condition is one of the necessary forming factors of FAWA, which provides thermal and dynamical environment for FAWA. During the first phase, the weather conditions, such as high air temperature, gentle breeze and nearly invariable wind direction, maintain for more than 3 days and cause algal bloom to aggregate, then die, sink and anaerobic decay near lake bank. All these provide the precondition for FAWA. During the second phase, when the cold air mass passes across the Taihu basin, almost counter-direction wind, which maintains for more than 1 day with higher speed and lower air temperature, makes anaerobic products to be brought to the water surface by uplifted current. This is the trigger mechanism of FAWA. During the last phase, continual high air temperature and gentle breeze is favorable for FAWA in the water surface. Because meteorological factors are predictable, this research provides a way and basis for the further study of warning and controlling approaches of FAWA.

0036120039	Effects of aluminum on physiological metabolism and antioxidant system of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)	The Al-tolerant cultivar TAM202 and the Al-sensitive cultivar TAM105 of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were exposed to 0, 50, 75, 100 or 150 μM of Al. The absorption of Al by wheat, the growth of root, several key enzymes concerned with C, N and P metabolism, as well as key constituents of antioxidant system, were investigated. The results showed that TAM105 absorbed more Al than TAM202 and its root growth (presented by the length) was inhibited more severely. The root growth was most closely related to mononuclear Al (Ala) activity. The metabolic enzymes (presented by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, nitrate reductase and acid phosphatase) in TAM202 were Al-tolerant. Presented by superoxide dimutase (SOD) and the content of reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), antioxidant system in TAM202 indicated lower oxidative stress and greater ability to protect the cultivar. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

79959797996	Role of conony intercellular space in the cyanobacteria bloom-forming	Gas vesicle is considered a major factor providing buoyancy for cyanobacteria ascending. However, whether other buoyancy contributing factors exist is still unclear. In this study, we combined indoor bloom simulation and field experiments to explore the impact of intercellular spaces on algal bloom formation. Indoor bloom simulation studies indicated that cyanobacteria exist as single cells when floating, but form small colonies at port 6. Cell ballast analysis [exopolysaccharide (EPS), cellular dry weight, protein, etc.] showed that EPS exhibits the most rapid change rate and the maximum level of cyanobacteria rises at port 6, which were 3.02, 10.38 and 15.73 pg/cell in three tests respectively. Field algae investigation revealed abundant intercellular spaces within algal colonies. When the field colonies were treated with 1.0 MPa pressure and ultrasonic processor at 40 Hz for 1 min, respectively, intercellular spaces disappeared and gas vesicles collapsed under 1.0 MPa pressure, causing increasing cyanobacteria failure. Under sonication, algal colonies were broken down into single cells that became suspended in water, but gas vesicles remained intact. These results suggested that single algal cells aggregate into colonies through EPS and form intercellular spaces to provide buoyancy, which is one of the major factors for bloom formation.

The length and diameter of gas vesicle, relative gas vesicle volume, appear pressure values, critical pressure values, cell turgor values were measured, and the correlations among these characters, gvpA copies, and repeated sequences of gvpC were analyzed. The results indicate that there are a significant positive linear correlation between gvpA copies and relative gas vesicle volume (r=0.999); gvpA copies are negatively correlated with diameter of gas vesicle (r =-0.861). However, repeated sequences of gvpC have a significant positive correlation with diameter of gas vesicle (r=0.911), and have significant negative correlations with relative gas vesicle volume, appear pressure values and critical pressure values, with the correlation coefficient of -0.851, -0.999, -0.928 respectively. So we presume that gvpA copies are probably the primary impact factor for relative gas vesicle volume. The diameter of gas vesicle is not only regulated by repeated sequences of gvpC, but also regulated by gvpA copies.

Primer sets based on the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA) and the microcystin synthetase gene (mcyD) were used to target the total Microcystis population and the potential microcystin-producing subpopulation, respectively. The results showed that Microcystis existed as a mixed population of potentially toxic and non-toxic genotypes in two lakes.

80054033877	Dynamics of dissolved organic carbon after a cyanobacterial bloom in hypereutrophic Lake Taihu (China)	To establish the influence of the cyanobacterial bloom collapse on the characteristics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Lake Taihu, high-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter (HMW-DOM), with sizes between 1. kDa and 0.5μm, were collected using cross-flow ultrafiltration, from three different eutrophic regions. Isolated HMW-DOM was further characterized by atomic carbon to nitrogen ratio and neutral sugars composition by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The results indicated that the cyanobacterial cell lysis induced by nitrate depletion is the likely mechanism for DOC release. The relatively high DOC level was associated with the high chlorophyll a concentration in Meiliang Bay, one of the most eutrophic bays in the northern part of the lake. However, no significant correlations were observed between chlorophyll a concentration and HMW-DOC concentration during the demise of the cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Taihu. No significant differences were found in the HMW-DOC concentration among the three sampling sites, which were selected to represent different eutrophic status. However, a significant difference in the HMW-DOC concentration was found between October 2009 and January 2010 in all three sampling sites (p=0.02). The HMW-DOC release may be attributed to the cyanobacterial cell lysis after the peak of summer bloom. The similarity in neutral sugar composition between the HMW-DOM and cyanobacterial exopolysaccharides suggests that the cyanobacterial bloom is the source of HMW-DOM. However, the significant correlation between the carbon to nitrogen ratio in HMW-DOM and chlorophyll a concentration was only observed in Meiliang Bay, which implies that apart from the cyanobacteria-derived DOC, a fraction of DOC was from riverine input. The decline of the cyanobacterial bloom also changed the overall DOM pool, leading to a shift in the component of HMW-DOM from a C-enriched material to an N-enriched material, as revealed by the variation in the carbon to nitrogen ratios. Overall, these results demonstrate that the quantitative and qualitative DOM is affected by the post-cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Taihu. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Cell densities of C. pyrenoidosa exposed to D. carinata water and short-term D. carinata grazing were significantly higher than those in the control; theoretic maximum cell densities of C. pyrenoidosa in the two treatments were also higher than those in the control, which indicated that grazing-associated infochemicals by D. carinata may enhance the alga's growth. Esterase activities in the two treatments were significantly higher than those in the control, which may contribute to the rapid growth of C. pyrenoidosa exposed to D. carinata infochemicals. Chlorophyll fluorescence and cell size were not significantly influenced by D. carinata infochemicals and grazing. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

82555200999	Nitrate limitation and accumulation of dissolved organic carbon during a spring-summer cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Taihu (China)	To establish the effect of the spring-summer cyanobacterial bloom on the characteristics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Lake Taihu, high-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter (HMW-DOM), with sizes between 1 kDa and 0.2 μm, were collected using cross-flow ultrafiltration, from three different eutrophic regions. The DOC, and HMW-DOC concentrations, as well as environmental factors, including water temperature, nitrate, phosphate, and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), were analyzed. A significant negative relationship was observed between Chl-a and nitrate concentration, suggesting that cyanobacterial bloom was limited by nitrate. The high phosphate concentration can probably be attributed to phosphorus released from the sediment or can be a result of the accumulation of bloom. Furthermore, DOC concentration significantly increased with water temperature, and was negatively related to nitrate concentration, indicating that these two environmental factors are well correlated to DOC dynamics. DOC concentration did not significantly corresponded with the Chl-a concentration in Lake Taihu. Moreover, the relationship between HMW-DOC and Chl-a concentration was only observed in Gonghu Bay, suggesting that DOC and HMW-DOC are not solely derived from cyanobacterial bloom. Other organic carbon origins, such as terrestrial input, were also assumed to play an important role in Lake Taihu.

82955165736	The community structure and abundance of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria in surface sediment of lake taihu in winter	Lake Taihu is a large, shallow, eutrophic freshwater lake, which has frequently experienced cyanobacterial bloom in summer in the past decades. In winter, a large quantity of cyanobacterial cells sink on the sediment surface to overwinter. Therefore, it is important to quantify the biomass of cyanobacteria on the sediment to predict the location and the extent of water bloom in summer. However it is difficult to identify and to count cyanobacterial cells in sediment using microscopy method, and microscopic identification cannot differentiate between the toxigenic and non-toxigenic genotypes. In recent years, this problem has been resolved by using molecular techniques such as PCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) with primers targeting toxin-producing genes. The microcystin gene cluster which contains 10 genes, namely from mcyA to mcyJ has been widely used to reveal microcystin-producing species in genera Anabaena, Microcystis and Planktothrix. Detection of cyanobacteria and their toxin-producing ability using molecular methods has been successfully applied to a diverse range of water and sediment environments. In this study, we use quantitative real time PCR to quantify the abundance of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria and Microcystis, and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique to investigate the community structure of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria in surface sediment of Lake Taihu in winter. qPCR data showed that Microcystis and microcystin-producing cyanobacteria were present in all of sediment samples and their abundance varied significantly in different lake areas, ranging from 1. 23×104 copies/ g dry weight to 3. 75×106 copies/ g dry weight and from 2. 56 ×104 to 1. 07 ×107 copies/ g dry weight, respectively. The proportion of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria to Microcystis ranged from 4. 8% to 35. 2%. DGGE patterns indicated that the composition of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria were very similar in surface sediments collected from different lake areas, and the similarity values were between 70. 2% and 96. 0%. Although the composition of genotypes of microcystin- producing cyanobacteria slightly varied among samples, the dominant band is same. The number of dominant band was negatively correlated with Shannon index. Taking into consideration of qPCR analysis and the concentration of Chlorophyll-a and Phycocyanin, we concluded that in the winter of 2010 cyanobacteria of Lake Taihu mainly overwinter in four lake areas, Mei liang bay, Zhu shan bay,Gong hu bay and center part of Lake Taihu. Our results showed that quantitative real time PCR is a feasible method to investigate the dynamics of toxic cyanobacteria in lake sediment.

In this study, we performed real time PCR assays to investigate the densities of the potential toxic subpopulation and the total Microcystis in Lake Chaohu, targeting the microcystin synthetase gene (mcyD) and the phycocyanin intergeic spacer, respectively. Water samples were collected from seven sampling sites, including a transect from eastern to western lake along with different trophic levels. QPCR data showed a marked spatio-temporal difference in the abundance of toxic and non-toxic Microcystis, which was much higher in summer than in winter and as well as in west lake areas than in east lake areas. The proportion of toxic Microcystis in total Microcystis population ranged from 8.4% to 65.8% and from 0.5% to 8.1%, in summer and winter, respectively. Using high-pressure liquid chromatography with diode array detection, we found that the concentration and composition of three microcystin variants (MC-RR, MC-YR, and MC-LR) varied significantly in different sampling sites.

84355162748	Contributions of meteorology to the phenology of cyanobacterial blooms: Implications for future climate change	Cyanobacterial blooms are often a result of eutrophication. Recently, however, their expansion has also been found to be associated with changes in climate. To elucidate the effects of climatic variables on the expansion of cyanobacterial blooms in Taihu, China, we analyzed the relationships between climatic variables and bloom events which were retrieved by satellite images. We then assessed the contribution of each climate variable to the phenology of blooms using multiple regression models. Our study demonstrates that retrieving ecological information from satellite images is meritorious for large-scale and long-term ecological research in freshwater ecosystems. Our results show that the phenological changes of blooms at an inter-annual scale are strongly linked to climate in Taihu during the past 23 yr. Cyanobacterial blooms occur earlier and last longer with the increase of temperature, sunshine hours, and global radiation and the decrease of wind speed. Furthermore, the duration increases when the daily averages of maximum, mean, and minimum temperature each exceed 20.3 °C, 16.7 °C, and 13.7 °C, respectively. Among these factors, sunshine hours and wind speed are the primary contributors to the onset of the blooms, explaining 84.6% of their variability over the past 23 yr. These factors are also good predictors of the variability in the duration of annual blooms and determined 58.9% of the variability in this parameter. Our results indicate that when nutrients are in sufficiently high quantities to sustain the formation of cyanobacterial blooms, climatic variables become crucial in predicting cyanobacterial bloom events. Climate changes should be considered when we evaluate how much the amount of nutrients should be reduced in Taihu for lake management. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84856611246	Changes in abundance and community structure of bacteria associated with buoyant Microcystis colonies during the decline of cyanobacterial bloom (autumn-winter transition)	The structure and composition of the bacterial community associated with buoyant Microcystis colonies were monitored during the decline of a cyanobacterial bloom (from October 13, 2009 to January 27, 2010). When temperature decreased, the ratio between the colony-associated bacteria and the Microcystis gradually decreased as estimated by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based approach. Diversity of bacterial communities was determined through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Cluster analysis of the DGGE profiles showed that most of the bacterial communities associated with Microcystis colonies collected on the nearby dates were clustered together. The bacterial clones from four clone libraries in different months were classified into 5, 12, 6 and 12 operational taxonomic units, most of which were affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Shift in dominance from pathogenic Aeromonas sp. to Shewanella sp. capable of remineralization of many organic materials was observed, and both species seemed to be associated with Microcystis colonies along with the bloom decline. These results indicated that the potential harmful effects of the Microcystis bloom on the safety of lake water during the decline period should be taken into account. © 2011 EDP Sciences.

Nutrient levels were higher in the west than that in the east, but Chlorophyll a did not show the same pattern, implying that the distribution of phytoplankton was affected by other factors. Furthermore, the dissolved organic carbon concentration was related to nitrate concentration. On average, total dissolved carbohydrates was the predominant carbon species, accounting for 26% of the dissolved organic carbon, whereas dissolved polysaccharides and dissolved monosaccharides comprised 21% and 6%, respectively. No significant relationship was observed between Chlorphyll a, dissolved organic carbon and various carbohydrates, suggesting that the resource of dissolved organic carbon and carbohydrates was more than phytoplankton during cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Chaohu.

Particulate organic carbon, high and low molecular weight dissolved organic carbon concentrations, as well as Chlorophyll a concentration were analyzed. The isolated High Molecular Weight Dissolved Organic Matter (HMW-DOM) was further characterized by atomic carbon to nitrogen ratio and neutral sugars composition. The results indicated that particulate organic carbon was the predominant species of carbon in Lake Taihu. The statistical results showed a significant correlation between the concentrations of Chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon, indicating that phytoplankton was the main source of organic carbon. Moreover, significant difference of carbon to nitrogen ratio was observed between particulate organic matter and HMW-DOM. The high value of carbon to nitrogen ratio and neutral sugars concentration suggested that HMW-DOM is highly bioreactive.

84865302746	Photochemical responses of phytoplankton to rapid increasing-temperature process	Phytoplankton is sensitive to rapidly increasing temperature in spring. However, studies on the effect of temperature on phytoplankton have mainly focused on constant temperatures. It is necessary to clarify the determining parameters of phytoplankton shifts during temperature increases, as temperatures are predicted to fluctuate more intensively and frequently in the future. In the study, we analyzed the responses of photosynthetic properties and growth in a cyanobacterium (Microcystis aeruginosa) and a green alga (Chlorella pyrenoidosa), the dominant species in Taihu, to rapid increasing-temperature process in the laboratory and in the field. The results show that gradually increasing temperature inhibited photosynthesis and the growth of C. pyrenoidosa and had almost no effect on M. aeruginosa. Elevated increasing temperature range also had more significant effects on the photosynthetic properties and growth rates of C. pyrenoidosa than those of M. aeruginosa in the laboratory and in the field. All of these results suggest that the photosynthetic performance of M. aeruginosa is more suitable to gradually increasing temperature and relatively strong temperature variations than that of C. pyrenoidosa, which might partially contribute to Microcystis excluding Chlorella competitively in aquatic ecosystem. Our findings point out the possible importance of the rapid and dramatic increasing-temperature process to the formation of cyanobacterial blooms. © 2012 Japanese Society of Phycology.

Cyanobacterial samples were collected from eight sites of both Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu in late summer to determine the diversity and distribution pattern of cyanobacteria and Microcystis in large, shallow, entropic lakes with significant spatial heterogeneity and long-term Microcystis bloom. Molecular methods based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and clone library analysis were used. A similar heterogeneous distribution pattern of cyanobacteria in both lakes was observed. Most parts of these two lakes with high trophic level were dominated by Microcystis. However, in the regions with low trophic levels as well as low concentrations of chlorophyll a, Synechococcus occupied a considerable percentage. Different morphospecies and genotypes dominated the bloom-forming Microcystis populations in these two lakes.

We speculated that Microcystis genotype succession could play an important role in adaptation to environmental changes and long-term maintenance of the high Microcystis biomass. In this study, we investigated Microcystis genotype succession pattern and the related environmental variables in Lake Taihu during cyanobacterial blooms. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of polymerase chain reaction -amplified the genus-specific cpcBA and mcyJ gene fragments was used to monitor the variations of Microcystis genotype and potential microcystin (MC)-producing Microcystis genotype compositions during blooms biweekly in three sites (Meiliang Bay, lake center, and Gonghu Bay) and CANOCO 4. 5 for Windows were used for the multivariate statistical analysis of their relationships to environmental variables. DGGE patterns indicated that the number of dominant cpcBA genotype per sample increased from spring to autumn. Principal component analysis ordination plots of DGGE profiles showed clear temporal distribution pattern, but not spatial distribution pattern based on both cpcBA and mcyJ genotype compositions. These results indicated there were relatively gradual successions of Microcystis cpcBA and mcyJ genotype compositions in each site, and no distinct spatial difference among the three sites. Redundancy analyses of the gel patterns showed that, in all the three sites, three environmental factors (nitrate, pH, and chemical oxygen demand) were correlated significantly to successions of both cpcBA and mcyJ genotypes except for mcyJ genotype in the lake center. Spearman's correlations indicated that the three environmental variables were also strongly correlated with chl a and MC concentrations. These results suggested that the environmental factors affecting succession of Microcystis community composition might also influence the growth of Microcystis and MC production. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84869216713	Specific association between bacteria and buoyant Microcystis colonies compared with other bulk bacterial communities in the eutrophic Lake Taihu, China	The diversity of buoyant Microcystis colony-associated, settling particle-associated and free-living freshwater bacteria in the eutrophic Lake Taihu in China was compared by the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes and by clone library analysis. The cluster analysis of DGGE profiles revealed that the buoyant Microcystis colony associates collected in summer and winter were clustered together and were distinct from settling particle-associated and free-living bacteria. In contrast, the bacterial communities of the latter two populations collected in summer were clustered together and varied from those collected in winter. The diversity indices of the Microcystis-associated bacterial population were significantly lower than those of the other two bulk bacterial communities (P<0.05). Clone library analysis revealed that no shared operational taxonomic units were found in the three populations. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that buoyant Microcystis-associated bacteria were distinct from the other communities and that they were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were prevalent in all three habitats. Other bacterial taxa such as Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, Gemmatimonadetes and Acidobacteria were associated with settling particles and with the water column. Buoyant Microcystis colonies, settling particles and the water column in the eutrophic lake are thus inhabited by different bacterial flora. In addition, specific bacterial communities are associated with buoyant Microcystis colonies. © 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84870739532	Temporal-spatial changes in community structure and abundance of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria in surface sediments of Lake Taihu	In order to investigate the temporal-spatial changes in community structure and abundance of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria in surface sediments (0~3 cm) of Lake Taihu, Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) was used to investigate the community structure of potential toxic cyanobacteria and quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) was used to analyze the dynamics of this population based on the presence of the mcyA gene in sediment samples. Sediment samples were collected in eight locations in winter (February), spring (April) and summer (June) of 2011. The results revealed that toxic cyanobacteria were widely distributed in all sediment samples; PCR-DGGE profile patterns showed that there were temporal-spatial changes in community structure of toxic cyanobacteria and the community composition similarity varied from 67% to 97% in the composition of mcyA genotypes in sediment samples; Shannon diversity index of toxic cyanobacteria in winter, spring and summer gradually decreased, and the values ranged from 2.774 to 3.392, from 1.649 to 2.619 and from 0.681 to 1.996, respectively; and Shannon diversity index was negatively correlated with the ratio of dominant genotype in sediment samples (p<0.01, r=-0.95). QPCR data suggested that the abundance of mcyA genotypes in sediment samples gradually decreased from winter to summer as a result of cyanobacteria entering into water column from sediment. The dynamics and composition of toxic cyanobacteria in surface sediment were related to temperature, irradiance, DO content, conductivity and pH.

84871024150	The distribution of phytoplankton along trophic gradients and its mediation by available light in the pelagic zone of large eutrophic lakes	We describe the pattern and the principal factors affecting the phytoplankton biomass-nutrient relationship in the pelagic zone of large lakes. The results showed that the phytoplankton abundance and biomass of Cyanophyta, Cryptophyta, and Pyrrophyta were significantly correlated with trophic states. The total phosphorus (TP)- biomass relationship curves showed that the increment of biomass with TP is weak at high TP levels. The decrease in biomass at the high end of the curves might be a synthesis of the pattern of responses of the major taxonomic groups (except cyanobacteria) to environmental variables. Light limitation might be one of the important factors causing the decrease in the TP-biomass curve at high TP concentrations. If the mean underwater available light is lower than ~250 μmol photons·m

84873537424	Growth characteristics of algae during early stages of phytoplankton bloom in Lake Taihu, China	Three treatments, sediment plus lake water (S+W), sterilized sediment plus lake water (SS+W), and sediment plus filtered lake water (S+FW), were recruited to investigate the growth characteristics of algae during pre-bloom and the importance of algal inocula in the water column and sediment. The results showed that in the water column, biomass of all algae increased in all treatments when recruitment was initiated, whereas this tendency differed among treatments with further increment of temperature. The process of algal growth consisted of two stages: Stage I, the onset of recruitment and Stage II, the subsequent growth of algae. Compared with S+W, in Stage I, SS+W significantly increased the biomass of cyanophytes by 178.70%, and decreased the biomass of non-cyanophytes by 43.40%; In Stage II, SS+W notably stimulated the growth of all algae, thus incurring the occurrence of phytoplankton bloom. Further analyses revealed that both metabolic activity and photochemical activity of algae were enhanced in SS+W, which resulted from the releasing of nutrients from sediment. These results suggest that algal growth in Stage II and algal inocula in the water column can be important factors for the formation of phytoplankton bloom. In addition, possible mechanisms promoting algal recruitment and subsequent growth of algae were explored. © 2013 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

84873150785	Effects of the rice straw on microcystis aeruginosa analyzed by different physiological parameters	The growth and physiology of bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa were determined by the flow cytometry when exposed to rice straw extract for 15 d. The cell growth, cell integrity, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and esterase activity were used to evaluate the physiological response in Microcystis aeruginosa. Rice straw extract stored for 5 days significantly inhibited the growth of Microcystis aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent way; Most of the algae cells (>98%) remained complete membranes in all the concentration treatments; Compared with the control cultures, the rice straw induced both negative and positive effects on the esterase activity for each test within 4 days, while the inhibition exceeded the stimulation effect. After a 7 d exposure, only the inhibition effect was found. Neither the inhibited nor stimulated effects was observed after algae exposure from 10 d to 15 d. Evident changes was found in the membrane potential during 7 d experiment, whereas inhibition effect became weaker after 10 d and 15 d exposure, in consistent with the result of esterase activity. These results confirmed that the rice straw extract might provide both dominant inhibition and relatively weak stimulation effects. After a long time exposure, inhibition effect became limited while stimulation effect disappeared. The action of rice straw may be algistatic (preventing algal growth) but not algicidal (killing algae).

84875877643	The discussion of the early forecasting of cyanobacteria bloom in the Lake Taihu based on ELCOM-CAEDYM model	An ecological dynamic model for cyanobacteria bloom in Taihu Lake was structwed based on the theory of "four phases of cyanobacteria bloom development" and the coupling model of ELCOM-CAEDYM developed by Centre for Water Research, University of Western Australia. The cyanobacteria bloom development was modeled and the possibility for early forecast of cyanobacteria bloom in Taihu Lake was discussed. The model outputs met well with the cyanobacteria biomass in a large temporal scale covering the phases of anabiosis, growth and upfloat. The differences between modeled data and field-determined (or surveyed) ones varied in the range 1.0%~70.4% with a mean of 28.0%. The differences between modeled data and the inferred ones from MODIS satellite imagery varied in the range 3.8%~83.9% with a mean of 40.5%. However, the model outputs weakly reflected the cyanobacteria biomass in the phase of overwintering, the differences ranged from 3.0% to 143.6% with a mean of 40.1% between modeling data and the field-determined ones, and from 9.7% to 118.4% with a mean of 48.8% between the modeled data and the inferred ones from MODIS satellite imagery. The simulation of cyanobacteria overwintering need to be improved to better serve the early forecast of cyanobacteria bloom.

84877064157	Use of flow cytometric sorting to assess the diversity of eukaryotic picophytoplankton of lakes	A novel approach based on flow cytometric sorting followed by construction of 18S rRNA clone libraries was used to study the diversity of eukaryotic picophytoplankton of lakes. The composition of eukaryotic picophytoplankton community appeared highly variable in three lakes. Eukaryotic picophytoplankton was dominated by Cryptophyta in the Lake Xuanwu, and was mainly composed of Cryptophyta and Chrysophyta in the Lake Zixia. In the Lake Taihu, four phyla were discovered, including Cryptophyta, Chrysophyta, Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta. Meanwhile, the diversity of eukaryotic picophytoplankton differed in various lake regions. In the Meiliang Bay, Chrysophyta was the dominant, and the other three phyla were found in the Gonghu Bay. In the central lake, all of those four phyla were discovered, implying this region contained the highest diversity. The canonical correspondence analysis between the diversity of eukaryotic picophytoplankton and environmental factors revealed the concentration of total phosphorus had the highest important impact on the eukaryotic picophytoplankton communities.

84878896152	Inhibition of Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze on Microcystis aeruginosa and isolation of the inhibition factors	Low concentration of tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) was shown to inhibit the growth of the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. The inhibition efficiency was 40 % at 0.1 g dry tea/L and 90 % at 0.2 g/L after a 12-day culture. All varieties of tea used in the test could inhibit Microcystis growth, in which the inhibitory effect of green tea was greater than that of black tea. Antialgal allelochemicals were isolated from tea by solvent extraction, gel-chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. Two algal-inhibition compounds were identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry as epigallocatechin-3-gallate, epicatechin-3-gallate respectively. These are the main polyphenols in tea that have inhibitory effects on the growth of cyanobacteria. The combined effect of these polyphenols makes tea a promising source of algicide to inhibit the growth of algal blooms. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84880054093	Abiotic factors in colony formation: Effects of nutrition and light on extracellular polysaccharide production and cell aggregates of Microcystis aeruginosa	Colony morphology is important for Microcystis to sustain a competitive advantage in eutrophic lakes. The mechanism of colony formation in Microcystis is currently unclear. Extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) has been reported to play an important role in cell aggregate formation of some phytoplankton. Microcystis aeruginosa was cultivated under varied abiotic conditions, including different nutrient, light, and temperature conditions, to investigate their effects on EPS production and morphological change. The results show that nutrient concentration and light intensity have great effects on EPS productionin M. aeruginosa. There was a considerable increase in EPS production after M. aeruginosa was cultivated in adjusted culture conditions similar to those present in the field (28.9 mg C/L, 1.98 mg N/L, 0.65 mg P/L, light intensity: 100 μmol/(m

84884417404	Differences in microcystin production and genotype composition among microcystis colonies of different sizes in Lake Taihu	The cyanobacterium Microcystis, which occurs as colonies of different sizes under natural conditions, can produce toxic microcystins (MCs). To monitor the toxicity and assess the risk of Microcystis blooms in Lake Taihu, it is important to investigate the relationship between MC production and Microcystis colony size. In this study, we classified Microcystis collected from Zhushan Bay of Lake Taihu during blooms into four classes with size of <50μm, 50-100μm, 100-270μm and >270μm and studied their differences in MC production and genetic structure. The results showed that colonies with size of <50, 50-100, 100-270 and >270μm produced 12.2±11.2%, 19.5±7.9%, 61.3±12.6%, and 7.0±9.6% of total MC, respectively. The proportion of cell density of colonies with size of 50-100, 100-270 and >270μm was positively correlated with MC concentration during blooms, while that of colonies with size of <50μm was negatively correlated. The MC cell quota tended to be higher during blooms in colonies with larger size except that of colonies with size of 100-270μm was higher than that of colonies with size of >270μm from June 11 to September 16. Colonies with size of <50μm showed the highest proportion of the less toxic MC congener MC-RR, and colonies with size of >100μm showed higher proportion of the most toxic MC congener MC-LR than colonies with size of <100μm. Real-time PCR indicated that larger colonies had higher proportion of potential toxic genotype. Principal component analysis of PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profile showed that cpcBA and mcyJ genotype compositions were different between colonies with size of <50μm and colonies with size of >50μm, and cpcBA genotype composition was also different among colonies with size of 50-100μm, 100-270μm and >270μm. These results indicated that MC cell quota and congener composition were different in Microcystis colonies with different sizes in Lake Taihu during blooms, and the differences in MC production in colonies with different size resulted chiefly from the difference in their genotype composition. Therefore, the authorities of water quality monitoring and drinking water supply service in Lake Taihu should be alert that the toxicity of Microcystis colony with different size was different during blooms, and the high abundance of colonies larger than 50μm could be an indicator of relatively high bloom toxicity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84885058764	Genetic diversity of picoeukaryotic phytoplankton in the lakes along the middle-lower reaches of the Yangtze River	The genetic diversity of picoeukaryotic phytoplankton in the 30 lakes along the middle-lower reaches of the Yangtze River was studied using flow cytometry combined with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). The objectives of this study were to confirm the variance in the genetic diversity of picoeukaryotic phytoplankton among the lakes and to reveal its main affecting factors. Though the lakes investigated tended to or already were eutrophic, T-RFLP profiles of 18S rRNA gene fragments from picoeukaryotic phytoplankton showed high diversity. There were altogether 197 T-RFs detected from the lakes that we investigated, with 89 of them obtained in less than 3 lakes. Cluster analysis indicated their similarity was lower than 80%. Shannon-wiener diversity index showed that mesotrophic lakes contained more diverse picoeukaryotic phytoplankton community than eutrophic lakes. The canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the concentration of the total nitrogen had the most important impact on the picoeukaryotic phytoplankton communities (P=0.006). The results showed that the genetic diversity of picoeukaryotic phytoplankton in the lakes were of great environmental heterogeneity and closely related to the trophic status. Two CCA axes can only explain 10.0% of the total variance in picoeukaryotic phytoplankton composition, suggesting that the evolution of picoeukaryotic phytoplankton was probably connected to the top-down manipulation as well.

The results showed that both picocyanobacteria and bloom-forming cyanobacteria have high levels of diversity. Microcystis and Anabaena were the two predominant bloom-forming genera, and two obvious shifts occurred between them from spring to winter. Anabaena was dominant in spring, then it was rapidly replaced by Microcystis in summer and became dominant again in late autumn and early winter.

First, water and sediment samples were incubated in the laboratory to determine the threshold temperature for cyanobacteria recruitment. Second, the functional characteristics of candidate algicides were screened. Third, an in situ pilot experiment was conducted to test the feasibility of this method.

84894296715	Effects of rice straw on the cell viability, photosynthesis, and growth of Microcystis aeruginosa	Rice straw is supposed to be an environment-friendly biomaterial for inhibiting the growth of harmful blooms of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. However, its potential mechanism is not well known. To explore this mechanism, the growth, cell viability (esterase activity, membrane potential, and membrane integrity), photosynthesis, and cell size of M. aeruginosa were determined using flow cytometry and Phyto-PAM after exposure to rice straw extracts (RSE). The results show that doses from 2.0 to 10.0 g/L of RSE efficiently inhibited the alga for 15 days, while the physiologic and morphologic responses of the cyanobacteria were time-dependent. RSE interfered with the cell membrane potential, cell size, and in vivo chlorophyll-a fluorescence on the first day. After 7 days of exposure, RSE was transported into the cytosol, which disrupted enzyme activity and photosynthesis. The cyanobacteria then started to repair its physiology (enzyme activity, photosynthesis) and remained viable, suggesting that rice straw act as an algistatic agent. © 2014 Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84896302351	The bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon in the eutrophic lakes	The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool is composed of both autochthonous and allochthonous DOC, and its concentration in lakes generally increases with the trophic status. Accumulation of the autochthonous DOC was observed in the eutrophic lake, and the allochthonous DOC was highest in the dystrophic lake. Carbohydrates constitute a large component of the DOC, the consumption of DOC by heterotrophic bacteria is one of the largest fluxes of carbon in most aquatic ecosystems, but the bioavailability and the efficiency of carbon transfer in lakes food web is affected by the distribution of molecular weight and chemical composition. The DOC can be separated into high and low molecular weight DOC fractions by cross-flow ultrafiltration, but which fraction is more bioreactive is still in dispute. Stable carbon isotope can be used to trace the origins of organic carbon, and the approach depends on the fact that DOC from different origins has different stable isotopic compositions.

84919792662	The dynamics of microcystis genotypes and microcystin production and associations with environmental factors during blooms in lake chaohu, china	Lake Chaohu, which is a large, shallow, hypertrophic freshwater lake in southeastern China, has been experiencing lake-wide toxic Microcystis blooms in recent decades. To illuminate the relationships between microcystin (MC) production, the genotypic composition of the Microcystis community and environmental factors, water samples and associated environmental data were collected from June to October 2012 within Lake Chaohu. The Microcystis genotypes and MC concentrations were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and HPLC, respectively. The results showed that the abundances of Microcystis genotypes and MC concentrations varied on spatial and temporal scales. Microcystis exists as a mixed population of toxic and non-toxic genotypes, and the proportion of toxic Microcystis genotypes ranged from 9.43% to 87.98%. Both Pearson correlation and stepwise multiple regressions demonstrated that throughout the entire lake, the abundances of total and toxic Microcystis and MC concentrations showed significant positive correlation with the total phosphorus and water temperature, suggesting that increases in temperature together with the phosphorus concentrations may promote more frequent toxic Microcystis blooms and higher concentrations of MC. Whereas, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was negatively correlated with the abundances of total and toxic Microcystis and MC concentrations, indicating that rising DIC concentrations may suppress toxic Microcystis abundance and reduce the MC concentrations in the future. Therefore, our results highlight the fact that future eutrophication and global climate change can affect the dynamics of toxic Microcystis blooms and hence change the MC levels in freshwater.

84922219544	Changes in the physiology and gene expression of Microcystis aeruginosa under EGCG stress	EGCG (Epigallocatechin-3-gallate) has an allelopathic inhibitory effect on Microcystis aeruginosa. Cellular structure, physiological and biochemical reactions and gene expression were examined to explore the mechanism of inhibition. As was shown in electron microscopy, the structure of the cell wall, cell membrane and thylakoid was disrupted by EGCG. EGCG also reduced the efficiency of photosynthesis and the electron transfer rate in M. aeruginosa cells, as was determined with a flow cytometer. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that gene expression of the core proteins of the photosynthesis centers PSI and PSII and ATP synthase were reduced, while the expression of the phycobilisome degradation protein A gene (nbl A) was elevated. The expression of the universal stress protein gene increased, which would enhance the adaptive capacity of Microcystis cells to polyphenols and oxidative stress. Furthermore, EGCG elevated the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in M. aeruginosa cells, and thus caused oxidative cellular damage. When treated with EGCG at low concentrations (10 and 40mgL
