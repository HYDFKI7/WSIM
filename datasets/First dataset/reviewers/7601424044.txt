84928596222	Factors affecting consumers' value creation in online group buying	Drawing upon the social capital theory (SCT), this study integrates social capital factors with the perspectives of consumer hedonic participation and platform capability of online group buying sites to explore how they affect consumer value creation toward online group buying (OGB). Data from 663 valid responses were obtained using an online large-scale survey. The conceptual framework was validated by using the partial least squares (PLS) technique. The research findings show that 1) the consumers' value created by engaging in OGB is contributed collectively by social capital factors (i.e., social interaction tie, trust, and shared value), hedonic participation and OGB platform capabilities; 2) the social capital enhances consumers' value creation by increasing their hedonic participation; 3) The OGB platform capabilities has a positive impact on social capital, hedonic participation and value creation. The proposed research model explains 64.1 % of variance for consumers' value creation, 52.6 % of variance for their hedonic participation and 46.1% of variance for social capital in OGB. Our findings provide insights into how OGB administrators can govern OGB initiatives to expand OGB members' social capital and OGB platform capability, thereby leading to effective consumer value creation.

1642337216	A Joint Physical Layer Multi-State Rate Adaptation and Cost-Function Based MAC Scheduling for the WCDMA System	This paper presents a joint physical layer multi-state rate adaptation algorithm combined with MAC scheduling for the WCDMA system. According to the cumulative distribution function of the received signal to noise ratio (SNR), our proposed multi-state rate adaptation scheme determines a set of state transition thresholds to dynamically adjust spreading factors via the transport format (TF) selection procedures in the MAC layer. Moreover, we proposed a cost function based TF selection procedures to incorporate many important factors in both the MAC layer and physical layer, such as service priority, buffer occupancy, and radio link quality. Through a cross-layer design in both the two layers, the proposed cost-function based transport format selection procedures can effectively enhance throughput, save power, and guarantee service fairness for the WCDMA system.

21244477824	A cross-layer cost-function based rate adaptation mechanism for the WCDMA system with multi-class services by transport format selection	The growing demand of high speed multi-class data transmissions poses new challenges on wireless networks. The major objectives of the next generation wireless networks include: (1) achieving high data throughput in the fast varying wireless channel; (2) transmitting multi-class data by service multiplexing; and (3) controlling the delay for delay sensitive service. To achieve these goals, in the context of wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) system, we propose a cost-function based rate adaptation mechanism by taking account of both physical layer channel impacts and higher layer performance parameters, such as buffer occupancy and service priority. We implement this cross-layer rate mechanism by exploiting the transport format (TF) selection procedure in the medium access control (MAC) layer of the WCDMA system. Through the proposed cross-layer cost function, the TF selection procedure can dynamically adapt suitable spreading factors every transmission time interval (TTI), usually 10-80 ms. Through simulations in a flat Rayleigh fading channel, we show that the proposed cross-layer cost-function based rate adaptation mechanism can effectively improve throughput and reduce the buffer occupancy for multi-class services for the WCDMA system at the cost of slightly higher power efficiency.

24644493252	Is manager's training needs: A survey of managerial activity and skill requirements	The purpose of this study was to investigate the important managerial activities and the associated skills of IS managers in various types of industries and levels of management. In this study, survey questionnaire was designed based on the competency model and data were collected via questionnaire administered in Taiwan. Top 2000 firms were the candidates for this study. Of these, 547 firms were selected to participate in this study. The results indicate that 1) there is no perceptual difference among levels of management and types of industry regarding to the relative importance on managerial skills. 2) For the relative importance of managerial activity, there is no perceptual difference among types of industry. However, different levels of management have different perception. Thus, three sets of managerial activities are identified based on the level of management. These findings can serve as criteria for recruiting and promoting IS managers as well as to be an empirical basis for IS manager's management development.

2942685260	A novel link proportional dynamic channel assignment for TDD-CDMA systems with directional antennas	The increasing demands for the higher data rates, the variations of the radio channel, and the inherent traffic asymmetry between the uplink and downlink impose many new challenges on spectrum and radio resource management in wireless networks. Time division duplex (TDD) is an efficient approach to combat the traffic asymmetry issues via adapting the resource (time slots) for uplink and downlink. However, asymmetric traffic will cause cross-slot co-channel interference, which can seriously degrade the system performance. This paper proposes a novel link-proportional dynamical channel assignment (LP-DCA) scheme with directional antennas to alleviate the impact of cross-slot interference in the code division multiple access (CDMA) system. The proposed scheme partitions the whole users in a sector into several groups according to their received link quality. Basically, the LP-DCA assigns the time slots with higher potential cross-slot interference to the group of users with better link quality, or vice versa. Through the simulation, we demonstrate that the LP-DCA can reduce the cross-slot interference significantly, thereby improving the system capacity.

33645314933	Design of self-organizing fuzzy power system stabilizer	Power system stabilizers have been widely used in the electric power industry to improve the power system dynamic stability. This paper proposes a self-organizing fuzzy power system stabilizer (SOFPSS) for the power system which contains two sets of fuzzy inference logic. One is the fuzzy controller and the other is the rule modifier. The fuzzy controller uses IF-THEN fuzzy control rules to control power system. The rule modifier based on negative gradient modification method is a fuzzy learning algorithm that will execute the modification of fuzzy control rules. The modification value of each rule is based on the fuzzy firing weight, so that the fuzzy learning algorithm can proceed reasonably and quickly. Finally, a comparison between a fuzzy power system stabilizer and the proposed SOFPSS is made. The simulation results verify that the proposed SOFPSS can achieve better stabilizing performance than the fuzzy stabilizer since the on-line learning scheme is applied. © 2005 SICE.

36248970696	The application of fuzzy theory for the control of weld line positions in injection-molded part	This research proposes the fuzzy theory for the control of weld lines in plastic injection molding. The weld line occurs as a result of geometrical changes in molded parts in the injection molding process. The weld line is one of the defects present in plastic injection-molded parts; the line affects the quality of parts as well as the strength of the products. In the present study, fuzzy theory was applied in the design of injection molding. First, expert experiences were transformed into I F ∼ T H E N ∼ rules to establish the knowledge base for developing fuzzy inference rules. The rules were then used to adjust the molding parameters, which in turn were applied to control the weld line position in the injection molding process. The results indicate that fuzzy theory exhibited favorable applicability in the control of the weld line as well as decreased the simulation time, thereby accelerating the design process of injection molding. © 2007 ISA.

0032648679	Parametric effects of plates with CLD treatment on vibration suppression	A study of parametric effects on vibration suppression of three-layer plates with viscoelastic core is presented. This study uses a mathematical model that allows the thickness of the constrained layer (CL) and the viscoelastic material (VEM) layer to approach very thin. That model was derived by an energy approach in conjunction with the assumed-modes method. The frequency responses and the resulting damping effects under various compositions of VEM thickness, CL thickness, CL stiffness, and coverage size are discussed. In addition, the case of thickness constrained treatment was also investigated. The results showed that the best selection for the cases investigated is the CL thickness being twice the VEM thickness. In this paper, an index P* for damping measurement is defined. Numerical results also show individual effects of each parameter and provide useful information for designers. According to these parametric effects, readers should get a physical sense of how to select the CLD treatment for best vibration suppression.

38849097888	Supporting vertical handover between universal mobile telecommunications system and wireless LAN for real-time services	The provisioning of the seamless handovers for real-time services in-between UMTS/WLAN loose-interworking by the network-layer technologies has been studied. Issues are how to execute such a vertical handover in a fast and efficient manner as well as how to achieve it in a viable way. To resolve such issues, a novel scheme called 'designated crossover point' (DCP) within the existing IP end-to-end Quality of Servce (QoS) architecture has been proposed. The DCP is an agent at the edge router in the customer's premise to join the old RSVP signalling path and new RSVP signalling path. With the DCP in place, the vertical handover can be greatly accelerated. Besides, by enabling the DCP to handover to the edge router in the customer's network currently visited by the mobile, lower charging cost can be achieved. Finally, there is no modification required for the devices in the provider's network and thus the viability is much improved. It is then end up with a topology for resource management in IP backbone for UMTS/WLAN loose-interworking to support the idea of DCP. To determine when to perform the rerouting to remove the possible derouting caused by DCPs, use of an adaptive rule has been suggested. Simulation results show in general that the adaptive rule is effective. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2008.

32044431660	A study of mechanical behavior of bellows by digital image correlation and strain gages	Bellows are special structures that require high strength as well as good flexibility. The design, manufacture, and analysis of bellow tubes thus are more complicated. Test of bellows to understand their mechanical behavior, and to verify a design purpose finite element program is needed for practical use. In this paper, digital-image-correlation method is applied to measure the stiffness of single- and double-ply bellows under axial compressive load and various internal pressures. The influence of the internal pressure on the stiffness of the bellows is investigated. The meridian and hoop strains at the crest of the bellows are measured by strain gages. The results show that tensile meridian and hoop strains on the single-ply bellows are found as expected. However, the compressive meridian strain is found on the double-ply bellows.

77954263466	PINT: Pathways integration tool	New pathway databases generally display pathways by retrieving information from a database dynamically. Some of them even provide their pathways in SBML or other exchangeable formats. Integrating these models is a challenging work, because these models were not built in the same way. Pathways integration Tool (PINT) may integrate the standard SBML files. Since these files may be obtained from different sources, any inconsistency in component names can be revised by using an annotation editor upon uploading a pathway model. This integration function greatly simplifies the building of a complex model from small models. To get new users started, about 190 curated public models of human pathways were collected by PINT. Relevant models can be selected and sent to the workbench by using a user-friendly query interface, which also accepts a gene list derived from high-throughput experiments. The models on the workbench, from either a public or a private source, can be integrated and painted. The painting function is useful for highlighting important genes or even their expression level on a merged pathway diagram, so that the biological significance can be revealed.

84877898341	Dynamic simulation of thermal-lag Stirling engines	The present study is concerned with dynamic simulation of thermal-lag Stirling engines. A dynamic model is built and incorporated with a thermodynamic model to study the engine start process. A prototype engine is designed and simulated by using the dynamic model. In the simulation, different operating modes, including rotating mode, swinging mode, swinging-to-rotate mode, and swinging-to-decay mode, have been observed. The rotating mode is desired and can be achieved if the operating parameters are properly designed. In a poor design, the engine may switch to the swinging or even the swinging-to-decay mode. In addition, it is found that geometric parameters, such as bore size, stroke, and volume of working spaces, also determine the operating mode of the engine. Brake thermal efficiency of the engine is monotonically reduced by increasing engine speed. However, study of the dependence of the shaft power of the engine speed shows that there exists a maximum value of the shaft power at an optimal operating engine speed. The optimal engine speed leading to maximum shaft power is significantly influenced by the geometrical parameters. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84887248651	Integrated opto-mechanical analysis of a PMMA Fresnel lens for a concentrated photovoltaic system	This study presents the integrated opto-mechanical analysis of a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) Fresnel lens used in solar concentrators for concentrated photovoltaic systems. A solid model of a flat Fresnel lens made of PMMA was constructed based on the design parameters and derived formula of a Fresnel lens. Ray-tracing simulations were used to investigate the two main influences of temperature variation on the Fresnel lens: variations in the refractive index and thermal distortion. The temperature dependence of the refractive index of the PMMA lens was analyzed based on the temperature coefficient of the refractive index (dn/dT). The thermal distortion of the Fresnel lens at various temperature increases was calculated using finite element analysis. The temperature-induced effects, refractive index variation, and deformed lens geometry were then simultaneously imported into a ray-tracing simulation. Thus, this study investigates and discusses the thermal-optical effects of a flat Fresnel lens on its optical performance, including the spot size, the maximum irradiance on the receiver, and the optical efficiency at different temperature increases. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Methods: First, a scale to measure HTM competency was developed and validated, then it was used to collect the large-scale survey data. Second, the partial least squares (PLS) method was used to empirically test the conceptual model and hypotheses through the large-scale survey data collected. Results: The empirical results support the proposed structure for HTM competency encompassing the four skills/knowledge domains: healthcare organization overview, external knowledge networking, healthcare technology integration, and management and interpersonal. The findings indicate that HTM competency positively influences the attitudes of information system (IS) professionals towards their willingness to develop partnerships with healthcare professionals. Conclusions: The findings improve our understanding of the concept of HTM competency and its influence on IT-healthcare partnerships. The conceptual model of HTM is of particular value to those concerned with skills/knowledge training and competency development for IS professionals in healthcare organizations. Healthcare organizations can develop HTM profiles for individual IS professionals in accordance with their own organization contexts. Executive management can take advantage of such HTM profiles to assist in making succession-planning decisions by evaluating the competency levels and development needs of their employees. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

62549139220	The effect of AlN buffer growth parameters on the defect structure of GaN grown on sapphire by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy	The defect structure of GaN film grown on sapphire by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) depends on the growth temperature and thickness of the aluminum nitride (AlN) buffer layer. High-resolution X-ray diffraction was used to measure symmetric (0 0 0 2) and asymmetric (1 0 1̄ 2) rocking curve (ω-scans) broadening, which allowed the estimation of screw threading dislocation (TD) and edge TD densities, respectively. For GaN grown on lower-temperature buffer, the density of screw TD was increased while the density of edge TD was decreased. Further examinations revealed that the edge TD was closely related to stress in GaN film and the screw TD was controlled by AlN surface roughness. Since the GaN defect was dominated by edge TD, the total TD was also effectively suppressed with the use of lower-temperature buffer with appropriate thickness. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

77955995131	A bandwidth-efficient embedded compression algorithm using two-level rate control scheme for video coding system	In modern video coding system, the memory bandwidth of external memory becomes more and more important and almost dominates the system performance. To save the memory bandwidth, the embedded compression (EC) technique is integrated into video coding system. In this paper, the bandwidth-efficient EC algorithm is proposed. It comprises three core techniques: side-oriented prediction, adjusted binary code (ABC) entropy coding, and two-level rate control scheme. The side-oriented prediction can save the extra bits for the representation of prediction residual. The prediction residual is allocated to an efficient codeword by ABC entropy coding. With two-level rate control scheme, not only the compression ratio (CR) can be precisely controlled, but also the visual quality is maintained. Experiment results show this work achieves the PSNR drop of 1.33%, and the error between CR and Target CR (TCR) is as minor as 1.60%. Consequently, this work is quite suitable for saving memory bandwidth in video coding system. ©2010 IEEE.

78650969698	Contact stress analysis of concave conical involute gear pairs with non-parallel axes	This study investigates the contact stress of concave conical involute gear pairs with non-parallel axes by means of finite element analysis. The complete mathematical models of the gear pair, including the working tooth surfaces and the fillets have been derived based on the theory of gearing and the generation mechanism. A mesh-generation program is also developed, which gives a dense mesh in the contact regions and a coarse mesh in the rest of the teeth. The commercial software, ABAQUS, capable of contact analysis of two 3-D deformable bodies is applied to evaluate the stress distribution on the tooth surfaces. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the stress analysis of the gear pairs with various gear design parameters. The results show that the contact stress of non-parallel-axes concave conical involute gear pair can be reduced significantly by choosing grinding wheel with smaller radius. Therefore, concave involute gear pairs relieve the high contact stress problem of non-parallel-axes conventional conical involute gear pairs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

78651474130	Emotion aware system based on acoustic and textual features from speech	In recent years, emotion-aware human-machine interactions have become an important issue. Most of the traditional researches focused on the use of different features and classification methods to improve emotion recognition rates. However, they still cannot recognize detailed and various emotions. Accordingly, in this paper, an emotion recognition system, which combines the acoustic and textual features from speech, is proposed to detect seven emotional states: Joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, worry and disgust, respectively. The AdaBoost approach is also used to learn and classify each emotional state. The experimental result shows that the emotion recognition accuracy of the proposed system is better than that of traditional approaches. ©2010 IEEE.

78651275243	An efficient algorithm for mining time interval-based patterns in large databases	Most studies on sequential pattern mining are mainly focused on time point-based event data. Few research efforts have elaborated on mining patterns from time interval-based event data. However, in many real applications, event usually persists for an interval of time. Since the relationships among event time intervals are intrinsically complex, mining time interval-based patterns in large database is really a challenging problem. In this paper, a novel approach, named as incision strategy and a new representation, called coincidence representation are proposed to simplify the processing of complex relations among event intervals. Then, an efficient algorithm, CTMiner (Coincidence Temporal Miner) is developed to discover frequent time-interval based patterns. The algorithm also employs two pruning techniques to reduce the search space effectively. Furthermore, experimental results show that CTMiner is not only efficient and scalable but also outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2010 ACM.

79952048576	The development of single layer multi-color electrowetting display	Electrowetting display (EWD) is one of the emerging technologies for outdoor multimedia device due to its high contrast ratio, video speed and low power consumption. In this paper, we achieved single layer multi-color EWD by using two different techniques: one is using black oil with color filter, and the other is dosing colored oils into subpixels without adopting color filter. The oil is dosed into the sub-pixel by ink-jet printing (IJP) technique. In order to inject the oil accurately and uniformly, the jetting behavior of different colored oils for IJP was investigated. A 6-inch multi-color EWD panel with black oil and color filter had been successfully made, and a dual color EWD panel with black and red oils had also been fabricated. In the future, fullcolored EWD with colored oils could be achieved with IJP technology.

79954570425	Multi relaxation time lattice Boltzmann simulations of deep lid driven cavity flows at different aspect ratios	In this paper, the multi relaxation time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) was used to compute lid driven cavity flows at different Reynolds numbers (100-7500) and cavity aspect ratios (1-4 cavity width depth). Steady solutions were obtained for square cavity flows, however for deep cavity flows at 1.5 and 4 cavity width depth, unsteady solutions prevail at Re. =7500, where periodic flow exists manifested by the rapid changes of the shapes and locations of the corner vortices in strong contrast of the stationary primary vortex. The merger of the bottom corner vortices into a primary vortex and the reemergence of the corner vortices as the Reynolds number increases are more evident for the deep cavity flows. For the four cavity width depth cavity, four primary vortices were predicted by MRT model for Reynolds number beyond 1000, which were not predicted by previous single relaxation time (SRT) BGK LBE model, and this was verified by complementary Navier-Stokes simulations. Also, MRT model is more suitable for parallel computations than its BGK counterpart, due to the more intense local computations of the multi relaxation time procedure. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79956035268	Tooth contact analysis of a curvilinear gear set with modified pinion tooth geometry	This article investigated the contact behaviours of a modified curvilinear gear set for parallel-axis transmission, which exhibits a pre-designed parabolic transmission error (TE) and localized bearing contact. The proposed gear set is composed of a modified pinion with curvilinear teeth and an involute gear with curvilinear teeth. Tooth contact analysis enabled the authors to explore the influences of assembly errors and design parameters on TEs and contact ellipses of this gear set. It is observed that TEs were continuous and the contact ellipses were localized in the middle of the tooth flanks, even under assembly errors. Finite-element contact analysis was performed to study stress distributions under different design parameters. In addition, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the contact characteristics of the modified curvilinear gear set.

This gear drive exhibits point contact and parabolic transmission error due to the double crowning effect of the gear, i.e. crowning in both profile and longitudinal directions. The principal directions and curvatures of the generating tool surfaces were derived by means of differential geometry and Rodrigues' equation. The principal directions and curvatures of the pinion and gear surfaces were obtained directly from the generating surfaces. Finally, the determination of the contact ellipses of the mating tooth surfaces was achieved. Numerical examples are also provided to demonstrate the computational results.

0036685122	An optimal placement of CLD treatment for vibration suppression of plates	A study on optimal placement of constrained-layer damping (CLD) treatment for vibration suppression of plates is presented. A mathematical model is derived using the energy approach. This model allows both the constraining layer (CL) and the viscoelastic layer (VEM) to be either as thick as the host or very thin. The influence of treatment thickness on damping effects is particularly addressed. From the simulated results, it is found that the best damping performance occurs as the CL thickness is twice that of the VEM thickness. As to the optimization process, an objective function including structural damping ratios, resonant frequencies' shift, and CLD thickness is defined. In optimization, the structural damping plays the main performance index and the frequencies' shift and CLD thickness play as penalty functions. A topographical method in conjunction with the complex method is used to search for the global minimum. Examples are illustrated and the effects of weighting factors are discussed. Individual effects of weighting factors can be useful for designers, since the designers can build up a better sense of how CLD treatment improves the vibration suppression. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

79957443956	Discovery of protein Phosphorylation motifs through exploratory data analysis	Background: The need for efficient algorithms to uncover biologically relevant phosphorylation motifs has become very important with rapid expansion of the proteomic sequence database along with a plethora of new information on phosphorylation sites. Here we present a novel unsupervised method, called Motif Finder (in short, F-Motif) for identification of phosphorylation motifs. F-Motif uses clustering of sequence information represented by numerical features that exploit the statistical information hidden in some foreground data. Furthermore, these identified motifs are then filtered to find "actual" motifs with statistically significant motif scores. Results and Discussion: We have applied F-Motif to several new and existing data sets and compared its performance with two well known state-of-the-art methods. In almost all cases F-Motif could identify all statistically significant motifs extracted by the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, in addition to this, F-Motif uncovers several novel motifs. We have demonstrated using clues from the literature that most of these new motifs discovered by F-Motif are indeed novel. We have also found some interesting phenomena. For example, for CK2 kinase, the conserved sites appear only on the right side of S. However, for CDK kinase, the adjacent site on the right of S is conserved with residue P. In addition, three different encoding methods, including a novel position contrast matrix (PCM) and the simplest binary coding, are used and the ability of F-motif to discover motifs remains quite robust with respect to encoding schemes. Conclusions: An iterative algorithm proposed here uses exploratory data analysis to discover motifs from phosphorylated data. The effectiveness of F-Motif has been demonstrated using several real data sets as well as using a synthetic data set. The method is quite general in nature and can be used to find other types of motifs also. We have also provided a server for F-Motif at http://f-motif.classcloud.org/, http://bio.classcloud.org/f-motif/ or http://ymu.classcloud.org/f-motif/. © 2011 Chen et al.

A scale for measuring a CIO's effectiveness and management capability was developed and validated. A partial least squares method was used to test the conceptual model empirically and hypotheses were tested through data collected in a large-scale survey. The results supported the proposed framework, and confirmed our hypotheses that both IT and managerial competencies have positive significant impact on the effectiveness of a CIO. We also found that his or her IT management capability significantly impacted the CIO's performance. Our findings are likely to be of particular value to those concerned with IT management training and competency development for CIOs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

81055124083	Orange computing: Challenges and opportunities for affective signal processing	As the growth of economy and technology has become increasingly rapid, mental care is getting more important today. However, recent movements, such green technologies, place more emphasis on environmental issues but less on mental care. Therefore, this paper presents a newly emerging technology called orange computing for mental care applications. Orange computing refers to health, happiness, and physiopsychological care computing, which focuses on designing algorithms and systems for enhancing body and mind balance. The representative color for orange computing comes from a harmonic fusion of passion, love, and happiness. In order to demonstrate the main idea of orange computing, in this work we also discuss affective signal processing, one of the important topics in orange computing. Besides, a case study on the emotion speech recognition system for emotion care services is presented at the end of the paper. Experimental results show that the proposed system can enhance the accuracy rate by 4.44% on average. In contrast with the baselines, the proposed system can identify emotion speeches more precisely, subsequently demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the system. © 2011 IEEE.

83255187988	A pressure correction method for fluid-particle interaction flow: Direct-forcing method and sedimentation flow	A direct-forcing pressure correction method is developed to simulate fluid-particle interaction problems. In this paper, the sedimentation flow is investigated. This method uses a pressure correction method to solve incompressible flow fields. A direct-forcing method is introduced to capture the particle motions. It is found that the direct-forcing method can also be served as a wall-boundary condition. By applying Gauss's divergence theorem, the formulas for computing the hydrodynamic force and torque acting on the particle from flows are derived from the volume integral of the particle instead of the particle surface. The order of accuracy of the present method is demonstrated by the errors of velocity, pressure, and wall stress. To demonstrate the efficiency and capability of the present method, sedimentations of many spherical particles in an enclosure are simulated. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A volume fraction function is introduced in the VOF method and is governed by an advection equation. A modified monotone upwind scheme for a conservation law (modified MUSCL) is used to solve the solution of the advection equation. To keep the initial sharpness of an interface, a slope modification scheme is introduced. The continuum surface tension (CST) model is used to calculate the surface tension force.

Moreover, a height function technique is applied to compute the local curvature of the interface. Several basic test problems are performed to check the order of accuracy of the present numerical schemes for computing the interface normal vector and the gradient of the volume fraction function. Three physical problems, two-dimensional broken dam problem, static drop, and spurious currents, and three-dimensional rising bubble, are performed to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the pressure correction method. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84863182681	CEMiner - An efficient algorithm for mining closed patterns from time interval-based data	The mining of closed sequential patterns has attracted researchers for its capability of using compact results to preserve the same expressive power as conventional mining. However, existing studies only focus on time point-based data. Few research efforts have elaborated on discovering closed sequential patterns from time interval-based data, where each data persists for a period of time. Mining closed time intervalbased patterns, also called closed temporal patterns, is an arduous problem since the pairwise relationships between two interval-based events are intrinsically complex. In this paper, an efficient algorithm, CEMiner is developed to discover closed temporal patterns from interval-based data. Algorithm CEMiner employs some optimization techniques to effectively reduce the search space. The experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets indicate that CEMiner not only significantly outperforms the prior interval-based mining algorithms in terms of execution time but also possesses graceful scalability.

84864690491	An integrated mechanism for feature selection and fuzzy rule extraction for classification	In our view, the most important characteristic of a fuzzy rule-based system is its readability, which is seriously affected by, among other things, the number of features used to design the rule base. Hence, for high-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction through feature selection (not extraction) is very important. Our objective, here, is not to find an optimal rule base for classification but to select a set of useful features that may solve the classification problem. For this, we present an integrated mechanism for simultaneous extraction of fuzzy rules and selection of useful features. Since the feature selection method is integrated into the rule base formation, our scheme can account for possible subtle nonlinear interaction between features, as well as that between features and the tool, and, consequently, can select a set of useful features for the classification job. We have tried our method on several commonly used datasets as well as on a synthetic dataset with dimension varying from 4 to 60.

84864391011	Evaluation of subsurface damage and residual stress of glass ceramic under grinding process	The glass ceramic, ZERODUR®, has found broad applications such as mirror substrates and optomechanical structures, and is usually manufactured by grinding, lapping and polishing to achieve the final shape. As a brittle material, cracked layer (also called subsurface damage, SSD) or residual stresses are inevitable on the processed surface, which will reduce the mechanical strength as well as deteriorate the optical performance of the component. This research investigates the SSD and residual stress on ZERODUR® substrates after different grinding processes. Optical inspection, confocal microscopy and photoelasticity are utilized to analyze the SSD and residual stress on the surfaces. In addition, the surface finish (roughness) of the ZERODUR® surface under different grinding processes is also considered. The effects of different grinding parameters on the SSD and residual stress are evaluated, and the relationships among the grinding parameters, SSD and residual stress are discussed. The information of SSD and residual stress are essential for subsequent process such as polishing and acid etching.

84866866177	Social photo tagging recommendation using community-based group associations	In the social network, living photos occupy a large portion of web contents. For sharing a photo with the people appearing in that, users have to manually tag the people with their names, and the social network system links the photo to the people immediately. However, tagging the photos manually is a time-consuming task while people take thousands of photos in their daily life. Therefore, more and more researchers put their eyes on how to recommend tags for a photo. In this paper, our goal is to recommend tags for a query photo with one tagged face. We fuse the results of face recognition and the user's relationships obtained from social contexts. In addition, the Community-Based Group Associations, called CBGA, is proposed to discover the group associations among users through the community detection. Finally, the experimental evaluations show that the performance of photo tagging recommendation is improved by combining the face recognition and social relationship. Furthermore, the proposed framework achieves the high quality for social photo tagging recommendation. © 2012 IEEE.

84869012652	Efficient algorithms for influence maximization in social networks	In recent years, due to the surge in popularity of social-networking web sites, considerable interest has arisen regarding influence maximization in social networks. Given a social network structure, the problem of influence maximization is to determine a minimum set of nodes that could maximize the spread of influences. With a large-scale social network, the efficiency and practicability of such algorithms are critical. Although many recent studies have focused on the problem of influence maximization, these works in general are time-consuming when a social network is large-scale. In this paper, we propose two novel algorithms, CDH-Kcut and Community and Degree Heuristic on Kcut/SHRINK, to solve the influence maximization problem based on a realistic model. The algorithms utilize the community structure, which significantly decreases the number of candidates of influential nodes, to avoid information overlap. The experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets indicate that our algorithms not only significantly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in efficiency but also possess graceful scalability. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

The new polarization phase-shifting interferometric system is verified by using Jones matrices. A composite optics designed allows the two phase-shifted images to be captured by one CCD simultaneously. By taking two images before and two images after the deformation, the four images were adjusted to the same gray level, and the pixel position mismatch among the images was corrected by digital image correlation method. Thereafter, the phase at each pixel was calculated. Test of the system on a force exerted disk and a heated disk was demonstrated. The results reveal that the system is applicable for dynamic measurement. However, the phase map is too noisy for phase unwraping, and further study is required. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2013.

84872816191	Study of bonding positions of isostatic mounts on a lightweight primary mirror	The bonding positions of three isostatic mounts on the primary mirror of a Cassegrain telescope under self-weight loading have both been studied in the paper. Finite element method and Zernike polynomial fitting are complementarily applied to the ZERODUR® primary mirror with a pre-designed lightweight configuration on the back. Eight bonding positions of isostatic mounts with respect to the center of gravity of the mirror have been chosen to investigate the mirror surface deforms as well as the induced optical aberrations. It is found that astigmatism becomes remarkably higher than other optical aberrations under self-weight loading. The optimum bonding position with the least astigmatism value has also been obtained. © 2012 SPIE.

84873371629	An intelligent system for mining usage patterns from appliance data in smart home environment	In the last decade, considerable concern has arisen over the electricity saving due to the issue of reducing greenhouse gases. Previous studies on usage pattern utilization mainly are focused on power disaggregation and appliance recognition. Little attention has been paid to utilizing pattern mining for the target of energy saving. In this paper, we develop an intelligent system which analyzes appliance usage to extract users' behavior patterns in a smart home environment. With the proposed system, users can acquire the electricity consumption of each appliance for energy saving easily. In advance, if the electricity cost is high, users can observe the abnormal usage of appliances from the proposed system. Furthermore, we also apply our system on real-world dataset to show the practicability of mining usage pattern in smart home environment. © 2012 IEEE.

84873902448	Simulation of thermal-optical effects on a PMMA fresnel lens used in solar concentrators	This study presents an integrated opto-mechanical analysis of a PMMA Fresnel lens used in solar concentrators for concentrated photovoltaic systems. The temperature dependence of refractive index of the PMMA lens was analyzed based on its temperature coefficient of refractive index dn/dT. In addition, the thermal distortion of the Fresnel lens under various temperature rises was computed by finite element analysis (FEA). Then, the temperature induced effects, variation of refractive index and the deformed lens geometry, were imported into ray tracing simulation simultaneously. Finally, the thermal-optical effects on the optical performance of a flat Fresnel lens were successfully investigated and discussed, including the maximum irradiances on the receiver and the optical efficiencies under different temperature rises. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84880048001	Examining factors affecting college students' intention to use web-based instruction systems: Towards an integrated model	With accelerated progress of information and communication technologies (ICT), web-based instruction (WBI) is becoming a popular method for education resources distributing and delivering. This study was conducted to explore what factors influence college students' behavioral intentions to utilize WBI systems. To achieve this aim, a WBI system was developed and employed in a vocational college in Taiwan to support undergraduate courses learning. Drawing on the concepts from Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), this study proposes a nomological framework and develops an instrument for measuring college students' intention to use the WBI platform. The empirical results indicate that students show great readiness and positive intentions towards the system for their web-based learning activities and expose a possible benefit from its use in the long term. The research findings can provide instrumental suggestions for web-based instruction practices and may serve as instrumental guidelines for WBI systems to be effectively designed to advance college students' interests and activations in the virtual learning environment. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.

84881452483	Pressure correction method for simulating solid-fluid mixture flow	A pressure correction method is developed to simulate fluid-particle interaction flows. In this Paper, the three-dimensional solid-fluid mixture flows are investigated. The pressure corrected method coupled with the direct-forcing immersed boundary (IB) and the volume of fluid (VOF) methods is used to simulate the mixture flows. A discrete element method (DEM) together with a multi-time-step algorithm is introduced into the pressure correction method to calculate the forces and torques between solid bodies and between solid bodies and walls. As a demonstration of the efficient and capabilities of the present method, four test cases are simulated. They include sedimentation of one spherical particle in an enclosure, collapse of six solid-cylinder layers, two-dimensional solid-fluid mixture flow, and three-dimensional solid-fluid mixture flow.

84885613045	Near-duplicate video retrieval and localization using pattern set based dynamic programming	With the exponential growth of the web multimedia contents, illegal video copies are widespread and easy to be obtained from search engines and video sharing websites. For video copyright protection, near-duplicate video retrieval becomes more and more important. In this paper, we proposed a Pattern Set based Dynamic Programming (PSDP) algorithm to retrieve near-duplicate videos efficiently and effectively. In addition, the precise positions of the near-duplicate segments in videos can also be located. To better deal with the slow/fast motion and the dropped frame problem, the Time-shift Pattern set Similarity (TPS) is then applied. Two datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, and the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the compared approaches in terms of precision and execution time in both two datasets. © 2013 IEEE.

84893560474	99-110 Mining appliance usage patterns in smart home environment	Nowadays, due to the great advent of sensor technology, the data of all appliances in a house can be collected easily. However, with a huge amount of appliance usage log data, it is not an easy task for residents to visualize how the appliances are used. Mining algorithms is necessary to discover appliance usage patterns that capture representative usage behavior of appliances. If some of our representative patterns of appliance electricity usages are available, we may be able to adapt our usage behaviors to conserve the energy easily. In this paper, we introduce (i) two types of usage patterns which capture the representative usage behaviors of appliances in a smart home environment and (ii) the corresponding algorithms for discovering usage patterns efficiently. Finally, we apply our algorithms on a real-world dataset to show the practicability of usage pattern mining. © Springer-Verlag 2013.

84899737385	CIM: Community-based influence maximization in social networks	Given a social graph, the problem of influence maximization is to determine a set of nodes that maximizes the spread of influences. While some recent research has studied the problem of influence maximization, these works are generally too time consuming for practical use in a large-scale social network. In this article, we develop a new framework, community-based influence maximization (CIM), to tackle the influence maximization problem with an emphasis on the time efficiency issue. Our proposed framework, CIM, comprises three phases: (i) community detection, (ii) candidate generation, and (iii) seed selection. Specifically, phase (i) discovers the community structure of the network; phase (ii) uses the information of communities to narrow down the possible seed candidates; and phase (iii) finalizes the seed nodes from the candidate set. By exploiting the properties of the community structures, we are able to avoid overlapped information and thus efficiently select the number of seeds to maximize information spreads. The experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed CIM algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-The-art algorithms in terms of efficiency and scalability, with almost no compromise of effectiveness. © 2014 ACM.

84902583411	The impacts of presentation modes and product involvements on "line" short message service (SMS) advertising effectiveness	In today's ubiquitous commerce (UC) era, short message service (SMS) advertisement has played an important role in the world of marketing. Convenience and economical reasons influence SMS usage frequency along with social involvement to influence attitudes towards SMS advertising. SMS advertising creates numerous opportunities for the marketers in promoting their products effectively. Adopting the competition for attention theory as the theoretical framework, we developed hypotheses to investigate the influences of presentation mode and involvement on SMS advertising performance (recall of advertising information). An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of three types of information presentation modes (text-only, image-text, and emoji-text) in the contexts of two product types (high- versus low-involvement products) in the "LINE" SMS environment. Specifically, in this current study, we allocate participants to six experimental environments (text-only for high-involvement products, text-only for low-involvement products, image-text for high-involvement products, image-text for low-involvement products, emoji-text for high-involvement products and emoji-text for low-involvement products) randomly to collected empirical data to examine the proposed hypotheses. The research findings are expected to provide instrumental guidelines for the practitioners to better achieve the goals of ads in the "LINE" SMS environment. Also, the empirical results may provide insights into the research of advertising interface design of SMS and integrating efforts from cognitive science and vision research to understand users' involvement of SMS advertising processes.

84905833672	Complement arities between relational and contractual governances in e-health absorptive capacity	As healthcare organizations rely more heavily on IT, there is a growing need to understand innovative IT use in these organizations. First, this research introduces the concept of ehealth absorptive capacity which consists of e-health entrepreneurial alertness, assimilation and exploitation, based on Cohen and Levinthal (1990)'s absorptive capacity theory. We then address the theoretical neglected question of how and why the e-health entrepreneurial alertness influences e-health exploitation. Finally we use the theory of transaction cost economics to identify relational governance and contractual governance and theorize the relative impacts of the relational and contractual governances across e-health absorptive capacity processes. Based on data collected from the 182 senior management from104 healthcare organizations, we found 1) greater e-health entrepreneurial alertness enhanced ehealth exploitation in the e-health context by enhancing e-health assimilation, 2) relational and contractual governances each had a stronger impact on e-health absorptive capacity, 3) relational governance had a stronger impact on the early stage (i.e., e-health entrepreneurial alertness) of the absorptive capacity process than contractual governance and contractual governance has a greater impact on the later stage (i.e., e-health assimilation and e-health exploitation) than relational governance. Our findings provide insights on concern with ehealth capability development and managing e-health implementation.

84906236060	Determination of wafer center position during the transfer process by using the beam-breaking method	A wafer on a robot blade may slip due to inertia sliding during the acceleration or deceleration process. This study presents the implementation and experimental verification of a novel real-time wafer positioning system to be used during the transfer process. A system-integration computer program involving a human-machine interface (HMI) was also developed, exhibiting the following functions: (a) moving direction judgment; (b) notch-passing judgment; (c) indicating the sensor by which the notch passes; and (d) computing the wafer center in real time. The position of the wafer center is calculated based on the time-sequence of the beam-breaking signals from two optical sensors, and the geometric relations among the sensing points of the robot blade and wafer. When using eight-inch wafers, the experimental results indicated the capabilities of the proposed positioning system under various conditions, including distinct parameters regarding the moving direction, wafer displacement and notch-passing sensors. The accuracy and precision (repeatability) of the measurement in various conditions were calculated and discussed. Furthermore, the experimental results demonstrate that, after combining the novel wafer positioning system and HMI program, the proposed method can be used to compute the position of the wafer center in real time in various conditions. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.
