1842611666	Exploring binding energy and separation energy dependences of HBT strength	Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) results of the nucleon-nucleon correlation function have been presented for the nuclear reactions with neutron-rich projectiles (Be isotopes) using an event-generator, the Isospin-Dependent Quantum Molecular Dynamics model. We explore that the relationship between the binding energy per nucleon of the projectiles and the strength of the neutron-proton HBT at small relative momentum. Moreover, we reveal the relationship between the single neutron separation energy and the strength of the halo neutron-proton HBT. Results show that neutron-proton HBT results are sensitive to binding energy or separation energy. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1842763174	Influence of Central Collective Flow on Charged Particle Correlation Functions	Influence of the central collective flow on two-particle correlation function is discussed. The Monte-Carlo calculation is used to describe how the single particle and two-particle spectrum from a hot emission source are effected by the central collective flow. The two- proton correlation function for Ni + Ni system with b = 0fm at 100MeV / u is calculated by using QMD model. The particle interchange model is developed and used to prove the existence of a central collective flow in central sions of 100MeV / u Ni + Ni system. The results show that the two-particle correlation functions are indeed sensitive to the central collective flow. This might provide a method for studying the central collective flow formed in central collisions for medium heavy system at energies above 100MeV / u.

18544398857	Isospin influences on particle emission and critical phenomena in nuclear dissociation	Features of particle emission and critical point behavior are investigated as functions of the isospin of disassembling sources and temperature at a moderate freeze-out density for medium-size Xe isotopes in the framework of the isospin-dependent lattice gas model. Multiplicities of emitted light particles, isotopic, and isobaric ratios of light particles show the strong dependence on the isospin of the dissociation source, but double ratios of light isotope pairs and the critical temperature determined by the extreme values of some critical observables are insensitive to the isospin of the systems. Values of the power law parameter of cluster mass distribution, mean multiplicity of intermediate mass fragments (IMF), information entropy, and Campi's second moment also show a minor dependence on the isospin of Xe isotopes at the critical point.

21044449751	Experimental and theoretical challenges in the search for the quark-gluon plasma: The STAR Collaboration's critical assessment of the evidence from RHIC collisions	We review the most important experimental results from the first three years of nucleus-nucleus collision studies at RHIC, with emphasis on results from the STAR experiment, and we assess their interpretation and comparison to theory. The theory-experiment comparison suggests that central Au + Au collisions at RHIC produce dense, rapidly thermalizing matter characterized by: (1) initial energy densities above the critical values predicted by lattice QCD for establishment of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP); (2) nearly ideal fluid flow, marked by constituent interactions of very short mean free path, established most probably at a stage preceding hadron formation; and (3) opacity to jets. Many of the observations are consistent with models incorporating QGP formation in the early collision stages, and have not found ready explanation in a hadronic framework. However, the measurements themselves do not yet establish unequivocal evidence for a transition to this new form of matter. The theoretical treatment of the collision evolution, despite impressive successes, invokes a suite of distinct models, degrees of freedom and assumptions of as yet unknown quantitative consequence. We pose a set of important open questions, and suggest additional measurements, at least some of which should be addressed in order to establish a compelling basis to conclude definitively that thermalized, deconfined quark-gluon matter has been produced at RHIC. © 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

0000592090	RMF calculation and phenomenological formulas for the rms radii of light nuclei	The RMF (Relativistic Mean Field) calculations are performed systematically for light isotopes (A<40) with NL-SH parameter set. The calculated binding energies and root mean square (rms) radii of light nuclei are discussed. On the basis of the theoretical calculations and the experimental data, we have suggested a group of phenomenological formulas for the neutron, proton and matter rms radii for nuclei with A<40, including the drip-line nuclei. In these formulas, the effects of binding energies, isospin and separation energies are considered. These formulas not only agree to the experimental data for stable nuclei well, but also reproduce the abnormal large radii of nuclei near the drip-line that the previous empirical models fail to reproduce them.

0030526590	Disappearance of collective rotation in heavy ion collisions	A theoretical analysis of collective rotation is performed in heavy ion collisions below 100 MeV/nucleon in the quantum molecular dynamics approach. Both methods are contributed to this analysis, one is based on the shapes of azimuthal distribution, and the other is based on the numerical semiclassical calculation of rotation. The collective rotation becomes weaker with the increasing of beam energy, and tends to fade out at a certain beam energy. The impact parameter dependence of collective motion is also discussed. In connection with recent experiments, theoretical results and experimental data are compared by taking into account the fluctuation of experimental reaction plane determination.

The possibility of such GDR γ rays emission is described also according to the fission delay.

We find that the photon yield scales with the number of participating nucleons at all collision centralities studied. The pseudorapidity distribution of photons, dominated by π0 decays, has been compared to those of charged pions, photons, and inclusive charged particles from heavy-ion and nucleon-nucleon collisions at various energies.

We report measurements of K* in sNN=200GeV Au+Au and p+p collisions reconstructed via its hadronic decay channels K(892) *0→Kπ and K(892)*±→KS0π± using the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The K*0 mass has been studied as a function of pT in minimum bias p+p and central Au+Au collisions. The K*pT spectra for minimum bias p+p interactions and for Au+Au collisions in different centralities are presented. The K*/K yield ratios for all centralities in Au+Au collisions are found to be significantly lower than the ratio in minimum bias p+p collisions, indicating the importance of hadronic interactions between chemical and kinetic freeze-outs. A significant nonzero K*0 elliptic flow (v2) is observed in Au+Au collisions and is compared to the KS0 and Λ v2. The nuclear modification factor of K* at intermediate pT is similar to that of KS0 but different from Λ. This establishes a baryon-meson effect over a mass effect in the particle production at intermediate pT (2<pT≤4GeV/c). © 2005 The American Physical Society.

27144524094	Multistrange baryon elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	We report on the first measurement of elliptic flow ν2(pT) of multistrange baryons Ξ-+Ξ̄+ and Ω-+Ω̄+ in heavy-ion collisions. In minimum-bias Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV, a significant amount of elliptic flow, comparable to other nonstrange baryons, is observed for multistrange baryons which are expected to be particularly sensitive to the dynamics of the partonic stage of heavy-ion collisions. The pT dependence of ν2 of the multistrange baryons confirms the number of constituent quark scaling previously observed for lighter hadrons. These results support the idea that a substantial fraction of the observed collective motion is developed at the early partonic stage in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

We observe correlations decreasing with centrality that are similar at all four incident energies. The correlations multiplied by the multiplicity density increase with incident energy, and the centrality dependence may show evidence of processes such as thermalization, jet production, or the saturation of transverse flow. The square root of the correlations divided by the event-wise average transverse momentum per event shows little or no beam energy dependence and generally agrees with previous measurements made at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

The binding-energy dependence of the momentum correlation functions is also explored, and other factors that have an influence on momentum correlation functions are investigated. These factors include momentum-dependent nuclear equations of state, in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections, impact parameters, total pair momenta, and beam energy. In particular, the rise and the fall of the strength of momentum correlation functions at lower relative momentum are shown with an increase in beam energy. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

This talk discusses the application of coalescence model analyses to explore light particle emission in reactions between 47A MeV projectiles and medium mass targets.

33745549985	Minijet deformation and charge-independent angular correlations on momentum subspace (η,) in Au-Au collisions at sNN=130 GeV	Measurements of two-particle correlations on angular difference variables η1-η2 (pseudorapidity) and 1- 2 (azimuth) are presented for all primary charged hadrons with transverse momentum 0.15≤pt≤2 GeV/c and |η|≤1.3 from Au-Au collisions at sNN=130 GeV. Large-amplitude correlations are observed over a broad range in relative angles where distinct structures appear on the same-side and away-side (i.e., relative azimuth less than π/2 or greater than π/2). The principal correlation structures include that associated with elliptic flow plus a strong, same-side peak. It is hypothesized that the latter results from correlated hadrons associated with semi-hard parton scattering in the early stage of the heavy-ion collision which produces a jet-like correlation peak at small relative angles. The width of the jet-like peak on η1-η2 increases by a factor 2.3 from peripheral to central collisions, suggesting strong coupling of semi-hard scattered partons to a longitudinally-expanding medium. The new methods of jet analysis introduced here provide access to scattered partons at low transverse momentum well below the kinematic range where perturbative quantum chromodynamics and standard fragmentation models are applicable. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

It looks that the evaporation has stronger effect on α than β. For cold fragments, a monotonic increase of α and |β| with the increase of Z and N is observed.

By analyzing the multiplicity dependence we find that the spectrum shape can be decomposed into a part with amplitude proportional to multiplicity and described by a Lévy distribution on transverse mass mt, and a part with amplitude proportional to multiplicity squared and described by a Gaussian distribution on transverse rapidity yt. The functional forms of the two parts are nearly independent of event multiplicity. The two parts can be identified with the soft and hard components of a two-component model of p-p collisions. This analysis then provides the first isolation of the hard component of the pt spectrum as a distribution of simple form on yt. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The p+p yield generally agrees with next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations. The d+Au yield per binary collision is suppressed as Î• increases, decreasing to â 30% of the p+p yield at = 4.00, well below shadowing expectations. Exploratory measurements of azimuthal correlations of the forward Ï€0 with charged hadrons at 0 show a recoil peak in p+p that is suppressed in d+Au at low pion energy.

In central Au+Au collisions, both and p(p) show significant suppression with respect to binary scaling at pT 4 GeV/c. Protons and antiprotons are less suppressed than ±, in the range 1.5a pT 6 GeV/c. The -/I + and p/p ratios show at most a weak pT dependence and no significant centrality dependence. The p/Ï€ ratios in central Au+Au collisions approach the values in p+p and d+Au collisions at pT 5 GeV/c.

The proton and lambda source size is inferred from the p-Λ and p̄-Λ̄ correlation functions. It is found to be smaller than the pion source size also measured by the STAR experiment at smaller transverse masses, in agreement with a scenario of a strong universal collective flow. The p-Λ̄ and p̄-Λ correlation functions, which are measured for the first time, exhibit a large anticorrelation. Annihilation channels and/or a negative real part of the spin-averaged scattering length must be included in the final-state interactions calculation to reproduce the measured correlation function. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33751585515	Elliptic flow of mesons and strange quark collectivity	Based on a multiphase transport model, we have studied the elliptic flow v2 of mesons from the reconstructed K+K- decay channel at the top Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider energy at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The dependences of v2 on transverse momentum pT and collision centrality are presented and the rescattering effect of mesons in the hadronic phase is also investigated. The results show that experimental measurement of v2 for mesons can retain the early collision information before the decays and that the v2 value obeys the constituent quark number scaling that has been observed for other mesons and baryons. Our study indicates that the v2 mostly reflects partonic-level collectivity developed during the early stage of the nucleus-nucleus collision and the strange and light up/down quarks have developed similar angular anistropy properties at the hadronization. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

At the mean transverse mass mT =1.07 GeV, we obtain the values R=4.09±0.46(stat)±0.31(sys) fm and λ=0.92±0.23(stat) ±0.13(sys), where R and λ are the invariant radius and chaoticity parameters, respectively.

The analysis involves unlike-sign charged pairs and like-sign charged pairs, which are transformed into charge-dependent (CD) signals and charge-independent (CI) signals. We present detailed parametrizations of the data. A model featuring dense gluonic hot spots as first proposed by Van Hove predicts that the observables under investigation would have sensitivity to such a substructure should it occur, and the model also motivates selection of transverse momenta in the range 0.8<pt<2.0 GeV/c.

The yield of multistrange baryons per participant nucleon increases from peripheral to central collisions more rapidly than that of Λ, indicating an increase of the strange-quark density of the matter produced. The strange phase-space occupancy factor γs approaches unity for the most central collisions. Moreover, the nuclear modification factors of p, Λ, and Ξ are consistent with each other for 2<pT<5GeV/c in agreement with a scenario of hadron formation from constituent quark degrees of freedom. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The nonphotonic electron yield exhibits an unexpectedly large suppression in central Au+Au collisions at high pT, suggesting substantial heavy-quark energy loss at RHIC.

We find that the previously observed universal transverse mass (mT pT2+m2) scaling of hadron production in p+p collisions seems to break down at higher mT and that there is a difference in the shape of the mT spectrum between baryons and mesons. We observe midrapidity antibaryon to baryon ratios near unity for Λ and Ξ baryons and no dependence of the ratio on transverse momentum, indicating that our data do not yet reach the quark-jet dominated region. We show the dependence of the mean transverse momentum pT on measured charged particle multiplicity and on particle mass and infer that these trends are consistent with gluon-jet dominated particle production. The data are compared with previous measurements made at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron and Intersecting Storage Rings and in Fermilab experiments and with leading-order and next-to-leading-order string fragmentation model predictions. We infer from these comparisons that the spectral shapes and particle yields from p+p collisions at RHIC energies have large contributions from gluon jets rather than from quark jets. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The v2(pT) values for all hadron species at 62.4 GeV are similar to those observed in 130 and 200 GeV collisions. For observed kinematic ranges, v2 values at 62.4, 130, and 200 GeV are as little as 10-15% larger than those in Pb+Pb collisions at sNN=17.3 GeV. At intermediate transverse momentum (pT from 1.5-5 GeV/c), the 62.4 GeV v2(pT) and v4(pT) values are consistent with the quark-number scaling first observed at 200 GeV. A four-particle cumulant analysis is used to assess the nonflow contributions to pions and protons and some indications are found for a smaller nonflow contribution to protons than pions. Baryon v2 is larger than antibaryon v2 at 62.4 and 200 GeV, perhaps indicating either that the initial spatial net-baryon distribution is anisotropic, that the mechanism leading to transport of baryon number from beam- to midrapidity enhances v2 or that antibaryon and baryon annihilation is larger in the in-plane direction. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We present the results of Λ and Λ̄ hyperon global polarization measurements in Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 and 200 GeV performed with the STAR detector at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC).

34547408483	Transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependences of Mach-like correlations for central Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	The transverse-momentum and pseudorapidity dependences of partonic Machlike shock wave have been studied by using a multiphase transport model with both partonic and hadronic interactions. The splitting parameter D, i.e., half distance between two splitting peaks on away side in di-hadron azimuthal angular (Δ) correlations, slightly increases with the transverse momentum of associated hadrons (pTassoc), which is consistent with preliminary experimental trend, owing to different interaction-lengths/numbers between wave partons and medium in strong parton cascade. However, the splitting parameter D as a function of pseudorapidity of associated hadrons (ηassoc), stays flat in the mid-pseudorapidity region and rapidly drops in the high-pseudorapidity region, which is a result of different violent degrees of jet-medium interactions in the medium that has different energy densities in the longitudinal direction. It is proposed that the research on the properties of Machlike correlation can shed light on the knowledge of both partonic and hadronic interactions at RHIC. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The Al23,24 ions were produced through projectile fragmentation of 135A MeV Si28 primary beam using the RIPS fragment separator at RIKEN. P// is measured by a direct time-of-flight (TOF) technique, while σR is determined using a transmission method. An enhancement in σR is observed for Al23 compared with Al24.

Results show that α and β neither depends on light fragment size nor on source size.

In minimum bias collisions the v2 of the Ï• meson is consistent with the trend observed for mesons. The ratio of the yields of the Î© to those of the Ï• as a function of transverse momentum is consistent with a model based on the recombination of thermal s quarks up to pT 4GeV/c, but disagrees at higher momenta. The nuclear modification factor (RCP) of Ï• follows the trend observed in the KS0 mesons rather than in baryons, supporting baryon-meson scaling.

34948864310	Measurement of transverse single-spin asymmetries for dijet production in proton-proton collisions at s=200GeV	We report the first measurement of the opening angle distribution between pairs of jets produced in high-energy collisions of transversely polarized protons. The measurement probes (Sivers) correlations between the transverse spin orientation of a proton and the transverse momentum directions of its partons. With both beams polarized, the wide pseudorapidity (-1≤η≤+2) coverage for jets permits separation of Sivers functions for the valence and sea regions. The resulting asymmetries are all consistent with zero and considerably smaller than Sivers effects observed in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. We discuss theoretical attempts to reconcile the new results with the sizable transverse spin effects seen in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and forward hadron production in pp collisions. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

35948984150	Rapidity and species dependence of particle production at large transverse momentum for d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	We determine rapidity asymmetry in the production of charged pions, protons, and antiprotons for large transverse momentum (pT) for d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The rapidity asymmetry is defined as the ratio of particle yields at backward rapidity (Au beam direction) to those at forward rapidity (d beam direction). The identified hadrons are measured in the rapidity regions |y|<0.5 and 0.5<|y|<1.0 for the pT range 2.5<pT<10GeV/c. We observe significant rapidity asymmetry for charged pion and proton+antiproton production in both the rapidity regions. The asymmetry is larger for 0.5<|y|<1.0 than for |y|<0.5 and is almost independent of particle type. The measurements are compared to various model predictions employing multiple scattering, energy loss, nuclear shadowing, saturation effects, and recombination and also to a phenomenological parton model. We find that asymmetries are sensitive to model parameters and show model preference. The rapidity dependence of π-/π+ and p̄/p ratios in peripheral d+Au and forward neutron-tagged events are used to study the contributions of valence quarks and gluons to particle production at high pT. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

37549010623	Forward Λ production and nuclear stopping power in d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	We report the measurement of Λ and Λ̄ yields and inverse slope parameters in d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV at forward and backward rapidities (y=±2.75), using data from the STAR forward time projection chambers. The contributions of different processes to baryon transport and particle production are probed exploiting the inherent asymmetry of the d+Au system. Comparisons to model calculations show that baryon transport on the deuteron side is consistent with multiple collisions of the deuteron nucleons with gold participants. On the gold side, HIJING-based models without a hadronic rescattering phase do not describe the measured particle yields, while models that include target remnants or hadronic rescattering do. The multichain model can provide a good description of the net baryon density in d+Au collisions at energies currently available at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and the derived parameters of the model agree with those from nuclear collisions at lower energies. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

4043112872	Ground state properties of odd-Z superheavy nuclei	The ground state properties of odd-Z superheavy nuclei in the mass range of Z = 97-115 and N = 140-190 are systematically investigated in deformed relativistic mean-field (RMF) theory. Special emphasis is placed on nuclear shell effect around N = 184. Calculations clearly show that the RMF model can reliably reproduce the data of binding energy and α decay energy of known nuclei and can also be used to predict the binding energy of unknown nuclei. It is found that deformation plays an important role for many superheavy nuclei. For N = 184 isotones, the lighter ones are approximately spherical but the heavier ones are deformed. The α-decay energies of N = 184 isotones are lower than those of neighboring nuclei in some cases and higher in other cases. This demonstrates that there is a complicated structural behavior for N = 184 isotones.

The masses of two fission fragments are given by assuming the process of symmetric fission or asymmetric fission by Monte Carlo sampling with the Gaussian probability distribution. From the analysis of the isotopic/isotonic ratios of the fission fragments from both reactions, the isoscaling behavior has been observed and investigated in detail. Isoscaling parameters α and β are extracted as a function of the charge number and neutron number, respectively, in different widths of the sampling Gaussian probability distribution. It seems that α is sensitive to the width of fission probability distribution of the mass asymmetrical parameter, but β is not. Both α and β drop with increasing beam energy and reduced friction parameter. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

33644894160	Multiplicity and pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles and photons at forward pseudorapidity in Au+Au collisons at sNN=62.4 GeV	We present the centrality-dependent measurement of multiplicity and pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles and photons in Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 GeV. The charged particles and photons are measured in the pseudorapidity region 2.9≤η≤3.9 and 2.3≤η≤3.7, respectively. We have studied the scaling of particle production with the number of participating nucleons and the number of binary collisions. The photon and charged particle production in the measured pseudorapidity range has been shown to be consistent with energy-independent limiting fragmentation behavior. Photons are observed to follow a centrality-independent limiting fragmentation behavior, while for charged particles it is centrality dependent. We have carried out a comparative study of the pseudorapidity distributions of positively charged hadrons, negatively charged hadrons, photons, pions, and net protons in nucleus-nucleus collisions and pseudorapidity distributions from p+p collisions. From these comparisons, we conclude that baryons in the inclusive charged particle distribution are responsible for the observed centrality dependence of limiting fragmentation. The mesons are found to follow an energy-independent behavior of limiting fragmentation, whereas the behavior of baryons is energy dependent. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Preparing sample is the key process for SPM imaging. Detecting nanoparticles with SPM often faces the problem that the nanoparticles are usually repolymerized by the molecular force and form nanoparticle-reunions in the process of preparing SPM specimens. To conquer this difficulty, we propose a new method for preparing SPM nanoparticle specimens by soft microprinting combined with enhanced diffusing, in which proper nanoparticle dispersal system can be formed on the substrate surface separated in the liquor nano-film after soft-lithographed. Experiments validated that it is an available artifice for preparing nanoparticle sample in SPM detecting.

68549140183	Viscosity and dilepton production of a chemically equilibrating quark-gluon plasma at finite baryon density	By considering the effect of shear viscosity we have investigated the evolution of a chemically equilibrating quark-gluon plasma at finite baryon density. Based on the evolution of the system we have performed a complete calculation for the dilepton production from the following processes: qq̄→ll̄, qq̄→gll̄, Compton-like scattering (qg→qll̄,q̄g→q̄ll̄), gluon fusion (gḡ→cc̄), annihilation (qq̄→cc̄), as well as the multiple scattering of quarks. We have found that quark-antiquark annihilation, Compton-like scatterring, gluon fusion, and multiple scattering of quarks give important contributions. Moreover, we have also found that the dilepton yield is an increasing function of the initial quark chemical potential, and the increase of the quark phase lifetime because of the viscosity also obviously raises the dilepton yield. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

It was found that the droplet model reproduced the ΔRMS of normal nuclei well, but it underestimates the ΔRMS for neutron skin and neutron halo nuclei. Since the small separation energy of last one or two neutron is one of the most important causes of the appearance of anomalous nuclear structure, an effective neutron skin thickness was used to distinguish nuclei with anomalous neutron distribution from normal nuclei, which succeeds to reproduce the abnormal increase of the neutron skin thickness for the light nuclei with neutron skin or neutron halo.

Here we present the correlator previously used split into its two component parts to reveal correlations parallel and perpendicular to the event plane. The results are from a high-statistics 200-GeV Au + Au collisions data set (57×106 events) collected by the STAR experiment. We explicitly count units of charge separation from which we find clear evidence for more charge-separation fluctuations perpendicular than parallel to the event plane. We also employ a modified correlator to study the possible P-even background in same- and opposite-charge correlations, and find that the P-even background may largely be explained by momentum conservation and collective motion. © 2013 American Physical Society.

Neutral pions were detected using the end cap electromagnetic calorimeter in the STAR detector at RHIC. The cross section was measured over a transverse momentum range of 5<pT<16 GeV/c and is found to agree with a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculation. The longitudinal double-spin asymmetry ALL is measured in the same pseudorapidity range and spans a range of Bjorken-x down to x≈0.01. The measured ALL is consistent with model predictions for varying degrees of gluon polarization. The parity-violating asymmetry AL is also measured and found to be consistent with zero. The transverse single-spin asymmetry AN is measured over a previously unexplored kinematic range in Feynman-x and pT. Such measurements may aid our understanding of the onset and kinematic dependence of the large asymmetries observed at more forward pseudorapidity (η≈3) and their underlying mechanisms.

The measurements are carried out by the STAR experiment at midrapidity (|y|<0.5) and within the transverse momentum range 0.4<pT<0.8 GeV/c in the first phase of the Beam Energy Scan program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. These measurements are important for understanding the quantum chromodynamic phase diagram. The products of the moments, Sσ and κσ2, are sensitive to the correlation length of the hot and dense medium created in the collisions and are related to the ratios of baryon number susceptibilities of corresponding orders. The products of moments are found to have values significantly below the Skellam expectation and close to expectations based on independent proton and antiproton production.

The trigger jet population in Au+Au collisions is biased toward jets that have not interacted with the medium, allowing easier matching of jet energies between Au+Au and p+p collisions while enhancing medium effects on the recoil jet. The associated hadron yield of the recoil jet is significantly suppressed at high transverse momentum (pTassoc) and enhanced at low pTassoc in 0%-20% central Au+Au collisions compared to p+p collisions, which is indicative of medium-induced parton energy loss in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84902477876	Origin of Gibrat law in Internet: Asymmetric distribution of the correlation	Although Gibrat's law and its generalized versions have been widely used, the organizing principle behind its phenomenological theory has been poorly studied for network-structured systems. More important, its fluctuation behavior, which contradicts the prediction of the preferential attachment (PA), indicates a nontrivial mechanism that goes beyond our present knowledge based on the traditional mean-field approach. Here, we take advantage of the rich data of the Internet and aim to identify the origin of Gibrat's law by studying the empirical fluctuation behavior. We show how the correlation between the fluctuations of the node degree increment affects the dynamics of the network. Specifically, if the distribution of the correlation is symmetric, the network evolves as the classical PA, while if such symmetry breaks, the fluctuation becomes macroscopically positively correlated and contributes to the emergence of Gibrat's law. These results indicate a local collective increase in the actual network evolution, which provides a new paradigm and understanding of the related microcosmic dynamics. © 2014 American Physical Society.

The measurements are evaluated in different invariant mass regions with a focus on 0.30-0.76 (ρ-like), 0.76-0.80 (ω-like), and 0.98-1.05 (φ-like) GeV/c2. The spectrum in the ω-like and φ-like regions can be well described by the hadronic cocktail simulation. In the ρ-like region, however, the vacuum ρ spectral function cannot describe the shape of the dielectron excess. In this range, an enhancement of 1.77±0.11(stat)±0.24(syst)±0. 33(cocktail) is determined with respect to the hadronic cocktail simulation that excludes the ρ meson. The excess yield in the ρ-like region increases with the number of collision participants faster than the ω and φ yields. Theoretical models with broadened ρ contributions through interactions with constituents in the hot QCD medium provide a consistent description of the dilepton mass spectra for the measurement presented here and the earlier data at the Super Proton Synchrotron energies. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84905575386	Beam-energy dependence of charge separation along the magnetic field in Au+Au collisions at RHIC	Local parity-odd domains are theorized to form inside a quark-gluon plasma which has been produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The local parity-odd domains manifest themselves as charge separation along the magnetic field axis via the chiral magnetic effect. The experimental observation of charge separation has previously been reported for heavy-ion collisions at the top RHIC energies. In this Letter, we present the results of the beam-energy dependence of the charge correlations in Au+Au collisions at midrapidity for center-of-mass energies of 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, and 62.4 GeV from the STAR experiment. After background subtraction, the signal gradually reduces with decreased beam energy and tends to vanish by 7.7 GeV.

The moments are related to the thermodynamic susceptibilities of net charge, and are sensitive to the location of the QCD critical point. We compare the products of the moments, 2/M, S, and κ2, with the expectations from Poisson and negative binomial distributions (NBDs). The S values deviate from the Poisson baseline and are close to the NBD baseline, while the κ2 values tend to lie between the two. Within the present uncertainties, our data do not show nonmonotonic behavior as a function of collision energy.

A significant suppression of pT-integrated J/ψ production is observed in central Au+Au events. The Cu+Cu data are consistent with no suppression, although the precision is limited by the available statistics. RAA in Au+Au collisions exhibits a strong suppression at low transverse momentum and gradually increases with pT. The data are compared to high-pT STAR results and previously published BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider results.

The flows calculated by the participant plane reconstructed by the initial geometry in coordinate space are compared with those calculated by both the ideal reaction-plane and event-plane methods. It is found that initial fluctuation weakens the squeeze-out effect, and some discrepancies between the flows extracted by these different plane methods appear, which indicate that the flows are affected by the evolution of dynamics. In addition, we find that the squeeze-out flow is also proportional to initial eccentricity. Our calculations also qualitatively give a trend for the excitation function of the elliptic flow similar to that of the FOPI Collaboration experimental data. Finally, we address the nucleon number scaling of the flows for light particles. Even though the initial fluctuation significantly decreases the ratio v4/v22 and v3/(v1v2), all fragments to mass number 4 keep the same curve and show independence from transverse momentum.

The elliptic flow is calculated at balance energies to exclude the geometric influence such as the blocking effect from the spectators. Our study shows that v2/b decreases almost linearly with increasing η, consistent with that observed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. On the other hand, v2/b is found to increase with increasing η/s.

84919706481	Dielectron azimuthal anisotropy at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at sNN =200 GeV	We report on the first measurement of the azimuthal anisotropy (v2) of dielectrons (e+e- pairs) at mid-rapidity from sNN=200 GeV Au+Au collisions with the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), presented as a function of transverse momentum (pT) for different invariant-mass regions. In the mass region Mee<1.1 GeV/c2 the dielectron v2 measurements are found to be consistent with expectations from π0,η,ω, and φ decay contributions. In the mass region 1.1<Mee<2.9GeV/c2, the measured dielectron v2 is consistent, within experimental uncertainties, with that from the cc¯ contributions.

1042302470	Statistical nature of cluster emission in nuclear liquid-vapour phase coexistence	The emission of nuclear clusters is investigated within the framework of the isospin-dependent lattice gas model and the classical molecular dynamics model. It is found that the emission of an individual cluster which is heavier than proton is almost Poissonian except near the transition temperature at which the system is leaving the liquid-vapour phase coexistence and thermal scaling is observed by the linear Arrhenius plots which are made from the average multiplicity of each cluster versus the inverse of temperature in the liquid-vapour phase coexistence. The slopes of the Arrhenius plots, i.e. the 'emission barriers', are extracted as a function of the mass or charge number and fitted by the formula embodied with the contributions of the surface energy and Coulomb interaction. Good agreements are obtained in comparison with the data for low-energy conditional barriers. In addition, the possible influences of the source size, Coulomb interaction and 'freeze-out' density and related physical implications are discussed.

11144279176	Shell effect of superheavy nuclei in self-consistent mean-field models	We analyze in detail the numerical results ofsuperheavy nuclei in deformed relativistic mean-field model and deformed Skyrme-Hartree-Fock model. The common points and differences of both models are systematically compared and discussed. Their consequences on the stability of superheavy nuclei are explored and explained. The theoretical results are compared with new data of superheavy nuclei from GSI and from Dubna and reasonable agreement is reached. Nuclear shell effect in superheavy region is analyzed and discussed. The spherical shell effect disappears in some cases due to the appearance of deformation or superdeformation in the ground states of nuclei, where valen ce nucleons occupy significantly the intruder levels of nuclei. It is shown for the first time that the significant occupation of valence nucleons on the intruder states plays an important role for the ground state properties of superheavy nuclei. Nuclei are stable in the deformed or superdeformed configurations. We further point out that one cannot obtain the octupole deformation of even-even nuclei in the present relativistic mean-field model with the σ, ω and ρ mesons because there is no parityviolating interaction and the conservation of parity of even-even nuclei is a basic assumption of the present relativistic mean-field model.

0347644606	Compton back-scattering γ-ray source based on synchrotron radiation facility (I) numerical calculation of the produced MeV γ-ray	We propose a build to low-energy γ-ray beam line (SLEGS-I) at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). By Compton back-scattering (BCS) of infrared or far-infrared laser lights from 3.5 GeV electrons circulating in the storage ring of SSRF, high intense quasi- monochromatic BCS γ-rays with high linear or circular polarization ranging 1-25MeV will be produced. It can be widely applied to fundamental researching fields of nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics and related applications. In this paper, we briefly present the outline of BCS theory and the properties of BCS γ-ray with numerical compution based on the major parameters of SSRF storage ring.

84921962827	Measurement of longitudinal spin asymmetries for weak boson production in polarized proton-proton collisions at RHIC	We report measurements of single- and double-spin asymmetries for W± and Z/γ* boson production in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at s=510GeV by the STAR experiment at RHIC. The asymmetries for W± were measured as a function of the decay lepton pseudorapidity, which provides a theoretically clean probe of the proton's polarized quark distributions at the scale of the W mass. The results are compared to theoretical predictions, constrained by polarized deep inelastic scattering measurements, and show a preference for a sizable, positive up antiquark polarization in the range 0.05<x<0.2. © 2014 American Physical Society.
