17044388241	Characterization of gan schottky barrier photodiodes with a low-temperature GaN Cap layer	By using organometallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE), we have prepared i-GaN/low-temperature (LT) GaN/Ni/Au (sample A) and i-GaN/Ni/Au (sample B) Schottky barrier ultraviolet (UV) photodiodes (PDs). It was found that we could significantly reduce leakage current and achieve a much larger photocurrent to dark current contrast ratio by introducing a LT GaN on top of the conventional nitride-based UV PDs. With incident light wavelength of 350 nm and a -1 V reverse bias, it was found that the measured responsivity was around 0.1 A/W and 0.37 A/W for sample A and sample B, respectively. Furthermore, it was found that the operation speed of sample A is slower than that of sample B due to the highly resistive LT-GaN layer induced large RC time constant.

18644380689	Effect of low-temperature-grown GaN cap layer on reduced leakage current of GaN Schottky diodes	In this study, GaN Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) were grown by organometallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE). It was found that we could significantly reduce reverse-bias leakage current by introducing a low-temperature-grown (LTG) GaN layer on top of the conventional GaN SBDs. The reduction has a factor of 3-4 in a typical GaNNiAu SBD having LTG GaN cap layer. Atomic force microscopy showed that surface pits of threading dislocation (TD) termination did not almost observed as the LTG GaN cap layer was grown to be disposed on a typical high-temperature (HT) GaN layer. Therefore, this reduction in leakage current could be related to the reduction of surface pit densities of threading dislocation termination by using LTG GaN cap layers. This might be due to the suppression of surface states existing in the vicinity of TD terminations. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.

Introducing the LT GaN on top of the conventional structures markedly reduced the leakage current and increased the barrier height. The measured barrier heights of the LT GaN-caped samples and the conventional samples were around 1 and 0.55 eV, respectively.

23744473753	Aluminum gallium nitride ultraviolet photodiodes with buried p-layer structure	An Al0.21 Ga0.79 NGaN p-i-n photodiode was designed with a heavily doped buried p+ -GaN layer associating an n++ - In0.3 Ga0.7 N layer to form a p+ n++ tunneling junction under the Al0.21 Ga0.79 p-i-n heterostructure. In contrast to conventional AlGaN-based p-i-n photodiodes, the inverted devices can have a low-resistivity n -type AlGaN top contact layer with a typical zero-bias peak responsivity of 0.1 AW at 315 nm corresponding to a quantum efficiency of around 39%. The zero-bias rejection ratio was about four orders of magnitude over the ultraviolet and visible regions of the spectrum. The typical dark current of the inverted devices was below 30 pA at a reverse bias of below 1.5 V. The leakage current at a 10 V reverse bias was as high as 5 nA caused by the presence of cracks in the Al0.21 Ga0.79 layers. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.

26244456541	Comparison of low-temperature GaN, SiO 2, and SiN x as gate insulators on AlGaNGaN heterostructure field-effect transistors	The performance of AlGaNGaN heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs) with either uncapped surfaces or with low-temperature (LT) GaN or Si O2 or Si Nx as gate insulators is reported. The sheet carrier concentrations of AlGaNGaN HFETs with any of these surface insulating layers are similar to each other and in each case about 50% higher than that in an AlGaNGaN HFET with a free surface. This result is consistent with the insulator layers providing passivation of surface states that cause the depletion of the channel layer. Due to the closer lattice match with the AlGaN surface layer, the HFET with a LT-GaN layer as the gate insulator shows the best dc and rf device performance, demonstrating that this material is an effective insulator for nitride electronic devices. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.

In this study, a growth-interruption step and an Mg-treatment process were simultaneously performed to create multiple truncated micropyramids on LED surface. Experimental results indicated that GaN-based LEDs with the truncated micropyramids on the top surface demonstrate improved external efficiency of around 60% at 20 mA.

33744475626	High efficiency and improved ESD characteristics of GaN-based LEDs with naturally textured surface grown by MOCVD	The following paper presents a study on GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with naturally textured surface grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The study utilizes a well-known approach of increasing light extraction efficiency. The approach is based on naturally formed V-shaped pits on surface that originate from low-temperature-growth (LTG) conditions of topmost p-GaN contact layer. In our experiment, the high-temperature-grown (HTG) p-GaN layer was inserted between the p-AlGaN electron-blocking layer and the LTG p-GaN contact layer, in order to suppress pit-related threading dislocations (TDs). These TDs may intersect the underlying active layer. The results of the experiment show that GaN-based LEDs with the HTG p-GaN insertion layer can effectively endure negative electrostatic discharge voltage of up to 7000 V. We also noted that application of 20-mA current injection yields output power of about 16 mW for the LEDs emitting around 465 nm. The output power results correspond to an external quantum efficiency of around 30%. © 2006 IEEE.

The Hall measurement and the x-ray diffraction pattern are measured to study the n-ZnO films. The temperature sensitivity coefficients of the I-V characterizations are obtained by different substrate temperatures (25, 50, 100, and 150 °C) and the extracted values are 2.10, 1.93, 3.22, and 1.36 mV/ °C in the forward bias and 8.7, 8.0, 4.6, and 2.3 mV/°C in the reverse bias, respectively.

34547350951	Enhanced efficiency of GaN-based light-emitting diodes with periodic textured Ga-doped ZnO transparent contact layer	GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with indium tin oxide (ITO)/Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) composite oxide films serving as a transparent contact layer (TCL) were demonstrated. In this study, the wall-plug efficiency of LEDs (LED-III) with textured ITO/GZO composite TCL can be markedly improved by 200% and 45% of magnitude as compared to conventional LEDs with NiAu TCL(LED-II) and planar ITO/GZO TCL(LED-I), respectively. Compared to LED-II, this enhancement is due to the enhanced light extraction efficiency of ITO/GZO composite TCL with high transparency. Compared to LED-I, ZnO-based TCL with a higher refractive index (n∼2.0) allows further enhancement of light extraction through the creation of a textured structure on transparent conductive oxide TCL deposited on the top surface of LEDs. In addition, the ITO/GZO composite TCL with a thickness of 550 nm is far larger than that of NiAu TCL with a thickness of approximately 15 nm. Therefore, in addition to the effect of high transparency, the thicker ITO/GZO TCL with low lateral resistance would also act as a current-spreading layer leading to an enhancement of light extraction. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

It was also found that the responsivity of the photodiode with LT-GaN interlayer can be enhanced at a small electric field (∼0.4 MVcm) due to the carrier multiplication effect. The UV photocurrent gain of 13 and large ionization coefficient (α=3.1× 105 cm-1) were also observed in the detector with LT-GaN interlayer.

It was found that the surface morphology and V-shaped pits were determined by growth temperature. Two different types of pit were observed namely, minute pits and open V-shape pits, in scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. The density of minute pits of AlGaN/GaN SLS decreased with increasing growth temperature. It was also found that the groovelike and striplike shapes of the surface morphology of the samples prepared at 800°C revealed a preferred orientation at about 30° angle to the flat side of the substrate, but this preferred orientation was disrupted at a higher growth temperature. The samples prepared at 850 and 900°C exhibited a higher PL intensity with a peak wavelength of about 363 nm because of the improvement in the crystal quality of AlGaN/GaN SLS. © 2008 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.

The water-splitting system was tuned using different approaches to set the operating points to the maximum power point of the GaAs solar cell. The approaches included changing the electrolytes, varying the light intensity, and introducing the immersed ITO ohmic contacts on the working electrodes.

Using this method, it was found that we could achieve InGaN "well layers" with high crystal quality due to the enhanced migration of adatoms during the growth. It was also found that indium composition in the InGaN "well layers" and the thickness of the InGaN "well layers" both depend strongly on the growth time of InN and GaN. It was also found that we could achieve stronger electroluminescence (EL) intensities with narrower full-width-half-maxima (FWHMs) from the LEDs with InN/GaN alternative growth InGaN "well layers".

42349103578	Excess carrier dynamics of InGaNGaN multiple-quantum-well light-emitting diodes with various silicon barrier doping profiles	This study investigates the carrier dynamics of InGaNGaN light-emitting diodes with various doping profiles in the active region by using time-resolved photoluminescence experiments. Excess carrier lifetime strongly depends on excitation intensity when the quantum wells in the active region comprise doped and undoped barriers. The measured lifetime is shorter when the excitation intensity is lower. Competition between radiative recombination in quantum wells with undoped barriers and carrier tunneling from quantum wells with undoped barriers to wells with doped barriers is responsible for this phenomenon. Reducing the excitation intensity causes more carriers to undergo faster recombination in doped quantum wells. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

The full-width at half-maximum of the AlInN peak measured by double crystal X-ray diffraction was 219.8 arcsec for the indium content of 20.8%. The effects of AlInN cladding layers on InGaN-GaN multiple-quantum-well light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were also investigated. From the room-temperature photoluminescence spectra, the shorter emission wavelength and the higher intensity were observed after employing AlInN cladding layers. Compared to the conventional LED, the light output intensity of the LED with AlInN cladding layers was increased due to the enhanced carrier confinement. Besides, we found the light output intensity could be saturated at higher injection current. Although the electrical property of the LED with AlInN cladding layers was slightly degraded, the experimental results in this study could explain the potential applicability of AlInN to the fabrication of cladding layers. © 2008 IEEE.

High-resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD) measurements showed that the crystalline quality of AlInN depends on the indium content, which is attributed to the effect of the lattice mismatch between AlInN and GaN. Interestingly, the formation of rod-shaped AlInN, which possibly resulted from the oxidation process, was observed after the postgrowth thermal treatment in the oxygen ambient. Furthermore, an InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well (MQW) light-emitting diode (LED) with an AlInN cladding layer was also fabricated.

The low operation voltage of the E-beam evaporated AZO LED is attributed to the deposition of low-resistivity TCLs, and the elimination of plasma damage in the p-GaN layer is attributed to use of the E-beam evaporated AZO. The high output power of the E-beam evaporated AZO LED is due to the enhancement of light extraction resulting from the high refractive index of AZO TCL. © 2008 The Electrochemical Society.

Comparing with the conventional LEDs, which the electrode pads and/or Ohmic contacts form through conventional CrAu metal contacts, the nonalloyed metal contacts (AgCrAu or AlCrAu) used in the present experimental blue LEDs also play the role of reflector to prevent the emitted light from absorption by the opaque electrode pads with low reflectivity (CrAu).

65449117230	Effect of thickness of the p-AlGaN electron blocking layer on the improvement of ESD characteristics in GaN-Based LEDs	The following letter presents a study regarding GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with p-type AlGaN electron blocking layers (EBLs) of different thicknesses. The study revealed that the LEDs could endure higher electrostatic discharge (ESD) levels as the thickness of the AlGaN EBL increased. The observed improvement in the ESD endurance ability could be attributed to the fact that the thickened p-AlGaN EBL may partly fill the dislocation-related pits that occur on the surface of the InGaN-GaN multiple-quantum well (MQW) and that are due to the strain and the low-temperature-growth process. If these dislocation-related pits are not partly suppressed, they will eventually result in numerous surface pits associated with threading dislocations that intersect the InGaN-GaN (MQW), thereby reducing the ESD endurance ability. The results of the experiment show that the ESD endurance voltages could increase from 1500 to 6000 V when the thickness of the p-AlGaN EBL in the GaN LEDs is increased from 32.5 to 130 nm, while the forward voltages and light output powers remained almost the same. © 2008 IEEE.

Furthermore, it was found that EL spectrum of the InGaN-AlInGaN MQW LED is less sensitive to the injection current.

We demonstrated that the light-waveguide mode outside the mesa region of III-nitride LEDs could be disrupted by a GaN μ-pillar around the mesa region and PSS.We found that the power enhancement of LEDs with textured sidewall, μ-pillars around the mesa, and PSS from ray-tracing simulation was about 65% larger than that of conventional LEDs. It was found that we could achieve a high power enhancement of about 60% of LEDs with textured sidewall, μ-pillars around the mesa, and a patterned substrate, and it was close to the result of simulation. It was also found that the light intensity outside the mesa region with μ-pillars of LEDs with or without a patterned substrate would decay in proportion to the distance away from the mesa edge, by studying the light emission intensity image of the whole LEDs. The decay lengths for the textured sidewall and μ-pillars around the mesa LEDs with or without a patterned substrate are 12 and 17 μm, respectively.

77249142313	Improved performance of GaN-based blue LEDs with the InGaN insertion layer between the MQW active layer and the n-GaN cladding layer	In this study, we demonstrate the effect of GaN-based blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs), using an InGaN layer inserted between the n-type GaN cladding layer and the active layer (InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well), on improving device performances. With a 20-mA current injection, the results indicate that the typical output power (or forward voltage) of light-emitting diodes grown with, and without, the InGaN insertion layer are approximately 18.1 (3.1) and 15.3(3.5) mW (V), respectively. This corresponds to an enhancement in output power (wall-plug efficiency) of around 18% (33%), with the use of the InGaN insertion layer. In addition, the electrostatic discharge (ESD) endurance voltages increased from 1000 V to 6000 V when the InGaN insertion layer was applied to the GaN/sapphire-based LEDs. The improvement of output power and ESD endurance voltage could be mainly due to the fact that the Si-doped InGaN insertion layer played the role of a current-spreading layer, which led to a lower possibility of junctions suffering a large current density in specific local sites. © 2010 IEEE.

77950537716	GaN-based light-emitting diodes with pillar structures around the mesa region	This study presents the numerical and experimental demonstrations for the enhancement of light extraction efficiency in nitride-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with textured sidewall and micro-sized pillar waveguides (TSMPW) and nano-textured sidewall and nano-pillars (NTSNP) around the mesa. Using hydrothermal ZnO nanorods as the etching hard mask, the authors successfully formed vertical GaN nano-pillars on the mesa-etched regions. It was found that electrical characteristics observed from the proposed LEDs were near the same as the control samples without the pillars. Output power enhancement of LED with TSMPW was about 11% compared with conventional LEDs, and the output power enhancement of LED was greater than 45% upon replacement of TSMPW with the NTSNP structure. The light extraction efficiency enhancement factors of the LEDs with TSMPW and NTSNP structures simulated by finite-difference time-domain analysis were 16.6% and 23%, respectively. © 2010 IEEE.

77952677214	Ga-doped ZnO/GaN Schottky barrier UV band-pass photodetector with a low-temperature-grown GaN cap layer	Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films were deposited onto low-temperature-grown (LTG) GaN/i-GaN (PD-I) and i-GaN (PD-II) epitaxy layers to form Schottky barrier UV band-pass photodetectors (PDs). The UV PDs exhibited a narrow band-pass spectral response ranging from 330 to 380 nm. It was also found that by using an LTG GaN layer on top of conventional nitride-based UV PDs, the leakage current was significantly reduced and a much larger photocurrent-to-dark-current contrast ratio was achieved. The short-wavelength cutoff at around 330nm can be attributed to the marked absorption of the GZO top contact layer. The zero-bias peak responsivities were estimated to be 0.13 and 0.08 A/W at 360nm for PD-I and PD-II, respectively. When the reverse bias was below -10 V, the dark current of PD-I was considerably below 20 pA. © 2010 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.

The forward voltages of all LED samples at 20mA were in the range of 3.1-3.2V and were sufficiently low compared with those of commercial GaN-based LEDs. In the present experiment, the 20mA output power of GaN-based LEDs with Ag/Cr/Au trilayer electrode bonding pads can be increased by a magnitude of 17% compared with those of the conventional LEDs with nonalloy Cr/Au bonding pads. Moreover, the 20mA output power of GaN-based LEDs will be increased by more than 40 and 11% by introducing PSS and Ag/Cr/Au trilayer electrode bonding pads compared with those of the conventional LEDs and PSS LEDs, respectively, with nonalloy Cr/Au bonding pads. © 2009 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.

The oxide textural films are grown by alternating current bias-assisted photoelectrochemical oxidation with an imprint technique. At an injection current of 20 mA, the light output power of the oxide-textured InGaN-GaN MQW LEDs is 22% higher than that of the conventional LEDs. Relatively low values in leakage current for the oxide-textured are also observed, as compared to the conventional LEDs. This enhancement in the oxide-textured LEDs performance is attributed to the increase in external quantum efficiency by the nanoscale roughness of the convex oxide films and to the passivation in possible leakage paths of the devices. © 2009 IEEE.

With the serial link interface Serializer/Deserializer (SerDes) added between IPs, significant amount of pin counts can be reduced in the platform. An adapter is inserted between IP and SerDes to convert parallel bus into packets and handle the handshaking. Under our proposed adapter architecture and handshaking scheme, the limitation on the number of the master adapter is eliminated compared with Bus-based Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) architecture. Simulation results show the data transfer through our proposed architecture works correctly without the limitation on the number of masters. With the proposed adapter and SerDes architecture, the number of required signals in the interconnect is reduced from 79 to two for the AHB bus. ©2010 IEEE.

Compared with unintentionally doped samples, X-ray diffraction results indicate that Si-doping in barrier layers can improve the crystal and interfacial qualities of the InGaN-GaN MQW LEDs. It was also found that the forward voltage is 3.5 and 4.52 V, the 20-mA luminous intensity is 36.1 and 25.1 mcd for LEDs with a Si-doped barrier and an unintentionally doped barrier, respectively. These results suggests that one can significantly improve the performance of InGaN-GaN MQW LEDs by introducing Si doping in the GaN barrier layers.

It was found that there were only small shifts observed in PL and EL peak positions of the blue MQW LEDs when the number of quantum well (QW) increased. However, significant shifts in PL and EL peak positions were observed in green MQW LEDs when the number of QW increased. It was also found that there was a large blue shift in EL peak position under high current injection in blue MQW LEDs. However, the blue shift in green MQW LEDs was negligibly small when the injection current was large. These observations could all be attributed to the rapid relaxation in green MQW LEDs since the In composition ratio in the InGaN well was high for the green MQW LEDs. The forward voltage V

80051688317	GaN-based light-emitting diodes with air gap array and patterned sapphire substrate	We demonstrate GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with combined air gap array and patterned sapphire substrates (PSSs). The tapered air gap array was formed on the GaN layer with or without PSS through the enhancement of the lateral growth of GaN. With the combination of air gap array and PSS, we achieved a small reverse leakage current because of the improved quality of the lateral growth-induced crystal. The 20-mA output powers of the LEDs with air gap array, PSS, and the combined air gap array and PSS improved by magnitudes of approximately 30.4%, 54.2%, and 72.9%, respectively, compared with those of conventional LEDs.

80053576725	Enhanced light output of GaN-based light-emitting diodes with embedded voids formed on Si-implanted GaN layers	GaN-based LEDs grown on Si-implanted GaN templates form air gaps beneath the active layer to enhance light-extraction efficiency. GaN-based epitaxial layers grown on selective Si-implanted regions had lower growth rates compared with those grown on implantation-free regions, resulting in selective growth and the subsequent over the Si-implanted regions. Accordingly, air gaps were formed over the Si-implanted regions after the meeting of laterally growing GaN facet fronts. The experimental results indicate that the light-output power of the LEDs grown on the Si-implanted GaN templates was enhanced by 36% compared with conventional LEDs. This enhancement in output power was attributed mainly to the air gaps, which led to a higher escape probability for the photons. © 2011 IEEE.

The up-converters exhibit a significant upconverted photoluminescence (UPL) signal. Power-dependent UPL and spectral responses indicate that the UPL emission is due to photo-carrier injection from the Mn-doped GaN layer into InGaN/GaN MQWs. Photons convert from 2.54 to 2.99 eV via a single-photon absorption process to exhibit a linear up-conversion photon energy of ~450 meV without applying bias voltage. Therefore, the up-conversion process could be interpreted within the uncomplicated energy level model. © 2011 Optical Society of America.

The finger-type ITO ohmic contacts were covered with SiO2 layers to prevent the PEC cell from generating leakage current. Using a 1M NaCl electrolyte and external biases, the typical photocurrent density and gas generation rate of the n-GaN working electrodes with ITO finger contacts were found to be higher than those with Cr/Au finger contacts. The enhancement in photocurrent density or gas generation rate can be attributed to the transparent ITO contacts which allowed the introduction of relatively more photons into the GaN layer. No significant corrosion was observed in the ITO layer after the PEC process compared with the Cr/Au finger contacts which were significantly peeled from the GaN layer. These results indicate that the use of n-GaN working electrodes with finger-type ITO ohmic contacts is a promising approach for PEC cells. © 2011 Optical Society of America.

With CSPSS, it can be seen that output powers were all significantly larger than that of LED with flat substrate (FS). Assisted by 20 min lateral etching, it was found that peripheral pyramid-like air-voids were formed on top of each cone of the CSPSS with 1.7μm height and the light output power increased by 13.8%, compared with the result of the CSPSS with 1.2μm height. Furthermore, it was also found that output power of LED prepared on 1.7μm height of CSPSS with 20 min lateral etching was 6.2 and 3.1% larger than those of LEDs prepared on 1.2μm and 1.4μm height of CSPSS with 20 min lateral etching, respectively.

The light output power of DSRS-LEDs was 30% higher than that of conventional LEDs at an injection current of 20 mA.

Compared with conventional lateral GaN/sapphire-based LEDs, GaN/Sibased vertical LEDs exhibit higher light output power and less power degradation at a high driving current, which could be attributed to the fact that vertical LEDs behave in a manner similar to flip-chip GaN/sapphire LEDs with excellent heat conduction. In addition, with an injection current of 350 mA, the output power (or forward voltage) of fabricated vertical LEDs can be enhanced (or reduced) by a magnitude of 60% (or 5%) compared with conventional GaN/sapphire-based LEDs. © 2011 Optical Society of America.

The IFITO/ p-GaN photoelectrode scheme exhibits higher photocurrent and gas generation rate compared with p-GaN photoelectrodes without IF-ITO ohmic contacts. In addition, the critical external bias for detectable hydrogen generation can be effectively reduced by the use of IF-ITO ohmic contacts. This finding can be attributed to the greatly uniform distribution of the IF-ITO/p-GaN photoelectrode applied fields over the whole working area. As a result, the collection efficiency of photo-generated holes by electrode contacts is higher than that of p-GaN photoelectrodes without IFITO contacts. Microscopy revealed a tiny change on the p-GaN surfaces before and after hydrogen generation. In contrast, photoelectrodes composed of n-GaN have a short lifetime due to n-GaN corrosion during hydrogen generation. Findings of this study indicate that the ITO finger contacts on p-GaN layer is a potential candidate as photoelectrodes for PEC hydrogen generation. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

Low-temperature up-converted photoluminescence (UPL) and the secondary ion mass spectrometry were performed on GaN-based epitaxial samples with and without Mn doping to study the effect of residual Mn on optical property. UPL emission, which originated from residual Mn doping in regrown InGaN quantum wells (QWs) because of the memory effect of the reactor, could be eliminated in an air-exposed and H2-baking manner prior to the regrowth of the QWs. Considerable residual Mn background level and slow decay rate of Mn concentration tail were also observed in the regrown epitaxial layers, which could be attributed to the memory effect or surface segregation and diffusion from the Mn-doped underlying layer during regrowth in the Mnfree reactor. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

Replacing the in situ AlN nucleation layer with the sputtered AlN nucleation layer reduced the (002) and (102) X-ray rocking curve widths of the GaN layer from 318.0 to 201.1 and 412.5 to 225.0 arcsec, respectively. The rm 20-V reverse leakage current of the LEDs with the sputtered AlN nucleation layer is about three orders less than that of the LEDs with the in situ AlN nucleation layer. In addition, the LEDs with sputtered AlN nucleation layer could sustain more than 60% passing yield on the ESD test of under a -600-V machine mode, whereas the LEDs with the in situ AlN nucleation layer sustained less than 40% passing yield. Moreover, the 20-mA output power of the LEDs with the sputtered AlN nucleation layer also improved by approximately 5.73% compared with that of the LEDs with the in situ AlN nucleation layer. © 2006 IEEE.

In addition to its absorption of the ultraviolet spectrum, Mn-doped GaN photoelectrodes could absorb photons in the visible spectrum. The photocurrents measured from PEC cells made of Mndoped GaN were at least one order higher than those measured from PEC cells made of undoped GaN-working electrodes. Under the visible light illumination and a bias voltage below 1.2 V, the Mn-doped GaN photoelectrodes could drive the water splitting reaction for hydrogen generation. However, hydrogen generation could not be achieved under the same condition wherein undoped GaN photoelectrodes were used. According to the results of the spectral responses and transmission spectra obtained from the experimental photoelectrodes, the enhanced photocurrent in the Mn-doped GaN photoelectrodes, compared with the undoped GaN photoelectrodes, was attributable to the Mn-related intermediate band within the band gap of GaN that resulted in further photon absorption. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

Two photoluminescence (PL) peaks, one originating from well-sensitive emission and one originating from an InGaN quasi-wetting layer on the GaN-barrier surface, were observed at room temperature (RT). The observation of high-order double-crystal x-ray diffraction (DCXRD) satellite peaks indicates that the interfaces between InGaN-well layers and GaN-barrier layers were not degraded as we increased the growth temperature of the GaN-barrier layers. With a 20-mA and 160-mA current injection, it was found that the output power could reach 2.2 mW and 8.9 mW, respectively. Furthermore, it was found that the reliability of the fabricated green LEDs prepared by temperature ramping was also reasonably good.

0038789057	Gigantic jets between a thundercloud and the ionosphere	Transient luminous events in the atmosphere, such as lighting-induced sprites and upwardly discharging blue jets, were discovered recently in the region between thunderclouds and the ionosphere. In the conventional picture, the main components of Earth's global electric circuit include thunderstorms, the conducting ionosphere, the downward fair-weather currents and the conducting Earth. Thunderstorms serve as one of the generators that drive current upward from cloud tops to the ionosphere, where the electric potential is hundreds of kilovolts higher than Earth's surface. It has not been clear, however, whether all the important components of the global circuit have even been identified. Here we report observations of five gigantic jets that establish a direct link between a thundercloud (altitude ∼16 km) and the ionosphere at 90 km elevation. Extremely-low-frequency radio waves in four events were detected, while no cloud-to-ground lightning was observed to trigger these events. Our result indicates that the extremely-low-frequency waves were generated by negative cloud-to-ionosphere discharges, which would reduce the electrical potential between ionosphere and ground. Therefore, the conventional picture of the global electric circuit needs to be modified to include the contributions of gigantic jets and possibly sprites.

With proper annealing, it was found that we could improve the optical properties of the ITO layers and achieve a maximum transmittance of 98% at 360 nm. GaN-based MSM UV sensors with ITO, Au, Ni, and Pt as contact electrodes were also fabricated. It was found that we could achieve a maximum 0.12 A photocurrent and a photocurrent to dark current contrast higher than five orders of magnitude for the 600°C-annealed ITO/n-GaN MSM UV sensor at a 5-V bias voltage. We also found that the maximum responsivity at 345 nm was 7.2 A/W and 0.9 A/W when the 600°C-annealed ITO/n-GaN MSM UV sensor was biased at 5 V and 0.5 V, respectively. These values were much larger than those observed from other metal/n-GaN MSM UV sensors. However, the existence of photoconductive gain in the 600°C-annealed ITO/n-GaN MSM UV sensor also results in a slower operation speed and a smaller 3-dB bandwidth as compared with the metal/n-GaN MSM UV sensors. © 2002 IEEE.

GaN-based epitaxial layers grown on the Ar-implanted AlN/sapphire (AIAS) substrates exhibited selective growth and subsequent lateral growth due to the difference of lattice constants between the implanted and implantation-free regions. Consequently, air voids over the implanted regions were formed around the GaN/AlN/sapphire interfaces. We proposed the growth mechanisms of the GaN layer on the AIAS substrates and characterized the LEDs with embedded air voids. With a 20 mA current injection, experimental results indicate that the light output power of LEDs grown on the AIAS substrates was enhanced by 25 compared with those of conventional LEDs. This enhancement can be attributed to the light scattering at the GaN/air void interfaces to increase the light extraction efficiency of the LEDs. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

After the thinning of sapphire substrate, selective dry etching process was performed on the remainder sapphire layer to expose the n-GaN contact layer instead of removing the sapphire substrate using the laser lift-off technique. These processes feature the LEDs with a sapphire-face-up structure and vertical conduction property. The PSS was adopted as a growth substrate to mitigate the light-guided effect, and thereby increase the light-extraction efficiency. Compared with conventional lateral GaN LEDs grown on PSS, the proposed vertical LEDs exhibit a higher light output power and less power degradation at a high driving current.

The transmission spectroscopy obtained from the Mn-doped GaN exhibited three distinct absorption thresholds at approximately 365, 650, and 830 nm, respectively. The below-band-gap absorption peaks were attributed to the fact that the deep Mn-related states mediate the electronic transition between the valence and conduction bands. A below-band-gap spectral response ranging from 400 nm to 1000 nm was also observed from a typical GaN p-i-n photodetector with Mn-doped absorption layer.

The FWHM of the (102) XRD spectrum of GaN on PSS increased from 470 to 580 arcsec when the initial TMGa flow rate was increased from 80 to 200 sccm. A low TMGa flow rate sufficiently suppresses GaN island growth on the top of the pattern and hence improves GaN crystal quality. The electrical and optical characteristics of GaN-based LEDs on PSS with low initial TMGa were also improved.

The GaN-based epitaxial layers grown on the Ar-implanted sapphire substrates (Ar-ISS) exhibited selective growth and subsequent lateral growth because of different lattice constants between the implantation and implantation-free regions. As a result, air voids were formed at the GaN/sapphire interface, above the implanted regions and below the active layers of LEDs. We proposed the GaN layer growth mechanisms on the Ar-ISS, and characterized the LEDs with embedded air voids at the GaN/sapphire interface. Using a 20-mA current injection, the light output of the experimental LEDs was found to be 15% greater than that of conventional LEDs. This enhancement can be attributed to the light scattering at the textured GaN/air void interfaces, which increases the probability of photons escaping from the LEDs. © 1983-2012 IEEE.

84881628464	Improved conversion efficiency of GaN-based solar cells with Mn-doped absorption layer	GaN-based solar cells with Mn-doped absorption layer grown by metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy were investigated. The transmittance spectrum and the spectral response showed the presence of an Mn-related band absorption property. Power-dependent, dual-light excitation, and lock-in amplifier techniques were performed to confirm if the two-photon absorption process occurred in the solar cells with Mn-doped GaN absorption layer. Although a slight decrease in an open circuit voltage was observed, a prominent increase in the short circuit current density resulted in a significant enhancement of the overall conversion efficiency. Under one-sun air mass 1.5 G standard testing condition, the conversion efficiency of Mn-doped solar cells can be enhanced by a magnitude of 5 times compared with the cells without Mn-doped absorption layer. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

84882279365	Numerical study of the suppressed efficiency droop in blue InGaN LEDs with polarization-matched configuration	In blue InGaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the intuitive approaches to suppress Auger recombination by reducing carrier density, e.g., increasing the number of quantum wells (QWs) and thickening the width of wells, suffer from nonuniform carrier distribution and more severe spatial separation of electron and hole wave functions. To resolve this issue, LED structures with thick InGaN wells and polarization-matched AlGaInN barriers are proposed theoretically. Furthermore, the number of QWs is reduced for the purpose of mitigating the additional compressive strain in AlGaInN barriers. Simulation results reveal that, in the proposed structures, the quantum-confined Stark effect in strained wells is nearly eliminated through the utilization of polarization-matched barriers, which efficiently promotes internal quantum efficiency. Furthermore, the phenomenon of efficiency droop is also markedly improved because of the uniformly distributed or dispersed carriers, and accordingly the suppressed Auger recombination. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

84884929222	GaN-based light emitting diodes with micro- and nano-patterned structures by femtosecond laser nonlinear decomposition	The multiple micro/nano-patterning on p-GaN surface by femtosecond (fs) laser irradiation through a micro-ball lens array (MBLA) mask has been established to improve the light extraction efficiency of GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs). This technique was meant for the high-speed surface micro/nano-patterning of a p-GaN surface on a large area using fs laser irradiation. Compared with conventional LEDs with flat surfaces, dual-scale roughened structures on p-GaN surface LEDs used in the present experiment scatter and increase the effective critical angle, increasing the escape probability of photons. The relationship of the hole size on p-GaN surface and the refractive index of the MBLA material would be also discussed. With an injection current of 20 mA, the output power of the experimental LEDs markedly improved by a magnitude of 48% compared with conventional GaN-based LEDs. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

84884571964	Dual-wavelength GaN-based LEDs grown on truncated hexagonal pyramids formed by selective-area regrowth on Si-implanted GaN templates	GaN-based blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with micro truncated hexagonal pyramid (THP) array were grown on selective-area Siimplanted GaN (SIG) templates. The GaN epitaxial layer regrown on the SIG templates exhibited selective growth and subsequent lateral growth to form the THP array. The observed selective-area growth was attributed to the different crystal structures between the Si-implanted and implantation-free regions. Consequently, LEDs grown on the GaN THP array emitted broad electroluminescence spectra with multiple peaks. Spatially resolved cathodoluminescence revealed that the broad spectra originated from different areas within each THP. Transmission electron microscopy showed the GaN-based epitaxial layers, including InGaN/GaN multi-quantum wells regrown at different growth rates (or with different In content in the InGaN wells) between the semi-polar and c-face planes of each THP. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

84884593998	Embedded transition inversion coding with low switching activity for serial links	Serial link interconnection has been proposed for its advantages of reducing crosstalk and area. However, serializing parallel buses tends to increase bit transition and power dissipation. Several coding schemes, such as serial followed by encoding (SE) and transition inversion coding (TIC), have been proposed to reduce bit transition. TIC is capable of decreasing transitions by 15% compared to the SE scheme, but an extra indication bit is added in every data word to represent inversion occurrence. The extra bit increases the transmission overhead and the bit transitions. This paper proposes an embedded transition inversion (ETI) coding scheme that uses the phase difference between the clock and data in the transmitted serial data to tackle the problem of the extra indication bit. The ETI coding scheme reduces the transition by up to 31% compared to SE scheme. The analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed coding scheme produces a low bit transition for different kinds of data patterns. Using the optimum degree of multiplexing, width, and spacing, the ETI coding scheme achieves 30%-60% energy reduction compared with the parallel bus without overhead. Taking circuit overhead into consideration, the power saving is up to 31.71% and 26.46% at a clock cycle of 250 ps for the 90-and 130-nm CMOS technology for m=2 where m is the number of parallel wires multiplexed into a serial link. © 2012 IEEE.

84886510564	An RFID tag system-on-chip with wireless ECG monitoring for intelligent healthcare systems	This paper presents a low-power wireless ECG acquisition system-on-chip (SoC), including an RF front-end circuit, a power unit, an analog front-end circuit, and a digital circuitry. The proposed RF front-end circuit can provide the amplitude shift keying demodulation and distance to digital conversion to accurately receive the data from the reader. The received data will wake up the power unit to provide the required supply voltages of analog front-end (AFE) and digital circuitry. The AFE, including a pre-amplifier, an analog filter, a post-amplifier, and an analog-to-digital converter, is used for the ECG acquisition. Moreover, the EPC Class I Gen 2 UHF standard is employed in the digital circuitry for the handshaking of communication and the control of the system. The proposed SoC has been implemented in 0.18-μm standard CMOS process and the measured results reveal the communication is compatible to the RFID protocol. The average power consumption for the operating chip is 12 μW. Using a Sony PR44 battery to the supply power (605mAh@1.4V), the RFID tag SoC operates continuously for about 50,000 hours (>5 years), which is appropriate for wireless wearable ECG monitoring systems. © 2013 IEEE.

0041510353	Characterization of GaN Schottky barrier photodetectors with a low-temperature GaN cap layer	A report on the characterization of GaN Schottky barrier photodetectors with a low-temperature GaN cap layer was presented in the article. It was found that the leakage currents can be reduced and a much larger photocurrent to dark contrast ratio can be achieved by introducing a low temperature GaN on top of the conventional nitride-based ultraviolet photodiodes. It was also found that the operation speed of sample A is slower than that of sample B due to the highly resistive low temperature GaN layer induced large RC time constant.

0043028452	Nitride-based green light-emitting diodes with high temperature GaN barrier layers	High-quality InGaN-GaN multiquantum well (MQW) light-emitting diode (LED) structures were prepared by temperature ramping method during metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth. It was found that we could reduce the 20-mA forward voltage and increase the output intensity of the nitride-based green LEDs by increasing the growth temperature of GaN barrier layers from 700 °C to 950 °C. The 20-mA output power and maximum output power of the nitride-based green LEDs with high temperature GaN barrier layers was found to be 2.2 and 8.9 mW, respectively, which were more than 65% larger than those observed from conventional InGaN-GaN green LEDs. Such an observation could be attributed to the improved crystal quality of GaN barrier layers. The reliability of these LEDs was also found to be reasonably good.

84888330640	GaN-Based ultraviolet light emitting diodes with Ex situ sputtered AlN nucleation layer	We demonstrated the electro-optical characteristics of gallium nitride (GaN)-based ultraviolet (UV) light emitting diodes (LEDs) with sputtered aluminum nitride (AlN) nucleation layer. The introduction of the ex situ sputtered AlN nucleation layer improved the crystal quality of the GaN and the n-AlGaN layer of the GaN-based UV LEDs. Hence, the 20-mA output power of UV LEDs with ex situ AlN nucleation layers is higher than that of UV LEDs with GaN nucleation layers. In addition, the enhanced power output of UV LEDs with ex situ AlN nucleation could reach around 52% in magnitude at peak emission wavelengths of 370 nm compared with power outputs of UV LEDs with GaN nucleation layers. Furthermore, UV LEDs with ex situ AlN nucleation show improved reliability. The UV LEDs with ex situ AlN nucleation layer revealed a power output drop of around 9% within 168 hours , which is less than the around 14% power drop of UV LEDs with GaN nucleation layer. © 2013 IEEE.

84889588552	InGaN Flip-Chip light-emitting diodes with embedded air voids as light-scattering layer	The performance of GaN-based flip-chip light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with embedded air voids grown on a selective-area Ar-implanted sapphire (SAS) substrate was demonstrated in this letter. The GaN-based epitaxial layers grown on Ar-implanted regions exhibited lower growth rates compared with those grown on implantation-free regions. Accordingly, air voids formed over the implanted regions after merging laterally grown GaN facet fronts. The light-output power of LEDs grown on SAS was greater than that of LEDs grown on implantation-free sapphire substrates. The output power of LEDs grown on SAS was enhanced by 20% at an injection current of 700 mA. The increase in output power was mainly attributed to the scattering of light around the air voids, which increased the probability of photons escaping from the LEDs. © 2013 IEEE.

84899820754	Effects of InGaN layer thickness of AlGaN/InGaN superlattice electron blocking layer on the overall efficiency and efficiency droops of GaN-based light emitting diodes	The operating voltage, light output power, and efficiency droops of GaN-based light emitting diodes (LEDs) were improved by introducing Mg-doped AlGaN/InGaN superlattice (SL) electron blocking layer (EBL). The thicker InGaN layers of AlGaN/InGaN SL EBL could have a larger effective electron potential height and lower effective hole potential height than that of AlGaN EBL. This thicker InGaN layer could prevent electron leakage into the p-region of LEDs and improve hole injection efficiency to achieve a higher light output power and less efficiency droops with the injection current. The low lateral resistivity of Mg-doped AlGaN/InGaN SL would have superior current spreading at high current injection. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84899880518	Terahertz plasmonic waveguide based on metal rod arrays for nanofilm sensing	A high-aspect-ratio metallic rod array is demonstrated to generate and propagate highly confined terahertz (THz) surface plasmonic waves under end-fire excitation. The transverse modal power distribution and spectral properties of the bound THz plasmonic wave are characterized in two metallic rod arrays with different periods and in two configurations with and without attaching a subwavelength superstrate. The integrated metallic rod array-based waveguide can be used to sense the various thin films deposited on the polypropylene superstrate based on the phasesensitive mechanism. The sensor exhibits different phase detection sensitivities depending on the modal power immersed in the air gaps between the metallic rods. Deep-subwavelength SiO2 and ZnO nanofilms with an optical path difference of 252 nm, which is equivalent to ?/3968 at 0.300 THz, are used as analytes to test the integrated plasmonic waveguide. Analysis of the refractive index and thickness of molecular membranes indicates that the metallic rod array-based THz waveguide can integrate various biochip platforms for minute molecular detection, which is extremely less than the coherent length of THz waves. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84899882047	Optoelectrical characteristics of green lightemitting diodes containing thick InGaN wells with digitally grown InN/GaN	Compared with conventionally grown thin InGaN wells, thick InGaN wells with digitally grown InN/GaN exhibit superior optical properties. The activation energy (48 meV) of thick InGaN wells (generated by digital InN/GaN growth from temperature-dependent integrated photoluminescence intensity) is larger than the activation energy (25 meV) of conventionally grown thin InGaN wells. Moreover, thick InGaN wells with digitally grown InN/GaN exhibit a smaller s value (the degree of localization effects) of 19 meV than that of conventionally grown thin InGaN wells (23 meV). Compared with green light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with conventional thin InGaN wells, the improvement in 20-A/cm2 output power for LEDs containing thick InGaN wells with digitally grown InN/GaN is approximately 23%. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84922715751	Improved light extraction of nitride-based flip-chip light-emitting diodes by forming air voids on Ar-implanted sapphire substrate	GaN-based flip-chip light emitting diodes (FC-LEDs) with embedded air voids grown on a selective-area Arimplanted AlN/sapphire (AIAS) substrate was demonstrated in this study. The proposed FC LED with an embedded light scattering layer can destroy the light interference and thereby increase the LEE of GaN-based flip-chip LEDs. The epitaxial layers grown on Ar-implanted regions exhibited lower growth rates compared with those grown on implantation-free regions. Accordingly, air voids formed over the implanted regions after merging laterally grown GaN facet fronts. The light-output power of LEDs grown on AIAS was greater than that of LEDs grown on implantation free sapphire substrates. At an injection current of 700 mA, the output power of LEDs grown on AIAS was enhanced by 20% compared with those of LEDs without embedded air voids. The increase in output power was mainly attributed to the scattering of light around the air voids, which increased the probability of photons escaping from the LEDs. This study on FC LEDs with embedded light-scattering layer highlights the potential application of these LEDs as an alternative to conventional patterned sapphire substrates for improving the LEE of GaN/sapphire-based LEDs. Based on ray tracing simulation, if the height and the width of bottom of gaps were increased to 3 μm, the Lop could be enhanced over 60%.
