84939887850	Reducing the Entropic Uncertainty via Non-Markovian Effect and Detuning in the Presence of Quantum Memory <sup>∗</sup>	The influence of non-Markovian effect and detuning on the entropic uncertainty in the presence of quantum memory is studied by the time-convolutionless master-equation approach. The result shows that the entropic uncertainty in the presence of quantum memory is obviously dependent on both detuning and non-Markovian effect. The bigger the detuning is and the stronger the non-Markovian effect is, the smaller the entropic uncertainty is. Its physical explanation is that the known quantum information stored in the quantum memory can reduce or eliminate the entropic uncertainty about the measurement outcomes of another particle, which is entangled with the quantum memory.

20044392696	Minimum entropy for the space solar telescope automatic focus	The novel remote sensor of the Space Solar Telescope (SST) is scheduled for launch in 2008. It will be uniquely designed to be the world's first facility capable of observing with γ = 0.1 spatial resolution in vector magnetograms in the photosphere and the chromosphere, and 0.5 in soft X-rays. The high spatial resolution makes the on-orbit automatic focus (AF) the key technique to catch images. The paper brings forward a new method of the minimum entropy (ME) criterion for the astro-observation. Further more, we have applied such technology to the on-orbit AF of SST. The emulational program calculated the image entropies of different off-focus states. Data indicate that the minimum image entropy is corresponding to the optimal image plane; the ME criterion is more suitable for the heavenly bodies of low contrast and the focusing precision is 0.01 mm (δ = 0.01mm).

The three-body entanglement is the result of the coherent superposition of the two-body entanglements. The larger the two-body entanglement is, the stronger the three-body entanglement is. On the other hand, if there exists a great difference in three two-body entanglement measures, the three-body entanglement is very weak.

32644443500	The effect of quantum noise on the restricted quantum game	It has recently been established that quantum strategies have great advantage over classical ones in quantum games. However, quantum states are easily affected by the quantum noise resulting in decoherence. In this paper, we investigate the effect of quantum noise on the restricted quantum game in which one player is restricted in classical strategic space, another in quantum strategic space and only the quantum player is affected by the quantum noise. Our results show that in the maximally entangled state, no Nash equilibria exist in the range of 0<p≤0.422 (p is the quantum noise parameter), while two special Nash equilibria appear in the range of 0.422<p<1. The advantage that the quantum player diminished only in the limit of maximum quantum noise. Increasing the amount of quantum noise leads to the increase of the classical player's payoff and the reduction of the quantum player's payoff, but is helpful in forming two Nash equilibria. © 2006 Chin.

We realize the three kinds of two-qubit quantum phase gates, i.e. QPG operation involving the cavity mode as well as the vibrational mode of the trapped ion, QPG operation involving the internal states as well as the vibrational mode of the trapped ion and QPG operation involving the internal states of the trapped ion as well as the cavity mode. The controlled-NOT gate can be implemented from a QPG operation through a rotation of the second qubit before and after the QPG operation. We can also perform the SWAP gate operation involving the ionic internal states of the trapped ion and the two-mode bosonic basis. The logic gates involving the cavity mode as well as the vibrational mode of the trapped ion are insensitive to spontaneous emission, and the logic gates involving the internal states as well as the vibrational mode of the trapped ion are insensitive to the decay of the cavity, which is an important feature for the practical implementation of quantum computing.

80052268702	Quantum Discord of Two Atoms Interacting with a Single-mode Thermal Field	This paper investigates the quantum discord and entanglement of two atoms when they simultaneously interact with a single-mode thermal field. The results show that, the two atoms which are initially in separate states can be entangled by a thermal field. However, with increase of the mean photon number, the value of the entanglement decreases and disappears when the temperature of the cavity is high enough (corresponding to the large value of the mean photon number). In stark contrast, the quantum discord does not decrease, but gradually reaches stable value at high temperature. In addition, when the two atoms are initially the Werner mixed state, we have found that, a large amount of quantum discord is exist even in the region where the entanglement is zero, which is a strong signature for the presence of non classical correlations. These results indicate that, the quantum discord is more resistant to the environment's disturbance than the entanglement for higher temperatures. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

In the weak-coupling Markovian region, quantum discord exhibits exponent decay without revival, and can be well protected by increasing the average classical noise switching rate. While in the strong-coupling non-Markovian region, quantum discord reveals slowly decayed oscillations with quick revival by decreasing the average switching rate of the classical noise. Thus, our results provide a new method of protecting quantum discord in a two-qubit system by controlling the coupling between the qubits and classical noise, and the average switching rate of the classical noise. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

The results show that, only if the two non-Markovian reservoirs are identical, increasing detuning and non-Markovian effect can reduce the lower bound of the entropic uncertainty relation, lengthen the time region during which the entanglement can be witnessed, and effectively protect the entanglement region witnessed by the lower bound of the entropic uncertainty relation. The results can be applied in quantum measurement, quantum cryptography tasks and quantum information processing.

84925490709	Dynamics and Protection of Quantum Discord for Two Uncoupled Qubits Driven by Classical Phase Noisy Laser	In this paper, the dynamics and protection of quantum discord for two uncoupled qubits driven by classical phase noisy laser(CPNL) is investigated. The results show that, the dynamics of quantum discord depends on the ratio of CPNL rate and the system-environment coupling strength. The quantum discord can be well protected by increasing the ratio in the Markovian classical noise region or by decreasing the ratio in the non-Markovian classical noise region. Besides, we explain the revivals of the quantum discord by means of the increase of parameter used to quantify non-Markovianty of the single qubit dynamics in the non-Markovian classical noise region.

It is shown that the scheme can also be used to create multi-atom cluster state. During the interaction between atom and cavity, the cavity is only virtually excited and thus the scheme is insensitive to the cavity field states and cavity decay. With the help of our scheme it is very simple to prepare the N-atom cluster state with perfect fidelity and probability. The practical feasibility of this method is also discussed. © 2008 Chin. Phys.

4444315835	Entanglement manipulation for a two-mode squeezed vacuum state	By numerically analysing the entropy of entanglement of the output state from a Mach-Zehnder interferometer for the two-mode squeezed vacuum state input, it is found that if the internal phase shift of the interferometer is adjusted to the value of 0 or 7r, the entangling characteristic of the input state is efficiently preserved at the output. If the internal phase shift is tuned to the value of τ/2, the two-mode squeezed vacuum state is completely disentangled at the output of the setup. It the internal phase shift deviates from the above values, the input state is degraded into a partially entangled output state. Based on these results, a method for optically realizing the entanglement preservation, entanglement degradation, and disentanglement via the interferometer is obtained.

The dependences of the thermal entanglement of the teleported state on the DM coupling constant, the temperature and the entanglement of the noisy quantum channel are studied in detail for both the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic cases. The result shows that a minimum entanglement of the noisy quantum channel must be provided in order to realize the entanglement teleportation. The values of fidelity of the teleported state are also studied for these two cases. It is found that under certain conditions, we can transfer an initial state with a better fidelity than that for any classical communication protocol. © 2008 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.

The results show that the amplitude and the period of the atom-atom entanglement evolution can be controlled by the choice of initial state and relative coupling strength, respectively. We find that the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death (ESD) is sensitive to the initial conditions. The length of the time interval for zero entanglement depends not only on the initial degree of entanglement between two atoms but also on the relative coupling strength of atom-field interaction. The ESD effect can be weakened by enhancing the mode-mode competition between the three-and single-photon processes. © 2009 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.

For the initial atomic state |Ψ(0)〈, whether the atoms are initially separated or entangled, a large or even maximal entanglement between them can be obtained periodically by introducing the mode-mode competition. For the initial atomic state |Φ(0)〈, the strong mode-mode competition can prevent the two atoms entangled initially from suffering entanglement sudden death; besides, it makes them in a more stable and longer-lived entanglement than in the non-competition case. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

Assuming that deviation of laser intensity is 0.01 and that of simultaneity for the interaction is 0.01, it shows that the fidelity of the resulting four-atom entangled cluster state is about 0.9886. The scheme can also be used to generate a four-ion entangled cluster state in a hot trapped-ion system.

It is found that the average fidelity of teleportation depends on the type and rate of the damping in the channel. For the one-qubit affected case, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state is as robust as the W state, i.e., the same quantum information is preserved through teleportation. For the two-qubit affected case, the W state is more robust when the entanglement is distributed via the amplitude damping channel; if the entanglement is distributed via the phase damping channel, the W state is more robust when the noisy parameter is small while the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state becomes more robust when it is large.

It is found that the sum of the square of the pairwise quantum discords and the sum of the square of the pairwise concurrences are both conserved in the strong dipole-dipole interaction limit. However, in the middle dipole-dipole and weak dipole-dipole interaction limits, the sum of the square of the pairwise concurrences is still conserved while the sum of the square of the pairwise discords is not. The crucial reason for this is that the quantum discords are not equivalent if the measurements are performed on different subsystems in a general situation.

The thermal environment can also induce a stable amplification of the initially prepared quantum discord for certain X-type states. It is very valuable that the quantum discord is more resistant against the thermal environment than quantum entanglement.

Then we utilized entropy squeezing to examine the influences of the non-Markovian effect and detuning on the atomic squeezing. It is interesting to note that atomic squeezing can be protected for a long time when both the non-Markovian effect and detuning are present simultaneously.

84864832315	Distillability sudden death in a two qutrit systems under a thermal reservoir	The dynamics of distillability entanglement between qutrit - qutrit systems interacting with a thermal reservoir is investigated in this paper. We discovered an interesting phenomenon that under a thermal reservoir certain initially prepared free-entangled states become bound-entangled states in a finite time, which is called distillability sudden death (DSD). We use a realignment criterion to measure the nine-dimensional density matrix of the entanglement. Moreover, we analyze some other parameters to investigate the effects to the systems. Explanations are then given. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84869785614	Atomic entropy squeezing of the Jaynes-Cummings model driven by classical fields in non-Markovian environment	The atomic entropy squeezing of the Jaynes-Cummings model driven by classical fields in non-Markovian environment is investigated according to the non-Markovian quantum theory and the entropy squeezing theory. Our attention is focused on the influences of the non-Markovian effects, the Rabi frequencys of classical fields and the detuning on the atomic entropy squeezing. And we explain the atomic entropy squeezing dynamic by the memory effects of the non-Markovian processes. It is found that the atomic entropy squeezing can be maintained for a long time when both the Rabi frequencys of classical fields and the non-Markovian effect are present simultaneously. And we can obtain the optimal squeezing states by choosing appropriate parameters of the Rabi frequency and the detuning of classical field. Our results provide a potential method of generating high-degree squeezed and longtime atomic squeezing states by controlling the atom-field interaction. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society.

0043262820	Quantum mechanical channel and quantum mutual entropy in the two-photon Jaynes-Cummings model	We have studied the dynamics of the two-photon Jaynes-Cummings model (TPJCM) by using the quantum information theory, given the quantum mechanical channel representing the state change of atom, derived the quantum mutual entropy and reduced entropy of the atom, and examined the effects of the phase coherence of initial cavity field and the Stark shift of atomic levels on the quantum mutual entropy in the TPJCM. It is shown that quantum mutual entropy evolves periodically, quantum mechanical channel transmits periodically the information of atomic initial state to its final states, and quantum mechanical channel and mutual entropy are also dependent on the phase coherence of initial cavity field and on the Stark shift of atomic levels.

0242271283	Using the minimum entropy as a criterion for the in-orbit automatic focussing of space solar telescope	The automatic focusing (AF) is a key technology for the in-orbit imaging processing of space solar telescope (SST) because of the complicated launch condition, dynamic in-orbit space environment and its high angle resolution (γ=0.1'). The new minimum entropy (ME) criterion of the off-focus state is put forward based on the analysis of the definition feature of the off-focus states. The method of ME is more suitable for the space camera and the observation of the heavenly bodies of low contrast. The image of a given object formed by an optical system is shown using the emulation program, and the imaging entropy of different off-focus states is calculated. The data indicates that precision is l‰ (δ=1‰). The technology will be applied to automatic focusing of the space solar telescope in 2005.

84891586726	The squeezing dynamics of two independent atoms by detuning in two non-Markovian environments	The squeezing dynamics of two independent two-level atoms off-resonantly coupled to two non-Markovian reservoirs is studied by the time-convolutionless master-equation approach. We find that the squeezing of two atoms is dependent on both detuning and the non-Markovian effect. Our results show that, in the non-Markovian regime, the bigger the detuning and the stronger the non-Markovian effect are, the larger the strength of the squeezing is. And the squeezing of two atoms can be effectively protected for a long time when both the non-Markovian effect and detuning are present simultaneously. The physical mechanism is that the detuning not only can promote the feedback of information from the environment into the atomic system but also can greatly suppress the atomic decay in the non-Markovian regime. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84892851692	Dissipative Dynamics of Quantum Discord of Two Strongly Driven Qubits	The exact dynamics of quantum discord (QD) of two strongly driven qubits, which are initially prepared in the X-type quantum states and inserted in two independent dissipative cavities or in a common dissipative cavity, are studied. The results indicate that both in the two cases, the evolution of QD is independent of the initial cavity state. For the two independent dissipative cavities, it is found that the phenomenon of sudden transition between classical and quantum decoherence exists and the transition time can be greatly delayed by suitably choosing the initial state parameter of the two qubits, the cavity mode-driving field detunning and the decay rate of the cavity. For the common dissipative cavity, it is shown that for some initial states of the two qubits, the QD can increase for a finite time at first, and then it decreases to a steady value, while for some other initial states, the QD can increase monotonously or with oscillation till a stable value is reached. Moreover, the creation of QD for the two qubits in a common cavity is discussed. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84893734149	Coherence-controlled stationary entanglement between two atoms embedded in a bad cavity injected with squeezed vacuum	We investigate the entanglement between two atoms in an overdamped cavity injected with squeezed vacuum when these two atoms are initially prepared in coherent states. It is shown that the stationary entanglement exhibits a strong dependence on the initial state of the two atoms when the spontaneous emission rate of each atom is equal to the collective spontaneous emission rate, corresponding to the case where the two atoms are close together. It is found that the stationary entanglement of two atoms increases with decreasing effective atomic cooperativity parameter. The squeezed vacuum can enhance the entanglement of two atoms when the atoms are initially in coherent states. Valuably, this provides us with a feasible way to manipulate and control the entanglement, by changing the relative phases and the amplitudes of the polarized atoms and by varying the effective atomic cooperativity parameter of the system, even though the cavity is a bad one. When the spontaneous emission rate of each atom is not equal to the collective spontaneous emission rate, the steady-state entanglement of two atoms always maintains the same value, as the amplitudes of the polarized atoms varies. Moreover, the larger the degree of two-photon correlation, the stronger the steady-state entanglement between the atoms. © 2014 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.

84894905308	Asymmetric "4+2" protocol for quantum key distribution with finite resources	In this paper, we present an asymmetric "4+2" protocol for quantum key distribution with finite photon pulses. The main work of this paper focuses on the composable security proof for this protocol in a finite-key scenario. Based on the essence security basis of the original "4+2" protocol proposed by Huttner et al. (Phys Rev A 51(3):1863-1869, 1995), we first develop the squashing model for this protocol with the quantum non-demolition measure theory. From this model, against the collective photon-number-splitting attack, we then provide the security proof (formulas of finite-key security bounds) for this protocol. The expected performance of this protocol are also evaluated on a priori reasonable expected values of parameters. Our work shows that the performance we derived is the lower one and it can cover long distances in the lossy channel. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84894028863	Preserving entanglement and the fidelity of three-qubit quantum states undergoing decoherence using weak measurement	We demonstrate a method to preserve entanglement and improve fidelity of three-qubit quantum states undergoing amplitude-damping decoherence using weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal. It is shown that we are able to enhance entanglement to the greatest extent, and to circumvent entanglement sudden death by increasing the weak measurement strength both for the GHZ state and the W state. The weak measurement technique can also enhance the fidelity to the quantum region and even close to 1 for the whole range of the decoherence parameter in both of the two cases. In addition, the W state can maintain more fidelity than the GHZ state in the protection protocol. However, the GHZ state has a higher success probability than the W state. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84903374244	Entanglement purification and amplification of three-qubit states using two-outcome weak measurements	We demonstrate a method for the optimal purification of the asymmetric state, the symmetric state and the state from partially entangled pure states using two-outcome weak measurements. We obtain two different final states by setting different measurement strengths for the same initial state. The total success probability is related to the initial pure state parameters. We also show that the entanglement amplification can be achieved both for mixed state and mixed state by applying this local weak measurements. The approach requires a small cost because a lot of copies and two-body or multibody measurements are not needed. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.

84908689734	Non-Markovianity for a qubit system driven by a classical phase noisy laser	In this paper, the degree of non-Markovian behaviour for a qubit system driven by a classical phase noisy laser (CPNL) is investigated. We analyse the dynamics of the rate of change of the trace distance in two different dynamical regimes in relation to the values of the system parmeters. The results show that the behaviour of the non-Markovianity depends on the ratio of the CPNL rate and the system-environment coupling strength. In the non-Markovian classical noise region, the non-Markovian character becomes less evident when the ratio of the CPNL rate and the system-environment coupling increases.

84913569084	Distillability sudden death in two-qutrit systems with external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction due to decoherence	Recently, Mazhar Ali (Phys. Rev. A, 81 (2010) 042303 and J. Phys. B, 43 (2010) 045504) showed the phenomenon of distillability sudden death (DSD) in qutrit-qutrit systems under amplitude damping. In this paper, the phenomenon of distillability sudden death in two-qutrit systems which are in the presence of the external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction under decoherence has been investigated. With the help of the realignment criterion, we show that certain initial prepared free entangled states may become bound entangled states in a finite time. Moreover, the effects of the external magnetic field strength and the DM interaction parameter, as well as the intrinsic decoherence parameter on the possibility of DSD in our model have been studied in detail.
