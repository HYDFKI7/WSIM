The impact energy and Rockwell hardness of the samples were tested. The results indicate that with an increase in vanadium content, the microstructure of medium chromium white cast iron becomes finer and the impact energy values are enhanced. When the mass fraction of vanadium exceeds 4%, a large amount of VC precipitates occur, which make the cast iron have potentially favorable wear resistance.

2442715550	Approximate algorithm for calculation of the failure probability of a system	A approximate algorithm for calculation of the failure probability of a system is presented. An equivalent linear failure mode is introduced to approximate the conditional failure mode. An approximate algorithm for calculating the system reliability of parallel structures is obtained based on the principle of conditional probability and the theoretical expression of conditional failure mode. A complicated calculation of failure probability of a group of failure mode intersection is simplified to the calculation of probability product of a group of equivalent linear failure modes. Because the serial system and the mixed system can be expressed as a linear superposition of a series of failure mode intersection, the algorithm is suitable to the calculation of failure probability of the serial system and the mixed system. This algorithm is also adaptable to the reliability analysis of large structure systems.

25144477549	Transverse dynamic analysis of large scale aqueduct with fluid-structure coupling	The aqueduct is the thin wall-bar structure. In this dynamical analysis model, the transversal, vertical, longitudinal and freely torsion deformations, the constrained torsion deformation as well as fluid-structure coupling between aqueduct and water body are all taken into consideration. Based on the theory of Volasov and Housner, the transversal dynamical analysis model with fluid-structure coupling is established for thin wall-bar structure. The element stiffness and mass matrices of the aqueduct thin wall are derived by energy variation principle. The analytical formulations are deduced in the cases of no water and the design water level in aqueduct. Using this model, the frequencies in several cases are calculated and compared. The result shows that the frequencies are changed in one case with water and in the other case without water. The model is simple and practical for dynamic analysis of the fluid-structure coupling aqueduct.

Based on the characteristics of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm, a new approach, Genetic and Simulated Annealing Hybrid Algorithm, is put forward to backcalculate the elasticity modulus of pavement structure.

33646139401	Calculation of bulk-solid pressures in squat silos	There are several ways to calculate the lateral pressure of squat silos. The most popular are Rankine and Coulomb earth pressure theories which are based on the consideration that the soil behind the retaining wall is two-dimensional plane. So they may not be suitable for a silo wall whose projection is circular on the plane. Furthermore, it is almost acceptable that the wall pressures vary linearly with depth according to the above two theories. Nonetheless, the bulk-solid pressure may not distribute linearly with depth because a bulk-solid behaves very differently from a fluid. The real pressure distribution law and calculation methods are studied. Based on the limits equivalent theory and through rigorous mathematical deduction, the curvilinear lateral pressure distribution is acquired. The results are in good agreement with that of the full-size silo experiment for both the horizontal plane top and the conical pile top of the stored bulk material, while Rankine's formula and Coulomb's formula are not accurate for the two cases.

The most popular are Rankine and Coulomb earth pressure theories which are based on the consideration that the soil behind the retaining wall is two-dimensional plane. Hence these methods may not be suitable for a silo wall whose projection is circular on the plane.

There is no appropriate formula for the calculation of the wall pressures, and the overpressure problem caused by top pile is not well solved yet. To solve these problems, two calculation methods for the wall pressures are proposed. One is by applying the limit equilibrium theory to the stored bulk materials directly, and the other is the modification of Coulomb formula by the volume ratio of two granular materials forms considering the line walls and the squat silos. According to such factors as the top shape of the granular materials in silos and the possible plane of rupture, two cases are discussed, and a simplest analytical method is given for different cases. The methods are validated by the full-sized bunker experiment.

The fractional softening was evaluated by use of the offset method, which was confirmed to be a very reasonable method. Appropriate expressions are given for the static recrystallization kinetics as a function of temperature and strain rate. Particular attention is paid to the effect of strain rate on static recrystallization. It can be shown that the static softening is apparently accelerated by strain rate. Recrystallization in low temperature austenitic region is stopped due to precipitation of carbonitrides of microalloying elements, which is reflected in the form of a plateau in the curves of static softening.

77954515345	Mechanical parameters identification of surrounding rock based on wavelet SVM	The form of kernel function influences much on the generalization ability of a support vector machine (SVM). By using RBF kernel function in common use for displacement back analysis at present, however, it is impossible through translation to construct a complete orthogonal basis for the square integrable space, so it is difficult to approximate a complicated function in this space and to achieve a good precision of parameter identification. Fortunately, wavelet functions have many excellent features, particularly the multidimensional admissive SVM kernel functions such as Littlewood-Paley wavelets that can approximate through expansion and translation an arbitray square integrable function with high precision and enhance generalization ability of the resulted SVM. This paper proposes a new back analysis method of rock mechanical parameters based on Littlewood-Paley wavelet kernel functions and least squares SVM(LS-SVM). Application of this LSSVM model to identification of the rock parameters for a pumped storage power station demonstrates a better accuracy than that of RBF kernels. The LS-SVM back analysis using the measured data of rock displacements shows the inversion parameters close to the experimental values, which verifies the reliability and the validity of the proposed method. ©Copyright.

Under overload vehicles, the concrete hinges of such bride are easily damaged, which usually causes single slab bearing and tremendously reduces the bridge's load capacity. It is necessary to take some reinforcement measures to enhance the carrying capacity of such impaired bridge for traffic safety. In this paper, a field reinforcement experiment of an actual hollow slab bridge, which has experienced a destructive test with its transverse connections seriously damaged, was performed by applying external transverse and longitudinal prestress to it. The strengthening scheme adopted in this experiment was detailed. By means of static truck load test, the variation of deflections of the bridge before and after strengthening was obtained. The test results showed that the proposed strengthening method can effectively enhance the damaged hollow slab bridge's transverse stiffness and improve its bearing capacity. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

56849127920	Effect of rainfall infiltration on stability of mudstone-soil mixture embankment	Rainfall infiltration into mudstone-soil mixture embankment is one of the most important factors affecting slope stability. In order to understand the landslide mechanism of mixture embankment induced by rainfall infiltration, the artificial rainfall simulation tests are carried out on a typical highway mudstone-soil mixture embankment of Jiyuan-Shaoyuan expressway. Some field variables of embankment slope during the rainfall are monitored, such as pore water pressure, stress state, deformation and surface displacement of soils. The influences of mudstone-soil mixture embankment slope stability due to rainfall infiltration are discussed. The initiation and formation mechanism of landslide are researched and the trends of development of the slope stability are also evaluated. The field monitoring results and numerical analysis both show that the deformed zone of mudstone-soil mixture landslides caused by rainfall infiltration lies under the slope, and the maximum deformation value appears on the slope surface. The crack makes the rainfall easily get into the deep soil layer, and thus a retaining water layer under slope surface will emerge. The layer causes the increase of the pore water pressure and the decrease of the effective stress together with the disintegrative and suction softening of mudstone. The decrease of strength has great effect on factor of safety (FOS) of the embankment slope stability.

After being forged and carried out by different heat treatment methods, their microstructures were observed by optical microscopy and SEM. The results showed that by the addition of cerium the static recrystallization of the steel was depressed, and the recrystallization temperature was promoted. Furthermore, the grain size was reduced, and the average grain diameter was changed from 50 μm to 19 μm, and the smaller size and the dispersed carbides were acquired. The mechanism might be that the dissolved Ce had drag effects on grain boundary and decreased its migration velocity, which had impact on the static recrystallization behavior of the tested steels. The carbides tended to deposit at grain boundary, and the grain refining led to the increase in grain boundary, which made carbides smaller and dispersed. © 1994-2009 China Academic Journal Electronic Publishing House.

67649234787	Improved particle swarm optimization for elastoplastic back analysis in geotechnical engineering	In order to offset the disadvantages of low searching efficiency and large amount of calculation using traditional PSO for elastoplastic back analysis in geotechnical engineering, the comparison method of fitness value and the motion mode of individual particle of traditional PSO are analyzed and the internal factors which restrict searching efficiency pointed out. Then some corresponding improvement measures are proposed. On this basis, an improved PSO (IPSO) is put forward and used for elastoplastic parameters inverse. The results show that, compared with traditional PSO, the parameter searching efficiency and the convergence precision of IPSO have an obvious increase and the inverse results meeting accuracy requirements can be obtained with less number of iterations. Thus the calculation amount for elastplastic back analysis can be greatly reduced if using IPSO. So our proposed algorithm is a feasible method for elastoplastic back analysis in geotechnical engineering.

69249225575	Ground penetrating radar electromagnetic waves simulation of pavement model with pavement material's inhomogeneous dielectric parameter	According to random distribution characteristics of practical pavement particles and scattering of dispersed particles on electromagnetic wave, the one-dimension finite difference time domain (1D-FDTD) equations of ground penetrating radar (GPR) electromagnetic wave, which propagates in half-space, are briefly established. And the electromagnetic wave of the air-coupled antenna GPR which propagates in asphalt pavement with surface material's homogeneous or inhomogeneous dielectric parameter are all forward simulated. Then the comparisons between the two models simulation waves and actual measurement wave are analyzed. It is concluded that the first model with the surface material's dielectric parameter selected on random can inosculate the actual measurement wave and well correspond to the reality. The research is helpful for GPR backward simulation as measuring thickness and other applications.

70350158562	Austenite grain growth behavior of Nb-V alloying non-quenched and tempered steel	The austenite grain growth behavior under different heating temperatures and holding time was studied for new type Nb-V alloying non-quenched and tempered steel, and comparison was made with 35MnVN non-quenched and tempered steel. With discussing the presence stale and effect mechanism of micro-alloying element Nb, V, a reasonable heating process was brought up. The test results show that Nb and V elements in austenite precipitate in form of NbC and VN phases in the Nb-V steel at 1280 °C and 1140 °C. The austenite grain growth temperature of the Nb-V alloying steel is practically defined as about 1150 °C according to ASTM grain size grade G = 5. 0, which is 50 °C higher than that of 35MnVN steel. The results show that the Nb-V non-quenched and tempered steel has good anti-coarsening ability at elevated temperature. Consequently, the reasonable heating temperature is 1150 °C - 1200 °C , and holding time is 30 ∼ 60 min before forging.

70749138410	Continuous cooling transformation of Nb-V microalloyed medium carbon non-quenched and tempered steels	The continuous cooling transformation (CCT) curves of Nb-V alloyed medium carbon non-quenched and tempered steels were measured by using Formastor-digital thermal dilatometer. Hardness of the tested steels under different cooling rates was measured, and the effect of Nb and V contents on continuous cooling transformation of the tested steels was investigated. The experimental results show that the phase transformation temperatures are decreased, the transformation regions of pearlite and bainite broaden and the volume fraction of the corresponding transformed product increase with increasing of Nb and V contents in the steel. Microstructure of ferrite and pearlite can be obtained with a cooling rate from 0.08°C/s to 1°C/s. When the cooling rate is higher than 2.5°C/s, bainite transformation occurs, more bainite microstructure can be obtained with increasing of cooling rate. In addition, martensite is observed in the steel when cooling rate is 5°C/s. Micro-hardness of the tested steels increases with increasing of cooling rate. Micro-hardness of the steel increases apparently for cooling rate at 10°C/s and 30°C/s.

0035364914	Microstructural features during strain induced ferrite transformation in 08 and 20Mn steels	The microstructure evolution during strain induced ferrite transformation was followed in thermal-simulation tests of clean 08 and 20Mn steels. The influences of carbon equivalence and initial austenite grain size on ferrite grain refinement and the volume fraction of ferrite during straining were inspected. The results revealed that the accelerating effect of ferrite transformation by strain was increased as the carbon equivalence decreased. However, finer ferrite grains were obtained at higher carbon content. At strain of ∼ 1.5 ferrite grains less than 3 μm and 2 μm can be obtained in 08 and 20Mn steels respectively. Whereas the ferrite grain refinement in 08 steel was due to both effects of strain induced transformation and ferrite dynamic recrystallization, that in 20Mn was mainly due to strain induced transformation. Heavy strain can produce fine ferrite grains in coarse austenite grained 08 steel, but it would lead to band microstructure in coarse austenite grained 20Mn.

Based on this method, the 3D-microstructure of 9SMn28 free-cutting steel was simulated in solidification processes and the simulation results are consistent with the experimental ones. In addition, the effects of Gaussian distribution parameters were also studied. The simulation results show that the higher the mean undercooling, the larger the columnar dendrite zones, and the larger the maximum nucleation density, the smaller the size of grains. The larger the standard deviation, the less the number of minimum grains is.

Calculation of kinetics of the dendrite tip growth is done according to the model of KGT. The crystallographic orientation <100> is selected preferentially, and the competition of crystal growth is developed directly. The coupling of FE and CA is realized through the interpolation between FE mesh and CA cells. Based on the CAFE method, 3D-microstructure of 9SMn28 free cutting steel was simulated in solidification processes, and the simulation results are consistent with those of experiment. The composition of 9SMn28 free cutting steel was optimized; the optimum C, P, Mn, Si and S contents are 0. 15%, 0.10%, 1.2%, 0.08% and 0.36%, respectively.

At the same time, the additional sequence of SiMg and Al was changed in the experiments. The contents of dissolved and total oxygen and residual magnesium were measured and change of inclusions in molten iron over time was investigated. The results indicate that the limit of deoxidization by the combination of 0.02% (mass fraction) SiMg and 0.03% (mass fraction) Al is comparable with 0.05wt% SiMg only and the yield of Mg in the molten iron treated by the combination is improved greatly at 1873 K.

And the microstructure obtained at different cooling rates was analyzed. The room temperature tensile strength and the impact energy of the tested steels were measured and the fractography was observed using SEM. The results show that the ferrite contents increase and the intragranular ferrite phase is easily formed with the increase of amount of As in 45 steel. The addition of As shortens the incubation period of bainite transformation and makes the CCT curve of 45 steel shift to left. At the same time, Ms point is decreased by increasing the As content. When the As content is less than 0. 25%, arsenic has no significant effect on the strength and toughness of 45 steel.

The simulation results are consistent with experimental findings; the simulated crystallisation process conforms to the actual situation. The solidification of 9SMn28 alloy is a volume solidification mode under slow cooling condition. The columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) is also studied in the CAFE model.

The simulation results were analyzed by use of thermodynamics, and carbon and phosphor contents were optimized. The results show that when the carbon content in this steel is from 0.09 wt% to 0.16 wt%, the higher the carbon content is, the smaller the columnar dendrite is, and the grain size decreases with increasing the carbon content at 0.09 wt%-0.15 wt%. When the phosphor content is from 0.02 wt% to 0.10 wt%, the sizes of the columnar dendrites and grains decrease with the increase of phosphor content.

The casting of 9SMn28 alloy is a stepwise solidification mode under water cooling condition. Convection is mainly made of buoyancy-driven flows and feeding flows in perpendicular direction of the solid-liquid interface. Convection is the reason of shaggy on free surface; it can decrease pipe shrinkage and columnar grain zone. Flow field plays an importance role in even temperature field and irregulation porosity morphology. The simulated result of pipe shrinkage is consistent with that of this experiment; the simulated result of porosity is identical with that of this experiment basically. © 2010 ISIJ.

The stress-strain curves of the steels were tested at different temperatures with different interval time between passes on a Gleeble-3800 thermo-mechanical simulator by double-hit hot compression method, and the rates of recrystallization were calculated according to the tested stress-strain curves. Microstructure of the steels annealed at different temperatures was observed by optical microscope. The results show that static-recrystallization behavior is depressed, the temperature of static-recrystallization is enhanced and thus grain size refined for the steel with addition of cerium. The value of static-recrystallization activation energy is raised from 103 kJ/mol to 114 kJ/mol for the steel with 0.028wt% of cerium. The migration velocity of grain boundary decreases as the result of the segregation of cerium on grain boundary, leading the depression of static-recrystallization process in the low chromium ferritic stainless steel.

As the radar performance reasons, the required fundamental frequency of radar tower should not be less than 1Hz. For such a tall building, how to control the frequency of radar tower is an issue worth studying. Through a lot of calculations and analyses, paper reaches a number of laws to increase frequency: 1) Lowering center of gravity of the structure; 2) Setting leaning bracing; 3) Raising the thickness or number of shear walls. In the above structural frequencies adjustment methods, setting leaning bracing and reducing the top mass of the structure are the most obvious effects of all. At the same time, paper also discusses on the seismic response of radar tower. Analyses used for earthquake are response spectrum method, time history analysis method and random vibration analysis.

Arch bridge in the dead load and lane loads, the main arch axial force is in line with the general concept of arch bridge mechanical property. Leaning arch effect in the vault under the main arch, the largest axial force occurs. In the dead load and the live loads, the arch longitudinal and transverse stability coefficient is greater than 5, meeting the stability requirements. Dynamic characteristic analysis shows that relative to the longitudinal stiffness, transverse stiffness is weak, which in the design and construction should pay attention to the upper junction between the main arch and stable arch. Leaning arch bridge under the action of response spectrum, the main arch in the vertical excitation reaches the maximum axial force, whereas stable arch in the vertical and horizontal excitation is maximum.

When the shell is just out of the mold, the outer surface is in a compression state, while the front of solidification is in a completely tensile state. The effective strain increases from the outer surface to the front step by step. The liquid steel expands and its velocity decreases gradually in the progress.

79958862930	Effect of Nb on mechanical properties of 60Si2CrVAT spring steel	The orthogonal experiments of heat treatment were carried on 60Si2CrVAT spring steels with different Nb content and the mechanical properties were measured. Based on mechanical property analysis, the preferable heat treatment process were determined, which is austenized at 900°C for 35 min with oil cooling and tempered at 400°C for 60 min with water cooling. The influence of Nb content on the mechanical properties of the 60Si2CrVAT spring steel was investigated through analysis and comparison of the solid solubility of Nb and V in austenite, forged grain sizes and inclusions of the tested steels with different Nb content. The results show that the addition of 0.028% Nb in this steel can meet the mechanical property requirements and cost saving.

79958037285	Strengthening experiment of a hollow slab bridge by external transverse prestressing	For hollow slab bridge, its concrete hinge joint is prone to be damaged under overload vehicles, as weakens the transverse integrity of bridge, leads to single slab bearing and threatens the safety of service. Aiming at the problem, a strengthening experiment of an actual concrete hollow slab bridge, which has experienced a destructive test with its transverse connections seriously damaged, was performed by applying external transverse prestressing to it. The strengthening design and construction technology of external prestressing were introduced. By means of truck static load test, the variation of deflections and strains of the bridge before and after strengthening under different tension force was obtained, and the influence of tension value to strengthening effect was emphatically analyzed.

79959529154	Simulation of Secondary Dendritic Arm Spacing of Free Cutting Steel 38MnVS	The secondary dendritic arm spacing (SDAS) of free cutting steel 38MnVS during continuous casting process was simulated based on a Mixed Lagrangian and Eulerian Method (MiLE Method) and SDAS model. The simulation results are basically in agreement with measured ones. The effect of composition, superheat and casting speed on SDAS are studied, and the relationship between SDAS and interdendritic segregation is discussed. The results show that SDAS increases with increasing carbon and silicon content, and decreases with increasing manganese and sulfur content. The increase of superheat and casting speed also makes SDAS increase. The permeability of columnar mushy zone which is parallel to the primary dendritic arms is calculated based on Carman-Kozeny relationship, and the increase of SDAS makes the permeability increase, which exacerbates interdendritic segregation of columnar crystal zone. © 2011 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute.

80052823873	Destructive test study of a prestressed concrete hollow slab beam bridge	Actual bridge destructive tests are of great significance to investigate the mechanical behavior and failure mechanism of existing bridges under ultimate loads. However, the field destructive experiments were seldom carried out up to now due to the limitations of test opportunities, cost and difficulties. In this research, a prestressed concrete hollow slab beam bridge, East Meng Jiang Nu Bridge, was used for full-scaled destructive test, which would soon be dismantled owing to the relocation of expressway. The test scheme, including loading method and instruments arrangement, was prescribed in detail, and the law of deflection change, strain variation and crack propagation of the bridge were systematically discussed, as well as the failure process and mode. The results showed that the actual bearing capacity of the bridge was much higher than the theoretical value, the failure of concrete hinge points was the major factor which led to the loss of structural integrity, and the guardrails had significant influence on the failure mode and bearing capacity of the bridge with its strengthening effects on superstructure. The study of this paper will provide technical reference for similar bridges in such aspects as maintenance and reinforcement, ultimate state research and load-carrying capacity assessment. © 2011 ASCE.

The distributions of stress field, displacement field and plastic zone of rock mass after excavation of tunnel were discussed considering coupled effect between flow and stress under the condition of different rock level and tunnel depth. Compared with the calculation results of not considering coupling effect, the maximum deformation, maximum principle stress and plastic zone size of wall rock were obviously increased when considering coupling effect, which showed a remarkable influence of coupled fluid-solid effect on the stability of tunnel surrounding rock.

The simulation results are basically in agreement with experimental data in the literature, achieving the three-dimensional visualization of temperature distribution, melt flow, shell thickness, and stress distribution of blooms in a mold. It is shown that the flow velocity of steel melt becomes smaller gradually as the casting proceeds. When the flow reaches a certain depth, two types of flow patterns can be observed in the upper zone of the mold. The first flow pattern is to flow downwards, and the second one is to flow upwards to the meniscus. The corner temperature is higher, and the thickness is thinner than those in the mid-face. The effective stress in the corner area is much bigger than that in the mid-face, indicating that the corner area is the dangerous zone of cracking. © 2011 University of Science and Technology Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The relations of the dendrite arm spacing and sulfides' average diameter to solidification conditions were established. Experimental results show that the average diameter of MnS inclusions decreases with increasing temperature gradient around the solid/liquid zone and casting speed, but the number of MnS inclusions increases. The complete precipitation temperature of MnS is about 100°C lower than the solidus temperature. The morphological changes of MnS are mainly effected by the activities of constituent elements, in other words, they are mainly influenced by interfacial energy. The relations of the dendrite arm spacing and sulfides' average diameter to solidification conditions were regressed, and the regression results are basically in agreement with the ones of previous researchers.

During its construction, it has speedy, economic, and practical characteristics and few influences on the dam. The polymer diaphragm wall has been successfully used in earth-rock dams. But at present the static and dynamic characteristics of earth-rock dams are seldom studied. The Duncan-Chang E-B nonlinear model is used and the contact element is set up between the diaphragm wall and the dam for the FEM model. A comparison of stresses on the diaphragm wall among polymer, plastic concrete and normal concrete under static and seismic loads shows that the stress on the polymer diaphragm wall is the least and it is not easy to be failed.

The objective is to study the influence of B2O3 on the viscosity and structure of mould slags containing low silica content. The research of the low silica slag system is meaningful because of it is less reactive with Al during continuous casting of steels containing high amounts of dissolved aluminium, such as transformation induced plasticity assisted steels. The viscosities of these quinternary slags decreased slightly with an increase in the content of additive B2O3 above the break temperature. The apparent activation energy of viscous flow was found to decrease with increasing B2O3 content. The break temperature also decreased with increasing B2O3 content. Based on the experimental data, the decrease in break temperature per mol.-% B2O3 DTbr is 15·23 K. An empirical model was then established to predict the break temperature of mould slags containing B2O3, and the deviation is between -25 and +25 K. Based on the viscosity and Fourier transform infrared analysis, it is proposed that the three-coordinated boron is dominated in these slags over the entire compositional range, and the borosilicate networks are loosened with increasing B2O3 content in the present study. The Riboud model was modified empirically based on the present experimental data, and the mean deviation is ∼13%. © 2014 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

84894621435	Dual lixiviant leaching process for extraction and recovery of gold from ores at room temperature	A comprehensive investigation of Au leaching from gold ores with a solution containing thiourea and ammonium thiocyanate was performed. A gold ore A with 18 g/t of Au and 1.15 wt.% of sulfur and another gold ore B with 55.7 g/t of Au and 11.67 wt.% of sulfur were used. The percentages of extracted Au were 57%, 66% and 95% for the leaching solutions containing thiourea only, ammonium thiocyanate only and ammonium thiocyanate plus thiourea, respectively, under optimal conditions. There were some interactions among thiourea, ammonium thiocyanate and ferric ion, which affected gold extraction greatly. The addition of thiocyanate reduced greatly the consumption of thiourea and the process cost accordingly. The optimal concentrations of thiourea, ammonium thiocyanate and ferric sulfate for ore A leaching were 0.13 M, 0.78 M and 0.028 M, respectively. The optimal pH, temperature, time, ratio of liquid to solid, agitation speed and particle size for ore A leaching were 1.5, 21 C, 6 h, 10, 250 rpm and 54-74 μm, respectively. Au extraction for ore A was 95% under above optimal conditions. Au extraction was 97% when sulfur content of ore B was 1.48 wt.%. The preferential consumption of ferric ions by pyrite over by gold was the main reason for resulting in the decrease of gold extraction. Desulfurization is necessary to achieve a high gold extraction for this leaching system of thiourea-thiocynate-Fe3 +. After Au extraction, about 90% of Au was recovered as insoluble metallic Au by cementation using 5 g/L of Al powder. The cementation filtrate was reused to leach Au ore and about 91% of Au was extracted after pH adjustment. Thus, thiocyanate and thiourea could be reused, which reduced the process cost. The leaching speed of Au of this method was more than 4 times faster than that of cyanidation process. This process concerning extraction and recovery of Au from Au ore was effective, fast, environmentally friendly and also likely economical. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The dynamic continuous cooling transformation (CCT) curves of four low-alloy structural steels with different contents of Cr were obtained by DSC analysis and dilatometric method combining with metallographic test and hardness measurement. The results show that with the increase of Cr content, the hardness of the steel greatly increases. Chromium may retard the pro-eutectoid ferrite formation of super-cooled austenite and broaden the transformation region of bainite. Compared to the original Q345 steel, the steel with the adjusted composition (C and Mn reduced and Cr added) may have a higher critical cooling velocity (0.5°C/s) of F+P, the two-phase structure formation. Therefore, a higher cooling rate may be applied in the actual process of steel making to improve productivity.

The change of stiffness of the track-subgrade system after the uplift process is investigated based on the fixed-point cyclic loading tests. The test results indicate that the stiffness of the track structures is slightly reduced after the uplift process, but the change of the natural vibration frequency of the track-subgrade system is very limited. The investigation on cumulative settlement and dynamic stiffness of the uplifted track structures under very large cycles of simulated train moving loads shows that the uplifted track has satisfactory dynamic stability.

84900478256	Solidification process and sulfide precipitation behavior in free-cutting non-quenched and tempered steel	Phase diagram and sulfide precipitation behavior of YF45MnV steel were investigated by simulation using Thermo-Calc thermodynamic software combined with the related TCFE6 database, and the effects of segregation of C, Si, Al, Mn and S on sulfide precipitation in the steel were studied. The Scheil-Gulliver solidification model was implemented to predict the solidification mode and the segregation behavior of various elements in the solidification process. The results show that the initial precipitation temperature of MnS decreases with increasing of C, Si, Al content and decreasing of Mn and S content. The calculated equilibrium distribution coefficients of Mn and S are 0.70 and 0.02, respectively. With the concentration of Mn and S enriched in remaining liquid, MnS precipitates at the end of solidification process. Also, the increase in S concentration would obviously enlarge the precipitated MnS, which distributes along the grain boundaries.

84902515212	Bainite formation control of 12Cr2Mo1R steel heavy plate in normalizing process	Bainite formation in the normalizing process of 12Cr2Mo1R steel heavy plate center was investigated by the application of static CCT curve and finite-element numerical simulation method. The minimum cooling rate (i. e. critical cooling rate) to gain bainite was determined by the CCT curve and metallographic microstructure observation. Furthermore, numerical simulation method was employed to investigate center cooling characteristic of the heavy plate with thickness of 60 mm to 200 mm as it was impossible to measure the temperature of plate center, which provided the basis to adjust cooling rate for obtaining bainite. The results show that the critical cooling rate for gaining bainite is approximately 1°C/s, and there exists a exponential relationship between surface cooling intensity and center cooling rate. Meanwhile, for 12Cr2Mo1R steel heavy plate, the thickness should be limited to approximate 180 mm in order to gain complete bainite microstructure.

84901857824	Dynamic continuous cooling transformation of EQ70 steel for offshore platform	Dynamic continuous cooling transformation curves of EQ70 steel for offshore platform were measured based on Gleeble-1500 thermal mechanical simulator coupling with microstructure observation and Vickers hardness measurement. The results show that the microstructure with granular bainite and small amount of ferrite is obtained at the cooling rate of 0.05°C/s. Microstructure mainly consists of granular bainite and lath bainite when the cooling rate ranges between 0.1°C/s and 1°C/s. Martensite begins to appear as the cooling rate is 2°C/s, the volume fraction of martensite increases with the cooling rate increasing, when cooling rate is up to 8°C/s, the microstructure is completely martensite.

84903704657	Numerical simulation of macrosegregation in water-cooled heavy flat ingot during solidification	Based on a volume-averaged two-phase approach, a coupled concentration, temperature, and velocity fields model has been established to predict the formation of macrosegregation during solidification. Because of the significant influence of velocity field on solute transfer and distribution during solidification process, the density of liquid steel was set as a function of temperature and concentration to accurately calculate the velocity field. Therefore, the influence of gravity, temperature gradient, concentration gradient, and volume shrinkage on velocity field distribution was comprehensively considered. The calculation result showed good agreement with previous reports. Thereafter, the current model was applied to simulate the solidification of 12Cr2Mo1R (ASTM standard 2.25Cr1Mo) heavy ingot, and the influence of surface cooling intensity on the final carbon macrosegregation was investigated. The results showed that with the increase of cooling intensity, the solidification time, flow velocity, and mushy zone width decrease, and as a result, macrosegregation is alleviated. When the heat-transfer coefficient is less than 1000 W m

84904500351	Microstructure and impact properties of CGHAZ in low-alloy structural steel containing Cr	Based on the chemical composition of Q345 steel, the tested steel with different Cr contents (0.36%, 0.55% and 0.70%, mass fraction) was designed and made. Effect of Cr content on the CGHAZ of the low alloy structural steel was studied by the method of thermal simulation. The results show that the microstructure of the steel is bainite after thermal simulation. The grain is coarsened dramatically, and the finer and longer lath bainite formed directionally in the specimen with 0.70% Cr, that make the toughness of the steel worse. With Cr content increasing, the impact absorbing energy decreases, and both the percentage of crystallinity of fracture and the hardness increases. In considerationof of welding performance, the content of Cr should be controlled in about 0.55%.

84905028744	Identification of surrounding rock parameters based on MSVR	An inversion method based on multi-output support vector regression (MSVR) is proposed for identifying the mechanical parameters of surrounding rock. This method considers the surrounding rock as a multi-output system during excavation, and the surveyed rock deformations of each monitoring section as its output. First, perform numerical experiments based on the principle of orthogonal test to obtain the calculated deformation values corresponding to different rock parameter combinations, and use them as the samples for training the model of MSVR as reflecting the nonlinear mapping relationship between rock and its deformations. Second, use the PSO to seek the optimal rock parameters based on measured deformations of rock mass. An example is employed to test the presented inversion method. The results showed that compared with the inversion method based on single-output support vector regression (SSVR), the proposed one is more inclined to reach the global optimization goals and achieve more reliable inversion results due to its consideration of the inherent correlativity among the measured deformations of each monitoring section. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84906954007	Dynamic continuous cooling transformation of Nb microalloyed high strength low alloy wear-resistant steel NM500	The dynamic continuous cooling transformation (CCT) curve of Nb microalloyed steel based on NM500 steel with different cooling rates was investigated. Dynamic CCT test was operated on Gleeble-1500 thermal simulation testing machine through controlling deformation and cooling rate. The results show that, with the Nb content increasing from 0.018% to 0.059%, hardness of test steel increases and the cooling rate for bainite transformation starting and finishing increases, which enlarge the ranges of operational parameters; when the cooling rate reaches 5-8 ℃/s, the proportion of martensite and bainite is moderate, which guarantee the strength and hardness of the test steel meet the NM500 requirements.

0942288289	A Reliability Analysis Method of Offshore Platforms	The structures of offshore platforms are usually very important and complicated system, the surroundings around which is always execrable, so the reliability analysis of them has important significance. In the reliability analysis of large structures, the method FOMN has higher accuracy and is used widely. But the first order second moment method is required to calculate the reliability index repeatedly, thus the amount of calculation is large and convergence could not be guaranteed. A new reliability analysis method suitable for offshore platforms is presented in this article in which the first order second moment method is not involved and convergence problem is overcome. Because of the simplicity, high efficiency and accuracy, this method has very bright for the reliability analysis of large and complicated structural system.
