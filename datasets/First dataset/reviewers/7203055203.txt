1542286043	Evaluation of severe brain impairment	Objective: To investigate the methods for evaluating severe brain impairment accurately and objectively. Methods: Using clinical examinations (including conscious state, Glasgow coma score, brain stem reflections, cranial nerve dominated actions, spinal reflections, spinal nerve dominated automatic actions, respiratory and respiratory machine testing) and laboratory methods (such as EEG, BEAP, SLSEP and TCD), 21 cases with severe brain impairment were evaluated. Results: The main causes of severe brain impairment were respiratory and cardiac arrest, acute hypoxemia and hypotension. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was determined according to the standard issued by the National Severe Emergency Medicine Congress in 1995. 7 cases were determined as brain death presenting with deep coma, disappearance of brain stem reflection and cranial nerve dominated automatic action; spinal reflection completely disappearance in 5 patients and partially in 2 patients, spinal auto-reflection existed in 1 patient, and spinal nerve dominated automatic action disappeared. All clinical evaluations of brain marker and at least 3 laboratory marker were accorded with the determinant standard of brain death. All hearts stopped beating in 1 ∼ 18 days after evaluation. 7 cases were evaluated as remaining in a vegetation state, the clinical presentation including open-eyes coma, partially impaired the brain stem reflection (3 cases) and the cranial nerve dominated action (6 cases), and partially affected the spinal reflection and the spinal nerve dominated auto-action completely disappeared in all 7 patients. All of the presentation and electraphysiological evaluation anastomosed roughly, hemisphere function of 86% cases were impaired (EEG I grade), brainstem function of all cases were impaired, and BAEP showing lateral bilateral V-wave disappear. Among the remaining 7 cases, 5 cases were determined as death by GOS. The brain stem reflection and cranial nerve dominated action disappeared in most of the patients, pressing-orbit reaction disappeared in 3 patients, no auto-respiratory in 1 case, decerebrate rigidity in 1 case, and spinal nerve dominated action disappeared in 4 cases. 2 EEGs showed I grade, BAEP and SLSEP showed I grade or II grade, and prognoses were all right, then. 5 cases died because the results of clinical and electrophysiological evaluation were bad. Conclusions: The combination and continuous observation of clinical and laboratory index might improve the accuracy of evaluation.

18844421833	Hemodynamics of cerebral venous thrombosis	Objective: To observe the changes of hemodynamics in cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). Methods: Having aquired the normal flow velocities of basal vein of rosenthal (BVR) and deep middle cerebral vein (DMCV), we had a prospective study on hemodynamics of the same veins of 3 groups of patients. There were altogether 51 cases, the first group contained 33 cases with CVT, moreover, 12 patients receiving thrombolytic therapy among them were monitored. The second group contained 11 cases with intracranial hypertension without CVT. The third group contained 6 cases with cerebrovenous malformation without CVT. All of the three groups were detected by MRI, and the diagnosis were proved by DSA or MRV. We chose the venous (BVR or DMCV) maximum average flow velocity (Vmax) of each case as to managing data Results: In the first group , the Vmax of BVR and DMCV were (64.6 ± 22.9) cm/s and (70.7 ± 28.6) cm/s respectively, they were higher than normal values (P < 0.01) and were not affected by intracranial pressure (r = 0.06, P > 0.05), and the Vmax of the same veins in patients with thrombolytic therapy was reduced obviously (P < 0.01). In the second group, the Vmax of BVR and DMCV were (11.4 ± 2.7) cm/s and (10.2 ± 2.8) cm/s respectively, shown in a range of normal values (P > 0.05), and were also not affected by intracranial pressure (r = 0.053, P > 0.05). In the third group, the Vmax of BVR and DMCV were (12.0 ± 4.6) cm/s and (11.1 ± 6.8) cm/s respectively, all were in a range of normal value (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The study of cerebrovenous hymodynamics found that the compensatory increase of the flow velocities of BVR and DMCV was the characteristics of CVT, and would not be affected by intracranial pressure and cerebrovenous malformation, which might provide a reliable, noninvasive and low-priced detecting method for earlier diagnosis, monitoring and evaluating the curative effects of CVT.

27844471039	Primary study on imaging in transient ischemic attacks	Background: Although transient ischemic attacks (TIA) is a clinical diagnosis, imaging findings are important for its diagnosis and treatment. This study evaluated the value and limitations of conventional CT, CT cerebral perfusion imaging and transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) in patients with TIA. Methods: Conventional CT, CT cerebral perfusion imaging and TCD were performed in 20 patients with TIA. After regular CT examination, 40-second dynamic scans were performed on selected slice, while 40 ml of non-ionic contrast materials was bolus-injected through antecubital vein with power injector. These dynamic images were processed with the perfusion software package on workstation. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and time to peak (TTP) were measured in specific regions of the brain. TCD was also performed in 20 patients with TIA. Comparative analysis was made on the basis of the results of conventional CT, CT cerebral perfusion imaging and TCD. Results: In the 20 patients with TIA, conventional CT turned out to be normal. However, persisting abnormal perfusion changes corresponding to clinical symptoms were found in 13 cases with the prolonged TTP. The other 7 cases were normal. TTP of the affected side (11.6 ± 3.0)s was significantly prolonged (t = 4.782,P <0.01) in comparison with the contralateral side (8.8 ± 1.5)s. The difference in CBF was not statistically significant (t = 1.912, P=0.073) between the affected side [(223.9 ± 19.6) ml · min

Methods: This study group includes 112 patients with extracranial segments of internal carotid arterial occlusion in one side and the other side normal or stenosis less than 50%, and 112 control patients without cerebrovascular disease and both extracranial and intracranial segment of internal carotid arteries were normal by color Doppler flow imaging. The peak systolic velocity (PSV) and pulsatility index (PI) of the bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA), anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) were measured, the difference of PSV and PI of bilateral MCA, ACA, PCA in the occlusion group and control group were compared respectively. The PSV difference (PSVD) and PI difference (PID) of the occluded side were counted. Results: The PSV D and PID of bilateral MCA in occlusion group were significantly higher than control group (PSVD 61 cm/s, P=0.000; PID > 70%, P=0.000). There was obviously asymmetry between bilateral MCA, ACA, and PCA in occlusion group. The PSV and PI of MCA and ACA in the occluded side were significantly lower than the normal side (P=0.000). The PSV of PCA in the occuded side was significantly higher and the PI was significantly lower than normal side (P=0.000 respectively). PSV of MCA in the occluded side correlated with bilateral ACA and PCA (P=0.000, P=0.000, P=0.006 respectively). Conclusion: Aggregate analysis of PSV and PI, and PSVD and PID in bilateral MCA by TCD will increase recognition of abnormal hemodynamic in the patients with unilateral internal carotid occlusion.

33745452109	Detection by ultrasonography for coronary artery stenosis and intra - Extracranial arteriosclerosis	Objective: To analyze the relationship between coronary artery stenotic lesion and intracranial/extracranial arteriosclerotic stenosis. Methods: A total of 213 patients, with coronary artery stenosis (≥ 70%) were confirmed by angiography, and going to have coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were divided into group A (n=42; stenotic arteries ≤2 branches) and group B (n=171; stenotic arteries ≥ 3 branches). The patients' carotid arteries and intracranial/extracranial arteries were examined respectively by using color duplex flow imaging (CDFI) and transcranial Doppler (TCD). The occurrence of extracranial/intracranial artery stenotic lesions in the two groups was compared. Results: The detectable rate of intracranial artery stenotic lesions in the group B 59.6% (102/171) was higher than the group A 42.9% (18/42), P=0.008. The incidence of carotid stenosis (≥50%) in the group B 55.6% (95/171) was higher than in the group A 33.3% (14/42) (P=0.01). The incidence of carotid stenosis (≥50% with multiple intracranial vascular stenosis in the group B was significantly higher than in the group A (P=0.000), and they were 49.7% (85/171) and 16.7% (7/42), respectively (P=0.000). Conclusion: With the aggravation of coronary sclerosis, the extracranial/intracranial artery stenostic lesions will be aggravated gradually. The combination of CAS and CABG may detect intracranial/ extracranial stenosis in time in patients who have been diagnosed as coronary atherosclerosis.

33749334142	Clinical study of the distribution of atherosclerosis in the patients with ischemic stroke	Objective: To study the relationship between the clinical subtypes of acute ischemic stroke and the distribution of carotid atherosclerosis. Methods: The extent of intra- and extra- cranial atherosclerosis were detected with transcranial Doppler (TCD) and color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI). Comprehensive analysis was performed on medical history, laboratory examination and lesion site in the brain indicated by radiological imaging. Results: Among 411 patients with acute ischemic stroke, 160 cases (38.93%) suffered with intracranial artery stenosis, and 99 cases (24.09%) with extracranial carotid artery stenosis. Compared with patients without carotid stenosis, those with stenosis were often seen in elder patients (P=0.020) and smokers (P=0.013), while the morbidity of diabetes was significantly higher in intracranial artery stenosis patients than those without stenosis (P=0.005). In this group, 49 patients had cortical infarction, 108 had subcortical infarction, 72 had lacunar infarction and 30 had transient ischemic attack. Cortical infarction presented more frequently in patients with extracranial carotid artery stenosis (P=0.001), and media-intima thickness was more significant (P=0.020), whereas lacunar infarction presented more frequently in patients with intracranial artery stenosis (P=0.016). Between the patients with extracranial artery stenosis and intracranial artery stenosis, the indexes such as age, sex, plasma glucose and blood lipid showed no statistical difference (P>0.05, for all). Conclusion: The patterns of acute ischemic stroke determined by clinical and radiological examination is related to the location of intra- and extra- cranial atherosclerosis, which would suggest their different underlying pathogenesis. Diabetes and smoking is the major causes of extra- and intracranial artery diseases.

33845935465	The evaluation of therapeutic effect of stenting on vertebral artery origin stenosis with color Doppler ultrasound	Objective: To evaluate the changes of inner diameters and hemodynamics in patients with vertebral artery origin stenosis before and after stenting with color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI). Methods: Seventy-eight vertebral arteries in 39 patients were detected with CDFI, among them 41 stents were placed in patients with vertebral artery origin stenosis (≥50%). The parameters including the inner diameter of vertebral artery and its original part before and after stenting, the peak systolic velocity (PSV) and the pulsatile index (PI) at vertebral artery origin and intervertebral segments were documented. The rate of stenosis at vertebral artery origin was evaluated synthetically, and the possible risk factors (age, hypertention, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hyperlipemia, and smoking) that might result in restenosis were conducted with logistic regression analysis. The mean follow-up time was 11 ± 8 months. Results: The internal diameters of vertebral artery origin before and after stenting were 1.3 ± 0.4 mm and 2.7 ± 0.7 mm, respectively (P = 0.000). The rate of stenosis decreased from 64 ± 9% to 23 ± 17% (P= 0.000). The abnormal high flow rate of PVS decreased from 242 ± 102 cm/ s before the stenting to 87 ± 45 cm/s after the stenting (P =0.000). The PI (0.77 ± 0.19) at the affected sides of vertebral artery origin before the stenting were significantly lower than the unaffected sides (0.96 ± 0.17, P = 0.011); and in comparison with the both sides, there were no significant difference between them in PI after the stenting (P = 0.494). The incidence of restenosis in the stents was 29.3% (12/41) during the follow-up period. It showed that the levels of PSV were equal or higher than those before stenting. Restenosis were common in patients with hyperlipemia after stenting (OR = 5.7, 95% CI, 1.2 to 25.9), R = 1.740 (P = 0.024). Conclusion: CDFI may be used as an important means for objective evaluation of the vertebral artery origin stenosis and the changes of hemodynamics before and after stenting and for long-term follow-up study. Hyperlipemia may be an important risk factor for restenosis after vertebral artery stenting.

Methods: In the prospective case-control study, 193 patients with cerebral infarction in internal artery system within 2 weeks were used as cerebral infarction group, and 103 normal healthy subjects were used as control group. Griess diazotization assay and enzyme-labelled immunosorbent assay were used for measuring the concenration of NO product and NOS activity in both groups; the breath-holding index (BHI) was obtained by transcranial Doppler combined with breath-holding test to evaluate CVR. Results: BHIs in the cerebral infarction and control groups were 1.0 ± 0.4 and 1.4 ± 0.5, respectively; the median concentration of NO product was 6.04 (3.83 - 11.49) μmol/L and 6.89 (4.64 - 12.43) μmol/L, respectively; NOS activity was 3.0 ± 1.5 U/mL and 3.2 ± 1.5 U/mL, respectively. BHI and the cocentration of NO production in the cerebral infartion group were lower than those in the control group (all P < 0.05 ). BHI showed positive correlation with NO production (r = 0.39, P = 0.000), and there was no correlation with NOS. There was no NOS activity difference between the two groups (P = 0.517). Conclusions: There were certain correlations between the decrease of CVR in patients with cerebral infarction and the reduction of NO content, however, the relations between CVR and NOS activity remained uncertain. NO may be one of the factors in regulating CVR.

36749057412	Application of hyperventilation index for assessing cerebrovascular reactivity	Objective: To investigate the application of hyperventilation index (HVI) for assessing the feasibility of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in the hyperventilation test. Methods: Thirty-seven healthy persons were selected by using a self-paired design. Before and after breath-holding test and hyperventilation test, the mean flow velocity of bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) were monitored by TCD. When breath-holding time and hyperventilation time were 10-30 seconds, breath-holding index (BHI) and hyperventilation ratio of reduction in velocity(HVR) were calculated. The calculation formula of HVI was established as HVI = ([rest mean flow velocity-mean flow velocity after ventilation]/rest mean flow velocity) × 100/ventilation time. By using BHI as a standard to assess the feasibility of HVI for reflection of CVR. Results: The duration of hyperventilation was within 30 seconds. The chages of MCA blood-flow velocity was reduced linearly with the prolonged time, and they entered to a plateau phase after 30 seconds. The HVI was 1.48 ± 0.24 and the BHI was 1.47 ± 0.27, These was no statistical significance difference (P = 0.84) but had a positive correlation between them (r = 0.72,P = 0.00). The regression equation was Y(BHI) = 0.000 + 0.984X(HVI). The HVR was 30.3 ± 5.5%, it had a correlation with HVI (r = 0.536, P = 0.00), but had no correlation with BHI (r = 0.07, P = 0.34). Conclusion: The hyperventilation time and breath-holding time are 10-30 s. The use of HVI and BHI as indicators for assessing CVR has the same clinical significance.

35649010450	Ultrasound analysis of the relationship between the variation of vertebral artery running and the onset of vertigo	Objective: To analyze the relationship between the anatomical variation of intervertebral segment of vertebral artery (the artery do not get into skull via C-6 transverse foramen) and the onset of vertigo. Methods: Fifty-four patients with vertigo were selected as vertigo group, and 56 healthy person without history of cardiocerebrovascular diseases and vertigo were selected as control group. The types of variation of the intervertebral segment of vertebral artery and the peak systolic velocity (PSV) were detected by color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI), and the PVS of intracranial segment of the vertebral artery was detected by TCD. The effect of running variation on the PVS of intracranial and extravertebral arteries and their relationship with the onset of vertigo were analyzed. Results: The incidences of the variation of vertebral artery running in the vertigo and control groups were 83% (45/54) and 21.4% (12/56), respectively (P = 0.001). There were 57 patients with variation of vertebral artery running altogether in both groups, and the patients with bilateral variation were more likely to develop vertigo than those with unilateral variation (P = 0.021); There was no statistical significance between the high (higher than C3) or low position of variations of the vertebral artery running and the incidence of vertigo (P = 1.000). The PSVs of intervertebral segment of vertebral artery and intracranial segment in patients with running variation were 56 ± 10 and 53 ± 10 cm/s respectively, and in patients with normal vertebral artery running were 59 ± 12 and 56 ± 11 cm/s, respectively. There were statistical differences between the PSVs of intervertebral and intracranial segments in patients with running variation and normal vertebral artery (P = 0.047 and 0.041, respectively); and the PSV in patients with running variation in intracranial segment of vertebral artery was lower than that in intervertebral segment, and there were significant differences between them (P = 0.038). Conclusion: The combined detection with CDFI with TCD can objectively analyze the variation of the vertebral artery running, and this variation may be the cause leading to vertigo.

38749083402	Restenosis in patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery stenosis after stenting: An analysis of influencing factors	Objective: To investigate the influencing factors of restenosis in patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis after stenting. Methods: The clinical data of 113 patients with symptomatic MCA stenosis who had stenting were analyzed retrospectively. The restenosis rate after stenting was followed-up with transcranial Doppler (TCD) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The standard of criterion of stenotic degree referred to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET). The degree of MCA stenosis > 50% after stenting was defined as restenosis. They were divided into <5 mm, 5-10 mm and > 10 mm according to the length of MCA stenosis; and they were divided into bare stents and drug-eluting stents according to the type of stent. The length of MCA stenosis, type of stent, risk factors and their correlations with restenosis were analyzed. The significant differences for the restenosis rate with and without related risk factors were examined by chi-square test. Results: There were 161 stenosis in 113 patients, and 129 stents were placed in these patients. The mean stenosis rate of the MCAs before the procedure was 80.8 ± 8.8%; and immediately after the procedure was 3.7 ± 8.2%. A total of 89 patients (78.8%) were followed-up, and their mean follow-up time was 3 months to 5 years (28.7 ± 16.4). Sixty-three patients were followed-up with TCD, and 26 with angiography. Sixteen patients (16/89, 17.9%) had restenosis of less than 50%, of which the length of lesion was < 5 mm in 4 patients (4/39, 10.2%), 5-10 mm in 11 patients (11/47, 23.4%), and >10 mm in 1 patient (1/3). Fifteen patients (15/80, 18.8%) had restenosis after the bare stent placement, and 1 patient (1/9) had restenosis after the drug eluting stent placement. Of the 16 restenosis patients, 11 had diabetes, 10 had hypertension, 6 had hyperlipoidemia, 4 had both diabetes and hypertension, 9 were smokers, 5 were drinkers, and 2 had coronary heart disease. There was no significant difference in the restenosis rate with and without related risk factors (P all > 0.05). Conclusion: Stent placement for the treatment of MCA stenosis is safe and effective. The cause of restenosis after stenting may be associated with the type of stent, and the risk factors of diabetes can't be excluded. They remain to be further studied.

77954199995	The diagnostic accuracy of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography for middle cerebral artery stenosis	Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracies of the different hemodynamic parameters of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) for mild (< 50%), moderate (50-69%), and severe (70-99%) stenosis of middle cerebral artery (MCA). Methods: 523 MCA in 298 consecutive patients (73 occluded MCA were excluded) were clinically suspected of having MCA stenosis. TCD examination was performed, the systolic peak velocity (PSVst, PSVpro, PSVpro) of the stenotic segments of MCA and the proximal and distal segments of the stenosis, as well as the mean flow velocity (MFVst) of the stenotic segments were recorded. The PSVst/PSVpro and PSVst/PSVpro were calculated. Taking the DSA results as the standard, the optimal parameter for diagnosing different degrees of MCA stenosis were determine by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve), and the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive, and negative predictive value for diagnosing MCA stenosis with different parameters were analyzed. Results: Circled digit one Of the 523 MCA showed by DSA, the normal, mild, moderate, and severe stenosis were 168, 61, 71, and 223, respectively. Circled digit two When taking 140 cm/s ≤PSVst <180 cm/s and 90 cm/s ≤MFVst <120 cm/s as the boundary values of diagnosing mild MCA stenosis, the accuracies were the highest, and they were 87.3% (200/229 branches) and 84.7% (194/229 branches) respectively. Digit circled three When taking 180 cm/s ≤ PSVst <220 cm/s, 120 cm/s ≤MFVst <150 cm/s, 2.0 ≤PSVst/PSVpro <3.0, and 1.8 ≤PSVst/PSVpro <2.0 as the diagnostic boundary values of diagnosing moderate MCA stenosis, the accuracies were the highest, and they were 89.0% (267/300 branches), 87.7% (263/300 branches), 87.7% (263/300 branches), and 85.7% (253/300 branches), respectively. Circled digit four When taking PSVst ≥ 220 cm/s, MFVst ≥150 cm/s, PSVst/PSVpro ≥3.0, and PSVst/PSVpro ≥2.0 as the diagnostic boundary values of diagnosing severe MCA stenosis, the accuracies were highest, and they were 88.0% (460/523 branches), 87.4% (457/523 branches), 88.9% (465/523 branches), and 83.9% (439/523 branches), respectively. As compared to the above parameters, the diagnosis of severe MCA stenosis in combination of PSVst ≥220 cm/s and PSVst/PSVpro ≥3.0 could increase the specificity of diagnosis (92.3%). Conclusions: Take the DSA findings as the standard, the accuracies of diagnosing different degrees of MCA stenosis with TCD is higher. The combination of PSVst and PSV/PSVpro is the important criterion for identifying severe MCA stenosis.

Methods: One hundred twenty-two consecutive patients with chronic MCA occlusion detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography ( TCD ) and confirmed by digital subtraction angiography ( DSA ) were included. According to the DSA images, the conditions of ACA meningeal branch compensation were divided into either ACA compensation ( n = 72 ) or no compensation ( n = 50 ) groups. Color Doppler flow imaging ( CDFI ) was used to compare the peak systolic velocity ( PSV ) , end diastolic velocity ( EDV ) , pulsatility index ( PI ) , and blood flow volume ( BFV ) of the bilateral EICA, as well as the differences of PSV, EDV, mean velocity ( MFV ) , and PI value of ACA in both groups. Results: Circled digit one PSV, EDV, and BFV of EICA on the ipsilateral side of 122 patients with chronic MCA occlusion were 67 ± 17 cm/s, 27 ± 8 cm/s, and 397 ± 154 ml/min, respectively, and they were lower than those on the contralateral side( P < 0. 01 ). Circled digit two PSV, EDV, and BFV of EICA on the ipsilateral side in the no compensation group were 63 ± 18 cm/s, 24 ± 8 cm/s, and 365 ± 153 ml/min, respectively, and they were lower than those on the ipsilateral side in the compensation group and on the contralateral side in the same group ( P < 0. 01 ) ; PI of EICA on the ipsilateral side in the no compensation group was 1. 09 ± 0. 20, and it was higher than that on the ipsilateral in the compensation group and on the contralateral sides in the same group. Circled digit three PSV, EDV, and MFV of ACA on the ipsilateral side in the compensation group were 142 ± 32 cm/s, 67 ± 19 cm/s, and 92 ± 23 cm/s, respectively, and they were higher than those on the contralateral side in the group and on the ipsilateral side in the no compensation group; PI of ACA on the ipsilateral side in the compensation group was 0. 83 ± 0. 15, and it was lower than that on the contralateral side ( P < 0. 01 ). There were no significant differences in the hemodynamic parameters of the bilateral ACA in the no compensation group ( P > 0. 05 ).

46749147150	Application of transcranial Doppler to guide regulation of cerebral blood flow during carotid endarterectomy	Objective: To analyze the value of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) retrospectively for perioperative management of carotid endarterectomy. Method: Carotid endarterectomy was performed in 52 patients with severe carotid stenosis under general anesthesia. The blood flow parameters of middle cerebral artery (MCA) were detected by TCD during the operation. The blood pressure was regulated, and whether need a temporary vascular shunt or not was determined according to the changes of cerebral blood flow parameters. Sixteen patients (shunt group) used temporary vascular shunts and 36 patients (nonshunt group) did not. Results: 1 Fifty-two patients recovered completely after the operation, 50 of them had no brain ischemic attack, and 2 patients died of cerebral hemorrhage due to hyperperfusion. 2 The mean arterial pressures (MAPs) in the shunt group or non shunt group before carotid artery occlusion were 111 ± 9 and 97 ± 15 mm Hg respectively, and there were statistically significant differences between the two groups. The mean flow velocities of MCA (MCA Vm) were 40 ± 12 and 39 ± 13 cm/s respectively, and there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. 3 The MAPs were 118 ± 8 and 106 ± 9mm Hg in the two groups after occlusion, and there were statistically significant differences as compared with those before the occlusion. The MCA Vm were 14 ± 8 and 33 ± 16 cm/s, and they decreased 66 ± 6% and 15 ± 5% respectively as compared with those before the occlusion. 4 The MAP was 110 ± 13 mm Hg during the bypass in the shunt group, and it was near the level before occlusion, the MCA Vm was 44 ± 15 cm/s, it increased 10 ± 2% as compared with that before the occlusion. 5 the MAPs were 90 ± 12 and 93 ± 11 mm Hg in the two groups after opening of the carotid artery; The MCA Vm were 55 ± 19 and 54 ± 23, they increased 36 ± 3% and 37 ± 4% as compared with those before carotid artery occlusion, and there were statistically significant differences. Conclusion: The application of TCD monitoring in perioperative management can evaluate cerebral blood flow perfusion, guiding the regulation of blood pressure and selection of vascular shunt during the operation.

58149279786	Effect of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis on the cerebral blood flow of ischemic lesions in carotid artery system	Objective: To investigate the effect of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis on the cerebral blood flow of patients with atherosclerotic carotid artery occlusion, middle cerebral artery occlusion or severe stenosis and its therapeutic effect. Methods: The state of cerebral blood flow in forty-nine patients were evaluated by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), transcramal color duplex sonography (TCCD), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (n = 24) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) (n = 16) preoperatively. All the patients were showed cerebral hemodynamic disturbance and underwent STA-MCA anastomosis. Routine cerebral angiography was performed and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated again postoperatively. T he patients were followed up once every 3 to 6 months postoperatively for 36 months. The postoperative neurological functional status of the patients was assessed according to the modified Rankin scale (mRS). Results: TCD showed the blood flow of distal MCA in 49 patients improved significantly postoperatively (P < 0.05); TCCD showed the STA calibers on the affected sides in 42 patients were larger than that on the contralateral side after the procedures, the peak velocity was accelerated and the resistance index was decreased (P < 0.05 all). SPECT demonstrated the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) ratios between the affected and contralateral sides in 24 patients were significantly higher than that before the procedures (P < 0.05). PWI displayed that the time to peak (TTP) in MCA region was significantly shorter after the procedures in 16 patients (P < 0.05). Postoperative angiography demonstrated that the anastomotic orifice in 42 of the 49 patients were patent, and in 7 were not. The patients did not reoccur ischemic stroke related to the affected sides during the follow-up period. There was statistical significance between the mRS score (0.5 ± 0.7) of 32 patients followed up for 36 months after the procedures and that (1.7 ± 0.5) before the procedures (P<0.01). Conclusions: STA-MCA anastomosis improves the cerebral blood flow distal to carotid artery or middle cerebral artery occlusion or severe stenosis, and may improve the neurological condition, and prevent the occurrence of ischernic stroke in patients with cerebral hemodynamic disturbances.

6444244592	Experience of minimally invasive treatment in 520 patients with intracranial aneurysms	Objective. To summarize the experience of minimally invasive treatment in 520 patients with intracranial aneurysms on a retrospective study. Methods. The measures used in the treatment of 520 patients were reviewed in terms of timing of surgery, induced-hypotensive anesthesia, brain protection combined with temporal occlusion of the feeding artery, external drainage of CSF, dynamic monitoring of intracranial pressure, blood flow velocity, serum osmolality and CT scanning, anti-vasospasm therapy as well as selected interventional endovascular embolization of aneurysms. Results. Of the 520 patients, 485 were treated with either direct clipping or endovascular embolization and 35 patients were treated non-surgically. In 449 patients undergoing direct clipping and 36 undergoing endovascular embolization, intraoperative rupture of aneurysm occurred in 27 (6. 0%) and 0%, respectively. Death occurred in 13 (2. 6%), hemiplegia in 8 (1. 6%), and vegetative state in 2 (0. 4%). The operative mortality of direct clipping was 3.8% in 210 patients before 1990 and 1.8% in 275 patients after 1990 (36 patients undergoing endovascular embolization, the operative mortality was 0%). Conclusion. The outcome of patients with intracranial aneurysms can be markedly improved and the operative mortality can be lowered by minimally invasive treatment.

67349288107	Treatment of symptomatic complex posterior circulation cerebral artery stenosis with balloon-mounted stents: Technique feasibility and outcome	Purpose: This study aimed to retrospectively analyze a series of patients with complex posterior circulation stenosis who underwent stent-assisted angioplasty to evaluate the feasibility of the procedure and summarize the experience with regard to complications. Methods: A total of 16 consecutive patients with 27 complex posterior circulation artery stenoses refractory to medical therapy were enrolled. Technical success rate, periprocedural complication, and long-term follow-up result were evaluated. Results: The study population included 16 patients with 27 lesions. A total of 36 stents were successfully implanted. The technical success rate was 100%, and the overall periprocedural complication rate was 12.5% (2/16). During a median of 25.5 months of follow-up, three patients presented recurrent transient ischemic attacks, which were confirmed had restenosis more than 50% by control angiography or transcranial Doppler. Conclusions: Stent-assisted angioplasty is a feasible treatment method for complex posterior circulation artery stenosis. However, it appears to be associated with a relatively high periprocedural complication rate. Therefore, strict periprocedural management to reduce mortality and morbidity is needed. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

Methods: A total of 288 patients with congenital unilateral vertebral artery hypoplasia were examined by color Doppler flow image. They were selected from 5500 patients with suspected posterial circulation ischemia from Apr. to Jun. 2008 in this study. The diameter, peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV) and resistance index (RI) at intervertebral segment of the vertebral arteries were compared between the normal and hypoplastic vertebral artery. Results: Circled digit one The mean diameter of hypoplastic VA was 2.21 ±0.20 mm, it was much smaller than that of the normal VA 3.39 ±0.47 mm significantly (t = - 39.746, P < 0.01). Circled digit two Among 288 patients with VAH, the patients with diameter of the vertebral arteries between 2.0 mm and 2.5 mm (227/288 cases) were more than patients with diameter less than 2.0 mm (61/288 cases), and the hypoplasia was more often detected in the right VA (207/288 cases) than in the left VA (81/288 cases), and more common in the female (162/288 cases) than in the male patients (126/288 cases). Circled digit three The PSV and EDV of hypoplastic VA were lower than those of normal VA, of which the PVS were 52 ± 11 cm/s vs 59 ± 10 cm/s, the EDV were 17 ± 6 cm/s vs 23 ± 5 cm/s (P < 0.01), respectively, but the RI of hypoplastic VA was 0.66 ± 0.07, which was higher than that of normal VA (0.61 ± 0.06) (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Congenital vertebral artery hypoplasia may cause abnormal hemodynamics of extracranial vertebral artery. Color Doppler Ultrasonography is an objective method to evaluate it.

69749128023	Analysis of the relationship between vertebral artery hypoplasia and vertigo with vascular ultrasonography	Objective: To investigate the relationship between vertebral artery hypoplasia and the occurrence of vertigo. Methods: A total of 288 patients with unilateral vertebral artery hypoplasia (hypoplasia group) were recruited. They were divided into either a vertigo group (n = 201) or a non-vertigo group (n = 87). Color Doppler flow image (CDFI) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) were used to analyze the relationship between vertebral artery hypoplasia and vertigo. Results: Circled digit one The overall incidence of vertigo in patients with vertebral artery hypoplasia was 69.8% (201/288) among them, the vertebral artery diameter ≤2. 0 mm in 61 patients, the incidence of vertigo was 83.6% (51/61); the vertebral artery diameter 2.0-2.5 mm in 227 patients, the incidence of vertigo was 66.1% (150/227) (P = 0.008). Circled digit two The ipsilateral vertebral artery diameters in the vertigo and non-vertigo groups were 2.18 ±0.21 mm and 2.27 ±0.17 mm, respectively, and the contralateral vertebral artery diameters were 3.54 ±0.46 mm and 3.03 ±0.27 mm, respectively. P <0.01 all. The peak systolic velocity at the intervertebral segment and intracranial segment of ipsilateral vertebral artery in the vertigo group were 51 ±10 cm/s and 49 ± 9 cm/s, respectively, and in the non-vertigo group were 54 ±11 cm/s and 52 ±10 cm/s, respectively. There was a statistical difference between the two groups (P <0.05 all). The peak systolic velocity at the ipsilateral intracranial segment in the vertigo group was significantly lower than that at the intervertebral segment (P < 0.05), and there was no significant difference in the non-vertigo group. Among the patients with vertebral artery hypoplasia, the incidences of vertigo were 47.6%, 67.2%, and 80.5% respectively in patients aged 21-39 years, 40-59 years, and 60-81 years (χ

72449164929	Effect of insulin therapy on carotid intima-media thickness in patients with type 2 diabetes: An ultrasonographic study	Objective: To investigate the correlation between pre- insulin therapy period (the time from definite diagnosis to initiation of insulin therapy), insulin therapy period and the intima-media thickness of common carotid artery (CCA-IMT) in patients with type 2 diabetes by means of color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU). Methods: Two hundred and fifty-two patients with type 2 diabetes were included in this study, 138 were male and 114 were female, their age ranged from 22 to 87 (mean 59 ± 14) years; the course of disease was 1 to 43 (mean 9.3 ± 3.3) years; The duration of insulin therapy was 0 to 20 (mean 4.2 ± 1.5) years; and pre- insulin therapy period was 0 to 43 (mean 7.1 ± 2.3) years. The CCA-IMT was detected with two-dimensional high-frequency ultra sonography. The mean value of bilateral CCA-IMT was calculated. The possible risk factors [age, duration of insulin therapy, pre- insulin therapy period, fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, triglyceride, total cholesterol (TCH), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)] that might impact CCA-IMT were analyzed with multiple linear regression, and their risk factors were identified. Partial correlation analysis was used to control the impact of risk factors on CCA-IMT. The relationship between the pre- insulin therapy period, insulin therapy period and CCA-IMT were observed. Results: Circled digit oneAge, LDL-C level and pre- insulin therapy period were linearly related to CCA-IMT (standardized coefficients Beta = 0.580, 0.242, and 0.195, respectively, P < 0.05). The regression equation was Y = 0.241 + 0.008 X1 + 0.060 X2 + 0.005 X3 (X1 = age, X2 = LDL-C, X3 = pre-exogenous insulin period). Circled digit twoAfter controlling the above risk factors, the pre- insulin therapy period and the mean value of CCA-IMT showed a linear positive correlation (r = 0.294, P = 0.003), while the insulin therapy period and the mean value of CCA-IMT showed a negative correlation (r = -0. 091, P = 0.376), but there was no significant differences (r = -0.091, P = 0.376). The IMT was 0.60 to 1.39 mm (mean 0.96 ± 0.19 mm). Conclusion: Two-dimensional high-frequency ultrasound may be used as an important means for evaluating the effect of the insulin therapy on atherosclerotic lesions in patients with type 2 diabetes. Early start of insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes may have positive effect on slowing the progression of atherosclerosis.

78649944165	Changes of cerebral hemodynamics detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography after internal carotid artery stenting	Objective: To evaluate the value of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) in detecting the changes of cerebral hemodynamics after bilateral internal carotid artery stenting. Methods: A total of 18 patients with bilateral severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (n = 8) or severe stenosis on one side and occlusion on the other side (n = 10) were selected. TCD was used to detect the changes of hemodynamic parameters of extracranial and intracranial artery before and after stenting. Results: Circled digit oneTCD sensitivity for the diagnosis of ICA occlusion was 100% (10/10), the specificity for the diagnosis of stenosis or occlusion was 96% (25/26), and the overall compliance rate was 97% (35/36). Circled digit twoThe preoperative peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the stenotic segment of extracranial internal carotid artery (EICA) was 241 ± 55 cm/s; 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the procedure they were 59 ± 15, 58 ± 12, 59 ± 15, 61 ± 14, and 64 ± 16 cm/s, respectively. Compared to those before the procedure, the differences were statistically significant. However, comparing to the various stages after the procedure, there were no statistical differences. Circled digit threePSV of middle cerebral artery (MCA) on the stented side after the procedure was higher than that before the procedure (59 ± 14, 120 ± 24 cm/s, P = 0.000). Vascular pulsatility index (PI) was improved significantly (0.64 ± 0.15, 1.05 ± 0.19; P = 0.000). PVS of MCA occlusion after the procedure was also increased slightly (48 ± 17, 70 ± 16 cm/s, P = 0.005), while the changes of PI values was not significant ( P= 0.379). Circled digit fourTwo patients had patent anterior communicating artery (AcoA) before the procedure, AcoA was occluded after bilateral carotid artery stenting; 11 patients had patent AcoA after the procedure, and 10 of them were unilateral occlusion and stenosis on the other side. One patient had bilateral severe stenosis, but only had unilateral stenting. There were 24 (66.7%) patent posterior communicating arteries (PcoA), 18 of them were occluded after the procedure. Conclusion: TCD can be used in the evaluation of the extracranial and intracranial hemodynamic changes in patients with bilateral internal carotid artery disease before, during, and after the procedure.

78651311177	Analysis of the recurrence of ischemic cerebrovascular disease in patients with patent foramen ovale	Objective: To observe the recurrence of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) in order to investigate the effect of PFO in the occurrence of cerebral ischemia. Methods: Seventy-one patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (aged 15 to 55 years) admitted in the Department of Neurology, Xuan Wu Hospital from March 2008 to March 2009 were selected. They were all examined by transesophageal echocardiography. There were 49 patients in a PFO group and 22 in a non-PFO group. The recurrence of ischemic cerebrovascular attack within 12 months in both groups was compared. Results: Cerebral ischemia reoccurred in 8 patients in the PFO group, while only one reoccurrence in the non-PFO group. Circled digit oneThe recurrence rates at 3, 6, and 12 months in the PFO and non-PFO groups were 6.12% vs. 0.00% , 10.20% vs. 4.55% , and 16.33% vs. 4.55%, respectively, and there were no significant differences (P = 0.322, P=0.428, and P=0.168). Circled digit twoThe cumulative recurrence rate of ischemic cerebrovascular disease in the PFO group was higher than that in the non-PFO group, but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.065). The risk ratio was 3.76 (95% CI 0.834 to 16.946), the difference was also not statistically significant (P =0.085). Conclusion: The recurrence rate of ischemic cerebrovascular disease in patients with PFO tends to increase, but the probability of PFO in increasing the recurrence of cerebral ischemia still not able to be determined.

79851513907	Evaluation of severe subclavian artery stenosis by color doppler flow imaging	This study evaluates the diagnostic value of the hemodynamic parameters of color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) for severe (70 to 99%) subclavian artery stenosis (SAS) using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the reference standard. Two-hundred fifty-two patients with suspected SAS were recruited into the study and examined from June 2005 to December 2009. The degree of stenosis was classified as moderate (50 to 69%) or severe (70 to 99%) stenosis. By using CDFI, the residual diameter (Dr), peak systolic velocity (PSV1) and end diastolic velocity (EDV) at the stenotic vessel segments, as well as the original diameter (Do) and PSV2 of the relative normal segments distal to the stenosis (the segment distal to the poststenotic dilation) were recorded. The diameter stenosis rate (1-Dr/Do) and PSV ratio (PSV1/PSV2) were calculated. Using DSA as the reference standard, the diagnostic values and optimal cutoff values for each parameter for the evaluation of severe (70%-99%) were determined using receiving operating characteristic curve analysis. Among the 252 patients, 109 patients were diagnosed as having severe (70 to 99%) SAS and 143 patients had moderate (50 to 69%) SAS. The optimal cutoff values for PSV1, EDV and the PSV1/PSV2 ratio for evaluating severe (70 to 99%) SAS were PSV1 ≥343 cm/s, EDV ≥60 cm/s and PSV1/PSV2 ≥4.0, respectively. The accuracy for diagnosing SAS with PSV1 (86.1%) was higher than that of EDV (85.7%), PSV1/PSV2 (84.9%) and 1-Dr/Do (80.2%). In addition, when PSV1 was used in combination with EDV and 1-Dr/Do, the accuracy for diagnosing SAS increased from 86.1% to 87.3%. When PSV1 was used in combination with EDV and PSV1/PSV2, the accuracy for diagnosing SAS reached 95.8%. In conclusion, the CDFI hemodynamic parameters of PSV1, EDV and PSV1/PSV2 show good consistency with DSA for diagnosing severe (70 to 99%) SAS, and a combination of these three parameters can ensure even greater accuracy for diagnosing SAS. © 2011 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

79959870556	Characteristics of large vascular lesions detected by trancranial Doppler in diabetic patients complicated with hypertension	Objective: To investigate the vascular structure and characteristics of hemodynamic changes of intra-and extracranial arterial lesions in diabetic patients with hypertension. Methods: The detection rates of intracranial artery, carotid artery and lower extremity arterial atherosclerosis lesions in patients with diabetes mellitus complicated with hypertension and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus alone were evaluated respectively using transcranial Doppler (TCD) and color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI). The difference of atherosclerotic lesions between the 2 groups of patients was observed. A total of 191 patients with type 2 diabetic mellitus whose blood lipids were normal and no risk factors of smoking were admitted to the Department of Endocrinology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University from September 2009 to August 2010 were recruited. They were divided into either a diabetes group (group A, n = 100) or a diabetes with hypertension group (group B, n = 91). The intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid arteries and femoral artery, the total detection rate of all the branches of intracranial artery, carotid and lower extremity artery stenosis, as well as the differences of the detection rate of > 50% stenosis were compared in both groups; the course of disease in patients with diabetes and hypertension, the effect of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure factors on artery stenosis in diabetes were analyzed. Results: Circled digit oneThe IMT of common carotid artery and femoral artery in group B was significantly higher than that in group A. They were 0.98 ± 0.14 mm vs. 0.86 ± 0.17 mm and 1.03 ± 0.16 mm vs. 0.90 ± 0.16 mm respectively (all P = 0.000). Circled digit twoThe detection rates of plaques in carotid arteries and lower extremity arteries in group B were significantly higher than those in group A (P < 0.01). The proportions of the plaque feature at 2 sites between the two groups were different (P < 0.01). The detection rates of calcified plaques of hyperechoic echoes and heterogeneous echoes in group B was higher than those in group A (P < 0.01). Circled digit threeIn the comparison of the total detection rate of extracranial-intracranial artery stenosis and the detection rate of stenosis > 50% in the 2 groups, the total detection rate of artery stenosis at 3 sites in group B was significantly higher than that in group A. The differences were statistically significant (all P <0.05). In the comparison of the detection rate > 50% stenosis, the prevalence of intracranial artery stenosis in group B was higher than that in group A. The difference was statistically significant (P <0.05), and there was no significant difference between the carotid artery and lower extremity artery (P > 0.05). Circled digit fourThe course of hypertension, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure in group B were positively correlated with the common carotid artery IMT (R=0.417, 0.351, and 0.283, P<0.05). Systolic blood pressure level was positively correlated with the detection rate of the intracranial and lower extremity artery stenosis (R = 0.912, 0.795, P=0.000). Conclusion Diabetes accompanied with hypertension may increase the incidence of atherosclerotic lesions; the combination of CDFI and TCD has important value in predicting the occurrence of cerebral carotid artery and lower extremity arterial complications as well as the clinical comprehensive assessment in patients with diabetes.

80054891922	Primary angioplasty for a subtype of symptomatic middle cerebral artery stenosis	Introduction The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term efficacy of middle cerebral artery revascularisation by primary balloon angioplasty for the prevention of stroke in a certain subtype of patients. Method A retrospective study was performed to evaluate 33 patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery stenoses who underwent primary balloon angioplasty; the selection criteria were: greater than 70% stenosis measured by digital subtraction angiography, lesions equal to or shorter than 5 mm, lesions near or across a bifurcation, and lesions with very tortuous proximal vessels that increase the risk of stenting. All patients were available for follow-up ranging from 6 to 60 months. The technical success rate, periprocedural complications, and long-term outcome were retrospectively reviewed. Result The mean stenosis degree was reduced from 87.12± 7.40 to 23.03±9.84 after angioplasty. The periprocedural complication rate was 18.18% (six dissections without an ischemic event). Two patients had strokes in the territory of the angioplasty at 6 and 32 months after angioplasty, and the stroke-free survival at 5 years was 90.04% (mean survival time, 56.42±2.43 months; 95% CI, 51.66-61.19 months). Conclusion These results suggest that this treatment is safe and could provide a durable clinical result at long-term follow-up in this subtype of patients, but the high rate of dissection remains a major technical drawback. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

83255186584	Effects of anterior communicating artery patency on the hemodynamic alteration of contralateral extracranial-intracranial artery after severe unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion	Objective: To study the effects of anterior communicating artery (ACoA) patency on the hemodynamic alteration in contralateral extracranial-intracranial artery after severe stenosis (70% to 99%) or occlusion of unilateral extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA). Methods: Two hundred twenty-eight patients with severe unilateral ICA stenosis or occlusion and normal or stenosis <50% (referred to relatively normal) of the contralateral ICA were enrolled in the study. Among them, there were 113 patients with and 115 without patent ACoA. Color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) was used to measure the diameters of bilateral proximal ICA, the peak systolic velocity (PSV), the end-diastolic flow velocity (EDV), and the vascular resistance index (RI). Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was used to measure the PSV, EDV, and pulsatility index (PI) of the bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA). The effects of ACoA patency on the hemodynamics of ICA, MCA and ACA of the relatively normal side were analyzed. Results: Circled digit oneThere was no significant difference in the diameter of ICA on the relatively normal side between the ACoA unpatent group and the ACoA patent group. The PSV and EDV on the relatively normal side in the ACoA patent group were higher than those in the ACoA unpatent group (P < 0.000) while the RI was lower than that in the ACoA unpatent group (P = 0.001). Circled digit twoThe PSV and EDV of MCA and ACA on the ICA relatively normal side in the ACoA patent group were higher than those in the ACoA unpatent group (P = 0.000) and the PI was lower than that in the ACoA unpatent group, however, there was significant difference only in PI of ACA between the two groups (P = 0.007). Circled digit oneThe correlation analysis showed that the mean velocity of MCA and ACA on the relatively normal side was positively correlated with that of ICA (r = 0.587, 0.346, P = 0.000). Conclusion: When one side of ICA is severely stenotic or occlusion, the ACoA patency will directly influence the hemodynamic alteration of the extracranial ICA as well as MCA and ACA on the other side.

Methods: A total of 102 consecutive patients with bilateral ICA stenosis (unilateral stenosis 50-69%, contralateral stenosis 70-99% or occlusion) were enrolled from June 2005 to June 2011 and they were used as study group (group A). The patients were screened by color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) and TCD, and they were confirmed as bilateral ICA stenosis by DSA. At the same time, 89 patients with unilateral ICA stenosis 50-69% and normal contralateral ICA were used as control group (group B). The differences of ICA stenosis 50-69% in the two groups and the peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic flow velocity (EDV), resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) of anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in both groups were compared. Group A was redivided into an anterior communicating antery patent group (A1 group, n = 54) and an anterior communicating artery occluded group (A2 group, n = 48) according to the results of TCD and DSA examinations. The differences of the hemodynamic parameters of the 50-69% stenotic ICA and ACA stenosis, and the correlations of the hemodynamic changes in both groups were further compared. Results: Circled digit oneThe PSV and EDV of unilateral stenotic ICA stenosis and ACA with 50-69% stenosis in group A were significantly higher than those in group B (all P < 0.05), RI and PI were significantly lower (P = 0.001, P = 0.000). Circled digit twoPSV and EDV of unilateral ICA and ACA with 50-69% stenosis in group A1 were higher than those in group A2 (all P < 0.01), but RI of ICA and PI of ACA in group A1 were lower than those in group A2 (P = 0.000, P = 0.000), the differences were statistically significant. Circled digit threeThe velocity of ICA was positively correlated with that of ACA (r = 0.327, 0.422, P = 0.007, P = 0.000). Conclusion: When one side of internal carotid artery is severely stenotic, the measured value of velocity of the other side of ICA (50-69% stenosis) is significantly higher than the diagnostic criteria of the actual lesion. The anterior communicating artery patency is the basis of hemodynamic changes of the bilateral stenotic ICA. The identification of the degree of bilateral ICA stenosis should be evaluated comprehensively in combination with the extracranial and intracranial hemodynamic changes.

83255192050	Hemodynamics alteration after the vertebral artery stenting in patients with bilateral vertebral artery severe stenosis and its relationship with restenosis	Objective: To investigate the effect of contralateral vertebral arterial hemodynamics after unilateral vertebral artery stenting and its relationship with restenosis. Methods: A total of 155 patients with severe stenosis (70-99%) at the origin of unilateral vertebral artery confirmed by digital subtract angiography (DSA) and underwent stent implantation were recruited in the study. According to the contralateral vertebral artery lesions, they were divided into 3 groups: normal group (n = 71), severe stenosis group (n = 29 ) and occlusion group (n = 55). Carotid color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) and transcranial Dopper (TCD) were performed before stenting, within 1 week, and 1 year after stenting. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end diastolic velocity (EDV) of vertebral arteries at the original part (OS), intervertebral segment(IV) and intracranial (IC) segments were recorded. Results: Circled digit oneCompared to the normal group within 1 week after stenting, the PSV

84855665311	Effect of hypertension on intracranial and extracranial atherosclerotic lesions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus	Objective: To investigate the effect of hypertension on the process of carotid atherosclerotic lesions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using ultrasound techniques. Methods: A total of 203 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension were enrolled into the study. The patients were grouped according to the increased systolic blood pressure for 5 mm Hg as an observation unit. The hemodynamic parameters of intracranial and extracranial arteries in each group were measured by using color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) and transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to identify the extent of vascular lesions. The correlations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, hypertension, duration of diabetes with the detection rate of common carotid intimal medial thickness (CCA-IMT), carotid and intracranial arterial stenosis were analyzed. Results: Circled digit oneThe CCA-IMT in 203 patients was 0.62-1.36 mm (mean 1.04 ± 0.14 mm). The detection rate of intracranial arterial stenosis was 52.7%, in which the detection rate of stenosis rate ≥ 50% was 21.2%; the detection rate of extracranial carotid artery stenosis was 28.1%, in which the detection rate of stenosis rate ≥ 50% was 14.8%. The total detection rate of intracranial arterial stenosis and the detection rate of stenosis rate ≥ 50% were higher than extracranial carotid artery, in which there were significant differences in total detection rate of stenosis (P < 0.01), and there were no significant differences in the detection rate of stenosis rate & 50% (P > 0.05). Circled digit twoMultiple stepwise regression analysis showed that there was a linear relationship between the CCA-IMT and systolic blood pressure and age. For each increase of 5 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure, the CCA-IMT would increase 0.015 mm; for each increase of 1 year of age, the CCA-IMT would increase 0.008 mm. Circled digit threeThe total detection rate of intracranial artery stenosis showed a linear relationship with age. For each increase of 1 year of age, the total detection rate of stenosis increased 2.8%; the detection rate of ≥ 50% stenosis showed a linear relationship with systolic blood pressure. For each increase of 5 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure, the detection rate of stenosis increased 2%. Conclusion: the CCA-IMT increases with the increased blood pressure in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. The progression of intracranial arterial stenosis in patients with diabetes mellitus promoted by hypertension is more apparent than carotid artery.

84862100900	Extra-intracranial hemodynamic changes of common carotid artery or brachiocephalic trunk lesions detected with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography	Objective: To evaluate the extra- and intra-cranial hemodynamic changes and collateral circulation after severe stenosis or occlusion of common carotid artery or brachiocephalic trunk (CCA/BT) with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD). Methods: Twenty-four patients with CCA/BT severe stenosis or occlusion confirmed by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were selected as a patients group, and 20 healthy individuals were used as a control group. TCD was used to detect the changes of the intraand extra-cranial artery hemodynamic parameters in both groups. The types of collateral patency were identified. Results: Circled digit oneIn the 17 patients with CCA/BT occlusion, 13 were not detected blood flow signals at the Location of CCA/BT, and 4 showed abnormal low velocity and high resistance blood flow signals; in the 8 patients with CCA/BT severe stenosis, 6 showed abnormal high velocity with turbulent flow spectrum at the local lesions and 2 with CCA low velocity and low-pulsatile blood flow spectrum at the sites distal to the stenosis were probed. The external carotid arteries of 24 patients were the reversed blood flow direction and low-pulsatile internal carotid artery blood flow spectrum changes. The origins of internal carotid artery of 21 patients were low velocity and low-pulsatile blood flow spectrum. Circled digit twoThe velocity and pulsatility index of the middle cerebral arteries were significantly lower than those of the contralateral sides and the control group (P < 0.01). The ophthalmic arteries showed a low-pulsatile forward flow spectrum in 19 patients, no blood flow signals were detected in 3 patients, and the flow spectrum of reversed notches were detected in 2. Circled digit threeIn the 24 patients, the circle of Willis in 19 (79%) cases showed collateral patency, and 3 had the contralateral external carotid collateral blood supply. Nine patients showed the blood flow spectrum changes with a steal from the anterior circulation and the anterior cerebral artery in 6 of them (25%) showed systolic early notch flow spectrum changes. The internal carotid artery siphon on the affected sides and ophthalmic arteries showed reverse notch flow spectrum changes in 2 patients. The initial segment of the internal carotid artery in 1 patient with BT occlusion showed the notch flow spectrum changes. Conclusion: The application of TCD may comprehensively assess the extra- and intra-cranial artery hemodynamic changes of CCA/BT lesions.

84862176131	Application of shunting during carotid endarterectomy and impact of collateral circulation on it	Objective: To investigate the advantages and disadvantages of shunting during carotid endarterectomy as well as the impact of contralateral carotid occlusion and the patent of anterior and posterior communicating arteries on it. Methods: A total of 308 patients who performed carotid endarterectomy from January 2000 to September 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. They were divided into shunting (n = 63) and non-shunting (n = 245) groups. The intraoperative microemboli, postoperative stroke and mortality in both groups were compared. The degree of contralateral carotid stenosis, the opening ratios of anterior and posterior communicating arteries were compared in both groups. Its impact on shunting was analyzed. Results: Circled digit oneThe median microemboli count was 25 in the shunting group and it was 10 in the non-shunting group. There was significant difference between the 2 groups (P < 0.05). Circled digit twoThe incidence of ischemic events within one month after surgery: 1 patient (1.6%) had stroke and 0 died in the shunting group; 6 patients (2.4%) had stroke and 4 (1.6%) died in the non-shunting group. There were no significant differences for stroke and mortality between both groups (P > 0.05). Circled digit threeThe degree of contralateral carotid artery stenosis before surgery: 8 patients had occlusion, 8 had severe stenosis, 47 had mild to moderate stenosis or without stenosis in the shunting group; 9 patients had occlusion, 36 had severe stenosis, and 200 had mild to moderate stenosis or without stenosis in the non-shunting group. The rate of occlusion was significant differences between the 2 groups (P < 0.05). Both preoperative anterior and posterior communicating arteries of 35 patients(55.6%) did not open in the shunting group and 81 (33.1%) did not open in the non-shunting group. There was significant difference between the 2 groups (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Although using shunting may increase the number of microemboli in carotid endarterectomy, but not increase the incidence of perioperative stroke and mortality. The patients with preoperative contralateral carotid artery occlusion or unpatented anterior and posterior communicating arteries, the proportion of using shunting is significantly higher than the other patients.

84862224149	Efficacy and safety assessment of carotid endarterectomy for carotid stenosis	Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of using carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the treatment of patients with carotid stenosis and the effect of related factors on perioperative complications. Methods: The clinical data of 302 patients with carotid stenosis (6 of them underwent bilateral operation at two different stages, each patient was calculated as 2, therefore, there were a total of 308 patients) treated with CEA in Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University from January 2000 to September 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. The safety and efficacy of the operation was analyzed. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the related factors for affecting stroke and death within 30 days after operation. Results: Circled digit oneAmong the 308 patients, 255 patients with simple stenosis were all successful in the operations. Of the 53 patients with complete or nearly complete occlusion, 5 were failed for recanalizations. The surgical success rate was 98.4%. Circled digit two14 patients (4.5%) had stroke or died within 30 days after operation, among them 4 died (1.3%), 7 had cerebral infarction (2.3%), 3 had cerebral hemorrhage (1.0%); 10 had cranial nerve injury (3.3%), 2 had myocardial infarction (0.6%), 2 had angina pectoris (0.6%), 2 had heart failure (0.6%), 8 had arrhythmia (2.6%), and 20 (6.5%) had temporary mental symptoms. Circled digit threeA total of 299 patients were followed up for ≥1 month(mean 25.7 months). Eleven patients (3.7%) had restenosis, and 10 of them occurred at about 1 year. Two patients (0.7%) had transient ischemic attack (TIA), and both them had restenosis. Circled digit fourThe univariate analysis results showed that the patients whose mRS ≥ 3 the early postoperative complications increased significantly (P < 0.05); the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that smoking (OR = 0.198,95% CI 1.237-14.676) and mRS ≥ 3 (OR = 11.707, 95% CI 3.101-44.193) were the independent influencing factors for stroke and death within 30 days after operation. Conclusion: CEA may effectively prevent and treat the carotid artery stenosis caused stroke. Smoking and mRS ≥ 3 may increase the surgical risk of patients.

84862228534	Effect of contralateral carotid occlusion on perioperative efficacy of carotid endarterectomy	Objective: To investigate the effect of contralateral carotid occlusion on perioperative efficacy of carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Methods: The clinical data of 296 patients with carotid stenosis performed unilateral CEA in Xuanwu Hospital from January 2000 to September 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. They were divided into either a contralateral occlusion group (n = 17) or a non-occlusion group (n = 279) according to whether they had contralateral carotid occlusion or not. The intraoperative shunting application and the efficacy within 30 days after surgery in both groups were analyzed. Results: Circled digit oneThe intraoperative shunting application rate in the contralateral occlusion group was 47.1% (8/17), and it was higher than 18.3% (51/279) in the non-contralateral occlusion group (P = 0.010). Circled digit twoAmong the 8 patients who used shunting in the contralateral occlusion group, 4 (4/8) had anterior communicating artery patent; among the 9 patients without using shunting, 2 (2/9) had anterior communicating artery patent (P = 0.335). Among the patients who used shunting, 3 (3/8) had posterior communicating artery patent, and among the patients who did not use shunting, 9 (9/9) had posterior communicating artery patent (P = 0.009). Circled digit threeOf the 279 patients in the contralateral non-occlusion group, the postoperative stroke rate at day 30 was 3.2% (9/279); the mortality was 1.4% (4/279). Brain nerve damage and cardiac complications were 3.6% (10/279) respectively; in addition to 2 (11.8%) had cardiac complications, no other complications occurred in the contralateral occlusion group, but there were no significant differences in complications and mortality in both groups. Conclusion: In patients complicating with contralateral carotid occlusion, CEA may increase the rate of shunting application, especially in patients with patent posterior communicating artery, however, it does not increase the risks of perioperative complications and mortality.

84867908914	Correlation analysis of internal jugular vein abnormalities and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis	Background Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a special form of stroke with multiple causes and risk factors. However, there are still a portion of cases with unknown reasons. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between internal jugular vein (IJV) abnormalities and the development of CVST. Methods A total of 51 CVST patients and 30 healthy controls were enrolled. The diameter, the maximum velocity (Vmax) and the reflux time in bilateral IJVs were measured by color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI). The paired t test was used to compare the numeric values between the bilateral IJVs. The Pearson chi-square test was used to evaluate the relationship between IJV abnormality and CVST, IJV abnormality and IJV reflux, respectively. Results Among the 51 CVST patients, 20 (39%) patients were with normal IJV and 31 (61%) patients were with abnormal IJV. The types of IJV abnormality included annulus stenosis 19 cases (61%), hypoplasia 9 cases (29%), thrombosis 2 cases (7%) and anomalous valve 1 case (3%). In patients with unilateral IJV abnormality, the minimum diameter of the IJV on the lesion side was significantly smaller than that of the contralateral side (P <0.0001). When compared with contralateral side, the Vmax of the lesion side with unilateral annulus stenosis was significant higher, however, it was obvious lower in patients with unilateral hypoplasia (P <0.05). Furthermore, among 27 cases with unilateral IJV abnormality, all the CVST occurred on the same side as the IJV lesions. Conclusion IJV abnormality closely correlated with the development of CVST, which is a newly identified risk factor for CVST.

84867604797	Values of hemodynamics monitoring via ocular window with transcranial Doppler during carotid endarterectomy	Objective: To investigate the validity and reliability of transcranial color Doppler (TCD) via the ocular window when the temporal window pentrated poor during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Methods: Eight patients were monitored with TCD via the ocular window during CEA. TCD was used to evaluate the patency of collateral circulation before procedure and it was confirmed by DSA. Intraoperative cerebral blood flow was monitored, the parameters such as the peak systolic velocity (PSV) , end diastolic velocity (EDV), mean velocity (MV) and pulse index (PI) of the ipsilateral ophthalmic artery (OA) and/or carotid siphon (CS) at the different time points were record after anesthesia, before and after carotid occlusion, after shunt placement, and patency of carotid artery. Results: Circled digit one 4 of 8 patients used shunt because of the adverse compensation of communicating artery. OA and CS were monitored with dual-depth monitoring in 3 patients ; CS was monitored alone in 2, and OA was monitored alone in 3. Circled digit twoCompared to the carotid arteries before clipping, the PSV, MV, EDV and PI of OA decreased significantly after clipping. The differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). PI of OA increased significantly after the patency of carotid blood flow (P < 0.05); compared to before clipping the carotid arteries, the PSV of CS decreased significantly (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in comparing the blood flow after patency with all the parameters before clipping (P > 0.05). Circled digit threeThe surgical monitoring was successful in 7 patients. Only one patient had cerebral infarction 1 week after procedure and 7 had good prognosis. Conclusion: Monitoring the cerebral blood flow changes via ocular window during CEA may effectively solve the problem of the poor temporal window penetration. Monitoring the blood flow parameters of ipsilateral OA and CS with dual-depth intermittent monitoring are the ideal ways. For patients with incomplete compensation in anterior communicating artery and/or the posterior communicating artery, the use of shunt is recommended. It may prevent intraoperative cerebral ischemia and reduce the occurrence of postoperative stroke.

84871309721	Upper limb ischemic preconditioning prevents recurrent stroke in intracranial arterial stenosis	Objective: This study aims to evaluate protective effects of brief repetitive bilateral arm ischemic preconditioning (BAIPC) on stroke recurrence in patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic intracranial arterial stenosis (IAS). Methods: A total of 68 consecutive cases with symptomatic IAS, diagnosed by imaging, were enrolled in this prospective and randomized study. All patients received standard medical management. Patients in the BAIPC group (n = 38) underwent 5 brief cycles consisting of bilateral upper limb ischemia followed by reperfusion. The BAIPC procedure was performed twice daily over 300 consecutive days. Incidence of recurrent stroke and cerebral perfusion status in BAIPCtreated patients were compared with the untreated control group (n = 30). Results: In the control group, incidence of recurrent stroke at 90 and 300 days were 23.3% and 26.7%, respectively. In the BAIPC group, incidence of recurrent stroke was reduced to 5% and 7.9% at 90 and 300 days (p<0.01), respectively. The average time to recovery (modified Rankin Scale score 0-1) was also shortened by BAIPC. Cerebral perfusion status, measured by SPECT and transcranial Doppler sonography, improved remarkably in BAIPC-treated brain than in control (p < 0.01). Conclusion: This study provides a proof-of-concept that BAIPC may be an effective way to improve cerebral perfusion and reduce recurrent strokes in patients with IAS. Further investigation of this therapeutic approach is warranted as some patients were excluded after randomization. © 2012 American Academy of Neurology.

84871313843	Efficacies of carotid endarterectomy in the treatment of atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis	Objective: To explore the feasibility and efficacy of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the treatment of atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis (ACAS). Methods: From January 2002 to December 2010, 126 ACAS patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy at our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. There were 92 males and 34 females with an average age of 65.5 years old (range: 48-75). Among them, 25 had sequelae of cerebral infarction, 69 symptomatic cerebral ischemia and 32 asymptomatic. Sixty-two patients were monitored intra-operatively with transcranial Doppler (TCD). Among them, 5 patients underwent arterial shunt due to a reduced b, ction of blood flow in middle cerebral artery for over 50%. The other 64 patients without TCD monitoring underwent intra-operative arterial shunt. And 22 patients underwent patch angioplasty with autologous or prosthetic vascular patch. Intracranial hyperperfusion was prevented by a compression of common carotid artery or control was successful without perioperative mortality. All patients with cerebral ischemic symptoms and some patients with cerebral infarction sequelae had much post-operative improvement. Deviated tongue protrusion occurred in 10 patients and 8 of them recovered at Week 2 post-operation. And 118 patients were followed up for a mean period of 46.5 months (range: 6-96). Two patients with deviated tongue protrusion had slight improvements; 2 patients with severe carotid artery stenosis underwent stent angioplasty; 4 patients with moderate carotid artery steno, sis received conservative treatment; among 7 deceased patients, two died of cerebral infarction. Conclusion: CEA is effective in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis with a high success rate. TCD monitoring during CEA is valuable for preventing cerebral ischemia and intracranial hyperperfusion. Arterial shunt and arterial patch angioplasty should be considered according to certain conditions during CEA. Copyright © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84870907197	Randomized controlled trial of symptomatic middle cerebral artery stenosis: Endovascular versus medical therapy in a Chinese population	Background and Purpose: To investigate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) for symptomatic middle cerebral artery stenosis compared with standard medical treatment in a low-risk Chinese population. Methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled, single-center clinical trial was conducted comparing PTAS with medical treatment for symptomatic middle cerebral artery stenosis (≥70%). Patients were enrolled according to 1:1 enroll ratio (PTAS: medical). The PTAS group received stenting or balloon angioplasty, whereas the medical treatment group received standard medical treatment (aspirin 100 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg/d), and all the patients were under strict control of the risk factors. The end point events were any kind of ipsilateral stroke or transient ischemic attack, or death from any origin during 1-year follow-up. Results: The enrollment was stopped after 70 patients were enrolled from August 2007 to December 2010, with a 30-day rate of end point events of 8.3% versus 5.9% (P=0.69) for PTAS and medical group, respectively, and 1-year rate of end point events of 19.4% versus 17.6% (P=0.85), respectively. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. The mean follow-up time, which was ongoing, was 9.9 ± 3.9 and 9.7 ± 4.4 months, respectively. Among the risk factors, hypertension was the independent related to the outcome (P=0.015). Conclusions: This study showed that endovascular treatment is as safe but not better than medical treatment for symptomatic middle cerebral artery stenosis in a low-risk Chinese population. History of hypertension increases the risk of recurrent ischemic events. © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.

84872706533	Restenosis after carotid artery stenting followed up with ultrasound and the analysis of its influencing factors	Objectives: To detect the incidence of restenosis after carotid artery stenting (CAS) using ultrasound and to analyze its related influencing factors. Methods: A total of 485 patients (502 stents) treated with CAS in Beijing Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University from January 2008 to June 2012 were enrolled prospectively. The patients were detected by color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) before the procedure, 1 week and 3,6,12,24,36 months after procedure. The changes of carotid arterial hemodynamics and the occurrence of restenosis were evaluated before and after CAS. COX regression analysis was used to analyze the different sonic characteristics, morphology, types of stent, the effects of the residual stenosis and risk factors of disease on the in-stent restenosis after procedure. Results: The median follow-up time was 24 months (range 1 to 36 months). The detection rate of in-stent restenosis during the follow-up period was 8.2% (41/502). The incidences of cumulative restenosis at 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-36 months after CAS were 2.4%, 5.9%, 9.2%, 11.3%, and 11.3%, respectively. COX regression analysis showed that hyperlipidemia (OR, 2.905, 95% CI 1.483-5.694; P = 0.002) and postoperative residual stenosis (OR, 3.689, 95% CI 1.891-7.197, P=0.000) were the independent risk factors for influencing in-stent restenosis, and the open-cell stent was a protective factor of in-stent restenosis (OR, 0.428, 95% CI 0.218-0.842; P=0.014). Conclusion: CDFI can be used to evaluate restenosis after CAS. Using open-cell stents can reduce the incidence of restenosis. The postoperative residual stenosis and hyperlipidemia are the independent risk factors for in-stent restenosis.

84872707354	Relationship between internal jugular vein abnormalities and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis	Objective: To investigate the relationship between internal jugular vein (IJV) abnormalities and the occurrence of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). Methods: A total of 89 patients with CVST treated at the Department of Neurosurgery, Beijing Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University and diagnosed by magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and/or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) from October 2010 to July 2012 were enrolled retrospectively. Color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) was used to detect the diameters of bilateral LIV at different parts (J1, J2, and J3), the maximum velocity (Vmax), and the reflux time. The types and characteristics of the IJV abnormalities in patients with CVST were analyzed, and the IJV structure and hemodynamic parameter values were compared in different lesion groups. Results: Circled digit oneOf the 89 patients, IJV was normal in 25 (28.0%) and IJV was abnormal in 64 patients (72.0%). The types of IJV abnormalities included localized stenosis (n = 39, 60.9%), hypoplasia (n = 17, 26.6%), thrombosis (n = 5, 7.8%), and anomalous valve (n = 3, 4.7%). Circled digit twoThe sides of IJV abnormalities were completely consistent with those of CVST, accounting for 76.6% (49/64). The patients with unilateral IJV abnormalities occurred bilateral CVST, accounting for 6.2% (4/64) and those with bilateral IJV abnormalities occurred unilateral CVST, accounting for 17.2% (11/64). None of lesion side reversed with that of CVST. Circled digit threeAmong the 43 patients with unilateral IJV abnormalities (localized stenosis and hypoplasia), the minimum diameter at the stenosis was significantly smaller than that at the contralateral side (P < 0.01). The Vmax in a localized stenosis group was significantly higher than the contralateral side (109 ± 42 cm/s vs. 70 ± 33 cm/s, P = 0.0002), and the Vmax in a unilateral hypoplasia group was significantly lower than that in the contralateral side (39 ± 24 cm/s vs. 73 ± 36 cm/s, P = 0.004). Circled digit fourIn CVST patients, there was no significant difference in whether they had reflux and the reflux time between the IJV normal group and the IJV abnormal group. Conclusion: IJV abnormalities are associated with the occurrence of CVST and they may be one of the risk factors for CVST.

84872713934	Ultrasound evaluation of residual stenosis after vertebral artery origin stenting and influence of the site of stent	Objective: To evaluate the correlations of the site, type and length of stent and the incidence of residual stenosis of vertebral artery origin stenting (VAOS) with color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI). Methods: A total of 177 patients (192 stents) with atherosclerotic stenosis at the vertebral artery origin treated with stenting from January 2009 to September 2011 were enrolled prospectively. They were grouped according to the lengths (L), sites (SS) and stent types. The changes of the diameter at the vertebral artery origin, peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end diastolic velocity (EDV) before procedure and 1 week after procedure were compared using CDFI. The incidence of residual stenosis after procedure was evaluated. The incidence of residual stenosis was analyzed in different groups. The digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images immediately after procedures and the results of CDFI re-examination within 1 week were evaluated. The in-stent residual stenosis ≥ 20% was defined as residual stenosis. Results: Circled digit oneAccording to the results of DSA, 84 L1 (15mm) stents, 51 L2 (> 15mm) stents, and 57 L3 (< 15mm) stents were implanted. There were 45 SS1 stents (the whole stent was in the vertebral lumen), 113 SS2 stents (1/3 of the stent length extended to the proximal end of vertebral artery origin), and 34 SS3 stents (1/2 of the stent length extended to the proximal end of vertebral artery origin). There were 66 drug-eluting stents and 126 metal bare stents. Circled digit twoWithin 1 week after stenting, the diameters at the vertebral artery origin were significantly enlarged than those before stenting (2.7 ± 0.6 mm vs. 1.1 ± 0.3 mm). PSV and EDV improved significantly compared to before procedure, they were 317 ± 109 cm/s vs. 123 ± 49 cm/s and 102 ± 54 cm/s vs. 33 ± 15 cm/s respectively. Circled digit threeThe detection rate of residual stenosis after procedure was 22.4% (43/192). There were no significant differences in the incidences of residual stenosis among the durg-eluting stents (18.2%), metal bare stents (24.6%) and the different length stent groups (P > 0.05). The incidence of residual stenosis (15.9%) in patients treated with the SS2 stents was significantly lower than that of SS1 stents (31.1%) and SS3 stents (32.4%). Conclusion: Stenting may improve the stenotic lumen and hemodynamics. The site of stent is an independent risk factor for residual stenosis after procedure.

84872721790	Ultrasonographic evaluation of the influencing factors of residual stenosis after carotid artery stenting	Objective: To analyze the incidence of residual stenosis and its influencing factors after carotid artery stenting (CAS) using color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI). Methods: A total of 423 patients (434 stents) who underwent CAS in Beijing Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University from January 2008 to December 2011 were enrolled prospectively. All patients received CDFI examination within 1 week after procedure. The residual stenosis was identified according to the results of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and CDFI. The effects of echo characteristics of carotid artery plaques, morphological changes and stent types (open-cell and closed-cell stents) on the incidence of residual stenosis after CAS were analyzed. Results: Circled digit one The incidence of residual stenosis after procedure was 31.1% (135/434), in which 98.5% (133/135) residual stenoses were <50% and 1.5% (2/135) were ≥50%. Circled digit twoThe incidence of residual stenosis in patients with heterogeneous echo plaque was 34.1%, which was higher than 24.8% of homogenous echo plaque (P < 0.05). In patients with homogenous echo plaque, the incidence of residual stenosis in patients with hyperechoic plaque was 48.6%, which was higher than 17.9% and 14.6% in those with isoechoic and hypoechoic plaque groups (17.9% and 14.6%, P=0.002, P = 0.001). In patients with heterogeneous echo plaque, the incidence of residual stenosis in patients with calcification at the base was 51.3%, which was higher than that in patients without calcification at the base (28.1%, P = 0.000). In patients with irregularly shaped plaque, the incidence of residual stenosis was 35.7%, which was higher than 26.1% in patients with regularly shaped plaque (P = 0.031). Circled digit threeAfter implanting open-cell and close-cell stents, the incidences of residual stenosis were 30.6% (110/360) and 33.8% (25/74) respectively (P = 0.585). The difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.585). Circled digit fourMultiple logistic regression analysis showed that the plaques with calcification at the base (OR, 2.658, 95% CI 1.598-4.560) and hyperechoic plaques (OR, 4.609, 95% CI1.994-10.657) were the independent risk factors for influencing residual stenosis. Conclusion: The heterogeneous echo plaques with calcification at the base of the plaques and simple hyperechoic plaques are the independent risk factors for causing residual stenosis after carotid artery stenting.

84872737640	Vascular ultrasound analysis of restenosis after vertebral artery stenting and its influencing factors	Objective: To evaluate the influence of residual stenosis, stent type and lipid-lowering drugs (statins) on the incidence of in-stent restenosis after vertebral artery origin stenting (VAOS) with color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI). Methods: A total of 177 inpatients (192 stents) whom underwent stenting for vertebral artery origin atherosclerotic stenosis from January 2009 to September 2011 were enrolled prospectively. Fifteen of them were treated with bilateral VAOS, the residual diameter (Ds), original diameter (Dr), peak systolic velocity (PSV), and end diastolic velocity (EDV) on the ipsilateral vertebral artery origin before and one year after the procedure were measured using CDFI. The incidence of in-stent restenosis was identified at 1 year after stenting. The relevant factors of in-stent restenosis after vertebral artery stenting were analysed. Results: Circled digit oneThe rate of residual stenosis at 1 week after procedure was 22.4% (43/192). The incidence of in-stent restenosis at 1 year after procedure was 42.7% (82/192). Circled digit twoThe incidence of in-stent restenosis in patients with residual stenosis after procedure was significantly higher than that in those without residual stenosis (76.7% [33/43] vs. 32.9% [49/149]. P = 0.000). The incidence of restenosis of drug-eluting stents was significantly lower than that of the bare metal stents (30.3% vs. 49.2%) (P = 0.012). Circled digit threeThe VAOS patients who had took statins after procedure the incidence of in - stent restenosis was lower than those who had not took statins (46.7% vs. 65.2%, P = 0.047). Among the patients with hyperlipidemia who had took statins lipid-lowering drugs after procedure, the incidence of in-stent restenosis of VAOS was significantly lower than those had took statins (41.7% vs. 77.8%). Conclusion: The incidence of in-stent restenosis at 1 year after VAOS was high. The postoperative residual stenosis was an independent risk factor for restenosis. Drug-eluting stents and using lipid-lowering drugs regularly after procedure may effectively decrease the incidence of in-stent restenosis.

84886901250	Follow-up study in patients with middle cerebral artery stenosis after stenting with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography	Objective: To evaluate the hemodynamic changes and the incidence of restenosis before and after middle cerebral artery stenosis (MCAS) with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) and to analyze its related influencing factors. Methods: A total of 62 patients (62 stents) who accepted stenting because of symptomatic MCAS were enrolled prospectively from January 2006 to April 2012. TCD was used to detect the hemodynamic parameters of the segment of MCAS, distal stenosis, anterior cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery before procedure and at 1 week, 3, 6, and 12 months after procedure. The incidence of restenosis at 12 months was judged. The effects of residual stenosis, types of stents and disease risk factors on restenosis after MCAS procedure were analyzed. Results: Circled digit oneBefore MCAS stenting and one week after procedure, the peak systolic velocity (PSV) and mean flow velocity (MFV) of the segment of MCAS decreased from 308 ± 59 cm/s and 218 ± 51 cm/s to 159 ± 54 cm/s and 102 ± 39 cm/s respectively. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). Circled digit twoThe detection rate of residual stenosis was 11.3% (7/62) at one week after procedure, and the incidence of restenosis at one year after stenting was 19.4% (12/62). Circled digit threeDiabetes and residual stenosis were an important risk factor for restenosis after stenting (P = 0.024, OR = 7.048, 95% CI 1.286-38.617; P = 0.040, OR = 8.995, 95% CI 1.110-72.911). Circled digit fourWhether regularly taking lipid-lowering drugs, there was significant difference in the incidence of MCA restenosis (7.4% [2/27] vs. 36.4% [8/22]; P = 0.032). Conclusion: TCD can be served as an important means to objectively assess the hemodynamic changes before and after MCAS stenting and the long-term clinical observation. Postoperative residual stenosis and diabetes are the risk factors for the occurrence of restenosis. Regularity taking lipid-lowering drugs after procedure may reduce the incidence of MCA restenosis.

84886929250	Evaluation of the feasibility and safety of carotid endarterectomy for severe carotid artery stenosis and occlusion	Objective: To investigate to the feasibility and safety of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis and occlusion. Methods: The clinical data of 65 patients with severe symptomatic carotid artery stenosis and occlusion admitted in Department of Neurosurgery, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University between January 2001 and December 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. Cerebral hemisphere perfusion was evaluated with CTP or XeCT and the diseased vessels were evaluated with DSA before procedure. The patients were performed CEA only, CEA + Fogarty balloon embolectomy, or CEA + carotid stenting respectively according to the specific lesions. Results: The carotid lesions of all patients were evaluated with DSA. The cerebral blood flow of 15 patients was evaluated with XeCT, and 32 were evaluated with CTP. Of the 65 patients, 26 performed CEA + Fogarty balloon catheter embolectomy. Three of the 4 patients with carotid artery occlusion recanalized successfully. Of the 22 patients with internal carotid artery occlusion, 19 recanalized, and the other 3 did not recanalize. Of the 8 patients who performed complex surgery, one failed to recanalize. Of the 36 patients who performed pure CEA, 5 did not recanalize. The recanalization rate of the patients in this group was 89.2%. Five patients had stroke within 30 days after procedure. Two were hemorrhagic stroke ad one died; the other 2 were ischemic stroke. The postoperative stroke or mortality rate was 1.1%. Conclusion: For patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusion, recanalization therapy can be performed after a rigorous selection of indications and adequate preoperative radiographic evaluation. The follow-up study has shown a better feasibility and safety.

0142153980	Treatment and short-term follow-up of symptomatic atherosclerotic intracranial artery stenosis by stent-assisted angioplasty	Atherosclerotic intracranial artery stenosis can cause hypoperfusion of brain tissues and embolus formation, causing stroke. Conservative medical treatment seemed to have little effect on the natural history and prevent the stroke attack caused by artery stenosis. The purpose of stent-assisted angioplasty is to reconstruct the damaged vessels: the indications, feasibility, effectiveness, complications and follow-up for this new treatment method are discussed. A series of 32 cases with symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis were accepted from 1998 to 2002. The mean age was 42 yrs (31 ∼ 76 yr), male/female ratio=23/9. All patients were refractory to optimal medical therapy. Lesions included 12 middle cerebral arteries (37.5%), six basilar arteries (18.75%), three distal ICAs (9.38%) and 12 intracranial Vas (37.5%). All patients were treated by methods of transluminal stent-assisted angioplasty under general anesthesia. Patients were premedicated with Aspirin (300mg/per day) and Ticlopidine (250mg/per day), this was continued for six weeks after the procedure. Medical history, anamnesis, and treatment protocol were reviewed and evaluated retrospectively, shortterm follow-up (2mths ∼ 1 yr) was also obtained. Primary clinical presentations were TIAs (21/32, 65.63%), minor stroke ( 8/32, 25%) and severe stroke (3/32, 9.38%). 31 cases (96.86%) were successfully implanted with coronary stents within the stenosed vessels; technical success rate was 96.86%. Instant angiographic results showed the stenosed extent had decreased from 72.36%±5.69 to 10.16%±6.94. One vessel ruptured during the procedure, the patient recovered after surgical repair of the ruptured vessel. Clinical follow-up demonstrated symptoms resolved in most patients (30/32, 93.75%) within the follow-up period, two cases with MCA stenosis had TIAs within two months after the procedure. 12 cases accepted angiographic follow-up. Velocities ofstented vessels of five cases (5/21,23.81 %) increased compared to instant results, suggesting restenosis, three of them were confirmed by angiography which included two cases with MCA stenosis (figure 3) and one with distal VA, one of the five cases had recurred TIAs. With the newer generation of coronary stent, this technique seemed safe, feasible and effective to prevent stroke attack, but the indication is very important for the technical success. Restenosis remains a common problem as with coronary stenting. Long-term follow-up will be needed.

84890494682	Impact of atorvastain on carotid atherosclerotic stenosis assessed with ultrasound	Objective: To assess the impact of atorvastatin on carotid atherosclerotic stenosis with color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI). Methods: A total of 52 patients who were first diagnosed as moderate unilateral carotid atherosclerotic stenosis (stenosis rate, 50-69%) at the Department of Vascular Ultrasound, Beijing Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University from January 2007 to December 2010 were enrolled in this study. All the patients were examined once every 6 months and were continuously observed for at least 2.5 years. According to whether taking atorvastatin regularly or not (20 mg/night), the patients were divided into either regular medication group (group A, n = 21) or irregular medication group (group B, n = 31). The differences in changes of intimal medial thickness common carotid artery (CCA-IMT), responsible plaque thickness (RPT) of stenosis were compared between the two groups. Results: Circled digit oneCompared to the first examination, the IMT in both groups had a tendency of gradually thickening with the significant difference. IMT increased 0.062 mm in 2.5 years in group A and 0.113 mm in group B. Compared to the earlier stage, the increased IMT value in group A had a tendency of decreasing after two years, while group B remained increasing rate. There was significant difference for increased IMT at 2.5 years between the two groups. Circled digit twoThe RPT values in both groups had a tendency of gradually thickening. Compared to the first examination, there was no significant difference in the RPT thickening values at each stage in group A. In group B, the RPT thickening value at each stage had significant difference compared with the value at the first examination, and also between later stage and earlier stage(except 1.0years vs. 1.5 years, 1.5 years vs. 2.0 years) (P<0.05 or P<0.01). At 2.5 year, RPT in group A increased 0. 560 mm and in group B increased 0.955 mm. Circled digit threeThe changes of CCA-IMT > 0.1 mm and RPT > 0.3 mm were defined as thickening. And the rate of RPT thickening at 2.5 year in group B was significantly higher than that in group A (87.1% [27/31] vs. 57.1% [12/21], P < 0.05). Conclusion: Regular and long-term atorvastatin calcium taken may slow the processes of CCA-IMT and RPT thickening in patients with carotid atherosclerotic stenosis.

84898416411	Comparison between outcomes of carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting in treating elderly patients	Objective To review the clinical data of elderly patients treated by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS), and analyze the safety of two kinds of surgery. Methods A total of 691 patients with carotid artery stenosis underwent CEA (121 cases) and CAS (570 cases) respectively. The risk factors, clinical symptoms and postoperative complications in 2 groups of patients were analyzed, and the safety of two kinds of surgery were assessed. Results After 30 d of operation, no significant difference was found between 2 groups in death rate (0.83% vs 1.05%, P = 1.000), stroke rate (4.13% vs 1.93% , P = 0.258) or myocardial infarction rate (0.83% vs 0, P = 0.175). Heart complications and cranial nerve injury rate in CEA group was significantly higher than that in CAS group (8.26% vs 1.05%, P = 0.000; 4.96% vs 0, P = 0.000), while sinus bradycardia or hypotension rate in CEA group was significantly lower than that in CAS group (0 vs 7.54%, P = 0.002). Conclusions Both CEA and CAS are safe for the elderly patients. However, the conditions of elderly patients should be evaluated before operation in order to reduce occurence of complications after operation.

84898483492	Analysis of the risk factors of severe hemodynamic depression in carotid stenosis stenting	Objective: To analyze the risk factors of severe hemodynamic depression (HD) in carotid artery stenting (CAS) for the treatment of carotid stenosis. Methods: Eighty-five patients (70 males and 15 females) treated with CAS were analyzed retrospectively. They were divided into either a severe HD group (n = 18) or a non-severe HD group (n = 67) according to whether they had severe HD (blood pressure ≤90/60 mm Hg or heart rate ≤50/min) or not. The effects of all relevant factors on severe HD were observed, and Logistic regression analysis was used to define the independent risk factors for severe HD. Results: Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed the hyperechoic plaques of color Doppler flow imaging (OR = 6.219,95% CI 1.163-33.266;P = 0.033) ,the distance from the most stenotic site to carotid bifurcation <1 cm (OR = 8.360,95% CI 1.372-50.930; P = 0.021), the baseline systolic pressure <120 mm Hg (OR = 6.384,95% CI 1.217-33.486; P = 0.028), and the dilatation of balloon diameter ≥5 mm (OR = 8.028,95% CI 1.462-44.091; P = 0.017) were the independent risk factors for severe HD after CAS. Conclusion: The hyperechoic plaques, distance from the most stenotic site to carotid bifurcation <1 cm, baseline systolic pressure <120 mm Hg,and dilatation balloon diameter ≥5 mm are the independent risk factors for severe HD after CAS.

84902795739	Anomalous origin of bilateral vertebral arteries from the ICA: Review of the literature and a case report	Atypical origins of the vertebral arteries (VAs) are rare anatomic findings. In this study, we present an extremely rare arrangement of the cerebral circulation in a 72-year-old male patient. The anatomic rarity, which was detected using ultrasonic imaging, involved the bilateral VAs coming off the internal carotid arteries (ICAs). Because the ICA and VA on the left side were severely stenotic, the vascular surgeons performed carotid and vertebral endarterectomy simultaneously. Although stenosis can be eliminated from these arteries, this type of rare anatomy results in more difficulties and risks for the patient. Ultrasound imaging provides high anatomic detail during this unique operation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84908661805	Influencing factors of the process of severe middle cerebral artery stenosis	Objectives: To dynamically observe the changes of hemodynamic parameters in patients with severe stenosis of unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) and to evaluate and analyze the related factors for influencing the stenotic process. Methods: A total of 113 consecutive patients with severe stenosis of unilateral MCA screened by TCD and confirmed by computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were enrolled retrospectively. They were divided into either a progressive group (n = 43) or a non-progressive group (n =90) according to the variation of MCA hemodynamic parameters. The effects of age, sex, major risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, clinical symptoms, clinical medication, and drug compliance on the stenotic process were documented and analyzed. Results: (1) The comparison of detection rate of the risk factors for cerebrovascular disease: The patients with a history of smoking (72.1% [n = 31]) in the progressive group was significantly higher than that (51.1%[n=46]) in the non-progressive group (P = 0.022). The period of smoking of the patients in the progressive group were longer than that in the non-progressive group (28 ± 12years vs. 21 ± 10years,P = 0.011). (2) Comparison of MCA hemodynamic parameters;The distal pulsatility indexes of MCA stenosis at the first diagnosis in the progressive group were all lower than those in the non-progressive group (0.66 ±0.10 vs. 0.70 ±0.13 ;t = -2.096,P =0.038),and the distal pulsatility indexes of MCA stenosis at the end point in the patients of the progressive group were lower than those in the non-progressive group (0.61 ±0.15 vs..0.74 ±0.15).There were significant differences (t = -2.718,P = 0.008). The peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the progressive MCA stenotic segments at the end point in 10 patients of the progressive group was higher than that in the non-progressive group (299 ± 23cm/s vs. 244 ±50 cm/s,i =3.437 ;P =0.001) .while PSV of MCA in 33 patients with occlusion in the progressive group were significantly lower than those in the non-progressive group (56 ± 18 cm/s vs. 244 ±50 cm/s,t= - 20.905; P = 0.000) .

11344282308	Relation of transient ischemic attack with decreased regional cerebral blood flow and vascular factors	Aim: To study the relation between multiple factors of vascular lesion and the decrease of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) at the interval of transient ischemic attact (TIA). Methods: Fifty-six TIA patients hospitalized in the Department of Neurology, Xuanwu Hospital from June 2001 to July 2002 were examined by single photon emission computerized tomography(SPECT), transcranial Doppler(TCD) and color-coded Doppler sonography(CCDS), and correlation analysis was done. Results: The order of vascular factors related to TIA was cerebral atherosclerosis(73.3%), carotid artery plaque number(69.2%), carotid artery plaque which was easily shed(23.2%) and intracranial or extracranial vascular stenosis(19.0%). There was significant difference between the elders and non-elders for these factors, with a pattern of closer relation for the former. Conclusion: The major factors of TIA are atherosclerosis, intracranial or extracranial vascular stenosis, and number and quality of carotid artery plaque. Incidence of intracranial atherosclerosis and vascular stenosis is higher than that of extracranial atherosclerosis and vascular stenosis.

84922363512	Multicenter ultrasound screening for the results of carotid atherosclerotic lesions in a Chinese population with high-risk of stroke: A preliminary analysis	Objectives: To screen the high-risk population of stroke in China using color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) and to establish a stroke risk prediction model in Chinese population in order to prevent and treat stroke early. Methods: Forty-one base hospitals and 715 286 people in the project areas of the first 6 provinces of China conducted routine physical examinations and investigated the related risk factors for cardiocerebrovascular diseases from July 2011 to April 2012 using a cross-sectional study, among them 61 860 patients underwent carotid CDFI screening, and 49 386 of them were high-risk population (exposed to ≥3 risk factors). The bilateral common carotid interma-media thickness (IMT), the number of plaques and the degree of carotid stenosis were screened and documented. And whether carotid IMT thickening or not, with or without carotid plaques, and degree of carotid artery stenotic rate 0-49% and ≥50% were performed by multivariate logistic regression analysis with the risk factors for stroke, respectively. Results: (1) Logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension, atrial fibrillation, smoking, and lack of physical exercise were the independent risk factors for carotid IMT thickening (hypertension: OR, 1.17; 95% CI 1.12-1.22; atrial fibrillation: OR, 1.15;95% CT 1.09-1.21; smoking: OR, 1.13;95% CT 1.08 - 1.17; and lack of physical exercise: OR, 1.12; 95% CT 1.08-1.16). (2) Hypertension, atrial fibrillation, smoking, and diabetes were the independent risk factors for carotid plaque and carotid artery stenosis rate ≥ 50% (carotid plaque, hypertension; OR, 1.55; 95% CI 1.47 - 1.62; atrial fibrillation: OR, 1.13; 95% CI 1.06-1.21; smoking: OR, 1.16; 95% CI 1.11-1.22; and diabetes; OR, 1.30; 95% CT 1.24-1.37). Carotid stenosis rate 3=50%, hypertension: OR, 1.78;95% CT 1.55-2.03; atrial fibrillation: OR, 1.59;95% CT 1.39 - 1.81;smoking: OR, 1.33;95%CI 1.20-1.48;and diabetes: OR, 1.30;95% CT 1.17-1.45. Simple obesity did not increase the incidences of carotid atherosclerotic plaque and carotid artery stenosis 3:50% (OR, 0.78, 0.83;95% CI 0.75-0.82, 0.75-0.92, respectively). Conclusions Neck vascular ultrasound can be used as a valuable means for screening high-risk population and detecting risk factors of stroke. It has an important clinical significance for the early diagnosis and treatment of carotid atherosclerosis disease.
