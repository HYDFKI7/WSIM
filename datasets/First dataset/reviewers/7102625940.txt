2442535045	ROS-related enzyme expressions in endothelial cells regulated by tea polyphenols	Objective: Elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially the level of superoxide is a key event in many forms of cardiovascular diseases. To study the mechanism of tea polyphenols against cardiovascular diseases, we observed the expressions of ROS-related enzymes in endothelial cells. Methods: Tea polyphenols were co-incubated with bovine carotid artery endothelial cells (BCAECs) in vitro and intracellular NADPH oxidase subunits p22phox and p67phox, SOD-1, and catalase protein were detected using Western blot method. Results: Tea polyphenols of 0.4 μg/mL and 4.0 μg/mL (from either green tea or black tea) down-regulated NADPH oxidase p22phox and p67phox expressions in a dose-negative manner (P<0.05), and up-regulated the expressions of catalase (P<0.05). Conclusions: Tea polyphenols regulate the enzymes involved in ROS production and elimination in endothelial cells, and may be beneficial to the prevention of endothelial cell dysfunction and the development of cardiovascular diseases.

23844456657	CYP2E1-dependent hepatotoxicity and oxidative damage after ethanol administration in human primary hepatocytes	Aim: To observe the relationship between ethanol-induced oxidative damage in human primary cultured hepatocytes and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) activity, in order to address if inhibition of CYP2E1 could attenuate ethanol-induced cellular damage. Methods: The dose-dependent (25-100 mmol/L) and time-dependent (0-24 h) exposures of primary human cultured hepatocytes to ethanol were carried out. CYP2E1 activity and protein expression were detected by spectrophotometer and Western blot analysis respectively. Hepatotoxicity was investigated by determination of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate transaminase (AST) level in hepatocyte culture supernatants, as well as the intracellular formation of malondialdehyde (MDA). Results: A dose-and time-dependent response between ethanol exposure and CYP2E1 activity in human hepatocytes was demonstrated. Moreover, there was a time-dependent increase of CYP2E1 protein after 100 mmol/L ethanol exposure. Meanwhile, ethanol exposure of hepatocytes caused a time-dependent increase of cellular MDA level, LDH, and AST activities in supernatants. Furthermore, the inhibitor of CYP2E1, diallyl sulfide (DAS) could partly attenuate the increases of MDA, LDH, and AST in human hepatocytes. Conclusion: A positive relationship between ethanol-induced oxidative damage in human primary cultured hepatocytes and CYP2E1 activity was exhibited, and the inhibition of CYP2E1 could partly attenuate ethanol-induced oxidative damage. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

33746021379	A natural sweetener, Momordica grosvenori, attenuates the imbalance of cellular immune functions in alloxan-induced diabetic mice	Momordica grosvenori (MG), a traditional medicinal herb in China used as a substitute sugar for obese and diabetic patients, exhibited an enhancement of immunity. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is among the acute phase proteins that play an important role in the inflammatory process and have antiinflammatory activities with their antioxidant properties. The hypothesis that MG could modulate an imbalance of the cellular immune system and prevent the progression of diabetes mellitus, via induction of HO-1 protein expression was investigated. Diabetes was induced in male Balb/c mice by intraperitoneal injection of alloxan (200 mg/kg). The mice were randomly assigned to non-diabetic and diabetic groups, and further subdivided according to their treatments: control (distilled water), low dose MG (150 mg/kg) and high dose MG (300 mg/kg), which were administered by gavage in 24 h cycles over a 30 day period. MG administration effectively regulated the immune imbalance in diabetic mice, principally by upregulating the CD4

33748059215	Oxidative damage after chronic ethanol intake in rat tissues: Prophylaxis of Ginkgo biloba extract	The prophylactic effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGB) on ethanol-induced oxidative stress in various tissues was evaluated by determining an antioxidative parameter and lipid peroxidation in liver, heart, kidney and testes. Chronic ethanol treatment (2.4 g g/kg, orally for 90 days), for male Sprague-Dawley rats, induced a significant depletion of glutathione (GSH), increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and inactivation of antioxidative enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT), in all measured tissues, except renal SOD and cardiac CAT. In contrast, low or high EGB pre-administration (48 and 96 mg/kg, respectively), especially a high EGB supplement, partly reversed these alterations resulting from chronic ethanol treatment, although changed parameters could not return completely to the normal range. These results showed that EGB could provide protection against ethanol-induced oxidative stress on various tissues. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33847091174	Effect of Momordica grosvenori on oxidative stress pathways in renal mitochondria of normal and alloxan-induced diabetic mice: Involvement of heme oxygenase-1	Background: Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Momordica grosvenori (MG), a traditional medicinal herb used as substitute sugar for obese and diabetes, exhibits anti-oxidative activity in vitro. Aim of the study: This study investigated the effect of MG on renal mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, anti-oxidative defense system, and a potent oxidative stress-responsive protein, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) of non-diabetic and alloxan-diabetic mice in different stages of diabetes. Methods: Male Balb/c mice were rendered diabetic by a single intra-peritoneal injection of alloxan (200 mg/kg), while control mice received sham saline injection. Control and diabetic mice were further subdivided according to their treatments: control (saline), low dose MG (150 mg/kg) and high dose MG (300 mg/kg), which were administered immediately after confirmation of hyperglycemia by gavage daily over an 8-week period. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation at 4th and 8th week, respectively, and serum and renal tissues were harvested. Serum glucose, lipid profile and renal function were evaluated; renal homogenate were subjected to determination of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) concentration, manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and HO-1 activities, together with Mn-SOD and HO-1 mRNA expression; paraffin-embedded renal tissues was used for routine histopathological examination. Results: Short-term diabetes caused hyperglycemia and intensified oxidative stress in renal mitochondrial demonstrated by higher MDA and lower GSH levels than control group, accompanied by increased mRNA expression and activity of HO-1 and Mn-SOD, and augmented GSH-Px activity. Low dose of MG administration ameliorated hyperglycemia, inhibited HO-1 and Mn-SOD mRNA expression and reduced HO-1, Mn-SOD, GSH-Px activities. Diabetic mice did not demonstrate early symptoms of diabetic nephropathy until 8th week, characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and renal damage. A progressive increment in MDA level and decrease in GSH level, as well as reduced mRNA expression and activity of Mn-SOD and HO-1 in the kidney were observed. Low dose of MG attenuated diabetic nephropathy symptoms partially, inhibited lipid peroxidation, up-regulated HO-1 and Mn-SOD mRNA expression, and increased HO-1 activity. Conclusions: The study confirmed the involvement of oxidative stress in the development of diabetes mediated by the pro- and anti-oxidant role of HO-1, and pointed to the possible anti-oxidative mechanism of the anti-diabetic and nephroprotective action of MG. © 2007 Steinkopff Verlag.

34447134884	Heme oxygenase-1 upregulated by Ginkgo biloba extract: Potential protection against ethanol-induced oxidative liver damage	Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and HO-1 induction is suggested to protect hepatocytes from ethanol hepatotoxicity. Here, we present the data to explore the hepatoprotective effect and underlying mechanism(s) of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGB), a naturally occurring HO-1 inducer, against ethanol-induced oxidative damage. Ethanol-fed (2.4 g/kg) male rats were pretreated by EGB (48 or 96 mg/kg) for 90 days. Liver damage was evaluated by histopathology and serum aminotransferase assay. Hepatic redox parameters were measured by spectrophotometry. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression was determined by RT-PCR and flow cytometry on mRNA and protein level, respectively. Our results showed that EGB, especially at high dose, ameliorated ethanol-induced macrovesicular steatosis and parenchymatous degeneration in hepatocytes, and decreased serum aminotransferases level. Furthermore, EGB reduced ethanol-derived glutathione depletion and lipid peroxidation, and inhibited the inactivation of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase, although EGB itself had no influence on such parameters. Importantly, EGB induced hepatic microsomal HO-1 on mRNA, protein expression and enzymatic activity, which is paralleled to the EGB-derived hepatoprotective effect. Hence, HO-1 upregulation by EGB may enhance the antioxidative capacity against the ethanol-induced oxidative stress and maintain the cellular redox balance. © 2007.

34347392509	Quercetin protects human hepatocytes from ethanol-derived oxidative stress by inducing heme oxygenase-1 via the MAPK/Nrf2 pathways	Background/Aims: Flavonoids, including quercetin, have been reported to have potent hepatoprotective effects, which may be associated with HO-1 induction. However, since the effect and signaling pathway of quercetin involved in HO-1 induction against alcoholic liver damage are still not fully understood, this is the target of the present study. Methods: Human hepatocytes were incubated with ethanol (100 mM) and quercetin (10-200 μM), and cellular damage and HO-1 activity were measured. Nrf2 expression in cytosolic and nuclear fractions was studied following the incubation with MAPK inhibitor(s). Results: Ethanol exposure resulted in a sustained glutathione depletion, malondialdehyde elevation, and evident release of cellular LDH and AST. Quercetin exerted a dose-dependent protective effect against alcoholic oxidative stress, and increased the EC50 of ethanol by approx. 40%, which is parallel to HO-1 induction with quercetin. Zinc protoporphyrin-9 abrogated the protective effect and dramatically enhanced ethanol cytotoxicity. SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and especially PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) blocked quercetin-derived HO-1 induction and Nrf2 translocation, and subsequently inhibited the quercetin-related protection. Conclusions: HO-1 up-regulation by quercetin protected human hepatocytes from ethanol-induced oxidative stress. Among MAPK signaling pathways, p38 and ERK mediated quercetin-derived Nrf2 translocation into nuclei and subsequent induction of HO-1 activity, and the latter showed a stronger mediating effect. © 2007 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

34548177008	Ginkgo biloba extract prevents ethanol induced dyslipidemia	Ginkgo biloba extract (EGB) functions as a natural substantial antioxidant and hypolipidemic. Chronic alcohol abuse leads to sustained dyslipidemia characterized by hyperlipidemia and lipid peroxidation. Thus, the present study investigates the effect of EGB on lipid disorders induced by ethanol in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with ethanol (2.4 g/kg), and pretreated with a daily dose of low or high EGB (48 or 96 mg/kg, respectively). During the experiment, serum was collected on day 30, 60, and 90. Serum lipid profile, including lipid peroxidation, was determined by colorimetric methods. Our data showed that ethanol intake resulted in a time-dependent increase in serum levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and a decrease of the ratio of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) against TC. EGB prophylactic medication (48 and 96 mg/kg), especially at the high dose, significantly increased HDL-C content, and normalized the abnormal lipid profile and peroxidation in comparison to ethanol-fed only rats. These results suggest that ethanol results in time-dependent hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and promotes serum lipid peroxidation. EGB pretreatment prevents hyperlipidemia and ameliorates lipid peroxidation induced by ethanol. © 2007 World Scientific Publishing Company Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Science and Medicine.

0033500007	The efficacy of cerebrolysin in patients with vascular dementia: Results of a Chinese multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial	Objectives: Cerebrolysin is a nootropic drug that directly affects cerebral neurons due to its unique neurotrophic activities. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of cerebrolysin in patients with mild to moderately severe vascular dementia. Methods: The trial was a multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group design. 148 patients aged 55 to 85 years were randomised to treatment with either cerebrolysin 30 ml or placebo intravenous infusion once daily from Monday to Friday for four weeks. The results were assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Clinical Global Impression, the Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric, the Hamilton Depression Scale, the Nuremberg Activities Inventory, the Activities of Daily Living Scale and the modified Trail Making Test. Results: Patients treated with cerebrolysin showed statistically significant improvement in Mini-Mental State Examination scores and the modified Trail Making Test at the end of treatment compared with patients treated with placebo. The Mini-Mental State Examination score was raised by 2.7 points from baseline in patients treated with cerebrolysin. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events with cerebrolysin was low (5%) and comparable to that observed with placebo (8%). Conclusion: Cerebrolysin leads to fast and clinically relevant improvement in some areas of cognitive function in patients with vascular dementia. There were no significant side effects observed during cerebrolysin treatment.

38849204371	The protective effects of in vitro cultivated calculus bovis on the cerebral and myocardial cells in hypoxic mice	The protective effects of in vitro cultivated calculus bovis (ICCB) on the cerebral and myocardial cells in hypoxic mice and the mechanism were examined. In one group, mice were intragastrically (i.g.) given ICCB for 15 days and then they were subjected to acute cerebral ischemia by decapitation, and then the panting time was recorded. In the other group, 12 min after exposure to hypoxia, mice was administered the ICCB i.g. for 5 days, and then the blood serum and tissues of brain, heart, liver were harvested and examined for SOD, GSH-px and T-AOC activity and content of MDA. The tissues of brain and heart were observed electron-microscopically for ultrastructural changes. The corpus striatum and hippocampus of brain were collected and examined for content of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). The ultrastrural examination showed that the pathological change in brain and heart in the ICCB group was very slight, while abnormal changes in the control group were obviously more serious. ICCB significantly prolonged the panting time of the hypoxic mice (P<0.001), increased the activity of SOD, GSH-px, T-AOC in serum and tissues of brain, liver, heart and elevated the content of DA and NE. ICCB also pronouncedly reduced content of MDA in serum and tissues of brain, heart and liver. Significant differences in these parameters were noted between ICCB group and controls. It is concluded that ICCB can exert protective effect on the cells of brain and myocardium by enhancing the tolerance of the tissues to hypoxia and the body's ability to remove free radicals and regulating the neurotransmitters. © 2008 Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

77954660465	Suppression of retinoic acid receptors may contribute to embryonic skeleton hypoplasia in maternal rats with chronic vitamin A deficiency	Vitamin A (VA) is essential for embryonic development and the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) are crucial in mediating the diverse actions of VA in embryogenesis. However, the association between RARs and teratogenicity on skeleton growth and development of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is not clear. In this present study, weaning female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed purified diets containing graded levels of VA (0, 0.4, 4 IU/g diet) for 70 days before mating, and some of them were supplemented with VA (10 IU/g diet) through pregnancy. Embryos were recovered at embryonic day 19.5 (E19.5) for the analysis of skeleton growth and development and the E12.5 embryos were collected for analysis of select mRNA of RARα, RARβ, RARγ, Hoxa2, Hoxa5 and Hoxa9. Normal gene expressions and morphogenesis were observed in all embryos from group fed 4 IU/g diet. The embryos from group fed VA-free diet showed a comprehensive suppression of all the genes and general fetal resorption. The embryos from group fed 0.4 IU/g diet exhibited a moderate down-regulation on RARβ, RARγ, Hoxa2 and Hoxa5, and the E19.5 fetuses displayed a series of skeletal hypoplasia. The VA supplement groups fed 10 IU/g diet displayed normal gene expressions and morphologic appearances. These findings suggested that the suppression of RARs resulted from VAD could disturb the proper expression of homeobox genes, which might, at least in part, contribute to the embryonic skeletal hypoplasia due to maternal rats with chronic VAD. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

79951847362	Changes in the nitric oxide system contribute to effect of procyanidins extracted from the lotus seedpod ameliorating memory impairment in cognitively impaired aged rats	The major purpose of this study was to determine the effect of procyanidins extracted from the lotus seedpod (LSPC) on the nitric oxide (NO) system in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex in cognitively impaired aged rats. Using the Morris water maze, aged-unimpaired (AU) and aged-impaired (AI) rats were chosen from aged rats. All aged rats exhibited elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activities and decreased neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activities in the both brain regions. The changes were more pronounced in the brain of AI rats, especially in the hippocampus. Furthermore, AI rats greatly lowed the percentage of change of hippocampal nNOS activity in the presence of protein kinase inhibitors or phosphatase inhibitor, which meant that AI animals existed in a hardly modified nNOS dephosphorylated state in hippocampus. LSPC supplementation [50, 100mg/kg of body weight (BW), per os (p.o.)] for 7 weeks significantly decreased iNOS activities and improved hippocampal nNOS phosphorylation status in AI animals. These results suggested that changes in the NO system may involve in the ameliorative effects of LSPC on cognitive deficits in AI animals. © 2011 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

Methods: Three hundred sixty-two children intwo kindergartens in Wuhan China were enrolled. Detailed dietary assessment and anthropometry were undertaken to facilitate the exclusion of malnourished children. Seventy vitamin A-deficient children with informed consent were randomly divided into the vitamin A-deficient-supplemented group and vitamin A-deficient placebo group, 35 vitamin A-sufficient children (age- and sex-matched with the vitamin A-deficient-supplemented group children) were selected as vitamin A-sufficient placebo group. The baseline and follow-up level of selected immune parameters of the 105 children in three intervention groups were compared. Results: The total proportion of severe and marginal vitamin A-deficient children was 10.9 and 21.96%, respectively. At baseline, the serum complement C3 and sIgA level of vitamin A-sufficient children was significantly higher than that of vitamin A-deficient children (P<0.05). However, the serum lysozyme level of vitamin A-sufficient children was inversely lower. After intervention, vitamin A-deficient-supplemented children increased serum vitamin A, complement C3 and sIgA level, but their serum lysozyme level inversely decreased. Conclusions: Vitamin A deficiency was still a serious health problem in children in China cities. Vitamin A supplementation was efficacious in ameliorating serum vitamin A status and partially impaired immune function of well-nourished children suffering from vitamin A deficiency.

60349116278	The effect of health and nutrition education intervention on women's postpartum beliefs and practices: A randomized controlled trial	Background. 'Sitting month' is the Chinese tradition for postpartum customs. Available studies indicate that some of the traditional postpartum practices are potentially harmful for women's health. However, no intervention study aiming at postpartum practices has been performed. In this paper we evaluated the effect of a health and nutrition education intervention, which focused on improving postpartum dietary quality and optimal health behaviors. Methods. The study design was a randomized controlled trial conducted in both urban and rural area of Hubei between August 2003 and June 2004. A total of 302 women who attended the antenatal clinic during the third trimester with an uncomplicated pregnancy were recruited. Women randomized to the education intervention group in both urban and rural area received two two-hour prenatal education sessions and four postpartum counseling visits. Control group women received usual health care during pregnancy and postpartum period. Women were followed up until 42 days postpartum. Outcome measures were nutrition and health knowledge, dietary behavior, health behavior and health problems during the postpartum period. Results. Women in the intervention groups exhibited significantly greater improvement in overall dietary behaviors such as consumption of fruits, vegetables, soybean and soybean products as well as nutrition and health knowledge than those in the control groups. Significantly more women in the intervention groups give up the traditional behavior taboos. The incidence of constipation, leg cramp or joint pain and prolonged lochia rubra was significantly lower in the intervention groups as compared with the control groups. Conclusion. The study shows that health and nutrition education intervention enable the women take away some of the unhealthy traditional postpartum practices and decrease the prevalence of postpartum health problems. The intervention has potential for adaptation and development to large-scale implementation. Trial registration number. klACTRN12607000549426. © 2009 Liu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

65649145150	Association between C-reactive protein and pre-diabetic status in a Chinese Han clinical population	Background: C-reactive protein (CRP) has been showed to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but whether CRP underlies glucose disorders in Asian people is still unclear, for they have much lower body mass index (BMI) levels than these Westerns in previous studies. Method: In this clinical-based cross-sectional study, the association between CRP and hyperglycaemia in different BMI levels and different gender was compared among 1730 Chinese Han men and women, including 1258 subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 126 subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and 346 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Subjects with isolated IFG or IGT were all newly diagnosed and did not use anti-diabetic drugs. Results: Compared with subjects with NGT, BMI, fasting blood glucose, homoeostatis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and serum CRP levels were increased in subjects with IGT and IFG. In stratified analyses, increasing CRP levels were strongly associated with prevalence of IGT and IFG in different BMI strata. After adjustment for sex, age, BMI, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, hypertension status, recreational physical activity and occupational physical activity, the ORs across quartiles of CRP were 1.00, 1.43, 2.14 and 2.29 for IFG (P for trend: 0.025) and 1.00, 1.85, 2.32 and 2.79 for IGT (P for trend: 0.012). Conclusion: These results support the hypothesis that chronic inflammation may be involved in the development of hyperglycaemia, even though in a thinner and healthy population.

67049145006	The protective role of HO-1 and its generated products (CO, bilirubin, and Fe) in ethanol-induced human hepatocyte damage	It has been reported that naturally occurring quercetin exerts hepatoprotective effects through heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction. However, the precise mechanism of how ethanol-associated liver damage is counteracted by quercetin-enhanced HO-1 metabolism still remains unclear. To further decipher the protective role of quercetin on ethanolinduced liver damage, we treated human hepatocytes with quercetin and various (end) products of the HO-1 pathway. Our data clearly showed that quercetin treatment attenuated ethanol-induced damage, whereas hemoglobin and zinc protoporphyrin 9 (ZnPP) abolished such effects. Iron-II aggravated ethanol toxicity and was only partially reduced by quercetin. In contrast, carbon monoxide (CO) dose dependently inhibited ethanol-induced cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP 2E1) activity and hepatotoxicity but had no influence on CYP 2E1 protein expression. Similarly, hemoglobin dramatically stimulated CYP 2E1 activity but not the protein expression in quercetin- and ethanol-cotreated hepatocytes. ZnPP significantly promoted CYP 2E1 protein expression in the presence and absence of CO treatment but inhibited ethanol-induced CYP 2E1 activation following CO incubation in quercetin- and ethanol-cotreated hepatocytes. These results suggested that quercetin virtually attenuated ethanol-derived oxidative damage via HO-1 induction. Heme degradation and CO release may mediate the protective effects through inhibiting ethanol-induced CYP 2E1 synthesis and enzymatic activity, respectively.

67349125377	Effect of beta-carotene supplementation on health and growth of vitamin A deficient children in China rural villages: A randomized controlled trial	Aims: To examine whether beta-carotene supplementation had a similar effect on vitamin A deficient children as retinol supplementation. Methods: The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. It was divided into two parts including surveying and intervening stages. 225 children in two villages in rural China were surveyed and 132 vitamin A deficient children included were randomly divided into retinol intervening group, beta-carotene intervening group and placebo group. Detailed dietary assessment and physical examination were evaluated. The baseline and follow-up serum vitamin A level of the children in the three intervention groups were compared. Results: The total proportion of severe and marginal vitamin A deficient children was 23.1% and 44.4%, respectively. After intervention, children with retinol and beta-carotene supplementation significantly increased serum vitamin A level (p < 0.001). The morbidity days of children with retinol and beta-carotene supplementation were significantly less than of children given placebo (p < 0.05). The mean increased value of weight of vitamin A and beta-carotene intervening groups was both significantly higher than placebo group (p < 0.05). No significant difference in increased value of height was observed between the three intervening groups. Conclusions: We found that beta-carotene supplementation had a similar effect on correcting childhood vitamin A deficiency as retinol supplementation. Considering the health risk of vitamin A supplementation and the easier acquisition and antioxidant value of dietary beta-carotene, we recommended dietary beta-carotene supplementation for intervening high prevalent of children vitamin A deficiency in China rural areas. © 2008.

A Chinese case-control study involving 1,103 newly diagnosed T2DM patients, 371 patients with impaired glucose regulation (IGR), and 1,615 controls was performed (December 2004-December 2007). A (GT)n microsatellite polymorphism and a single nucleotide polymorphism, T(-413)A, were genotyped, and their functional relevance was evaluated by examining the level of HO-1 protein expression. For the (GT)n microsatellite polymorphism, genotypes with the L (GT)n allele (≥25 GT repeats) were associated with increased odds of IGR or T2DM compared with the S/S genotype (<25 GT repeats) (S/L genotype: odds ratio (OR)=1.35, P=0.048; L/L genotype: OR=1.65, P=0.006). Subsequent haplotype analysis showed that haplotype TL contributed to increased odds of IGR or T2DM compared with haplotype TS (OR=1.56, P=0.003). In functional analyses, HO-1 expression level was significantly reduced in persons with IGR and T2DM carrying the L/L (GT)n genotype compared with persons with the S/S genotype. Further haplotype combination assay confirmed the functional dominance of the (GT)n microsatellite polymorphism over the T(-413)A single nucleotide polymorphism. These results support an association between the HO-1 (GT)n microsatellite polymorphism, HO-1 expression levels, and the odds of T2DM.

70350413815	Rejuvenation of antioxidant and cholinergic systems contributes to the effect of procyanidins extracted from the lotus seedpod ameliorating memory impairment in cognitively impaired aged rats	The major purpose of this study was to determine the effect of procyanidins extracted from the lotus seedpod (LSPC) on the learning and memory impairments in cognitively impaired aged rats. Based on Morris water maze performance compared with young female rats, aged unimpaired (AU) and aged impaired (AI) rats were chosen from aged female rats. LSPC supplementation (50, 100 mg/kg BW, p.o.) for 7 weeks significantly improved learning and memory impairments in AI animals in the Morris water maze test, as evaluated by shortened escape latency and swimming distance. Aged rats had significantly declined antioxidant defense capacities and significantly increased lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation levels in hippocampus and cerebral cortex than young rats. Further, AI group had higher protein oxidation level compared with AU group. LSPC (50, 100 mg/kg BW, p.o.) significantly reversed the decline of antioxidant defense capacities and significantly reduced lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation levels in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of AI rats. In addition, LSPC significantly restored acetylcholine (ACh) contents and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of AI animals. The results of this study suggest that LSPC may play a useful role in the treatment of cognitive impairment caused by Alzheimer's disease and aging. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

70450225244	Comparison of risk factors associated with hypertension subtypes by classification tree method in tongshan county of jiangsu province, China	Background There are only a very limited number of studies relating to risk factors for hypertension in rural populations in China. There are even fewer studies comparing various hypertension subtypes.MethodsA cross-sectional investigation was carried out in a representative sample of 20,390 subjects drawn from among 1,180,000 adult residents of Tongshan County of Jiangsu Province, China. The impact of risk factors including demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and behavioral, on three hypertension subtypes, namely, isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), and systolic-diastolic hypertension (SDH), was analyzed by applying statistical tests and a classification tree.ResultsISH was the predominant untreated hypertension subtype (13.68 0.24%) in the adults of Tongshan County, followed by SDH (11.70 0.23%) and IDH (6.24 0.17%). Age, number of cigarettes smoked daily, and the types of vitamins taken varied among the ISH, IDH, and SDH classification trees. Low socioeconomic status was associated with an increased risk for ISH and SDH. Light alcohol intake was associated with higher risk for ISH, but with lower risks for IDH and SDH. Light cigarette smoking was associated with higher ISH risk but lower SDH risk. The intake of appropriate amounts of fish, shrimp, or meat lowered the risks for ISH and IDH. The intake of appropriate amounts of seafood, eggs, milk, or fruit lowered the risks for all hypertension subtypes. Interestingly, an excessive preference for sweet or salty foods was associated with a higher risk for all the subtypes.ConclusionsIn Tongshan County, there was a considerable prevalence of hypertension of various subtypes, each associated with distinctive and complex risk factors. This suggests that there is a need for testing more diverse prevention measures, tailored to specific subtypes. © 2009 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

71549140080	Application of hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP) system to vacuum-packed sauced pork in Chinese food corporations	Our study aims to establish an HACCP system which was implemented for the quality assurance of vacuum-packed sauced pork processing in Chinese food corporations. After identified hazards, the critical control points were defined using a decision tree. In addition, the vacuum-packed sauced pork products, manufactured by three corporations, were detected for chemical and microbial contaminants before and after the implementation of the HACCP system, respectively. According to the national food hygiene standards accepted by PR China, for nitrite, aerobic plate count and coliforms, the percentage of products obtained before vs. after the implementation of HACCP satisfying the standards was 86.2% vs. 100%, 71.3% vs. 96.4% and 71.3% vs. 95.5%, respectively. In conclusion, the contaminants of vacuum-packed sauced pork can be reduced or eliminated if an HACCP system is applied effectively. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

73449105086	Procyanidins extracted from the lotus seedpod ameliorate scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mice	The major purpose of this study was to determine the effect of procyanidins extracted from the lotus seedpod (LSPC) on the learning and memory impairments induced by scopolamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) in mice. The capacities of memory and learning were evaluated by the Morris water maze and the step-down avoidance test. LSPC (50, 100, 150 mg/kg BW, p.o.) significantly reversed scopolamine-induced learning and memory impairments in the Morris water maze test, as evaluated by shortened escape latency and swimming distance. In the step-down avoidance test, LSPC (50, 100, 150 mg/kg BW, p.o.) treatment significantly reduced the number of errors and shortened latency compared with that of scopolamine. In addition, LSPC was also found to inhibit acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) activity. These results of this study suggest that LSPC may play a useful role in the treatment of cognitive impairment caused by AD and aging. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

76549135006	Quercetin protects against ethanol-induced oxidative damage in rat primary hepatocytes	The pathogenesis and progression of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) are associated with free radical injury and oxidative stress, which could be partially attenuated by antioxidants and free radical scavengers. Quercetin, one of the most widely distributed flavonoids in plants, is a natural antioxidant. The hypothesis that quercetin could prevent the ethanol-induced oxidative damage in hepatocytes was investigated. The ethanol-intoxicated (100 mM for 8 h) rat primary hepatocytes were post-treated (2 h), simultaneously treated or pre-treated (2 h) with quercetin respectively, while the time-dependent (0.5-8 h) and dose-dependent (25-200 μM) quercetin pre-treatment were used in the present study. The parameters of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were determined to address the alterations of cell damage and antioxidant state after quercetin intervention. The toxic insult of ethanol to hepatocytes was challenged by quercetin and these parameters almost returned to the level of control group when hepatocytes were pre-treated with quercetin at the dose of 50 μM for 2-4 h before ethanol exposure. In conclusion, quercetin pre-treatment provided protection against ethanol-induced oxidative stress in hepatocytes and may be used as a new natural drug for the prevention and/or treatment of ALD. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

77649189669	Curcumin alleviates ethanol-induced hepatocytes oxidative damage involving heme oxygenase-1 induction	Ethnopharmacological relevance: Curcumin is the main bioactive constituent derived from the rhizome of turmeric (Curcuma longa Linn.), which has been used traditionally as hepatoprotective agents in ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Aim of the study: The present study was carried out to demonstrate the potential protective effect of curcumin pretreatment against ethanol-induced hepatocytes oxidative damage, with emphasis on heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction. Materials and methods: Rat primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with ethanol (100 mM) and diverse doses of curcumin (0-50 μM), which was pretreated at various time points (0-5 h) before ethanol administration. Hepatic enzyme releases in the culture medium and redox status including HO-1 enzyme activity were detected. Results: Ethanol exposure resulted in a sustained malondialdehyde (MDA) elevation, glutathione (GSH) depletion and evident release of cellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which was significantly ameliorated by curcumin pretreatment. In addition, dose- and time-dependent induction of HO-1 was involved in such hepatoprotective effects by curcumin. Conclusions: Curcumin exerts hepatoprotective properties against ethanol involving HO-1 induction, which provide new insights into the pharmacological targets of curcumin in the prevention of alcoholic liver disease. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77949495487	Procyanidins extracted from the lotus seedpod ameliorate age-related antioxidant deficit in aged rats	The alleviative effect of procyanidins extracted from the lotus seedpod (LSPC) on oxidative stress in various tissues was evaluated by determining the activities of the antioxidant enzymes and the content of reduced glutathione (GSH) in heart, liver, lung, kidney, skeletal muscle, and serum in aged rats. Aging led to antioxidant deficit in various tissues in this study, which is confirmed by remarkable increased lipid peroxidation, whereas the change patterns of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and GSH were diverse in various tissues of aged rats. LSPC treatment (50 and 100 mg/kg body weight) modified the activity of SOD, CAT, and GPx as well as GSH content alteration in these tissues, which reversed the age-related antioxidant deficit in aged rats. However, the regulatory patterns on the activities of these enzymes and GSH content by LSPC treatment were different according to the tissues in aged rats. © The Author 2009.

77950424917	A genetic variation in the fat mass- and obesity-associated gene is associated with obesity and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population	Background: Recently, a genome-wide association study identified a strong association between the fat mass- and obesity-associated rs9939609 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the risk of obesity in European population. However, the results in Chinese population were reported to be contradictory. Therefore, our aim was to examine whether this SNP is associated with obesity and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Chinese population. Methods: We genotyped rs9939609 in 2587 subjects [obesity 243, overweight 976, normal weight 1368 or newly diagnosed T2D 877, impaired glucose regulation 305, normal glucose tolerance (NGT) 1405] using an allelic discrimination assay-by-design TaqMan method on ABI7900HT. We analysed associations of the rs9939609 SNP with obesity and newly diagnosed T2D through Logistic regression analysis. Results: In obesity case - control study, we found that the A allele was strongly associated with obesity and overweight. The odds ratios for the allele A versus T were 1.447 for Obesity versus normal weight (95% CI 1.104-1.896, p = 0.007) and 1.363 for Overweight versus normal weight (95% CI 1.149-1.617, p < 0.0001). In T2D case-control study, the odds ratios for the allele A versus T were 1.305 for T2D versus NGT (95% CI 1.097-1.552, p = 0.003) and 1.280 for combined T2D and impaired glucose regulation (IGR) versus NGT (95% CI 1.089-1.503, p = 0.003). The associations of the A allele with T2D and combined T2D and IGR remained significant with adjustment for age, sex and body mass index (BMI). Conclusion: The fat mass- and obesity-associated gene rs9939609 SNP is strongly associated with risk of obesity and newly diagnosed T2D in the Chinese population.

77955913748	Memory impairment in cognitively impaired aged rats associated with decreased hippocampal CREB phosphorylation: Reversal by procyanidins extracted from the lotus seedpod	The major purpose of this study was to determine the effects of procyanidins extracted from the lotus seedpod on cAMP-response element-binding protein phosphorylation in hippocampus and cerebral cortex in cognitively impaired aged rats. Based on Morris water maze, aged unimpaired and aged impaired rats were chosen from aged rats. Comparing with young and aged unimpaired animals, aged impaired rats exhibited significant reduction in hippocampal but not cortical cAMP-response element-binding phosphorylation states as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA and protein expressions, which were accompanied by decreased phosphorylation states of hippocampal extracellular signal-related kinase (42/44) and calcium calmodulin kinase IV. Lotus seedpod supplementation (50 and 100 mg/kg body weight intragastric administration) for 7 weeks significantly reversed all these declines happened in hippocampus except calcium calmodulin kinase IV phosphorylation levels. These results suggested that lotus seedpod might enhance cAMP-response element-binding-dependent transcription through the activation of extracellular signal-related kinase signalling pathway, which might contribute to its ameliorative effects on cognitive deficits in aged impaired animals. © 2010 The Author.

77957882550	Plasma heme oxygenase-1 concentration is elevated in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus	Background: Circulating concentrations of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) have been recently reported to be elevated in several chronic disorders. However, no study has ever examined the association between circulating HO-1 concentrations and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods and Findings: 581 cases with newly-diagnosed T2DM (New-T2DM) and 611 comparison controls were recruited in this two-phase case-control study, comprising 420 cases and 429 controls collected in the first phase study and 161 cases and 182 controls in the second phase replication study. Analyses, using both separated data and combined data from the two-phase studies, show that plasma HO-1 concentrations were significantly increased in New-T2DM cases compared to controls (P<0.001). Plasma HO-1 concentrations were significantly correlated with plasma glucose concentrations, HOMAbeta and HOMA-IR (P<0.001). After adjustment for age, sex, BMI and family history of diabetes, the ORs for New-T2DM in the highest quartile of plasma HO-1 concentrations, compared with the lowest, was 8.23 (95% CI 5.55-12.21; P for trend <0.001). The trend remained significant after additional adjustment for fasting plasma glucose/insulin, HOMA-beta/HOMAIR, TC/TG, smoking, drinking and history of hypertension, and even in further stratification analysis by age, sex, BMI, smoking, drinking and history of hypertension. Conclusions: Elevated plasma HO-1 concentrations are associated with higher ORs for New-T2DM, which add more knowledge regarding the important role of oxidative stress in T2DM. More consequent studies were warranted to confirm the clinical utility of plasma HO-1, especially in diagnosis and prognosis of T2DM and its complications. 2010 Bao et al.

78951491598	Pu-erh black tea supplementation decreases quinocetone-induced ROS generation and oxidative DNA damage in Balb/c mice	Quinocetone (3-methyl-2-quinoxalinbenzenevinylketo-1,4-dioxide, QCT), a new feed antibacterial agent of quinoxaline-1,4-dioxides family, has been used as an animal growth promoter. However, few data about its potential toxicity in vivo were available. In this study, genotoxicity of QCT and the relationship with oxidative stress were investigated. Balb/c mice with both sexes were administrated with QCT (12000, 6000 and 3000. mg/kg/bw, respectively) by gavage acutely. DNA damage, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activity of antioxidative system (total antioxidative capacity, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase) in liver and kidney were determined. Moreover, Pu-erh black tea extract (BTE) was co-administrated with QCT to evaluate its protective effect against QCT-induced genotoxicity. The DNA damage was observed in all the groups treated with single QCT except the liver with dose of 3000. mg/kg/bw. ROS was accumulated and antioxidative system was suppressed both in liver and kidney. However, the DNA damage, as well as the ROS, was decreased, while the activity of antioxidative system was increased in mice after co-administration of QCT and BTE. These data demonstrate that oxidative stress mediated the genotoxicity induced by QCT in vivo. Furthermore, this oxidative DNA damage can be attenuated by pre-supplementation of BTE. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79955589090	Protective role of HO-1 for alcohol-dependent liver damage	Background/Aims: Alcoholic liver disease is continuously increasing in developed countries being a leading cause of death worldwide. Chronic ethanol consumption induces oxidative stress by accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) while reducing the cellular antioxidant defense. Induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) may protect primary human hepatocytes (hHeps) from such damage. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential of polyphenols to protect hHeps from ethanol-dependent oxidative damage. Methods: hHeps were isolated by collagenase perfusion. ROI and cellular glutathione (GSH) were measured by fluorescent-based assays. Cellular damage was determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and staining for apoptosis and necrosis. Nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression were analyzed by Western blot. Results: Ethanol and TGF-β rapidly increase ROI and reduce GSH in hHeps, causing apoptosis with a release of approximately 40% total LDH after 72 h. Similar to incubation with hemin preincubation and co-incubation of cells with nifedipine, verapamil and quercetin significantly reduce oxidative stress and resulting cellular damage, in a dose-dependent manner, by initiating nuclear translocation of Nrf2 which in turn induces HO-1 under the control of p38 and ERK. Blocking of HO-1 activity with ZNPP9 reverses the protective effect of all three substances. Conclusion: Our results suggest that increasing HO-1 activity in hHeps protects them from oxidative stress-dependent damage. As polyphenols have great potential to induce HO-1 expression, they may play an important role for future therapeutic strategies to protect liver from oxidative stress-dependent damage observed during chronic alcohol consumption.

79958759528	High molecular weight persimmon tannin ameliorates cognition deficits and attenuates oxidative damage in senescent mice induced by d-galactose	Mice were subcutaneously injected with d-galactose (d-gal, 150mg/kg per day) for 6. weeks and were administered high molecular weight persimmon condensed tannin (HMWPT) simultaneously. After 6. weeks of treatment, the animal behavior was observed in the open field test and water maze test, and the morphology of hippocampus and skin were checked. Meanwhile, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, the levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) were evaluated. The results indicated that HMWPT markedly inhibited the d-gal induced learning and memory impairment in both open field test and Morris water maze. Biochemical examination revealed that HMWPT significantly increased the decreased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), elevated the lowered total anti-oxidation capability (T-AOC), glutathione (GSH) and hydroxyproline (Hyp) contents (p< 0.01 or p< 0.05), and decreased the raised monoamine oxidase (MAO), total cholinesterase (TChE) activities and MDA level (p< 0.01) in serum, liver or brain of aging mice induced by d-gal in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, HMWPT significantly and (p< 0.01) attenuated the d-gal induced number decrease, neuronal degeneration and karyopycnosis in cells in the hippocampus and decrease of thickness of skin epidermis and dermis. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84855250005	Pu-erh black tea extract supplementation attenuates the oxidative DNA damage and oxidative stress in Sprague-Dawley rats with renal dysfunction induced by subchronic 3-methyl-2-quinoxalin benzenevinylketo-1,4-dioxide exposure	3-Methyl-2-quinoxalin benzenevinylketo-1,4-dioxide (Quinocetone, QCT), has been used to treat dysentery and promote growth in animal feeding. However, available data show that QCT has potential nephrotoxicity. The present study was designed to investigate the protective effects of Pu-erh black tea extract (PBTE) which is a traditional remedy in China with antioxidant properties against oxidative DNA damage and oxidative stress in a rat model of QCT-induced renal dysfunction. Increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, pathological lesions, urinary 8-hydroxy 2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and renal DNA damage were observed in the QCT-fed rats. These were accompanied by intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, enhanced lipid peroxidation, and inhibited antioxidant system, i.e., glutathione glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. Oral administration of PBTE effectively suppressed QCT-induced renal dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced serum creatinine, urinary 8-OHdG and DNA damage in isolated renal cells, amelioration of oxidative stress and modulation of antioxidative system. In conclusion, PBTE administration ameliorated QCT-induced nephrotoxicity by maintaining DNA's double-helix architecture and mitigating oxidative stress. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84855343368	Heme oxygenase-1 mediates the protective role of quercetin against ethanol-induced rat hepatocytes oxidative damage	Quercetin, one of the most widely distributed flavonoids in plants, possesses strong free radical scavenging ability and potent hepatoprotective effects. However, the protective effect and mechanism of quercetin on ethanol-induced oxidative damage in hepatocytes remain unclear. In this study, primary rat hepatocytes were incubated with ethanol and quercetin in the presence or absence of ZnPP 9, an antagonist of HO-1 induction. The ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity was found to be greatly diminished by pre-treatment of quercetin and this hepatoprotective effect could be partly blocked by ZnPP 9. This study also showed that quercetin significantly stimulated HO-1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, then subsequently induced HO-1 activity. To further study the signaling pathways underlying quercetin-induced HO-1 up-regulation, HO-1 expression and activity in cytosolic microsomal fractions and Nrf2 expression in nuclear fractions were analyzed following quercetin or/and MAPK inhibitor(s) as well as PI3K inhibitor incubation for primary rat hepatocytes. These results indicated that ERK was required to induce HO-1 expression in rat hepatocytes. In summary, these data suggested that quercetin attenuates ethanol-induced oxidative stress through a pathway which involves ERK activation and HO-1 upregulation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84857046972	Quercetin attenuates ethanol-derived microsomal oxidative stress: Implication of haem oxygenase-1 induction	As the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), hepatic microsomes are susceptible to ROS attack, especially upon CYP2E1 activation by ethanol. The objective of this study was to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of quercetin, by inducing haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1), on ethanol-induced microsomal oxidative stress. Chronic alcohol administration to adult rats (4.0 g/kg for 90 days) resulted in microsomal redox disturbance and liver dysfunction, accompanying CYP2E1 upregulation and HO-1 downregulation of both protein expression and enzymatic activity. Quercetin (100 mg/kg) induced HO-1, which was not completely suppressed by ethanol. Moreover, quercetin pretreatment to ethanol-fed rats lowered CYP2E1 induction, partially normalised ethanol-overwhelmed microsomal antioxidative system, decreased ROS level and lipid peroxidation, and alleviated the leakage of transaminases. Given the beneficial effect of HO-1, its induction by quercetin may contribute to the protective role against CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress on hepatic microsomes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84862803557	Curcumin prevents chronic alcohol-induced liver disease involving decreasing ROS generation and enhancing antioxidative capacity	Our previous study found that curcumin, a major active component of turmeric, could ameliorate ethanol-induced hepatocytes oxidative stress in vitro. The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of curcumin on chronic alcoholic liver disease (ALD) in vivo. Ethanol-exposed (2.4 g/kg/day ethanol for the initial 4 weeks and 4 g/kg/day for another 2 weeks) Balb/c mice were simultaneously treated with curcumin for 6 weeks. The results showed that curcumin attenuated ethanol-induced histopathological changes of the liver and ameliorated the evident release of cellular alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Ethanol exposure resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, malondialdehyde (MDA) elevation, glutathione (GSH) depletion and antioxidant defense system impairment, which were significantly reversed by curcumin treatment. In conclusion, curcumin provided protection against chronic ALD and the mechanism might be related to the alleviation of oxidative damage.

84862807211	Quercetin prevents ethanol-induced dyslipidemia and mitochondrial oxidative damage	Lipid metabolism disorder and oxidative stress play an important role on the development and progression of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and mitochondria compartment is presumed as the main source and susceptible target of intracellular ROS. The objective of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoids possessing both antioxidant and hypolipidemic effect, on ethanol-induced dyslipidemia and oxidative damage focused on mitochondria. Chronic alcohol administration for adult male rats (4.0. g/kg for 90. days) resulted in the leakage of alanine and especially aspartate aminotransferases, and morphological malformation mainly evidenced by sustained lipid infiltration and degenerative changes on mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum, which was markedly alleviated by quercetin (100. mg/kg.bw.) pretreatment. Furthermore, quercetin prophylaxis evidently ameliorated ethanol-stimulated mitochondrial dysfunction manifested by decreased membrane potential and induced permeability transition though suppressing glutathione depletion, enzymatic inactivation of manganese superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, ROS over-generation, and lipid peroxidation in mitochondria. Quercetin, thus, may protect rat, especially hepatic mitochondria, from chronic ethanol toxicity through its hypolipidemic effect and antioxidative role, highlighting a promising preventive strategy for ALD by naturally occurring phytochemicals. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84862184984	Plasma heme oxygenase-1 concentration in relation to impaired glucose regulation in a non-diabetic chinese population	Background: Our previous study has recently shown that plasma heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a stress-responsive protein, is elevated in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The current study aimed to examine the association between plasma HO-1 concentration and impaired glucose regulation (IGR) in non-diabetic individuals. Methods: We conducted a case-control study including a total of 865 subjects (262 IGR individuals and 603 healthy controls) in a Chinese population. Basic characteristics were collected by questionnaire and standardized anthropometric measurements. Plasma HO-1 concentration was determined by ELISA. Results: Plasma HO-1 concentration was significantly increased in IGR individuals compared with healthy controls (1.34 (0.81-2.29) ng/ml vs 0.98 (0.56-1.55) ng/ml, P&0.001). After adjustment for age, sex, and BMI, the ORs for IGR in the highest quartile of plasma HO-1 concentrations, compared with the lowest, was 3.42 (95% CI 2.11-5.54; P for trend &0.001). The trend remained significant even after additional adjustment for smoking, alcohol drinking, hypertension, family history of diabetes, lipid profiles and C-reactive protein. In the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, addition of plasma HO-1 concentration to a model with known risk factors yielded significantly improved discriminative value for IGR (area under the curves 0.75 (95% CI 0.71-0.78) vs. 0.72 (95% CI 0.69-0.76); P for difference = 0.026). Conclusions: Elevated plasma HO-1 concentration is significantly associated with increased ORs for IGR. However, its clinical utility should be validated in further studies, especially in prospective cohort studies. © 2012 Bao et al.

84863470671	Effects of flaxseed oil on anti-oxidative system and membrane deformation of human peripheral blood erythrocytes in high glucose level	Background: The erythrocyte membrane lesion is a serious diabetic complication. A number of studies suggested that n-3 fatty acid could reduce lipid peroxidation and elevate α- or γ-tocopherol contents in membrane of erythrocytes. However, evidence regarding the protective effects of flaxseed oil, a natural product rich in n-3 fatty acid, on lipid peroxidation, antioxidative capacity and membrane deformation of erythrocytes exposed to high glucose is limited. Methods: Human peripheral blood erythrocytes were isolated and treated with 50 mM glucose to mimic hyperglycemia in the absence or presence of three different doses of flaxseed oil (50, 100 or 200 μM) in the culture medium for 24 h. The malondialdehyde (MDA) and L-glutathione (GSH) were measured by HPLC and LC/MS respectively. The phospholipids symmetry and membrane fatty acid composition of human erythrocytes were detected by flow cytometry and gas chromatograph (GC). The morphology of human erythrocyte was illuminated by ultra scanning electron microscopy. Results: Flaxseed oil attenuated hyperglycemia-induced increase of MDA and decrease of GSH in human erythrocytes. Human erythrocytes treated with flaxseed oil contained higher C22:5 and C22:6 than those in the 50 mM glucose control group, indicating that flaxseed oil could reduce lipid asymmetric distribution and membrane perturbation. The ultra scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometer have also indicated that flaxseed oil could protect the membrane of human erythrocytes from deformation at high glucose level. Conclusion: The flaxseed oil supplementation may prevent lipid peroxidation and membrane dysfunction of human erythrocytes in hyperglycemia. © 2012 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Methods: The study was cross-sectional with a case-control design, and evaluated 3 groups of subjects: patients with mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease, those with mild cognitive impairment, and normal controls. The World Health Organization Battery of Cognitive Assessment Instruments for elderly people was used to assess the cognitive function of the study patients. Results: Twenty six individuals with Alzheimer's disease, 27 with mild cognitive impairment and 83 controls were recruited. Mean total scores of the Mini-Mental Status Examination were 17.6 (SD, 2.0), 24.2 (SD, 2.1), and 28.7 (SD, 1.1), respectively. The results of the World Health Organization Battery of Cognitive Assessment Instruments tests demonstrated significant differences among the 3 groups for all subtests. Similarly, there were significant differences between the Alzheimer's disease group and either the control group or the mild cognitive impairment group for nearly all subtests. However, significant differences between those with mild cognitive impairment and control subjects were found only for some subtests of the battery; these included auditory verbal learning, delayed recall, sorting, verbal fluency, mini-token, trail making, visual reasoning, and spatial construction. The group with mild cognitive impairment performed significantly worse than controls for these tests. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that auditory verbal learning, delayed recall, sorting, verbal fluency, mini-token, trail making, visual reasoning and spatial construction tests are the more sensitive subtests for early detection of Alzheimer's disease.

84870353001	In vitro characterization and in vivo evaluation of nanostructured lipid curcumin carriers for intragastric administration	Background: Curcumin has a variety of pharmacological effects. However, poor water solubility and low oral bioavailability limit its clinical utility. A delivery system for nanostructured lipid carriers has been reported to be a promising approach to enhancing the oral absorption of curcumin. The aim of the present study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, and relative bioavailability of curcumin in rats after a single intragastric dose of a nanostructured lipid curcumin carrier formulation. Methods: Nanostructured lipid curcumin carriers were prepared using the ethanol dripping method and characterized in terms of the particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, differential scanning calorimetry, drug-loading capacity, encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release. The pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of nanostructured lipid curcumin carriers and curcumin suspension were compared after intragastric administration. Results: Nanostructured lipid curcumin carriers showed a significantly higher peak plasma concentration (564.94 ± 14.98 ng/mL versus 279.43 ± 7.21 ng/mL, P < 0.01), a shorter time taken to reach peak plasma concentration (0.5 ± 0.01 hour versus 1.0 ± 0.12 hour, P < 0.01), and a greater AUC

84872023970	Inflammatory markers and risk of type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis	OBJECTIVE - There has been growing evidence that in flammatory markers play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to systematically review prospective studies on the associations of elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) with increased risk of type 2 diabetes by conducting a meta-analysis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Library databases up until 10 February 2012 was conducted to retrieve prospective studies matched to search terms. We used generalized leastsquares trend estimation to assess dose-response relationships. The summary risk estimates were pooled using either fixed-effects or random-effects models to incorporate between-study variation. RESULTS - The meta-analysis, including 10 prospective studies, with a total of 19,709 participants and 4,480 cases, detected a significant dose-response association of IL-6 levels with type 2 diabetes risk (relative risk [RR] 1.31 [95%CI 1.17-1.46]). For CRP, the meta-analysis involving 22 cohorts, with a total of 40,735 participants and 5,753 cases, showed that elevated CRP levels were significantly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (1.26 [1.16-1.37]), with the absence of publication bias. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses further supported the associations. CONCLUSIONS - This meta-analysis provides further evidence that elevated levels of IL-6 and CRP are signi ficantly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. © 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.

84872146343	Different Physical Activity Subtypes and Risk of Metabolic Syndrome in Middle-Aged and Older Chinese People	Background: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is growing rapidly in China. Tai chi and dancing are common types of exercise among middle-aged and elderly Chinese. It remains unclear whether these activities are associated with a lower risk of MetS. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 15,514 individuals (6,952 men, 8,562 women) aged 50 to 70 years from the Dongfeng-Tongji Cohort in Shiyan, China participated in a cross-sectional study. Physical activity and other lifestyle factors were assessed with semi-structured questionnaires during face-to-face interviews. MetS was defined by the current National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult treatment Panel III criteria for Asian Americans. The prevalence of MetS was 33.2% in the study population. In the multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses, total physical activity levels were monotonically associated with a lower odds of MetS [OR 0.75 comparing extreme quintiles, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.86, P<0.001]. Compared with non-exercisers in a specific exercise type, jogging (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68-1.00, P = 0.046), tai chi (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.88, P<0.001), and dancing (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.47-0.67, P<0.001) were associated with significantly lower odds of MetS. Furthermore, each 1-h/week increment in tai chi and dancing was associated with a 5% (95% CI 2%-9%) and a 9% (95% CI 6%, 12%) lower risk of MetS. Conclusions/Significance: Jogging, tai chi and dancing are associated with a significantly lower risk of having MetS in middle-aged and older Chinese. Future intervention studies should consider the role of jogging, tai chi and dancing in preventing MetS. © 2013 Wu et al.

84874019681	Bilirubin participates in protecting of heme oxygenase-1 induction by quercetin against ethanol hepatotoxicity in cultured rat hepatocytes	To attenuate alcohol liver disease (ALD) is extremely urgent since ALD has been emerged as a major liver disease. The aim of the present study is to investigate the hepatoprotective effect against ethanol-induced injury of bilirubin, a product of heme metabolism degradation via HO and biliverdin reductase catalysis. Ethanol-incubated primary rat hepatocytes (100 mmol/L) were treated by quercetin, bilirubin, inflammatory factors, and/or HO-1 inducer/inhibitor for 24 h, and the cellular damage was assayed. Quercetin lowered ethanol-induced glutathione depletion and superoxide dismutase inactivation, inhibited the overproduction of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species, and decreased the leakage of cellular aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase, accompanying the normalization of bilirubin level. The effect of quercetin was mimicked by exogenous bilirubin in a dose-dependent manner to some extent (within 25 μmol/L) and pharmacological HO-1 inducer hemin, but abolished by HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin-IX. Inflammatory challenge of TNF-α plus IL-6 further aggravated ethanol-induced oxidative damage, which was also attenuated by bilirubin in part. These findings shed a light on the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory role of bilirubin released from quercetin/HO-1 and biliverdin reductase pathway against ethanol hepatotoxicity and highlight a prospective strategy of nutritional intervention for ALD by naturally occurring quercetin to induce HO-1 with the release of bioactive end-products. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84874712687	Intravenous and nebulized magnesium sulfate for treating acute asthma in adults and children: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Objectives: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the effects of intravenous and nebulized magnesium sulfate on treating adults and children with acute asthma. Methods: Electronic literature search and the manual search of key respiratory journals were performed up to October 18, 2011. Randomized controlled trials were included if patients had been treated with intravenous or nebulized magnesium sulfate in combination with β2-agonists and were compared with the use of β2-agonists. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and the relative risks (RRs) were calculated for pulmonary functions and hospital admission respectively. Results: 25 trials (16 intravenous, 9 nebulized) involving 1754 patients were included. In adults intravenous treatment was associated with a significant effect upon respiratory function (SMD, 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.05 to 0.55; p = 0.02) but weak evidence of effect upon hospital admission (RR 0.86,95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; p = 0.06) in adults, and in children with significant effects upon both respiratory function (SMD, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.80 to 3.08; p = 0.0008) and hospital admission (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91; p = 0.008). Nebulized treatment was associated with significant effects upon respiratory function (SMD, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.41; p = 0.009) and hospital admission (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.92; p = 0.02) in adults. Conclusion: The use of intravenous magnesium sulfate, in addition to β2-agonists and systemic steroids, in the treatment of acute asthma appears to produce benefits with respect to improve pulmonary function and reduce the number of hospital admissions for children, and only improve pulmonary function for adults. However, the use of nebulized magnesium sulfate just appears to produce benefits for adults. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84875608037	Quinocetone triggers oxidative stress and induces cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in human peripheral lymphocytes of both genders	Background: Quinocetone has been widely used as an animal growth promoter in China. However, available data showed that QCT has potential genotoxicity. This study was conducted to investigate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of QCT in human lymphocytes. Results: CCK-8 assay demonstrated the severe inhibitory effects by QCT in a dose- and time-dependent manner. DNA damage analysis using alkalic Comet assay revealed a pronounced increase of DNA fragmentation in cells. In contrast, DNA damage was significantly decreased after incubation with S9 mix. This finding demonstrated that the intermediate metabolites of this drug exerted lower genotoxicity than its parent drugs. We further described chromosomal damage induced by this drug employing cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. The micronucleus frequency was significantly increased in quinocetone groups as compared to controls. Similar to the observation in Comet assay, incorporation of S9 mix in the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay could markedly alleviate the chromosomal damage. Moreover, QCT could invoke increase of reactive oxygen species generation in cells. Intriguingly, the toxicity of QCT was more prominent in samples from males than those from females under the same conditions. Conclusion: QCT could induce potential cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in human lymphocytes. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.

84878111805	Quercetin suppressed CYP2E1-dependent ethanol hepatotoxicity via depleting heme pool and releasing CO	Naturally occuring quercetin protects hepatocytes from ethanol-induced oxidative stress, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction and carbon monoxide (CO) metabolite may be implicated in the beneficial effect. However, the precise mechanism by which quercetin counteracts CYP2E1-mediated ethanol hepatotoxicity through HO-1 system is still remained unclear. To explore the potential mechanism, herein, ethanol (4.0 g/kg.bw.) was administrated to rats for 90 days. Our data showed that chronic ethanol over-activated CYP2E1 but suppressed HO-1 with concurrent hepatic oxidative damage, which was partially normalized by quercetin (100 mg/kg.bw.). Quercetin (100 μM) induced HO-1 and depleted heme pool when incubated to human hepatocytes. Ethanol-stimulated (100 mM) CYP2E1 upregulation was suppressed by quercetin but further enhanced by HO-1 inhibition with resultant heme accumulation. CO scavenging blocked the suppression of quercetin only on CYP2E1 activity. CO donor dose-dependently inactivated CYP2E1 of ethanol-incubated microsome, which was mimicked by HO-1 substrate but abolished by CO scavenger. Thus, CYP2E1-mediated ethanol hepatotoxicity was alleviated by quercetin through HO-1 induction. Depleted heme pool and CO releasing limited protein synthesis and inhibited enzymatic activity of CYP2E1, respectively. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

84878903945	Nrf2/ARE is the potential pathway to protect Sprague-Dawley rats against oxidative stress induced by quinocetone	3-methyl-2-quinoxalin benzenevinylketo-1, 4-dioxide (Quinocetone, QCT) is a newly used veterinary drug which has been proven to promote feed efficiency and growth of animals; however, its potential toxicity can't be ignored. Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate the nephrotoxicity of QCT and the oxidative stress induced by it. Sprague-Dawley rats (SD rats) were randomly divided into four groups with doses of 2400, 800, 50 and 0. mg/kg/day with administration of QCT for 4. weeks. Results proved that QCT could induce nephrotoxicity and this phenomenon had dose dependent manner. Simultaneously, this phenomenon was accompanied by intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, enhanced lipid peroxidation and inhibited antioxidant system, i.e. glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GSH). Additionally, the higher expression of Nrf2 in QCT treated groups illustrated that QCT-induced oxidative stress would be partly mitigated by the induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes via increasing Nrf2 expression. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84878940048	Chronic leucine supplementation increases body weight and insulin sensitivity in rats on high-fat diet likely by promoting insulin signaling in insulin-target tissues	Scope: This study investigated the effect of chronic leucine supplementation on insulin sensitivity and the associated mechanisms in rats on high-fat diet (HFD). Methods and results: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either normal chow diet or HFD supplemented with 0, 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5% leucine for 24 weeks. We found that chronic leucine supplementation increased insulin sensitivity together with increased body weight in rats on HFD, but had no effect on insulin sensitivity in rats on normal chow diet. The increased insulin sensitivity by leucine supplementation was not associated with altered ectopic fat accumulation in liver and muscle, plasma levels of lipids and cytokines, but is associated with reduced oxidative stress and improved insulin signaling. Chronic leucine supplementation did not enhance insulin receptor substract-1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation on serine 302, but elevated basal IRS-1 phosphorylation on tyrosine 632 and improved insulin-stimulated protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue of rats on HFD rats, indicating leucine supplementation prevented HFD-induced insulin resistance in insulin-target tissues. Conclusion: Chronic leucine supplementation can increase insulin sensitivity and body weight likely by reducing oxidative stress and improving insulin signaling pathway in rats on HFD. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84879171172	Serum Heat Shock Protein 70 Concentration in Relation to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome in a Non-Obese Chinese Population	Background:Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) represents the most common cause of anovulatory infertility and affects 6-15% of women of reproductive age. However, the underlying etiology is still poorly understood. In this study, we attempted to examine the association between circulating heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) concentrations and PCOS in a non-obese Chinese population.Methods and Results:Human peripheral blood from 52 patients with PCOS and 57 healthy controls, matched for age and BMI, were analyzed. Women with PCOS were found to have significantly higher fasting insulin (FI) levels, as well as Insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) (P < 0.05). Identically, markers of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-Hydroxy-desoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), Nitric oxide (NO)) and inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP)) were markedly increased when compared to controls (P < 0.05). Elevated serum Hsp70 was positively correlated with IR, oxidative stress and inflammation in PCOS, even after adjustment for age, BMI and gynecologic inflammation (GI). The receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis yielded notably different discriminative value for PCOS, with or without an addition of Hsp70 (areas under the curves were 0.884 (95% CI 0.822-0.946) vs. 0.822 (95% CI 0.744-0.900); P for difference = 0.015).Conclusions and Significance:Increased serum Hsp70 levels are associated with the combination of IR, oxidative stress and low-grade chronic inflammation in PCOS individuals, which provides supportive evidence that Hsp70 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. More consequent studies were warranted to confirm the clinical utility of circulating Hsp70, especially in diagnosis and prognosis of PCOS and its long-term health cost. © 2013 Gao et al.

84884721349	Carbon monoxide alleviates ethanol-induced oxidative damage and inflammatory stress through activating p38 MAPK pathway	Stress-inducible protein heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) is well-appreciative to counteract oxidative damage and inflammatory stress involving the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver diseases (ALD). The potential role and signaling pathways of HO-1 metabolite carbon monoxide (CO), however, still remained unclear. To explore the precise mechanisms, ethanol-dosed adult male Balb/c mice (5.0. g/kg.bw.) or ethanol-incubated primary rat hepatocytes (100. mmol/L) were pretreated by tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimmer (CORM-2, 8. mg/kg for mice or 20. μmol/L for hepatocytes), as well as other pharmacological reagents. Our data showed that CO released from HO-1 induction by quercetin prevented ethanol-derived oxidative injury, which was abolished by CO scavenger hemoglobin. The protection was mimicked by CORM-2 with the attenuation of GSH depletion, SOD inactivation, MDA overproduction, and the leakage of AST, ALT or LDH in serum and culture medium induced by ethanol. Moreover, CORM-2 injection or incubation stimulated p38 phosphorylation and suppressed abnormal Tnfa and IL-6, accompanying the alleviation of redox imbalance induced by ethanol and aggravated by inflammatory factors. The protective role of CORM-2 was abolished by SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) but not by PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) or SP600125 (JNK inhibitor). Thus, HO-1 released CO prevented ethanol-elicited hepatic oxidative damage and inflammatory stress through activating p38 MAPK pathway, suggesting a potential therapeutic role of gaseous signal molecule on ALD induced by naturally occurring phytochemicals.© 2013.

84884350052	Association between serum uric acid and the metabolic syndrome among a middle- and old-age Chinese population	Our aim was to study whether there is causal association between serum uric acid and metabolic syndrome (MetS). A cross-sectional study was performed, including a total of 27,009 subjects (23,345 subjects having uric acid data) from the Dongfeng-Tongji Cohort study. The MetS was defined by the International Diabetes Foundation criteria of 2005. Association analysis was performed by logistic regression. A genetic risk score was calculated by adding the uric acid increasing alleles in two SNPs (rs11722228 in SLC2A9 and rs2231142 in ABCG2) which were identified from our genome-wide association study on uric acid levels. The causal association was examined by mendelian randomization analysis. Among a middle- and old-age Chinese population, serum uric acid concentrations were strongly associated with the risk of MetS and its several components (P < 0.0001). The effects were stronger in women than in men. Despite the lack of statistical significance, both SNPs exhibited a trend with increased MetS risk (rs11722228, OR = 1.06, 95 % CI 0.99-1.14; rs2231142, OR = 1.02, 95 % CI 0.95-1.10), consistent with their increasing uric acid effects. Each additional uric acid increasing allele in the genetic risk score was associated with 3 % increased MetS risk (OR = 1.03, 95 % CI 0.98-1.09; P = 0.23). Further adjustment for serum uric acid attenuated the trend of individual SNP and genetic risk score with increased MetS risk (all OR < 1.0). These findings suggested that serum uric acid was associated with MetS risk in a middle- and old-age Chinese population. Whether this association was causal remained to be investigated in the future studies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84891640424	Deoxynivalenol induced oxidative stress and genotoxicity in human peripheral blood lymphocytes	Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most common mycotoxins. The aim of this study consists in using diverse cellular and molecular assays to evaluate cytotoxicity, genotoxicity as well as oxidative damage and to investigate their mechanisms in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The human lymphocytes were cultured in eight different doses of DON (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 250 and 500. ng/mL) during 6, 12 and 24. h. DON was able to decrease cell viability and cause damage to the membrane, the chromosomes or the DNA at all times of culture. It was also able to induce lipid peroxidation and raise the levels of 8-OHdG and ROS in 6, 12 and 24. h. The results of the RT-PCR and the Western Blot indicated that DON is able to enhance mRNA or protein expressions of DNA repair genes and HO-1 in 6. h and to inhibit these expressions in 24. h. DON potentially triggers genotoxicity in human lymphocytes. This mechanism is probably related to depletion of antioxidase and oxidative damage to the DNA that reduced expression of HO-1, thereby inhibiting the ability of DNA repair. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84896480105	Myocardial mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysfunction in intense exercise: Regulatory effects of quercetin	Introduction: Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the intense exercise-induced myocardium injury, and mitochondrial compartment is presumed as the main source and susceptible target of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoids possessing antioxidant effect on repeated intense exercise-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysfunction. Methods: Adult male BALB/C mice were treated by quercetin (100 mg/kg bw) for 4 weeks and subjected to the exercise protocol on a treadmill (28 m/min at 5 slope for 90 min) for seven consecutive days concurrently at the fourth week. Results: Intense exercise in mice resulted in the leakage of creatine kinase-MB (increased from 221.5 ± 33.8 to 151.1 ± 19.1 U/l, P < 0.01) and ultrastructural malformation mainly evidenced by disrupted myofibrils and swollen mitochondria, which was overtly attenuated by quercetin prophylaxis. Quercetin pretreatment evidently alleviated mitochondrial oxidative stress by inhibiting glutathione depletion and aconitase inactivation, ROS over-generation, and lipid peroxidation in cardiac mitochondria of intense exercise mice. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction manifested by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (68.6 ± 7.6 versus 100.0 ± 7.7 %, P < 0.01) and respiratory control ratio (5.03 ± 0.55 versus 7.48 ± 0.71, P < 0.01) induced as a consequence of acute exercise was markedly mitigated by quercetin precondition. Conclusion: Quercetin protects mouse myocardium against intense exercise injury, especially ultrastructural damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, probably through its beneficial antioxidative effect, highlighting a promising strategy for over-training injury by naturally occurring phytochemicals. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84896269207	Quercetin attenuates chronic ethanol hepatotoxicity: Implication of "free" iron uptake and release	Emerging evidence has displayed that oxygen free radicals especially ones promoted by "free" iron play an important role in the development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Naturally-occurring quercetin has been reported to prevent ALD and iron overload-induced damage aside from the "free" iron. The purpose was to explore the potential mechanisms by which quercetin arrests alcohol-induced "free" iron disorder. Chronic alcohol (30% of total calories) or iron (0.2%)-fed adult male C57BL/J mice for 15. weeks resulted in significantly elevated levels of hepatic iron, labile iron pool-Fe and serum non-transferrin bound iron, accompanied with sustained oxidative damage. The hepatotoxicity was further exacerbated by ethanol and iron. Quercetin (100. mg/kg. body weight) alleviated the detrimental effects induced by ethanol and/or iron. The expressions of divalent metal transporter 1, zinc transporter member 14, mucolipin 1, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and ferritin were up-regulated by ethanol and/or iron, which were partially normalized by quercetin. Quercetin prevented ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity, which may be partially attributed to the alleviated disorder of bound iron and "free" iron. The significant suppression of ethanol-stimulated molecules for "free" iron uptake and release may contribute to the hepatoprotective effect of quercetin, although TfR1-mediated physiological pathway of iron uptake also played a role. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to explore the potential association in a Chinese older population. Methods: In a population-based case-control study conducted in a Chinese older population, serum CA-125 levels were measured in 1177 diagnosed CHD patients and 3531 age and sex matched control subjects without CHD.

84898994681	Quercetin protects rat hepatocytes from oxidative damage induced by ethanol and iron by maintaining intercellular liable iron pool	Accumulating evidence has shown that ethanol-induced iron overload plays a crucial role in the development and progression of alcoholic liver disease. We designed the present study to investigate the potential protective effect of quercetin, a naturally occurring iron-chelating antioxidant on alcoholic iron overload and oxidative stress. Ethanol-incubated (100 mmol/L) rat primary hepatocytes were co-treated by quercetin (100 μmol/L) and different dose of ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) for 24 h. When the hepatic enzyme releases in the culture medium, redox status of hepatocytes and the intercellular labile iron pool (LIP) level were assayed. Our data showed that Fe-NTA dose dependently induced cellular leakage of aspartate transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione depletion, superoxide dismutase inactivation, and overproduction of malondialdehyde) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) of intact and especially ethanol-incubated hepatocytes. The oxidative damage resulted from ethanol, Fe-NTA, and especially their combined treatment was substantially alleviated by quercetin, accompanying the corresponding normalization of intercellular LIP level. Iron in excess, thus, may aggravate ethanol hepatotoxicity through Fenton-active LIP, and quercetin attenuated ethanol-induced iron and oxidative stress. To maintain intercellular LIP contributes to the hepatoprotective effect of quercetin besides its direct ROS-quenching activity. © The Author(s) 2014.

84899081311	Interactions between zinc transporter-8 gene (SLC30A8) and plasma zinc concentrations for impaired glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes	Although both SLC30A8 rs13266634 single nucleotide polymorphism and plasma zinc concentrations have been associated with impaired glucose regulation (IGR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), their interactions for IGR and T2D remain unclear. Therefore, to assess zinc-SLC30A8 interactions, we performed a case-control study in 1,796 participants: 218 newly diagnosed IGR patients, 785 newly diagnosed T2D patients, and 793 individuals with normal glucose tolerance. After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, family history of diabetes, and hypertension, the multivariable odds ratio (OR) of T2D associated with a 10 μg/dL higher plasma zinc level was 0.87 (95% CI 0.85-0.90). Meanwhile, the OR of SLC30A8 rs13266634 homozygous genotypes CC compared with TT was 1.53 (1.11-2.09) for T2D. Similar associations were found in IGR and IGR&T2D groups. Each 10 μg/dL increment of plasma zinc was associated with 22% (OR 0.78 [0.72-0.85]) lower odds of T2D in TT genotype carriers, 17% (0.83 [0.80-0.87]) lower odds in CT genotype carriers, and 7% (0.93 [0.90-0.97]) lower odds in CC genotype carriers (P for interaction = 0.01). Our study suggested that the C allele of rs13266634 was associated with higher odds of T2D, and higher plasma zinc was associated with lower odds. The inverse association of plasma zinc concentrations with T2D was modified by SLC30A8 rs13266634. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings and clarify the mechanisms underlying the interaction between plasma zinc and the SLC30A8 gene in relation to T2D. © 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.

84899852890	Quercetin prevents ethanol-induced iron overload by regulating hepcidin through the BMP6/SMAD4 signaling pathway	Emerging evidence has demonstrated that chronic ethanol exposure induces iron overload, enhancing ethanol-mediated liver damage. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of the naturally occurring compound quercetin on ethanol-induced iron overload and liver damage, focusing on the signaling pathway of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were pair-fed with isocaloric-Lieber De Carli diets containing ethanol (accounting for 30% of total calories) and/or carbonyl iron (0.2%) and treated with quecertin (100 mg/kg body weight) for 15 weeks. Mouse primary hepatocytes were incubated with ethanol (100 mM) and quercetin (100 μM) for 24 h. Mice exposed to either ethanol or iron presented significant fatty infiltration and iron deposition in the liver; these symptoms were exacerbated in mice cotreated with ethanol and iron. Quercetin attenuated the abnormity induced by ethanol and/or iron. Ethanol suppressed BMP6 and intranuclear SMAD4 as well as decreased hepcidin expression. These effects were partially alleviated by quercetin supplementation in mice and hepatocytes. Importantly, ethanol caused suppression of SMAD4 binding to the HAMP promoter and of hepcidin messenger RNA expression. These effects were exacerbated by anti-BMP6 antibody and partially alleviated by quercetin or human recombinant BMP6 in cultured hepatocytes. In contrast, co-treatment with iron and ethanol, especially exposure of iron alone, activated BMP6/SMAD4 pathway and up-regulated hepcidin expression, which was also normalized by quercetin in vivo. Quercetin prevented ethanol-induced hepatic iron overload different from what carbonyl iron diet elicited in the mechanism, by regulating hepcidin expression via the BMP6/SMAD4 signaling pathway. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84899922708	Quinocetone-induced Nrf2/HO-1 pathway suppression aggravates hepatocyte damage of Sprague-Dawley rats	Quinocetone (3-methyl-2-quinoxalin benzenevinylketo-1,4-dioxide, QCT) is a widely used veterinary drug in PR China that promotes feed efficiency and growth of various animals. However, its potential toxicity has been concerned recently. In the present study, we investigated QCT-induced hepatocyte changes and its related mechanism, especially the expression of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Oxidative stress induced by QCT in hepatocyte led to DNA damage, inflammation and apoptosis. Nevertheless, hepatocyte has a self-repair system to protect itself from oxidative stress. In the 50. mg/kg/day QCT group, the morphology and function of liver were approximately maintained on normal level, which indicated that the damaged cell might have a self-repair mechanism. Notably, nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 (Nrf2/HO-1) pathway plays a critical role in protecting cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. However, higher doses of QCT (800. mg/kg/day and 2400. mg/kg/day) inhibited the expression of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which resulted in excessive ROS generation and irreversible oxidative DNA damage, inflammation and apoptosis. In conclusion, although QCT-induced oxidative stress activates the expression of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway initially, persistent QCT exposure will inhibit this expression and aggravate hepatocyte damage. Simultaneously, inflammation and apoptosis continues to progress, liver dysfunction and tissue damage will be occurred eventually. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84904751608	Leucine facilitates the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin signaling in skeletal muscle cells: Involving mTORC1 and mTORC2	Leucine, a branched-chain amino acid, has been shown to promote glucose uptake and increase insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, but the exact mechanism remains unestablished. We addressed this issue in cultured skeletal muscle cells in this study. Our results showed that leucine alone did not have an effect on glucose uptake or phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT), but facilitated the insulin-induced glucose uptake and AKT phosphorylation. The insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and AKT phosphorylation were inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, but the inhibition was partially reversed by leucine. The inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), rapamycin, had no effect on the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, but eliminated the facilitating effect of leucine in the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and AKT phosphorylation. In addition, leucine facilitation of the insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation was neutralized by knocking down the core component of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) with specific siRNA. Together, these findings show that leucine can facilitate the insulin-induced insulin signaling and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells through both mTORC1 and mTORC2, implicating the potential importance of this amino acid in glucose homeostasis and providing new mechanistic insights. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.
