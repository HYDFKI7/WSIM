2942555675	Effects of residual second- to fourth-order dispersion in ultra high-speed optical time division multiplexing transmission	We present an expression of maximum fiber-link length, at which the output pulses can return to its original rms time width, in an optical fiber link with up to fourth-order dispersion. The fourth order dispersion is compensated by combination of the effects of proper source chirping and negative residual second-order dispersion. The interesting fact is that the optical pulses can restore itself at a longest distance even in case of chirp parameter being positive, as well as being negative traditionally. The validity of the analytical formulas is also confirmed by split-step Fourier numerical stimulation.

30844455358	Phase jitter control of ultrashort soliton in high-speed communication systems with nonlinear gain	An expression is derived for soliton phase jitter in soliton transmission with higher-order effects in the presence of nonlinear gain and filters. It is demonstrated that soliton phase jitter can be suppressed efficiently by nonlinear gain in addition to filters not only for long duration solitons but also for ultrashort solitons provided that the nonlinear gain coefficients satisfy specific conditions. This scheme offers an alternative means for the development of ultralong distance soliton transmission systems using differential phase-shift keying (DPSK), and exploits a robust technique to achieve a higher-speed soliton communication system using DPSK.

Such new type of solitons can be well supported by an interface between the defect of optical lattice and the uniform media with focusing saturable nonlinearity. The surface defect of optical lattice can profoundly affect the properties of solitons. It is shown that for the positive defect, stable solitons exist at the first bandgap and their powers decrease with defect depth; while for negative defect, stable solitons exist at the second bandgap and their powers increase with defect depth.

It was found that the combination of PT-symmetric linear and nonlinear lattices can stabilize lattice solitons and can provide unique soliton properties. It is revealed that the parameters of the linear lattice periodic potential play a significant role in controlling the extent of the stability domains and that the lattice solitons can stably propagate only in the low-power regime. © 2012 American Physical Society.

We found that the spatial modulation of the nonlinearity significantly affects the stability of solitons in PT-symmetric optical lattices. With the decrease of the strength of nonlinear refractive index modulation, the soliton's stability domain increases, whereas with the increase of the period of nonlinear refractive index modulation, the corresponding soliton's stability range narrows. In addition, we also investigate the influence of variation of the amplitude of the linear PT-symmetric lattice potential on soliton dynamics, in the presence of spatially periodic modulation of nonlinearity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84908099599	Localized modes in dissipative lattice media: An overview	We give an overview of recent theoretical studies of the dynamics of one- and two-dimensional spatial dissipative solitons in models based on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equations with the cubic-quintic combination of loss and gain terms, which include imaginary, real or complex spatially periodic potentials. The imaginary potential represents periodic modulation of the local loss and gain. It is shown that the effective gradient force, induced by the inhomogeneous loss distribution, gives rise to three generic propagation scenarios for one-dimensional dissipative solitons: transverse drift, persistent swing motion, and damped oscillations. When the lattice-average loss/gain value is zero, and the real potential has spatial parity opposite to that of the imaginary component, the respective complex potential is a realization of the parity-time symmetry. Under the action of lattice potentials of the latter type, one-dimensional solitons feature motion regimes in the form of the transverse drift and persistent swing. In the two-dimensional geometry, three types of axisymmetric radial lattices are considered, namely those based solely on the refractive-index modulation, or solely on the linear-loss modulation, or on a combination of both. The rotary motion of solitons in such axisymmetric potentials can be effectively controlled by varying the strength of the initial tangential kick.

They are generated by a superposition of concentric vortices with widely different topological charges. The superposition of two vortices with identical or opposite signs of their charges generates annular chains of quasicircular or oval eddies, respectively, whereas stable multilayered annular solitons are formed by the superposition of more than two vortices. Beams with this structure may form all-optical photonic crystal fibers, and suggest the creation of new matter-wave patterns in Bose-Einstein condensates. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

Such new type of modes exists in the first bandgap for positive defects; while they exist in the second bandgap for negative defects. Particularly, when a Gaussian beam, which is similar to the linear mode, is launched at the defect site, we find that the Gaussian beam can be strongly confined at defect site and robustness along longitudinal direction for a long distance. When launched at a small angle into the defect site, the Gaussian beam exhibits stable snake propagation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These solitons demonstrate additional swinging motion under the action of a kick. Nested crescent solitons, which feature synchronous rotation, are generated by the superposition of several pairs of vortices.

We reveal that the property of these lattices features solitons with some unique properties. It is worth pointing out that the intensity peak position of a soliton moves away from the surface of the lattice as the soliton's power for large propagation constant increases, and at the critical value of propagation constant = 2.1 (corresponding to power P = 6.1), the soliton closest to the surface of the lattice is formed, which reveals that low power is enough to form a real surface dual-frequency lattice soliton. These properties are contrary to those of surface solitons formed with the aid of semi-infinite symmetrical lattices.

It is shown that the annularly phase-modulated SNPs, with a small initial radius of the necklace and modulation parameters, can evolve into stable fundamental or vortex solitons. To the radially phase-modulated SNPs, the modulated "beads" on the necklace rapidly vanish under strong dissipation in transmission, which may have potential application for optical switching in signal processing. A prediction that the SNPs with large initial radii keep necklace-ring shapes upon propagation is demonstrated by use of balance equations for energy and momentum.

In particular, stable solitons exist almost in the whole semi-finite gap for the positive and zero defects. These properties are different from other lattices with defects.

It is shown that the interaction between solitons can be more effectively suppressed by up-sliding filters than that by down-sliding filters in the presence of the third-order filter term. Moreover, the third-order filter term is found to play a positive role in suppressing soliton interactions in the case of non-sliding. © 2009 Chinese Optics Letters.

It is revealed that spatiotemporal soliton clusters carrying zero and nonzero topological charges can stably propagate and the clusters don't substantially rotate despite the value of topological charges due to the effect of friction force in such a model. It is found that if the separation of solitons is larger than a critical value, the cluster is maintained, otherwise solitons exhibit too strong an attraction for each other due to being in-phase, which leads to their instability. Prediction of the minimum separation of solitons for bound clusters is demonstrated by use of energy and momentum balance methods.

It was interestingly found that a positive defect facilitates the generation of surface solitons in the negatively chirped OLs, while a negative defect destroys surface solitons in the positively chirped OLs.

The nonlocal nonlinearity is made anisotropic through elliptic diffusivity. The medium becomes semilocal in the limit case of 1D diffusivity. Families of fundamental and DM solitons are found by means of the variational approximation and in a numerical form. We demonstrate that the collapse of 2D beams is arrested even in the semilocal system.

For a fixed eccentricity of the lattice, soliton families are found in both the repulsive and attractive models. In the former case, the analysis reveals two kinds of gap solitons trapped in the first oval trough (the ring-shaped potential minimum closest to the center): elliptic annular solitons (EASs), and double solitons (DSs), which are formed by two tightly localized density peaks located at diametrically opposite points of the trough, with zero phase difference between them. With the decrease of the norm, the density distribution in the EAS along the azimuthal direction changes from nearly uniform to double-peaked and, eventually, to the DS. In the attractive model, there exist only DSs in the oval trough, while EASs are not found. All such solitons without the angular momentum (l=0) are fully stable. For l 0, vortical solitons-both EASs with a sufficiently large norm (in the repulsive model) and DSs (in models with both signs of the nonlinearity)-are quasistable, exhibiting rocking motion in the elliptic trough (we consider the cases of l=1 and l=2). At smaller values of the norm, the vortical annular solitons (in the repulsive model) are unstable. Stable fundamental solitons trapped in the central potential well are investigated, too, in both the attractive and repulsive models, by means of the variational approximation and numerical methods. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

This is a model of an active optical medium with respective expanding antiwaveguiding structures. If the potentials are strong enough, they give rise to continuous generation of expanding soliton patterns by a 2D soliton initially placed at the center. In the case of the pyramidal potential with M edges, the generated patterns are sets of M jets for M ≤ 5, or expanding polygonal chains of solitons for M ≥ 6.

Using the fact that a spatiotemporal pulse can be easily split by out-of-phase modulation, we impose a periodic modulation on the broad pulse in the transverse plane by means of a phase mask. The modulation slices the pulse into a cluster of spatiotemporal jets, each evolving into a stable STS, if having enough energy. This method allows us to predict the generation of a broad variety of STS arrays structured according to a predefined configuration, including square-shaped, hexagonal, and quasi-crystalline arrays.

Here, we consider two kinds of radially symmetric potentials, namely, a tapered potential (TP) and a raised-cosine potential (RCP). It is found that if the sharpness and depth of the potential are large enough, the soliton can emit either one annular beam or a cluster of ring-like beams, all of which gradually expand upon propagation. By using the TP, one can get a nonstationary annular beam, while a single stationary annular beam can be achieved by using the RCP. The radius of the stationary annular beam is controllable by the modulation period of the potential. Other soliton dynamics, including soliton localization, soliton oscillation, lateral drift, soliton collapse, and soliton decay, are also revealed.

Unique scenarios of the dynamics of dissipative spatial solitons interacting with this potential are put forward, such as generation of straight-lined arrays (or "jets"), emission of either one necklace-shaped soliton array or several such soliton arrays, soliton evolution into an oscillatory mode, and soliton spreading. In addition, by changing the number of lateral planes of the external potential, keeping fixed the other parameters of the potential, the various scenarios of soliton dynamics can transform into each other.

The first kind of solitons can either drift across the lattice, or deflect to the uniform nonlinear medium. The dynamics of such solitons mainly depends on their powers. The other kind of solitons can stably propagate along the surface, and can be controlled by additional Gaussian beams.

79960034969	Splitting broad beams into arrays of dissipative spatial solitons by material and virtual gratings	We elaborate two generic methods for producing two-dimensional (2D) spatial soliton arrays (SSAs) in the framework of the cubic-quintic (CQ) complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) model. The first approach deals with a broad beam launched into the dissipative nonlinear medium which is equipped with an imprinted grating of a sufficiently sharp form. The beam splits into a cluster of jets, each subsequently self-trapping into a stable soliton, if the power is sufficient. We consider two kinds of sharp gratings - 'raised-cosine' (RC) and Kronig-Penney (KP) lattices - and two types of input beams: fundamental and vortical. By selecting appropriate parameters, this method makes it possible to create various types of soliton arrays, such as solid, annular (with single and double rings) and cross-shaped ones. The second method uses a 'virtual lattice', in the form of a periodic transverse phase modulation imprinted into the broad beam which is passed through an appropriate phase mask and then shone into a uniform nonlinear medium. Two different types of masks are considered; in the form of a 'checkerboard' or 'tilings'. In these cases, broad fundamental and vortical beams may also evolve into stable SSAs if the beam power and spacing of the virtual phase lattice are large enough. By means of the latter technique, square-shaped, hexagonal and quasi-crystalline SSAs can be created. © 2010 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

The outcome of the evolution is controlled by the depth and azimuthal anharmonicity of the phase-modulation profile, or by the radius and number of "beads" in the initial necklace ring. Threshold characteristics of the evolution of the patterns are identified and explained. Parameter regions for the formation of the stable polygonal and quasipolygonal soliton clusters, and of stable fundamental solitons, are identified.

It is revealed that in the case when the soliton is launched at the point where the periodic spatial modulation loss profile has its zero value, the gradient force of the inhomogeneous loss easily induces three generic propagation scenarios: (a) soliton transverse drift, (b) persistent swing around the soliton input launching position, and (c) damped oscillations near or even far from the input position. The soliton exhibiting damped oscillations eventually evolves into a stable one, whose output position can be controlled by the amplitude of the inhomogeneous loss profile. Conversely, when the launching point coincides with an extremum (a maximum or a minimum) of the sinusoidal-type loss landscape, both soliton transverse drift and soliton damped oscillations occur due to transverse modulation instability. Moreover, in this case, depending on the balance between the amplitude of the inhomogeneous loss modulation profile and the homogeneous linear loss coefficient, either the launched soliton can maintain its stable propagation at the input position or a stable plump dissipative soliton can be formed while preserving the launching point. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

For uniform real periodic optical lattices and for a positive defect, the fundamental solitons exist in the semi-infinite gaps, and they are stable in wide regions. For a negative defect, solitons can exist in the semi-infinite gap and in the first gap. In the semi-infinite gap, solitons are also stable in a wide region, but are unstable in the region near the Bloch band. In the first gap, solitons are stable. With an increase of the amplitude of the imaginary part of the PT-symmetric nonlinear optical potentials, the stable region in the semi-infinite gap is shrunk; solitons are only stable in the moderate power region.

84872354125	Lattice solitons in optical media described by the complex Ginzburg-Landau model with PT-symmetric periodic potentials	We report the existence, stability, and rich dynamics of dissipative lattice solitons in optical media described by the cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau model with parity-time (PT) symmetric potentials. We focus on studying the generic spatial soliton propagation scenarios by changing (a) the linear loss coefficient in the complex Ginzburg-Landau model, (b) the amplitudes, and (c) the periods of real and imaginary parts of the complex-valued PT-symmetric optical lattice potential. Generically, it is found that if the period of the real part of the PT-symmetric optical lattice potential is close to π, the spatial solitons are tightly bound and they can propagate straightly along the lattice, while if the period of the real part of the PT-symmetric optical lattice potential is larger than π, the launched solitons are loosely bound and they can exhibit either a transverse (lateral) drift or a persistent swing around the input launching point due to gradient force arising from the spatially inhomogeneous loss. These latter features are intimately related to the dissipative nature of the system under consideration because they do not arise in the conservative counterpart of the dynamical model. These generic propagation scenarios can be effectively managed by properly changing the profile of the spatially inhomogeneous loss. © 2013 American Physical Society.

84872308776	Spatial solitons in parity-time-symmetric mixed linear-nonlinear optical lattices: Recent theoretical results	We provide a brief review of recent theoretical studies of optical spatial solitons in parity-time- (PT-) symmetric mixed linear-nonlinear lattices. The existence and stability of optical spatial solitons forming in PT-symmetric lattices with spatially periodic modulation of the Kerr nonlinearity are briefly overviewed. The linear optical lattices are considered to be either regular lattices or superlattices formed by the superposition of two periodic lattice potentials having commensurable lattice periods. The obtained results show that different kinds of linear optical lattices can profoundly affect soliton properties. In particular, by mixing linear and nonlinear optical lattices, a lot of unique spatial soliton properties were put forward. These features may find potential applications in all-optical signal processing and in high-speed circuits for optical communications systems.

84876113981	Defect lattice solitons in two-dimensional Kerr media	We report on the existence and stability of two-dimensional fundamental defect solitons in optical lattices based on both focusing and defocusing Kerr media. It is found that in focusing Kerr media, for positive defect, the solitons only exist in the semi-infinite gap; for negative defect, the solitons may stably exist in the semi-infinite and the first gaps. In contrast, in defocusing Kerr media, for positive defect, the solitons exist in both the first gap and semi-infinite gap; while for negative defect, the solitons only exist in the first gap. Additionally, for zero defect, solitons only exist in the semiinfinite gap for focusing media and only exist in the first gap for defocusing media.

84877629972	Solitary modes in nonlocal media with inhomogeneous self-repulsive nonlinearity	We demonstrate the existence of two species of stable bright solitons, fundamental and dipole, in one-dimensional self-defocusing nonlocal media, with the local value of nonlinearity coefficient having one or several minima and growing at any rate faster than |x| at large values of coordinate x. The model can be derived for a slab optical waveguide with thermal nonlinearity. The most essential difference from the local counterpart of this system is the competition between two different spatial scales, one determining the modulation pattern of the nonlinearity coefficient and the other being the correlation length of the nonlocality. The competition is explicitly exhibited by an analytically obtained asymptotic form of generic solutions. Particular exact solutions are found analytically, and full soliton families are constructed in a numerical form. The multichannel settings, with two or three local minima of the nonlinearity coefficient, are considered here for both local and nonlocal models of the present type. States with multiple solitons launched into different channels are stable if the spacing between them exceeds a certain minimum value. A regime of stable Josephson oscillations of solitons between parallel channels is reported too. © 2013 American Physical Society.

84879474549	Manipulating solitons by antisymmetric inhomogeneous loss in the complex Ginzburg-Landau model	We study the dynamics of dissipative spatial solitons by using antisymmetric-type spatially inhomogeneous loss that locally modulates an optical medium described by the complex Ginzburg-Landau model. We reveal soliton dynamics by launching input solitons at different positions of the spatial modulation loss profile, including its zero value and positive value. The soliton transverse drift exhibits tilt straightaway propagation except for the oscillation in initial stage. The tilt angle of the soliton drift can be controlled by the modulation parameters. We also investigate the dependences of the tilt angle of the soliton drift on the amplitude of the inhomogeneous loss and the linear loss coefficient. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84879892673	Nonlocal multihump solitons in parity-time symmetric periodic potentials	We report on the existence and stability of nonlocal multihump gap solitons in one-dimensional parity-time symmetric periodic potentials. They can exist in the first gap in defocusing nonlocal nonlinearity and in the semi-infinite gap in focusing nonlocal nonlinearity. These solitons can be stable in the defocusing nonlinearity but are unstable in the focusing nonlinearity. For the multihump solitons, the shapes of the nonlinear contribution to refractive index are also multihump. The stability and shapes of the intensity distribution of these solitons will be changed by the degree of nonlocality. We also study the transverse power flow of these solitons. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

84886693188	Accessible solitons in complex Ginzburg-Landau media	We construct dissipative spatial solitons in one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equations with spatially uniform linear gain; fully nonlocal complex nonlinearity, which is proportional to the integral power of the field times the harmonic-oscillator (HO) potential, similar to the model of "accessible solitons;" and a diffusion term. This CGL equation is a truly nonlinear one, unlike its actually linear counterpart for the accessible solitons. It supports dissipative spatial solitons, which are found in a semiexplicit analytical form, and their stability is studied semianalytically, too, by means of the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. The stability requires the presence of both the nonlocal nonlinear loss and diffusion. The results are verified by direct simulations of the nonlocal CGL equation. Unstable solitons spontaneously spread out into fuzzy modes, which remain loosely localized in the effective complex HO potential. In a narrow zone close to the instability boundary, both 1D and 2D solitons may split into robust fragmented structures, which correspond to excited modes of the 1D and 2D HOs in the complex potentials. The 1D solitons, if shifted off the center or kicked, feature persistent swinging motion. © 2013 American Physical Society.

84887100102	Defect solitons in two-dimensional photonic lattices with parity-time symmetry	We report the existence and stability of defect solitons (DSs) in two-dimensional parity-time-symmetric photonic lattices with self-focusing Kerr nonlinearity. We analyze the effect of different values of the local defect strength parameter on stability properties of DSs. In the case of a positive defect, the DSs only exist in the semi-infinite gap and can propagate stably in their entire existence domain. For the uniform optical lattices (zero-defect lattices), the DSs also exist only in the semi-infinite gap, but they are unstable upon propagation only in a tiny domain of their existence region, near the edge of the first Bloch band. In the case of a negative defect, the DSs can exist in both the semi-infinite gap and in the first gap. In the first gap, they are stable only for moderate powers but are unstable for both high- and low-power regimes, near the edges of the first and the second Bloch bands. All DSs in the semi-infinite gap were found to be unstable. Thus the domains of stability can be effectively controlled by tuning the value and sign of the defect strength parameter. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

84890610314	Rotary dissipative spatial solitons in cylindrical lattices	We study both the stability and rotational dynamics of dissipative spatial solitons in optical media described by the cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in the presence of periodic cylindrical lattices. We consider three kinds of cylindrical lattices, which are generated by (a) the refractive index modulation, (b) the linear-loss modulation, and (c) the combined modulation of both refractive index and linear-loss coefficient. The solitons can be trapped inside each concentric lattice ring (circular ''trough'') and can be set into rotary motion by imposing onto the input field distribution a phase slope (or angle), which is proportional to the initial momentum imparted to the soliton in the tangential direction. The rotary motion can be effectively controlled by tuning the amplitude of the modulation profile. For either refractive index or linear-loss modulated cylindrical lattices, the spatial soliton can exhibit stably persistent rotation along the circular lattice orbit only if its initial momentum does not exceed a certain allowable maximum value. But for cylindrical lattices generated by combined refractive index modulation and linear-loss modulation, soliton rotary motion only appears in the initial propagation stage and then stops at certain spatial position. When the initial momentum imparted to the soliton is absent we find that for cylindrical lattices with only linear-loss modulation profile, by varying the modulation depth, the dissipative spatial soliton can display a transverse drift, can spread out into a stable multi-ring-shaped mode, or can decay. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

84891516780	Gap solitons supported by parity-time-symmetric optical lattices with defocusing saturable nonlinearity	We show that the parity-time (PT)-symmetric optical lattices can support stable fundamental, in-phase multipeak gap solitons in defocusing saturable media. These stable solitons exist in the first finite gap and the saturation parameter can affect the existence of the solitons. The out-of-phase multipeak solitons can also exist in the first gap, but they are unstable. We also investigate the transverse energy flow of these solitons in saturable media. The imaginary part of the PT-symmetric periodic potentials will affect the stability of these solitons. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

84892925158	Transformation of optical beams into arrays of dissipative spatial solitons in material and virtual photonic-crystal structures	We propose two generic methods for producing two-dimensional (2D) optical spatial soliton arrays (SSAs) in the framework of dynamical models of material and virtual photonic-crystal media, based on the 2D cubic-quintic (CQ) complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equations. The first method deals with a broad optical beam launched into a dissipative nonlinear medium which is equipped with an imprinted (material) grating of a sufficiently sharp form. The grating splits the beam into a cluster of jets, which subsequently self-trap into stable solitons, if the power of the individual jets is sufficient. We consider two kinds of sharp gratings-raised-cosine" (RC) and Kronig-Penney (KP) lattices-and two types of the input beams, fundamental and vortical. By selecting appropriate parameters, this type of the photonic-crystal structure makes it possible to create various types of SSAs, such as solid, annular (in the from of single and double rings), and cross-shaped ones. The second method uses a "virtual photonic-crystal lattice", in the form of a periodic transverse phase modulation imprinted into the broad beam, which is passed through an appropriate phase mask and then shone into the uniform nonlinear medium. Two different types of the masks are considered, patterned as "checkerboards" or "tilings". Broad fundamental and vortical beams with the periodic transverse modulation imprinted into them may also evolve into stable SSAs, if both the power of the incident beam and spacing of the virtual phase lattice are large enough. By means of the "virtual" technique, square-shaped, hexagonal, and quasi-crystalline stable SSAs can be created. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

84893374836	Defect gap solitons in self-focusing Kerr media with parity-time symmetric linear superlattices and modulated nonlinear lattices	We report the existence and stability of defect solitons (DSs) in a dissipative system with a parity-time (PT) symmetric linear superlattice and modulated periodical nonlinearity based on self-focusing Kerr media. It is found that for positive defects, the DSs can exist stably in the semi-infinite gap. For negative defects, the DSs can exist stably in both the semi-infinite and the first gap. The DSs in high power regions are unstable. If the defect strength increases, the stable regions shrink rapidly and eventually disappear. If the PT-symmetry is broken, all DSs are unstable. © 2014 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

84902283154	Two-dimensional solitons and clusters in dissipative lattices	We study the dynamics of two-dimensional spatial solitons in the structured optical medium modeled by the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with cubic-quintic nonlinearity and a spatially periodic modulation of the local gain-loss coefficient [a dissipative lattice (DL)]. The analysis, following the variation of the DL's amplitude and period, reveals several dynamical scenarios: stable or unstable propagation of a single dissipative soliton (the unstable propagation entails generation of an irregular multisoliton cluster), transformation of the input soliton into stable or unstable regular clusters patterned as the underlying DL, and decay of the input. Most results are obtained by means of systematic simulations, but the boundary of the single-soliton stability domain is explained analytically. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84901992273	Gap solitons in parity - Time complex superlattice with dual periods	A theory is presented to investigate the existence and propagation stability of gap solitons in a parity - time (PT) complex superlattice with dual periods. In this superlattice, the real and imaginary parts are both in the form of superlattices with dual periods. In the self-focusing nonlinearity, PT solitons can exist in the semi-infinite gap. However, only those gap solitons with low powers can propagate stably, whereas the high-power solitons present periodic oscillation and simultaneously suffer energy decay. In the self-defocusing nonlinearity, PT solitons only exist in the first gap and all these solitons are stable. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84906861766	Mixed-gap vector solitons in parity-time-symmetric mixed linear-nonlinear optical lattices	We report on the existence and stability of mixed-gap vector solitons in parity-time (PT)-symmetric mixed linear-nonlinear optical lattices. The first component is single-peaked, and the propagation constant is in the semi-infinite gap. The second component is the out-of-phase dipole mode; its propagation constant belongs to the first finite gap. The imaginary part and the depth of the PT-symmetric nonlinear optical lattice will significantly affect the existence and stability domains of these vector solitons. The propagation constant of the first component can also influence the existence and stability of the vector solitons. Finally, we also study the effect of the PT-symmetric linear optical lattice on the vector solitons' stability. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84906084616	Stability of in-phase quadruple and vortex solitons in the parity-time-symmetric periodic potentials	We report the stability of in-phase quadruple and off-site vortex solitons in the parity-time-symmetric periodic potentials with defocusing Kerr nonlinearity. All solitons can exist in the first gap and can be stable in a certain range. It is shown that the power of vortex solitons decreases and the stable region shrinks with increase of the topological charge. Especially the stable region is very small for double charge vortex solitons. The power evolutions of vortex solitons along the propagation distance are also analysed. Increasing the lattice depth or decreasing the gain-loss component can stabilize vortex solitons. For both lattice depth and gain-loss component there exists a critical value, below or above which all vortex solitons will become unstable. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84908430549	Two-dimensional defect solitons in parity-time-symmetric periodic optical lattices	We report on the existence and stability of two-dimensional (2D) fundamental defect solitons (DSs) in parity-time (PT) symmetric periodic optical lattices based on focusing and defocusing nonlinear media, respectively. The stable regions of DSs in focusing and defocusing nonlinear media are calculated for the point defect. With the introduction of gain and loss component, some unique properties of 2D spatial DSs are displayed in such lattice potential. There exists transverse power-flow in the PT symmetric periodic optical lattice, and the DSs in the high power regions are unstable. Some properties in focusing nonlinear media are very different from those in defocusing nonlinear media. DSs in PT symmetric lattices with line defect based on focusing nonlinearity are studied as well.
