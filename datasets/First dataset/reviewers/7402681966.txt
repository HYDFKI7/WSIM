8644276343	Toughening of cyanate ester resin by carboxyl terminated nitrile rubber	The carboxyl terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile (CTBN) rubber was used to improve the toughness of the cyanate ester (CE) resin. The toughness of the modified blends depended on the CTBN content. The addition of 10 phr (g/100gCE) CTBN in CE resin led to a 200% increase in the impact strength with a loss of storage modulus. The transmission electron microscopy result showed the existence of rubber particles, inferring that phase separation had occured after curing. The thermogravimetric analysis curve of CTBN indicated the presence of cavities which also can be observed on the fractured surface in the scanning electron microscopy pictures using high magnification. Thus, phase-separation and cavities toughening mechanisms function together to improve the toughness. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.

1942507512	Preparation and characterization of chitosan/gelatin membrane for preventing postsurgical adhesions	The chitosan/gelatin blend membrane was prepared by solution casting. Result of scanning electronic microscopy shows that the blend membrane has a homogeneous phase structure. Addition of gelatin can improve the elongation property, the water absorptivity and the degradability of the membrane. The optimum physical-chemical properties are 17.3 MPa in tensile strength, 99% in elongation property, and 123% in water absorbance. Experiments on animals show that the membrane can control the growth of fibroblast, and has good anti-adhesive effect. The addition of gelatin provides a possibility of controlling degradability. The blend membrane can meet the demand of practical application as a postsurgical anti-adhesion membrane.

19944387375	On promoting intercalation and exfoliation of bentonite in high-density polyethylene by grafting acrylic acid	Acrylic acid (AA) grafted high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/bentonite (BT) composites and HDPE/BT composites were prepared via melt compounding. XRD and TEM results indicated that the modification of AA grafting promoted the dispersion and intercalation of BT in HDPE matrix; IR proved that there were interactions between AA and BT sheets. Consequently, with increasing BT content, the tensile strength and Young's modulus of HDPE-g-AA/BT nanocomposites increased, while that of HDPE/BT composites decreased. Moreover, the addition of BT to HDPE-g-AA decreased the ability of crystallization of the matrix. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

27844454913	Microstructure transformation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes during diamine grafting process	1,6-hexamethylene diamine (HMD) was grafted onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) via acid-thionyl chloride route. The characterization of MWNTs was carried out by Fourier transform infrared spectrum, thermal gravimetric analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectrum. The results show that HMD is covalently bonded on the MWNTs after activating by thionyl chloride. During this process, the compact stacking microstructure induced by acid treatment is deaggregated. The apparent specific volume of functionalized MWNTs is even larger than that of the pristine MWNTs. The chemical processing of MWNTs modification was analyzed theoretically in detail and the mechanism of microstructure transformation was speculated. It is proposed that HMD molecules inserted in different carbon nanotubes and break the hydrogen bond structure formed in acidification process. Therefore the dense structure derived from acidification is modified, leading to a less compact stacking and larger apparent specific volume of MWNTs.

33646820323	Polymorphism of nylon-6 in multiwalled carbon nanotubes/nylon-6 composites	The effects of pristine and amino-functionalized multiwalled carbon nano-tubes (MWNTs) on the crystallization behaviors of nylon-6 were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. The results indicate the presence of polymorphism in nylon-6 and its composites, which is dependent on the MWNTs concentration and the cooling rate. More MWNTs and slow cooling from the melt favors the formation of α crystalline form. With the increase in cooling rates, the crystallinity of neat nylon-6 decreases, and that of the composites decreases initially but increases afterward. Moreover, the degree of crystallinity of the composites is higher than neat nylon-6 under high cooling rates, counter to what is observed under low cooling rates. The heterogeneous nucleation induced by MWNTs and the restricted mobility of polymer chains are considered as the main factors. Furthermore, addition of MWNTs increases the crystallization rate of a crystalline form but amino-functionalization of MWNTs weakens this effect. The influence of thermal treatment on the crystalline structure of MWNTs/nylon-6 composites is also discussed. A γ-α phase transition takes place at lower temperature for MWNTs/nylon-6 composites than for nylon-6. The annealing peaks of the composites annealed at 160 °C are higher than that of neat nylon-6, and the highest annealing peak is obtained for amino-functionalized MWNTs/ nylon-6 composites, This phenomenon is closely related to the different nucleation and recrystallization behaviors produced by various MWNTs in confined space. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33646376939	Effect of a novel phosphorous-nitrogen containing intumescent flame retardant on the fire retardancy and the thermal behaviour of poly(butylene terephthalate)	A novel phosphorus-nitrogen containing intumescent flame retardant (P-N IFR) was prepared via the reaction of a caged bicyclic phosphorus (PEPA) compound and 4,4′-diamino diphenyl methane (DDM) in two steps. The product was added to poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) to obtain halogen-free flame retarded polyester. UL-94 test, thermogravimetry and in situ infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize the flammability, thermal degradation properties and the char-forming process. It was shown that the phosphorus-nitrogen containing compound could improve both the flame retardancy and thermal stability more effectively than other P-N flame retardants. Furthermore, it was a good char-forming agent incorporated with the co-addition of polyurethane (PU) when the combustion occurred. The formation of P-N structure was incorporated in the char layer. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33744547610	Preferential melt intercalation of clay in ABS/brominated epoxy resin-antimony oxide (BER-AO) nanocomposites and its synergistic effect on thermal degradation and combustion behavior	ABS/organo montmorillonite (OMT) nanocomposites and ABS/brominated epoxy resin-antimony oxide (BER-AO)/OMT nanocomposites were prepared via melt compounding. The dispersion of OMT in nanocomposites was investigated by wide-angle X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The results revealed an intercalated structure in ABS/OMT nanocomposites and the OMT layers mainly distribute in SAN phase. However, a completely exfoliated structure was found in ABS/BER-AO/OMT nanocomposites and OMT layers preferentially located in the BER phase which indicated that the OMT platelets had a much higher affinity with brominated epoxy resin than ABS resin. Based on the above morphological results, a schematic diagram of the ABS/OMT, ABS/BER-AO/OMT nanocomposites was established. The thermal degradation behavior was characterized by thermogravimetry. The results showed that the exfoliation of OMT can enhance the thermal stability of pure ABS resin and ABS/BER blends. An increase in the limited oxygen index (LOI) value was observed with the addition of OMT and it was found that such an enhancement is closely related to the morphologies of the chars formed after combustion. A synergistic effect between OMT and BER-AO during the combustion of the nanocomposites was found and a schematic mechanism was presented. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33646683346	Effect of multi-walled carbon nanotubes dispersity on the light transmittancy of multi-walled carbon nanotubes/epoxy composites	Two types of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), chemically modified and unmodified, were dispersed in epoxy resin with ultrasonication. The light transmittance characteristics of epoxy composites with different ratios of MWCNTs to epoxy resin were measured at wavelengths ranging from 200 to 1100 nm. Results showed that composites with modified MWCNTs had a much higher light transmittance than those with unmodified MWCNTs. This was presumably due to a more uniform dispersion of modified MWCNTs in the epoxy matrix, as indicated by both transmission electron microscopy and optic microscopy. The wavelength dependency of light transmittance of the composites was expressed empirically as a function of weight fraction (f

33646708069	Structure and properties of multiwalled carbon nanotubes/cyanate ester composites	Two types of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MW-CNTs) with different structure and morphology were used to fabricate cyanate ester (CE) matrix composites. Mechanical, thermal, and transmission electron microscopy tests were performed to evaluate the different effects of the two types of MW-CNTs on the structure and properties of MW-CNT/CE composites. Results showed that the bundled MW-CNTs were easier to be dispersed in CE matrix than single MW-CNTs, and could improve the toughness and stiffness of CE material more significantly. Functionalization of the two types of MW-CNTs, which was achieved by grafting triethylenetetramine groups onto the surface of MW-CNTs, was helpful in improving the dispersion of the MW-CNTs in CE, and thus in fabricating MW-CNT/CE composites with im proved mechanical and thermal properties. © 2006 Society of Plastics Engineers.

33746260061	Preliminary study on phase separation mechanism of PAEK/BMI blends and laminated system with morphology	The phase separation mechanism of PAEK/BMI blend was studied by AFM and phase morphology structure of the PAEK/BMI laminated system was also investigated. The AFM images clearly showed the phase separation mechanism of PAEK/BMI blend, with low content of PAEK, the phase separation progresses according to the Nucleation and Growth mechanism, which leads to the typical phase morphology-sea-island structure. With the content of PAEK increasing, the Spinodal Decomposition mechanism happens and the typical co-continuous phase structure was observed. The content of PAEK further increasing, inverted phase morphology occurred in the blend. The phase separation mechanism observed by AFM was verified by SEM. The impact strength of the blend reached peak value with the 20 phr PAEK, approximately increasing 2 times than the neat BMI matrix. The laminated PAEK/BMI system has the similar phase morphology structure like the blend system. In the region of two matrices, three typical phase structure were observed. This typical phase morphology structure between PAEK and BMI phase was good for improving the toughness of BMI resin and the composite based on the BMI matrix. Sequentially, the above study makes good foundation for using the typical phase morphology structure to improve the toughness of the composites based on BMI matrix by ex-situ concept.

FTIR proved that HDPE-g-YDH151 is chemically bonded to BT sheets. XRD, SEM and TEM results indicated that the introduction of YDH151 promoted the dispersion and intercalation of BT into HDPE. Consequently, HDPE-g-YDH151/BT composites show satisfied mechanical properties, e.g., the composite with 2phr BT has an elongation at break 29% higher and Young's modulus 32% higher than that of HDPE-g-YDH151.Comparatively, BT aggregated in HDPE/BT composites and all the mechanical properties decreased. Because of high interfacial adhesion between HDPE-g-YDH151 matrix and exfoliated BT, which reduces the mobility of crystallizable PE chain segments, and subsequently reduces the crystallization ability. In comparison, the addition of BT to HDPE did not affect the crystallization behavior of the later.

33749539653	Investigation of free volume, interfacial, and toughening behavior for cyanate ester/bentonite nanocomposites by positron annihilation	Effects of filler on microstructure and toughening behavior of cyanate ester (CE)/bentonite (BT) nanocomposites with different content of BT have been studied by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, etc. The interesting results found by PALS indicate that the size and concentration of the free volume holes and the apparent free volume fraction increased with increasing the content of BT, which indicates that adding nano-layers to thermosetting materials can lead to the high crosslinking density structure "looser." The experimental results reveal that the increases in size of free volume holes and apparent free volume fraction are related to the increasing conversion of cure reaction. On the other hand, the mechanism of toughening (by adding the nano-clay to the thermosetting material) has been discussed by combining free volume and interfacial property. It is shown that, for the high crosslinking thermo-setting material-based nanocomposites, both the property of free volume and dispersion state of nano-layers are the two key factors in determining toughening property. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The grafting reaction, phase morphology, clay dispersion, thermal properties, dynamic mechanical properties and flammability properties were investigated. FTIR spectra results indicate that maleic anhydride was successfully grafted onto butadiene chains of the ABS backbone in the molten state using dicumyl peroxide as the initiator and styrene as the comonomer and the relative grafting degree increased with increasing loading of MAH. TEM images show the size of the dispersed rubber domains of ABS-g-MAH increased and the dispersion is more uniform than that of neat ABS resin.

33845476875	Influence of phase dispersant on the cocross-linking of polyvinyl chloride with low density polyethylene	The cocross-linking of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) was studied by THF extraction, FTIR, and Dynamic rheological analysis. It is found that dicumyl peroxide (DCP) could neither induce the cross-linking of PVC itself nor cause PVC chains to cocross-link with LDPE. Butadiene rubber (BR), as a solid phase dispersant (SPD) can not give a hand to the cocross-linking. However, NBR, both as a compatibilizer and SPD, can induce PVC to be crosslinked or cocross-linked with LDPE initiated by DCP. The composite cross-linking agent that consists of DCP, triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC), and magnesium oxide (MgO) is easy to induce PVC to cross-link itself or cocross-link with LDPE.

Three methods, namely, Avrami, Ozawa and Mo, were carried out to analyze the non-isothermal crystallization data. The results showed that the MWNTs in PA6 acted as effective nucleation agents. However the crystallization rate of composites obtained was lower than that of the neat PA6.

When EDPM and DCP are added to the blends simultaneously, the tensile properties could be improved significantly, especially for the blends with LDPE matrix. For example, incorporation of 10/1 (mass ratio) EPDM/DCP improves the tensile strength of the LDPE/PVC (mass ratio 80/20) blend from 7.9 MPa to 8.5 MPa and the elongation at break from 25% to 503%. Results from selective extraction, phase-contrast microscopy and thermal analysis reveal that the improvement in the tensile properties of the blends with LDPE matrix is principally due to the formation of a fine crosslinking network of the LDPE and EPDM phase. The outstanding modification effect of EPDM is explained by its dual functions: molecular entanglement with LDPE and the enhanced efficiency of DCP in the blends. © 2006 World-Scientific.

Thermal stability and flammability properties of ABS/PDSPB composites were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and cone calorimeter test, respectively. The results showed that the addition of PDSPB enhanced the thermal stability and flame retardancy of ABS significantly. The weight of residues improved greatly with the addition of PDSPB. FTIR and SEM investigations revealed that the residual chars contain polyphosphoric or phosphoric acid, which plays an important role in the process of carbonization. The intumescent chars formed from PDSPB and ABS/PDSPB composites were intact, multicellular and strong.

The influence of Oclay on the morphology of composites was investigated. Scanning electron microscopy results revealed the size of the dispersed HDPE, and PEAA phase decreased with increasing Oclay content. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction results revealed that the Oclay was predominately intercalated with some evidence of partial exfoliation. The majority of Oclay platelets were concentrated in the PA6 phase and in the interfacial region between PA6 and HDPE (PEAA). The Oclay platelets played the role of coupling species between the two polymers, increasing the interaction of the two phases in certain extent. These results were proved by FTIR and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. Consequently, apparent emulsifying effect was induced. A schematic mechanism of the apparent compatibilization effect was presented. © 2007 Society of Plastics Engineers.

34547219517	Novel modification of cyanate ester by epoxidized polysiloxane	A novel modification of cyanate ester (CE) resin by epoxidized polysiloxane (E-Si) has been developed, and the modified system is coded as CE/E-Si. E-Si was prepared by the reactions among octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane, (3-aminopropyl)-methyldiethoxysilane, and diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A resin. Six formulations were designed to evaluate the effect of the weight ratio between CE and E-Si on performance parameters. Results reveal that the addition of E-Si in CE resin cannot only significantly decrease the curing temperature of the CE resin but also improve the water resistance and toughness of original CE resin. Moreover, these positive effects increase with the increase of E-Si concentration in CE/E-Si systems. Thermal property investigation shows that the glass-transition temper-ature and initial degradation temperature of CE/E-Si systems are lower than that of original CE resin. For the flexural properties of the CE/E-Si systems, the E-Si concentration in the system exists a threshold, that is, when the E-Si concentration is smaller than the threshold, original CE and CE/E-Si systems have similar flexural properties, whereas when the E-Si concentration is higher than the threshold, CE/E-Si systems have lower flexural properties than original CE resin. All these changes of properties are closely correlated to the structure alteration from neat CE to CE/E-Si networks. ©2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

34547765924	Isothermal crystallization kinetics and melting behavior of multiwalled carbon nanotubes/polyamide-6 composites	Pristine and functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were used to fabricate polyamide 6 (PA6) composites through melt blending. The functionalized MWNTs were obtained by grafting 1,6-hexamethylenediamine (HMD) onto the pristine MWNTs to improve their compatibility with PA6 matrix. The effect of MWNTs on the isothermal crystallization and melting behavior of PA6 was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The Avrami and Lauritzen-Hoffmann equations are used to describe the isothermal crystallization kinetics. The values of the Avrami exponent found for neat PA6, the pristine MWNTs/PA6 and functionalized MWNTs/PA6 composite samples are about 4.0, 1.7, and 2.3, respectively. The activation energies are determined by the Arrhenius method, which is lower for the composites, -320.52 KJ/mol for pristine MWNTs/PA6 and -293.83 KJ/ mol for functionalized MWNTs/PA6, than that for the neat PA6 (-284.71 KJ/mol). The following melting behavior reveals that all the isothermally crystallized samples exhibit triple melting endotherms at lower crystallization temperature and double melting endotherms at higher crystallization temperature. The multiple melting endotherms are mainly caused by the recrystallization of PA6 during heating. The resulting equilibrium melting temperature is lower for the composites than for neat PA6. In addition, polarizing microscopy (PLM) and small angle light scanning (SALS) were used to study the spherulite morphology. The results show that the MWNTs reduce the spherulite radius of PA6. This reduction is more significant for pristine MWNTs. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The toughness of PS/POE blends, reflected by the Charpy impact strength, increased with the content of POE. SEM micrographs showed the poor compatibility between PS and POE. In simple tensile tests, it is very easy to achieve the ratio of crazing deformation, i.e. K by measuring the size changes of samples. The K values decreased with increasing the content of POE, and the deformations of PS/POE blends were dominated by crazing. The plots of the change of volume (ΔV) against longitudinal variation (Δl) showed a linear relationship, and the slope of lines decreased with the content of POE. Measuring samples at the tensile velocities of 5 mm/min, 50 mm/min, and 500 mm/min respectively, the K values kept unchanged for each PS/POE blends. © 2007 World Scientific.

34547332033	Effect of bentonite on the structure and mechanical properties of CE/CTBN system	Cyanate ester (CE) resins are among the most important engineering thermosetting polymers and have received attention because of their outstanding physical properties. However, their main drawback is brittleness. Toughening by rubbers is a notable way to improve the toughness but unfortunately it decreases the modulus and thermostability. The CE/carboxyl terminal butadiene- acrylonitrile (CTBN)/bentonite (BT, a kind of clay) composites were prepared by two-step melt blending of CE, CTBN and amino-modified bentonite. The nanostructure and mechanical properties of the CE/CTBN/BT composites were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Both of the intercalated and exfoliated structures of BT existed in CE/CTBN/BT composites while rubber particles also could be observed in CE/CTBN/BT composites by TEM. When an appropriate amount (about 0.5 wt.%) of BT added into CE/CTBN (100/10 by weight) system, both of the modulus and impact strength increased. A 30% increase of the modulus was obtained without greatly sacrificing the impact strength of the composite when the BT content was 1 wt.%. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

The resultant foams with an appropriate content of the organoclay had a finer cell structure than the pristine PU foams because the organoclay not only acted as a nucleating agent as expected but also acted as a blowing agent of the PU foams; this could be attributed to the bound water between the interlayers of the organoclay. In addition, the incorpora tion of the organoclay up to 4 phr resulted in improvements in the tensile and compressive strengths, with the maximum values appearing at 2 phr (110 and 152%, respectively). The significant improvement in the mechanical properties could be attributed to the finer cell structure and the increased internal strength of the materials due to the higher degree of hydrogen bonding. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

34548102476	The effects of the variations of carbon nanotubes on the micro-tribological behavior of carbon nanotubes/bismaleimide nanocomposite	Two kinds of original multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with different diameters, and one carboxyliated MWCNTs were used to prepare three kinds of MWCNTs/bismaleimide (BMI) nanocomposites. The effects of the diameter, concentration and functional group of MWCNTs used in the composites on the micro-tribological behavior of the MWCNTs/BMI nanocomposites were investigated in this paper. The microhardness, the morphology of the worn surface, the glass transition temperature and dynamic mechanical properties of the MWCNTs/BMI nanocomposites were also measured to figure out the possible main wear mechanism of the composites. Results show that the addition of MWCNTs in BMI resin decreases the friction coefficient of the resin no matter what kind of MWCNTs is added. Moreover, the wear loss rate of all nanocomposites considerably decreases with the increasing of nanotube content until the content reaches 2.5 wt%. Functionalization of MWCNTs changes the main wear mechanism of the MWCNTs/BMI composite from adhesive wear (for pure BMI resin) to abrasive attrition by changing the self-lubricating property of the wore surface, the dispersion of MWCNTs in the BMI matrix, the interfacial strength between MWCNTs and the matrix as well as the internal strength of the materials. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Flammability properties measured by a cone calorimeter revealed that incorporation of clay and MWNTs into ABS resin significantly reduced the peak heat release rate (PHRR) and slowed down the whole combustion process compared to the individually filled system based on clay or MWNTs. The flame retardancy of the ABS/clay/MWNTs nanocomposites was strongly affected by the formation of a network structure. Linear viscoelastic properties of the ABS nanocomposites showed that the coexistence of clay and MWNTs can enhance the network structure which can hinder the movement of polymer chains and improve flame retardancy. From transmission electron microscope analysis, MWNTs were shortened after combustion and there was no significant change in their diameters. For chars of ABS/clay/MWNTs nanocomposites, some MWNTs ran across between clay layers, indicating a strong interaction existed between clay and MWNTs. The existence of clay enhanced the graphitization degree of MWNTs during combustion. Clay can assist the elimination of dislocations and defects and the rearrangement of crystallites. Al

Distribution states of CB and effect of morphology on the electric conductivity of different ternary composites were investigated. Under our experimental condition CB particles located preferentially at the interface between polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polypropylene (PP) in PMMA/PP/CB composites, in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) phase in PP/HDPE/CB composites, and in Nylon6 (PA6) phase in polystyrene (PS)/PA6/CB, PP/PA6/CB, PMMA/PA6/CB, and polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/PA6/CB composites; the ternary composites in which CB particles locate at the interface of two polymer components have the highest electric conductivity when the mass ratio of the two polymers is near to 1 : 1. The ternary composites in which CB particles located preferentially in one polymer have the highest electric conductivity usually when the amount of the polymer component having CB particles is comparatively less than the amount of the polymer component not having CB particles; if the formulations of PS/PA6/CB, PP/PA6/CB, and PMMA/PA6/CB composites equaled and PA6/CB in them is in dispersed phase, PS/PA6/CB composites have the highest electric conductivity and PP/PA6/CB composites have the lowest electric conductivity; suitable amount of PS or PAN in PA6/CB composites increase the electric conductivity due in the formation of a parallel electrocircuit for electrons to transmit. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

36448943946	Curing behavior and kinetic analysis of epoxy resin/multi-walled carbon nanotubes composites	The effect of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), both amino-functionalized (f-MWNTs) and unfunctionalized (p-MWNTs) on the curing behavior of epoxy resin (EP) cured with triethanolamine (TEA), was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Because the triethylenetetramine (TETA) grafted on the f-MWNTs could act as curing agent and the produced tertiary amine as negative ionic catalysts of curing reaction of EP, so the activation energy of the EP/TEA system was decreased by the addition of f-MWNTs. Viscosity played a key role in the curing behavior of the EP/TEA/MWNTs system, for high viscosity of the EP/TEA/MWNTs system could hinder the motion of the functional groups. The curing heat in EP/TEA/f-MWNTs (weight ratio 1/0.1/0.01) system was higher than the neat EP/TEA (weight ratio 1/0.1) system, while the curing heat in EP/TEA/p-MWNTs (weight ratio 1/0.1/0.01) was lower than the neat system. When the content of f-MWNTs was increased to 2 phr (weight ratio of 1/0.1/0.02), the curing heat became lower than that of the neat EP/TEA system, which was the result of the higher viscosity of the EP/f-MWNTs/TEA system. Since the curing heat indicated the curing degree of the system generally, the addition of the f-MWNTs was thought to increase the curing degree of the epoxy matrix at a relatively low content. © 2007 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag.

35948934271	Improving dispersion of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in polyamide 6 composites through amino-functionalization	The focus of this study is to investigate the state of dispersion of different treated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in polyamide 6 (PA6). The MWNTs used in composites were grafted by 1,6-hexamethylenediamine (HMD) via acid-thionyl chloride to improve their compatibility with PA6 matrix. A microstructure transformation of MWNTs is found during the treatment process. Acidification makes the MWNTs compact and grafting HMD promotes the compact structure loose again. The MWNTs after different treatment were used to fabricate MWNTs/PA6 composites through melt blending. The dispersion of different MWNTs in PA6 was observed by a combination of scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the amino-functionalized MWNTs are dispersed more homogeneously in PA6 than the purified MWNTs, and the poorest dispersion is achieved for acid treated MWNTs. It is indicated that the loose structure and functionalized surface of MWNTs benefit the dispersion of MWNTs in PA6. In addition, the amino-functionalization of MWNTs improves the compatibility between the MWNTs and PA6, resulting in stronger interfacial adhesion. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

35948945710	Carboxyl-terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile rubber modified cyanate ester resin	The carboxyl-terminated butadiene-a-acrylonitrile rubber (CTBN) has been proved to be the most effective toughener for cyanate ester (CE) resin. This work mainly focuses on the different modification effects caused by the addition of CTBN with different acrylonitrile content. The phase separation, morphology of fracture surface, and physical properties of the blends are studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic mechanic analysis (DMA), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It is testified that the compatibility and toughness between CE and CTBN had a positive correlation with the acrylonitrile content of CTBN. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

35948967989	Location of a nanoclay at the interface in an immiscible poly(ε-caprolactone)/poly(ethylene oxide) blend and its effect on the compatibility of the components	Nanocomposites based on 80/20 and 20/80 (w/w) poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL)/polyethylene oxide) (PEP) immiscible blends and organophilic layered silicates were prepared with melt extrusion. From transmission electron microscopy analysis, it was observed that the exfoliated silicate platelets were preferentially located at the interface between the two blend phases. When the blend-based nanocomposites were prepared via a two-step process in which the silicates were first premixed with the PEP component or with the PCL component, the silicate layers migrated from the PEP phase or PCL phase to the interface. The rheological behavior of the nanocomposites was also investigated. At low frequencies, the frequency dependence of the storage modulus changed from a liquidlike behavior for the unfilled blend to a solidlike behavior for the nanocomposites, indicating the formation of a network structure as a result of exfoliation. From the scanning electron micrographs, a monotonic decrease of the PEP domain size in the 80/20 PCL/PEP blend was observed as a function of the organophilic clay content. Therefore, a clear emulsifying effect was induced by the organophilic layered silicates in the immiscible PCL/PEP blend. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

37349031070	Effect of silane grafting on the microstructure of high-density polyethylene/organically modified montmorillonite nanocomposites	Organically modified montmorillonite (org-MMT) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) grafted with silane groups (HDPE-g-silane) were melt compounded to give HDPE-g-silane-blend-org-MMT nanocomposites. X-ray diffractometry was performed to investigate the intercalation effect. Transmission electron microscopy was applied to observe the dispersion of org-MMT layers in HDPE matrices. The results indicate that an intercalated structure can be easily obtained in HDPE-g-silane-blend-org-MMT nanocomposites. Furthermore, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy was used to characterize the microstructure of the composites. It is found that the ortho-positron (o-Ps) intensity for HDPE-g-silane is decreased by approximately 10% with a narrower lifetime distribution than that for HDPE. With increasing org-MMT concentration, the o-Ps intensity I

37749032224	A novel glass fiber-supported platinum catalyst for self-healing polymer composites: Structure and reactivity	A platinum-based catalyst supported on glass fiber grafted with 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-1,3,5,7-tetravinyl cyclotetrasiloxane (D4Vi) was prepared and evaluated for the hydrosilylation reaction of styrene and methyldiethoxysilane. The silanization of the glass fiber was conducted with methyldichlorosilane. D4Vi was then anchored on the modified fiber with Si?H bonds through a hydrosilylation reaction mediated by a Pt(0)-D4Vi complex solution catalyst. The very high density of D4Vi grafting conferred a strong hydrophobic character to the modified fiber surface. Fairly good catalytic activity for hydrosilylation between styrene and methyldiethoxysilane was observed on this catalyst. D4Vi molecules were covalently bonded to the glass fiber. The conversion was over 95% after reaction at 25°C for 1 hr.

38149109148	Effect of microencapsulated curing agents on the curing behavior for diglycidyl ether of bisphenol a epoxy resin systems	Microcapsules containing a curing agent, 2-phenyl imidazole (2PZ), for a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) epoxy resin were prepared by a solid-in-oil-inwater emulsion solvent evaporation technique with poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a polymeric wall. The mean particle size of the microcapsules and the concentration of 2PZ were about 10 μm and nearly 10 wt %, respectively. The onset cure temperature and peak temperature of the DGEBA/2PZ-PMMA microcapsule system appeared to increase by nearly 30 and 10°C, respectively, versus those of the DGEBA/2PZ system because of the increased reaction energy of curing. The former could take more than 3 months at room temperature, whereas the latter was cured after only a week. The values of the reaction order (a curing kinetic parameter) for DGEBA/2PZ and DGEBA/2PZ-PMMA microcapsules were quite close, and this showed that the curing reactions of the two samples proceeded conformably. The curing mechanism was investigated, and a two-step initiation mechanism was considered: the first was assigned to adduct formation, whereas the second was due to alkoxide-initiated polymerization. The glass-transition temperature of DGEBA/2PZ was 165.2°C, nearly 20°C higher than the glass-transition temperatures of DGEBA/2PZ-PMMA microcapsules and DGEBA/2PZ/PMMA microspheres, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry measurements. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33644909888	Effect of amino-functionalization of multi-walled carbon nanotubes on the dispersion with epoxy resin matrix	Amino-functionalization of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was carried out by grafting triethylenetetramine (TETA) on the surfaces of MWCNTs through the acid-thionyl chloride way. The amino-functionalized MWCNTs show improved compatibility with epoxy resin and, as a result, more homogenous dispersion in the matrix. The mechanical, optical, and thermal properties of the amino-functionalized MWCNT/epoxy composites were also investigated. It was found that introducing the aminofunctionalized MWCNTs into epoxy resin greatly increased the charpy impact strength, glass transition temperature, and initial decomposing temperature of cured epoxy resin. In addition, introducing unfunctionalized MWCNTs into epoxy resin was found greatly depressing the light trans mission properties, which would affirmatively confine the application of the MWCNTs/epoxy composites in the future, while much higher light transmittance than that of unfunctionalized MWCNTs/epoxy composites was found for amino-functionalized MWCNTs/epoxy composites. SEM of the impact cross section and TEM of ultrathin film of the amino-functionalized MWCNTs/epoxy composites showed that the amino-functionalized MWCNTs were wetted well by epoxy matrix. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40949163821	Effects of triggers on the energy absorption behavior of sine-wave beam and the crush morphology	The composite sine-wave beam is a typically function-integrated structure for energy absorption application. The crushing peak stress and the progressive mean stress associated to the specific energy absorption ratio are critical for the function. Both of them are controlled significantly by the trigger system embedded in the beam. In this study, three trigger systems were designed and manufactured including an end bore weakened, chamfer weakened and gradient weakened beam, respectively. The crush experiments and the macro-and micro structural studies showed that the different triggers greatly affected the peak stress, the mean stress and the crush mechanism. The end chamfer weakened trigger exhibited the relatively best energy absorption behavior characterized by the peak stress, mean stress and the specific energy absorption ratio.

40449132469	Functionalizing carbon nanotubes by grafting on intumescent flame retardant: nanocomposite synthesis, morphology, rheology, and flammability	An intumescent flame retardant, poly(diaminodiphenyl methane spirocyclic pentaerythritol bisphosphonate) (PDSPB) has been covalently grafted onto the surfaces of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to obtain MWNT-PDSPB and according nanocomposites were prepared via melt blending. After high density PDSPB (65 wt%) were attached to the MWNTs, core-shell nanostructures with MWNTs as the hard core and PDSPB as the soft shell were formed. The resultant MWNT-PDSPB was soluble and stable in polar solvents, such as DMF. The optical microscopy and TEM results showed that the functionalized MWNTs can achieve better dispersion in ABS matrix. The linear viscoelastic behavior indicated that MWNT-PDSPB can form network structure at very low nanotube loading than un-functionalized MWNTs. The results of flammability showed that better flame retardancy was obtained for ABS/MWNT-PDSPB nanocomposites due to the better dispersion of MWNT-PDSPB in ABS matrix. The flammability of the composites is strongly dependent on the network structure of nanotubes which reduces the diffusion of volatile combustible fragments generated by polymer degradation which diffuse towards the surface of the burning polymer to evaporate to feed the flame. The grafting of intumescent flame retardant of PDSPB can improve both the dispersion of nanotubes in polymer matrix and flame retardancy of the nanocomposites. © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Differential scanning calorimetry was also used to investigate the phase separation of the blends. The results show that PVC and PS are incompatible and the blends have sea-islands phase structures. Blends prepared via melt mixing have finer phase-dispersion than those prepared via solution casting.

The effects of polymerization time and temperature, as well as aliphatic/aromatic moiety ratio on the physical and thermal properties were investigated. The largest molecular weight of the copolyesters was up to 64100 with molecular weight distribution index of 2.09 when the polycondensation was carried out at 230°C for 6 h. DSC, XRD, DMA and TGA analysis clearly indicated that the degree of crystallinity, glass-transition temperature, melting point, decomposition temperature, tensile strength, elongation and Young's modulus were influenced by the ratio between TPA and OLLA in the final copolyesters. Hydrolytic degradation results demonstrated that the incorporation of biodegradable lactate moieties into the aromatic polyester could efficiently improve hydrolytic degradability of the copolymer even though it still had many aromatic units in the main chains. © 2010 Chinese Chemical Society, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Dispersion of C60 in HDPE/EVA blend was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). TGA and DSC results showed that the presence of C60 could remarkably enhance the thermal stability, and cone calorimeter measurements indicated that incorporating C60 could result in a significant reduction in the peak heat release rate and a much longer time to ignition of the HDPE/EVA blend. Furthermore, the larger the C60 loading level, the better the flame retardancy of HDPE/EVA/C60 nanocomposites. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The result of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements indicated that LaPP particles were homogenously dispersed in PET matrix and no obvious signs of LaPP aggregation were detected. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis showed that incorporating LaPP into PET/GF-MRP enhanced the thermal stability and increased the char residue compared to the sample without LaPP. In the existence of LaPP, the PET/GF-MRP composites could pass the UL 94 V-0 rating test, and the limited oxygen index (LOI) could be enhanced. The structures of char residues observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated that LaPP could promote to form the homogenous and compact char layer. What is more, the presence of LaPP improved the tensile strength and storage moduli of PET/GF-MRP composites. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis directly confirmed that PEI and APP were successfully incorporated onto the surface of ramie fabric sequentially. Assessment of the thermal and flammability properties for the coated ramie fabrics showed that the char residue at temperatures ranging from 400 to 600 C during thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the self-extinguishing ability during vertical flame test were significantly enhanced as compared with the pristine sample, which showed strong dependency on the number of deposited layers, especially on the concentration collocation of both polyelectrolytes. This work provided a simple but effective method for the controlled formation of self-extinguishing intumescent coating on ramie fabric and can be applied to other cellulose systems. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

GNS changed the decomposition pathway of ER at high temperature, enhanced the thermal stability and promoted the formation of char residue. The compactness of both the surface and the bottom char residues were significantly improved with the addition of GNS. Furthermore, GNS can effectively decrease melt flow and inhibit the flammable drips of ER during combustion.

In addition, the effects of backbone structures on curing behaviors of the monomers and thermal and flammability properties of the resulting polymers were systematically studied. The results indicated that BAPNPGCP displayed the highest enthalpy of the curing reaction associated with the ring-opening of benzoxazine, which was due to the effect of benzoxazine ring content per unit mass. Interestingly, the 5 wt% weight loss temperature and char residue after thermogravimetric test for poly(BAPNPGCP) were 8 C and 7% higher than those of poly(BAPBACP). Meanwhile, the total heat release of poly(BAPNPGCP) was less than half of that for poly(BAPBACP), indicating the substantial effect of benzoxazine ring content on flammability and char formation. Furthermore, it was found that poly(BAPNCP) gave the best thermal stability and flame retardancy, which was due to the synergistic effect between naphthalene group and benzoxazine ring content. This study provides new insight into the curing behavior of benzoxazine and further understanding on the high performance of polybenzoxazine. © 2013 Chinese Chemical Society, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

While the ortho-positronium (o-Ps) intensity decreased for HDPE-g-AA and its lifetime distribution is narrower than that for pure HDPE. With the increasing of BT content, the o-Ps intensity increases for HDPE-g-AA/BT composites and the o-Ps intensity decreases for HDPE/BT composites.

Improving the compression after impact	The compression after impact (CAI) properties of bismaleimide (BMI) matrix composites manufactured by resin transfer molding (RTM) were significantly improved by ex-situ RTM technique. The thermoplastic polyetherketone with a functional group of Phenolphthalein (PAEK) was used as toughener. The optical microscopy images of the cross-section of post-impact specimens revealed that the delamination resistance of specimens toughened through ex-situ RTM technique was dramatically improved. The energy absorption mechanism of composites toughened through ex-situ RTM technique was changed from the delamination to fiber fracture, which contributed to the improvement in CAI. The particle microstructure in interlaminar region of composites toughened through ex-situ RTM technique revealed that a reaction-induced phase decomposition and inversion happened in the interlaminar region. The BMI particles were surrounded with the PAEK phase, which can significantly improve the delamination resistance of composites.

ABS/MWNTs composites were prepared via melt blending with the MWNTs content varied from 0.2% to 4.0% by mass. Thermogravimetry results showed that the addition of MWNTs accelerated the degradation of ABS during the whole process under air atmosphere, and both onset and maximum degradation temperature were lower than those of pure ABS. The destabilization effect of MWNTs on the thermal stability of the composites became unobvious under nitrogen, and the addition of MWNTs could improve the maximum degradation temperature. The heat release rate and time of ignition (t(ign)) for the composites reduced greatly with the addition of MWNTs especially when the concentration of nanotubes was higher than 1.0%. The accumulation of carbon nanotubes with a network structure was observed and the char layer became thicker with increasing nanotubes concentration.

Montmorillonite dispersion was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermal stability and flammability properties were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and cone calorimeter tests. Incorporating PDSPB together with montmorillonite enhanced thermal stability and flame retardancy of the ABS resin. The synergistic mechanism is caused by formation of silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) structure formed by reactions between the phosphoric acid generated on heating from PDSPB and montmorillonite. Decomposition of the alkylammonium ion yields strongly acidic catalytic sites that may promote the oxidative dehydrogenation crosslinking charring process and increase the char yield.

55849100758	"cutting effect" of organoclay platelets in compatibilizing immiscible polypropylene/polystyrene blends	In this work, polypropylene (PP)/polystyrene (PS) blends with different organoclay concentrations were prepared via melt compounding. Differing from the results of previous reports, the organoclay platelets are mostly located in the dispersed PS phase instead of the interface. The dimensions of the dispersed PS droplets are greatly reduced and apparent compatibilization effect still exists, which cannot be explained by the traditional compatibilization mechanism. A novel compatibilization mechanism, "cutting" to apparently compatibilize the immiscible PP/PS blends was proposed. The organoclay platelets tend to form a special "knife-like structure" in the PS domain under the shear stress of the continuous PP phase during compounding. The "clay knife" can split the dispersed PS domain apart and lead to the dramatic reduction of the dispersed domain size. © 2008 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

Effects of metal chelates on flame retardancy of polypropylene (PP)/PDBPP systems were studied and the results showed that the presence of metal chelates considerably enhanced the fire retardant performance as evidenced by the increase of LOI values and a great reduction in peak heat release rate of PP/PDBPP system.

54249153203	Flame-retardant-wrapped carbon nanotubes for simultaneously improving the flame retardancy and mechanical properties of polypropylene	Covalently functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) wrapped in intumescent flame retardant were successfully fabricated and characterized. By adjusting the ratio of CNTs and flame retardant, the diameter of the functionalized CNTs was effectively controlled to 20-90 nm. Compared with pristine CNTs, the functionalized CNTs are better dispersed in polypropylene (PP) due to the in situ compatibilization reaction between the active groups of the intumescent flame retardant on the CNT surface and the maleic anhydride groups in the compatibilizer, maleic anhydride-grafted polypropylene (PPMA). Incorporating the functionalized CNTs could confer outstanding flame retardancy on PP/PPMA, and considerably enhance the mechanical properties of the polymeric materials due to the improved interfacial adhesion and stress transfer. Therefore, use of intumescent flame-retardant-wrapped carbon nanotubes and in situ compatibilization are promising strategies for simultaneously improving the flame retardancy and mechanical properties of polymeric materials. © 2008 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

57249084603	Preferential intercalation behavior of clay and its effect on the thermal degradation in immiscible PP/PS blends	The typical immiscible PP/PS blend based clay nanocomposites were prepared via melt blending. The dispersion of clay was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermal stability and dynamic mechanical properties were measured by thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), respectively. Preferential intercalation behavior of clay in PP/PS blends was found. The dispersion of clay is significantly influenced by the polarity of PP and PS, meanwhile the location of clay can be controlled by the alternation of the polarity of PP and PS through chemical modification. The clay migrates from PS phase to PP phase with the improvement of the polarity of PP. However, when the PS is sulfonated, clay migrates back to the dispersed PS phase again. The dispersion and location of clay have profound influence on the thermal and dynamic mechanical behavior of PP/PS blends. The better the dispersion of clay in either continuous phase or disperse phase, the higher the thermal stability of the blends. Besides, samples with clay located in the continuous phase can display the best strengthening effect. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.

56749166071	Influence of polarity on the preferential intercalation behavior of clay in immiscible polypropylene/polystyrene blend	The immiscible polypropylene (PP)/poly-styrene (PS) blend was prepared via melt compounding and the preferential intercalation behavior of clay was investigated by wide angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). It was found that the clay platelets initially located, in the PS phase in PP/PS/Clay composites and PS chains intercalated into the clay layers. However, all clay migrated from the PS phase to the modified PP phase after introducing polar maleic anhydride group (MAH) to PP chains. Interestingly, most of clay migrated from the modified PP phase to the modified PS phase again when PS matrix was modified with sulfonic group, and some enriched in the interphase region. The interaction energy density (B) of the blends was determined by combining the melting point variation with the ternary interaction model for heat of mixing. It was found that the value of B decreased with the Introduction of polar group (MAH or sulfonic group), indicating that the polarization of PP and PS can enhance interaction between clay platelet and polymer component. Different interaction between clay platelet and polymer component leads to the preferential intercalation behavior. The higher polarity of the polymer generates higher interaction between clay and polymer component as well as results in stronger preferential intercalating ability. Moreover, the results of FTIR spectra after extraction of all samples gave additional explanation of the preferential intercalation behavior of clay in the immiscible PP/PS blends. On the basis of the results of the measurement mentioned above, a possible mechanism was proposed. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

65649090963	Effects of melt viscosity on the preferential intercalation behavior of clay in immiscible polypropylene/polystyrene blends	Polypropylene (PP) /polystyrene ( PS) /clay composites were prepared by melt blending at 1600C to investigate the dispersion of clay in the immiscible blend system.The results show that the preferential intercalation phenomenon of clay occur in the immiscible PP/PS blend,as evidenced by wide angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) .Independing on the proportion of PS components and its feeding modes,PS chains intercalate preferentially into clay layers. PP and PS components show different dependence of melt viscosity on temperature, as confirmed by capillary rheological analysis and advanced rheological expansion system ( ARES ) measurements. PS has higher viscous flow activation energy, which means its melt viscosity is more sensitive to the processing temperature. Based on different dependence of melt viscosity on temperature between PP and PS, the effects of melt viscosity on the preferential intercalation behavior of clay were investigated via changing the processing temperatures. The clay platelets gradually transferred from PS phase to PP phase with increasing processing temperature. The results combining TEM and ARES suggest that the preferential intercalation behavior of clay is determined by the difference between the viscosity of the two components. Furthermore, the higher viscosity of component, the stronger shear stress during the compounding process, it consequently results in stronger capabilities of intercalation.

66349092607	The thermal stability and crystallization behaviors of PEN/PBT blends	The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to analysis the miscibility, the crystallization and the thermal properties of different composition of poly (ethylene 2, 6-naphthalate) (PEN)/poly (butylene terephthalate) (PBT) blends. The results show that PEN and PBT is miscible. Adding a little content of PBT, the cold crystallization behavior of PEN is strengthened. And the effects of the content of PBT on the melt crystallization behavior of PEN were ignored. With the increase of the content of PBT, the thermal stability of PEN/PBT blends became worse. Therefore, it is necessary to add proper content of PBT for increase the thermal stability of PEN/PBT blends.

67649482608	Aminofunctionalization effect on the microtribological behavior of carbon nanotube/bismaleimide nanocomposites	Original multiwalled carbon nanotubes (O-MWCNTs) and aminofunctionalized ethylenediaminetreated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-EDA) were mixed with bismaleimide (BMI) resin to prepare O-MWCNT/BMI and MWCNT-EDA/BMI composites, respectively. Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and infrared spectroscopy were used to investigate the influence of aminofunctionalization on the multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) framework. Dynamic mechanical analysis, scanning electron microscopy images of the fractured surface, and field emission scanning electron microscopy of the worn surface were used to determine the possible friction and wear mechanisms of the system. The MWCNT-EDA/BMI composite exhibited a higher friction coefficient value and a lower wear loss rate value than the O-MWCNT/BMI composite, which was attributed to the larger number of defects caused by the aminofunctionalization of the MWCNTs, the stronger interfacial adhesion formed between the MWCNTs-EDA and the BMI resin, and the better dispersive state of the MWCNTs-EDA in the BMI matrix. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

67649607751	Flame retardant mechanism of organo-bentonite in polypropylene	Effects of organo-bentonite on the flame retardancy, mechanical and rheological properties of intumescent flame retardant (IFR) polypropylene (PP) were investigated. The X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements indicated that the organo-clay particles were partially exfoliated. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that incorporating 1.8 mass% organo-clay into PP/IFR considerably enhanced the thermal stability and increased the char residue by ca. 7 mass% relative to the sample without organo-clay. Limiting oxygen index (LOI) tests revealed that incorporation of organo-clay led to a further increase in LOI value of intumescent retarded PP samples. The cone calorimeter measurements demonstrated that the organo-clay cannot only further reduce the first peak heat release rate (PHRR

Thermal stability and flammability properties of polypropylene (PP)/PDBPP composites with various PDBPP loading were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), limited oxygen index (LOI), and cone calorimeter, respectively. The results showed that the incorporation of PDBPP could improve both the thermal stability and flame retardancy of PP considerably. PP/30%PDBPP system had a LOI value of 28 and its peak heat release rate was reduced by 60% relative to pure PP. Infrared spectrum and field emission scanning electron microscope measurements revealed that PDBPP and PP/PDBPP composites would form a continuous multicellular char layer containing phosphoric acid when exposed to elevated temperature. It was suggested that the very char layer was responsible for the enhanced thermal stability and improved flame retardancy. © 2009 Society of Plastics Engineers.

68949173923	The effects of irradiation cross-linking on the thermal degradation and flame-retardant properties of the HDPE/EVA/magnesium hydroxide composites	High-density polyethylene/ethylene vinyl-acetate copolymer/magnesium hydroxide composites were crosslinked via high-energy electron beam irradiation in the presence of triallylisocyanurate. The structure of the cross-linking network was determined with the help of rheological measurements through advanced rheological extended systems (ARES). The thermal and flame-retardant properties of the irradiated composites were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and cone calorimetry. Results showed that the cross-linking network structure could enhance the thermal stability of composites, and did favor to smoke suppression. However, the peak heat release rate (PHRR) increased and the time to PHRR shortened, inferring that the composites after irradiation cross-linking were easier to combust. The char microstructure after cone calorimetry test was observed and used to give explanation of the above results. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

70349780419	Effects of organo-clay and sodium dodecyl sulfonate intercalated layered double hydroxide on thermal and flame behaviour of intumescent flame retarded polypropylene	The thermal and flame performances of intumescent flame retarded polypropylene (PP/IFR) composites with organically modified clay or sodium dodecyl sulfonate intercalated layered double hydroxide (SDS-LDH) were studied. The organo-clay particles were partially exfoliated in the PP matrix, while intercalation and aggregation was obtained for SDS-LDH. Incorporation of SDS-LDH improved the thermal stability and flame retardancy of the intumescent flame retarded PP composite in the early stage of heating and combustion; while the effects of organo-clay came into play in the middle-later stage. Differences in degradation pathway of clay and LDH were responsible for the above phenomenon which bore important implication for the barrier mechanism. The introduction of organo-clay into PP/IFR not only increased the char residue, but also formed compact and folded morphology of char residue which provided more effective protect for underlying materials against heat and oxygen relative to LDH, thus improved the flame retardancy of intumescent flame retarded PP samples more efficiently. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The content of PEG and the crosslinking agent has significant effects on the pore structure, swellability, and mechanical properties of the membranes. The membrane is pH sensitive, exhibiting reversibility and rapid response in swelling to pH changes. The swelling ratio oscillated between ca. 120 and 220 when pH was varied between 3.2 and 11.

73849125923	Effect of clay dispersion on the synergism between clay and intumescent flame retardants in polystyrene	Different formulations were designed to evaluate the effect of organically modified clay (DK4) on the combustion behavior of polystyrene (PS) containing an intumescent flame retardant, poly(4,4-diaminodiphenyl methane spirocyclic pentaerythritol bisphosphonate) (PDSPB). The results of transmission electron microscopy reveal that DK4 selectively dispersed in the PDSPB phase. An investigation of thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the thermal stability of PS resin showed no obvious change with the addition of PDSPB and DK4, but the residue increased. From the results of cone calorimetry, we observed that there were two steps during combustion. The dispersion of DK4 played an important role in improving the thermal stability and the flammability of the PS/PDSPB/DK4 nanocomposites. In the first step, DK4 was restricted in the PDSPB phase; there was no synergistic effect. A synergistic effect occurred in the second step when clay had a homogeneous distribution, in which the peak heat release rates were reduced by about 40 and 61% compared to the pure PS. A model of combustion behavior was developed according to these results. The synergistic mechanism was caused by the formation of the silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) structure formed by reactions between PDSPB and DK4. Field emission scanning electron microscopy characterization showed that such an SAPO structure led to a ceramic-like residue after burning. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

74849089438	Improved microhardness and microtribological properties of bismaleimide nanocomposites obtained by enhancing interfacial interaction through carbon nanotube functionalization	Through the functionalization of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by 0,0(-diallylbisphenol A (DBA), the interface situation between MWCNTs and bismaleimide (BMI) was improved, as detected by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The improved interface situation was considered to be the main reason for the huge increased microhardness value and greatly improved the microtribological property of MWCNTs/BMI composites. Besides, the wear mechanism for the composite was also believed to be related to the interfacial situation. The rough wavelike worn surface of pure BMI resin is attributed to its poor load capacity. The smoother waterfall-shape worn surface of MWCNTs/BMI is related to the interface formed by the addition of MWCNTs while the ultrasmooth worn surface of DBA modified MWCNTs/BMI is due to the greatly improved interfacial interaction of the composite.

The matrix resin, toughening materials and strengthening materials were selected for improving the tensile and impact properties of the flame-retarded PP. Orthogonal experiments were performed to produce an optimum recipe with balanced flame retardancy, impact strength and tensile strength.

76649086075	Effects of reactive compatibilization on the morphological, thermal, mechanical, and rheological properties of intumescent flame-retardant polypropylene	Flame-retardant polypropylene (PP) samples were in situ compatibilized with maleic anhydride grafted PP. Compatibilization reaction was verified by an IR spectrum and gel content measurements. Electron microscopy images showed that compatibilization could considerably reduce the size of the flame-retardant domains, control the phase morphology, and improve the interfacial adhesion between PP and intumescent flame retardant (IFR) with different IFR loading levels. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) of flame-retardant PP increased to different extents after compatibilization, indicating an improvement in the flame retardancy. Compatibilization enhanced the thermal stability to some extent and remarkably delayed thermal oxidative degradation of flame-retardant PP. For PP containing 20 wt % flame retardant, the temperature at which the maximum weight loss rate occurred was enhanced by about 99 °C after compatibilization. The storage modulus and glass transition temperatures were elevated to different extents. Tensile strengths of samples reduced in the presence of flame retardant alone but in the additional presence of compatibilizer were restored to levels similar to those of pure PP. Elongation-at-break values, however, showed IFR concentration-dependent reductions that were less for compatibilized samples. Furthermore, the complex viscosity of a compatibilized PP melt turned slightly smaller, which is favorable to melt processing. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

77951882868	Crystallization and rheological behaviors of amino-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes filled polyamide 6 composites	Multiwalled carbon nanotubes/polyamide 6 (MWNTs/PA6) composites were fabricated by melt blending with both pristine MWNTs (p-MWNTs) and amino-functionalized MWNTs (f-MWNTs). The crystallization and rheological behavior of MWNTs/PA6 composites were investigated. The results showed that all the MWNTs can act as heterogeneous nucleation sites; however, they retard the growth process. It was found that the apparent viscosity of the composites was lower than PA6 at lower p-MWNT content, but was higher than PA6 at higher p-MWNT content. This was attributed to the stiffening effect of MWNTs and the broken physical crosslinks between PA6 chains caused by a large amount of MWNTs. The storage modulus of the f-MWNTs/PA6 composites was first increased and then decreased with the increase of f-MWNT content because of the crystallization and the stiffening effect of f-MWNTs.

The results indicate that MWCNTs were encapsulated by poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA), demonstrating the formation of PGMA-grafted MWCNTs (PGMA-g-MWCNTs), with a grafting ratio of about 22 wt%. The solubility of PGMA-g-MWCNTs in ethanol was dramatically improved compared to pristine MWCNTs, which could contribute to fabricating high-performance polymer/MWCNTs nanocomposites in the future.

The influences of corona discharge parameters such as treatment time and processing power were investigated. The results of energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated the introduction of oxygen-containing functional groups onto the surface of the MWCNTs after heat treatment. The water contact angle tests showed that the hydrophobicity of the MWCNTs was decreased to some extent. The static water contact angle was reduced from 146° to 122° when the time of the corona discharge treatment reached 3 min at the processing power of 200 W. The enhanced thermomechanical and mechanical properties of epoxy nanocomposites filled with the corona discharge treated MWCNTs were observed. The modified MWCNTs conferred better properties on the composites than the pristine MWCNTs because of the improved dispersion of MWCNTs in matrix and the enhanced interfacial interaction between the treated MWCNTs and epoxy. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Morphological observations indicated that LDH lamellae enwrapped the surface of CNTs and the wrapping degree was dependent on the functionalization of CNTs. ζ-potential measurements showed that the interaction between the positive charge of LDH and the negative charge of CNTs was the main driving force of the wrapping process. Both hybrids led to a reduction in the peak heat release rate (PHRR) of polypropylene, indicating that they could confer better flame retardancy on polypropylene with respect to LDH and CNTs. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.

78349262763	Nucleating effect of surface modified MWNTs on crystallization of MWNTs/PA6 composites	The surface characteristic of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) plays an important role in the crystallization of polyamide 6 (PA6). In this paper, 1,6-hexamethylenediamine(HMD) are grafted on MWNTs. The MWNTs before and after modification are used to fabricate PA6 composites through melt-blending. The nucleating effect of MWNTs with different surface characteristic is investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical microscopy (POM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).The heterogeneous nucleating ability of MWNTs determined by the Dobreva method are higher for pristine than amine-functionalized MWNTs/PA6 composites with 1.0 wt% MWNTs. Addition of MWNTs induce more heterogeneous nucleation and retards the crystal growth of PA6. The presence of MWNTs facilitates the formation of α crystalline form, while amino-functionalization weakens this trend. MWNTs act as effective nucleation agents for PA6, resulting in the increased number and decreased size of spherulites. MWNTs facilitate the formation of α crystalline form of PA6. Amino-functionalization decreases the crystallization and nucleating effect of MWNTs on PA6.

Via direct melt polycondensation of terephthalic acid (TPA), 1,4-butanediol (BDO), poly(L-lactic acid) oligomer (OLLA) and PEG, biodegradable aliphatic/aromatic copoly(ester-ether)s, poly(butylene terephthalate-co- lactate-co-ethylene glycol) (PBTLG), were prepared.

By tailoring the molar ratio of diols (BDO and CHDM), we investigated in detail the effects of the CHDM rigid hexacyclic ring on the synthesis, mechanical properties, thermal stabilities, and degradation behaviors of the copolyesters. With increasing CHDM content, the initial decomposition temperature increased from 282.5 to 322.2°C, and the tensile strength improved by nearly four times, from 5.4 to 19 MPa. When the molar ratio of BDO/CHDM was 95/5, the weight-average molecular weight of the copolyester was 89,400 g/mol with a polydispersity of 1.96. In addition, hydrolytic degradation results in phosphate buffer solution indicate that the degradation rate of the copolyesters displayed a strong dependency on the temperature and CHDM composition. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

79953851293	Thermal degradation and flame retardancy properties of ABS/lignin: Effects of lignin content and reactive compatibilization	Effects of alkali lignin incorporation and in situ reactive compatibilization on the thermal stability and flame retardancy of ABS were investigated. Morphology observations show that lignin can form submicron dispersed phases in ABS matrix regardless of compatibilization. Thermal analyses show that lignin will cause a slight thermal instability of ABS due to its relatively lower thermal stability, and compatibilization reaction has little effluence on that. However, lignin can slow the degradation process and increase the char residue of ABS with increasing lignin loading, and the compatibilization does not markedly affect them. Cone calorimeter tests demonstrate that lignin can significantly reduce the heat release rate, and slow the combustion process of ABS, e.g., 20 wt% lignin causing a 32% reduction in peak heat release rate (PHRR). The compatibilization can further reduce the flammability of ABS due to the improved char layer. The char residue analyses indicate that the formation of protective char layer of lignin is primarily responsible for the enhanced flame retardancy. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the addition of nano flame retardants can also improve the mechanical properties of polymer materials compared with the deterioration of traditional flame retardants.

Effects of chlorinated polyethylene (CPE), ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM), styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), and their mixture (CPE/EPDM/SBS, mass ratio: 2/2/2) on the mechanical properties and morphology of the system were investigated. With addition of several elastomers and their mixture, the tensile strength of the blends decreased slightly, although both the elongation at break and the impact strength increased. Among these elastomers, EPDM exhibited the most significant impact modification effect for the tetra-component blends. SBS and the mixture have a good phase-dispersion effect for the tetra-component blend. By adding a crosslinking agent [dicumyl peroxide (DCP)], the mechanical properties of the tetra-component blends also increased. When either SBS or the mixture was added to the blend together with DCP, the probability that the crosslinking agent (DCP) would be at the interface improved because of the phase-dispersion effect of SBS. Therefore, more co-crosslinked products will form between LDPE and other components. Accordingly, remarkable improvement of the interfacial adhesion and hence the mechanical properties of the tetra-component blends occurred. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci.

The flame retardancy of the laminate treated by nitrogen-phosphorous type flame retardant is better than that treated by phosphate type flame retardant. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) of the laminate with nitrogen-phosphorous type treatment increases from 25.2% to 39.1%, and reaches the V0 level in UL94 vertical burning test, while LOI of the laminate with the phosphate type treatment only increases to 27.8%. Cone calorimeter tests show that the laminates with the nitrogen-phosphorous type treatment have increased char residue, extended ignition time and decreased peak heat release rate and average smoke density. It is also found that the mechanical properties of the laminates are not changed because of the little damage on the fiber structure of ramie fabric with the flame retardant treatment.

Among which, organo-clay (OMMT), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been reported and proved to be effective flame retardants for variable polymers. In this paper, a systematical study was executed on flame retarded polypropylene (PP) composites containing intumescent flame retardant (IFR) and the most popular nano-fillers. Dispersion of the nano-fillers was characterized by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the results revealed that all nano-fillers dispersed homogeneously in PP matrix. The effects of nano-fillers on thermal stability and flammable of PP were investigated by thermogravimetry (TG) and cone calorimetry tests, respectively.

SEM investigations of residual char burning after cone calorimeter test revealed that poly(DPA-PDCP) plays an stimulative role in the process of carbonization. The intumescent chars formed from ABS/APP/poly(DPA-PDCP) composites were intact and strong. It is confirmed that the poly(DPA-PDCP) is an efficient char-forming agent for flame retardant ABS resin. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

Here, we report an eco-friendly strategy for fabricating the polymer nanocomposites with well-dispersed graphene sheets in the polymer matrix via first coating graphene using polypropylene (PP) latex and then melt-blending the coated graphene with PP matrix. A ∼75% increase in yield strength and a ∼74% increase in the Young's modulus of PP are achieved by addition of only 0.42 vol% of graphene due to the effective external load transfer. The glass transition temperature of PP is enhanced by ∼2.5 °C by incorporating only 0.041 vol% graphene. The thermal oxidative stability of PP is also remarkably improved with the addition of graphene, for example, compared with neat PP, the initial degradation temperature is enhanced by 26 °C at only 0.42 vol% of graphene loading. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

83355166794	Percolation-dominated superhydrophobicity and conductivity for nanocomposite coatings from the mixtures of a commercial aqueous silica sol and functionalized carbon nanotubes	Superhydrophobic conductive nanocomposite coatings are prepared for the first time from the simple mixture of a commercial aqueous silica sol and functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) by air-spraying at ambient conditions followed by fluorosilane treatment. The relationship between MWNT content and the structure and properties of the nanocomposite coatings is investigated systematically. An ultra-low threshold (<5. vol.%) for superhydrophobicity is observed, which suggests that MWNTs are superior to any other spherical fillers for the construction of superhydrophobic nanocomposite coatings. When the content of nanotubes is below the threshold, the surface roughness mainly caused by the silica nanoparticles is not enough for creating superhydrophobic surfaces. Only above the threshold, the multiscale hierarchical structure is enough for both high water contact angles (>165°) and extremely low sliding angles (<2°). The conductivity is also percolation dominated, while the threshold for conductivity is much higher than that for superhydrophobicity, which can be ascribed to the encapsulated structure and the agglomeration of nanotubes in the composite coatings during air-spraying. Moreover, the aqueous silica sols hold merits of great film-forming capability at relatively low calcination temperatures, and being free of organic solvents. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

84855998290	Relationship between the distribution of organo-montmorillonite and the flammability of flame retardant polypropylene	This article studies the relationship between the distribution of organically modified montmorillonite (OMMT) and the flammability of flame retardant polypropylene which consists of polypropylene (PP), brominated epoxy resin-antimony oxide (BER-AO) and OMMT. Polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride (PP-g-MAH) was used to increase the polarity of PP and aid the dispersion of OMMT. Two model systems, PP/BER-AO/OMMT and PP/PP-g-MAH/BER-AO/OMMT composites, have been prepared by melt blending. TEM studies reveal a significant change in the distribution of OMMT for these two systems. For the first composites, OMMT platelets are aggregated in the BER-AO domains, whereas for the second composites, OMMT platelets are dispersed in the PP matrix. The flame retardant properties of the second composite reflected by UL 94 vertical burning test and cone calorimetry are better than that of the first one. When OMMT platelets aggregate in BER-AO domains as in the first composite, the BER-AO associated with OMMT may agglomerate into long ribbon-like structures during burning, inducing uneven distribution of BER-AO. As a result, loose and uneven residues are formed at the end of combustion. In comparison, OMMT platelets dispersed in polymer matrix are more efficient at stabilizing the polymer and preventing aggregation of BER-AO during burning, which induce thick and uniform char layers at the end of combustion.

84860422177	Effects of carbon nanotubes on the thermal stability and flame retardancy of intumescent flame-retarded polypropylene	Flame retardant mixtures of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and intumescent flame retardant (IFR) were embedded in polypropylene (PP) to investigate what will happen if the additives exhibit two different flame retardation mechanisms. TEM tests showed that CNTs dispersed homogenously in PP matrix without any visible agglomeration. The effects of CNTs on thermal stability and flammability of PP were investigated by thermogravimetry (TG) and cone calorimetry tests, respectively. Results indicated that the introduction of CNTs only enhanced thermal stability of materials in a certain temperature range, but caused a severe deterioration of flame retardancy due to the interaction of the network structure and the intumescent carbonaceous char. Furthermore, conditions for an intumescent flame retardation system to behave with high efficiency were also discussed by a secondary combustion test. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84861983946	Effect of lignin incorporation and reactive compatibilization on the morphological, rheological, and mechanical properties of ABS resin	In order to develop the potential application of industrial alkali lignin, its acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) composites were fabricated via melt blending in the absence/presence of a compatibilizer. The lignin can uniformly disperse in the ABS matrix with number-average dispersed-phase domains of sub-micron scale, ranging from 150-250 nm, as observed by scanning electron microscopy. Infrared spectroscopy reveals that strong intermolecular interactions, mainly hydrogen bonding, were responsible for their good interfacial compatibility. Rheological behaviors show that the presence of lignin restricts to some extent the relaxation of polymer chains without affecting the processing properties of ABS resin. The presence of lignin increases storage modulus and glass transition temperature (T g) of ABS. Incorporating small amounts of lignin, e.g. 5 wt%, can produce ABS composites with enhanced tensile strength and modulus, while higher loading of lignin will reduce mechanical properties. The latter, however, can be improved by reactive compatibilization. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84862916947	Study on curing kinetics and thermal properties of bismaleimide resin containing ether linkage	The cure reaction and thermal properties of bismaleimides containing ether linkage were characterized by methods of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It shows that the cure reaction and thermal properties of BMPN are obviously different from those of BMPB and BMPA because of the existence of naphthalene in the structure of bismaleimide (BMI) resin forming BMPN. The cure reactive activation of -C=C- group in the structure of BMPN is lower than those in the structures of BMPB and BMPA because of stronger electro-attracting ability of naphthalene ring in BMPN, and the activation energy for cure reaction of BMPN (117.7 kJ · mol

84863377812	Irradiation treatment of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and its effect on the thermal properties of their composites with epoxy resin	Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were irradiated to different doses by high-energy electron beams. The structure of the irradiated MWCNTs was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray energy dispersion spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. MWCNT/epoxy composites were prepared by a cast-molding method. The effect of the irradiation on the properties of the composites was studied by scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. Results showed that oxygen-containing groups were covalently bonded on the MWCNTs. The MWCNTs were collapsed and even broken after irradiation. The percentage of the oxygen-containing groups had a maximum of 4% at a radiation dose of 170 kGy. It was found that the irradiated MWCNTs could be easily dispersed in epoxy resin. Addition of 0.5 mass% MWCNTs irradiated with 170 kGy to epoxy resin improved the glass transition temperature and the initial decomposition temperature by 8 and 14°C, respectively.

The glass fibre reinforced composites are made from the novel IPNs bismaleimide-triazine (BT) resin containing BMPN and DNCY. Two Tgs and high storage modulus are shown in DMA curves of these composites. Two glass transitions could be detected between 250°C and 350°C, and the storage modulus show higher than 19,000 MPa. Opposed to composites of co-cure BT resin, the flexural property, dielectric property and moisture uptake value of composites are improved obviously due to the formation of IPNs structure for the composites. This composites show good flexural property, low dielectric constants (DC) and low moisture absorption. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

84864600569	Cross-linking of a novel reactive polymeric intumescent flame retardant to ABS copolymer and its flame retardancy properties	In this work, a reactive polymeric intumescent flame retardant (PDSPB) was synthesized and applied to ABS resin. The flame retarded materials were prepared by direct melt blending of ABS and PDSPB (ABS/PDSPB), as well as melt cross-linking of PDSPB to ABS (ABS-c-PDSPB). The cross-linking reaction was characterized by fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and gel content measurement. The thermal stability, flame retardancy, carbonization chemistry and dynamic mechanical properties were investigated by TGA, dynamic FTIR, SEM, CONE calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The results showed that the addition of PDSPB can effectively reduce the flammability properties including peak heat release rate (PHRR), total heat release (THR) and average mass loss rate (AMLR). An improvement of the limited oxygen index value was also observed. Especially, the cross-linking of PDSPB can improve the ignition time and reduce THR during combustion. Moreover, ABS-c-PDSPB displayed a more obvious intumescent char layer and char weight than that of ABS/PDSPB blends. Furthermore, cross-linking of PDSPB enhanced the thermal stability and considerably delayed the thermal oxidation degradation of ABS. The dynamic mechanical properties were improved and the plasticization effect was reduced by cross-linking of PDSPB. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

First, (bis(2-hydroxyethyl) dipropionate POSS, BH-POSS) is synthesized under mild conditions, then in situ polycondensation is carried out in the presence of terephthalic acid, PLA oligomer, 1,4-butanediol, and BH-POSS.1 H-NMR and Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy confirm that Michael addition reaction of amino-POSS and hydroxyethyl acrylate takes place efficiently and forms BH-POSS in high yield at room temperature. Owing to similar functional groups, BH-POSS could be easily incorporated into the macromolecular chains and obtain final copolyester nanohybrids. Moreover, X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy observations demonstrate that POSS moieties occur self-assembly behaviors and form nanoaggregates with the diameter of 50-100 nm. The thermal stability and mechanical properties of the copolyester nanohybrids containing BH-POSS are substantially improved. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84866098775	Physical wrapping of reduced graphene oxide sheets by polyethylene wax and its modification on the mechanical properties of polyethylene	A facile method to encapsulate the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets physically with polyethylene (PE) wax was developed. The graphene oxide sheets were first wrapped with polyethylene wax, and reduced by hydrazine hydrate. The structure of the wrapped RGO was confirmed by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. The PE wax-wrapped RGO sheets were melt blended with PE to prepare PE/RGO nanocomposites. Transmission electron microscopy and XRD studies showed that this method could provide uniform dispersion of RGO sheets in the PE matrix. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy indicated that there was a strong interfacial interaction between the PE wax-wrapped RGO sheets and PE matrix. Addition of 1 wt % RGO sheets in PE matrix led to a 48% increment in the yield stress and 118% increment in the Young's modulus, respectively. However, the elongation at break decreased with increasing RGO sheets loading content. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

0036960344	Bioabsorbable chitosan/hydroxyapatite composite rod prepared by in-situ precipitation for internal fixation of bone fracture	Chitosan (CS), an N-deacetylation product of chitin, consists of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine units linked through 1 ∼ 4 glycosidic bonds. CS rod is selected as a potential material for bone fracture internal fixation of human being due to its biodegradability and inherent wound healing. Incorporation of hydroxyapatite (HA), the mineral component of bone, could improve the bioactivity and the bone-bonding ability. A HA filled CS rod was prepared by in-situ precipitation. The mechanical properties were characterized and evaluated for suitability as a bone graft substitute. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) was performed to determine the change of the structure of HA in the before and after processing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out to investigate the microstructure of CS/HA composite. Effect of HA content on the mechanical properties and water absorption of CS/HA composite were also investigated. It was observed that the mechanical properties of the composite in the dry condition improved as the percentage of CS content increased. Mechanical properties of such CS/HA composite rod are much better than that prepared via traditional method. Bending strength, bending modulus, double shear strength and compress strength of CS/HA composite are 67.8 MPa, 3.3 GPa, 21.2 MPa and 47.8 MPa, respectively. All of these material properties are twice or three times stronger compared with that of nature bone of human being, indicating that such a novel bioabsorbable CS/HA composite could be used as internal fixation of bone fracture. Furthermore, the water absorption of CS/HA composite decreased when addition of HA powders into CS matrix, which contributes to postponing the attenuation of mechanical properties of CS/HA composite under moisture condition.

0037414389	Phase dispersion-crosslinking synergism in binary blends of poly(vinyl chloride) with low-density polyethylene: Entrapping phenomenon in PVC/LDPE/DCP blend	The co-crosslinked products and the entrapping phenomenon that may exist in a poly(vinyl chloride)/low density polyethylene/dicumyl peroxide (PVC/LDPE/DCP) blend were investigated. The results of selective extraction show that unextracted PVC was due to not being co-crosslinked with LDPE but being entrapped by the networks formed by the LDPE phase. SBR, as a solid-phase dispersant, can promote the perfection of networks of the LDPE phase when it is added to the PVC/LDPE blends together with DCP, which leads to more PVC unextracted and improvement of the mechanical properties of PVC/LDPE blends. Meanwhile, the improvement of the tensile properties is dependent mainly on the properties of the LDPE networks. Finally, the mechanism of phase dispersion-crosslinking synergism is presented.

84866935333	Permeability, viscoelasticity, and flammability performances and their relationship to polymer nanocomposites	Despite abundant studies on gas barrier, viscoelastic, and flammability properties of polymer nanocomposites, comprehensive understandings of these performances and their relationships are still lacking. We herein attempt to gain deep insights into the performances by creating several polymer nanocomposites by incorporating three types of nanoparticles, nanoclay (Clay), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and reduced graphene nanoplates (RGO), into polypropylene (PP). The oxygen permeability, viscoelasticity, and flammability measurements demonstrate that RGO can lead to much more reduction in the gas permeability (by ∼73%) and flammability (peak heat release rate (PHRR) reduction by ∼78%), as well as a higher storage modulus and melt viscosity of polymer matrix relative to clay and CNTs at the same loading (1.0 wt %) due to its higher aspect ratio. Clay performs better than CNTs in terms of gas barrier property due to its lamellar structure while behaves worse than CNTs in terms of increasing the melt viscosity and reducing flammability of polymers. Most important, there is a nearly line correlation among these properties for all polymer nanocomposites despite some deviations. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84870766013	Reactive compatibilization of poly(phenylene oxide)/polyamide 6 blended with poly(phenylene oxide) grafted glycidyl methacrylate copolymer	Poly(phenylene oxide) grafted glycidyl methacrylate copolymer(PPO-g-GMA) was prepared by grafting poly(phenylene oxide)(PPO) with glycidyl methacrylate(GMA) monomer and used as the compatibilizer of PPO/polyamide 6(PA6) (mass ration 60/40) blend. Influence of PPO-g-GMA content on the morphology and properties of the blend was studied. The glycidyl group in PPO-g-GMA could react with the terminal amine or carbonyl group of PA6, thus the interfacial interaction of PPO and PA6 increasing. When PPO-g-GMA was added into PPO/PA6(mass ration 60/40) blend, the phase structure changed from sea-island to co-continuous, and the complex viscosity and storage modulus increased significantly. The difference between the glass transition temperature of PPO and PA6 decreased with the PPO-g-GMA content increasing, which supplied an additional evidence to the compatibilization effect of PPO-g-GMA. When the content of PPO-g-GMA was 5phr, the tensile strength of blend increased to 59.5 MPa and the impact strength increased to 3.7 kJ/m

84872279914	Combination of double-modified clay and polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride for the simultaneously improved thermal and mechanical properties of polypropylene	Double-modified montmorillonite (MMT) was first prepared by covalent modification of MMT with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and then intercalation modification by tributyl tetradecyl phosphonium ions. The obtained double-modified MMT was melt compounded with polypropylene (PP) to obtain nanocomposites. The dispersion of the double-modified MMT in PP was found to be greatly improved by the addition of PP-graft-maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) as a "compatibilizer," whose anhydride groups can react with the amino groups on the surface of the double-modified MMT platelets and thus improve the dispersion of MMT in PP. Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and tensile test were used to characterize the structure of the double-modified MMT, morphology, and the thermal and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites. The results show that PP-g-MA promotes the formation of exfoliated/intercalated morphology and obviously increases the thermal properties, tensile strength, and Young's modulus of the PP/double-modified MMT nanocomposites. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84872828019	Design, synthesis, and application of novel flame retardants derived from biomass	Biomass represents an abundant and relatively low cost carbon resource that can be utilized to produce platform chemicals such as levulinic acid. Novel oligomeric flame retardants, the poly(MDP-PDCP-MA)s (PMPMs), were designed and synthesized using diphenolic acid as one of the raw materials, which is derived from levulinic acid. To change the molar ratio of reactants, a series of PMPM samples with different nitrogen contents were obtained and characterized by FTIR and solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy. The solubility test and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated a good solvent-resistant property and thermal stability. The flame retardancy and thermal behavior of ABS with 30% loading of different PMPM samples were investigated by limiting oxygen index test (LOI), TGA, and microscale combustion colorimeter (MCC). The results showed that PMPMs are effective charring agents that can increase the thermal stability and flame retardancy of ABS. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations of the residue of ABS/PMPM blends indicated the compact charred layer formed was responsible for improving the thermal stability and char yield of ABS with low nitrogen content in PMPM-1 flame retardant.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetry (TG) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the modified montmorillonites. Effects of La-P-OMT on the flame retardancy and thermal stability of microencapsulated red phosphorus (MRP) flame retarded PET were investigated. Poly(ethylene terephthalate)(PET)/MRP incorporated with La-P-OMT show better thermal stability and higher char residues than that without La. PET composites containing 4% La-P-OMT and 4% MRP can achieve the V0 level in UL 94 test. The morphological structures observed by SEM demonstrate that modified montmorillonite can promote the formation of homogenous and compact char layer.

84874247133	Synergistic effects of expandable graphite and ammonium polyphosphate with a new carbon source derived from biomass in flame retardant ABS	A novel flame retardant system, ammonium polyphosphate (APP), and expandable graphite (EG) with a new carbon source, poly(diphenolic phenyl phosphate) (poly(DPA-PDCP)), derived from biomass has been proven to be effective in preventing melting drip and improving flame retardancy of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS) in this study, which was manifested by limiting oxygen index (LOI) and vertical flammability (UL-94) tests. The optimal synergy was exhibited at a loading of 30 wt % of three flame retardants in a proper ratio (APP/poly(DPA-PDCP)/EG = 12/3/15). Thermogravimetric analysis result indicated the char residue and the thermal stability could be enhanced because of the synergistic effect of APP/poly(DPA-PDCP)/EG, which is elaborated by a hypothesis of flame retardancy mechanism of the three components. The morphologies of cross-section and char residue by SEM were also described. The dynamic mechanical analysis implied that APP/poly(DPA-PDCP)/EG together can enhance the dynamic mechanical property of ABS. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Effects of a-MMT and b-MMT on the flammability property and thermal stability of the blends were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry (TG), microscale combustion calorimeter (MCC), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and so on. The results show that 1,3-benzenenediol polymer with phosphoric trichloride phenyl ester (BDP) modified montmorillonite (BDP-MMT) decreased the initial decomposition temperature of the flame retardant PC/ABS blends, while a-MMT and b-MMT increased it. The addition of BDP-MMT deteriorated the barrier property of carbon layer. But a-MMT and b-MMT enhanced the thermal stability of carbon layer and delayed the time of second peak of heat release rate (PHRR2). Moreover, PC/ABS blends flame resisted by montmrillonite treated with proper acid concentration were classified as UL-94 V-0.

84879419562	Modification of ramie fabric with a metal-ion-doped flame-retardant coating	Transition-metal-ion-doped flame-retardant coatings were constructed on the surface of ramie fabrics by a layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly technique to investigate possible cooperative actions that could improve the fabric's flame-retardant efficiency. We found that these functional coatings, consisting of poly(vinylphosphonic acid) (the anionic layer) and branched polyethylenimine/cupric or zinc ions (the cationic layer), improved the fire retardancy of the ramie fabrics remarkably. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy demonstrated the successful LbL assembly process and the incorporation of metal ions into the coating. Thermogravimetric analysis coupled with FTIR spectrometry, vertical flame testing, and microscale combustion calorimetry confirmed the improved thermal stability and reduced flammability of the coated ramie fabrics. All of the results show that the metal-ion-doped flame-retardant coatings not only dramatically increased the residues but also retained the original weave structure and fiber morphology of ramie fabrics well. The enhanced flame-retardant efficiency may have been caused by the lower decomposition temperature of the flame-retardant coating, as promoted by cupric and zinc ions, and as a result, may have helped the flame-retardant activity to take place earlier.

Incorporating OMT into GF-PET/MRP, the nanocomposites showed higher char residues than GF-PET/MRP materials. Compared to GF-PET/MRP, the addition of OMT can not only delay the time to ignition (TTI), but further reduce the peak heat release rate (PHRR) of samples. The char residue of GF-PET/MRP displayed a plain land-like structure, while the residue of GF-PET/MRP/OMT displayed a folded structure morphology because of the deposition of carbonaceous residues on the surface of montmorillonite layers. This folded morphology of residue was responsible for the enhanced thermal stability and improved flame retardancy.

84883770252	Confinement of C	Anelastic spectroscopy and rheometrics were used to study the viscoelastic properties of polystyrene/C60 nanocomposites. 0.1 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 1 wt% and 2 wt% C60 were added to pure polystyrene via melt compounding. Both storage modulus and viscosity decreased obviously when 0.1 wt% C60 was added and it was ascribed to the increase of free volume around C60 nanoparticles. Both glass transition and liquid-liquid transition moved to high temperature, which was associated with the confinement effect of the nanoparticles. The addition of C60 influenced chain packing of polymer melts. The increase of free volume loosened the interaction between chain segments and nanoparticles on small size scale. So, the change of segment dynamics was not very obvious. On the contrary, the change of whole chain dynamics was very obvious. This can be explained by the fact that the influence coming from the increase of free volume was neglectable and the filler confinement of nanoparticles played an important role. The C60 nanoparticles were looked as attractors of the polymer chains, which divided the long chains into several segments leading to decrease the fragility of the nanocomposites. © 2013 SPIE.

0346038943	The effect of morphology on the optical properties of transparent epoxy/montmorillonite composites	Three kinds of epoxy-based transparent nanocomposites were prepared by the reaction of alkylammonium-exchanged montmorillonite (AMT) with diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and triethylamine as the curing agent. The morphology of these composites was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The effect of morphology on the optical transparency of epoxy/AMT composites (Ep/AMT) was investigated. The light transmittance of Ep/AMT depended greatly on the exfoliation degree (ED) of AMT in the epoxy matrix, and the transmittance of the composites with higher ED was notably higher than that with lower ED under the same AMT content. The light transmittance of composites prepared with different amounts of curing agent was also studied. Results suggested that the composites prepared with insufficient curing agent were more transparent than those prepared with stoichiometric and higher contents of curing agent because insufficient curing agent was benefitial to the exfoliation of AMT. An equation describes the relationship of the light transmittance of nanocomposites with the concentration, particle size and basal spacing of AMT as well as the wavelength. Theoretical analysis suggested that the effect of morphology on the transparence mainly comes from the changes of the particle size and basal spacing of AMT, and that the effect of the former is more significant than that of the latter © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.

84893481695	Carbon nanotube bridged cerium phenylphosphonate hybrids, fabrication and their effects on the thermal stability and flame retardancy of the HDPE/BFR composite	Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) bridged cerium phenylphosphonate (CeHPP) hybrids (Ce-MWNTs) were facilely prepared through the in situ introduction of MWNTs into the hydrothermal reaction system of CeHPP, aiming at enhancing the flame retardancy of the polymer. Morphological observations indicated that the MWNTs acted as bridges to connect CeHPP lamellas to form a consecutive structure. Moreover, due to the good dispersion of CeHPP and the acting force between CeHPP and the MWNTs, the hybrids were dispersed uniformly resisting the strong intermolecular attractions. The hybrids led to a reduction in the peak heat release rate (PHRR) of the conventional flame retardant high-density polyethylene (HDPE) composite and improved the UL-94 grade from V-2 to V-0, indicating that they could confer a better flame retardancy on HDPE compared to the CeHPP or MWNTs alone. The results of the pyrolysis products and the morphology of the chars gave the evidence that Ce-MWNTs could enhance the physical barrier effect to retard the vaporization of flammable gases and the transfer of heat because of the mutual complementarity of the CeHPP and MWNTs. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that CeHPP was a one-dimensional nanocrystal with the interlamellar distance of 1.57 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that CeHPP had the excellent thermal stability and abundant char residue. Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) revealed that CeHPP dispersed homogenously in both PET and DBDPO phases. CeHPP could form a continuous and compact char layer in PET nanocomposites and had a synergistic effect with DBDPO. The collaboration of 2 wt% CeHPP and 6 wt% DBDPO dramatically improved UL 94 rating (from V-2 to V-0) and limiting oxygen index (LOI) value (from 22.9% to 29.1%) for PET.

84896761316	The study of fibre/matrix bond strength in short hemp polypropylene composites from dynamic mechanical analysis	This paper presents results from an experimental study on the static and dynamic mechanical and viscoelastic properties of short hemp fibre polypropylene composites. Composites containing 10-60 wt.% short noil hemp fibre were injection moulded. The maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) and maleic anhydride grafted Poly(ethylene octane) (MAPOE) were used as coupling agents for modifying the matrices. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) of the composites were performed over a temperature range of 25-150 C under frequency of 1 Hz. DMTA revealed no noticeable changes in α-transition temperature when the fibre content was increased or coupling agents were added. The composites revealed better temperature resistance at higher fibre content. However, the increase in storage modulus was negligible in composites reinforced with more than 40 wt.% hemp fibres; due to the agglomeration of the fibres. The results of the damping ratio analysis revealed that higher interfacial bonding was achieved by addition of MAPP coupling agent in comparison with addition of MAPOE coupling agent. This was also confirmed by tensile strength experiments and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84898960962	Flame-retardant coating by alternate assembly of poly(vinylphosphonic acid) and polyethylenimine for ramie fabrics	A novel intumescent flame retardant coating, consisting of poly(vinylphosphonic acid) (PVPA) as the acid source and branched polyethylenimine (BPEI) as the blowing agent, was constructed on the surface of ramie fabrics by alternate assembly to remarkably improve the flame retardancy of ramie. The PVPA/BPEI coating on the surface of individual fibers of ramie fabric pyrolyzes to form protective char layer upon heating/burning and improves the flame retardancy of ramie. Thermogravimetric analysis reveals that the PVPA/BPEI-coated ramie fabrics left as much as 25.8 wt% residue at 600 °C, while the control (uncoated) fabric left less than 1.4 wt% residue. Vertical flame test shows that all PVPA/BPEI-coated fabrics have shorter after-flame time, and the residues well preserved the original weave structure and fiber morphology, whereas, the uncoated fabric left only ashes. Microscale combustion calorimetry shows that the PVPA/BPEI coatings greatly reduce the total heat release by as much as 66% and the heat release capacity by 76%, relative to those of the uncoated fabric. © Chinese Chemical Society.

84899582121	Effect of graphene nanosheets and layered double hydroxides on the flame retardancy and thermal degradation of epoxy resin	The effects of graphene nanosheets (GNS) and layered double hydroxides (LDH) on morphology, flame retardancy and thermal degradation of epoxy resin (ER) were investigated. LDH was exfoliated in ER/GNS/LDH nanocomposites, while GNS was partially exfoliated and partially agglomerated into small clusters. Since not all of the GNS had good dispersion, the compactness and barrier properties of residual char in ER/GNS/LDH were inferior to ER/GNS and ER/LDH. However, the simultaneous addition of GNS and LDH created an additional GNS-LDH interface, which could increase interaction in the melt and inhibit the flammable drips of ER and thus limit the flame propagation during combustion. As a result, a synergistic effect of simultaneous addition of GNS and LDH to improve the flame retardancy of ER was realized. The LOI value of ER was increased from 15.9 to 23.6 by adding 0.5 wt% of GNS and 0.5 wt% of LDH. In comparison, the LOI value was 19.5 and 21.7 when GNS or LDH was added separately, at the same level, 1 wt%. Furthermore, both GNS and LDH can increase the thermal stability of ER; there was a synergistic effect between them to decrease the THR of ER from 33.4 to 24.6. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

84900870954	Compatibilization of polyamide 6/poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide)blends by poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride)	The properties of polyamide 6 (PA6)/poly(2,6- dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO) blends (60/40, wt%) compatibilized by poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (SMA) were studied. The addition of SMA can form an in situ copolymer, SMA-graft-PA6. The SMA-graft-PA6 copolymer actually plays a key role as a compatibilizer toimprove the interface between PA6 and PPO. It was found that the effect of compatibilization resulted in improvement of the morphology, impact strength and water absorbability of PA6/PPO blends (60/40, wt%), but with no favorable effects for thermal stability. However, at high SMA contents, the properties of PA6/PPO (60/40, wt%) blends deteriorated to some degree.

84916623180	Chitosan/phytic acid polyelectrolyte complex: A green and renewable intumescent flame retardant system for ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer	We describe the preparation and characterization of a green and renewable polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) containing phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon elements, based on the ionic complexation between chitosan and phytic acid. Introduction of this PEC to ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) leads to an improvement of the flame retardancy. As for the EVA/PEC composites with 20.0 wt % of PEC (EVA/20PEC), the char residue at 600 °C is 12 wt % higher than that of the pristine EVA under nitrogen atmosphere. Compared to the pristine EVA, the peak heat release rate and total heat release of EVA/20PEC show 249 W g

84919782137	Flame-retarding modification for ramie/benzoxazine laminates and the mechanism study	Flame retardant ramie/benzoxazine resin laminates were prepared and modified by ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and a nitrogen-phosphorus flame retardant (NEWRAY911). The results showed that the limiting oxygen index (LOI) values of the ramie/benzoxazine laminates could be ameliorated by the addition of APP, but did not achieve V0 level in UL94 test. Their mechanical strengths were also partially damaged. To improve the flame retardancy and reduce the mechanical damage to laminates, ramie fabric was modified by NEWRAY911 before compounding. The LOI value of the laminate made by flame retardant ramie fabric could be increased to 44.8%, and the laminates achieved V0 level in UL94 test. Compared to the unmodified laminates, the flame retarding modification of the fabric helped to improve the mechanical properties of laminates. The mechanism of flame retardancy of these laminates was investigated further by thermogravimetric analysis coupled with infrared spectroscopy, microscale combustion calorimetry measurements and scanning electron microscopy.

0347996136	Morphology Evolution of Immiscible LDPE/PVC Blends in the Presence of Compatibilizer and Phase Dispersant	Phase dispersion and coalescence in low-density polyethylene (LDPE)/polyyinyl chloride (PVC) (70/30) blends influenced by compatibilizer and phase dispersant was studied. It was found that the morphology evolution of blends is sensitive to not only processing conditions (shear strength and mixing time) but also the added compatibilizer or phase dispersant. In our conditions, the stable phase morphology of each blend is obtained after mixing 15-25 min. In addition, the dispersed PVC phase in blends is easy to aggregate when the mixing rotor speed changed from high to low for the binary blends. As a compatibilizer, chlorided polyethylene (CPE) or nitrile rubber (NBR) can stabilize the morphology and hinder the coalescence of the dispersed PVC phase when added to the blends. However, the phase dispersant butadiene rubber (BR) or styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) could not stabilize the phase structure, although it could accelerate phase dispersion. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

0942289864	Effect of compatibility on the structure of the microporous membrane prepared by selective dissolution of chitosan/synthetic polymer blend membrane	The method to prepare microporous chitosan membrane by selective dissolution of its blend was evaluated. Two synthetic polymers, e.g. polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), were chosen to be the counterpart polymers. Results of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) characterization, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis, wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements showed that there are special interactions between chitosan and the counterpart polymers. The pore structure induced by this method is controlled by the compatibility of the chitosan and the counterpart polymers. No pore structure was induced in the case of chitosan/polyvinyl pyrrolidone because of their molecule level miscibility and strong interaction. Highly porous structure was induced in the case of chitosan/polyethylene glycol because of their poor compatibility and multiphase structure. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1142268914	Novel method of preparing microporous membrane by selective dissolution of chitosan/polyethylene glycol blend membrane	Chitosan membranes with high porosity and good mechanical properties were prepared by selective dissolution of the blend membranes of chitosan (CS) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The morphology of the obtained porous membranes was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The pore size changed from 500 nm to several micrometers, depending on the molecular weight of the PEG used. The water permeability of the porous membrane depends on both the pore size and the porosity, except in the case of PEG2000, in which a higher molecular weight of PEG was used, producing greater water permeability. The tensile strength of the porous membranes obtained by this method was higher in both the wet and the dry state than that of the porous chitosan membranes prepared by using silica particles as porogen. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
