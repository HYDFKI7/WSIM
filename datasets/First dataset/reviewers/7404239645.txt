13944264277	Effecting factors on the temperature characterization in electron-beam curing of epoxy resins	The temperature characterizations of epoxy resin systems during electron-beam curing were measured by using automatic testing and collection systems. The effects of different factors, such as the chemical structures, the molecular weights of epoxy resins and the concentration of resins in the mixture with dilution were investigated. The properties of cured resins were evaluated by the gel mass fraction and the dynamic mechanical analysis. The data indicate that the rising of temperature in resins mainly results from the electron energy absorbance by the epoxy resins, in the process of EB curing, and the absorbency of resin systems depends on its chemical structures rather than the molecular weight of the epoxy oligomer. The addition of diluting agent would change the temperature characterization of resin systems and it was found that the more the concentration of the diluting agent, the higher the peak of temperature curves.

18744404258	Setup and application of a wetting property measuring instrument	A new wettability instrument was developed according to the fabrication characteristic of composites, which could measure the mass increase in fibres penetrated by resins. The instrument was composed of two parts. One was the wicking mass testing system and the other was a temperature-controlled system. It could measure the capillary impregnation of liquids in the fibre bundles with various fibre volume fractions under different temperatures. The instrument was evaluated and adjusted. Based on this, the wetting of resins in glass fibres and carbon fibres were studied. Effects of the type of fibres, the viscosity of resins and the fibre volume fraction on wicking behaviour were also investigated. The results show that this instrument provides a convenient tool for studying on wettability of the reinforced fibres probe by the resin matrix, which is valuable for guiding parameters in the process of composites.

The change trends of BPI (Ballistic Performance Indicator) data obtained from SHPB are similar to those of the ball firing data, indicating that the transverse impact test on AF/ZF hybrid composite has a certain reference value to predict the energy absorption of composites target in the ball firing.

29144462720	Effect of low profile additives on the shrinkage and mechanical properties of unsaturated polyester	In order to reduce the high shrinkage ratio and great brittleness of UPR (unsaturated polyester resin), two kinds of LPA (low profile additive), which are LPA-4016 of polyvinyl acetate and LPA-7310 of polystyrene, are added into UPR cast separately. The effects of LPA on the shrinkage rate and mechanical properties of UPR cast are studied, and then the phase structure transitions of these two systems and their different control mechanisms of low shrinkage rate are analyzed. For LPA-4016, it is by formatting amounts of uniform and disperse voids around the LPA phase to buck the shrinkage during resin cure; while for LPA-7310, this is realized primarily by the sufficient expansion of LPA itself. The results show that there exists an optimal quantity for LPA-4016 to reduce shrinkage rate of UPR, and it can improve the brittleness of UPR and increase its impact strength in contrast with LPA-7310. But both of them tend to reduce the tensile strength of UPR.

33646368111	Contact angle of epoxy resin measured by capillary impregnation and the wilhelmy technique	Good wetting plays an important role in improving the degree of adhesion at interfaces between fibres and matrices in composites. The contact angle of an epoxy resin, as a widely used polymeric matrix, was studied by impregnation in single glass capillaries at the manufacturing temperature of the composites. In order to obtain the net wicking mass for capillary experiments, the meniscus force at the bottom of the glass tube was investigated, with the help of the Wilhelmy technique, conducted by using glass sticks with various diameters. Results show that the contact angles resulting from equilibrium using both capillary impregnation and the Wilhelmy experiment are consistent, which indicates the reliability of the practical evaluation of the effect of the meniscus on the penetration mass. The contact angle of this epoxy resin was approximately 60° resulting from the equilibrium of the capillary impregnation and the Wilhelmy experiments at 80°C. © Rapra Technology Limited, 2006.

33745163569	Bubble transfiguration and moving condition in different channels	Void is one of the most important factors which affects performances of composites. The void problem is generic to most polymer composite process, regardless of whether the matrix is a thermosetting or a thermoplastics matrix. In order to eliminate porosity and promote product quality, it is essential to study the bubble traversing behavior during composites manufacturing. Using the laminate simulation systems, the configuration changing process of bubbles under different traversing channels was investigated preliminarily. Then the main factors affecting bubble traversing behavior were studied respectively, such as the bubble volume, the resin viscosity and the inter-space size. Finally the kinematic conditions for bubble traversing were also proposed. The experimental results showed that the external pressure needed for bubble traversing in the woven layers would increase with the increase in resin viscosity, the decreasing of bubble diameter and the inter-space area. These results will provide experimental bases for the establishment of bubble movement model in hot-compaction process.

33646718789	Capillary impregnation of aligned carbon fiber beds with epoxy resins	In a composite system, the adhesion at the interface between fiber and matrix plays an important role in improving the resulting mechanical behavior. However, interfacial adhesion cannot be achieved without intimate contact. Impregnation flows in T300 and T700 carbon fiber beds were tested when penetrated by a 618 epoxy resin and a AG80 epoxy resin, in both longitudinal and transverse directions. The effects of temperature and fiber volume fraction on the impregnation performance were investigated. Results show that capillary impregnation in the transverse direction is much lower than impregnation in the longitudinal direction. Different trends were found in the analysis of the effect of fiber volume fraction on capillary impregnation in these two directions. With increasing fiber volume fraction, the wicking height increases in the longitudinal impregnation, however, it decreases in the transverse impregnation.

All experiments were carried out in the three-point bending mode, at 25°C and 10 Hz. The effects of experiment parameters, such as preload, dynamic load, fiber type and modulus on dynamic viscoelasticities were investigated. The results show that the storage modulus increases with the preload, but decreases with the dynamic load, and the fiber type has little influence on the viscoelastic behavior, but the modulus influences it obviously.

33746087251	Electron-beam curing characterization of epoxy resin systems containing co-initiator	Electron beam (EB) curing of polymer matrix composites offers many particular advantages compared to conventional thermal curing. There has been a considerable development about the EB curing advanced composites for the use of aerospace and other industries in recent years. Most variety of epoxy resin has been confirmed to possess radiation reactivity and have already become chief resin matrices used in EB curable composites. The influences of initiator variety and concentration on the curing characterizations of epoxy resin system containing co-initiator benzophenone and isopropanol were analyzed. The variation regularities of temperature during the radiation, the gel fraction, damping factor and dynamic modulus of samples were studied. The experimental results indicate that under the same condition of epoxy resin content and absorbed dose, the addition of co-initiator can enhance the gel fraction of system, but the enhanced extent of gel fraction does not increase with the increase co-initiator content, there exists an optimal content of the co-initiator. With the increase of onium salt initiator, the enhanced extent of gel fraction induced by co-initiator will decrease. A temperature peak appears during the radiation, and the influences of co-initiator on the peak temperature and the glass transition temperature are the same as those on the gel fraction. The room temperature modulus and high temperature modulus of cured samples with low content of onium salt initiator have little change before and after the addition of co-initiator. When the diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate initiator content is high, the room temperature modulus of samples with co-initiator increases, while the high temperature modulus has little changes.

33751557313	Numerical simulation and experimental study on consolidation of toughened epoxy resin composite laminates	Toughened epoxy resin is one of the most important matrices in composite structural materials. In this article a one-dimensional resin flow/fiber compaction model was used for analysis of the consolidation of a toughened epoxy resin 5228/T700S carbon fiber laminates. The laminate thickness and the fiber volume fraction distribution of cured laminates under different cure cycles were investigated both from the experimental measurements and from the numerical simulation. The calculated and experimental results are in good agreement for all the studied cases. A significantly uneven degree of consolidation along the laminate thickness direction is observed, and it is difficult to improve by altering cure cycle. These results are valuable for the study of the performance of composite parts, provided that uneven distribution of fibers does affect some properties of composite materials. © 2006 SAGE Publications.

33845616670	Cure kinetics of TGDDM/DDS system studied by non-isothermal method	4,4′-tetraglycidyldiaminodiphenyl methane (TGDDM) epoxy resins are widely used in the fields of aviation and airspace owing to their excellent properties, but the physical properties of the cured epoxy resins depend on their structure, the extent of cure, the curing conditions, the time and temperature of cure. So it is necessary to study the curing kinetics in order to obtain the optimal curing process. The Curing kinetics of TGDDM in presence of 3,3′-diaminodiphenylsylfone (DDS) as the curing agent was studies by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique at different heating rates. The kinetic mechanism function was determined using n order reaction and the most probability mechanism function method given by Malek respectively, the kinetic parameters of curing reaction were determined with the kinetic analysis of the data obtained by the thermal treatment, then the kinetic model was built. The results indicated that the n order model deduced from Kissinger and Crane equation, by which the parameters of curing reaction, the reaction order and activity energy were obtained, had great distinction with the experimental data. While the Malek analytical mechanism showed that the curing process of the curing reactions followed an autocatalytic reaction. The two-parameter (m, n) autocatalytic model can well describe the curing reaction process of the studied epoxy resins. The DSC curves obtained using the experimental data showed a good agreement with that theoretically calculated under 5-20 K/min heating rate. The research results will provide theoretical basis for the choice of manufacturing process and the optimization of processing window.

33845789271	Corrosion resistance characteristic of continuous basalt fiber and its reinforcing composites	To explore the corrosion property of a new kind basalt fiber and its reinforcing composites, the basalt fiber was boiled 3 h in water, sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. The residual tensile strength and mass loss of basalt fiber after boiled were investigated. It was showed that the alkali resistance of the basalt fiber is better than acid resistance. To investigate the chemical durability of basalt composite in different mediums, samples were immersed in eight kinds of chemical mediums for 15, 30 and 90 days. After each period of immersion, the bending properties were tested and surface morphologies were observed. Study results reveal that the corrosion behavior of composite is very different in acid and alkaline due to the basalt fiber resistance difference. In acid mediums, the bending strength and bending module change in the same way. In alkaline mediums, bending module is very blunt compared with bending strength, bending module keeps close to the o-riginality while bending strength declines gradually.

33847698199	A simple method for the measurement of compaction and corresponding transverse permeability of composite prepregs	Process simulation is of great importance in the development of processes for cost-effective fabrication of composite structures, particularly for thermoset matrix composites. For the simulation of autoclave or hot press process, it requires knowledge of the compaction behavior and the saturated transverse permeability of fiber reinforcements. In this paper, a simple method without any sophisticated equipment is shown, which can simultaneously measure the compaction curve and the saturated transverse permeability as a function of fiber volume fraction. The method was used to measure the properties of S-2 glass rovings and T700S carbon rovings prepregs. The effects of the impregnating fluid variety, the initial fiber volume fraction of prepreg, and the lay-up type on the compaction behavior were investigated. The transverse permeability was also studied as a function of fiber content for various lay-up types. The results indicate that Gutowski's compaction model and the modified Kozeny-Carman equation proposed by Gutowski, which are important input parameters for the resin flow model, can be used to adequately fit the experimental data. © 2007 Society of Plastics Engineers.

The finite-element analysis was performed to investigate the stress distribution of the deformed model structure with nonuniform fiber distribution. An effect coefficient of fiber distribution R was put forward to characterize the mechanic properties of composite materials. The results show that the flexural and impact properties are greatly affected by the fiber distribution type and the loading direction, and the effect coefficient R can be used to justify the properties of the composite laminates with nonuniform fiber distribution.

34250866372	Dynamic viscoelasticity of carbon fibre reinforced polymers under high load: Effects of static and dynamic loads	The load applied on the specimen in common dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) is of the order of several Newtons to several tens of Newtons, far lower than that in service life. In this study a dynamic mechanical thermal analyser (EPLEXOR 500, with a total load up to 500 N) was applied to investigate the effects of static load and dynamic load (sine-wave load) on the dynamic viscoelasticity of unidirectional carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resin composites. The effects of the load on the dynamic viscoelasticity of polymer matrix composites (PMCs) are expressed mainly in two ways. On the one hand, the load affects the magnitude of the dynamic viscoelastic parameters. The storage modulus increases with increasing static load and decreases with increasing dynamic load. Such variations are obviously related to the interaction between the two kinds of load. The increase in load, whether static or dynamic, can result in a decline in the loss tangent. On the other hand, there exists a frequency-temperature-load equivalence for a carbon fibre-reinforced polymer's dynamic viscoelasticity. An increase in static load raises the glass-transition temperature and pushes the frequency spectrum curve towards a low frequency, while the effects of dynamic load are the reverse. ©Rapra Technology, 2007.

34548309170	Impact energy absorption and dynamic viscoelasticity of composites	The energy absorptions of composite laminates reinforced respectively by glass fiber, carbon fiber, aramid fiber, and UHMWPE fiber (separately named as GFRP, CFRP, AFRP and DFRP), were investigated under the low velocity impact. The load sensibilities on dynamic viscoelasticity of composite fiber bundles of these four kinds of fibers were analyzed by using the EPLEXOR500 dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer under high loads. The impact tests show that the impact energy absorption is close related to the fiber properties and failure modes. The impact energy absorptions of AFRP and DFRP laminates through ductile failures are much higher than those of GFRP, and CFRP laminates through brittle failures. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis of composite fiber bundles show the load effects as that storage modulus increase and loss tangents decrease with the increasing static load, while the case is just reverse with the increasing dynamic load. In these effects, the organic fibers exhibit more serious load sensibilities and non-linearity than the inorganic fibers. These four laminates show the same sequence DFRP > AFRP > GFRP > CFRP on energy absorption as the load sensibility of storage modulus or the value of loss tangent of composite fiber bundles. This indicates the correlation of the macroscopic impact performance and viscoelasticity which is close associated with material microstructure.

By using amimCl as the reaction medium, high-amylose starch acetates with a relatively wide range of degree of substitution (DS) were homogeneously synthesized by a one-step method in the absence of any catalyst. The effects of reaction time and acetic anhydride/anhydroglucose unit (AGU) molar ratio on the DS of starch acetates were investigated. These starch acetates exhibited different solubility in water, acetone and DMAc, depending on the DS value. Finally, the fibrous membranes composing of continuous and smooth fibers with diameters in a range from several tens to several hundreds nanometers were successfully produced via electrospinning of starch acetate solution.

34948894485	Microstructure and affecting factors of epoxy resin cured by electron beam radiation	A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the microstructures of cured samples after different cure time. The formation mechanism of microstructure was analyzed. The effects of molecular structure and molecular weight of epoxy resin, resin component, and radiation condition on the microstructure were also researched. The results show that the cure zone of epoxy resin consists of lamellae, and the resin molecular structure and weight have little effect on the cured microstructure. Under the electron beam radiation, epoxy resins with different structures or molecular weights all form prepolymer at first, then the prepolymer grows into network. With the radiation time increases, the network grows larger and the circular sheet forms finally. With the increasing of radiation dosage, the size of circular sheet increases. And there exists an optimum content of initiator, which makes the size of circular sheet reach the minimum.

37449007588	Experimental study on acid and alkali resistance of basalt fiber used for composites	In order to study the corrosion property of a kind of domestic continuous basalt fiber BF-CSH-01, the mass loss, monofilament strength, tensile properties of tows and flexural strength of the composites were investigated in different immersion periods of sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid of 2 mol/L at 80°C. The results indicate that the acid resistance of this basalt fiber is better than the alkali resistance, which is contrary to BF-CMD-01 basalt fiber studied before. The tensile strength of BF-CSH-01 monofilament declines synchronously with the mass in acid mediums, while the tensile strength declines intensively with the little mass change in alkali mediums. The acid and alkali have a great effect on the tensile strength of the tows and on the flexural strength of its reinforced composites. The regularity of strength is in conformity to monofilament while the modulus is insensitive.

37449015492	Dynamic viscoelasticity of composites with different specimen dimensions under high loads	The EPLEXOR 500 dynamic mechanic thermal analysis (DMTA) was used to investigate the effects of static and dynamic loads on storage modulus and loss tangent of T300/epoxy 648 in three-point bending. The results showed that the storage modulus decreases with increasing dynamic load and increases with increasing static load, and the loss tangent decreases with increase of any one of these two loads. These effects can be enhanced, especially for storage modulus, with decreasing the span or increasing the thickness or width of specimen. Such results are originated from the 'suppression effects' of all the static stresses on dynamic strain. These suppression combined with the effect of additional shear stress leads to the fact that the storage modulus increases with the increase of span, decreases of thickness and width when the static-dynamic load ratio is below a certain transition zone, while the law will turn to the reverse when the ratio is above this zone.

The effects of the deformation strain on the shape recovery rate and recovery stress are also revealed. The polymers have the PLLA crystal and the amorphous phase, which are served as the fixed phase and reversible phase, respectively. The shape recovery rate and the recovery stress are significantly affected by the compositions and the deformation strain. With the increase of the deformation strain, the shape recovery rate decrease and higher shape recovery rate can be obtained in the polymers which have higher ε-CL content. However, the variation of recovery stress with the deformation strain is quite different and the maximum recovery stress of all polymers exceeds 3 MPa. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The mechanical properties and shape memory effects are studied by means of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and tensile tests. It is found that the mechanical properties are significantly affected by the polymer compositions. With the ε-caprolactone (ε-CL) content increasing, the maximum stress decreases linearly and the strain at break increases gradually. By adjusting the compositions, the polymers exhibit excellent shape memory effects and a maximum recovery stress of about 6.2 MPa can be obtained for the PCLA70 copolymer. Structure of the polymers during the shape memory process is investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and x-ray diffraction (XRD). The polymers are observed to consist of the PLLA crystal and amorphous phase which serve as physical cross-links and reversible phase, respectively. Shape memory effect is attributed to be the deorientation of the oriented amorphous chains due to thermodynamic entropy effect. © 2007 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

It has been found that ceramic fiber-reinforced aerogels showed higher thermal conductivity than aerogel itself. Shrinkage of aerogels in chopped fiber reinforced aerogel composites showed similar tendency as pure aerogel during gelation, but the shrinkage was prohibited during supercritical drying. By contrary, in the case of sintered tile reinforced aerogel, shrinkage of aerogel was completely limited in both gelation and drying processes. Average of about 50% increase of compressive strengths of the sintered tile reinforced aerogel to sintered tiles were obtained with an average density increase of about 36%, their thermal conductivity depressed slightly.

40249119913	Chemical durability and mechanical properties of alkali-proof basalt fiber and its reinforced epoxy composites	The chemical durability and mechanical properties of a kind of alkali-proof basalt fiber BF-CMD-01 and its reinforced F46 epoxy resin matrix composites are presented. The basalt fiber was boiled in distilled water, sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid, respectively. Then the mass loss and strength change of the fibers were studied showing that the alkali resistance of the basalt fiber is better than acid resistance. The flexural properties and surface morphologies of the composites were investigated after being immersed in 8 kinds of chemical mediums for 15, 30 and 90 days. Due to the difference of basalt fiber resistance in two kinds of mediums, the composites corrosion behaviors differ greatly in acid and alkaline reactions. In acid mediums, the flexural strength and flexural modulus change in the same way. In alkaline mediums, the flexural modulus keeps close to the original value while the flexural strength declines gradually. Additionally, the mechanical properties of basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) and S-2 glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) have been tested, and analyzed contrastively. The results show that the interface formed between basalt fiber and epoxy resin is better than that of glass fiber and epoxy resin. © SAGE Publications 2008.

34249299090	Dynamic viscoelasticities of CF/GF hybrid reinforced epoxy composites under high load	The EPLEXOR 500 was used to investigate the dynamic viscoelasticities of T300/S-2 hybrid reinforced epoxy composites. The effects of the static load and dynamic load on the storage modulus, loss modulus and loss tangent of hybrid composites were studied. The effects of hybrid ratios and hybrid modes on dynamic viscoelasticities under different load levels were discussed and compared. The results show that the storage modulus of the composites with different hybrid ratios uniformly decreases with the increase of dynamic load and increases with the increase of static load. The loss modulus and loss tangent both decrease with the increase of the static or dynamic loads. The storage modulus of the hybrid composites under high load approximately conforms to the Composite Beam Theory. In the dynamic load sweep mode, the variation of loss tangent with the volume fraction of carbon fiber can still be described by the Mixture Rule, and the storage modulus of sandwich hybrid composites is much higher than that of interlaminar hybrid composites. In such sweep mode the loss tangent of sandwich hybrid composites is also larger than that of interlaminar hybrid composites, but in the static load sweep mode, the case is reverse.

The bundle strength distributions in different lengths of basalt fiber BF-CSH-01, BF-CMD-02 and BF-CAH-01 were analyzed with both the models. When the fiber and sample length change, the bundle strength transformation trends are the same in the two models. Among the three kinds of basalt fibers, the fiber BF-CSH-01 has the highest bundle strength and the fiber BF-CMD-02 has the smallest variation coefficient. For the same basalt fiber, when the sample length increases, the bundle strengths and the variation coefficients of the strength decrease. A comparison between the Weibull model and Gauss model shows that the former has the higher bundle strength and a bigger variation coefficient.

Its random copolymers, which incorporated pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and p-phenylenediamine (PPD) into the backbone, were synthesised. They are characterised in abbreviation as OPM (ODPA/PMDA-MDA) and OMP (ODPA-MDA/PPD) respectively. Oligomers with various molecular weights and components were synthesised, in order to compare the influence of the chemical structure and the crosslink density of polyimides on the final properties. MOPM, which contained an identical backbone to OPM but was terminated with a mono-nadic endcap, was also synthesised to see whether the different endcaps of oligomers could impact enhanced thermal properties. The thermo-oxidative stability, processing and mechanical properties of these polyimides were tested. The results showed that incorporation of PMDA or PPD into the ODPA-MDA homopolyimide (abbreviated as OM) could greatly enhance the Tg, while retaining comparable thermo-oxidative stability and reasonable processing properties.

45449111821	Effects of Z-pin inserting parameters on X-cor sandwich mechanical property	X-Cor sandwich composite is a novel structure which is reinforced by inserting Z-pin in the thickness direction, so that this sandwich structure has a high specific strength and specific stiffness. With different Z-pin inserting parameters, the X-Cor sandwich composites are prepared with hot press molding process. The effects of Z-pin inserting angle, inserting density and inserting direction on compression and shear properties are investigated. Results show that the Z-pin inserting parameters have great effects on X-Cor sandwich composites. The compression properties of X-Cor sandwich composites are improved by the increase of Z-pin inserting angle and density. The shear properties decrease with the increase of Z-pin inserting angle, and the shear strength and modulus reach the largest when the Z-pin inserting angle arrived 45°. Moreover, the direction of X-truss is very important to shear behavior. The shear modulus is increased with the increase of X-truss in longitudinal direction. Although the effect of inserting angle on the compression performance is contrary to that on shear behavior, both of them can reach higher values when the inserting angle is between 60° and 70°.

The differences in damage modes and evolutions were analyzed combined with the damage morphology. The unidirectional composites show a mutation mode for the damage evolution or the reduction in flexural properties, while the cross-ply or quasi-isotropy composites show a multistage progressive mode. The flexural properties clearly degrade only when the structural integrity of composites is considerably damaged. The critical impact energy to initiate reduction in flexural property of unidirectional composites is the largest and that of cross-ply composites is the smallest. In addition, for angle-laminated composites, the reduction in flexural modulus is more significant than that in flexural strength.

49549091994	Compression property analysis of X-cor sandwich composites	X-cor sandwich, a novel composite reinforced by Z-pins of X shape, can be applied in aeronautical and astronautical fields. In this article, analytical and experimental studies are carried out to examine the out-of-plane compression properties of X-cor sandwich panel. An analytical formula of equivalent out-of-plane compression modulus is derived by investigating the three dimensional model of X-cor single cell. The compression strength of X-cor is governed by the elastic buckling of Z-pin behaving as beam-column on an Winkler elastic foundation. Therefore the cooperating effects between foam and Z-pin are explained and the compression strength is predicted, and the analytical prediction rule is consistent with measured results. By means of embedding Z-pins made from CF/Epoxy in PU and PMI foams, X-cor sandwiches are prepared. Experimental results show that the out-of-plane compression property is improved by increasing the angle between Z-pin and face sheet, Z-pin's volume fraction, diameter, restriction of their ends as well as foam property. But with Z-pin getting longer, it is easier to lose stability, and the compression strength is lower.

54349119125	The characterization of mechanical and surface properties of poly (glycerol-sebacate-lactic acid) during degradation in phosphate buffered saline	The present study synthesized a poly (glycerol-sebacate-lactic acid) (PGSL) with 1:1:0.5 mole ratio of glycerol, sebacate and lactic acid and investigated the degradation characteristics of the polymer in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C in vitro by means of mass loss tests, geometry, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) measurements, tensile analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The maintained geometry, linear mass loss, and minor crack formation on the surface during degradation characterized both the bulk degradation and surface erosion of the polymer. By day 30 of degradation, the mass lost reached 16%. The elastic modulus, tensile strength and elongation at breakage of PGSL were correlative to the period of degradation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The fiber property and load pattern were considered to analyze the complicated variations in storage modulus and loss tangent with the change of loads.

67650535061	Measurements of dynamic anti-bending properties of ceramics	The three-point bending test was performed to explore the dynamic anti-bending properties of ceramic materials by the improved Hopkinson pressure bar system. The tested ceramic specimens have different static bending strengths. The dimensionless deflection and deflection rate were defined and the deflection-maximum tensile stress curves for these ceramic materials were obtained under different deflection rates. The dynamic bending strengths of these ceramic materials were determined from the obtained deflection-maximum tensile stress curves. The measured results show that the deflection rate has intense effect on dynamic bending strength of the ceramics. Analyses on the validity of the dynamic three-point bending test and the dynamic damage indicate that the critical dynamic damage factor is related to the deflection rate.

67849099105	The application of poly (glycerol-sebacate) as biodegradable drug carrier	Poly (glycerol-sebacate) (PGS) is an elastomeric biodegradable polymer which possesses the ideal properties of drug carriers. In the present study, we prepared a series of PGS implants (5-FU-PGSs) loaded with different weight percent of 5-fluorouracil (2, 5, 7.5 and 10%). We studied the infrared spectrum properties, in vitro degradation and drug release, in vivo degradation and tissue biocompatibility of 5-FU-PGSs, in order to provide detailed information for the application of PGS as biodegradable drug carrier in cancer therapy. Macroscopically, all 5-FU-PGS wafers in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) kept their geometries during the degradation period of 30 days. The in vitro degradation rates of 5-FU-PGSs were accelerated when higher concentration of 5-FU was doped. Scanning electron microscopy observation showed that the surfaces of 5-FU-PGSs with higher concentration of 5-FU had irregular pits. The cumulative drug release profiles of 5-FU-PGSs exhibited a biphasic release with an initial burst release in the first day. After 7 days, almost 100% cumulative release of 5-FU was found for all 5-FU-PGSs.The degradation rate of 5-FU-PGSs in vivo was much quicker than that in vitro. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that no remarkable inflammations were observed in the tissue surrounding 5-FU-PGS implants, suggesting 5-FU-PGSs had good biocompatibility and no tissue toxicity. In vitro anti-tumor activity assay suggested that 5-FU-PGSs exhibited anti-tumor activity through sustained-release drug mode. These results demonstrate that PGS is a candidate of biodegradable drug carriers. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

69749099449	Core crush of Nomex honeycomb sandwich structure during cocuring process with vacuum bag	By using glass fiber 120 twill fabric/epoxy 5224 as the panel and Nomex honeycomb as the core, the ability of resisting the lateral distortion of honeycomb cores was investigated. For cocuring process with the vacuum bag, a gas pressure measuring method was established and was used to study the influence factors of core internal pressure and the relationship between core internal pressure and core crush. It is found that the ability of the honeycomb core to avoid core crush is limited, especially for large core grid length and core thickness. Core internal pressure has close relation with the expansion of core gas and permeability of prepreg stack, so core internal pressure is affected significantly by the temperature cycle, the number of prepreg plies and adhesive film. Moreover, the core internal pressure plays an important role in avoiding core crush. Larger internal core pressure before prepreg gelation is helpful to preventing core crush.

The results indicate that the total surface energy in each resin system declines with the extension of time by the two test methods, and the surface energies obtained from sessile drop method is bigger in comparison with those from Wilhelmy plate method. The polar component of the total surface energy in the two resin systems declines with time elapse from the results of sessile drop. FTIR result shows that the change of polar component of the total surface energy in the epoxy 618-imidazole resin system is caused by the drop of content of hydroxyl and epoxy groups.

The consolidating process and the influencing factors of fiber distribution for the variable thickness laminates were investigated by measuring the structure of fabric in cured laminate, laminate thickness, fiber content, bleeding quantity and permeability of fabrics. The results showed that the fiber content in thick area was higher than that in thin area for cured laminates due to the two dimensional resin flow. The ratio of in-plane permeability to the permeability along thickness direction of G0827 unidirectional fabric was larger than that of G0803 satin fabric, resulting in that the fiber distribution in G0827 variable thickness laminate was more uneven. Fiber distribution without bleeder was uniform and it indicates that the two dimensional resin flow in the bleeder influences the fiber distribution remarkably.

The processing parameters of cylindroid spiral springs were determined on the basis of a large number of experiments. The influences of processing technology and structure parameters of the spring on bending resilience, bending restoration rate and tensile property were tested and analyzed. The results indicate that the bending mechanical performance is directly associated with the inside diameter of the spring, and the diameter, twisting degree and number of fiber bundle. The bending restoration rate of the spring is influenced by bending time and restoration time. The processing and structure parameters can be regulated according to specific conditions.

The variation of ballistic absorption energy as well as the adhesive bonding force between layers, the thickness and density of laminates of UD75 composites with molding pressure are studied. The results show that the tensile strength of the UHMWPE fiber strands is greatly decreased when the temperature is higher than 123°C, and the ballistic absorption energy is up to the maximum value when the molding pressure is about 12.5 MPa.

74349092323	Study on molding pressure of X-truss/foam sandwich structures	X-truss/foam sandwich structure with prominent compression and shear strength has broad application prospects as primary structure in aircraft, truck, and other fields. But unsuitable molding pressure usually causes quality defects such as poor skinĝ€"core adhesion or broken Z-pins, which seriously decreases the structures mechanical property and induces too much thickness error. In order to obtain a suitable molding pressure, the hot pressing process was analyzed. It was found that the suitable molding pressure is mainly determined by the property of the foam core, the resisting force of Z-pin inserting into the face sheets, as well as Z-pin inserting angle and density. In the calculated suitable molding pressure, X-truss/ foam sandwich structures were successfully fabricated using carbon fiber Z-pins and face sheets together with polymethacrylimide foam core. The thickness of sandwich structures and final inserting angle of Z-pins were basically consistent with the calculations.

Moisture absorption, dynamic mechanical property, flexural property and fracture morphology are adopted to analyze the effects of various factors on hygrothermal properties of composites. Results show that under different hygrothermal conditions, there are only physical changes in the composites and no obvious chemical changes happen. The domestic T300 carbon fiber/BMI resin composite has lower hygrothermal stability, which is in accordance with its poor interfacial adhesive property. The composite prepared with solution method prepreg has lower hygrothermal property than that prepared with melt method prepreg, indicating that solvent has significant effects on the interfacial and hygroscopic properties of BMI resin composites.

The results were compared with the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of unidirectional composites in the interply shear test. By means of XPS and SEM, the effect of the filament's physical and chemical surface characteristics on the IFSS of fiber/matrix was also studied. The results show that the IFSS of Twaron/epoxy is higher than that of PBO/epoxy, and the strength of UHMWPE/epoxy is too low to be measured using SFFT. And both the IFSS and the ILSS are consistent for all three kinds of organic fibers/epoxy. Fibers with higher surface chemical activity have higher IFSS.

77956941409	Void formation model and measuring method of void formation condition during hot pressing process	For resin matrix composites, voids are common defects that can seriously deteriorate the properties of the composite parts. Thus, the elimination of voids is a crucial element in controlling the manufacturing process of composite parts. This article focuses on void formation originating from hygroscopic water for resin matrix composite laminates prepared with hot pressing process. The Kardos void formation model was developed to analyze the critical resin pressure for the initiation of voids, and the influencing factors were investigated experimentally to validate the modified model. It is found that resin pressure and gel temperature are the two key parameters to control void defects and that entrapped air in prepreg stacks must be considered in the void formation model. Furthermore, a simple method was established to measure the relationship between porosity and the processing parameters, and the void formation conditions of the resin and the prepreg stack were also studied. The theoretically predicted void formation conditions and the experimental results were compatible for the studied cases. These results are valuable for eliminating void defects, optimizing processing parameters, and enhancing the performance of composite parts. POLYM. COMPOS., © 2009 Society of Plastics Engineers.

The MFK method from dynamic DSC data and the advanced MFK (AMFK) from isothermal DSC data were adopted to predict the evolution of curing degree and the relationship between activation energy and curing degree. Moreover,the curing reactions under dynamic and isothermal conditions were compared by the change of glass transition temperature and the experimental results of in situ infrared measuring method. The results show that comparing to traditional fitting model method, MFK is more suitable to predict quantitatively the curing process of epoxy resin and can provide important evidences for the study on the change of curing mechanism during curing reaction. Moreover, AMFK based on isothermal condition can predict the isothermal curing courses of two resin systems with higher accuracy. The relationships between reaction activation energy and the extent of cure obtained from dynamic and isothermal MFK are different, demonstrating that the curing mechanisms of two epoxy systems under different temperature conditions distinct. These results agree well with the vitrification effect and the evolution of epoxy group conversion under dynamic and isothermal conditions.

The mechanical properties, biodegradable properties and protein adhesion behavior of the g-MgO/PLLA nanocomposites were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that g-MgO nanoparticles could comparatively uniformly disperse in PLLA matrix. The addition of g-MgO nanoparticles to PLLA matrix improved the tensile strength and elastic modulus, whereas reduced the elongation at break. The mass loss results showed that the nanocomposites with higher g-MgO content had faster degradation rates. The in vitro pH value determination results indicated that the g-MgO nanoparticles could neutralize effectively the lactic acid resulting from the degradation of PLLA. The g-MgO/PLLA nanocomposites exhibited enhanced protein adsorption, i.e., with the increase of g-MgO content, the amount of protein adsorption increased. The (5 wt%)g-MgO/PLLA nanocomposites adsorbed 33% more protein than the pure PLLA. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.

0036410670	Effect of heat treatment on thermomechanical properties of electron beam-cured epoxy resins	The effects of thermal post-treatment on EB-cured epoxy resins have been studied. Dynamic mechanical analyses were performed on samples which differed in EB radiation dose, initiator dosage, molecular weight and distribution. When the EB-cured epoxy resins were heated, the crosslink density increased. The glass transition temperature (Tg) was shifted to a higher temperature and the storage modulus (E′) remained at a high level in the heat-treated samples with increasing temperature. But when the temperature of heat treatment exceeded the trigger temperature of the initiator, an α′-relaxation peak derived from the local thermal curing network was observed in the tan δ curve. When the crosslink density induced by radiation increased, the effect of heat treatment was weakened and the temperature of the α′-relaxation peak gradually decreased. The initiator dosage and molecular weight played an important role in determining the Tg and E′ of heat-treated samples with approximately the same radiation crosslink density. When the polydispersity increased in the heat-treated samples with the same molecular weight, a higher temperature for the Tg and the α′-relaxation peak were both shown. The crosslink density and E′ at high temperatures were higher in the heat-treated samples with broad molecular weight distribution.

By Charpy impact, the low velocity impact behavior of AF/DF composites was studied. And the high velocity impact behavior under ballistic impact was also investigated. The influence of hybrid ratio on the performances of low velocity impact and high velocity impact was analyzed, and hybrid structures with good impact properties under low velocity impact and high velocity impact were optimized. For Charpy impact, the maximal impact load increased with the accretion of the AF layers for AF/DF hybrid composites. The total impact power was reduced with the decrease of DF layers and the delamination could result in the increase of total impact power. For ballistic impact, the performance of the DF composite was better than that of the AF composite and the hybrid ratio had a crucial influence. The failure morphologies of the AF/DF hybrid composite under Charpy impact and ballistic impact were analyzed. The AF/DF hybrid composite with a suitable hybrid ratio could attain a better performance than the pure AF or DF composites.

By means of a designed processing mold and a resin pressure online measuring system, the thermal expansion pressure and the resin pressure in the prepreg stack during the process were measured and analyzed. The effects of the process gap and temperature distribution were investigated, and the consolidation degrees of cured laminates under different process conditions were studied using the micrographs of laminates. The results show that the resin pressure in prepreg stack during thermal expansion process can be measured using the resin pressure online measuring system. The process gap and the temperature distribution inside the silicon rubber strongly influence the resin pressure and the thermal expansion pressure. When the process gap is reasonable, the trend and the variation degree of the thermal expansion pressure and the resin pressure before gelation are almost consistent in zero-bleeding process. The cured laminates are compact with uniform thickness. By adding the temperature platform to reduce the temperature distribution inside the silicone rubber, the increasing speed of thermal expansion pressure can be decreased.

84863399427	The polycondensing temperature rather than time determines the degradation and drug release of poly(glycerol-sebacate) doped with 5-fluorouracil	Poly(glycerol-sebacate) (PGS) is an elastomeric biodegradable polyester that could be used as biodegradable drug carrier. We have previously prepared PGS implants doped with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU-PGSs) and found that 5-FU-PGSs exhibited an initial burst of 5-FU release during in vitro degradation. The synthesis temperature and time are two of the most important reaction conditions for polymer synthesis. Therefore, in order to establish a controllable drug-release manner, we prepared a series of 5-FU-PGS with 2% weight of 5-FU under synthesis conditions with different polycondensing temperature and time and characterized the infrared spectrum properties, in vitro degradation and drug release. Results showed that the polycondensing temperature determined the mechanical properties, degradation and drug release of 5-FU-PGSs. With the polycondensing temperature increasing, the elastic modulus and hardness of 5-FU-PGSs increased, and the mass loss and 5-FU release rate decreased. The polycondensing time had no significant influence on the mechanical property, degradation and drug release of 5-FU-PGSs. We suggest that the polycondensing temperature is the factor to control the drug-release manner. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012.

Furthermore, the dynamic model has been checked to find agreement with ballistic tests. The dynamic model will be very helpful in the estimation of ballistic impact properties and optimum design of the ceramic/FRP hybrid composites.

The CNTs-glass fiber/epoxy resin laminates filled with 0.01% mass fraction of CNTs were fabricated using vacuum assisted resin infusion molding (VARIM). The effects of CNTs with the two dispersing methods on the mechanical properties of composite laminates and the enhancing mechanism of CNTs were investigated. The results show that the ultrasonic disruption can shorten the CNTs and improve their dispersion state in the resin.compared with the CNTs dispersed by the ultrasonic agitation, the influences of the CNTs dispersed by the ultrasonic disruption on the increasing viscosity and curing reaction of epoxy resin are more obvious. The flexural property, interlaminar shear strength of the laminates and the bonding strength between the resin and the glass fiber are improved using double VARIM, while the CNTs enhancing effects are not significant using single VARIM. This outcome demonstrates that due to the filter effect of fibers, low content of CNTs can increase the properties of composite laminates molded using VARIM with suitable infusion molding and dispersing method of CNTs.

In addition, thermal performances were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and vertical burning method. It is found that as heterogeneous nucleation agents, MWCNTs increase cell density and decrease cell size of the produced foams, and that as reinforcements located in cell walls, MWCNTs impart high strength and stiffness to brittle foams. Moreover, MWCNTs reinforced foams have higher thermal stability than raw foams and exhibit similar excellent resistance to flame, confirming the effectiveness of MWCNTs as stabilizers. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The applicability of the compacting pressure measuring system in autoclave processing was studied. The variation of compacting pressure in autoclave processing for L-shaped carbon fiber/epoxy laminates and the effects of mold configurations were investigated using the measuring system. The results show that the measuring system is accurate and is good in dynamic response. It can be used in high temperature and measure the compacting pressure on curved surfaces. These properties meet the requirements of compacting pressure on-line measuring for composites in autoclave processing. The compacting pressures at the corner and in the flat section for L-shaped composite laminates increase with the autoclave pressure during fabrication, but their increasing speeds and the final values are different. The compacting pressure at the corner is larger than that in the flat section during convex tool molding, while the compacting pressure at the corner is less than that in the flat section and the external pressure during concave tool molding. These experimental results demonstrate that the compacting behavior in curved part is different from that in flat structure.

The reinforcement mechanism of CNT-COOH was investigated by analyzing FTIR and detailed failure behavior of 0.05%(mass fraction) CNT-COOH/phenolic foam composite and phenolic foam under different compressive strains. It is found that serving as the site of heterogeneous nucleation, CNT-COOH increases the cell density and decreases the cell size of the produced foams, and that CNT-COOH reinforced foams are evidently stiffer and stronger than the corresponding neat system as the increment of CNT-COOH content. FTIR reveals that curing reaction of CNT-COOH and phenolic resin may not exist. SEM analysis of the composite foams in different compressive strains reveals that adding CNT-COOH located in the cell walls could endure a certain load through the interface between CNT-COOH and phenolic resin, thereby enhancing the compressive strength of CNT-COOH/phenolic foam composites. In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and vertical burning method show that CNT-COOH as stabilizer, reduces thermal degradation rate, leading to slightly higher thermal stability and resistance to flame of the foam composites.

84888122303	Effect of chemical treatment and water absorption on properties of sisal fiber and its interface with resin	Sisal fibers with surface treatments, including potassium permanganate, sodium hydroxide, flame retardant agent, silane, and without treatment were investigated. The tensile properties and interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of sisal fiber with modified acrylate and epoxy resin were tested by using single fiber tensile method and micro-droplet debonding method, respectively. The effect of water absorption on the sisal fiber surface morphologies, the tensile properties and its interfacial adhesion were analyzed, and the corresponding fracture mode as well. The results show that after chemical treatments the tensile strength and modulus of sisal fibers are decreased to varying degrees. Compared with the untreated sisal fiber, the tensile strengths of potassium permanganate and silane treated fibers both decrease by 44%, the strength of sodium hydroxide treated fiber decreases by 27%, while that of flame retardant treated fiber is almost equivalent. The chemical treatments can decrease the IFSS of sisal fiber/modified acrylate and the decreasing degrees are different from those of the fiber tensile properties, in which lowest IFSS is found for flame retardant sisal fiber/modified acrylate with 2.0 MPa, decreasing by 80% in comparison with the untreated fiber system. After silane treatment, the water absorption rate is decreased, and the property retention rate is higher for the sisal fiber than those of the untreated fiber. For the hygrometric state sisal fiber/epoxy, the untreated fiber system shows IFSS of 6.6 MPa, higher than the silane treated fiber system. The fracture morphologies indicate that silane treatment tends to reduce the bonding of the inter-fibrils, thereby decreasing the sisal fiber tensile and interfacial properties with resin.

PGSs with different proportion of glycerol and sebacic acid were synthesized by polycondensation reaction. The microstructure of the series PGSs were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Results showed that, with the increase of the ratio of sebacic acid in PGS from 1:0.8, 1:1, to 1:1.2 (ratio of glycerol to sebacic acid), the main diffraction peak in XRD, the sol content and gel swelling increased but then decreased, suggesting that the degree of crosslinking and the inherent degree of order of the series PGS increased and then decreased. With the increase of sebacic acid proportion, water absorption increased and then decreased, and the water absorption ranged from 9.62% to 10.66%. The mass loss of the series of samples in degradation experiments ranged from 24.63% to 40.06% on the 32nd day of degradation. Cell culture data suggested that the polymer with the ratio of 1:0.8 for glycerol and sebacate was suitable for cell adhesion and growth. In conclusion, PGS can be used as the cell culture matrix by modifying the composition ratio of glycerol and sebacic acid to improve the properties of cell adhesion and growth.

11144223886	Factors effecting on the wicking of epoxy resin in capillaries of unidirectional fiber bundles	Understanding the wetting behavior of resin in fiber assemblies is critical for predicting and improving the fabrication performance of composites. According to capillary rise method, the wicking flow in unidirectional fiber bundles was characterized through measuring the mass gain in fibers at different time. The effects of many factors on the wicking performance of epoxy resin in unidirectional fiber bundles were investigated, such as the volume fraction of fibers, the type of fibers, the temperature of resins and the sizing on fibers. The experimental data suggest that the wicking velocity of resins could be increased with the increase of fiber volume fraction, with enhancing temperature and by removing the sizing on S-2 glass fibers.
