84947485014	Cardiac endothelial cell-derived exosomes induce specific regulatory B cells	The mechanism of immune tolerance is to be further understood. The present study aims to investigate the role of the Cardiac endothelial cell (CEC)-derived exosomes in the induction of regulatory B cells. In this study, CECs were isolated from the mouse heart. Exosomes were purified from the culture supernatant of the primary endothelial cells. The suppressor functions of the regulatory B cells were determined by flow cytometry. The results showed that the CEC-derived exosomes carried integrin αvβ6. Exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced B cells to express the latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, the latter was converted to the active form, TGF-β, by the exosome-derived αvβ6. The B cells released TGF-β in response to re-exposure to the exosomes in the culture, which suppressed the effector T cell proliferation. We conclude that CEC-derived exosomes have the capacity to induce B cells with immune suppressor functions.

34548493889	Is it possible to obtain "true endothelial progenitor cells" by in vitro culture of bone marrow mononuclear cells?	In vitro-cultured bone marrow cells have been shown to contain some low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake-positive cells. Although a small portion of LDL uptake-positive cells had expression for endothelial markers, all of them demonstrated a phagocytosis function similar to monocyte/macrophages and expression of the panleukocyte surface marker CD45 and monocyte marker CD14. These LDL uptake-positive cells did not show significant proliferative capacity and died out gradually in long-term culture. In contrast, the bone marrow-derived LDL uptake-negative cells showed strong proliferation and expression of typical mesenchymal surface markers CD29 and CD44. Although cultured under endothelial promoting conditions, these mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) did not show any sign of differentiation toward endothelial cells. In conclusion, adult bone marrow-derived LDL uptake-positive cells that have been reported so far actually are monocytes/macrophages that can express some endothelial markers but are not "true endothelial progenitor cells" (EPCs). MSCs, which are the only cell type that shows strong proliferation during long-term adherent culture for bone marrow cells, do not differentiate toward the endothelial lineage when grown under endothelial promoting conditions. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

34948883406	Early and middle outcomes of total arterial revascularization using exclusively internal mammary artery and radial artery	Objective: To evaluate the early and mid-results of the use of the radial artery alongside the internal mammary artery for complete arterial revascularization in coronary bypass surgery. Methods: From January 1999 to January 2005, 123 patients with coronary artery disease with lesions in more than one branch (target vessel), 114 males and 9 females, aged 51.9 ± 9.4 (32 - 74) underwent coronary artery surgery after the complete arterial revascularization pattern. Before the operation the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) value ranged 30% ∼78%, and 24 patients (21.1%) had poor ejection fraction (with the EF < 50%). Sixty-four patients (52%) had previous myocardial infarction. Four patients with unstable angina received urgent operation. 36 patients (29.3%) had disease of the left main trunk. 74% of the patients underwent off-pump bypass technique. The mean number of distal anastomoses was 2.6 ± 0.4 per patient 20 patients were followed up for 62 ± 12.8 months (36 ∼ 80 months). Results: The early mortality was 0.8%. Postoperative complications included arterial fibrillation in seven patients (5.7%). One patient underwent IABP insertion because of low cardiac output, 3 patients were re-admitted because of heart failure, angina and arrhythmias. Three patients died of cardiac events. One patient underwent redo-CABG due to recurrent myocardial infarction and one patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention because of stenosis of the arterial graft. Conclusions: Complete arterial revascularization using radial and mammary arteries provides excellent early results, showing a low mid-term complication rate and surgical morbidity.

39749137534	Development of a novel axial flow ventricular assist device and its preliminary animal experiment	Objective: To design and develop blood pumps for left ventricular assist devices. Methods: Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), five-axis machine, a prototype of the pump has been designed and fabricated. The pump has been used to conduct in vitro experiments to evaluate the performance of hydraulic performance. The pump has also been tested for hemolysis characteristic through animal experiment. Results: At 9000r/min, the pump generates more than 5L/min flow against 100mmHg. The plasma free hemoglobin was 0.05g/dL. Conclusions: The results obtained from the prototype hydraulic testing and hemolysis testing indicated an acceptable design for the blood pump, representing a significant step in the development phase of this device.

41349095070	Design optimization of an axial blood pump with computational fluid dynamics	A fully implantable, axial flow blood pump has been developed in our hospital. Both in vitro and in vivo tests showed that the hemolysis and thrombus characteristics of the pump were in an acceptable but not in an ideal range. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and in vitro test results showed that the pump worked at off-design point with a low hydraulic efficiency; CFD analysis also showed regions of reverse flow in the diffuser, which not only decreases the pump's hydrodynamic efficiency, but also increases its overall potential for blood trauma and thrombosis. To make a blood pump atraumatic and nonthrombogenic, several methods were taken to reach a final model of the optimized blood pump using CFD, which decreased the rotational speed from 9,000 to 8,000 rpm, and the design flow rate from 11 to 6 L/min. More significantly, the flow separation and recirculation in the diffuser region were eliminated, which mitigated the traumatic and thrombus effect on blood. The acceptable results of the numerical simulations encourage additional in vitro and in vivo studies. ©2008Amercian Society of Artificial Internal Organs.

58049164219	Validation of a newly proposed risk-predictive model of coronary artery bypass graft surgery in the Chinese population	Background: This research was aimed at validating a new risk model for in-hospital mortality in Chinese patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. This model (NYS), which was developed for isolated CABG surgery from data of New York's cardiac surgery reporting system in 2002, was proved effective, but its validation in Chinese patients has yet to be carried out. Methods: The original model was recalibrated, and the fitness of the recalibrated model was tested in the Chinese Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Registry. From January 2004 to December 2005, 9248 patients undergoing CABG were enrolled in the Chinese CABG Registry, and 8120 patients who underwent isolated CABG were selected for the current study. Results: The C statistic value for the original model was 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.78), and the χ

59549101926	Design and performance testing of an axial-flow ventricular assist device developed at the Fu Wai Hospital in Beijing	Purpose: Various ventricular assist devices (VADs) have been developed for clinical use in recent years. The aim of a multidisciplinary research team at the Fuwai Hospital of the Peking Union Medical College is to design and develop an axial flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for adults. Methods: Using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), the inflow characteristics of the axial flow pump were analyzed. After CFD analysis, the axial pump was fabricated using a 5-axis, computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine. Performances of the pump both in vitro and in vivo were tested. Results: This VAD, which was developed after numerous CFD analyses for the flow characteristics of the pump, is 58.5 mm long, 30 mm wide and weighs 120 g. The pump can deliver 5 lpm for pressures of 100 mmHg over 8500 rpm. The NIH value was 0.01 g/100 L. The hemolysis, which was evaluated in an in vivo test, was a bit higher than the normal value, but remained within an acceptable range. Conclusions: Performance of the pump in vitro and in vivo was considered sufficient for an LVAD. Further design improvements are being undertaken in terms of hemolysis and thrombosis to improve the biocompatibility of the pump. © Wichtig Editore, 2008.

79952350278	Comparison between drug-eluting stents and coronary artery bypass grafting for unprotected left main coronary artery disease: A meta-analysis of two randomized trials and thirteen observational studies	Objective: The clinical outcomes for unprotected left main coronary artery (LMCA) between coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and drug-eluting stents (DES) are still controversial. The objective was to compare safety and efficacy between DES and CABG for unprotected LMCA. Methods: Electronic databases and article references were systematically searched (2000-2010) to access relevant studies. Results: Fifteen studies with 5,479 patients were finally involved in the present study. The mortality was similar in DES and CABG groups at 1 year [odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.71 (0.5-1.03)], 2 years [1.28 (0.93-1.76)], 3 years [0.88 (0.53-1.46)], 4 years [0.46 (0.18-1.17)], and 5 years [1.16 (0.85-1.57)]. No significant difference was found between DES and CABG in the risk of composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events during 5 years' follow-up [1 year, 0.95 (0.63-1.43); 2 years, 1.34 (0.67-2.57); 3 years, 1.06 (0.59-1.90); 4 years, 0.53 (0.26-1.08); 5 years, 0.83 (0.33-2.07)]. However, the risk of repeat revascularization was significantly higher in the DES group than the CABG group at 1 year [5.00 (2.85-8.77)], 2 years [4.79 (2.72-8.45)], 3 years [5.72 (3.07-10.65)], 4 years [2.16 (1.17-4.01)], and 5 years [5.65 (3.44-9.27)]. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis indicates that there are no significant differences in the safety between CABG and DES in patients with unprotected LMCA in the 5 years after intervention. But CABG is superior to DES for repeat revascularization. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.

84877772932	MicroRNA profiling during rat ventricular maturation: A role for miR-29a in regulating cardiomyocyte cell cycle re-entry	Recent studies demonstrated that the mammalian heart possesses some capacity to proliferate. We observed cardiomyocyte proliferation within 4 weeks of age (P4W) in rats. We found 95 microRNAs that are differentially expressed in P4W cardiomyocytes. MicroRNA-29a was among the most highly up-regulated microRNAs in P4W cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of microRNA-29a suppressed the proliferation of H9c2 cell line. MicroRNA-29a inhibition induced cardiomyocytes to proliferate, accelerated the G1/S and G2/M transition, and up-regulated the cell cycle gene expression. Cyclin D2 (CCND2) was identified as a direct target of microRNA-29a. These findings indicate that microRNA-29a is involved in cardiomyocyte proliferation during postnatal development.

84876737859	Effects of retrograde autologous priming on blood transfusion and clinical outcomes in adults: A meta-analysis	Objective: Reducing the priming volume is an effective means of decreasing hemodilution and blood transfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The patient's own blood was used to replace the crystalloid in the CPB circuit by retrograde autologous priming (RAP) in order to decrease the priming volume. Therefore, we performed a metaanalysis to investigate whether RAP could reduce blood transfusion and improve clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted for randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) exploring RAP in PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and Chinese literature databases (WanFang, WeiPu and CNKI). Clinical parameters and outcomes were focused on the lowest hematocrit (Hct) during CPB, the number of patients transfused blood intraoperatively, the number of patients transfused blood perioperatively, the number of blood units transfused, 24-hour chest tube drainage, hours to extubation, length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay. Results: Ten trials, with a total of 1123 patients, were included. The number of patients transfused blood intraoperatively (RR = 0.39, 95% CI = [0.29, 0.53], p<0.00001, I2 = 40%) and perioperatively (RR = 0.53, 95% CI = [0.43, 0.66], p<0.00001, I2 = 0%) and the number of blood units transfused (SMD = -0.53, 95% CI = [-0.73, -0.33], p<0.00001, I2 = 14%) were all significantly reduced in the RAP group. No differences in the hours to extubation (SMD = -0.11, 95% CI = [-0.33, 0.12], p=0.37, I2 = 0%) and the length of ICU stay (SMD = -0.17, 95% CI = [-0.41, 0.08], p=0.18, I2 = 0%) were observed between the two groups. Conclusion: Compared to conventional priming, RAP could reduce transfusion in adults significantly, but had no effect on clinical outcomes, comparing to conventional priming. Further studies involving RAP are expected to investigate if this technique is beneficial to the patient. © The Author(s) 2013.

84876805834	Efficacy of Carbon Dioxide Insufflation for Cerebral and Cardiac Protection During Open Heart Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	In spite of widespread application around the world, there has been controversy on the cerebral and cardiac protection efficacy of carbon dioxide insufflation (CDI) during open heart surgery. To make a comprehensive evaluation, we screened all relevant published randomized controlled trials to perform the first systematic review and meta-analysis for CDI during open heart surgery. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trial register, WANFAN, CQVIP, and CNKI database for published articles. Randomized controlled trials were included when the research provided data of neurological complications postoperatively, creatinine kinase, MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) on the first postoperative day, or all-cause mortality. We chose a fixed-effects model when the trials showed low heterogeneity, otherwise a random effects model was used. The quality of studies was assessed by modified Jadad scale. Four studies were included in this meta-analysis. The overall pooled relative risk (RR) for neurological complications was 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI)=[0.57, 4.46], and the z-score for overall effect was 0.89 (P=0.37). The standardized mean difference of the CK-MB between groups was 1.15, 95% CI=[-1.27, 3.56], and the z-score for overall effect was 0.93 (P=0.35). The overall pooled RR for all-cause mortality was 0.5, 95% CI=[0.16, 1.64], and the z-score for overall effect was 1.14 (P=0.25). There was no significant difference between groups. Because of the insufficiency of powerful evidences, the cerebral and cardiac protection efficacy of CDI during open heart surgery needs to be further verified by more high-quality trials. © 2013, International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84925883758	Cardiomyocyte cytokinesis score: A potential method for cardiomyocyte proliferation	One of the most important indicators of myocardial regeneration is cardiomyocyte proliferation. However, it is difficult to distinguish cardiomyocytes in the regenerating stage from binucleated or multinucleated myocytes by conventional morphometric techniques. As cell cycle progression (CCP) scores have been successfully applied to the evaluation of the proliferation of cancer cells, we sought to establish a multi-gene score to evaluate cardiomyocyte proliferation in this study. Given the disturbances of nuclear division without cell division that occurs in cardiomyocytes, ten cytokinesis-correlated genes (Anln, Aurkb, Cenpa, Kif4, Kif23, Prc1, RhoA, Spin1, TACC2, and CDC42) were chosen to establish the cardiomyocyte cytokinesis score (CC-Score). The expression levels of these genes in H9C2 rat cardiomyoblast cells, the proliferation of which were stimulated or inhibited, were detected using qRT-PCR. To confirm the feasibility of the CC-Score system, four conventional methods for evaluating cardiomyocyte proliferation, including the MTT assay, BrdU assay, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry analysis, were used in each group. The results of the CC-Score in the assessment of the proliferation of H9C2 cells were consistent with those of four commonly used proliferative assay methods. We conclude that the CC-Score can be used to assess the proliferation status of H9C2 cells, and suggest that the CC-Score may be a potential method for the assessment of cardiomyocyte proliferation in myocardial regeneration. However, validation studies utilizing primary cultured rat cardiomyocytes and heart tissue are warranted.

48949105280	Arterial-venous endothelial cell fate is related to vascular endothelial growth factor and Notch status during human bone mesenchymal stem cell differentiation	Human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) can differentiate into endothelial cells (ECs), so we aimed to investigate whether hMSCs could also differentiate into a specific arterial or venous ECs. hMSCs were induced to differentiate into ECs using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Low VEGF concentration (50 ng/ml) upregulated the venous marker gene EphB4, however high concentration (100 ng/ml) upregulated the arterial marker genes ephrinB2, Dll4 and Notch4, and downregulated the venous marker genes EphB4 and COUP-TFll. This VEGF dose-dependent induction was largely blocked by inhibition of the Notch pathway in hMSCs treated with γ-secretase inhibitor. Therefore, differentiation of hMSCs into arterial- or venous-specific ECs depends on VEGF and is regulated by the Notch pathway. © 2008.

52049117151	Early and long-term outcomes in the elderly: Comparison between off-pump and on-pump techniques in 1191 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting	Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting on early and long-term mortality and morbidity in a consecutive series of elderly patients (aged > 65 years) compared with conventional coronary artery bypass grafting. Methods: From January of 1999 to December of 2003, data were extracted for 1191 patients aged more than 65 years: a conventional coronary artery bypass grafting group (n = 744) and an off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting group (n = 447). Age-related early outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and postoperative morbidities. Long-term outcomes, including total mortality, repeated revascularization, Q-wave myocardial infarction, stroke, readmission, and the combination of death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeated revascularization, were evaluated with Cox regression analysis. Results: Univariate analysis for early outcomes showed significant benefits from off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, there was still a benefit of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses (propensity matched cases) showed that stroke, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, and readmission occurred more frequently in the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting group (P < .001). There was a nonsignificant trend to higher total mortality (P = .193) and higher repeated revascularization rates (P = .067) in the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting group. Cox regression for long-term outcomes showed that patients in the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting group had a higher incidence of stroke (hazard ratio 2.611, 95% confidence interval 2.152-3.070), readmission (hazard ratio 2.000, 95% confidence interval 1.747-2.253), and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio 1.764, 95% confidence interval 1.456-2.072). Conclusion: Our analysis shows that off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting compared with conventional coronary artery bypass grafting was associated with favorable early outcomes in the elderly population. However, the early benefits of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting were not maintained in the long term, and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting showed trends toward worse long-term results. © 2008 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

56149091721	MicroRNA: Novel regulators involved in the remodeling and reverse remodeling of the heart	Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cardiovascular research. However, the association between miRNAs and heart remodeling/reverse remodeling has not been evaluated. Methods: Lewis rats were divided into three groups: control animals, animals subjected to abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) and those with heterotopic transplantation of abdominal aortic constriction (AAC-HT), respectively. The cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and changes in the heart cavity were determined. miRNA microarray was used to search for changes in miRNAs during hypertrophy and in the unloading heart, which was also verified using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: The AAC-HT group exhibited a 54% decrease in the cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area compared to the AAC group. In the two test groups, miRNA microarrays revealed changes in 293 miRNAs, among which 40 miRNAs changed >2-fold. Some major changes were also confirmed using qRT-PCR primers. The results indicated that changes in miR-23a and miR-29a were most significant, thus suggesting that these miRNAs may play important roles in heart remodeling and reverse remodeling. Conclusions: The changes observed in miRNA expression during hypertrophy and reverse remodeling may indicate possibly meaningful targets for regulating the remodeling or reverse remodeling of the heart.

57549110650	The Chinese Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Registry Study: how well does the EuroSCORE predict operative risk for Chinese population?	Objective: The European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) model is a widely used risk prediction algorithm for cardiac surgery in China due to lack of a local model, although its validation has never been tested. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the logistic EuroSCORE when applied in the Chinese Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Registry database, which is representative of adult cardiac surgery in China. Methods: The logistic EuroSCORE model was applied to all patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery at 35 centres in China between January 2004 and December 2005. The entire cohort and a subgroup of patients undergoing isolated CABG were analysed. The calibration of the EuroSCORE model was assessed by comparing observed and predicted in-hospital mortalities. Discrimination was tested by determining the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: The Chinese CABG Registry Study recruited 9248 patients. There were significant differences in the prevalence of risk factors between the Chinese population and European cardiac surgical populations. For the entire cohort, the predicted mortality was 5.51% and observed mortality was 3.27%. Of the isolated CABG subset of 8120 patients, the predicted mortality was 4.21% and the observed mortality was 2.22%. The logistic EuroSCORE overpredicted observed mortality for the entire cohort and the isolated CABG subset at all risk tertiles to different degrees. The discriminative power of EuroSCORE was acceptable but not very satisfactory, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.72 for the entire cohort and 0.71 for the isolated CABG subset. Conclusion: EuroSCORE model does not accurately predict outcomes in this group of Chinese CABG patients. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using it for risk prediction in China. Creation of a new model, which accurately predicts outcomes in Chinese CABG patients, is warranted. © 2008 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.

62949200556	Impact of Renal Dysfunction on Long-Term Survival After Isolated Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery	Background: Preoperative renal dysfunction has been an important predictor for adverse cardiovascular events after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). In the past, serum creatinine was widely used to assess renal function. Until recently, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was recommended in evaluating renal function. The Cockcroft-Gault formula and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation are two widely used formulas in clinical practice. Which method best predicts long-term outcome after CABG is still unknown. This study compared the predictive effectiveness of the Cockcroft-Gault formula, the MDRD equation, and serum creatinine level for in-hospital and long-term mortality. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data collected from 5559 patients who underwent isolated CABG at Fuwai Hospital from January 1999 to December 2005. The main outcomes were in-hospital and long-term mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Cox analysis were used for the comparison. Results: Mean follow-up was 56.5 ± 24.6 months. ROC curve analysis showed that the Cockcroft-Gault formula had the greatest accuracy for predicting in-hospital mortality (area under the curve, 0.755; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that the eGFR based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula was an independent predictor of in-hospital (odds ratio, 4.51, p < 0.001) and long-term (hazard ratio, 1.54; p = 0.003) mortality. Both formulas were better than the serum creatinine level. Conclusions: Both formulas could provide a better measure of risk assessment than serum creatinine for in-hospital and long-term mortality. The Cockcroft-Gault formula was better than the MDRD equation for predicting in-hospital mortality. © 2009 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

63049110708	Impact of Off-Pump Techniques on Sex Differences in Early and Late Outcomes After Isolated Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts	Background: Off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery (OPCAB) is associated with lower early mortality and benefits women disproportionately. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of off-pump techniques on sex differences in late outcomes. Methods: We reviewed a clinical database of consecutive patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) at FuWai Hospital from 1999 to 2005. Logistic regression analysis and proportional hazards modeling were used to investigate whether sex or surgery type were associated with early mortality and late outcomes (mortality, major cardiac and cerebral event). Results: Female sex was associated with higher rates of early death (adjusted odds ratio, 4.726; p < 0.0001), and OPCAB benefited women disproportionately for early mortality. Odds ratio of death for women versus men was 4.726 (p < 0.0001) in the conventional CABG on cardiopulmonary bypass group; odds ratio of death for women versus men was 1.344 (p = 0.5617) in the OPCAB group. Analysis of late outcomes indicated that OPCAB and cardiopulmonary bypass resulted in similar survival, regardless of sex. The women versus men hazard ratio of late mortality after CABG on cardiopulmonary bypass and OPCAB for women was 0.851 (p = 0.4984) and 0.650 (p = 0.2005), respectively. Women treated with OPCAB were less likely to be free from major cardiac and cerebral events than men treated with OPCAB. The women versus men hazard ratio of major cardiac and cerebral events after CABG on cardiopulmonary bypass and OPCAB for women was 1.079 (p = 0.4992) and 1.299 (p = 0.0387), respectively. Conclusions: Compared with men, women are a high-risk group and benefit from off-pump operation in terms of early mortality after CABG. Conversely, during follow-up, women have high adjusted risks of major cardiac and cerebral events after OPCAB. © 2009 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

62449149647	In vivo experimental testing of the fw axial blood pump for left ventricular support in Fu Wai hospital	A fully implantable, axial flow blood pump has been developed in Fu Wai Hospital aiming for clinical use. This ventricular assist device (VAD), which was developed after numerous CFD analyses for the flow characteristics of the pump, is 58.5-mm long, 30-mm wide (including DC motor), and weighs 240 g. The pump can deliver 5 L/min for pressures of 100 mm Hg over 8,000 rpm. In this study, short-term hemocompatibility effects of the axial left ventricular assist device (LVAD) (FW blood pump) were evaluated in four healthy sheep. The device was implanted into the left ventricular apex of beating hearts. The outflow graft of each device was anastomosed to the descending aorta. The hemolysis, which was evaluated in vivo by free hemoglobin value, was below 30 mg/dL. Evaluation of serum biochemical data showed that implantation of the FW blood pump in sheep with normal hearts did not impair end organ function. Gross and microscopic sections of kidney, liver, and lung revealed no evidence of microemboli. Performance of the pump in vivo was considered sufficient for a LVAD, although further design improvement is necessary in terms of hemolysis and antithrombosis to improve biocompatibility of the pump. © 2009 Amercian Society of Artificial Internal Organs.

65449184606	Comparison of drug-eluting stents and coronary artery bypass surgery for the treatment of multivessel coronary disease three-year follow-up results from a single institution	BackgroundNumerous studies have compared the outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and coronary stenting for the treatment of multivessel coronary disease. In 2003, drug-eluting stents were introduced with the hope of reducing restenosis. However, limited information exists on the comparison of drug-eluting stents and CABG surgery. The long-term outcome of drug-eluting stents compared with that of CABG surgery is also unclear. Methods and ResultsWe identified 3720 consecutive patients with multivessel disease who underwent isolated CABG surgery or received drug-eluting stents between April 1, 2004, and December 31, 2005, and we compared safety (total mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke) and efficacy (target-vessel revascularization) during a 3-year follow-up. These outcomes were compared after adjustment for differences in baseline risk factors. Patients who underwent CABG (n=1886) were older and had more comorbidities than patients who received drug-eluting stents (n=1834). Patients receiving drug-eluting stents had considerably higher 3-year rates of target-vessel revascularization. Drug-eluting stents were also associated with higher rates of death (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 2.47) and myocardial infarction (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.15 to 2.44). The risk adjusted rate of stroke was similar in the 2 groups (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.69 to 1.51). ConclusionsIn a cohort of patients with multivessel disease, CABG was associated with lower rates of death, myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularization than drug-eluting stents.

Two years later, a pathologic fracture revealed osseous metastasis, and intracardiac recurrence was detected by echocardiography. The patient died of multiple organ failure in the end. This case is an unusual presentation of complete course of cardiac rhabdomyosarcoma (CR) from diagnosis, operation, recurrence, and metastasis to death. Although primary CR is highly lethal, operation should be indicated to clarify the diagnosis, relieve symptoms, and improve short-term survival. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

67650078270	The Chinese coronary artery bypass grafting registry study: Analysis of the national multicentre database of 9248 patients	The past decade in China has heralded a rapid increase in surgical coronary revascularisation, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has now been possible in an increasingly high-risk population in China. However, little is known about the current status of CABG surgery in contemporary China. The European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) was introduced to China for risk adjustment in 2000 due to the absence of a local risk prediction model. Now, it is the most widely used risk prediction algorithm in China. Fuwai Hospital, Beijing, China has developed a national multicentre database of CABG patients, named the Chinese CABG Registry Study. We embarked on this study with a view to establishing risk stratification and outcome assessment following CABG in Chinese adults as well as to provide a potential clinical research tool for the future. The database will then serve to validate the widely used EuroSCORE model in Chinese patients and to develop a risk prediction model for Chinese patients undergoing CABG.

69249151709	Surgery of left ventricular aneurysm: A propensity score-matched study of outcomes following different repair techniques	To evaluate early and late outcomes of modified left ventricular reconstruction (VR) and linear repair (LR) of post-infarct left ventricular aneurysm (LVA). A total of 514 patients were consecutively operated on for LVA with modified VR technique in 145 and LR in 352 patients. Using the propensity score-matching method, we selected 202 patients (101 LRs vs. 101 VRs) with similar pre- and intra-operative characteristics and compared their clinical outcomes. After matching, the two groups of patients were similar with regard to baseline data. The increment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in VR group was more significant than that in LR group. Operative mortality was 2.0% (2.0% LRs vs. 2.0% VRs, P=NS). There was a statistically significant difference between LR and VR patients in MACCEs (29.7% LRs vs. 13.9% VRs, P<0.01) and hospital readmissions (51.5% LRs vs. 30.7% VRs, P<0.01). Overall long-term mortality and cardiac mortality were the same between the two groups (mortality: 11.9% LRs vs. 11.9% VRs, P=NS; cardiac mortality: 9.9% LRs vs. 7.9% VRs, P-NS). The technique of repairing LVA did not affect the early and later mortality.

70349227137	A comparison before and after aprotinin was suspended in cardiac surgery: Different results in the real world from a single cardiac center in China	Objective: Use of aprotinin has been suspended in cardiac surgery since recent studies reported its risks associated with mortality and other adverse events. This study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of aprotinin through a comparison before and after aprotinin was suspended in cardiac surgery. Methods: We designed a case-control study in two groups of patients who underwent cardiac surgery just before and after aprotinin was suspended in China. The aprotinin group (n = 1699) was defined as operations performed from June 19, 2007, to December 18, 2007, when aprotinin was used in all the patients. The control group (n = 2225) was defined as operations performed from December 19, 2007, to June 18, 2008, when aprotinin was not used. We compared early postoperative outcomes between the two groups. Results: The aprotinin group had less postoperative blood loss, transfusion requirement, and reoperation for bleeding. Application of aprotinin did not increase the risk of in-hospital mortality (0.5% vs 1.0%; P = .08) and other major adverse outcome events, including renal, cardiac, neurologic, and pulmonary complications. The aprotinin group had a shorter mechanical ventilation time (P = .04), a lower rate of delayed mechanical ventilation time (P = .04), and a higher arterial oxygen tension/inspired oxygen fraction ratio in arterial blood gas analysis (P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis confirmed findings from univariate analysis. After propensity adjustment for the baseline characteristics, we obtained similar results. Conclusions: Use of aprotinin in cardiac surgery could reduce blood loss and transfusion requirement significantly and showed a protective effect on the lungs, but it did not increase the risk of mortality or major complications. © 2009 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

70350558900	Repair of left ventricular aneurysm: Ten-year experience in Chinese patients	Background: A large transmural myocardial infarction often results in a dyskinetic or akinetic left ventricular aneurysm (LVA). This study aimed to explore the early and long-term clinical outcomes and to identify predictors for survivals and hospital re-admission after the repair of left ventricular aneurysm. Methods: We followed up 497 patients who had undergone LVA repair from a single center in China between 1995 and 2005. The perioperative parameters were recorded. Risk factors for early mortality and long-term results were analyzed by multivariate Logistic regression. Cox's proportional hazard model was used to calculate risk factors for major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, cause of death and re-admission. Kaplan-Meier curve was employed to analyze long-term survival. Results: The operative mortality was 2.0%. The long-term mortality was 11.1% and cardiac causes contributed to 61.8% of the overall long-term mortality. Four hundred and thirty-two patients survived during the follow-up period and 37.5% of them had been re-admitted at least one time. One hundred and five patients experienced major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Survival analysis exhibited that the probability of survival at 1 and 5 years after operation was 96% and 86% respectively. Previous atrial fibrillation was the independent risk factor for early mortality. Independent risk factors for long-term mortality were poor left ventricular ejection fraction and stroke, and risk factors for cardiac mortality were intraventricular block, stroke and poor left ventricular ejection fraction. Stroke, intraventricular block and advanced age were independent risk factors for major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV was the only risk factor for hospital re-admission. Conclusions: Postinfarction LVA can be repaired and satisfying early and long-term clinical outcome can be obtained. Endoventricular circular plasty technique is the better choice than linear repair in patients with large LVA. Survival is affected in patients with poor heart function, intraventricular block and stroke.

0035290074	"Hybrid" revascularization: Video-thoracoscopy assisted MIDCAB combined with angioplasty	A "hybrid" revascularization technique has been developed for cases in which a chronic total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) cannot be recanalized by percutaneous coronary intervention, but the lesions in the right coronary artery and/or left circumflex artery are very good candidates for angioplasty. This technique, which uses video-thoracoscopy assisted minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass to recanalize the occluded LAD and angioplasty to dilate favorable lesions in other vessels, would achieve complete revascularization in selected patients with multi-vessel disease. In this preliminary study of four patients, angioplasty and stenting were successful in all patients without any complications; complete revascularization was achieved in all 4 patients. No recurrence of angina and no cardiovascular events developed during follow-up; this study therefore supports the belief that the "hybrid" revascularization technique is both feasible and safe.

77951279160	Evaluation of antiplatelet effects of a modified protocol by platelet aggregation in patients undergoing "one-stop" hybrid coronary revascularization	"One-stop" hybrid coronary revascularization has emerged to be a reliable and attractive alternative for selected patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. However, the optimal antiplatelet regimen of the one-stop hybrid procedure still remains controversial. We modified the antiplatelet protocol in order to reduce the risk of perioperative bleeding and maximally inhibit platelet activity. This study sought to investigate whether the inhibition of platelet activity by this modified antiplatelet protocol is comparable with the conventional protocol widely used and recommended in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Twenty three patients undergoing one-stop hybrid procedure and 20 patients undergoing conventional PCI were enrolled in this prospective study. The modified antiplatelet protocol included perioperative use of aspirin; clopidogrel was administered immediately before PCI with a 300 mg loading dose, followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg/day for 12 months. Blood samples were obtained before the operation and 2 hours, day 1 and day 3 after operation. Platelet aggregation was induced with: 1) arachidonic acid (AA) (final concentration 0.5 mmol/L) to assess the efficacy of aspirin; 2) adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (final concentration 10 mol/L) to assess the specific efficacy of clopidogrel. Platelet counts were statistically lower in the hybrid group than in the PCI control group (p=0.0018) on day 1 after operation. AA-induced platelet aggregation increased significantly in comparison with the preoperative baseline values (p=0.0079) and the PCI control group (p=0.0023) on day 1 after operation. ADP-induced platelet aggregation gradually decreased in the hybrid group, and achieved similar platelet inhibition with the PCI group on 2 hours and day 1 after operation. No major adverse clinical events such as death, perioperative myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis or reoperation for bleeding occurred in both groups within 30 days after procedure. These results demonstrate that our modified antiplatelet therapy can sufficiently inhibit platelet activity similarly as the conventional protocol for PCI early after operation. Thus, this modified protocol, with continuous use of aspirin and intraoperative administration of loading dose clopidogrel, might be a safe and effective antiplatelet strategy for the one-stop hybrid coronary revascularization. © 2010 Informa Healthcare Ltd.

77951766858	Increasing long-term major vascular events and resource consumption in patients receiving off-pump coronary artery bypass: A single-center prospective observational study	Background-: Despite its widespread use and short-term efficacy, substantial uncertainty remains about the long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB). Methods and results-: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was conducted of 6665 consecutive patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) at our institution during 1999 to 2006. All patients were followed up until September 30, 2008. Short-and long-term outcomes were compared between OPCAB and conventional CABG. The 2 main long-term outcome measures were repeat revascularization and the composite outcome of major vascular events. Cost comparison at 2 years in a propensity-matched sample during follow-up was also a study interest. The overall mean baseline age was 60.3±8.6 years, and 17.0% were women. Compared with conventional CABG, patients who underwent OPCAB had lower rates of atrial fibrillation (P=0.003) and requirements for blood transfusion (P=0.03) and ventilation time >24 hours (P<0.001). After an average of 4.5 years of follow-up, the rates of repeat revascularization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.89) and major vascular events (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.39) were significantly higher in the OPCAB than the conventional CABG group. At 2 years, OPCAB was associated with increased additional direct costs per patient compared with conventional CABG and had a similar survival rate. Conclusions-: Compared with conventional CABG, OPCAB is associated with small short-term gain but increased long-term risks of repeat revascularization and major vascular events, especially among high-risk patients. Moreover, OPCAB consumes more resources and is less cost-effective in the long run. Copyright © 2010 American Heart Association. All rights reserved.

77953067298	Effects of Aprotinin on Short-Term and Long-Term Outcomes After Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery	Background: Recent studies demonstrated that aprotinin use would increase the short-term and long-term mortality and complications after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This study was to investigate effects of aprotinin during isolated primary CABG on short-term and long-term outcomes in Chinese patients. Methods: We studied 5,103 consecutive Chinese patients who underwent isolated primary CABG from 1999 to 2005. Of all the patients, 4,122 received aprotinin during operation (aprotinin group) and 981 received no aprotinin or other antifibrinolytic therapy (control group). Short-term and long-term mortality and major complications were analyzed with multivariate regression analysis. Propensity adjustment method was used to minimize the selection bias between the two groups, and propensity matching method was used to yield two well-matched groups for further comparison. Results: Blood loss after operation was significantly reduced in the aprotinin group compared with the control group (p < 0.001). Aprotinin use was neither associated with the perioperative mortality (p = 0.45, relative risk, 1.34) or major complications, nor was it associated with long-term mortality (p = 0.21, relative risk, 1.26) and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (p = 0.82, relative risk, 0.98). After propensity adjustment for the baseline characteristics, we obtained similar results. In addition, comparison between the two well-matched groups showed no significant difference either in baseline characteristics or in short-term and long-term outcomes. Conclusions: Aprotinin use during isolated primary CABG reduced blood loss significantly, but was not associated with short-term or long-term mortality and complications. Aprotinin use in relatively low-risk CABG patients was effective and safe in a Chinese (Asian) population. © 2010 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

77956612249	Signal pathways involved in reverse remodeling of the hypertrophic rat heart after pressure unloading	Background: The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of molecular changes associated with the beneficial reverse remodeling through heterotopic transplantation model of rat hypertrophic hearts. Methods: Stable cardiac hypertrophy was induced by abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) in Lewis rats (6 weeks). Left ventricular (LV) pressure unloading was induced by heterotopic transplantation of hypertrophic hearts (AAC-HT) (2 weeks). We measured heart weight (HW), LV weight (LVW) and the LV-to-final body weight ratio (LVW/BW). Cross-sectional areas of cardiomyocyte and collagen content were assessed by hematoxylin/eosin staining and picrosirius red staining, respectively. We further analyzed the signaling pathways of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), Akt/GSK3β, NF-κB, metalloproteinase-2,9 (MMP-2, 9) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) by Western blot. Results: The HW, LVW and LVW/BW in AAC hearts were higher than normal hearts, but the transplanted hearts showed a significant reduction in HW, LVW and LVW/BW compared to AAC hearts. Unloading induced a decrease in cardiomyocyte size and an increase in collagen content in AAC-HT hearts. A significant decrease in phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinases (ERK), Akt, GSK3β and NF-κB was detected in AAC-HT hearts, but the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) was not changed. MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 activity also increased accompanied by unloading. Conclusions: Pressure unloading of the hypertrophic heart caused a reverse remodeling through regulating the ERK, Akt/GSK3β, and NFκB signal pathways, revealing these as potential target pathways for reversal of LV hypertrophy. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

78449256123	Apical conicity ratio: A new index on left ventricular apical geometry after myocardial infarction	Objective: Our objective was to introduce a new index to evaluate left ventricular aneurysm by quantitative analysis of left ventricular apical geometry. Methods: A total of 116 selected subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging, 28 healthy volunteers, 29 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and 59 patients with ischemic heart disease (26 with left ventricular aneurysm; 33 with no aneurysm). The apical conicity ratio was calculated as the ratio of left ventricular apical area over apical triangle. Results: Diastolic apical conicity ratio of patients with left ventricular aneurysm was 1.62 ± 0.20 and systolic apical conicity ratio was 1.78 ± 0.43. After left ventricular reconstruction, the diastolic apical conicity ratio decreased to 1.47 ± 0.23 and the systolic ratio to 1.51 ± 0.21, which came close to the normal level, whereas other global indices remained. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, sphericity index and eccentricity index increased significantly without changes in the apical conicity ratio. Among patients with ischemic heart disease, the apical conicity ratio of the group with left ventricular aneurysm was significantly higher than that of the group without an aneurysm when the other indices between the 2 groups showed no statistically difference. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed only apical conicity ratio had high power of discriminating left ventricular aneurysm from no aneurysm. Conclusions: The new index, apical conicity ratio, can be used to quantify the regional left ventricular deformation, especially in patients with left ventricular aneurysm resulting from myocardial infarction. © 2010 by The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

78449258655	A novel vascularized patch enhances cell survival and modifies ventricular remodeling in a rat myocardial infarction model	Objective: Although stem cells hold a great therapeutic potential for injured tissues, limited survival of transplanted stem cells has hindered the clinical application of this technology. We hypothesized that an omentum-based stem cell-supporting patch could provide adequate nutrients and microenvironment to prolong cell survival. We examined this hypothesis in rats with experimental myocardial infarction. Methods: The omentum-based supporting patch was constructed by stitching polylactic acid-co-glycolic acid polymer seeded with mesenchymal stem cells from male Sprague-Dawley rats. Eight weeks after the experimental myocardial infarction, which was created by ligating the left coronary artery of female Sprague-Dawley rats, mesenchymal stem cells were transplanted with (n = 16) or without (n = 14) the supporting patch. After 4 weeks, transplanted mesenchymal stem cell survival, ventricular remodeling, and cardiac performance were examined. Results: Significantly more cells survived after 4 weeks in rats transplanted with mesenchymal stem cells on the supporting patch assessed by means of polymerase chain reaction detection of the Sry gene than seen in those without the supporting patch (2.61 ± 0.40 vs 1.19 ± 0.12, P < .05). Rats with myocardial infarction that received mesenchymal stem cells with the patch also had significantly improved ventricular remodeling and cardiac function than those without the patch. Wrapping infarcted myocardium with omentum alone did not change the myocardial function. Conclusions: The omentum-based cell-supporting patch provided a favorable microenvironment for transplanted mesenchymal stem cell survival, which resulted in favorable ventricular remodeling and restoration of cardiac function in rats with experimental myocardial infarction. Further validation of the technique in human subjects could make mesenchymal stem cell transplantation a viable therapeutic option for patients with cardiac disease. © 2010 by The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

78649877777	Left ventricular reconstruction with no-patch technique: Early and late clinical outcomes	Background Few studies have evaluated late clinical outcome of no-patch technique in patients with large left ventricular aneurysms. The objectives of this study were to evaluate a no-patch surgical technique to reconstruct the left ventricle in patients with left ventricular aneurysm and to assess early and late clinical outcomes. Methods In 1995, we began using a no-patch technique in patients with dyskinetic left ventricular aneurysms. A total of 145 patients underwent left ventricular reconstruction with this technique and were followed up for (59±29) months (range, 1-127 months). Risk factors for early mortality were analyzed by bivariate analyses. Cox's proportional hazards model was used to calculate risk factors for all-cause mortality and hospital readmission. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to analyze late survival. Results One week after operation, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter had decreased from (61±8) mm to (55±8) mm, and geometry of the left ventricle was restored to a more normal conical shape. Early mortality was 3% and late mortality 11%. Over a 5-year follow-up period, hospital readmission was 28%. One-, 5-, and 10-year survival estimates were 95% (95% confidence interval (CI) 91%-99%), 86% (95% CI 78%-94%), and 74% (95% CI 60%-88%). Readmission-free survival at 1 and 5 years after operation was 87% (95% CI 81%-93%) and 60% (95% CI 50%-70%), respectively. Conclusion The no-patch technique for left ventricular reconstruction is an effective and simple procedure that can achieve satisfactory early and late clinical outcomes in patients with left ventricular aneurysms.

78650488153	Do patients with complete transposition of the great arteries and severe pulmonary hypertension benefit from an arterial switch operation?	Background Whether an arterial switch operation benefits patients with transposition of the great arteries and severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) remains controversial. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between preoperative PH and early and midterm clinical outcomes after an arterial switch procedure. Methods In this retrospective study, 101 consecutive patients with transposition of the great arteries underwent an arterial switch operation between February 2004 and October 2007. Seventy had a ventricular septal defect as well; patients with intact ventricular septum and complicated concomitant abnormities were excluded. Preoperative medical records were reviewed and mean follow-up was 22.4 ± 15.2 months. After sternotomy, we directly measured pulmonary artery pressure before and after instituting extracorporeal circulation. Patients were divided into three groups according to mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP): control group (mPAP < 25 mm Hg, n = 23), moderate PH group (mPAP 25 to 50 mm Hg, n = 37), and severe PH group (mPAP < 50 mm Hg, n = 10). Early and midterm results were compared among groups. Results Postoperatively, pulmonary artery pressure of both the moderate and severe PH groups decreased significantly. There were no significant differences in occurrence of postoperative complications or in-hospital mortality in the three groups (control group, 8.7%; moderate PH group, 8.1%; severe PH group, 10%; p = 0.98). However, midterm mortality differed significantly (control group, 4.3%; moderate PH group, 2.7%; severe PH group, 40%; p < 0.01). Conclusions Patients with transposition of the great arteries and mPAP less than 50 mm Hg can achieve satisfying results after an arterial switch operation. However, even though the operation can decrease pulmonary artery pressure, patients with preoperative mPAP greater than 50 mm Hg still suffer from high midterm mortality. © 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

79551499868	Predictors for late insufficiency of the neo-aortic valve after the switch procedure	Background and aim of the study: The study aim was to investigate the mid-term risk factors for neo-aortic regurgitation in patients with transposition of the great arteries (TGA) and Taussig-Bing malformation after the arterial switch operation (ASO). Methods: Between February 2001 and December 2007, a total of 202 patients with TGA or Taussig-Bing malformation underwent the ASO at the authors' institution. Subsequently, 185 surviving patients (140 males, 45 females; mean age 14 ± 28 months) were followed up in the out-patient department, using echocardiography. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for postoperative neo-aortic regurgitation. Results: The mean period of follow up was 35 ± 22 months (range: 3 to 88 months). Postoperative neoaortic regurgitation was present in 19 patients; this was mild in 16 cases (9%) and moderate in three (2%). During the follow up, freedom from aortic regurgitation was 90%; the overall rates of freedom from aortic regurgitation at one, three, and five years were 95%, 89%, and 83%, respectively. The mid-term risk factors for neo-aortic regurgitation were ventricular septal defect (VSD) (p = 0.02), operative age >6 months (p = 0.01), and a postoperative neo-aortic valve Z-score >1 (p <0.01). Conclusion: The ASO showed an acceptable midterm function of the aortic valve. The risk factors for postoperative neo-aortic regurgitation included VSD, operative age >6 months, and a postoperative neo-aortic valve Z-score >1. © Copyright by ICR Publishers 2010.

78751673560	Simultaneous hybrid revascularization versus off-pump coronary artery bypass for multivessel coronary artery disease	Background This study sought to compare early and midterm clinical outcomes of a simultaneous hybrid coronary revascularization procedure with those in a propensity-matched subset of patients undergoing conventional off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Methods From June 2007 through December 2009, 104 consecutive patients (mean age 61.8 ± 10.2 years) with multivessel coronary artery disease underwent elective simultaneous coronary revascularization at Fuwai Hospital. Using propensity score methodology, these patients were matched with 104 patients who had undergone off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting through median sternotomy during the same period. We compared these groups' in-hospital clinical outcomes and freedom from major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events at a mean follow-up of 18 ± 7.9 months. Results The hybrid procedure required longer operative time and incurred higher in-hospital costs, but had shorter median intubation time (11.6 ± 6.3 vs 13.8 ± 6.8 hours, p = 0.02), intensive care unit length of stay (34.5 ± 35.6 vs 55.3 ± 46.4 hours, p < 0.001), and postoperative in-hospital length of stay (8.2 ± 2.6 vs 9.5 ± 4.5 days, p = 0.01). The hybrid group had significantly less chest tube drainage (789 ± 389 vs 834 ± 285 mL, p = 0.005) and need for blood transfusion (28.8% vs 51.9%, p > 0.001). At a mean follow-up of 18 months, the freedom from major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events is in favor of the hybrid group (99.0% vs 90.4%; p = 0.03). Conclusions Compared with conventional off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, simultaneous hybrid coronary revascularization shortens recovery time and has superior outcomes at a mean follow-up of 18 months. Simultaneous hybrid coronary revascularization provides a safe and reproducible alternative for selected patients with multivessel coronary artery diseases. © 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

78751694614	Aspirin plus clopidogrel therapy increases early venous graft patency after coronary artery bypass surgery: A single-center, randomized, controlled trial	Objectives: We sought to evaluate the effect of aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin alone on saphenous vein graft occlusion at 3 months after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Background: Prevalence of graft occlusion is high after CABG. Aggressive antiplatelet therapy is expected to improve early post-operative graft patency. Methods: From December 2007 through December 2008, 249 consecutive patients undergoing elective CABG at Fuwai Hospital were randomly assigned to 2 groups: 124 received aspirin (100 mg) plus clopidogrel (75 mg) daily (AC group), and 125 received aspirin (100 mg) alone daily (A group). Antiplatelet therapies were initiated when postoperative chest tube drainage was ≤30 cc/h for 2 h. All participants were invited for clinical follow-up and 64- slice multislice computed tomography angiography (MSCTA) analysis at 3 months post-operatively. Generalized estimating equations analysis was used to determine predictors of graft patency. Results: One participant, from group A, died before 3-month follow-up. Of the remaining 248 patients, 224 (90.3%) underwent MSCTA. Participants had similar pre-operative and intraoperative characteristics at baseline. No significant differences were observed in intraoperative transit-time flow measurement findings or major adverse cardiac-related events. Three-month MSCTA follow-up revealed that saphenous vein graft patency was 91.6% (219 of 239) in the AC group versus 85.7% (198 of 231) in the A group (p = 0.043). In multivariate analysis, combined antiplatelet therapy independently increased venous graft patency (p = 0.045). Conclusions: Aspirin plus clopidogrel is more effective in venous graft patency than aspirin alone in the short term after CABG, but further, long-term study is needed.

79952782136	Taurine restores Axl/Gas6 expression in vascular smooth muscle cell calcification model	Our previous studies demonstrated that taurine inhibits osteoblastic differentiation of vascular smooth muscular cells (VSMCs) via the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway, but the underlying mechanism is not elucidated. The tyrosine kinase receptor Axl and its ligand growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) are expressed in VSMCs. Axl/Gas6 signaling system is known to inhibit VSMCs calcification. We herein showed that taurine partially restored Axl and Gas6 expression in β-glycerophosphate (β-GP)-induced VSMC calcification model. Taurine also induced activation of ERK, but not other two MAPKs including c-jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and p38 in VSMCs. Either knockdown of the taurine transporter (TAUT) or treatment with the ERK-specific inhibitor PD98059 blocked the activation of ERK by taurine and abolished taurine-induced Axl/Gas6 expression and calcium deposition reduction in β-GP-induced VSMC calcification model. These results demonstrate for the first time that taurine stimulates expression of Axl and Gas6 via TAUT/ERK signaling pathway in β-GP-induced VSMC calcification model. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

79955662598	Type-specific dysregulation of matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors in end-stage heart failure patients: Relationship between MMP-10 and LV remodelling	Although past studies observed the changes of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in end-stage heart failure (HF) patients, a consistent and clear pattern of type-specific MMPs and/or TIMPs has yet to be further defined. In this study, proteomic approach of human protein antibody arrays was used to compare MMP and TIMP expression levels of left ventricular (LV) myocardial samples from end-stage HF patients due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with those from age- and sex- matched non-failing patients. Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and ELISA were used for validation of our results. We observed that MMP-10 and -7 abundance increased, accompanied by decreased TIMP-4 in DCM failing hearts (n= 8) compared with non-failing hearts (n= 8). The results were further validated in a cohort of 34 end-stage HF patients derived from three forms of cardiomyopathies. Cardiac and plasma MMP-10 levels were positively correlated with the LV end-diastolic dimension in this HF cohort. In addition, we observed that insulin-like growth factor-2 promoted MMP-10 production in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a selective up-regulation of MMP-10 and -7 along with a discordant change of TIMP-4, and a positive correlation between MMP-10 levels and the degree of LV dilation in end-stage HF patients.

79958279624	Isolated coronary artery bypass graft combined with bone marrow mononuclear cells delivered through a graft vessel for patients with previous myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure: A single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial	Objectives: This study aimed at examining the efficacy of bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMNC) delivery through graft vessel for patients with a previous myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic heart failure during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Background: Little evidence exists supporting the practice of BMMNC delivery through graft vessel for patients with a previous MI and chronic heart failure during CABG. Methods: From November 2006 to June 2009, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to test the efficacy and safety of CABG for multivessel coronary artery disease combined with autologous BMMNCs in patients with congestive heart failure due to severe ischemic cardiomyopathy. Sixty-five patients were recruited, and 60 patients remained in the final trial and were randomized to a CABG + BMMNC group (n = 31) and a placebo-control group (i.e., CABG-only group, n = 29). All patients discharged received a 6-month follow-up. Changes in left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to 6-month follow-up, as examined by magnetic resonance imaging, were of primary interest. Results: The overall baseline age was 59.5 ± 9.2 years, and 6.7% were women. After a 6-month follow-up, compared with the placebo-control group, the CABG + BMMNC group had significant changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.029), left ventricular end-systolic volume index (p = 0.017), and wall motion index score (p = 0.011). Also, the changes in the distance on the 6-min walking test as well as B-type natriuretic peptide were significantly greater in the CABG + BMMNC group than in the control group. Conclusions: In summary, patients with a previous MI and chronic heart failure could potentially benefit from isolated CABG (i.e., those who received CABG only) combined with BMMNCs delivered through a graft vessel.

80053314347	Vascularized atrial tissue patch cardiomyoplasty with omentopexy improves cardiac performance after myocardial infarction	Background: The tissue-engineered cardiac patch can alleviate ventricular remodeling and improve functional recovery in experimental myocardial infarction. However, the size of the engineered patch is limited due to insufficient vascularization. This study evaluated the effects of autologous atrial tissue patch cardiomyoplasty and omentopexy in rats with myocardial infarction. Methods: Myocardial infarction was induced by left coronary artery ligation in Sprague-Dawley rats. Three weeks later, either a patch of left atrium (A group) or omentum (O group) or both (OA group) were placed over the infarct zone. The atrial tissue patch was harvested from the autologous left atrial appendage along its long axis. The rats in the Control group received rethoracotomy only. After 4 weeks, the survival of the transplanted atrial tissue patch, ventricular remodeling, and cardiac performance were examined. Results: After 4 weeks, surviving myocardium was only detected in the OA group, as indicated by immunolabeling of cardiac troponin-I. Compared with the Control group, only animals in the OA group showed improved heart function assessed by left ventricular ejection fraction (57.9% ± 5.8% vs 47.5% ± 4.5%, p < 0.05) and left ventricular fractional shortening (25.2% ± 3.6% vs 20.7% ± 2.0%, p < 0.05). The histologic analysis demonstrated increased scar thickness in the OA group. This was accompanied by increased angiogenesis of the border zone but decreased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase and endothelin-1 levels. Conclusions: The omentopexy supported the survival of the autologous atrial tissue patch, which resulted in attenuated ventricular remodeling and restoration of heart function in rats with myocardial infarction. Our findings might represent a novel therapeutic strategy for heart failure. © 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

81855185031	Mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension related to ventricular septal defect in congenital heart disease	Background: The aim of this study was to investigate differences in molecular mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension between patients with complete transposition of the great arteries (TGA) combined with ventricular septal defect (VSD) and those with VSD alone. Methods: Twenty-four consecutive patients with pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure > 30 mm Hg) underwent surgical correction of TGA + VSD (n = 10) or VSD alone (n = 14). Lung specimens were taken from the right middle lobe before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Extent of pulmonary hypertension was graded according to the Heath-Edwards pathologic classification. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), endothelin-1 (ET-1), endothelin A and B receptors (ET-AR, ET-BR), matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2, MMP-9), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP). Results: There were no statistically significant differences in age, height, weight, VSD diameter, or preoperative pulmonary artery pressure between groups. Hemoglobin level, pulmonary artery oxygen saturation, and reduction in postoperative pulmonary artery pressure were significantly higher in patients undergoing correction of TGA + VSD (p < 0.05). All patients had grade 0 to II Heath-Edwards morphologic changes in lung biopsy samples. Expression of eNOS and MMP-2 was significantly lower in the TGA + VSD group than in the VSD-alone group (eNOS, 280.13 ± 101.92 ng/mg versus 488.41 ± 249.60 ng/mg; p < 0.05; MMP-2, 31.68 ± 15.36 ng/mg versus 69.28 ± 49.12 ng/mg; p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in expression of iNOS, ET-1, ET-AR, ET-BR, MMP-9, or TIMP. Conclusions: In patients with TGA + VSD, high oxygenation in the pulmonary circulation decreases expression of MMP-2 and eNOS, which may affect the progress and reversibility of pulmonary hypertension. © 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

84860843384	Coronary artery bypass graft contemporary heart surgery center performance in China	Background-The use of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in China is growing, but little is known about hospital-level performance. We sought to characterize the variation in performance across hospitals participating in a national registry in China. Methods and Results-The study sample was drawn from the Chinese Cardiac Surgery Registry, a national multicenter database that includes 43 hospitals across 13 provinces and 4 direct-controlled municipalities in China. We assessed consecutive patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery during the period of January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2008. Hierarchical generalized linear models were used to estimate hospital-level risk-standardized in-hospital all-cause mortality rates (RSMR) and major complication rates (RSMCR), which included death, myocardial infarction, reoperation for bleeding, mediastinal infection, stroke, reintubation, and renal failure. Among 8739 patients who underwent isolated CABG surgery, the mean age was 62.2 years (SD=9.2), and 78% were male. Observed in-hospital mortality and complication rates were 2.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-2.5%) and 6.6% (95% CI, 6.1-7.1%), respectively. The mean RSMR was 1.9% (SD=1.1), with a range of 0.7-5.8%, and the mean RSMCR was 6.4% (SD=1.5), with a range of 3.8 -10.1%. The odds of dying and the odds of having a complication after CABG surgery at a hospital 1 SD below the average relative to a hospital 1 SD above the average were 2.06 (95% CI, 1.40 -3.04) and 1.53 (95% CI, 1.31-1.79), respectively. The Eastern region had the lowest RSMR and RSMCR (1.6% and 5.8%, respectively), whereas the Central region had the highest RSMR (2.5%) and the Southern region had the highest RSMCR (7.7%). Conclusions-Mortality and complication rates after CABG surgery in the Chinese Cardiac Surgery Registry are generally low but vary by hospital and region within China. These results suggest that there are opportunities to improve outcomes in some CABG facilities. © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.

84862180384	Expression of MicroRNA-1 and MicroRNA-21 in different protocols of ischemic conditioning in an isolated rat heart model	Background: 'Conditioning' [ischemic preconditioning (IPC), ischemic postconditioning (IPO) and remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC)] the heart to render it more resistant to an episode of acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is an endogenous cardioprotective strategy. There are several mechanisms proposed for 'conditioning', such as endogenous mediators or cytoprotective proteins. In recent reports, microRNAs (miRNAs) were involved in controlling the expression of myocardial ischemia-related genes. Some studies have demonstrated that cardiac miRNA-1 and miRNA-21 were significantly increased by late IPC with an increase in their target proteins [endothelial nitric oxide synthase and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)], but their expression levels in 'conditioning' strategies are currently unknown. Methods: In the current study, Langendorff-perfused Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were randomly assigned to one of four groups [control group (CON group, n = 12), IPC group (n = 12), IPO group (n = 12) and RIPC group (n = 12)]. Cardiac function was digitalized and analyzed. The expression of miRNA-1 and miRNA-21 was detected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The expression of HSP70, programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) was detected by Western blot. Cardiac infarct size and myocardial apoptosis were determined using the 2,3,5- triphenyltetrazolium chloride assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, respectively. Results: The results revealed that miRNA-1 (233 ± 45%) and miRNA-21 (356 ± 33%) expression was up-regulated in the IPC group, but the expression of miRNA-1 was down-regulated in the RIPC (61 ± 16%) group and IPO group (61 ± 13%). The expression of PDCD4 [IPC (74 ± 11%), RIPC (81 ± 16%), IPO (83 ± 12%)], HSP70 [IPC (74 ± 5%), RIPC (81 ± 6%), IPO (67 ± 11%)] and Bax [IPC (27 ± 6%), RIPC (21 ± 3%), IPO (27 ± 4%)] was down-regulated in the conditioning groups compared with the CON group [PDCD4 (130 ± 11%), HSP70 (121 ± 11%) and Bax (63 ± 8%)]. In the conditioning hearts, infarct size [IPC (31.7 ± 4.1%), RIPC (29.6 ± 6.19%) and IPO (32.8 ± 4.71%)] and myocardial apoptosis [IPC (15.2 ± 4.21%), RIPC (17.2 ± 1.92%) and IPO (15.6 ± 4.04%)] were significantly decreased compared with the CON group (infarct size: 51.77 ± 4.3%, myocardial apoptosis: 32.8 ± 3.96%). Conclusion: We concluded that miRNA-1 and miRNA-21 expression differed in IPC, RIPC and IPO groups, and their target proteins were not inversely correlated with the miRNAs in all the conditioning groups, which revealed that the miRNAs were regulated but complicated by the different conditioning protocols. © 2012 S.

84863236138	Midterm outcomes of simultaneous hybrid coronary artery revascularization for left main coronary artery disease	Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and midterm outcomes of a simultaneous hybrid revascularization strategy for left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD), compared with conventional off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB). Methods: We compared the in-hospital and midterm outcomes of a simultaneous hybrid revascularization strategy (minimally invasive direct coronary bypass grafting of the left anterior descending coronary artery [LAD] and percutaneous intervention to non-LAD lesions) in 20 patients with LMCAD in an enhanced operating room. These patients were matched by propensity score to a group of 20 control patients who underwent standard OPCAB between September 2007 and December 2009. Results: All baseline clinical characteristics of the 2 groups were similar. All of the patients in the 2 groups underwent surgery uneventfully without conversion to on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Compared with OPCAB, the patients in the hybrid group had shorter lengths of stay in the intensive care unit (34.8 ± 37.6 hours versus 50.7 ± 34.5 hours, P = .01). Transfusion requirements were reduced in the hybrid patients compared with the OPCAB patients (5% versus 40%, P = .01). The 2 groups did not differ with respect to the occurrence of other important morbidities. During the mean (±SD) follow-up of 18.5 ± 9.8 months, the group of patients who underwent the simultaneous hybrid procedure experienced an incidence of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events that was similar to that of the OPCAB control group (100% versus 90%, respectively; P = .31). Conclusions: The midterm follow-up indicated that the simultaneous hybrid revascularization procedure for LMCAD is feasible, safe, and effective. These promising early findings warrant further prospective investigations.

84863981199	Preoperative high-sensitivity C-reactive protein predicts depression in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery: A single-center prospective observational study	Objective: Our objective was to reveal the contribution of preoperative high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels to the risk of depression in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods: In this study, 232 consecutive patients undergoing elective CABG were evaluated for depression utilizing the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire scale at least 3 days before surgery and 6 months after CABG. In addition, peripheral blood samples were collected at baseline and the circulation levels of hsCRP were measured. Results: The preoperative and postoperative rate of depression was 18.1%. Interestingly, preoperative depression was independently associated with women (odds ratio [OR], 2.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-5.50) and log-transformed hsCRP (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06-1.27) after adjusting for various factors using logistic regression, including age, sex, and university-level education. Postoperative depression was only associated with log-transformed hsCRP (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05-1.25) in these patients. Log-transformed hsCRP remained associated with future depression after adjusting for postoperative medications or major adverse cardiovascular events during the follow-up period. Conclusions: The present study is the first to report elevated serum hsCRP is an independent predictor for depression in CABG patients not only preoperatively but also up to 6 months after surgery. These clinical findings may reveal a potential target for improving prognosis in CABG patients with depression. © 2012 by The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

84863982405	Risk factors and in-hospital mortality in Chinese patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting: Analysis of a large multi-institutional Chinese database	Objective: This study was undertaken to delineate outcomes and to assess risk factors for in-hospital mortality among Chinese patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Methods: From 2007 to 2008, a total of 9838 consecutive adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were enrolled in the Chinese Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Registry, which included 43 centers from 17 province-level regions in China. This registry collected information on 67 preoperative factors and 30 operative factors believed to influence in-hospital mortality. The relationship between risk factors and in-hospital mortality was evaluated by univariate and logistic regression analyses. Results: Overall in-hospital mortality was 2.5%. Eleven risk factors were found to be significant predictors for outcome: age (continuous), body mass index (continuous), left ventricular ejection fraction (continuous), preoperative New York Heart Association functional class III or IV, chronic renal failure, extracardiac arteriopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, preoperative atrial fibrillation or flutter (within 2 weeks), preoperative critical state, other than elective surgery, and combined valve procedure. Calibration with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was satisfactory (P = .35), and the discrimination power was good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.79-0.84). Conclusions: The risk profiles and in-hospital mortality of Chinese patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were determined from data in the most up-to-date multi-institutional database. Eleven variables were demonstrated to be independent risk factors for in-hospital death after coronary artery bypass grafting. © 2012 by The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

84865439215	MicroRNA-24 regulates cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction	Cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction (MI) has been identified as a key factor in the development of heart failure. Although dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) is involved in various pathophysiological processes in the heart, the role of miRNA in fibrosis regulation after MI is not clear. Previously we observed the correlation between fibrosis and the miR-24 expression in hypertrophic hearts, herein we assessed how miR-24 regulates fibrosis after MI. Using qRT-PCR, we showed that miR-24 was down-regulated in the MI heart; the change in miR-24 expression was closely related to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. In vivo, miR-24 could improve heart function and attenuate fibrosis in the infarct border zone of the heart two weeks after MI through intramyocardial injection of Lentiviruses. Moreover, in vitro experiments suggested that up-regulation of miR-24 by synthetic miR-24 precursors could reduce fibrosis and also decrease the differentiation and migration of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). TGF-β (a pathological mediator of fibrotic disease) increased miR-24 expression, overexpression of miR-24 reduced TGF-β secretion and Smad2/3 phosphorylation in CFs. By performing microarray analyses and bioinformatics analyses, we found furin to be a potential target for miR-24 in fibrosis (furin is a protease which controls latent TGF-β activation processing). Finally, we demonstrated that protein and mRNA levels of furin were regulated by miR-24 in CFs. These findings suggest that miR-24 has a critical role in CF function and cardiac fibrosis after MI through a furin-TGF-β pathway. Thus, miR-24 may be used as a target for treatment of MI and other fibrotic heart diseases. © 2012 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine © 2012 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84867203519	Comparison of the Effects of Three Cell Saver Devices on Erythrocyte Function During Cardiopulmonary Bypass Procedure-A Pilot Study	Cell salvage devices are routinely used to process red blood cells (RBCs) shed during cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate three commercially available cell saver (CS) devices in terms of erythrocyte function and the quality of washed RBCs during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Thirty patients undergoing CPB were randomly allocated to three CS devices: Group C (Cell Saver 5+; Haemonetics, n=10), Group M (autolog; Medtronic, n=10), and Group F (CATS; Fresenius HemoCare, n=10). Blood samples were collected from reservoirs and transfusion bags. Reservoirs and washed RBCs were analyzed for erythrocyte aggregation index, deformation index (DI) and hematocrit viscosity, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), free Hb removal (ΔfHb), glucose (Glu), lactate (Lac), and blood urea nitrogen. After processing, Groups C (P=0.026) and M (P=0.032) had relatively higher erythrocyte DI compared with Group F. Group C had lower Δ2,3-DPG compared with Groups M (P=0.001) and F (P=0.001). Group F provided the maximum concentration of Hct (P=0.021; 0.046) and Hb (P=0.008; 0.013). In addition, Groups C (P=0.035) and M (P=0.038) had a higher removal of fHb (ΔfHb), differing significantly with Group F. In conclusion, CS devices use the same theory of centrifugation; however, based on different designs, the function of the washed erythrocyte and undesirable content removal efficiency differs widely from one device to another. © 2012, Copyright the Authors.

84867902943	Is the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation useful in Chinese patients undergoing heart valve surgery?	Background The European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) is one of the most widely used risk models for the predicting mortality after cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to validate the EuroSCORE model for predicting operative mortality in heart valve surgery on a Chinese multicenter database and comparing the performance of EuroSCORE with our new risk stratification system, the Sino System for Coronary Operative Risk Evaluation (SinoSCORE). Methods Data from patients undergoing heart valve surgery between January 2007 and December 2008 were retrospectively collected, from 43 hospitals in China. The EuroSCORE and the SinoSCORE were calculated for each patient. Mortality was defined as any in-hospital death. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was used to study the discriminatory abilities of the models. The Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) goodness-of-fit test was used to study the calibration of the predictive models. Results A total of 15 367 patients were analyzed. For the entire cohort, the observed mortality was 2.34%, the predicted mortality was 3.71% (additive), 3.19% (logistic) and 3.66% (SinoSCORE). AUC was 0.747 for SinoSCORE, 0.699 additive and 0.696 for logistic EuroSCORE. Calibration of SinoSCORE and additive EuroSCORE was good (H-L: P=0.250 and P=0.051, respectively), but the logistic EuroSCORE model had a poor calibration (H-L: P<0.05). The discriminatory ability and calibration of the SinoSCORE were good in low-and high-risk patients. However, the discriminatory ability of the EuroSCORE model was poor in all risk deciles. Conclusions The EuroSCORE does not accurately predict mortality in Chinese patients with heart valve surgery, and the SinoSCORE is superior to the EuroSCORE at predicting in-hospital mortality in Chinese heart valve surgery patients.

84873463976	Major risk-stratification models fail to predict outcomes in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease undergoing simultaneous hybrid procedure	Background The hybrid procedure for coronary heart disease combines minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is an alternative to revascularization treatment. We sought to assess the predictive value of four risk-stratification models for risk assessment of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in patients with multivessel disease undergoing hybrid coronary revascularization. Methods The data of 120 patients were retrospectively collected and the SYNTAX score, EuroSCORE, SinoSCORE and the Global Risk Classification (GRC) calculated for each patient. The outcomes of interest were 2.7-year incidences of MACCE, including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and any-vessel revascularization. Results During a mean of 2.7-year follow-up, actuarial survival was 99.17%, and no myocardial infarctions occurred. The discriminatory power (area under curve (AUC)) of the SYNTAX score, EuroSCORE, SinoSCORE and GRC for 2.7-year MACCE was 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.42-0.77), 0.65 (0.47-0.82), 0.57 (0.39-0.75) and 0.65 (0.46-0.83), respectively. The calibration characteristics of the SYNTAX score, EuroSCORE, SinoSCORE and GRC were 3.92 (P=0.86), 5.39 (P=0.37), 13.81 (P=0.32) and 0.02 (P=0.89), respectively. Conclusions In patients with multivessel disease undergoing a hybrid procedure, the SYNTAX score, EuroSCORE, SinoSCORE and GRC were inaccurate in predicting MACCE. Modifying risk-stratification models to improve the predictive value for a hybrid procedure is needed.

84878130042	MicroRNA-21 and Risk of Severe Acute Kidney Injury and Poor Outcomes after Adult Cardiac Surgery	Background:Severe acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery is associated with poor clinical outcomes. This study evaluated the potential use of miR-21 as a risk marker for postoperative AKI progression and other poor outcomes.Methodology/Principal Findings:The study included 120 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery: 40 non-AKI controls, 39 patients with progressive AKI, and 41 with non-progressive AKI. Urine and plasma levels of miR-21 were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Associations between miR-21 levels and AKI progression were determined by estimating areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). We demonstrated that up-regulated urine and plasma levels of miR-21 in patients with AKI were both associated with AKI progression. The AUCs for urine and plasma levels of miR-21 associated with established AKI were 0.68 (95%CI: 0.59-0.78) and 0.80 (95%CI: 0.73-0.88), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusting for clinical variables, indicated that the prognostic predictive power of urine and plasma miR-21 levels for AKI progression were represented by AUCs of 0.81 (95%CI: 0.72-0.91) and 0.83 (95%CI: 0.74-0.92), respectively. Urinary and plasma miR-21 levels also predicted the need for postoperative renal replacement therapy (RRT), development of Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) stage 3 AKI, 30-day in-hospital mortality and prolonged stay in hospital or ICU. Urine miR-21 was a better outcome predictor than plasma miR-21, being associated with higher (1.4- to 2.6-fold) unadjusted odds ratio for progression of AKI and other poor outcomes.Conclusions:Urinary and plasma miR-21 are associated with severe AKI and other poor postoperative outcomes of cardiac surgery, indicating their potential use as prognostic markers. © 2013 Du et al.

84879210899	One-stop hybrid coronary revascularization versus coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention for the treatment of multivessel coronary artery disease: 3-Year follow-up results from a single institution	Objectives This study sought to compare midterm clinical outcomes of 1-stop hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the treatment of multivessel coronary artery disease. Background One-stop HCR has emerged to be a feasible and attractive alternative to CABG and PCI in selected patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. Methods From June 2007 to December 2010, 141 consecutive patients underwent 1-stop HCR at Fuwai Hospital. Using propensity score methodology, these patients were matched with 2 separate groups of 141 patients who underwent isolated CABG or PCI during the same period. All patients were stratified by the EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation Score) and the SYNTAX (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) score. Cutoffs for EuroSCORE (low, ≤2; medium, >2 and <6; high, ≥6) and SYNTAX score (low, ≤24; medium, >24 and <30; high, ≥30) were identified by tertiles. Three groups' cumulative major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (MACCE) rates in each risk tertile were compared. Results One-stop HCR incurred MACCE rate lower than that with PCI (p < 0.001), but similar to that with CABG (p = 0.140). After stratification by EuroSCORE or SYNTAX score, the cumulative MACCE rates were similar among the 3 groups in low and medium tertiles. But in the high EuroSCORE tertile, patients who underwent 1-stop HCR had a lower MACCE rate than did the groups that underwent CABG (p = 0.030) and PCI (p = 0.006). Meanwhile, patients with a high SYNTAX score who underwent 1-stop HCR had a MACCE rate lower than did those who underwent PCI (p = 0.002), but similar to that of those who underwent CABG (p = 0.362). Conclusions One-stop HCR provides favorable midterm outcomes for selected patients with multivessel coronary artery disease in each risk tertile. For patients with high EuroSCORE or SYNTAX score, it might provide a promising alternative to CABG and PCI.© 2013 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation Published by Elsevier Inc.

84884486669	Assessment of coronary artery stenosis by coronary angiography: A head-to-head comparison with pathological coronary artery anatomy	Background-Conventional coronary angiography (CCA) has been considered as a gold standard for the diagnosis of coronary artery diseases; however, its diagnostic accuracy is still unknown. Methods and Results-Between July 2004 and December 2011, 97 patients underwent CCA within 15 days before heart transplantation in Fuwai hospital. A head-to-head comparison study was performed to examine the diagnostic accuracy of CCA as compared with that of pathological coronary artery anatomy. As confirmed by pathological coronary artery anatomy, 44 (45.4%) patients had coronary artery diseases. The patient-based diagnostic accuracy evaluation showed that the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of CCA for detecting =50% stenosis was 0.91, with a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 93%, and high concordance (≥=0.83). A per-vessel analysis of 291 vessels yielded an AUC of 0.79, the agreement of 3 vessels >0.6 (Κ statistic). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.88 for proximal and middle segments, and was 0.62 for distal segments, ≥ was calculated to detect the distal segments with lower concordance than proximal and middle segments. The patient- and vessel-based evaluations showed similar diagnostic accuracy of CCA in detecting =75% stenosis. Per-segment evaluation found CCA was more accurate for detecting =50% and =75% stenosis in proximal and middle segments than in distal segments, and the diagnosis ability decreased in more severe stenosis segments and more complex lesions. Conclusions-The accuracy of CCA is quite high in detecting coronary artery stenosis in patients- and vesselsbased levels. However, the diagnosis ability decreased in more severe and complex lesions, especially for distal segments. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.

84885653092	A pilot trial of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell transplantation through grafting artery: A sub-study focused on segmental left ventricular function recovery and scar reduction	Background Our preliminary study suggested that patients with chronic myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure could potentially benefit from CABG combined with aBM-MNC by improving global left ventricular (LV) function. The purpose of this sub-study was to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of aBM-MNC transplantation during CABG in patients with chronic MI by intensively analyzing the global and segmental LV function, the scar, and the relationships between the function recovery and the scar transmural extent. Methods A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was performed in 50 patients with chronic MI. The patients were randomly allocated into CABG with stem cell transplantation (group A) and CABG only (group B) groups. CMR assessments of global and segmental left ventricular function and scar tissue were performed before surgery and repeated at 12 months after CABG and aBM-MNC transplantation. Results The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved by 13.5% and 8.0% in group A and B respectively (P = 0.04). Segmental analysis of regional LV function recovery indicated that more improvement in contractility was found in group A within the same degree of the infarct transmurality (P = 0.017) and showed a predominant interaction in the most severely affected segments (76-100%, P = 0.016). Decrease in infarct size between the two groups did not reach statistical difference (9.4% vs. 6.0%, P = 0.100). Conclusions CMR assessments revealed reversed ventricular remodeling and improved systolic function and scar reduction in patients who underwent aBM-MNC transplantation during CABG. And the conjunctional use of CABG and stem cell therapy could improve the left ventricular function in patients with chronic MI. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

84885905981	Original rat model of high kinetic unilateral pulmonary hypertension surgically induced by combined surgery	Objectives: The characteristic morphologic lesions observed in the lungs of patients with congenital cardiac anomalies have not been closely modeled in rat shunt-related models, except for the reversible grade 1 changes. The present study reported an original rat model of unilateral pulmonary hypertension surgically induced by combined surgery to reproduce more advanced pulmonary vascular lesions. Methods: The right pulmonary artery was ligated through a right posterolateral thoracotomy, and a cervical shunt was established 1 week later. The immediate and chronic effects on the pulmonary hemodynamics were evaluated through right heart catheterization immediately after and at 8 and 12 weeks postoperatively. The morphologic changes in pulmonary vasculature were analyzed after staining with hematoxylin-eosin and modified Weigert's method. The right ventricular hypertrophy index was calculated and artery blood gas analysis performed. Results: A pulmonary hypertensive status was successfully induced immediately after cervical surgery and progressively aggravated into a borderline state with disease course advancing. Pulmonary vasculopathy demonstrated a transition from reversibility (muscularization, intimal proliferation of grade 1-2) at 8 weeks to irreversibility (intimal fibrosis, entirely luminal occlusion, grade 3) at 12 weeks postoperatively. Conspicuous right ventricular hypertrophy and decreasing partial arterial pressure of oxygen were also observed. Conclusions: The present shunt-related model successfully simulated a hypertensive status in pulmonary circulation and reproduced the characteristic transition of pulmonary vasculopathy from reversibility to irreversibility within a relatively short period. Thus, this model could offer an alternative with low mortality and high reproducibility for investigations on the underling mechanisms of shunt-related pulmonary hypertension.

84889240238	Status quo of hybrid coronary revascularization for multi-vessel coronary artery disease	Hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) combines bypass grafting of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of non-LAD vessels. HCR has been performed as an alternative to CABG or multi-vessel PCI in thousands of patients since the late 1990s. In this review article, we provide an overview on patient selection, procedural sequence and timing, use of surgical techniques and anti-platelet agents. Additionally, patient recovery, satisfaction, costs and clinical outcomes of individual studies after HCR are evaluated. Future directions are also discussed, including the need for adequately powered randomized trials. © 2013 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

84890552635	SinoSCORE: A logistically derived additive prediction model for post-coronary artery bypass grafting in-hospital mortality in a Chinese population	This study aims to construct a logistically derived additive score for predicting in-hospital mortality risk in Chinese patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Data from 9839 consecutive CABG patients in 43 Chinese centers were collected between 2007 and 2008 from the Chinese Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Registry. This database was randomly divided into developmental and validation subsets (9:1). The data in the developmental dataset were used to develop the model using logistic regression. Calibration and discrimination characteristics were assessed using the validation dataset. Thresholds were defined for each model to distinguish different risk groups. After excluding 275 patients with incomplete information, the overall mortality rate of the remaining 9564 patients was 2.5%. The SinoSCORE model was constructed based on 11 variables: age, preoperative NYHA stage III or IV, chronic renal failure, extracardiac arteriopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, preoperative atrial fibrillation or flutter (within 2 weeks), left ventricular ejection fraction, other elective surgery, combined valve procedures, preoperative critical state, and BMI. In the developmental dataset, calibration using a Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test was at P = 0.44 and discrimination based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was 0.80. In the validation dataset, the HL test was at P = 0.34 and the area under the ROC (AUC) was 0.78. A logistically derived additive model for predicting in-hospital mortality among Chinese patients undergoing CABG was developed based on the most up-to-date multi-center data from China. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84890908393	Establishment of a novel rat model without blood priming during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass	Objective: An effective animal model was needed for research on the pathophysiology of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Rat models were considered suitable for research into CPB, recently. The aim of the article is to establish a simple and safe CPB model without blood priming in rats, containing the advantages of controlling temperature precisely, being similar to the clinical process and laying the foundation for the further study of a deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) model. Materials and Methods: Ten Sprague-Dawley rats, divided into a CPB group (n=7) and a sham group (n=3), received sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia and were maintained in an anesthesia state by intubation. The entire CPB circuit consisted of a reservoir, a membrane oxygenator, a roller pump, a heat exchanger and a heat cooler, all of which were connected via silicon tubes. The volume of the priming solution, composed of 6% HES130/0.4 and 125 IU heparin, was less than 12 ml. In the CPB group, a 22G catheter was placed in the left femoral artery for monitoring arterial blood pressure, a 20G catheter was placed in a tail artery for arterial inflow and a homemade, multiorificed catheter was inserted into a right jugular vein for venous drainage. After 90 minutes, the CPB process was terminated when vital signs were stable. In the sham group, the same surgical process was conducted except for the venous drainage. Post-oxygenator blood gas and hemodynamic parameters were measured at each time point before CPB, during CPB and after CPB. Results: All CPB processes were successfully achieved. Blood gas analysis and hemodynamic parameters of each time point were in accordance with normal ranges. The vital signs of all rats were stable. Conclusion: The establishment of CPB without blood priming in rats can be achieved successfully. The rat model could be used to study short-term or long-term organ injury mechanisms caused by CPB. Furthermore, on the basis of the precise control of temperature and the depth of anesthesia, the DHCA model in rats could be developed further to study pathophysiological changes of neurological and other organ functions in the future. © 2013 The Author(s).

84891723635	Management of focal atrial tachycardias originating from the atrial appendage with the combination of radiofrequency catheter ablation and minimally invasive atrial appendectomy	Background Focal atrial tachycardias (ATs) originating from the left and the right atrial appendage (AA) were the most difficult to eliminate. Objective To evaluate the safety and long-term efficacy of minimally invasive surgical atrial appendectomy in combination with radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) in the management of focal atrial appendage tachycardias (AATs). Methods We included 42 consecutive patients with 42 AATs confirmed by activation mapping and contrast venography. Thirty of them were successfully managed with RFCA (RFCA-successful group), while the remaining 12 (28.6%) finally resorted to video-assisted thoracoscopic atrial appendectomy owing to RFCA failure (resort-to-surgery group). We searched for predictors of RFCA failure, and the need for surgery by using a binomial logistic regression model. Results In the RFCA-successful group, 6 (20.0%) patients experienced recurrence and re-do ablation and 11 (36.7%) AATs originated from distal AAs. In the resort-to-surgery group, the tachycardias involved exclusively distal AAs and required more RFCA attempts compared with those of the RFCA-successful group (1.58 ± 0.51 vs 1.20 ± 0.41; P =.0165). During atrial appendectomy, incessant ATs were terminated immediately after resection of the AA at the base. Long-term success was achieved in all 42 patients with a follow-up of 29.1 ± 17.5 months. No complications occurred. Fourteen patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy recovered fully. We identified origin at distal AATs and longer time to tachycardia termination by ablation as predictors of RFCA failure and the need for surgical intervention. Conclusion ATs originating from the distal portion of AA were more refractory to RFCA. The combination of catheter ablation and video-assisted thoracoscopic atrial appendectomy was an effective strategy to manage AATs. © 2014 Heart Rhythm Society. All rights reserved.

84898539598	Impaired myocardium energetics associated with the risk for new-onset atrial fibrillation after isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery	BACKGROUND: New-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is one of the most common complications occurring in 10-40% of patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Recent studies suggest that dysmetabolism may contribute to the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation; however, the putative mechanism in patients undergoing CABG surgery is unknown. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) has been demonstrated as a master regulator of myocardial energy metabolism, and glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) has both a higher affinity for glucose and a much greater transport capacity compared with GLUT1, GLUT2, and GLUT4. We sought to evaluate the role of energy metabolism, especially the glucose metabolism, on patients after isolated CABG surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: Right atrial appendages were obtained from 79 patients who were in normal sinus rhythm and undergoing isolated CABG; those who exhibited new-onset POAF (n=22) or remained in sinus rhythm (n=57) were prospectively matched on the basis of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative characteristics. POAF was assessed by electrocardiogram and must have required the initiation of antiarrhythmic therapy or anticoagulation. Local PGC-1α and GLUT3 concentrations were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in tissue homogenates. The comparison of mRNA expression was tested by quantitative real-time PCR. PGC-1α and GLUT3 levels and the related protein mRNA expression were significantly reduced in POAF patients compared with controls (P<0.05). This selective reduction in PGC-1α was associated with the presence of diabetes mellitus (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients who have low PGC-1α and GLUT3 levels are at increased risk for new-onset POAF. The myofibrillar energetic impairment may be important in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

84898727107	Interleukin-6 receptor rs7529229 T/C polymorphism is associated with left main coronary artery disease phenotype in a Chinese population	Left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) is a particular severe phenotype of coronary artery disease (CAD) and heritability. Interleukin (IL) may play important roles in the pathogenesis of CAD. Although several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in IL related genes have been evaluated for their roles in inflammatory diseases and CAD predisposition, the investigations between genetic variants and CAD phenotype are limited. We hypothesized that some of these gene SNPs may contribute to LMCAD phenotype susceptibility compared with more peripheral coronary artery disease (MPCAD). In a hospital-based case-only study, we studied IL-1A rs1800587 C/T, IL-1B rs16944 G/A, IL-6 rs1800796 C/G, IL-6R rs7529229 T/C, IL-8 rs4073 T/A, IL-10 rs1800872 A/C, and IL-10 rs1800896 A/G SNPs in 402 LMCAD patients and 804 MPCAD patients in a Chinese population. Genotyping was done using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and ligation detection reaction (LDR) method. When the IL-6R rs7529229 TT homozygote genotype was used as the reference group, the CC or TC/CC genotypes were associated with the increased risk for LMCAD (CC vs. TT, adjusted odds ratio(OR) = 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-2.11, p = 0.042; CC + TC vs. TT, adjusted OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.02-1.69, p = 0.037). None of the other six SNPs achieved any significant differences between LMCAD and MPCAD. The present study suggests that IL-6R rs7529229 T/C functional SNP may contribute to the risk of LMCAD in a Chinese population. However, our results were limited. Validation by a larger study from a more diverse ethnic population is needed. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84901757551	Influence of diabetes mellitus on long-term clinical and economic outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting	Background China has the most patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) in the world and, annually, approximately 1 million Chinese become diabetic. We investigated both clinical and economic outcomes in a large Chinese cohort of diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Methods All 9,240 consecutive patients who underwent isolated, primary, elective CABG between January 1999 and December 2008 were included and analyzed for long-term major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and economic outcomes up to 2 years after the procedure. The DM patients were divided into DM subgroups controlled by diet (n = 375), medication (n = 1,826) or insulin (n = 481). Results During the study period, the proportion of patients undergoing CABG who have DM increased from 20.1% to 31.8% in China. None of the DM subgroups was independently associated with in-hospital death, but DM was an independent predictor for long-term major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval: 1.14 to 1.46). Medically controlled DM and insulin-dependent DM, but not diet-controlled DM were independent predictors of long-term outcomes after CABG. Cost for initial hospitalization was higher for DM patients (76,782 Ren Min Bi [RMB] versus 65,521 RMB, respectively; p < 0.001). At 2 years after CABG, costs for DM patients were 11,261 RMB (approximately US $1,623) higher than for non-DM patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions CABG for patients with DM was significantly more expensive and was associated with worse long-term outcomes compared with non-DM patients. The rising incidence of DM, combined with the significant incremental costs represents significant clinical, economic, and social challenges for the Chinese healthcare system. © 2014 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Published by Elsevier Inc.

84902260776	Remote ischemic preconditioning reduces cardiac troponin i release in cardiac surgery: A meta-analysis	Objectives To determine whether remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) reduces myocardial injury, mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization in cardiac surgery. Design Meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials. The primary outcome was cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations. Secondary outcomes included cardiac troponin T (cTnT) concentrations, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure requiring hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, inotropic score, mechanical ventilation time, length of intensive care unit stay, length of hospital stay, and death. Setting University hospitals. Patients Adult and pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting, valve procedures, and correction of congenital cardiac anomalies. Interventions Remote ischemic preconditioning through limb ischemia. Measurements and Main Results Nineteen randomized trials involving 1,235 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The cTnI concentrations at 6 (or 4-8) hours postoperatively and the total cTnI released after surgery showed a statistically significant reduction in the RIPC group compared with a control group (weighted mean difference [WMD] -2.03 ug/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.25 to -0.82 ug/L, p = 0.001; WMD -65.74 ug/L*h, 95% CI -107.88 to -23.61 ug/L*h, p = 0.002, respectively). There were no differences in mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization between groups. Conclusions Current evidence suggests that RIPC reduces cardiac troponin I release in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The clinical significance of these observations merits further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84904626432	National trend in congenital heart disease mortality in China during 2003 to 2010: A population-based study	Background Previous studies suggest that mortality from congenital heart diseases (CHDs) is declining in the United States. But we do not know what the CHD mortality trend is in China, especially the rural versus urban patterns. Our study aimed to determine recent changes in death caused by CHD in China and describe CHD mortality in rural and urban Chinese populations. Methods The data source was the China Ministry of Health 2003 to 2010 annual reports. Mortality was defined as death caused by CHD. Mortality rates for each year were calculated per 10,000,000 person-years. Poisson regression and descriptive analyses were conducted for overall trend and subgroup analysis was conducted by sex, age, and urban versus rural residency to understand potential disparities in mortality. Results From 2003 to 2010, the overall mortality rate increased from 141 per 10,000,000 person-years in 2003 to 229 per 10,000,000 person-years in 2010, a 62.4% relative increase. This represents a region-sex adjusted annual increase of 9% (incidence rate ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.10). The increase in CHD mortality was not uniformly observed across age groups, urban versus rural residence, and sex. The relative increases were 65.3%, 212.2%, and 131.7% for ages 1 to 10 years, 21 to 64 years, and 65 years or older groups, respectively. Urban areas had a relative increase of 154.5% versus 5.3% for rural areas. Females who lived in an urban environment had a relative increase of 313.5%. Conclusions Our observation showed an obvious increasing trend of CHD mortality in China. What is more, the increase in CHD mortality was not uniformly observed across subgroups. Such information is needed for strategy-making procedures. Copyright © 2014 by The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

84905862540	Plasma levels of microRNA-499 provide an early indication of perioperative myocardial infarction in coronary artery bypass graft patients	Background: Recent studies indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) were important for many biological and pathological processes, and they might be potential biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases. The present study aims to determine the release patterns of miRNAs in cardiac surgery and to analyze the ability of miRs to provide early prediction of perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Methodology/Principal Findings: Thirty on-pump CABG patients were recruited in this study; and miR-499, miR-133a and miR-133b, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were selected for measurement. Serial plasma samples were collected at seven perioperative time points (preoperatively, and 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after declamping) and were tested for cTnI and miRs levels. Importantly, miR levels peaked as early as 1-3 hours, whereas cTnI levels peaked at 6 hours after declamping. Peak plasma concentrations of miRs correlated significantly with cTnI (miR-499, r = 0.583, P = 0.001; miR-133a, r = 0.514, P = 0.006; miR-133b, r = 0.437, P = 0.05), indicating the degree of myocardial damage. In addition, 30 off-pump CABG patients were recruited; miR-499 and miR-133a levels were tested, which were significantly lower in off-pump group than in on-pump group. A prospective cohort of CABG patients (n = 120) was recruited to study the predictive power of miRs for PMI. The diagnosis of PMI strictly adhered to the principles of universal definition of myocardial infarction. The data analysis revealed that miR-499 had higher sensitivity and specificity than cTnI, and indicated that miR-499 could be an independent risk factor for PMI. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that circulating miR-499 is a novel, early biomarker for identifying perioperative myocardial infarction in cardiac surgery. ©2014 Yao et al.

84907504731	Totally toracoscopic versus open surgery for closure of atrial septal defect: Propensity-score matched comparison	The purpose of this study is to compare early clinical outcomes of surgical repair for isolated atrial septal defect (ASD) with a totally thoracoscopic approach without robotic assistance versus a conventional open procedure. Between September 2010 and June 2012, 254 consecutive patients with isolated ASD underwent totally thoracoscopic surgery without robotic assistance in seven institutions participating in the nationwide multi-centered registry in China. During the same period, these patients were matched using propensity score methodology with 254 patients who had accepted conventional open surgery through a median sternotomy. The early in-hospital results between the two groups were analyzed and compared. The patient age was 26.8 ± 14.0 years and weight was 52.9 ± 16.9 kg in the totally thoracoscopic group. The totally thoracoscopic surgery required longer aortic clamp time (32.1 ± 17.3 minutes versus 28.3 ± 16.7 minutes, P =.01); shorter length of stay in the intensive care unit (25.3 ± 12.2 hours versus 34.8 ± 24.4 hours, P =.001); shorter length of stay in hospital (6.5 ± 6.3 days versus 7.9 ± 6.4 days, P =.008); and shorter mechanical ventilation time (8.3 ± 5.0 hours versus 11.4 ± 14.8 hours, P =.04). The cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (62.7 ± 29.3 minutes versus 61.5 ± 28.0 minutes, P =.64) showed no significant difference between the two groups. The totally thoracoscopic group had significantly less postoperative chest tube drainage (322.1 ± 213.7 mL versus 462.8 ± 398.4 mL, P =.001). The intraoperative (35.4% versus 38.6%, P =.46) and postoperative blood products usage (20.9% versus 21.3%, P =.91) showed no significant difference between the two groups. There also was no significant difference in mortality and major in-hospital complications between the two groups. The early outcomes for treatment of isolated ASD were similar between the totally thoracoscopic group conventional open operation performed through median sternotomy, despite a longer aortic clamp time in the totally thoracoscopic group.

84907466107	A polymorphism in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha, rs7310409, is associated with left main coronary artery disease	Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the world. Left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) is a particularly severe phenotypic form of CAD and has a genetic basis. We hypothesized that some inflammation- and hyperhomocysteinemia-related gene polymorphisms may contribute to LMCAD susceptibility in a Chinese population. We studied the association between polymorphisms in the genes hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A; rs7310409, G/A), C-reactive protein (rs1800947 and rs3093059 T/C), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (rs1801133, C/T), and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (rs1076991, A/G) in 402 LMCAD and 804 more peripheral CAD patients in a Chinese population. Genotyping was performed using the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry method. When the HNF1A rs7310409 GG homozygote genotype was used as the reference group, both the individual, GA and AA, and combined GA/AA genotypes were associated with an increased risk of LMCAD. This single nucleotide polymorphism (rs7310409) is strongly associated with plasma CRP levels. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that the HNF1A rs7310409 G/A functional polymorphism may contribute to the risk of LMCAD.
