13944261573	Using maximum entropy model for Chinese text categorization	With the rapid development of World Wide Web, text classification has become the key technology in organizing and processing large amount of document data. Maximum entropy model is a probability estimation technique widely used for a variety of natural language tasks. It offers a clean and accommodable frame to combine diverse pieces of contextual information to estimate the probability of a certain linguistics phenomena. This approach for many tasks of NLP performs near state-of-the-art level, or outperform other competing probability methods when trained and tested under similar conditions. However, relatively little work has been done on applying maximum entropy model to text categorization problems. In addition, no previous work has focused on using maximum entropy model in classifying Chinese documents. Maximum entropy model is used for text categorization. Its categorization performance is compared and analyzed using different approaches for text feature generation, different number of feature and smoothing technique. Moreover, in experiments it is compared to Bayes, KNN and SVM, and it is shown that its performance is higher than Bayes and comparable with KNN and SVM. It is a promising technique for text categorization.

13944264331	Simple and efficient algorithm to classify a large scale of texts	Most of classifying methods are based on VSM (vector space model) in the research on classification at present, of which the widely-used method is kNN (k-nearest neighbors). But most of them are highly complicated on computation, and cannot be used on the occasion of classifying a large number of specimen. Moreover, to them, the classifier must be rebuilt when to increment the corpora of the training specimen. So they have tough scalability. Two new concepts, MD (mutual dependence) and ER (equivalent radius), are put forward in this paper. Furthermore, a new classifying method, SECTILE, is offered. SECTILE can be used to classify a large number of specimen and has good scalability. Later, SECTILE is applied to classify Chinese documents and compared to kNN and CCC method. As a result, SECTILE outperforms kNN and CCC method, and can be used online to classify a large number of specimen while the precision and recall of classification are kept.

1542299072	Sentences clustering based automatic summarization	There are two ways by which the research on automatic summarization is carried out. One is based on statistics, and the other is based on message understanding. The former has nothing to do with domain, but its accuracy is lower; On the contrary, the later depends on domain, but its accuracy is higher. In this paper, an algorithm, which summarizes a document by extracting subtopics from the sentences, is based on statistics and partially understanding message, in order to get better summarization and get rid of the dependence on domain. Besides, since it is difficult to determine the length of a summary manually, the algorithm also strives to obtain a better summary with proper length. To this end, a new module of mutual dependence is put forward too and applied to segmentation, which can select accuracy features for the summarizing algorithm. And then new rules are brought forward to evaluate sentences for the summarizing algorithm. Furthermore, a new task-based algorithm to evaluating summarization impersonally is offered.

A fuzzy controller is designed to stabilize the uncertain nonlinear systems whose states are unobservable. The uncertain nonlinear discrete systems are represented by Takigi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models, and local dynamics in different state-space regions are represented by nonlinear models with uncertainty.

33747751974	Influence of quantum degeneracy on the performance of a gas Stirling engine cycle	Based on the state equation of an ideal quantum gas, the regenerative loss of a Stirling engine cycle working with an ideal quantum gas is calculated. Thermal efficiency of the cycle is derived. Furthermore, under the condition of quantum degeneracy, several special thermal efficiencies are discussed. Ratios of thermal efficiencies versus the temperature ratio and volume ratio of the cycle are made. It is found that the thermal efficiency of the cycle not only depends on high and low temperatures but also on maximum and minimum volumes. In a classical gas state the thermal efficiency of the cycle is equal to that of the Carnot cycle. In an ideal quantum gas state the thermal efficiency of the cycle is smaller than that of the Carnot cycle. This will be significant for deeper understanding of the gas Stirling engine cycle. © 2006 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.

The used corpora are the European Parliament's conference summary. The implemented approaches are the evaluation of bi or trigram, the Garbling model and the edit-distance approach. The evaluation shows that the evaluation of N-gram is unsuitable for correction of non-word errors, however can be applied to the recognition and correction of other errors. The Garbling model obtains good correction results, in general, but does not suit all error types. The edit-distance approach achieves the best results by the correction of non-word errors.

35248864334	Probability-based autonomous identification of faulty links in satellite communication networks	Satellite systems are going to be an important part of the future personal communication infrastructure. The first-generation candidates for satellite personal communication networks will rely on low earth orbiting (LEO) and medium earth orbiting (MEO) constellations. A robust asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)-based routing algorithm for LEO satellite systems employing intersatellite links (ISL) was proposed, by which a source satellite can communicate with any end satellite, so long as a path exists between the source satellite and the destination satellite.

The simulation in satellite networks shows that the algorithm has the features of real-time and accuracy, needs a few or perhaps doesn t need extra bandwidth.

As the PDF estimator is calculated from actual TOA samples, it is adaptive for the complex practical NLOS environments. The simulation results also indicate that with the less prior information about communication environments, the approach we present has a good location performance even in severe NLOS situations. © 2006 IEEE.

As for the concrete pump truck, the arm system is the most important because the rationality of the arm directly influences the performance and pouring position of the truck in its application in civil engineering. For the arm system of the concrete pump truck, the movement of the arm system and the hydraulic cylinder are analyzed respectively with multi-body dynamic theory. By using numerical arithmetic to resolve the dynamic equation, the terminal track of the arms is analyzed.

84869017274	A coordinated primary frequency regulation from permanent magnet synchronous wind turbine generation	As a growing number of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Wind Turbine Generations (PMSG-WT) are integrated into the modern power grid, there has been a great concern for system operators who expects PMSG-WT to play an active role in the primary frequency regulation when frequency event occurs. However, PMSG-WTs are still unable to provide any additional active power in response to the system frequency change. In this work, a control scheme of coordinated frequency regulation for DFIG in [1] is redesigned and implemented into a PMSG-WT model by synthesizing the inertial control, over-rotor speed control and pitch angle control. Inertial control emulates the total inertia response of both wind turbine and generator to provide a short-term frequency support. According to the de-loaded optimum power extraction curve, the over-rotor speed and pitch angle controls are coordinated to maintain the reserved power and meanwhile assist the primary frequency regulation in a long-term period. The coordinated control strategy of PMSG-WT comprises the low, medium and high wind speed modes. By this means, the comprehensive control method will promote the PMSG-based wind farms to effectively participate in the system frequency regulation under a full scope of wind speed conditions. © 2012 IEEE.

84868351298	Modeling and simulation of flexible hydraulic robotic arm	The flexible robotic arm drived by hydraulic are widely applied in most kinds of large engineering equipments, such as concrete pump truck, bridge monitor truck,etc. Nevertheless, the flexible distortion always break the precision of end-position and cause liberation of the whole arm system. In this paper, the movement of flexible hydraulic robotic arm and hydraulic cylinders are separately analyzed with flexible multi-body dynamics. And the dynamic differential equation is built with the driving force of the hydraulic cylinder as the main force. The equation is based on the theory of flexible multi-body dynamics, building the coupled model of robotic arm system and hydraulic-driving system to study the relation between the end-position, angle and the hydraulic system. What's more, the simulation model of the mechanical arms is built by the dynamic simulation software.

84868630471	Multi-vehicle tracking based traffic illegal parking detection	Vehicle detection and tracking are the foundations of traffic violation punishment. The current methods have more parameters to be adjusted and can not adapt to the complex traffic scenes. For the purpose of practice application, we propose an illegal parking detection algorithm based on vehicle tracking theory. In order to filter the dynamic interferences such as vehicles parking for a long time, moving vehicles overlapping, and the vehicle losing momentarily from the video, a Gaussian mixture model is combined with the correlations among adjacent pixels to update background and eliminate noises. In allusion to complex traffic scenes, a fast multi-object tracking algorithm is presented to track occluded vehicles effectively. This method predicts vehicle trajectory by Kalman filter and achieves real-time object tracking state judgment by using the feature matching matrix. The experimental results show that this method can track multiple moving vehicles effectively and has high detection precision for illegal parking incidents. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84872344843	Establishment and optimization of prediction model for recovery rate of alloying elements	Steel quality depends on the alloying model precision. While the precision is mainly dependent on the recovery rate of alloying elements calculation, the prediction model for recovery rate of alloying elements was established based on the BP neural network. The simulation shows that using POS algorithm to optimize the model is still easy to fall into local minimum, so a simulated annealing (SA) thought was introduced to improve it. By the comparison we can see that SA-PSO algorithm can overcome above shortcomings. This algorithm strengthens the global convergence ability. It can optimize the model while ensuring high precision and improve the training convergence rate at the same time. The simulation results proved that this model is effective. © 2012 IEEE.

84878750197	A new construction method of membership function for interval type-2 fuzzy sets	There are several problems in the construction method of membership function for interval type-2 fuzzy sets, such as it requires that subjects are knowledgeable about fuzzy sets, footprint of uncertainty (FOU) is filled in or almost filled in (lower membership function is approximately zero), and the shape of an FOU must be chosen ahead of time. In order to solve these problems, a novel construction method of membership function for interval type-2 fuzzy sets was proposed based on a question design for subjects who are not limited to experts of fuzzy sets. The proposed method did not need to choose the shape of a FOU. The basic idea of the method could be concluded as follows. First, the interval data for upper membership degree and lower membership degree of a word was collected from domain experts. Then, the interval data would be preprocessed. And at last, the membership function and footprint of uncertainty for the word would be obtained. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can establish membership function for interval type-2 fuzzy sets effectively and can avoid the FOU to be filled in or almost filled in.

84882749595	Application of soft sensor in welding seam tracking prediction based on LSSVM and PSO with compression factor	There are some problems with the strip steel heated in the annealing furnace such as the multiple correlations between temperature in the annealing furnace, steel strip tension, tension roll speed and other variables, noise in field data, which lead to the difficulty to predict the time of welding seam achieved air-knife. The least square support vector machine (LSSVM) inductance model optimized by the particle swarm optimization with compression factor (PSO-CF) algorithm is presented for the difficulty of the time prediction in this paper. The improved algorithm can improve PSO convergence accuracy, and effectively avoid falling into local optimum. It can be both the global fitting ability and local fitting ability of least squares support vector machine. The parameters of LSSVM model are optimized by improved PSO-CF algorithm to escape from the blindness of man-made choice. Using the algorithm in prediction of the arrival time and the position of welding seam, the numerical simulation results illustrate good generalization performance and prediction ability of the proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.

84882782098	Adaptive controller design for upper-limb rehabilitation robot	This paper studies the problem of robust output feedback control for a class of upper-limb rehabilitation robot, which can assist with shoulder, elbow and wrist joint movements. The proposed controller can guarantee the robustness of the robotic system in the presence of model uncertainties, as well as the ultimate boundedness of the presented adaptive observer-based controller. An obvious advantage of the proposed method is that the implemented information for feedback is only the measurement of position. Without additional sensors, the information of velocity and acceleration is provided by an adaptive observer. By utilizing a novel adaptive logic-based switching control scheme, a trajectory tracking performance is well achieved with a tunable error bound. Finally, a simulation example verif es the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. © 2013 IEEE.

84885068206	Improvement of enhanced Karnik-Mendel algorithm for interval type-2 fuzzy sets	Type reduction is the work of computing the centroid of a type-2 fuzzy set. At present, most of type reduction methods have high computational cost. The enhanced Karnik-Mendel(EKM) algorithm can compute the centroid of an interval type-2 fuzzy set efficiently. However, the initialization of the switch point in the EKM algorithm is not a good one, and the computation time is long, which makes a limit on the application in real system. In view of these problems, a novel improved EKM algorithm is developed for improving the EKM algorithm. The proposed algorithm provides two improvements on the EKM algorithm. Firstly, the initialization conditions of switch points are changed. Then, the method of searching for switch points is improved, in which can search upward and downward. The number of computations involved is greatly reduced and type reduction can be done much more efficiently. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

84897437919	Efficiency at maximum power output of a quantum-mechanical brayton cycle	The performance in finite time of a quantum-mechanical Brayton engine cycle is discussed, without introduction of temperature. The engine model consists of two quantum isoenergetic and two quantum isobaric processes, and works with a single particle in a harmonic trap. Directly employing the finite-time thermodynamics, the efficiency at maximum power output is determined. Extending the harmonic trap to a power-law trap, we find that the efficiency at maximum power is independent of any parameter involved in the model, but depends on the confinement of the trapping potential. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84913583282	Coefficient of performance under maximum χ criterion in a two-level atomic system as a refrigerator	A two-level atomic system as a working substance is used to set up a refrigerator consisting of two quantum adiabatic and two isochoric processes (two constant-frequency processes ωa and ωb with ωa<ωb), during which the two-level system is in contact with two heat reservoirs at temperatures Th and Tc(<Th). Considering finite-time operation of two isochoric processes, we derive analytical expressions for cooling rate R and coefficient of performance (COP) . The COP at maximum χ(=R) figure of merit is numerically determined, and it is proved to be in nice agreement with the so-called Curzon and Ahlborn COP CA=1+C-1, where C=Tc/(Th-Tc) is the Carnot COP. In the high-temperature limit, the COP at maximum χ figure of merit, ∗, can be expressed analytically by ∗=+≡(9+8C-3)/2, which was derived previously as the upper bound of optimal COP for the low-dissipation or minimally nonlinear irreversible refrigerators. Within the context of irreversible thermodynamics, we prove that the value of + is also the upper bound of COP at maximum χ figure of merit when we regard our model as a linear irreversible refrigerator.
