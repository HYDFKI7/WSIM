22244463604	Humoral and cellular immune response after measles vaccination in Taiwan	Measles immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroepidemiologic studies have been widely used to monitor the effectiveness of measles immunization programs in Taiwan. However, studies about cellular immunity against the measles virus have been lacking. This study surveyed cellular immunity after measles, mumps and rubella combined vaccine (MMR) immunization in Taiwan. Seventy six people between 1 and 80 years of age were enrolled. All patients lived in northern Taiwan, and none of them had immunodeficient disease. Every enrolled patient donated a tube of heparinized blood between January 2004 and June 2004 for cross-sectional studies of IgG seroepidemiologic and MMR-specific lymphoproliferative response. The results showed that the current 3-dose (measles × 1 + MMR × 2) measles immunization program induced slightly higher IgG seroprevalence (100% vs 85%, p=0.244) and a higher frequency of significant (stimulation indices ≥3) MMR-specific lymphoproliferative response (50% vs 15%, p=0.044) than a 2-dose (measles × 1 + MMR × 1) immunization program, although there was no difference in IgG titers and stimulation indices. Furthermore, the population aged older than 36 years (pre-immunization era) had higher IgG titers and seroprevalence, and similar MMR-specific lymphoproliferative responses to that of the population aged younger than 36 years (post-immunization era). In summary, with the limited data, the current 3-dose (measles × 1 + MMR × 2) measles immunization policy probably more effectively induces humoral and cellular immunity than the 2-dose (measles × 1 + MMR × 1) policy. Measles IgG seroprevalence in populations of different age groups exceeds nearly 90%. Measles has been eliminated temporarily in Taiwan. For a better understanding of the durability of vaccine-induced immunity and in order to establish the most appropriate immunization schedule, long-term and large-scale prospective studies of measles-specific seroepidemiology and cellular immunity will be needed.

21244500972	A nationwide survey on epidemiological characteristics of childhood Henoch-Schönlein purpura in Taiwan	Objective. To evaluate the annual incidence and other epidemiological characteristics of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) among children in Taiwan. Methods. The records of patients were derived from the research database of the Bureau of National Health Insurance, Taiwan, Republic of China, from January 1999 to December 2002. Children younger than 17 yr of age with the diagnosis of HSP were included into this study. Data for each patient including sex, age, date of onset and length of hospitalization were recorded and analysed. Results. A total of 2759 cases were included with an annual incidence of 12.9 (11.8-13.4) per 100000 children <17yr of age. The occurrence of HSP had a peak at the age of 5 to 6 yr. In this study, 1118 (40.5%) patients had been hospitalized at some stage. There were 1454 males and 1305 females, for a male to female ratio of 1.11. Males had a higher annual incidence before the age of 10 yr (P = 0.04), and had a lower incidence than females at older ages (P = 0.02). Disease onset was more common in autumn and winter, and no apparent change in seasonal pattern was noted over 4 yr. Conclusions. Insurance claim data provide useful information on the epidemiology of HSP in Taiwan. Childhood HSP in Taiwan, with an incidence of 12.9 per 100000 children, occurs commonly in autumn and winter; and at the age of 5 to 6 yr. The characteristics presented in this study may provide valuable data for understanding and further studies of HSP. © The Author 2005.

23044444782	Autoantibodies against human epithelial cells and endothelial cells after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus infection	The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and characterized by severe pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In this study, the development of autoantibodies against human epithelial cells and endothelial cells in patients with SARS at different time periods (the first week: phase I, 1 month after the disease onset: phase II/phase III) were investigated. Antibodies in sera of patients and healthy controls against: (1) A549 human pulmonary epithelial cell-line, (2) human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC), (3) primary human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPEC) were detected by cell-based ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence staining. The results revealed that serum levels of IgG anti-A549 cells antibodies, IgG anti-HUVEC antibodies, and IgM anti-HPEC antibodies were significantly higher in SARS patients at phase II/phase III than those in healthy controls. Sera from SARS patients at phase II/phase III could mediate complement dependent cytotoxicity against some A549 cells and HPEC. It is concluded that some autoantibodies against human epithelial cells and endothelial cells would be developed after SARS-CoV infection and this phenomenon may indicate post-infectious cellular injury and also induce SARS-induced immunopathology. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

24044489885	Renal manifestations in Henoch-Schönlein purpura: A 10-year clinical study	Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is an IgA-mediated systemic small vessel vasculitis of childhood. It is characterized by the symptoms including nonthrombocytopenic purpura, abdominal pain, hematuria/ proteinuria, and arthargia/arthritis. We conducted a retrospective study of 261 patients diagnosed with HSP from December 1991 to December 2001. Of the 261 patients, fifty-three (20.3%) developed renal manifestations after onset of the disease. Two patients developed nephrotic syndrome. Four patients had group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis and subsequent depressed serum C3 concentration typical of post streptococcal glomerulonephritis. During the study period, the renal survival rate after disease onset was 100%. The prognosis of renal involvement was better than reports from other series. In this study we also found factors associated with HSP nephritis; these included older age at onset, GI bleeding, and central nervous system involvement. The long-term morbidity of HSP is predominantly attributed to renal involvement. It is thus recommended that patients with HSP nephritis are followed for longer periods of time. © IPNA 2005.

29144502416	Long-term follow-up of hepatitis B surface antibody levels in subjects receiving universal hepatitis B vaccination in infancy in an area of hyperendemicity: Correlation between radioimmunoassay and enzyme immunoassay	The aims of the present study were to determine (i) the long-term immunogenicity and the decay rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antibody (anti-HBs) from universal hepatitis B vaccination at infancy for a healthy population in an area of hyperendemicity and (ii) whether the anti-HBs levels measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) were closely correlated with those assayed by radioimmunoassay (RIA) methods during long-term monitoring. A total of 1,337 apparently healthy children (696 boys and 641 girls) who were vaccinated against HBV at infancy and monitored for anti-HBs annually from 7 to 16 years of age entered the study. Serum samples were analyzed for anti-HBs by RIA at 7 to 15 years of age and were also analyzed by EIA at 13 to 16 years of age. Antibody titers were quantified in mIU/ml by EIA as well as by the ratio of the count in the sample to the count for a negative control (S/N) by RIA. In nonboosted children, the average decay of anti-HBs from 7 to 16 years of ages indicated that approximately 20% of the geometric mean titer decays per year. There was a good correlation between serum anti-HBs levels measured by the RIA and the EIA methods (r = 0.91; P < 0.0001). An equation for RIA to EIA level conversion was established: log EIA titer = -0.12 + (1.31 · log RIA S/N). The anti-HBs titers measured by EIA correlate well with the S/N assayed by RIA. The annual decay rate of the log anti-HBs level may help in planning booster immunizations for hyporesponders or individuals at risk in adolescence.

27844487558	Increased levels of serum-specific immunoglobulin E to staphylococcal enterotoxin A and B in patients with allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma	Background: The association between staphylococcal enterotoxins and atopic dermatitis (AD) is well characterized. We aim to evaluate the association between sensitization to staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) and/or B (SEB) and the development of allergic airway disease. Methods: Two hundred and seventy-four patients were grouped into allergic rhinitis (AR) and/or bronchial asthma (BA) only, AD only and AR/BA+AD. The AR/BA only group was further divided into AR only, AR and airway hyperresponsiveness (AR+AHR) and BA. The allergen-specific and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies were determined by the CAP system. The associations of sensitization to SEA/SEB with allergic airway disease were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Results: The overall rate of sensitization to SEA/SEB was 25.7%, whereas the rate of the AD only group (45.5%) was significantly higher than that of the AR/BA only group (24.5%, χ

33645846614	Circulating IgA from acute stage of childhood Henoch-Schönlein purpura can enhance endothelial interleukin (IL)-8 production through MEK/ERK signalling pathway	Recently, sera from children with active Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) have been found to enhance interleukin (IL)-8 production by human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC). To further determine the possible factor with the ability to enhance endothelial IL-8 production in sera from acute stage of HSP, 10 children with HSP at the acute stage and 10 healthy controls were enrolled. IgA antiendothelial cell antibodies (AECA) were detected by cell-based ELISA. Active sera with or without pretreatment with anti-human IgA antibody, sera of controls, and immunoglobulin A (IgA) derived from sera were used to stimulate the HUVEC. The ability of these factors to enhance endothelial IL-8 production was evaluated. Furthermore, signalling pathways were also assayed by different inhibitors, and confirmed by immunoblotting. Serum levels of IgA AECA in HPS patients at the acute stage were significantly higher than in controls (P < 0.001). The active sera could enhance endothelial IL-8 production (P = 0.004, compared with control sera), and the ability of these sera was mostly abolished when pretreated with fixed anti-human IgA antibody. The supernatant IL-8 levels of endothelial cells stimulated by IgA derived from acute stage of HSP were statistically higher than controls (P < 0.001). PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation, significantly reduced IgA AECA-stimulated endothelial IL-8. IgA AECA also enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK1 with a time-dependent manner. Together with these findings, it is concluded that IgA AECA derived from acute stage of HSP may bind to endothelial and enhance endothelial cells to produce IL-8 via MEK/REK signalling pathway. © 2006 British Society for Immunology.

33748879109	Adenovirus expressing interleukin-1 receptor antagonist alleviates allergic airway inflammation in a murine model of asthma	Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a proinflammatory cytokine and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) is a natural inhibitor that binds to IL-1 receptor type I without inducing signal transduction. It is suggested that IL-1 is required for allergen-specific T helper type 2 cell activation and the development of airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR), but the immunologic effect of exogenous IL-1ra in allergic asthma remains unclear. To examine the effect of IL-1ra on airway inflammation and immunoeffector cells in allergic asthma, recombinant adenovirus expressing human IL-1ra (Ad-hIL-1ra) was delivered intranasally into ovalbumin (OVA)-immunized mice. Single intranasal administration of Ad-hIL-1ra before airway antigen challenge in OVA-immunized mice significantly decreased the severity of AHR and reduced pulmonary infiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils. Suppression of IL-5 and eotaxin with concomitant enhancement of interferon gamma in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was also noted in OVA-immunized mice by administration of Ad-hIL-1ra. In addition, histological studies showed that Ad-hIL-1ra was able to decrease OVA-induced peribronchial inflammation. Taken together, our results indicated that administration of Ad-hIL-1ra may have therapeutic potential for the immunomodulatory treatment of allergic asthma.

33749509704	Antinucleosome antibodies correlate with the disease severity in children with systemic lupus erythematosus	We compared the serum levels of antinucleosome antibodies (anti-NCS Abs) in thirty pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to 29 adult SLE patients, 30 healthy controls, 21 juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and 23 Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) patients as autoimmune disease controls. The mean anti-NCS Ab titer in the pediatric SLE patients was 1552.7 ± 1842.2 U/ml, higher than those of adult SLE patients (194.3 ± 402.7 U/ml), normal controls (9.5 ± 5.7 U/ml) and disease controls (JIA: 7.7 ± 4.0 U/ml, HSP: 5.7 ± 4.4 U/ml) (p < 0.05). The prevalence of both anti-NCS Ab (90%) and anti-ds DNA Ab (76.7%) in pediatric SLE patients were higher (p < 0.05) than that of adult SLE patients (58.6% and 48.3%). A positive correlation was demonstrated between anti-NCS Ab and anti-dsDNA Ab as well as the SLEDAI scores in pediatric and adult patients (p < 0.05). The inverse correlation of anti-NCS Ab levels with C3 was observed in both pediatric and adult SLE patients (pediatrics, r = - 0.61, p = 0.0003; adult, r = - 0.44, p = 0.02). Our data suggested that in pediatric SLE patients, anti-NCS Ab could be as good a marker for SLE diagnosis and disease activity assessment as in adult SLE patients. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33750595166	Neuropsychiatric manifestations in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus: A 20-year study	The objective of this study was to investigate the manifestations, treatment and outcome of neuropsychiatric (NP) involvement in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. The charts of 185 pediatric patients with SLE diagnosed between 1985 and 2005 in a tertiary referral hospital were retrospectively reviewed. NPSLE were defined using the American College of Rheumatology NPSLE case definitions. NPSLE developed in 34.6% (64/185) of the patients. The mean onset age was 15.2 years. Fourteen patients (21.9%) had NP manifestations on initial diagnosis of SLE. The median duration from the onset of SLE to NP manifestation was 11 months. The most frequent NP manifestations were seizure disorder (84.4%), ischemic stroke (28.1%) and psychosis (21.9%). However, the prevalence of manifestations of NPSLE might be underestimated by the retrospective design of our study. Higher mean C3/C4 levels, less percentage of anti-dsDNA antibodies elevation and higher percentage of elevated anticardiolipin antibodies were observed in NPSLE events than in non-NPSLE events (P < 0.05). The mortality rate of NPSLE patients decreased from 52.2% in 1985-1994 cohort to 27.8% in 1995-2005 cohort. In the past 10 years, the leading cause of death in NPSLE patients was NPSLE itself. NPSLE is common in pediatric SLE patients. It has diverse manifestations and a high mortality. © 2006 SAGE Publications.

33846252330	Staphylococcus colonization in atopic dermatitis treated with fluticasone or tacrolimus with or without antibiotics	Background: The skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) exhibits a striking susceptibility to colonization and infection by Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment with topical anti-inflammatory drugs alone can reduce S aureus colonization. Objectives: To compare the clinical severity of AD and the S aureus colonization rate between AD patients treated with topical glucocorticoids and those treated with tacrolimus and to evaluate the effects of complementary topical antistaphylococcal antibiotic therapy and the development of fusidic acid-resistant S aureus. Methods: Sixty AD patients were enrolled in a prospective, parallel, randomized study of an 8-week treatment with topical 0.05% fluticasone propionate or 0.03% tacrolimus, with or without complementary fusidic acid. Disease severity scoring of AD based on SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), colonization rate and density of S aureus on the skin, and antibiotic susceptibility of S aureus isolates were evaluated. Results: The reduction in SCORAD scores correlated with the reduction of S aureus numbers. Treatment with topical tacrolimus resulted in a comparable reduction in SCORAD scores to fluticasone but a slower eradication of S aureus. Complementary fusidic acid had no additional benefit compared with fluticasone or tacrolimus alone. Two patients developed fusidic acid-resistant S aureus after 8 weeks of fusidic acid treatment. Conclusion: Tacrolimus is an appropriate alternative treatment for chronic AD. Topical anti-inflammatory therapy alone to improve the allergic skin inflammation of AD can reduce S aureus colonization of the skin. Topical antibiotics should be reserved for short-term use in obvious secondary bacterial infection.

33847694008	Thrombopoietin and interleukin-6 levels in Henoch-Schönlein purpura	Background and Purpose: Depending on the severity of the illness, thrombocytosis is found in about 60% to 70% of patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP). Whether thrombocytosis is the result of an inflammatory reaction mediated by thrombopoietin (TPO) or other inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 remains unknown. Methods: Thirty two patients who met the diagnostic criteria for HSP were included. They were divided into two groups - HSP patients with thrombocytosis (n = 14) and those without thrombocytosis (n = 18) with a platelet count of 400,000/μL. Eight normal healthy controls were also included. TPO and IL-6 serum levels during the acute phase were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Patients with platelet counts greater than 400,000/μL in the acute stage had significantly lower TPO levels than patients with platelet counts lower than 400,000/μL (310 ± 65.6 pg/mL vs 608 ± 97.8 pg/mL, p=0.013). However, HSP patients with or without thrombocytosis had similar TPO levels as the healthy controls (441 ± 176 pg/mL, p=0.89 and 0.29, respectively). IL-6 serum levels were significantly elevated in HSP patients during the acute stage of HSP (28.6 ± 61.7 pg/mL vs 3.16 ± 1.35 pg/mL, p=0.049). In patients with complications of glomerulonephritis or gastrointestinal hemorrhage (n = 12), IL-6 levels were significantly lower than in those without such complications (8.07 ± 3.79 pg/mL vs 40.9 ± 16.9 pg/mL, p=0.007). Conclusions: This study showed that thrombocytosis in HSP patients is a type of inflammatory reactive thrombocytosis, and that IL-6 may also play a role in the pathogenesis of HSP. © 2006 Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection.

33847728342	Abrupt temperature change triggers arthralgia in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis	Background and Purpose: Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is the most common form of arthritis in children and affects both quality of life and school attendance. Weather and temperature conditions are believed to affect joint pains; however, very few studies have investigated this issue. This study examined the association between joint pain in JRA patients and weather conditions. Methods: The daily pain ratings of 52 patients previously diagnosed with JRA were recorded on visual analog scales over 4 months beginning January 1,2004. These ratings were then compared with weather data to evaluate possible correlation between these two factors. Results: Twenty nine patients kept daily records during the first 2 months. There was no positive correlation between weather parameters (such as temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure) and pain ratings. Interestingly, the pain rating significantly increased the day after the advent of a cold wave (sign test, p<0.01 ; Wilcoxon signed ranks test, p=0.001). The number of patients who experienced joint swelling was not related to weather conditions. Twenty one participants continued maintaining the diaries during the next 2 months. The patients reported higher pain levels in the first 2 months during the cold wave period than in the next 2 months when the cold wave period had ended (p<0.001). Conclusion: A dramatic weather change such as a sudden cold wave might influence the experience of joint pain. © 2006 Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection.

34347374123	Ten-year experience of juvenile dermatomyositis: A retrospective study	Background and Purpose: Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDMS) is a rare multisystemic disease of unknown etiology that primarily affects muscle and skin. This study aimed to evaluate the initial laboratory data, clinical manifestations, complications, and clinical outcomes of patients with JDMS in Taiwan. Methods: We reviewed medical charts of patients younger than 18 years with a diagnosis of JDMS at the pediatric department of National Taiwan University Hospital between 1994 and 2004. Results: A total of 21 patients were included. The female-to-male ratio was 4.25:1. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 6.4 ± 3.7 years (range, 2 to 14.2 years). The mean age at diagnosis was 6.9 ± 3.9 years (range, 2.2 to 15 years). Among the initial cutaneous features, Gottron's rash (62%) and facial rash (including malar rash, 62%) were the most common findings. Gottron's rash was also the most common sign (81 %) at any time during the disease course. Among other systemic features at disease onset, myalgia (33%) was the most common symptom, followed by arthralgia (19%) and dysphagia (19%). Interstitial pneumonitis was a complication in 2 patients, one of whom was a mortality case. Gastrointestinal tract vasculitis was highly suspected in one patient complicated with duodenal perforation and retroperitoneal abscess. Calcinosis developed in 6 patients (28.5%), and one of these patients presented with disseminated calcinosis. Five of 21 patients achieved drug-free remission for 28 to 94 months from the time they discontinued therapy to the end of the study. Two patients with diagnosis of amyopathic dermatomyositis were also included in this study. Conclusions: The long-term outcomes in this study are thought to be good. Because the understanding of the pathogenesis of JDMS is limited, certain complications are still troublesome clinically. © 2007 Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection.

35748948406	Epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus infection in northern Taiwan, 2001-2005 - Seasonality, clinical characteristics, and disease burden	Background and Purpose: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important pathogen in children less than 2 years old. However, there is limited epidemiological data about RSV infection in Taiwan. This study aimed to investigate the clinical, epidemiological, virological, and economical aspects of RSV infections in Taiwan. Methods: We collected data of children with positive RSV respiratory specimens at the Laboratory of Virology, National Taiwan University Hospital, between January 2001 and December 2005. Medical charts were reviewed retrospectively. Results: 892 children in whom acute bronchiolitis was the predominant diagnosis (60.7%) were enrolled. Compared with those without underlying disease (n = 630), children with underlying disease (n = 262) were older (11 vs 9 months), required longer oxygen therapies (7 vs 4 days), were more likely to have lower respiratory tract involvement (96.2% vs 92.3%) and intensive care unit stays (49.0% vs 9.4%), endotracheal intubations (21.0% vs 2.0%), ribavirin use (35.0% vs 1.4%), and had higher medical costs (US$ 1250 vs 688), and nosocomial infection (24.8% vs 1.0%). Compared with those without endotracheal intubation (n = 824), cases requiring endotracheal intubation (n = 68) had higher rates of underlying diseases (80.9% vs 25.1 %), especially congenital heart diseases (45.6% vs 8.1%), chronic lung disease (13.2% vs 3.2%) and neurological disorders (17.6% vs 3.5%). There was a biennial pattern with peaks in the spring and fall. Medical cost was estimated to be US$ 250,000 annually in our hospital. Conclusion: In children with underlying diseases, RSV infection is associated with significant morbidity, and even mortality. Nosocomial infections appear to be an important cause of RSV transmission. The seasonality of RSV infections in Taiwan showed a biennial pattern with peaks in spring and fall. © 2007 Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection.

37349093731	Comparative usefulness of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis	Objective. To compare serial C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) patients and investigate their application as diagnostic parameters and prognostic predictive factors. Methods. We carried out retrospective chart review among JRA patients who were followed-up at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) between 1994 and 2005. Results. Thirty-nine girls and 68 boys were included in this study. At the time of diagnosis, the prevalence of ESR was significantly greater than that of CRP (86.8% vs. 47.2%, p < 0.05). ESR revealed more responsiveness to treatment compared to CRP (SRMs were -0.69 and -0.31, respectively). At the time of diagnosis, high CRP levels (≥ 5mg/dL) correlated with poor therapeutic response, as do positive CRP (>0.8 mg/dL) and high ESR levels (>40 mm/h) after treatment for six months. Overall, initial high CRP levels (≥ 5mg/dL) demonstrated the strongest predictive role of failure of the first remission. Conclusions. For disease diagnosis, ESR can be a better parameter than CRP but a high initial CRP level can strongly predict treatment failure of the first remission. © Copyright Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2007.

37849039217	Linoleic acid metabolite levels and transepidermal water loss in children with atopic dermatitis	Background: It has been suggested that atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with impaired δ-6 desaturase activity and the subsequent altered composition of n-6 essential fatty acids (EFAs). Objective: To investigate whether n-6 EFA deficiency accounts for AD by affecting transepidermal water loss or the immune response. Methods: Serum levels of n-6 EFAs were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in a well-defined group of 35 children with AD (IgE level >150 U/mL); 35 age-matched children with allergic rhinitis, asthma, or both (IgE level >150 U/mL); and 31 nonatopic controls (IgE level <100 U/mL). Skin barrier function was evaluated by measuring transepidermal water loss and severity of AD by computing the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index. Results: Atopic children had higher levels of linoleic acid (LA) and lower levels of its metabolites. Furthermore, γ-linolenic acid to LA and dihommo-γ-linolenic acid to LA ratios were significantly reduced in atopic patients. Transepidermal water loss and the SCORAD index were negatively correlated with serum levels of LA metabolites. There was no correlation between the SCORAD index and IgE level (P = .51) or between n-6 EFA concentrations and IgE level (P > .10). Conclusions: Deficits in n-6 EFAs were correlated with the severity of AD by affecting skin barrier function and cutaneous inflammation. The link between impaired n-6 EFA metabolism and IgE level could not be defined.

0033753864	T cell lymphoproliferative disorder following bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anemia	Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is uncommonly of T cell origin, especially following BMT. We describe a 13-year-old boy with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and no evidence of Fanconi's anemia who underwent BMT at 11 years of age using CY 10 mg/kg once daily i.v. on days -5, -4, antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) 30 mg/kg once daily i.v. on days -5~-3 and CsA from day -1 as conditioning. The BMT failed and he received a further peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) 240 days after BMT. Conditioning was with CY 50 mg/kg once daily i.v. on days -5~-2, and ALG 15 mg/kg once daily i.v. on days -4~-2. GVHD prophylaxis included CsA and MTX. Engraftment was later confirmed by cytogenetic studies. Desquamation and ulcers of the oral mucosa and mouth angle developed in the 13th month post PBSCT. A buccal mucosa biopsy on day +524 revealed only plasmacytosis. Immunosuppressants were discontinued at that point. Generalized lymphadenopathy, prolonged fever (waxing and waning) and facial swelling developed in the 18th month post PBSCT. A neck lymph node biopsy on day +601 showed T cell lymphoma of diffuse large cell type with monoclonal TCR γ-chain gene rearrangement. A FISH study showed that the malignant T cells were of recipient origin. EBV in situ hybridization was negative. He did not receive further treatment apart from discontinuation of immunosuppressants. He was followed up in our out-patient clinic and showed good performance 1170 days post PBSCT. We speculate that a different mechanism was operating in the pathogenesis of T cell lymphoma in this case. Risk factors include SAA and two transplants, conditioned with CY and ALG, long term use of CsA and treatment with azathioprine.

0034095649	Mitochondrial cytopathy combined with Fanconi's syndrome	Severe muscle weakness in Fanconi's syndrome is rarely the result of mitochondrial cytopathy. We describe a rare case of a 9-year-old male with early onset of Fanconi's syndrome. He developed severe proximal muscle weakness exacerbated by hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia in childhood. The muscle biopsy revealed increased accumulation of abnormal mitochondria and fat droplets in histochemical stains and electron microscopy. Mitochondrial cytopathy cannot be excluded in Fanconi's syndrome with late onset of muscular impairment. Long-term follow-up of his clinical course is suggested to understand the natural history of this unusual case. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

38849193398	Ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis reduced the risk of asthma and allergen sensitization	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in early life is a risk factor for later development of asthma and atopy. Ribavirin is the only effective drug currently available against acute RSV bronchiolitis. However, the long-term effects of ribavirin remain unclear. We investigated a cohort of children hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis from when they were under 2 yr old until they reached a mean age of 6.2 yr. In total, we enrolled 175 children in this study. Both the group treated with ribavirin and the group not treated with ribavirin included high-risk young children with congenital heart disease or chronic lung disease. Their respective age-matched controls, that we labeled groups A and B, both without ribavirin treatment, consisted of previously healthy subjects. Wheezing was either verified by physicians or estimated by a questionnaire. Allergen sensitization was judged by serum allergen-specific IgE levels. The cumulative incidence of physician-diagnosed asthma or recurrent wheezing in the ribavirin group (15%) was significantly lower than its incidence in the non-ribavirin-treated group (34%, p = 0.049), and in the control A group (43%, p = 0.005). Allergen sensitization was also least frequent in the ribavirin group. Ribavirin therapy was an independent factor in reducing the risk of developing asthma, asthma/recurrent wheezing, and sensitization to D. pteronyssinus/D. farinae.

77954674277	Clinical course and outcome of children with status asthmaticus treated in a pediatric intensive care unit: A 15-year review	Background and purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical course and outcomes of children with status asthmaticus treated in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in Taiwan. Methods: The medical charts of all patients aged from 2 to 18 years with status asthmaticus who were admitted to the PICU National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, from 1990 to 2006 were reviewed retrospectively. Results: Twenty eight children were admitted on 33 occasions; 4 patients had more than 1 admission. The mean age was 6.23 years (range, 2-17 years). No control medication was regularly used prior to admission for 81.8% of the episodes. The mean PICU stay was 2.55 days (range, 1-13 days) and, for 78.8% of episodes, the patients were discharged from the ICU within 2 days. For 11 episodes (33.3%), the patients required mechanical ventilation for a mean duration of 3.6 days. The mortality rate was 3.3% (n = 1). Complications included bronchopneumonia (57.6%), hemodynamic compromise (9.1%), neurologic symptoms (6.1%), and air leak (3.3%). Patients requiring mechanical ventilation had significantly lower initial pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (<90%), lower blood gas pH (<7.25), higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and longer duration of PICU and hospital stay (p < 0.05) when compared with patients not requiring mechanical ventilation. For patients with a history of repeated PICU admissions for asthma, the intubation rate was 77.7%. Conclusions: The prognosis for childhood status asthmaticus is favorable. The most common trigger factors were respiratory tract infection and poor asthma control. © 2009 Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection.

84867089675	Identification and characterization of IgA antibodies against β2-glycoprotein i in childhood Henoch-Schönlein purpura	Background Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a common IgA-mediated vasculitis in children. The antigenic target for IgA is to be determined. Objective To test whether β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) is an antigenic target for IgA in childhood HSP, and to evaluate the clinical implications and pathogenic role of such IgA autoantibodies. Methods The reactivity of patients' plasma samples and purified polyclonal IgA with β2GPI, β2GPI-derived peptides and endothelial cells was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The association between clinical manifestations and IgA anti-β2GPI antibodies was also analysed. Finally, IgA-mediated cytotoxicity on endothelial cells was further evaluated. Results At the acute stage, patients with HSP had significantly higher plasma levels of IgA antibodies against β2GPI than healthy controls [reference units (RU) 1·14 ± 0·8 vs. 0·42 ± 0·24, P < 0·001]. IgA anti-β2GPI antibodies were associated with the presence of joint manifestations (with vs. without joint involvement, 1·15 ± 0·64 vs. 0·85 ± 0·47, P = 0·0341) and heavy proteinuria (with vs. without heavy proteinuria, 2·09 ± 2·02 vs. 1·04 ± 0·62, P = 0·0028). Polyclonal IgA from plasma samples positive for IgA anti-β2GPI antibodies bound well not only to β2GPI with Kd values < 10

84897023383	Analysis of α-lactalbumin-, β-lactoglobulin-, and casein-specific IgE among children with atopic diseases in a tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan	Background: Cow's milk allergy is the first manifestation of the allergic march, because cow's milk proteins are the first foreign proteins consumed in large quantities by infants. The aim of this study was to determine which of these proteins causes the greatest sensitization in Taiwanese individuals, and its correlation with atopic patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of atopic patients who were treated at the National Taiwan University Hospital from January 2009 to March 2011. A total of 190 patients were enrolled and tested for isolated cow's milk protein (α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, and casein) sensitization. These patients were further divided into atopic dermatitis and non-atopic dermatitis subgroups, and also grouped by age. Differences in sensitization to cow's milk proteins between groups were analyzed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test. Results: The sensitization rate to α-lactalbumin-specific IgE was 60%, followed by β-lactoglobulin (46.84%) and casein (40.53%). The levels of specific IgE antibodies against α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, and casein were higher in patients with atopic dermatitis (1.8, 1.19, 0.95 vs. 0.77, 0.55, 0.40kUA/L). The younger age group had higher mean specific IgE antibodies against cow's milk proteins than the older age groups. Conclusion: There was a different distribution of cow's milk protein sensitization in Taiwanese patients in our study, with α-lactalbumin being most common as compared to casein in Western countries. Among the patients with cow's milk sensitization, the atopic dermatitis group had significantly higher cow's milk protein-specific IgE antibodies as compared to the non-atopic dermatitis group. © 2012.

4444341831	Retrospective analysis of the renal outcome of pediatric lupus nephritis	The aim of this study was to analyze the renal outcome of pediatric lupus nephritis in the past two decades. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who fulfilled the 1987 American Rheumatism Association revised criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus who were followed up at the National Taiwan University Hospital between 1980 and 2001. All new patients who were under 18 years of age at the time of diagnosis were enrolled and were followed up until death, loss to follow-up, or till the end of 2002. The response to the treatment and renal outcome were analyzed. Seventy-two children (64 girls and 8 boys) were enrolled in the study. The mean age at diagnosis was 13.93 ± 0.35 years (mean ± SEM). The mean duration of follow-up was 7.12 ± 0.51 years. The 5-year renal survival rate (survival without dialysis or transplantation) was 63.13% and the 10-year survival rate was 53.54%. It was significantly better in patients receiving cyclophosphamide (CYC) pulse therapy. The 5-year survival rate for these patients was 87.82% and the 10-year survival rate was 81.06%. The renal survival curve was better in the CYC pulse therapy group than in the no CYC pulse therapy group, with p = 0.0022. The duration between the diagnosis of lupus nephritis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was significantly longer in the CYC group (9.66 ± 1.32 yrs) than in the no CYC group (3.24 ± 0.94 yers), p = 0.036. In the multivariate analysis, risk factors of developing ESRD were failure to achieve complete remission, higher serum creatinine at the initiation of treatment, and not receiving CYC pulse therapy. The renal survival was significantly better in the CYC pulse therapy group. The CYC pulse therapy was recommended in pediatric lupus nephritis patients and every effort should be made to achieve complete remission. © Clinical Rheumatology 2004.

45049088729	Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with severe cardiac involvement in an infant: A case report	Severe visceral involvement in leukocytoclastic vasculitis is rare. We report here the case of a 2-month-old male infant with leukocytoclastic vasculitis who initially presented with fever and skin purpura. Endomyocarditis with mitral valve regurgitation, multiple hepatic infarction, and pulmonary hemorrhage developed later. The patient was successfully managed with an aggressive treatment of high frequency oscillation ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation together with corticosteroid and azathioprine therapy for 3 months. Valvuloplasty was also performed due to irreversible damage of the mitral valve, although long-term oral anticongestive medications were also needed. © Clinical Rheumatology 2008.

61549119156	Quantitative assessment of allergic shiners in children with allergic rhinitis	Background: The knowledge on allergic shiners is extremely limited. A conceivable tool able to quantify allergic shiners has not been established. Objectives: We sought to determine the significance and changeability of allergic shiners through our newly developed computerized method. Methods: We developed a novel computerized method to measure allergic shiners and enrolled a cohort of children with or without allergic rhinitis. Children with allergic rhinitis were prospectively assessed. A standardized digital photograph was taken during each visit, and a modified Pediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire was completed. Subject global assessment for nose symptoms and subject global assessment for eye symptoms (SGAE) were self-recorded daily. Results: We included 126 children with allergic rhinitis and 123 healthy control subjects. One hundred three (82%) participants with allergic rhinitis completed at least 4 prospective assessments. Shiners were darker (P < .001) and larger (P < .001) in children with allergic rhinitis. Darkness and sizes of allergic shiners were paradoxically inversely correlated (P = .02). Darkness of allergic shiners positively correlated with the duration of allergic rhinitis, practical problem scores, and SGAE values (P = .02, P = .004, and P = .002, respectively), but sizes of allergic shiners did not. Shiners were found to be darker in children with scores of eye symptoms of greater than 6, scores of practical problems of greater than 5, and SGAE values of greater than 0 (P = .02, P < .001, and P = .003, respectively), whereas shiners were larger in children with scores of other symptoms of greater than 9 and activity limitations of greater than 4 (P = .02 and P = .002, respectively). Conclusion: Computer-analyzed allergic shiners correlate with the chronicity and severity of allergic rhinitis. © 2009 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

68949211250	The effect of caffeic acid phenethyl ester on the functions of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells	Background: Propolis, an ancient herbal medicine, has been reported the beneficial effect both in asthma patients and murine model of asthma, but the mechanism was not clearly understood. In this study, the effect of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), the most extensively studied components in propolis, on the functions of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) was investigated. Results: CAPE significantly inhibited IL-12 p40, IL-12 p70, IL-10 protein expression in mature healthy human MoDCs stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and IL-12 p40, IL-10, IP-10 stimulated by crude mite extract. CAPE significantly inhibited IL-10 and IP-10 but not IL-12 expression in allergic patients' MoDCs stimulated by crude mite extract. In contrast, the upregulation of costimulatory molecules in mature MoDCs was not suppressed by CAPE. Further, the antigen presenting ability of DCs was not inhibited by CAPE. CAPE inhibited IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activation but not mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family phosphorylation in human MoDCs. Conclusion: These results indicated that CAPE inhibited cytokine and chemokine production by MoDCs which might be related to the NF-κB signaling pathway. This study provided a new insight into the mechanism of CAPE in immune response and the rationale for propolis in the treatment of asthma and other allergic disorders. © 2009 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

70349330775	Clinical Manifestations and Outcomes of Henoch-Schönlein Purpura: Comparison between Adults and Children	Background: Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) primarily affects children, but age at onset is thought to be important in determining disease severity and outcome. This study compared the clinical and laboratory data from children and adults with HSP. Methods: This retrospective 5-year study enrolled 65 children and 22 adult HSP patients attending a medical center. Results: Gross hematuria and lower-extremity edema were significantly more frequent in adults (p < 0.05). All the children developed renal involvement within 2 weeks, while 67% of the adult patients developed hematuria by the fifth week of disease onset. Elevated white blood cell count and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly more common in children (p < 0.05). Adults had a higher frequency of renal involvement (p < 0.05), though this was also present in 14 children (21.54%), 12 with isolated hematuria and proteinuria and two with nephrotic syndrome. All the children maintained normal renal function. Twelve adults had renal involvement (52.6%), six with progression to renal insufficiency. Patients with abdominal pain at disease onset had a significantly higher probability of developing nephrotic syndrome (p < 0.05). Logistic regression revealed that age > 20 years, male, bloody stools, clinical course with relapse of purpuric rash, and persistent rash for > 1 month were poor prognostic indicators for HSP nephritis (p < 0.05). Conclusions: HSP nephritis in adults had a higher risk of progression to renal insufficiency. More aggressive treatment and extended follow-up with repeated urinalysis for at least 6 weeks were often necessary, especially in older patients. © 2009 Taiwan Pediatric Association.

7244227814	Sera from children with active Henoch-Schönlein purpura can enhance the production of interleukin 8 by human umbilical venous endothelial cells	Objective: To investigate the ability of sera from children with active Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) to enhance endothelial interleukin (IL) 8 production and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression. Methods: Nine children with active HSP and nine normal healthy children were enrolled. IL8 serum levels of patients and controls at different stages were analysed. Production of IL8 and expression of ICAM-1 by human umbilical venous endothelial cells were detected (ELISA for IL8, flow cytometry for ICAM-1) and compared under various stimuli, including sera of patients at different stages, sera of controls, and medium alone. Results: Serum levels of IL8 were increased at the acute stage. Levels of, IL8 in supernatants from human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) co-cultured with sera from children with active HSP were significantly higher than those from HUVEC without any treatment (p=0.001), HUVEC treated with inactive sera (p=0.004), and HUVEC treated with sera from healthy controls (p=0.004). Sera from patients and from controls did not enhance the expression of ICAM-1 on HUVEC. Conclusions: Some factors may be present in sera from children with active HSP that could activate endothelial cells to produce IL8. This process may account, in part, for the mechanisms of perivascular neutrophil infiltration and leucocytosis in HSP.

72949120213	Fifteen-year experience of pediatric-onset mixed connective tissue disease	The aim of this study was to investigate the initial clinical manifestations, laboratory data, complications, and outcomes of patients with pediatric-onset mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) in Taiwan. We reviewed medical charts of patients younger than 18 years with a diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease based on the criteria of Kasukawa (1) at the pediatric department of National Taiwan University Hospital from 1993 to 2008. A total of 12 patients were included. All of the patients were female. The mean age at disease onset was 10.7 years (range 6.5 to 14 years). The most common symptoms at disease onset were polyarthritis (7/12 patients) and Raynaud's phenomenon (7/12 patients). The clinical symptoms changed with time, and other symptoms encompassing the criteria for MCTD developed sequentially. Inflammatory manifestations (arthritis, fever, and skin rash) improved following treatment, whereas sclerodermatous features (sclerodactyly, esophageal disease, and vasculopathy) persisted and were often unresponsive to therapy. The organ involvement-free rates at 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years were 91.7%, 78.6%, and 52.4%, respectively. In this retrospective study, sclerodermatous changes of internal organs were a poor prognostic factor in our population, and we emphasize that long-term follow-up is necessary, and appropriate treatment should be applied to improve the outcomes. © 2009 Clinical Rheumatology.

77951851869	Nutritional Status and Clinical Characteristics in Children With Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis	Background/Purpose: The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and nutritional status of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) in Taiwanese children. Methods: Fifty-three patients were included in this study. The disease subtype and patient characteristics were recorded. Body mass index (BMI) was determined. Seventy-five healthy age-matched children served as a control group. Results: The inflammation parameters, including white blood cell count, platelet count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, were elevated in the systemic group. The BMI level of the JRA group was significantly lower than the control group (p = 0.006), especially in the male patients (p = 0.016) and when the patient age was greater than 4 (p = 0.011). The patients with oligoarticular onset JRA had significantly lower BMI compared with the healthy control group (p = 0.012). Conclusion: Nutritional status is often impaired in patients with JRA. The BMI of the JRA patients was lower than that of age-matched healthy children, especially in the male group, and when disease onset age was greater than 4. In our unselected sample, the most affected disease subtype was oligoarticular onset JRA. © 2010 Taiwan Society of Microbiology.

77954877859	Analysis of the serum levels of fungi-specific immunoglobulin e in patients with allergic diseases	Background: Atopic patients are exceptionally sensitive to airborne allergens. Sensitization to fungal allergens may be associated with respiratory allergic disease (RAD) and atopic dermatitis (AD). This study investigates the relationship between sensitization to different fungal allergens and the clinical manifestations of atopic disease. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of atopic patients from the National Taiwan University Hospital from 2004 to 2009. A total of 133 atopic patients were found who were sensitive to at least 1 of the 3 most common fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium chrysogenum) in Taiwan and were enrolled in the study. These patients were further divided into subgroups of isolated AD, isolated RAD and AD + RAD. The association between sensitization to fungi and allergic disease was analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Results: The sensitization rate to Candida-specific IgE was 81.2%, followed closely by Aspergillus at 69.2% and Penicillium at 63.2%. Isolated AD was the most common diagnosis. The levels of specific IgE antibodies against Aspergillus, Candida and Penicillium were highest in patients with isolated AD. Logistic regression revealed that isolated AD was highly associated with sensitization to Candida [odds ratio (OR) 10.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.37-45.9]. In contrast, sensitization to Penicillium (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.87)and Candida (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.92) showed a negative association with isolated RAD. Conclusions: Fungal sensitization is more closely associated with AD than RAD. Our results suggest that specific sensitization to fungal allergensplays a critical role in the pathogenesis of atopic disease. © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.

77955366373	Type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI) as potential new therapeutic target for bronchial asthma	The IL-1R/TLR family has been receiving considerable attention as potential regulators of inflammation through their ability to act as either activators or suppressors of inflammation. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness, allergic inflammation, elevated serum total, allergen-specific IgE levels, and increased Th2 cytokine production. The discovery that the IL-1RIIL-1 and ST2IL-33 pathways are crucial for allergic inflammation has raised interest in these receptors as potential targets for developing new therapeutic strategies for bronchial asthma. This paper discusses the current use of neutralizing mAb or soluble receptor constructs to deplete cytokines, the use of neutralizing mAb or recombinant receptor antagonists to block cytokine receptors, and gene therapy from experimental studies in asthma. Targeting IL-1RIIL-1 as well as ST2IL-33 pathways may promise a disease-modifying approach in the future. Copyright © 2010 Jyh-Hong Lee et al.

78650375250	Hepatitis B virus surface antigen can activate dendritic cells and modulate T helper type immune response	Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) is a major antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Dendritic cells (DC) of HBV carriers have been reported to exhibit functional impairment. In this study, the role of HBsAg on mice bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and immune responses in vivo was studied. The immune modulatory function of HBsAg was explored by using mice bone marrow-derived dendritic cells in vitro and also by examining an ovalbumin (OVA) specific immune response in vivo. Treatment of dendritic cells with HBsAg resulted in enhanced cell surface expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) 80, CD83, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, and enhanced production of interleukin (IL)-12 p40 and IL-12 p70. Treatment of dendritic cells with HBsAg resulted in decreased T cell secretion of IL-5 by OVA stimulation. In addition, the results showed stronger OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M and weaker IgG responses in mice sera when they had been immunized with OVA and co-injected with HBsAg. It was also found that the mice exhibited significant enhancement of anti-OVA IgG2a antibody (Ab), as well as marked inhibition of IgG1 Ab production. In cellular immune responses, IL-5 production was significantly decreased and interferon (IFN)-γ increased in the group co-injected with HBsAg. On the other hand, the induction of lymphoproliferative response to OVA stimulation in spleen cells was decreased in the HBsAg co-injected group. These results demonstrate that HBsAg can affect the differentiation of T helper (Th) cells, which might provide a strategy for improving its prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy. © 2010 The Societies and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

79955117080	The initial manifestations and final diagnosis of patients with high and low titers of antinuclear antibodies after 6 months of follow-up	Background: The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is the most commonly used test to screen for autoimmune diseases. However, only a limited numbers of studies have addressed the characteristics of patients positive for ANA. In this study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between initial presentations, ANA titer, and final diagnoses. Methods: Patients who visited National Taiwan University Hospital and received a first ANA test were enrolled and then followed for a further 6 months. The symptoms and signs at the time of ANA testing, ANA titers, and the final diagnoses were recorded and analyzed. Results: A total of 355 patients were positive for ANA. Joint pain was the most common initial presentation at the time of ANA testing. Compared with the patients with low ANA titers (<1:640), those with high ANA titers (≥1:640) were more susceptible to autoimmune diseases. More importantly, of the patients with initial presentations of joint pain, fever, abnormal urinalysis, or skin rash/skin tightness, autoimmune diseases were more frequently diagnosed in those with high ANA titers than with low ANA titers (p<0.05). In addition, both anti-double strand DNA antibodies and anti-extractable nuclear antibodies were more commonly detected in patients with high ANA titers. Conclusions: A high ANA titer seems to be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases, especially for patients presenting with joint pain, fever, abnormal urinalysis, or skin rash/skin tightness. © 2011.

79953324918	Association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in FOXP3 gene with systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility: A case-control study	Foxp3, encoded by the human FOXP3 gene, is a transcription factor that regulates regulatory T-cell (Treg) development and function. Associations have been reported between FOXP3 gene variants and autoimmune endocrinopathy and non-endocrine autoimmune disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the FOXP3 gene on genetic predisposition to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The study cohort comprised 172 SLE patients and 181 controls, who were genotyped for the FOXP3 gene variants. Of five SNPs identified, the FOXP3 -6054 ATT carrier was shown to be associated with renal disorder (odds ratio [OR] 3.26, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.33-8.03, p = 0.0077). Furthermore, lower anti-dsDNA levels were found in patients with the -3279 A carrier (p = 0.0109). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the association of FOXP3 SNPs with susceptibility to SLE, as well as sub-phenotype susceptibility. Although the exact role of Foxp3 and FOXP3 gene variations in SLE is still not clear, the present data support the importance of variations in the FOXP3 gene region for the etiology of certain manifestations of SLE. © The Author(s), 2010.

80054887607	Genetics and immunopathogenesis of IgA nephropathy	IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common glomerulonephritis in the world. The hallmark of IgAN is underglycosylation in the hinge region of IgA1. Increasing evidence supports the underglycosylated IgA-containing immune-complex including IgG antibodies against the glycans of the hinge region of IgA1 are key factors for mesangial deposition and then trigger inflammation and glomerular injury. The polymeric IgA is produced after aberrant mucosal IgA response. The displacement of mucosal B cells to systemic lymphoid organs and bone marrow may arise from abnormal trafficking of lymphocytes along the mucosa-bone marrow axis involving changes of chemokines and adhesion molecules. This review will summarize the works on the genetics, the mucosal and systemic IgA immune response, mechanism of underglycosylation of IgA1, and the pathological effect of mesangial IgA deposition in IgAN. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84856260354	Kawasaki disease and Henoch-Schönlein purpura - 10 years' experience of childhood vasculitis at a university hospital in Taiwan	Background/Purpose: To investigate the clinical manifestations, disease activity and prognosis in different types of vasculitis. Methods: The charts of pediatric patients with vasculitis diagnosed from December 1997 to December 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. The first clinical manifestations and laboratory results were recorded at the time of diagnosis, and outcome evaluations with history of flare-ups were analyzed. Results: A total of 508 vasculitis patients were included in this study, of whom 124 had Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), and 351 had Kawasaki disease (KD). Hematuria was observed in 79% of recurrent HSP patients at the time of diagnosis, and was associated with an increased risk of relapse (p=0.000). In Kawasaki disease, the clinical symptoms with erythematous changes in Bacille Calmette-Guérin scars and coronary artery dilatation were more prominent in patients younger than 1 year old, and lymphadenopathy was more common in patients older than 1 year old (p=0.001). The risk of coronary dilatation was significant in the patients with an initial presentation of thrombocytosis, and greater in patients younger than 1 year old (p=0.027). Thrombocytopenia was more prominent in vasculitis-associated autoimmune diseases. Marked lymphocytosis with increased C-reactive protein levels was significantly noted in urticarial vasculitis patients compared with HSP patients in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: Vasculitis disease activity and prognosis were associated with initial laboratory results and clinical manifestations. Further large-scale clinical trials are warranted to validate these findings. © 2011.

84862830182	Clinical manifestations and outcomes of pediatric chronic neutropenia	Background/Purpose: Neutropenia is a decrease in the number of circulating neutrophils. When neutropenia persists for more than 3 months, it becomes chronic. A heterogeneous group of diseases in children can cause chronic neutropenia. The aim of the present study was to categorize the diseases and present their clinical manifestations, treatment, and outcomes. Methods: Medical charts of patients with pediatric chronic neutropenia from the last 21 years (1988-2008) were reviewed in a tertiary referral center. Results: Twenty-nine patients were documented during the study period: seven with congenital neutropenia syndromes (CNSs), seven with autoimmune neutropenia (AIN), and 15 with chronic idiopathic neutropenia (CIN). Three CNS patients had severe chronic neutropenia, one had the Chediak-Higashi syndrome, one had the hyper-IgM syndrome, one had the glycogen storage disease type Ib, and one had the Barth syndrome. CNS patients had severe neutropenia early with frequent infections causing high morbidity and mortality. CNS patients usually required prophylactic antibiotics, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapies, or umbilical cord blood transplantations to improve or correct clinical conditions. However, most AIN and CIN patients later recovered spontaneously and did not require granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapy. The mean absolute neutrophil count at onset, the mean onset age of neutropenia, and the mean duration of neutropenia of the two groups of patients did not significantly differ. Some AIN patients had anemia, and some CIN patients had anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Conclusion: It is difficult and risky to draw any conclusion from such a small-scale study; however, we believe that promptly diagnosing underlying diseases and administering appropriate disease-oriented therapy would be crucial for the treatment of patients with chronic neutropenia, particularly with regard to CNSs. © 2012.

84865986803	Clinical analysis of macrophage activation syndrome in pediatric patients with autoimmune diseases	Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) belongs to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) syndrome. It is usually associated with rheumatic diseases. We retrospectively reviewed our hospital's medical records of 102 HLH/MAS patients from the past 20 years. Demographics, clinical data, treatment, and outcomes were analyzed. Among 102 patients, eight patients with underlying juvenile systemic lupus erythematous (two patients), mixed connective tissue disease (one patient), primary antiphospholipid syndrome (one patient), and systemic type juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (sJRA; four patients) with 13 episodes of MAS were studied. Clinical manifestations of MAS included fever (100 %), hepatosplenomegaly (77 %), lymphadenopathy (38 %), skin rash (62 %), and neurological involvement (31 %). Laboratory features included leukopenia (54 %), anemia (46 %), thrombocytopenia (77 %), jaundice (27 %), hypofibrinogenemia (40 %), decreased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (67 %), and elevated liver enzymes (77 %), lactate dehydrogenase (100 %), ferritin (88 %), triglycerides (91 %), C-reactive protein (85 %), plasma D-dimer (50 %), and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow (83 %). The Epstein-Barr virus and adenovirus infection triggered MAS in two patients with sJRA. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy was effective in two out of three patients, and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was effective in two out of six patients. Patients with sJRA responded well to corticosteroids and cyclosporine. Complications included opportunistic infection with Pneumocystis jiroveci, multiple organ failure, and intensive care unit myopathy. The mortality rate was one out of eight (12.5 %). Our results showed that MAS could be fatal and complicate various pediatric autoimmune diseases. It generally has a good response to corticosteroids and IVIG. Prompt recognition and timely treatment can result in good outcomes. © Clinical Rheumatology 2012.

84867897397	Initial manifestations and clinical course of systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis: A ten-year retrospective study	Background/Purpose: The diagnosis of systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA) on disease onset is challenging and made mainly by exclusion. This study aimed to investigate the initial clinical and laboratory features of children with SoJIA in Taiwan. Methods: Patients diagnosed with SoJIA at the National Taiwan University Hospital between 1997 and 2007 were evaluated and data were collected by retrospective chart review. Inferential statistics were used to compare features of patients with steroid use for <6 months or >6 months. Results: Twenty-eight (28) patients (13 boys and 15 girls) were included in this study. The mean age of onset was 8.7 years old. The most common presentations were fever (100%), arthritis (89.3%), and skin rash (67.9%). The patterns of arthritis in affected patients were 50% oligoarticular type and 39% polyarticular type. The most common joints involved were the knee (76% of patients with arthritis), ankle (56%), and elbow and proximal interphalangeal joints (28%). The most common pattern of fever during first week was intermittent (53%). Prolonged use of steroid was associated with leukocytosis (17.63±7.71 vs. 11.93±4.43×10

84871607477	Association between human IL-10 gene polymorphisms and serum IL-10 level in patients with food allergy	Background/Purpose: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene are associated with allergic diseases in different populations. This study aimed to determine the distribution of two SNPs at -1082A/G and -592A/C (rs1800896 and rs1800872, respectively) in the IL-10 gene promoter of Taiwanese food allergy (FA) patients, and also to compare the serum IL-10 levels between patients with (FA) and controls. Methods: Thirty-seven patients with FA and 52 controls were enrolled, and their peripheral blood was collected for IL-10 SNP genotyping and the corresponding serum IL-10 level of each genotype. Results: The thirty-seven FA patients had positive food-specific IgE (≥ 0.75. kU/L) to more than one food, and the most frequent allergens wereshrimp and crab (56.8% and 35.1%, respectively). The genotype distributions in the FA patients compared to the control group were AA and AG at -1082A/G (86.5% and 13.5% vs. 86.6% and 13.4%, respectively), and AA, AC, and CC at -592A/C (45.9%, 43.3% and 10.8% vs. 38.5%, 48.1% and 13.4%, respectively). Serum IL-10 levels were significantly lower in the FA group than in the control group (p= 0.0187), and the IL-10 level of -592A/C of genotype AA was significantly lower than that of the other genotypes (AC+CC) (p= 0.007). Patients with AA/AA haplotype homozygotes (10 of 24) had significantly lower serum IL-10 levels than those with other haplotypes. Conclusions: The two SNPs at -1082A/G and -592A/C of IL-10 were associated with FA in our Taiwanese population, and FA patients with the genotype AA/AA haplotype homozygotes had lower serum IL-10 levels. This suggests that IL-10 might play a critical role in the pathogenesis of FA. We suggest that it may be practicable to evaluate the serum IL-10 levels of FA patients and to predict the possibility of FA if genotypes and haplotypes are checked regularly. © 2012 .

84872604372	Analysis of serum total IgE, specific IgE and eosinophils in children with acute and chronic urticaria	Background/Purpose: Increased IgE and eosinophil levels are frequently observed in cutaneous inflammation and are thought to provoke the occurrence of urticaria. However, the relationship of these factors with the disease duration of urticaria remains unclear. The aim of this study was to compare serum total IgE levels, specific IgE sensitization rates and eosinophil percentages between acute and chronic urticaria in children. Methods: A total of 165 patients (104 with acute and 61 with chronic urticaria) from a tertiary referral hospital were enrolled in this study. Serum levels of total IgE, prevalence of sensitization to food and aeroallergens and blood eosinophil percentages were compared by the disease duration of urticaria. Results: There were no statistical differences in total IgE production, positive sensitization to specific allergens and eosinophil percentages between the patients with acute and chronic urticaria. There is a higher prevalence of sensitization to aeroallergens than food allergens in children with urticaria. In terms of gender, males had significantly higher serum IgE levels than females. Conclusion: Boys potentially have a higher serum IgE expression than girls children with urticaria. IgE levels and eosinophil percentages are not good indicators for a prolonged course of urticaria. The prevalence of sensitization to aeroallergens was significantly higher than that of food allergens in children with urticaria. Routine laboratory analysis for common allergens is not appropriate, and it could be a feasible approach to detect a predilection for atopy when respiratory infections are causative factors of urticaria occurrence. © 2011.

84880767054	A nationwide survey of the severity, comorbidity, and mortality of hospitalized patients with asthma in taiwan	Objective: To clarify the epidemiology of asthma admission in a nationwide survey, we analyze the characteristics of hospitalized patients in Taiwan. Methods: Data regarding asthma-associated hospitalizations were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan from January 2001 to December 2002. Patient characteristics in terms of severity, mortality, and cost were stratified by age, gender, and presence of comorbidities. Results: A total of 59,983 hospitalizations with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code 493.xx and asthma-related treatment were included in the current analysis. When stratified by age, the number and duration of hospitalizations were distributed in J-shape distribution, with the nadir located in the range of 8-18 years of age. The severity of asthma was found to increase with age (p < 0.001) and was more severe in men compared with women (p < 0.001). The severity of in-hospital patients was significantly greater in subjects with underlying respiratory disease compared to patients with other comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and infectious disease. The mortality rates of all hospitalized asthma patients and pediatric hospitalized asthma patients were 0.77% and 0.02%, respectively. The risk factor for mortality of asthma was older age and male gender in multiple regression. Conclusion: The severity of asthma increased after 18 years of age. Increased comorbidities in elderly patients might contribute to asthma severity. The mortality rate was low in pediatric patients and significantly increased in males and the elderly. The above findings suggest that additional effort is required in the treatment of elderly and male asthmatic patients. © 2012, Taiwan Pediatric Association. Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC.

84880967556	Young children with behçet disease have more intestinal involvement	OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in childhood Behçet disease (BD) is not well understood. We aimed to clarify the intestinal presentation in children with BD. METHODS: Medical records of 85 children with recurrent oral ulcers between 1990 and 2010 at the National Taiwan University Hospital were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty of them who fulfilled the Mason and Barnes criteria for the diagnosis of childhood BD were enrolled. The clinical and laboratory characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 20 patients, the median age at diagnosis was 13.2 years. The common presentations included oral ulcers (100%), genital ulcers (70%), skin lesions (65%), and GI symptoms (50%). Five of 10 patients with GI symptoms received endoscopic examinations and all had ulcers. Divided by the age of 10, patients younger than 10 years tended to have higher rates of GI symptoms initially and intestinal ulcers (P = 0.002 and 0.015, respectively). Platelet count was significantly lower in young patients (P = 0.0151). Patients without GI symptoms had higher rates of skin involvement than patients with GI symptoms (P = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Young children with BD tended to have more GI presentations. For children with BD younger than 10 years having GI symptoms, endoscopic examinations may be considered.

84881085029	Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis-Associated Uveitis: A Nationwide Population-Based Study in Taiwan	Objective:The incidence and prevalence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) vary widely across the world but data in East Asia is lacking. Uveitis is a serious cause of morbidity in JIA. This study aimed to analyze the incidence and prevalence of JIA, and the characteristics of JIA-associated uveitis in Taiwan.Methods:A population-based cohort study was conducted using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Each patient was individually tracked from 1999 to 2009 to identify the diagnosis of JIA and uveitis using the International Classification of Diseases diagnostic codes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors and complications of uveitis in patients with JIA.Results:The study cohort had 2636 cases of JIA and included juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (57.7%), enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) (39.2%), and psoriatic arthritis (3.1%). The average annual incidence of JIA and JIA-associated uveitis were 4.93 (range, 3.93-6.23) and 0.25 (range, 0.12-0.37) cases per 100,000 population, respectively. The average period prevalence of JIA was 33.8 cases per 100,000 population. Uveitis occurred in 4.7% of patients with JIA, while JIA-associated uveitis was complicated by cataract (11.2%) and glaucoma (24.8%). Enthesitis-related arthritis was significantly associated with uveitis (OR: 3.47; 95% CI: 2.24-5.37) (p<0.0001). Uveitis diagnosed before JIA was the most significant risk factor for complications of glaucoma or cataract (OR: 3.54; 95% CI: 1.44-8.72) (p = 0.006).Conclusions:The incidence of JIA is low but that of JIA-associated uveitis is increasing. Higher percentage of males in patients with ERA and the strong association between ERA and uveitis are unique for children with JIA in Taiwan. Uveitis diagnosed before arthritis is an important risk factor for complications. Continuous ophthalmologic follow-up is needed for children with JIA or uveitis of unknown etiology. © 2013 Yu et al.

84886605099	Acute myocarditis and ventricular fibrillation as initial presentation of pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus	Acute myocarditis and ventricular arrhythmia are rarely seen as the initial presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in children. We reported the case of a 12-year-old girl with congestive heart failure, acute myocarditis and pericardial effusion as a primary manifestation of SLE. Sudden cardiovascular collapse due to ventricular fibrillation (VF), ventricular tachycardia (VT) and cardiac tamponade occurred. After resuscitation and pericardiocentesis, frequent VF/VT refractory to anti-arrhythmic therapy was supported by venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Early diagnosis and a combination treatment for heart failure, arrhythmias and immunosuppression may result in a favorable outcome. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

0142011504	Retrospective analysis of mortality and morbidity of pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus in the past two decades	A total of 153 pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus patients (131 girls and 22 boys) under 18 years of age who were newly diagnosed between 1980 and 2001 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were followed up until death, loss of follow-up, or December 31, 2002. The mean follow-up duration was 6.11 ± 9.02 years. There were no differences in sex and family history between the 1980-to-1990 cohort and the 1991-to-2001 cohort. The rate of complications of infection, skeletal manifestation, and end-stage renal disease were significantly higher in the 1980-to-1990 cohort (p=0.007, 0.001, and 0.000, respectively). Infection was the leading cause of death, and there were no differences in the cause of death between the 2 cohorts except end-stage renal disease (p=0.005). The survival rate was significantly worse in the 1980-to-1990 cohort than in the 1991-to-2001 cohort (p=-0.0012). The 2 significant poor prognostic factors were being female and the development of end-stage renal disease. We conclude that the mortality and morbidity of SLE has improved over the past 2 decades. It may be associated with newer treatment modalities and better supportive care available recently.

0346394264	Methimazole-induced lupus erythematosus: A case report	A 15-year-old girl had a history of diffuse goiter and received methimazole treatment 2 months before admission to the hospital. She developed bilateral lower leg edema 5 days before admission and the laboratory examinations revealed leukopenia, anemia, proteinuria, and granular cast. Positive antinuclear antibodies and anti-double strand (anti-ds) DNA antibodies were noted, although complement levels were not reduced, Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody was positive, A renal biopsy disclosed that there was focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Methimazole was discontinued, and she was treated with prednisolone and Plaquenil, after which the symptoms and laboratory tests became normal within 40 days. The prednisolone was discontinued after treatment for seven months. Currently, the anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, CBC, urinalysis, and thyroid function tests are within normal limits. With hydroxychloroquine and levothyroxine, she was free of symptoms after discontinuation of methimazole until new (about 21 months).

84904807377	Clinical characteristics of children with positive anti-SSA/SSB antibodies	This study aimed to characterize the manifestations of clinical symptoms and signs, primary rheumatic diseases, and other autoantibodies in pediatric patients with positive anti-SSA and/or anti-SSB antibodies. Subjects under age 18 with positive anti-SSA and/or anti-SSB antibodies were screened and enrolled in a tertiary hospital in Taiwan. Data were collected via medical records, including age, gender, onset of the primary rheumatic disease, clinical symptoms and signs, and the medication used. Schirmer test for Sjögren's syndrome (SS) screening was performed in all enrolled patients. Among twenty enrolled subjects, seventeen of them had systemic lupus erythematosus; four of them were diagnosed as SS with positive Schirmer test. In addition to antinuclear antibodies and anti-DNA antibodies, other common autoantibodies were anti-RNP antibodies (50 %) and anti-Sm antibodies (30 %). The most common symptoms were arthritis (60 %) followed by malar rash (40 %). In conclusion, we observed that a low proportion of childhood SS (4/20) exists in our patients with positive SSA and/or anti-SSB antibodies. It is suggested that clinicians should focus more on the clinical symptoms in these patients, rather than undertaking invasive diagnostic interventions to rule out Sjögren's syndrome. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

84905247126	Atopic dermatitis, melatonin, and sleep disturbance	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sleep disturbance is common in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). However, studies have largely been questionnaire-based, and the pathophysiology remains unclear. The aims of this study were to determine objective characteristics of sleep disturbance in children with AD and explore contributing factors and clinical predictors. METHODS: Sleep parameters were measured by actigraphy and polysomnography in 72 patients with AD and 32 controls ages 1 to 18 years. Urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels, serum cytokines, and total and allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels were also measured. RESULTS: The patients with AD had significantly reduced sleep efficiency, longer sleep onset latency, more sleep fragmentation, and less nonrapid eye movement sleep. Results from actigraphy correlated well with those from polysomnography. The AD disease severity was associated with sleep disturbance (r = 0.55-0.7), and a Scoring Atopic Dermatitis index of ≥48.7 predicted poor sleep efficiency with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 75% (area under the curve = 0.81, P = .001). Lower nocturnal melatonin secretion was significantly associated with sleep disturbance in the patients with AD. Other correlates of sleep disturbance included pruritus, scratching movements, higher total serum IgE levels, and allergic sensitization to dust mite and staphylococcal enterotoxins. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep efficiency is common in children with AD and can be predicted by the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis index. Melatonin and IgE might play a role in the sleep disturbance. Further studies are required to explore the mechanisms and clinical implications, and actigraphy could serve as a useful evaluating tool. Copyright © 2014 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
