38049107794	Sequence analysis of an Archaeal virus isolated from a hypersaline lake in Inner Mongolia, China	Background: We are profoundly ignorant about the diversity of viruses that infect the domain Archaea. Less than 100 have been identified and described and very few of these have had their genomic sequences determined. Here we report the genomic sequence of a previously undescribed archaeal virus. Results: Haloarchaeal strains with 16S rRNA gene sequences 98% identical to Halorubrum saccharovorum were isolated from a hypersaline lake in Inner Mongolia. Two lytic viruses infecting these were isolated from the lake water. The BJ1 virus is described in this paper. It has an icosahedral head and tail morphology and most likely a linear double stranded DNA genome exhibiting terminal redundancy. Its genome sequence has 42,271 base pairs with a GC content of ∼65 mol%. The genome of BJ1 is predicted to encode 70 ORFs, including one for a tRNA. Fifty of the seventy ORFs had no identity to data base entries; twenty showed sequence identity matches to archaeal viruses and to haloarchaea. ORFs possibly coding for an origin of replication complex, integrase, helicase and structural capsid proteins were identified. Evidence for viral integration was obtained. Conclusion: The virus described here has a very low sequence identity to any previously described virus. Fifty of the seventy ORFs could not be annotated in any way based on amino acid identities with sequences already present in the databases. Determining functions for ORFs such as these is probably easier using a simple virus as a model system. © 2007 Pagaling et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0034067475	Characterization of Micrococcus antarcticus sp. nov., a psychrophilic bacterium from Antarctica	A Gram-positive, cold-adapted, aerobic, spherical actinobacterium (strain T2(T)) with a quite low cardinal growth temperature was isolated from Chinese Great-Wall station in Antarctica. Sequence comparisons of the 16S rDNA indicated the isolate to be a phylogenetic member of the genus Micrococcus, family Micrococcaceae, in which it represents a novel lineage. The phylogenetic distinctness of the isolate with respect to the type strains Micrococcus luteus and Micrococcus lylae was supported by DNA-DNA similarity values of less than 40%. Chemotaxonomic properties supported the placement of the isolate in the genus Micrococcus. The diagnostic diamino acid of the cell-wall peptidoglycan is lysine.

39049188138	Gene cloning and characterization of a novel α-amylase from alkaliphilic Alkalimonas amylolytica	A gene encoding an extracellular α-amylase (AmyA) was cloned from the alkaliphilic bacterium Alkalimonas amylolytica by enzymatic activity screening in Escherichia coli DH5α. The gene amyA consists of 1764 base pairs and was predicted to encode a 587-amino acid protein encompassing a 31-amino acid signal peptide. In addition, a 459-amino acid catalytic domain and a 97-amino acid starch-binding domain (SBD) were found. The SBD showed little similarity to other known SBDs; instead, it contains conserved amino acids typically belonging to the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) family 20. AmyA could act on both granular and gelatinized starch. The catalytic domain of the enzyme showed little similarity to other known α-amylases. Rather, AmyA contains four characteristic conserved regions of glycoside hydrolase family 13. The recombinant enzyme was a liquefying enzyme with the highest activity at 50°C and pH 9.5. The enzyme displayed a unique endo-product profile and action pattern on soluble starch to yield a series of malto-oligosaccharides ranging from maltose to maltoheptaose.

33644868996	Identification of eukaryotic open reading frames in metagenomic cDNA libraries made from environmental samples	Here we describe the application of metagenomic technologies to construct cDNA libraries from RNA isolated from environmental samples. RNAlater (Ambion) was shown to stabilize RNA in environmental samples for periods of at least 3 months at -20°C. Protocols for library construction were established on total RNA extracted from Acanthamoeba polyphaga trophozoites. The methodology was then used on algal mats from geothermal hot springs in Tengchong county, Yunnan Province, People's Republic of China, and activated sludge from a sewage treatment plant in Leicestershire, United Kingdom. The Tenchong libraries were dominated by RNA from prokaryotes, reflecting the mainly prokaryote microbial composition. The majority of these clones resulted from rRNA; only a few appeared to be derived from mRNA. In contrast, many clones from the activated sludge library had significant similarity to eukaryote mRNA-encoded protein sequences. A library was also made using polyadenylated RNA isolated from total RNA from activated sludge; many more clones in this library were related to eukaryotic mRNA sequences and proteins. Open reading frames (ORFs) up to 378 amino acids in size could be identified. Some resembled known proteins over their full length, e.g., 36% match to cystatin, 49% match to ribosomal protein L32, 63% match to ribosomal protein S16, 70% to CPC2 protein. The methodology described here permits the polyadenylated transcriptome to be isolated from environmental samples with no knowledge of the identity of the microorganisms in the sample or the necessity to culture them. It has many uses, including the identification of novel eukaryotic ORFs encoding proteins and enzymes. Copyright © 2006, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

34248654099	The proteomic alterations of Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis cultured at different temperatures	Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, one of many thermophilic organisms, survives harsh living conditions in temperatures ranging from 50 to 80°C. In this comprehensive analysis, we present a robust approach, 2-DE and MALDI-TOF MS, to compare and identify the bacterial proteins responding to the temperature stress. In total, 164 spots of 2-DE were found with the significant changes in spot volume at three culture temperatures, 55, 75, and 80°C, respectively; furthermore, 87 unique proteins were characterized by MS. Our results reveal that the electrophoretic images of the bacterial proteins, extracted from two culture temperatures (55 and 75°C), had similar patterns; however, the bacteria cultured at 80°C had dramatically decreased their spot volumes. Additionally, the temperature-sensitive proteins are broadly divided into two groups: specific expression at certain temperatures and consistent changes of expression responsive to temperature. For instance, three proteins closely related with redox regulation, dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, and ferredoxin, were only detected in the bacteria cultured at 55°C. Whereas, two chaperonins, GroES and GroEL, were found to show a consistent increase during the elevated temperatures with the determinations, either by MS or Western blot. The proteomic information, thus expedites our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regarding how thermophilic bacteria adapt to the alterations in living environment. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

77954604280	Proteome reference map and comparative proteomic analysis between a wild type clostridium acetobutylicumDSM 1731 and its mutant with enhanced butanol tolerance and butanol yield	The solventogenic bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum is an important species of the Clostridium community. To develop a fundamental tool that is useful for biological studies of C. acetobutylicum, we established a high resolution proteome reference map for this species. We identified 1206 spots representing 564 different proteins by mass spectrometry, covering approximately 50% of major metabolic pathways. To better understand the relationship between butanol tolerance and butanol yield, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis between the wild type strain DSM 1731 and the mutant Rh8, which has higher butanol tolerance and higher butanol yield. Comparative proteomic analysis of two strains at acidogenic and solventogenic phases revealed 102 differentially expressed proteins that are mainly involved in protein folding, solvent formation, amino acid metabolism, protein synthesis, nucleotide metabolism, transport, and others. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that over 70% of the 102 differentially expressed proteins in mutant Rh8 were either upregulated (e.g., chaperones and solvent formation related) or downregulated (e.g., amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis related) in both acidogenic and solventogenic phase, which, respectively, are only upregulated or downregulated in solventogenic phase in the wild type strain. This suggests that Rh8 cells have evolved a mechanism to prepare themselves for butanol challenge before butanol is produced, leading to an increased butanol yield. This is the first report on the comparative proteome analysis of a mutant strain and a base strain of C. acetobutylicum. The fundamental proteomic data and analyses will be useful for further elucidating the biological mechanism of butanol tolerance and/or enhanced butanol production. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77954313974	Efficient production of l-lactic acid from cassava powder by Lactobacillus rhamnosus	Cassava is one of the most efficient and rich crops in terms of carbohydrate production, which is a tropical perennial plant that grows on poor or depleted soils. Microbial conversion of such a renewable raw material to useful products is an important objective in industrial biotechnology. l-Lactic acid was efficiently produced from cassava powder by a Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain CASL. The fermentation properties of cassava powder were compared with those of glucose and corn powder. The efficiencies of various fermentation strategies for l-lactic acid production from cassava powder, including simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), two-step fermentation (TSF) and simultaneous liquefaction, saccharification and fermentation (SLSF), were investigated. The high l-lactic acid concentration (175.4. g/l) was obtained using 275. g/l of cassava powder concentration (total sugar of 222.5. g/l) in SSF batch fermentation. This is the highest l-lactic acid concentration reported, from cassava source, and it provides an efficient l-lactic acid production process with cheap raw bioresources, such as cassava powder. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

80052932685	Effects of Continuous Thermophilic Composting (CTC) on Bacterial Community in the Active Composting Process	The method of continuous thermophilic composting (CTC) remarkably shortened the active composting cycle and enhanced the compost stability. Effects of CTC on the quantities of bacteria, with a comparison to the traditional composting (TC) method, were explored by plate count with incubation at 30, 40 and 50°C, respectively, and by quantitative PCR targeting the universal bacterial 16S rRNA genes and the Bacillus 16S rRNA genes. The comparison of cultivatable or uncultivatable bacterial numbers indicated that CTC might have increased the biomass of bacteria, especially Bacillus spp., during the composting. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis was employed to investigate the effects of CTC on bacterial diversity, and a community dominated by fewer species was detected in a typical CTC run. The analysis of sequence and phylogeny based on DGGE indicated that the continuously high temperature had changed the structure of bacterial community and strengthened the mainstay role of the thermophilic and spore-forming Bacillus spp. in CTC run. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The deduced amino acid sequence had 68 % identity with the endo-1,4-beta-xylanase from Paenibacilluslactis 154 that belonged to family 10 of the glycoside hydrolases. Purified recombinant Xyn10A had maximum activity at 40 °C and pH 7. 0, with the specific activity of 105 U/mg and a Km of 0. 6 mg/ml for beechwood xylan. Xyn10A retained more than 80 % activity between 25 and 45 °C and 29 % activity at 5 °C. It exhibited the highest activity (134 %) in 0. 5 M NaCl and still retained 90 % activity in 2. 5 M NaCl. It retained about 87 % activity after incubation in 2 M NaCl for 24 h. The cold-active and halo-tolerant properties of Xyn10A make it promising for application in the food industry, especially in the processing of saline food and sea food. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

N16-5 in Pichia pastoris and characterization of the recombinant enzyme	A novel thermostable alkaline β-mannanase from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. N16-5 was expressed successfully in Pichia pastoris GS115. The combined usage of inducible and constitutive promoters (AOX1 and GAP) enhanced the expression of β-mannanase. Among the parameters investigated in shaking flask cultures, the pH value of medium had significant influence on the production of β-mannanase by recombinant P. pastoris. β-Mannanase produced at pH 7.0 was 6.7 times of that at pH value of 6.0. The highest β-mannanase activity of 32.2 IU/ml in culture supernatant was achieved at 120 h of cultivation in BMGY medium (pH 7.0). The recombinant β-mannanase was purified and characterized. The purified β-mannanase produced by P. pastoris has optimum pH of 10.0 and optimum temperature of 70 °C, which are very close to those of the native enzyme from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. N16-5. However, much higher thermal stability and pH stability were observed in recombinant β-mannanase. These properties make the recombinant β-mannanase more useful in the detergent industries, the pulp and paper processing and other industrial processes. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

4644252458	Alkalimonas amylolytica gen. nov., sp. nov., and Alkalimonas delamerensis gen. nov., sp. nov., novel alkaliphilic bacteria from soda lakes in China and East Africa	Two related novel alkaliphilic and slightly halophilic bacteria are described. They are strain N10 from Lake Chahannor in China and strain 1E1 from Lake Elmenteita in East Africa. Both strains are strictly aerobic, heterotrophic, alkaliphilic, mesophilic, and require NaCl for growth. The optimal conditions for growth were at pH 10-10.5 and 2-3% (w/v) NaCl. Cells of both strains were Gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, and motile with a single polar flagellum. Cellular fatty acids in both strains were predominantly saturated and mono-unsaturated straight-chain fatty acids (16:0, 16:1ω7c and 18:1ω7c). The major isoprenoid quinone of both strains was Q8. The major polar lipids are phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate and phosphatidylethanolamine. The guanine plus cytosine (G+C) content of the DNA was 52.5 mol% and 55.4 mol%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two strains formed a distinct lineage within the gamma-3 subclass of the Proteobacteria.

We cultured Alkalimonas amylolytica N10 (N10), a novel alkaliphilic bacterium found in Lake Chahannor, in media with three different pHs and extracted the correspondent membrane and cytoplasm proteins for proteomic analysis through 2-DE. The differential 2-DE spots corresponding to the altered pHs were delivered to MALDI TOF/TOF MS for protein identification. Since the genomic data of strain N10 was unavailable, we encountered a problem at low rate of protein identification with 18.1%. We employed, therefore, a combined strategy of de novo sequencing to analyze MS/MS signals generated from MALDI TOF/TOF MS. A significantly improved rate of protein identification was thus achieved at over than 70.0%. Furthermore, we extensively investigated the expression of these pH-dependent N10 genes using Western blot and real-time PCR. The conclusions drawn from immunoblot and mRNA measurements were mostly in agreement with the proteomic observations. We conducted the bioinformatic analysis to all the pH-dependent N10 proteins and found that some membrane proteins participated in iron transport were differentially expressed as external pH elevated and most of differential proteins with increased or bell-shape mode of pH-dependence were involved in bioenergetic process and metabolism of carbohydrates, fatty acid, amino acids, and nucleotides. Our data thus provide a functional profile of the pH-responsive proteins in alkaliphiles, leading to elucidation of alkaliphilic-adaptive mechanism. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

66849093373	Systematic characterization of a novel gal operon in Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis	On the basis of the Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis genome, a novel type of gal operon was deduced. The gene expression and biochemical properties of this operon were further characterized. RT-PCR analysis of the intergenic regions suggested that the transcription of the gal operon was continuous. With gene cloning and enzyme activity assays, TTE1929, TTE1928 and TTE1927 were identified to be GalT, GalK and GalE, respectively. Results elicited from polarimetry assays revealed that TTE1925, a hypothetical protein, was a novel mutarotase, termed MR-Tt. TTE1926 was identified as a regulator that could bind to two operators in the operon promoter. The transcriptional start sites were mapped, and this suggested that there are two promoters in this operon. Expression of the gal genes was significantly induced by galactose, whereas only MR-Tt expression was detected in glucose-cultured T. tengcongensis at both the mRNA and the protein level. In addition, the abundance of gal proteins was examined at different temperatures. At temperatures ranging from 60 to 80 °C, the level of MR-Tt protein was relatively stable, but that of the other gal proteins was dramatically decreased. The operator-binding complexes were isolated and identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay-liquid chromatography (EMSA-LC) MS-MS, which suggested that several regulatory proteins, such as GalR and a sensory histidine kinase, participate in the regulation of the gal operon. © 2009 SGM.

67649213037	Proteomic analysis on the temperature-dependent complexes in Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis	It is generally accepted that protein complexes play an active role in avoiding the protein degradation of the thermophiles. Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis was cultured at three different temperatures (55, 75 and 80°C) and the extracts of protein complexes were prepared. Through blue native PAGE, the changes of the relative band volumes in response to different temperatures were semi-quantitatively compared and six temperature-dependent bands were obtained. These bands were excised, digested with trypsin and then analyzed with MS for the identification of protein components. With the combination of the proteins identified by LC MS/MS and MALDI TOF/TOF MS, a total of 92 unique proteins were ascertained in these complexes. Besides, some protein components were examined with Western blot, which gave us insights into the survival mechanism of thermophiles. These included (i) the composition of complex at 80°C was significantly different from that at the other two temperatures; (ii) HSPs presented in all temperature-dependent complexes; (iii) several proteins associated with the functional pathways existed in the same complexes, indicating that the complex structure provided facility for the functional efficiency. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

70349209122	Solution behavior and activity of a halophilic esterase under high salt concentration	Background: Halophiles are extremophiles that thrive in environments with very high concentrations of salt. Although the salt reliance and physiology of these extremophiles have been widely investigated, the molecular working mechanisms of their enzymes under salty conditions have been little explored. Methodology/Principal Findings: A halophilic esterolytic enzyme LipC derived from archeaon Haloarcula marismortui was overexpressed from Escherichia coli BL21. The purified enzyme showed a range of hydrolytic activity towards the substrates of p-nitrophenyl esters with different alkyl chains (n = 2216), with the highest activity being observed for p-nitrophenyl acetate, consistent with the basic character of an esterase. The optimal esterase activities were found to be at pH 9.5 and [NaCl] = 3.4 M or [KCl] = 3.0 M and at around 45°C. Interestingly, the hydrolysis activity showed a clear reversibility against changes in salt concentration. At the ambient temperature of 22°C, enzyme systems working under the optimal salt concentrations were very stable against time. Increase in temperature increased the activity but reduced its stability. Circular dichroism (CD), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) were deployed to determine the physical states of LipC in solution. As the salt concentration increased, DLS revealed substantial increase in aggregate sizes, but CD measurements revealed the maximal retention of the α-helical structure at the salt concentration matching the optimal activity. These observations were supported by SANS analysis that revealed the highest proportion of unimers and dimers around the optimal salt concentration, although the coexistent larger aggregates showed a trend of increasing size with salt concentration, consistent with the DLS data. Conclusions/Significance: The solution α-helical structure and activity relation also matched the highest proportion of enzyme unimers and dimers. Given that all the solutions studied were structurally inhomogeneous, it is important for future work to understand how the LipC's solution aggregation affected its activity. © 2009 Rao et al.

The TtgluA gene contained 2,253 bp, which encodes 750 amino acids. The native TtGluA was a trimer with monomer molecular mass of 89 kDa shown by SDS-PAGE. The purified recombinant enzyme showed hydrolytic activity on maltooligosaccharides, p-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranide, and dextrin with an exotype cleavage manner. TtGluA showed preference for shortchain maltooligosaccharides and the highest specific activity for maltose of 3.26 units/mg. Maximal activity was observed at 60°C and pH 5.5. The half-life was 2 h at 60°C. The enzyme showed good tolerance to urea and SDS but was inhibited by Tris. When maltose with the concentration over 50 mM was used as substrate, TtGluA was also capable of catalyzing transglycosylation to produce α-1,4-linked maltotriose and α-1,6-linked isomaltooligosaccharides. More importantly, TtGluA showed exclusive regiospecificity with high yield to produce α-1,6-linked isomaltooligosaccharides when the reaction time extended to more than 10 h.

The pectate lyase gene (pelA) contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,089 bp, encoding a 36-amino acids signal peptide and a mature protein of 326 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 35.943 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence from the pelA ORF exhibited significant homology to those of known pectate lyases in polysaccharide lyase family 1. Some conserved active-site amino acids were found in the deduced amino acid sequence of Bsp165PelA. Ca

77955506124	Kinetics of D-lactic acid production by sporolactobacillus sp. strain CASD using repeated batch fermentation	D-Lactic acid was produced by Sporolactobacillus sp. strain CASD in repeated batch fermentation with oneand two-reactor systems. The strain showed relatively high energy consumption in its growth-related metabolism in comparison with other lactic acid producers. When the fermentation was repeated with 10% (v/v) of previous culture to start a new batch, D-lactic acid production shifted from being cell-maintenance-dependent to cell-growth-dependent. In comparison with the one-reactor system, D-lactic acid production increased approximately 9% in the fourth batch of the two-reactor system. Strain CASD is an efficient D-lactic acid producer with increased growth rate at the early stage of repeated cycles, which explains the strain's physiological adaptation to repeated batch culture and improved performance in the two-reactor fermentation system. From a kinetic point of view, two-reactor fermentation system was shown to be an alternative for conventional one-reactor repeated batch operation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

78149416320	Characterization of a thermostable xylanase from an alkaliphilic Bacillus sp	A xylanase gene (xyn10) from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. N16-5 was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The deduced amino acid sequence has 85% identity with xylanase xyn10A from B. halodurans and contains two potential N-glycosylation sites. The glycosylated Xyn10 with MW 48 kDa can hydrolyze birchwood and oatspelt xylan. The enzyme had optimum activity at pH 7 and 70°C, with the specific activity of 92. 5U/mg. The Xyn10 retained over 90% residual activity at 60°C for 30 min but lost all activity at 80°C over 15 min.

78751652917	Comparative proteome analysis of alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. N16-5 grown on different carbon sources	To determine the impact of carbohydrates on the metabolic pathway in alkaliphiles, proteomes were obtained from cultures containing different carbohydrates and were resolved on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The proteomes were compared to determine differentially expressed proteins. A novel alkaliphilic bacterium (alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. N16-5 isolated from Wudunur Soda Lake, China) was isolated in media with five different carbon sources (glucose, mannose, galactose, arabinose, and xylose). Comparative proteome analysis identified 61 differentially expressed proteins, which were mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid transport, and metabolism, as well as energy production and conversion. The comparison was based on the draft genome sequence of strain N16-5. The abundance of enzymes involved in central metabolism was significantly changed when exposed to various carbohydrates. Notably, catabolite control protein A (CcpA) was up-regulated under all carbon sources compared with glucose. In addition, pentose exhibited a stronger effect than hexose in CcpA-mediated carbon catabolite repression. These results provided a fundamental understanding of carbohydrate metabolism in alkaliphiles. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The recombinant engineered strain for MAN330 production was stable during 80 generations, and the maximum yield of MAN330 reached 3,795 U/ml in 15 l fermenter. MAN330 exhibited similar pH optima, temperature optima, and substrate specificities to its full-length protein (MAN493). However, stability of MAN330 was about 7% higher than that of MAN493 from pH 9-11. MAN330 had about 10% higher stability than MAN493 from 60°C to 80°C. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

79952489592	Crystal structure and substrate-binding mode of cellulase 12A from Thermotoga maritima	Cellulases have been used in many applications to treat various carbohydrate-containing materials. Thermotoga maritima cellulase 12A (TmCel12A) belongs to the GH12 family of glycoside hydrolases. It is a β-1,4-endoglucanase that degrades cellulose molecules into smaller fragments, facilitating further utilization of the carbohydrate. Because of its hyperthermophilic nature, the enzyme is especially suitable for industrial applications. Here the crystal structure of TmCel12A was determined by using an active-site mutant E134C and its mercury-containing derivatives. It adopts a β-jellyroll protein fold typical of the GH12-family enzymes, with two curved β-sheets A and B and a central active-site cleft. Structural comparison with other GH12 enzymes shows significant differences, as found in two longer and highly twisted β-strands B8 and B9 and several loops. A unique Loop A3-B3 that contains Arg60 and Tyr61 stabilizes the substrate by hydrogen bonding and stacking, as observed in the complex crystals with cellotetraose and cellobiose. The high-resolution structures allow clear elucidation of the network of interactions between the enzyme and its substrate. The sugar residues bound to the enzyme appear to be more ordered in the -2 and -1 subsites than in the +1, +2 and -3 subsites. In the E134C crystals the bound -1 sugar at the cleavage site consistently show the α-anomeric configuration, implicating an intermediate-like structure. Proteins 2011; © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

79954526956	Comparative analysis on the membrane proteome of Clostridium acetobutylicum wild type strain and its butanol-tolerant mutant	The solventogenic bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum is the most important species of Clostridium used in the fermentation industry. However, the intolerance to butanol hampers the efficient production of solvents. Butanol toxicity has been attributed to the chaotropic effect on the cell membrane, but the knowledge on the effect of butanol on membrane associated proteins is quite limited. Using 2-DE combined with MALDI-TOF MS/MS and 1-DE integrated with LC-MS/MS, 341 proteins in the membrane fractions of cell lysate were identified, thus establishing the first comprehensive membrane proteome of C. acetobutylicum. The identified proteins are mainly involved in transport, cellular membrane/wall machinery, formation of surface coat and flagella, and energy metabolism. Comparative analysis on the membrane proteomes of the wild type strain DSM 1731 and its butanol-tolerant mutant Rh8 revealed 73 differentially expressed proteins. Hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that mutant Rh8 may have evolved a more stabilized membrane structure, and have developed a cost-efficient energy metabolism strategy, to cope with the butanol challenge. This comparative membrane proteomics study, together with our previous published work on comparative cytoplasmic proteomics, allows us to obtain a systemic understanding of the effect of butanol on cellular physiology of C. acetobutylicum. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.

79955878740	Crystal structures of Bacillus alkaline phytase in complex with divalent metal ions and inositol hexasulfate	Alkaline phytases from Bacillus species, which hydrolyze phytate to less phosphorylated myo-inositols and inorganic phosphate, have great potential as additives to animal feed. The thermostability and neutral optimum pH of Bacillus phytase are attributed largely to the presence of calcium ions. Nonetheless, no report has demonstrated directly how the metal ions coordinate phytase and its substrate to facilitate the catalytic reaction. In this study, the interactions between a phytate analog (myo-inositol hexasulfate) and divalent metal ions in Bacillus subtilis phytase were revealed by the crystal structure at 1.25Å resolution. We found all, except the first, sulfates on the substrate analog have direct or indirect interactions with amino acid residues in the enzyme active site. The structures also unraveled two active site-associated metal ions that were not explored in earlier studies. Significantly, one metal ion could be crucial to substrate binding. In addition, binding of the fourth sulfate of the substrate analog to the active site appears to be stronger than that of the others. These results indicate that alkaline phytase starts by cleaving the fourth phosphate, instead of the third or the sixth that were proposed earlier. Our high-resolution, structural representation of Bacillus phytase in complex with a substrate analog and divalent metal ions provides new insight into the catalytic mechanism of alkaline phytases in general. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79957941945	Monitoring the microbial community during solid-state acetic acid fermentation of Zhenjiang aromatic vinegar	Zhenjiang aromatic vinegar is one of the most famous Chinese traditional vinegars. In this study, change of the microbial community during its fermentation process was investigated. DGGE results showed that microbial community was comparatively stable, and the diversity has a disciplinary series of changes during the fermentation process. It was suggested that domestication of microbes and unique cycle-inoculation style used in the fermentation of Zhenjiang aromatic vinegar were responsible for comparatively stable of the microbial community. Furthermore, two clone libraries were constructed. The results showed that bacteria presented in the fermentation belonged to genus Lactobacillus, Acetobacter, Gluconacetobacter, Staphylococcus, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium and Sinorhizobium, while the fungi were genus Saccharomyces. DGGE combined with clone library analysis was an effective and credible technique for analyzing the microbial community during the fermentation process of Zhenjiang aromatic vinegar. Real-time PCR results suggested that the biomass showed a " system microbes self-domestication" process in the first 5 days, then reached a higher level at the 7th day before gradually decreasing until the fermentation ended at the 20th day.

After three rounds of error-prone PCR and screening of 4700 mutants, five variants of Cel5A with improved activities were identified by Congo Red based screening method. Compared with the wild type, the best variants 3F6 and C3-13 display 135. ±. 6% and 193. ±. 8% of the wild type specific activity for the substrate carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), besides improvements in the relative expression level in Escherichia coli system. Remarkable are especially the improvements in activities at reduced temperatures (50% of maximum activity at 50. °C and about 45. °C respectively, while 65. °C for the wild type). Molecular Dynamics simulations performed on the 3F6 and C3-13 variants show a decreased number of intra-Cel5A hydrogen bonds compared to the wild type, implying a more flexible protein skeleton which correlates well to the higher catalytic activity at lower temperatures. To investigate functions of each individual amino acid position site-directed (saturation) mutagenesis were generated and screened. Amino acid positions Val249 and Ile321 were found to be crucial for improving activity and residue Ile13 (encoded by rare codon AUA) yields an improved expression level in E. coli. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79959593923	Crystal structure of histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis MB4 and the implications for thermostability	Protein thermostability is an inherent characteristic of proteins from thermophilic microorganisms, and therefore enables these organisms to survive at extreme temperatures. Although it is well-known that thermostable proteins are critical for the growth of thermophilic organisms, the structural basis of protein thermostability is not yet fully understood. The histidine-containing phosphocarrier (HPr) protein, a phosphate shuttle protein in the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar transport system (PTS) of bacterial species, is an ideal model for investigating protein thermostability with respect to its small size and deficiency in disulphide bonds or cofactors. In this study, the HPr protein from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (TtHPr) is cloned and purified. Crystal structure with good quality has been determined at 2.3 Å resolution, which provides a firm foundation for exploring the thermostable mechanism. However, it shows that the crystal structure is conserved and no clue can be obtained from this single structure. Furthermore, detailed comparison of sequence and structure with the homologs from meso- or thermophilic bacteria shows no obvious rule for thermostability, but the extra salt-bridge existing only in thermophilic bacteria might be a better explanation for thermostability of HPr. Thus, mutations are performed to interrupt the salt-bridge in HPrs in thermophilic bacteria. Using site-directed mutations and the circular dichroism method, thermostability is evaluated, and the mutational variations are shown to have a faster denaturing rate than for wild-type viruses, indicating that mutations cause instability in the HPrs. Understanding the higher-temperature resistance of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins is essential to studies on protein folding and stability, and is critical in engineering efficient enzymes that can work at a high temperature. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

80051790743	Combinatorial strategy of sorbitol feeding and low-temperature induction leads to high-level production of alkaline β-mannanase in Pichia pastoris	A process for efficient production of an alkaline β-mannanases from Bacillus sp. N16-5 was established by heterologous expression using Pichia pastoris. A high producing strain was generated by removing the native β-mannanases signal peptide and increasing the copy number of the mature β-mannanases gene. High cell density fermentation of this strain in 1-L bioreactor led to a production level of 4164. U/mL after 96. h of induction. Sorbitol co-feeding and temperature-lowering strategies both increased the β-mannanase production levels. Combined usage of these two strategies achieved the most effective result-the enzyme level reached 6336. U/mL within 84. h, which to our best knowledge is the highest production level reported for the expression of extreme β-mannanase thus far. The strategy described in this work can also be adapted to express other important industrial enzymes with extreme properties. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

80054731153	A thermostable esterase from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis opening up a new family of bacterial lipolytic enzymes	An unidentified α/β hydrolase gene lipA3 from thermostable eubacterium species Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis MB4 was cloned and heterologously expressed by Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. The purified recombinant enzyme EstA3 turned out to be a monomeric thermostable esterase with optimal activity at 70 °C and pH 9.5. The enzyme showed lipolytic activity towards a wide range of ester substrates including p-nitrophenyl esters and triacylglycerides, with the highest activity being observed for p-nitrophenyl caproate at 150 U/mg and for Triacetin at 126 U/mg, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that EstA3 did not show homology to any identified bacterial lipolytic hydrolases. Sequence alignment showed that there was a common pentapeptide CHSMG with a cysteine replacing the first glycine in most esterase and lipase conserved motif GXSXG. The catalytic triad of EstA3 is Ser92, Asp269 and His292, which was confirmed by site directed mutagenesis. Based on the enzymatic properties and sequence alignment we concluded that the esterase EstA3 represented a novel bacterial lipolytic enzyme group and in chorological order this group was assigned as Family XIV. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

81755179388	Diverse substrate recognition mechanism revealed by Thermotoga maritima Cel5A structures in complex with cellotetraose, cellobiose and mannotriose	The hyperthermophilic endoglucanase Cel5A from Thermotoga maritima can find applications in lignocellulosic biofuel production, because it catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucan- and mannan-based polysaccharides. Here, we report the crystal structures in apo-form and in complex with three ligands, cellotetraose, cellobiose and mannotriose, at 1.29 Å to 2.40 Å resolution. The open carbohydrate-binding cavity which can accommodate oligosaccharide substrates with extensively branched chains explained the dual specificity of the enzyme. Combining our structural information and the previous kinetic data, it is suggested that this enzyme prefers β-glucosyl and β-mannosyl moieties at the reducing end and uses two conserved catalytic residues, E253 (nucleophile) and E136 (general acid/base), to hydrolyze the glycosidic bonds. Moreover, our results also suggest that the wide spectrum of Tm-Cel5A substrates might be due to the lack of steric hindrance around the C2-hydroxyl group of the glucose or mannose unit from active-site residues. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

82555205330	Genome of alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 reveals adaptations that support the ability to grow in an external pH range from 7.5 to 11.4	Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 is an extreme but facultative alkaliphile that grows non-fermentatively in a pH range from 7.5 to above 11.4 and can withstand large sudden increases in external pH. It is a model organism for studies of bioenergetics at high pH, at which energy demands are higher than at neutral pH because both cytoplasmic pH homeostasis and ATP synthesis require more energy. The alkaliphile also tolerates a cytoplasmic pH>9.0 at external pH values at which the pH homeostasis capacity is exceeded, and manages other stresses that are exacerbated at alkaline pH, e.g. sodium, oxidative and cell wall stresses. The genome of B. pseudofirmus OF4 includes two plasmids that are lost from some mutants without viability loss. The plasmids may provide a reservoir of mobile elements that promote adaptive chromosomal rearrangements under particular environmental conditions. The genome also reveals a more acidic pI profile for proteins exposed on the outer surface than found in neutralophiles. A large array of transporters and regulatory genes are predicted to protect the alkaliphile from its overlapping stresses. In addition, unanticipated metabolic versatility was observed, which could ensure requisite energy for alkaliphily under diverse conditions. © 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

BG-CS10 was isolated from Zabuye Salt Lake, Tibet. The gene celB, encoding a halophilic cellulase was identified from the genomic library of BG-CS10. CelB belongs to the cellulase superfamily and DUF291 superfamily, with an unknown function domain and less than 58% identity to other cellulases in GenBank. The purified recombinant protein (molecular weight: 62 kDa) can hydrolyze soluble cellulose substrates containing beta-1,4-linkages, such as carboxylmethyl cellulose and konjac glucomannan, but has no exoglucanase and β-glucosidase activities. Thus, CelB is a cellulase with an endo mode of action and glucomannanase activity. Interestingly, the enzyme activity was increased approximately tenfold with 2. 5 M NaCl or 3 M KCl. Furthermore, the optimal temperatures were 55°C with 2. 5 M NaCl and 35°C without NaCl, respectively. This indicates that NaCl can improve enzyme thermostability. The K

Engineering of enzymes for better thermostability is of great importance because it not only can broaden their industrial applications, but also facilitate exploring the mechanism of enzyme stability from structural point of view. To obtain enzyme with higher thermostability and specific activity, structure-based rational design was carried out in this study. Eleven mutants of Fibrobacter succinogenes 1,3-1,4-β-d-glucanase were constructed in attempt to improve the enzyme properties. In particular, the crude proteins expressed in Pichia pastoris were examined firstly to ensure that the protein productions meet the need for industrial fermentation. The crude protein of V18Y mutant showed a 2 °C increment of Tm and W203Y showed ∼30% increment of the specific activity. To further investigate the structure-function relationship, some mutants were expressed and purified from P. pastoris and Escherichia coli. Notably, the specific activity of purified W203Y which was expressed in E. coli was 63% higher than the wild-type protein. The double mutant V18Y/W203Y showed the same increments of Tm and specific activity as the single mutants did. When expressed and purified from E. coli, V18Y/W203Y showed similar pattern of thermostability increment and 75% higher specific activity. Furthermore, the apo-form and substrate complex structures of V18Y/W203Y were solved by X-ray crystallography. Analyzing protein structure of V18Y/W203Y helps elucidate how the mutations could enhance the protein stability and enzyme activity. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84862772588	Introducing a single secondary alcohol dehydrogenase into butanol-tolerant Clostridium acetobutylicum Rh8 switches ABE fermentation to high level IBE fermentation	Background: Previously we have developed a butanol tolerant mutant of Clostridium acetobutylicum Rh8, from the wild type strain DSM 1731. Strain Rh8 can tolerate up to 19g/L butanol, with solvent titer improved accordingly, thus exhibiting industrial application potential. To test if strain Rh8 can be used for production of high level mixed alcohols, a single secondary alcohol dehydrogenase from Clostridium beijerinckii NRRL B593 was overexpressed in strain Rh8 under the control of thl promoter. Results: The heterogenous gene sADH was functionally expressed in C. acetobutylicum Rh8. This simple, one-step engineering approach switched the traditional ABE (acetone-butanol-ethanol) fermentation to IBE (isopropanol-butanol-ethanol) fermentation. The total alcohol titer reached 23.88g/l (7.6g/l isopropanol, 15g/l butanol, and 1.28g/l ethanol) with a yield to glucose of 31.42%. The acid (butyrate and acetate) assimilation rate in isopropanol producing strain Rh8(psADH) was increased. Conclusions: The improved butanol tolerance and the enhanced solvent biosynthesis machinery in strain Rh8 is beneficial for production of high concentration of mixed alcohols. Strain Rh8 can thus be considered as a good host for further engineering of solvent/alcohol production. © 2012 dai et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84863198376	Bacterial and archaeal diversity in two hot spring microbial mats from the geothermal region of Tengchong, China	We investigated the bacterial and archaeal diversity in two hot spring microbial mats from the geothermal region of Tengchong in the Yunnan Province, China, using direct molecular analyses. The Langpu (LP) laminated mat was found by the side of a boiling pool with temperature of 60-65 °C and a pH of 8.5, while the Tengchong (TC) streamer mat consisted of white streamers in a slightly acidic (pH 6.5) hot pool outflow with a temperature of 72 °C. Four 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed and restriction enzyme analysis of the inserts was used to identify unique sequences and clone frequencies. From almost 200 clones screened, 55 unique sequences were retrieved. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the LP mat consisted of a diverse bacterial population [Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Chlorobia, Nitrospirae, 'Deinococcus-Thermus', Proteobacteria (alpha, beta and delta subdivisions), Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria], while the archaeal population was dominated by methanogenic Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota. In contrast, the TC streamer mat consisted of a bacterial population dominated by Aquificae, while the archaeal population also contained Korarchaeota as well as Crenarchaeota and methanogenic Euryarchaeota. These mats harboured clone sequences affiliated to unidentified lineages, suggesting that they are a potential source for discovering novel bacteria and archaea. © 2012 Springer.

84864618029	Enhanced activity of Thermotoga maritima cellulase 12A by mutating a unique surface loop	Cellulase 12A from Thermotoga maritima (TmCel12A) is a hyperthermostable ß-1,4-endoglucanase. We recently determined the crystal structures of TmCel12A and its complexes with oligosaccharides. Here, by using sitedirected mutagenesis, the role played by Arg60 and Tyr61 in a unique surface loop of TmCel12A was investigated. The results are consistent with the previously observed hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions between these two residues and the substrate. Interestingly, the mutant Y61G had the highest activity when compared with the wild-type enzyme and the other mutants. It also shows a wider range of working temperatures than does the wild type, along with retention of the hyperthermostability. The kcat and Km values of Y61G are both higher than those of the wild type. In conjunction with the crystal structure of Y61G-substrate complex, the kinetic data suggest that the higher endoglucanase activity is probably due to facile dissociation of the cleaved sugar moiety at the reducing end. Additional crystallographic analyses indicate that the insertion and deletion mutations at the Tyr61 site did not affect the overall protein structure, but local perturbations might diminish the substrate-binding strength. It is likely that the catalytic efficiency of TmCel12A is a subtle balance between substrate binding and product release. The activity enhancement by the single mutation of Y61G provides a good example of engineered enzyme for industrial application. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

84871192686	Transcription Elongation Factor GreA Has Functional Chaperone Activity	Background: Bacterial GreA is an indispensable factor in the RNA polymerase elongation complex. It plays multiple roles in transcriptional elongation, and may be implicated in resistance to various stresses. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we show that Escherichia coli GreA inhibits aggregation of several substrate proteins under heat shock condition. GreA can also effectively promote the refolding of denatured proteins. These facts reveal that GreA has chaperone activity. Distinct from many molecular chaperones, GreA does not form stable complexes with unfolded substrates. GreA overexpression confers the host cells with enhanced resistance to heat shock and oxidative stress. Moreover, GreA expression in the greA/greB double mutant could suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype, and dramatically alleviate the in vivo protein aggregation. The results suggest that bacterial GreA may act as chaperone in vivo. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that GreA, in addition to its function as a transcription factor, is involved in protection of cellular proteins against aggregation. © 2012 Li et al.

Fermentative production of isobutanol had been realized in several microorganisms by combining branched-chain amino acids synthetic pathway and Ehrlich pathway. In contrast to using plasmid overexpression and inducible promoters, genetically stable Escherichia coli strains for isobutanol production were constructed in this work by integrating essential genes into chromosome. A chromosome-based markerless gene modulation method was then developed for fine-tuning gene expression with multiple regulatory parts to improve isobutanol production. There was also a cofactor imbalance problem for anaerobic isobutanol synthesis. NADPH is the reducing equivalent required for isobutanol production, while the common reducing equivalent under anaerobic condition is NADH. Two strategies were used to modulate expression of transhydrogenase (pntAB) and NAD kinase (yfjB) genes to increase NADPH supply for improving isobutanol production. Plasmid overexpression of pntAB and yfjB genes either individually or in combination had little effect on isobutanol production. In contrast, modulating pntAB and yfjB gene expression in chromosome with multiple regulatory parts identified optimal modulators under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively, and improved isobutanol production. Modulating pntAB gene alone led to 20% and 8% increase of anaerobic isobutanol titer and yield. Although modulating yfjB gene alone had nearly no effect, modulating pntAB and yfjB genes in combination led to 50% and 30% increase of isobutanol titer and yield in comparison with modulating pntAB gene alone. It was also found that increasing pntAB gene expression alone had a threshold for improving anaerobic isobutanol production, while activating NAD kinase could break through this threshold, leading to a yield of 0.92. mol/mol. Our results suggested that transhydrogenase and NAD kinase had a synergistic effect on increasing NADPH supply and improving anaerobic isobutanol production. This strategy will be useful for improving production of target compounds using NADPH as reducing equivalent within their synthetic pathways. In addition, combined activation of PntAB and YfjB led to 28% and 22% increase of aerobic isobutanol titer and yield, resulting in production of 10.8. g/L isobutanol in 24. h with a yield of 0.62. mol/mol. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84872231185	Global Microarray Analysis of Carbohydrate Use in Alkaliphilic Hemicellulolytic Bacterium Bacillus sp. N16-5	The alkaliphilic hemicellulolytic bacterium Bacillus sp. N16-5 has a broad substrate spectrum and exhibits the capacity to utilize complex carbohydrates such as galactomannan, xylan, and pectin. In the monosaccharide mixture, sequential utilization by Bacillus sp. N16-5 was observed. Glucose appeared to be its preferential monosaccharide, followed by fructose, mannose, arabinose, xylose, and galactose. Global transcription profiles of the strain were determined separately for growth on six monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, arabinose, and xylose) and four polysaccharides (galactomannan, xylan, pectin, and sodium carboxymethylcellulose) using one-color microarrays. Numerous genes potentially related to polysaccharide degradation, sugar transport, and monosaccharide metabolism were found to respond to a specific substrate. Putative gene clusters for different carbohydrates were identified according to transcriptional patterns and genome annotation. Identification and analysis of these gene clusters contributed to pathway reconstruction for carbohydrate utilization in Bacillus sp. N16-5. Several genes encoding putative sugar transporters were highly expressed during growth on specific sugars, suggesting their functional roles. Two phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems were identified as candidate transporters for mannose and fructose, and a major facilitator superfamily transporter was identified as a candidate transporter for arabinose and xylose. Five carbohydrate uptake transporter 1 family ATP-binding cassette transporters were predicted to participate in the uptake of hemicellulose and pectin degradation products. Collectively, microarray data improved the pathway reconstruction involved in carbohydrate utilization of Bacillus sp. N16-5 and revealed that the organism precisely regulates gene transcription in response to fluctuations in energy resources. © 2013 Song et al.

84872659403	Development of thermodynamic optimum searching (TOS) to improve the prediction accuracy of flux balance analysis	Flux balance analysis (FBA) has been widely used in calculating steady-state flux distributions that provide important information for metabolic engineering. Several thermodynamics-based methods, for example, quantitative assignment of reaction directionality and energy balance analysis have been developed to improve the prediction accuracy of FBA. However, these methods can only generate a thermodynamically feasible range, rather than the most thermodynamically favorable solution. We therefore developed a novel optimization method termed as thermodynamic optimum searching (TOS) to calculate the thermodynamically optimal solution, based on the second law of thermodynamics, the minimum magnitude of the Gibbs free energy change and the maximum entropy production principle (MEPP). Then, TOS was applied to five physiological conditions of Escherichia coli to evaluate its effectiveness. The resulting prediction accuracy was found significantly improved (10.7-48.5%) by comparing with the

84872837119	Engineering Escherichia Coli for adipic acid production	Adipic Acid, six-carbon straight-chain dicarboxylic acid, is linked almost 90% to nylon production by the polycondensation with hexamethylenediamine and further processed into fibers for applications in carpeting, automobile tire cord and clothing. Almost all of the commercial adipic acid is produced from cyclohexane through two sequent oxidation processes. The process is regarded as poor because the yield is low and the chemicals used are not environmentally friendly. Consequently, extensive research has been directed towards developing an alternative, clean process based on microbial production. Here, we reported that Escherichia coli was engineered to produce adipic acid. Three genes of aroZ, aroY and catA from different bacteria with or without codon optimization, which encoded dehdroshikimate dehydratase, protocatechuate decarboxylase and catechol 1, 2-dioxygenase, respectively, were combinatorially assembled into the heterogeneous synthetic pathway and introduced into the cell of E. coli to complete the whole biosynthetic pathway for conversing glucose to cis, cis-muconic aicd, the precursor of adipic aicd, and then cis, cis-muconic acid was hydrogenated into adipic acid. With blocking the pathway to aromatic acid biosynthsis by mutating shikimate dehydrogenase (AroE) and combinatirally regulating the heterogeneous synthetic pathway with different constitute promoter with different strength in E. coli, the production of cis, cis-muconic acid was improved. In the shaking-flask test, 11.2g/L adipic acid was produced from 30g/L glucose. The genetic modification in combination with metabolic evolution was ongoing to further improve adipic acid production in engineered E. coli. Our study showed the potential to provide a rationale for the engineering and commercialization of microorganisms capable of producing adipic acid.

84875489054	Transcriptome analysis of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii during the process of lipid accumulation	Algae are potential candidates for biodiesel production; thus, it is important to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of their lipid metabolism. Time-course transcriptome analyses were carried out during the lipid biosynthesis and accumulation processes of the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using the Illumina RNA-seq platform. Transcriptome results indicated that over 2500 genes are upregulated or during lipid accumulation compared to log phase growth. As a proof of principle, two of the enzymes required for lipid metabolism that were significantly up-regulated during lipid accumulation, Lyso-Phosphatidic Acid Acyltransferase (LPAAT), diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DAGAT) were knocked down using artificial microRNAs. Neutral lipid production decreased in strains knocked down in expression of the lpaat and dagat genes. In addition, forty-one transcription factors were up- or down-regulated during the lipid accumulation process. This transcriptome data will be useful for engineering economic algae species aimed at biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Here we have constructed and optimized Β-carotene synthetic pathway in Escherichia coli, followed by engineering central metabolic modules to increase ATP and NADPH supplies for improving Β-carotene production. The whole Β-carotene synthetic pathway was divided into five modules. Engineering MEP module resulted in 3.5-fold increase of Β-carotene yield, while engineering Β-carotene synthesis module resulted in another 3.4-fold increase. The best Β-carotene yield increased 21%, 17% and 39% after modulating single gene of ATP synthesis, pentose phosphate and TCA modules, respectively. Combined engineering of TCA and PPP modules had a synergistic effect on improving Β-carotene yield, leading to 64% increase of Β-carotene yield over a high producing parental strain. Fed-batch fermentation of the best strain CAR005 was performed, which produced 2.1. g/L Β-carotene with a yield of 60. mg/g DCW. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity by Ni-NTA column and its catalytic properties were studied. PasCR strictly used NADPH as cofactor, gel filtration and SDS-PAGE analysis suggested that the native form of PasCR was a dimmer. PasCR exhibited the highest activity at 35°C in phosphate buffer at pH 6.5. The enzyme catalyzed the reduction of some bulky diaryl ketones, such as 4-methylbenzophenone, 2-methylbenzophenone and 4-chlorobenzophenone, especially for 4-methylbenzophenone, the product S - alcohol was obtained with 85% ee. © 2013 by the institute of Microbiology.

84875036107	The alkaline pectate lyase PEL168 of Bacillus subtilis heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris is more stable and efficient for degumming ramie fiber	Background: The conventional degumming process of ramie with alkaline treatment at high temperature causes severe environmental pollution. Pectate lyases can be used to remove pectin from ramie in a degumming process with reduced environmental pollution and energy consumption. Pectate lyase PEL168 from Bacillus subtilis has been previously characterized and the protein structure was resolved. However, Bacillus is not a suitable host for pectate lyases during the degumming process since most Bacillus produce cellulases endogenously with a detrimental effect to the fiber. Pichia pastoris, which does not express endogenous cellulases and has high secretion capability, will be an ideal host for the expression. No previous work was reported concerning the heterologous expression of pectate lyase PEL168 in P. pastoris with an aim for industrial application in ramie bio-degumming.Results: The gene pel168 was expressed in P. pastoris in this study. The recombinant protein PEL168 in P. pastoris (PEL168P) showed two bands of 48.6 kDa and 51.4 kDa on SDS-PAGE whereas the enzyme expressed in E. coli (PEL168E) was the same as predicted with a band of 46 kDa. Deglycosylation digestion suggested that PEL168P was glycosylated. The optimum reaction temperature of the two PEL168s was 50°C, and the optimum pH 9.5. After preincubation at 60°C for 20 min, PEL168E completely lost its activity, whereas PEL168P kept 26% of the residual activity. PEL168P had a specific activity of 1320 U/mg with a K

84875966177	A Novel Alkaliphilic Bacillus Esterase Belongs to the 13th Bacterial Lipolytic Enzyme Family	Background: Microbial derived lipolytic hydrolysts are an important class of biocatalysts because of their huge abundance and ability to display bioactivities under extreme conditions. In spite of recent advances, our understanding of these enzymes remains rudimentary. The aim of our research is to advance our understanding by seeking for more unusual lipid hydrolysts and revealing their molecular structure and bioactivities. Methodology/Principal Findings: Bacillus. pseudofirmus OF4 is an extreme alkaliphile with tolerance of pH up to 11. In this work we successfully undertook a heterologous expression of a gene estof4 from the alkaliphilic B. pseudofirmus sp OF4. The recombinant protein called EstOF4 was purified into a homologous product by Ni-NTA affinity and gel filtration. The purified EstOF4 was active as dimer with the molecular weight of 64 KDa. It hydrolyzed a wide range of substrates including p-nitrophenyl esters (C2-C12) and triglycerides (C2-C6). Its optimal performance occurred at pH 8.5 and 50°C towards p-nitrophenyl caproate and triacetin. Sequence alignment revealed that EstOF4 shared 71% identity to esterase Est30 from Geobacillus stearothermophilus with a typical lipase pentapeptide motif G91LS93LG95. A structural model developed from homology modeling revealed that EstOF4 possessed a typical esterase 6α/7β hydrolase fold and a cap domain. Site-directed mutagenesis and inhibition studies confirmed the putative catalytic triad Ser93, Asp190 and His220. Conclusion: EstOF4 is a new bacterial esterase with a preference to short chain ester substrates. With a high sequence identity towards esterase Est30 and several others, EstOF4 was classified into the same bacterial lipolytic family, Family XIII. All the members in this family originate from the same bacterial genus, bacillus and display optimal activities from neutral pH to alkaline conditions with short and middle chain length substrates. However, with roughly 70% sequence identity, these enzymes showed hugely different thermal stabilities, indicating their diverse thermal adaptations via just changing a few amino acid residues. © 2013 Lu et al.

With an initial glucose concentration of 80. g/L, a high overall l-lactic acid productivity of 8.15. g/L/h was achieved using NaOH as a neutralizing agent. The fed-batch fermentations were carried out under both sterile and nonsterile conditions. Under the nonsterile condition, 125. g/L l-lactic acid was obtained with a high percent yield and average productivity of 98.33% and 3.79. g/L/h, respectively. These values were consistent with the results from sterile condition. No d-isomers of lactic acid were detected, resulting in an optical purity of 100% in both conditions. The high levels of optically pure l-lactic acid produced by Exiguobacterium sp. 8-11-1, combined with the ease of handling and low costs associated with the open fermentation strategy, provide a novel and potentially important approach for l-lactic acid production in the future. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84881408981	Escherichia coli transcription termination factor NusA: Heat-induced oligomerization and chaperone activity	Escherichia coli NusA, an essential component of the RNA polymerase elongation complex, is involved in transcriptional elongation, termination, anti-termination, cold shock and stress-induced mutagenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that NusA can self-assemble into oligomers under heat shock conditions and that this property is largely determined by the C-terminal domain. In parallel with the self-assembly process, NusA also acquires chaperone activity. Furthermore, NusA overexpression results in the enhanced heat shock resistance of host cells, which may be due to the chaperone activity of NusA. Our results suggest that E. coli NusA can act as a protector to prevent protein aggregation under heat stress conditions in vitro and in the NusA-overexpressing strain. We propose a new hypothesis that NusA could serve as a molecular chaperone in addition to its functions as a transcription factor. However, it remains to be further investigated whether NusA has the same function under normal physiological conditions.

84884601555	Genome replication engineering assisted continuous evolution (GREACE) to improve microbial tolerance for biofuels production	Background: Microbial production of biofuels requires robust cell growth and metabolism under tough conditions. Conventionally, such tolerance phenotypes were engineered through evolutionary engineering using the principle of "Mutagenesis followed-by Selection". The iterative rounds of mutagenesis-selection and frequent manual interventions resulted in discontinuous and inefficient strain improvement processes. This work aimed to develop a more continuous and efficient evolutionary engineering method termed as "Genome Replication Engineering Assisted Continuous Evolution" (GREACE) using "Mutagenesis coupled-with Selection" as its core principle. Results: The core design of GREACE is to introduce an in vivo continuous mutagenesis mechanism into microbial cells by introducing a group of genetically modified proofreading elements of the DNA polymerase complex to accelerate the evolution process under stressful conditions. The genotype stability and phenotype heritability can be stably maintained once the genetically modified proofreading element is removed, thus scarless mutants with desired phenotypes can be obtained.Kanamycin resistance of E. coli was rapidly improved to confirm the concept and feasibility of GREACE. Intrinsic mechanism analysis revealed that during the continuous evolution process, the accumulation of genetically modified proofreading elements with mutator activities endowed the host cells with enhanced adaptation advantages. We further showed that GREACE can also be applied to engineer n-butanol and acetate tolerances. In less than a month, an E. coli strain capable of growing under an n-butanol concentration of 1.25% was isolated. As for acetate tolerance, cell growth of the evolved E. coli strain increased by 8-fold under 0.1% of acetate. In addition, we discovered that adaptation to specific stresses prefers accumulation of genetically modified elements with specific mutator strengths. Conclusions: We developed a novel GREACE method using "Mutagenesis coupled-with Selection" as core principle. Successful isolation of E. coli strains with improved n-butanol and acetate tolerances demonstrated the potential of GREACE as a promising method for strain improvement in biofuels production. © 2013 Luan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Compared to chemical production, microbial production of sugar alcohol has become attractive for its environmental and sustainable pattern. In this study, a potential yeast isolated from soil of Beijing suburbs was identified as Pichia anomala TIB-x229, and its key enzyme of d-arabitol dehydrogenase for microbial production of sugar alcohols was functionally characterized. This yeast could simultaneously produce d-arabitol, xylitol, and/or ribitol from a different ratio of sugar substrates at a high efficiency by bioconversion, and no glucose repression happened when mixed sugars of xylose and glucose were used as the substrates during the bioconversion. This yeast could also efficiently convert complicated feedstock such as xylose mother liquor to d-arabitol, xylitol, and ribitol with 55 % yields. To elucidate the conversion relationship of the sugar alcohols, especially d-arabitol and xylitol, the key d-arabitol dehydrogenase gene from P. anomala was cloned, expressed and purified for further in vitro characterization. The results showed that this d-arabitol dehydrogenase could catalyze arabitol to xylulose further, which is significant for xylitol production from glucose.

84892473970	The transcriptome landscape of Prochlorococcus MED4 and the factors for stabilizing the core genome	Background: Gene gain and loss frequently occurs in the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, a phototroph that numerically dominates tropical and subtropical open oceans. However, little is known about the stabilization of its core genome, which contains approximately 1250 genes, in the context of genome streamlining. Using Prochlorococcus MED4 as a model organism, we investigated the constraints on core genome stabilization using transcriptome profiling. Results: RNA-Seq technique was used to obtain the transcriptome map of Prochlorococcus MED4, including operons, untranslated regions, non-coding RNAs, and novel genes. Genome-wide expression profiles revealed that three factors contribute to core genome stabilization. First, a negative correlation between gene expression levels and protein evolutionary rates was observed. Highly expressed genes were overrepresented in the core genome but not in the flexible genome. Gene necessity was determined as a second powerful constraint on genome evolution through functional enrichment analysis. Third, quick mRNA turnover may increase corresponding proteins' fidelity among genes that were abundantly expressed. Together, these factors influence core genome stabilization during MED4 genome evolution. Conclusions: Gene expression, gene necessity, and mRNA turnover contribute to core genome maintenance during cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus genus evolution. © 2014 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Several algorithms are available to predict the target reactions to be deleted. Most of them apply mixed integer bi-level linear programming (MIBLP) based on metabolic networks, and use duality theory to transform bi-level optimization problem of large-scale MIBLP to single-level programming. However, the validity of the transformation was not proved. Solution of MIBLP depends on the structure of inner problem. If the inner problem is continuous, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) method can be used to reformulate the MIBLP to a single-level one. We adopt KKT technique in our algorithm ReacKnock to attack the intractable problem of the solution of MIBLP, demonstrated with the genome-scale metabolic network model of E. coli for producing various chemicals such as succinate, ethanol, threonine and etc. Compared to the previous methods, our algorithm is fast, stable and reliable to find the optimal solutions for all the chemical products tested, and able to provide all the alternative deletion strategies which lead to the same industrial objective. © 2013 Xu et al.

Escherichia coli has been used as a heterologous host for the production of a variety of natural compounds for many years. In the current study, we engineered synthesis of isobutyryl-CoA and isovaleryl-CoA from glucose in E. coli by integration of the branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex from Streptomyces avermitilis. In the presence of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene, chloramphenicol was converted to both chloramphenicol-3-isobutyrate and chloramphenicol-3-isovalerate by the recombinant E. coli strains, which suggested successful synthesis of isobutyryl-CoA and isovaleryl-CoA. Furthermore, we improved the α-keto acid precursor supply by overexpressing the alsS gene from Bacillus subtilis and the ilvC and ilvD genes from E. coli and thus enhanced the synthesis of short branched-chain acyl-CoAs. By feeding 25 mg/L chloramphenicol, 2.96±0.06 mg/L chloramphenicol-3- isobutyrate and 3.94± 0.06 mg/L chloramphenicol-3-isovalerate were generated by the engineered E. coli strain, which indicated efficient biosynthesis of short branched-chain acyl-CoAs. HPLC analysis showed that the most efficient E. coli strain produced 80.77 ± 3.83 nmol/g wet weight isovaleryl-CoA. To our knowledge, this is the first report of production of short branched-chain acyl-CoAs in E. coli and opens a way to biosynthesize various valuable natural compounds based on these special building blocks from renewable carbon sources. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

Previous studies focused on characterizing the role of these transporters in only a few conditions, including cellulose degradation, and the function of these two transporters is not yet completely understood. In this study, we show that deletion of cdt-2, but not cdt-1, results in growth defects not only on Avicel but also on xylan. cdt-2 can be highly induced by xylan, and this mutant has a xylodextrin consumption defect. Transcriptomic analysis of the cdt-2 deletion strain on Avicel and xylan showed that major cellulase and hemicellulase genes were significantly down-regulated in the cdt-2 deletion strain and artificial over expression of cdt-2 in N. crassa increased cellulase and hemicellulase production. Together, these data clearly show that CDT-2 plays a critical role in hemicellulose sensing and utilization. This is the first time a sugar transporter has been assigned a function in the hemicellulose degradation pathway. Furthermore, we found that the transcription factor XLR-1 is the major regulator of cdt-2, while cdt-1 is primarily regulated by CLR-1. These results deepen our understanding of the functions of both cellodextrin transporters, particularly for CDT-2. Our study also provides novel insight into the mechanisms for hemicellulose sensing and utilization in N. crassa, and may be applicable to other cellulolytic filamentous fungi. © 2014 Cai et al.

84897129361	Discovery of a super-strong promoter enables efficient production of heterologous proteins in cyanobacteria	Cyanobacteria are oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes that play important roles in the global carbon cycle. Recently, engineered cyanobacteria capable of producing various small molecules from CO 2 have been developed. However, cyanobacteria are seldom considered as factories for producing proteins, mainly because of the lack of efficient strong promoters. Here, we report the discovery and verification of a super-strong promoter P cpc560, which contains two predicted promoters and 14 predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Using P cpc560, functional proteins were produced at a level of up to 15% of total soluble protein in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. 6803, a level comparable to that produced in Escherichia coli. We demonstrated that the presence of multiple TFBSs in P cpc560 is crucial for its promoter strength. Genetically transformable cyanobacteria neither have endotoxins nor form inclusion bodies; therefore, P cpc560 opens the possibility to use cyanobacteria as alternative hosts for producing heterogeneous proteins from CO 2 and inorganic nutrients.

84898049901	Transcriptional comparison of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa growing on three major monosaccharides D-glucose, D-xylose and L-arabinose	Background: D-glucose, D-xylose and L-arabinose are the three major monosaccharides in plant cell walls. Complete utilization of all three sugars is still a bottleneck for second-generation cellulolytic bioethanol production, especially for L-arabinose. However, little is known about gene expression profiles during L-arabinose utilization in fungi and a comparison of the genome-wide fungal response to these three major monosaccharides has not yet been reported. Results: Using next-generation sequencing technology, we have analyzed the transcriptome of N. crassa grown on L-arabinose versus D-xylose, with D-glucose as the reference. We found that the gene expression profiles on L-arabinose were dramatically different from those on D-xylose. It appears that L-arabinose can rewire the fungal cell metabolic pathway widely and provoke the expression of many kinds of sugar transporters, hemicellulase genes and transcription factors. In contrast, many fewer genes, mainly related to the pentose metabolic pathway, were upregulated on D-xylose. The rewired metabolic response to L-arabinose was significantly different and wider than that under no carbon conditions, although the carbon starvation response was initiated on L-arabinose. Three novel sugar transporters were identified and characterized for their substrates here, including one glucose transporter GLT-1 (NCU01633) and two novel pentose transporters, XAT-1 (NCU01132), XYT-1 (NCU05627). One transcription factor associated with the regulation of hemicellulase genes, HCR-1 (NCU05064) was also characterized in the present study. Conclusions: We conducted the first transcriptome analysis of Neurospora crassa grown on L-arabinose and performed a comparative analysis with cells grown on D-xylose and D-glucose, which deepens the understanding of the utilization of L-arabinose and D-xylose in filamentous fungi. The dataset generated by this research will be useful for mining target genes for D-xylose and L-arabinose utilization engineering and the novel sugar transportes identified are good targets for pentose untilization and biofuels production. Moreover, hemicellulase production by fungi could be improved by modifying the hemicellulase regulator discovered here. © 2014 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84899071917	Cloning, expression and characterization of a pectate lyase from Paenibacillus sp. 0602 in recombinant Escherichia coli	Background: Biotechnological applications of microbial pectate lyases (Pels) in plant fiber processing are considered as environmentally friendly. As such, they become promising substitutes for conventional chemical degumming process. Since applications of Pels in various fields are widening, it is necessary to explore new pectolytic microorganisms and enzymes for efficient and effective usage. Here, we describe the cloning, expression, characterization and application of the recombinant Pel protein from a pectolytic bacterium of the genus Paenibacillus in Escherichia coli.Results: A Pel gene (pelN) was cloned using degenerate PCR and inverse PCR from the chromosomal DNA of Paenibacillus sp. 0602. The open reading frame of pelN encodes a 30 amino acid signal peptide and a 445 amino acid mature protein belonging to the polysaccharide lyase family 1. The maximum Pel activity produced by E. coli in shake flasks reached 2,467.4 U mL

84900793243	Identification and characterization of a novel alkaline α-amylase Amy703 belonging to a new clade from Bacillus pseudofirmus	Alkaline α-amylases are of great interest in desizing processes and detergent industries. Here, an alkaline α-amylase gene amy703 from an alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus strain was cloned and sequenced. Its encoding product, Amy703, might represent a new clade of α-amylase family, because it shared only 35 % highest identity with all amylases characterized up to date and was not clustered into any subfamilies with amylase activity in glycoside hydrolase family 13. Heterologous expression and characterization of Amy703 showed that it is a metalloenzyme with maximal activity at 40°C and pH 9.0. Its activity was significantly enhanced by 2- and 2.48-fold at the presence of 10 mM Ca

84902543631	Engineering the biosynthesis of novel rhamnolipids in Escherichia coli for enhanced oil recovery	Aims: The interfacial tension of rhamnolipids and their applications in enhanced oil recovery are dependent on their chemical structures and compositions. To improve their performances of interfacial tension and enhanced oil recovery, the engineered strategies were applied to produce novel rhamnolipids with different chemical structures and compositions. Methods and Results: By introducing different key genes for rhamnolipid biosynthesis, Escherichia coli was firstly constructed to produce rhamnolipids that showed different performances in interfacial tension from those from Pseudomonas aeruginosa due to the different fatty acyl compositions. Then, the mutant RhlBs were created by directed evolution and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis and resulted in the production of the novel rhamnolipids with the different performances in interfacial tension as well as enhanced oil recovery. Lastly, computational modelling elucidates that the single amino acid mutation at the position 168 in RhlB would change the volume of binding pocket for substrate and thus affect the selectivity of rhamnolipid formation in E. coli. Conclusions: The novel rhamnolipids that showed the improved performances of interfacial tension and the potential different applications in enhanced oil recovery were successfully produced by engineered E. coli. Significance and Impact of the study: This study proved that the combination of metabolic engineering and protein engineering is an important engineered strategy to produce many novel metabolites in micro-organisms. © 2014 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

84902261117	Three-dimensional structure of an alkaline xylanase Xyn11A-LC from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. SN5 and improvement of its thermal performance by introducing arginines substitutions	The alkaline xylanase Xyn11A-LC from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. SN5 was expressed in E. coli, purified and crystallized. The crystal structure was determined at a resolution of 1.49 Å. Xyn11A-LC has the β-jelly roll structure typical of family 11 xylanases. To improve its thermostability and thermophilicity, a mutant SB3 was constructed by introducing three arginines on the different sides of the protein surface. SB3 increased the optimum temperature by 5 °C. The wild type and SB3 had the half-lives of 22 and 68 min at 65 °C at pH 8.0 (Tris/HCl buffer), respectively. CD spectroscopy revealed that the melting temperature (T

84902287559	Production of lycopene by metabolically-engineered Escherichia coli	Escherichia coli strain CAR001 that produces β-carotene was genetically engineered to produce lycopene by deleting genes encoding zeaxanthin glucosyltransferase (crtX) and lycopene β-cyclase (crtY) from the crtEXYIB operon. The resulting strain, LYC001, produced 10.5 mg lycopene/l (6.5 mg/g dry cell weight, DCW). Modulating expression of genes encoding α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase and transaldolase B within central metabolic modules increased NADPH and ATP supplies, leading to a 76 % increase of lycopene yield. Ribosome binding site libraries were further used to modulate expression of genes encoding 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (dxs) and isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (idi) and the crt gene operon, which improved the lycopene yield by 32 %. The optimal strain LYC010 produced 3.52 g lycopene/l (50.6 mg/g DCW) in fed-batch fermentation. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84907518686	Process optimization of high-level extracellular production of alkaline pectate lyase in recombinant Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)	Eco-effective high-level production of alkaline pectate lyase (PL) is a necessary prerequisite for the application of this enzyme in large-scale industries, such as bioscouring. For this purpose, in this work, a multi-step glycerol feeding strategy based on specific growth rate for high cell density cultivation of recombinant Escherichia coli was first established, which could effectively control cell growth and acetate yield. Next, the effects of induction time, temperature, and inducer concentration on cell growth and extracellular secretory production of recombinant PL were investigated. When induced by IPTG (using either low IPTG concentration at 25. °C or high IPTG concentration at 30. °C), two different extracellular secretion strategies were found to be appropriate for extracellular PL production. On the other hand, when cultivations were induced by mild continuous lactose feeding strategy, the extracellular and total PL activities reached 4478 and 5337. U/mL, respectively, representing the highest PL yield reported to date.

84918768378	Constitutive expression of alkaline β-mannanase in recombinant Pichia pastoris	Alkaline β-mannanase has important applications for specific industrial processes like pulp bleaching and the detergent industry. The low yield of alkaline β-mannanase produced from native microbes such as alkaliphilic Bacillus limits its applications. Pichia pastoris is the most efficient heterologous system to produce alkaline mannanase. However, the previous use of the AOX system required large amount of methanol and sophisticated operation strategy, which are undesirable in large scale production. In this study, we established a safe and simple constitutive expression process for mannanase production in P. pastoris. The mannanase gene was successfully expressed under the control of GAP promoter. Sequential optimization of the constructed strains was also performed including the copy number optimization and co-expression of chaperone genes. A two-stage feeding strategy was then applied for the finally optimized strain. After 96 h fermentation, a production level of 2980 U/mL was finally reached, illustrating the potential of the GAP constitutive expression system for industrial scale preparation of alkaline β-mannanase.

0942265390	An analysis of the proteomic profile for Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis under optimal culture conditions	The genome of Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis is estimated to encode 2588 theoretical proteins. In this study, we have vitalized approximately 46% of the theoretical proteome experimentally using a proteomic strategy that combines three different methods, shotgun digestion plus high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry (shotgun-liquid chromatography (LC)/MS), one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) plus HPLC with ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry (one-dimensional electrophoresis (1DE)-LC/MS), and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis plus matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (2DE-MALDI-TOF-MS). Of the 1200 proteins identified, as few as 76 proteins were globally found by all three approaches, and notably, most of these proteins were in the soluble fraction. However, there were a number of unique proteins detected by one method only, suggesting that our strategy provides a means toward obtaining a comprehensive view of protein expression profile. Proteins from the major metabolic pathways are strongly represented on the map, and a number of these enzymes were identified by more than one proteomic method. Based upon the proteins identified in the present study, we are able to broaden the understanding of how T. tengcongensis survives under high temperature environment, whereas several of its properties can not be fully explained by genome data.

12544256289	Characterization and gene cloning of a novel β-mannanase from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. N16-5	An alkaline β-mannanase was purified to homogeneity from a culture broth of alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. N16-5. The enzyme had optimum activity at pH 9.5 and 70°C. It was composed of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 55 kDa deduced from SDS-PAGE, and its isoelectric point was around pH 4.3. The enzyme efficiently hydrolyzed galactomannan and glucomannan, producing a series of oligosaccharides and monosaccharides. The β-mannanase gene (manA) contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,479 bp, encoding a 32-amino acids signal peptide, and a mature protein of 461 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 50,743 Da. Strain N16-5 ManA, deduced from the manA ORF, exhibited relatively high amino acid similarity to the members of the glycosyl hydrolase family 5. The eight conserved active-site amino acids in family 5 glycosyl hydrolase were found in the deduced amino acid sequence of strain N16-5 ManA. © Springer-Verlag 2004.
