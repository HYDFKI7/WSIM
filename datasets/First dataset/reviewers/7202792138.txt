And the high-performance computer and long-time running of program are the common solutions for pretreatment of huge spatial data in GIS, also in this condition the pretreatment program needs validate, low-memory usage and low-CPU requiring clipping algorithm. An algorithm of clipping general polygon in rectangle grids in GIS is presented in this paper, which is designed for the demand of improving clipping general polygon performance. This algorithm has skipped some repeated operation and some workload of reading raw data and computing intersection point between lines, at one time, it considers the requirement of saving memory. According to the result of algorithm analysis and experiment, it is valid and has better performance in the aspects of memory application, total memory, reading times of spatial data, computing times of intersection points, etc, so the total clipping time of this algorithm is less than common clipping algorithm in GIS, which clips polygon cell by cell in grids.

38049013815	SAREC-GA: A security-aware real-time scheduling algorithm with genetic algorithm	Security requirements of security-critical real-time applications must be met in addition to satisfying timing constraints. However, conventional real-time scheduling algorithms ignore the applications' security requirements. Tao Xie, Xiao Qin et al. have proposed a security-aware scheduling strategy, or SAREC, and scheduling algorithm SAREC-EDF, which integrates security requirements into scheduling for real-time applications. However, there are some disadvantages in his algorithms. The scheduling problem is a maximization optimization problem with constraints, but SAREC-EDF does not compare its solutions in global scope, just like greedy algorithm, as a result, its last result maybe not the best one. In this paper, on the one hand, we originally construct two mathematic models for the real-time scheduling problems considering security requirements. On the other hand, we propose a new security-aware real-time scheduling algorithm based on genetic algorithm (SAREC-GA), which can improve overall security level of the system by up to approximately 25% on the base of SAREC-EDF when real-time requirement is guaranteed. Experiment data and simulated results show the feasibility and availability of the proposed models and method. © 2007 IEEE.

38049059303	Constrained single- and multiple-objective optimization with differential evolution	Most real-world optimization problems are single-or multiple-objective optimization problems with constraints. However, the most common approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the use of penalty functions which require a careful and difficult tuning of the penalty factors. In this paper, we proposed a multi-objective optimization concept to handle constraints. Firstly, we redefine the problems by converting all the constraints into new objective functions. Thus, the problems with m objective functions and n constraints become unconstrained optimization problems with m+n objective functions. Then we could utilize all kinds of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to optimize the redefined problems. In this work a recent multi-objective Differential Evolution (DEMO) was used for multi-objective optimization. In order to evaluate the ability of our method we chose eight famous constrained test functions, including four single-objective test functions (g06, g08, g11 and Gearbox) and four multiple-objective test functions (CONSTR, SRN, TNK and KITA). Experimental results from eight constrained test functions show that the proposed method is capable of successfully optimizing constrained single-and multiple-objective problems. © 2007 IEEE.

38149123373	The geometry optimization of argon atom clusters using differential evolution algorithm	Recently atomic cluster structures have been intensively studied because of their importance in physics, chemistry and material science. However, finding the lowest energy structure, which is the most stable configuration, is NP-hard. Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is a new heuristic approach which mainly has three advantages: finding the true global minimum regardless of the initial parameter values, fast convergence, and using few control parameters. In this paper we describe a new search method that uses differential evolution (DE) algorithm to optimize the geometry of small argon atom clusters. Experimental results show that the exact global optimal configuration of argon clusters with atom number N< 16 can be found in a reasonable computing time, and approximate optimization can also be obtained for clusters with N=30. From their 3-D geometry structures, we can see that their optimal energy structures are highly symmetrical. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

33645026350	Fuzzy support vector machines based on linear clustering	A new Fuzzy Support Vector Machines (FSVMs) based on linear clustering is proposed in this paper. Its concept comes from the idea of linear clustering, selecting the data points near to the preformed hyperplane, which is formed on the training set including one positive and one negative training samples respectively. The more important samples near to the preformed hyperplane are selected by linear clustering technique, and the new FSVMs are formed on the more important data set. It integrates the merit of two kinds of FSVMs. The membership functions are defined using the relative distance between the data points and the preformed hyperplane during the training process. The fuzzy membership decision functions of multi-class FSVMs adopt the minimal value of all the decision functions of two-class FSVMs. To demonstrate the superiority of our methods, the benchmark data sets of machines learning databases are selected to verify the proposed FSVMs. The experimental results indicate that the proposed FSVMs can reduce the training data and running time, and its recognition rate is greater than or equal to that of FSVMs through selecting a suitable linear clustering parameter.

Such problems often arise in scientific research and engineering practice. We presented a general methodology based on evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for the parameter estimation of inverse problems. Giving function class of unknown parameter, genetic algorithms (GA) is used to evolve the optimal coefficient of linear combination of basis function. Without giving the class of parameter function, genetic programming (GP) is used to evolve the appropriate parameter function structure and coefficient such that the identification of parameter is objective and automatically. When applying ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or partial differential equations (PDEs) including unknown parameter to prediction models, the parameter is adaptively calibrated according to the recent observation data such that the prediction is improved by evolutionary computation. We apply this method to the numerical recovery of spatially varying physical parameters in elliptic boundary values problems.

79959395468	Multi-ant colony system for evacuation routing problem with mixed traffic flow	Evacuation routing problem with mixed traffic flow is complex due to the interaction among different types of evacuees. The positive feedback mechanism of single ant colony system may lead to congestion on some optimum routes. Like different ant colony systems in nature, different components of traffic flow compete and interact with each other during evacuation process. In this paper, an approach based on multi-ant colony system was proposed to tackle evacuation routing problem with mixed traffic flow. Total evacuation time is minimized and traffic load of the whole road network is balanced by this approach. The experimental results show that this approach based on multi-ant colony system can obtain better solutions than single ant colony system and solve mixed traffic flow evacuation problem with reasonable routing plans. © 2010 IEEE.

84868574454	Hybrid particle filter algorithm using multi features for video target tracking	Video target tracking is an essential problem in the field of computer vision. Particle filters have been proved to be very useful in target tracking for non-linear and non-Gaussian estimation problems. However, for the target tracking in complex background, it is often difficult to achieve robust tracking by using single target feature information. To solve this problem, this paper presents a hybrid particle filter algorithm using multi features for video target tracking. The algorithm integrates multiple features into particle filter to get better observation results, and then automatically adjusts the weight value of each feature according to the current tracking environment. In order to describe the target movement well, the method automatically adjusts the transfer range of particles according to the target speed changes, thus the particles can reach high likelihood region, which reduces the target lost phenomenon caused by speed changes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the tracking performance in complicated real scenarios.

The present work proposes a partial order relation and lattice computing to deal with the aforementioned issue. A hyperspherical granular computing classification algorithm (HSGrCCA) is developed in the framework of fuzzy lattices. HSGrCCA computes a fuzzy inclusion relation between two hyperspherical granules using an inclusion measure function based on a linear positive valuation function induced by the radius of a hyperspherical granule. A fuzzy lattice is formed on the hyperspherical granule set by the dilation operator, erosion operator, and partial order relation. HSGrCCA is trained by introducing control parameter ρ of the hyperspherical granule size and then obtains changeable hyperspherical granules. Experimental results on machine learning benchmark data sets show that the proposed algorithm increases the generalization ability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84872166240	Multitarget tracking of pedestrians in video sequences based on particle filters	Video target tracking is a critical problem in the field of computer vision. Particle filters have been proven to be very useful in target tracking for nonlinear and non-Gaussian estimation problems. Although most existing algorithms are able to track targets well in controlled environments, it is often difficult to achieve automated and robust tracking of pedestrians in video sequences if there are various changes in target appearance or surrounding illumination. To surmount these difficulties, this paper presents multitarget tracking of pedestrians in video sequences based on particle filters. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the detection, the algorithm firstly obtains target regions in training frames by combining the methods of background subtraction and Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and then establishes discriminative appearance model by generating patches and constructing codebooks using superpixel and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features in those target regions. During the process of tracking, the algorithm uses the similarity between candidates and codebooks as observation likelihood function and processes severe occlusion condition to prevent drift and loss phenomenon caused by target occlusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm improves the tracking performance in complicated real scenarios. © 2012 Hui Li et al.

A hyperbox granule is represented by a vector including a beginning point and an end point. The inconsistency between the partial ordering relation in vector space and the partial ordering relation in hyperbox granule space is analyzed and then eliminated by the order-preserving function. The fuzzy inclusion relation between two hyperbox granules is formed by nonlinear positive valuation function and the order-preserving function between the lattice and its dual lattice. The join operator and decomposition operator between two granules are designed to achieve the granules with different granularity. The algebraic system which is composed of hyperbox granule set, fuzzy inclusion relation and the operators between two granules is proved as fuzzy lattice. Hyperbox granular computing classifiers are formed based on fuzzy lattice, and verified by classification problems on machine learning dataset. The experimental results show that hyperbox granular computing classifiers have a generalization ability comparable to that of fuzzy lattice reasoning classifiers with less number of hyperbox granules.

0345529106	A New Genetic Programming Approach in Symbolic Regression	Genetic Programming (GP) has been applied to symbolic regression problem for a long time. The symbolic regression is to discover a function that can fit a finite set of sample data. These sample data can be guided by a simple function, which is continuous and smooth, but in a complex system, the sample data can be produced by a discontinuous or non-smooth function. When conventional GP is applied to such complex system's regression, it gets poor performance. This paper proposed a new GP representation and algorithm that can be applied to both continuous function's regression and discontinuous function's regression. The proposed approach is able to identify both the sub-functions and the discontinuity points simultaneously. The numerical experimental results show that the new GP is able to obtain higher success rate, higher convergence rate and better solutions than conventional GP in such complex system's regression.

84896911440	Finite Markov chain analysis of classical differential evolution algorithm	Theoretical analyses of algorithms are important to understand their search behaviors and develop more efficient algorithms. Compared with the plethora of works concerning the empirical study of the differential evolution (DE), little theoretical research has been done to investigate the convergence properties of DE so far. This paper focuses on theoretical researches on the convergence of DE and presents a convergent DE algorithm. First of all, it is proved that the classical DE cannot converge to the global optimal set with probability 1 by using the property that it cannot escape from a local optimal set. Inspired by the characteristics of the elitist genetic algorithm, this paper proposed a modified DE to overcome the disadvantage. The proposed algorithm employs two operators that assist it in escaping from a local optimal set and enhance the diversity of the population. And it is then verified that the proposed algorithm is capable of converging to global optima with probability 1. The theoretical research of this paper is undertaken in a finite discrete set, and the analysis tool used is the Markov chain. The numerical experiments are conducted on a deceptive function and a set of benchmark functions. The experimental results support the theoretical analyses on the convergence performances of the classical and modified DE algorithm. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84899441851	A convergent differential evolution algorithm with hidden adaptation selection for engineering optimization	Many improved differential Evolution (DE) algorithms have emerged as a very competitive class of evolutionary computation more than a decade ago. However, few improved DE algorithms guarantee global convergence in theory. This paper developed a convergent DE algorithm in theory, which employs a self-adaptation scheme for the parameters and two operators, that is, uniform mutation and hidden adaptation selection (haS) operators. The parameter self-adaptation and uniform mutation operator enhance the diversity of populations and guarantee ergodicity. The haS can automatically remove some inferior individuals in the process of the enhancing population diversity. The haS controls the proposed algorithm to break the loop of current generation with a small probability. The breaking probability is a hidden adaptation and proportional to the changes of the number of inferior individuals. The proposed algorithm is tested on ten engineering optimization problems taken from IEEE CEC2011. © 2014 Zhongbo Hu et al.

84901755289	Subspace clustering mutation operator for developing convergent differential evolution algorithm	Many researches have identified that differential evolution algorithm (DE) is one of the most powerful stochastic real-parameter algorithms for global optimization problems. However, a stagnation problem still exists in DE variants. In order to overcome the disadvantage, two improvement ideas have gradually appeared recently. One is to combine multiple mutation operators for balancing the exploration and exploitation ability. The other is to develop convergent DE variants in theory for decreasing the occurrence probability of the stagnation. Given that, this paper proposes a subspace clustering mutation operator, called SC-qrtop. Five DE variants, which hold global convergence in probability, are then developed by combining the proposed operator and five mutation operators of DE, respectively. The SC-qrtop randomly selects an elite individual as a perturbation's center and employs the difference between two randomly generated boundary individuals as a perturbation's step. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations demonstrate that SC-qrtop prefers to search in the orthogonal subspace centering on the elite individual. Experimental results on CEC2005 benchmark functions indicate that all five convergent DE variants with SC-qrtop mutation outperform the corresponding DE algorithms. © 2014 Zhongbo Hu et al.
