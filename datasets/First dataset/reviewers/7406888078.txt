0032090717	Multiple-cell square-type layout design for output transistors in submicron CMOS technology to save silicon area	A new multiple-cell square-type layout design is proposed to realize the large-dimension output transistors for submicron low-voltage CMOS ICs. By using this layout design, the layout area of CMOS output buffers can be effectively reduced 30-40% with respect to the traditional finger-type layout. The drain-to-bulk parasitic capacitance of the output transistors is also reduced 40% by this square-type layout. Experimental results in a 0.6 μm CMOS process have shown that the maximum driving (sinking) capability per unit layout area of a CMOS output buffer realized by the proposed multiple-cell square-type layout is improved 54% (34%) more than that by the traditional finger-type layout.

2442598098	Analysis of microwave MESFET power amplifiers for digital wireless communications systems	The analysis of microwave MESFET power amplifiers (PAs) for digital wireless communications by using the hybrid Volterra-series method is presented in this paper. Compared with the traditional approach in the pure frequency-domain operation, the hybrid method has the advantage of fast computation for the continuous spectral signals with the same accuracy. The major modification is the equivalent baseband formulations in the time domain for the digital modulation signal, and the frequency-domain treatment with the nonlinear system via Volterra-series expansion. The MESFET two-dimensional current model is utilized and detailed current expressions are given to account for the gate-drain cross-term effects, while the nonlinear capacitors are also considered to describe the MESFET nonlinear characteristics completely. Circuit-level simulation yields the output modulation signal parameters with the measured data confirmation. System performance degradations due to nonlinear distortions of the MESFET PA are also performed for the communication link with the additive white Gaussian noise channel model. These results would be very useful in PA designs for digital wireless communications systems.

We utilize additional TL sections for the series/shunt standards to acquire their parasitic elements directly, as well as other calibration parameters including TL propagation constant, series impedance, and shunt admittance, by two more determining equations in the self-calibration procedure. This approach relaxes the constraint on the series/shunt standards which may not satisfy the lossy TL assumption in the parasitic evaluations. The proposed method is examined by the GaAs microstrip test structure with verifications of the plain LST and the thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibrations. © 2012 IEEE.

84869496152	On the temperature-dependent characteristics of a Pd/InAlAs based electroless-plating gate metamorphic heterostructure field-effect transistor (MHFET)	In this work, the interesting temperature-dependent characteristics of a Pd/InAlAs based metamorphic heterostructure field-effect transistor (MHFET) with an electroless plating (EP)-gate approach are demonstrated and studied. Based on the low-energy and low-temperature chemical deposition, the EP technique can reduce the thermal damage and disordered-states to form a better metal-semiconductor (MS) interface. The EP-gate device shows better performance including higher turn-on voltage (0.978 V), lower gate leakage current (2.1 μA/mm), higher Schottky barrier height (0.742 eV), lower ideality factor (1.15), higher transconductance (272.4 mS/mm), higher drain saturation current (420.2 mA/mm), wider I

84871948896	Generalization and reduction of line-series-shunt calibration for broadband GaAs and CMOS on-wafer scattering parameter measurements	This paper presents generalization and reduction of the line-series-shunt (LST) calibration technique, including generic parasitic treatments on the series/shunt standards and number reduction of calibration standards, for broadband GaAs and CMOS on-wafer scattering parameter ($S$- parameter) measurements. The series/shunt standards are modified with additional transmission-line (TL) sections on both the left and right sides to directly solve the five calibration parameters, namely, TL propagation constant, series impedance, shunt admittance, series parasitic admittance, and shunt parasitic impedance. This approach relaxes the constraint on the series/shunt standards that may not satisfy the plain lossy TL assumption in the parasitic evaluations. The calibration can be further reduced by only two standards if the lossy TL models for the series/shunt standards are satisfied. These points are examined by a microstrip test structure built on GaAs and CMOS technologies, with verification of an independent thru-reflect-line calibration. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

84874436467	Applying line-series-shunt calibration to one-tier on-wafer device de-embedding up to millimeter waves	In this article, a one-tier on-wafer device de-embedding methodology up to millimeter wave regions is presented by using the line-series-shunt calibration technique. All the calibration and de-embedding processes are accomplished without the needs of impedance-standard-substrate (ISS), which defines the reference impedance in the conventional on-wafer measurements. Three on-chip standards, namely a section of transmission line (TL), a series resistor, and a shunt resistor, are utilized to perform the calibration where the characteristics of the standards need not to be known in advance and can be evaluated through the self-calibration procedure. The proposed method is examined by the GaAs 0.15 μm pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (pHEMT) device in the measured frequencies from 2 GHz to 90 GHz. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84884279759	Broadband complementary metal-oxide semiconductor interconnection transmission line measurements with generalized probe transition characterization and verification of multiline thru-reflect-line calibration	This paper presents extraction techniques and measurement results for broadband complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) interconnection transmission line (TL) measurements with generalized probe transition characterization and verification of multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration. Initially, the probe transition is represented by a transmission matrix instead of the conventional shunt/series model, with detailed parameter evaluation procedures using measured data from two lines that are twice in length. Subsequently, an additional long TL that fully exhibits the TL characteristics at low frequencies is characterized, whereas the matrix manipulations with the other two TL measured data are adapted for high-frequency regions to avoid the ill-conditioned problem. Consequently, broadband characterization for CMOS TL is achieved in a cost-effective manner. With an additional reflect test structure, the multiline TRL calibration can be performed as well for verification. The proposed method is examined by thin-film microstrip lines using CMOS 90-nm one-poly/nine-metal technology with measurement frequencies from 2 to 110 GHz. © 2013 IEEE.
