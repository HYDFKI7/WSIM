1642586310	A straightness measurement system using a single-mode fiber-coupled laser module	In this paper, a quite simple and novel straightness measurement system is proposed. The laser beam from a single-mode fiber-coupled laser module is highly stable, and can be used as the reference line for straightness measurements of any mechanical system. A corner retro-reflector is used as the moving target in the system in order to sense the straightness error and to reflect laser beam from measurement head back to it. In this way, there is no cable connection in the moving target, which is necessary for straightness measurements in workshop. At the same time, relationship between voltage output from a quadrant photodiode detector and its displacement was analyzed, and the theoretical analysis shows a good consistence with practical measurement results, which gives a way to enlarge the measurement range of the system. Comparative results of straightness measurement with a dual frequency laser interferometer were given, and repeatability with one micrometer at the distance of 1 m was gotten by the system. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A simple method of suppression of laser drift caused by air turbulence is put forward in the paper. With corner retro-reflector as position detector, the linearity error caused by reflection light of the corner retro-reflector is detected by a quadrant detector. 2-D position-sensitive detector and a lens are used to monitor angular drift caused by air turbulence. Experimental results show that the additional position error induced by air turbulence can be reduced by about 75%.

2342540348	A new method for automatically measuring geometric parameters of wheel-sets by laser	How to automatically and effectively measure geometric parameters and defects of train wheel-sets is a key problem in the maintenance of wheelsets. Currently, there are several methods for this kind of measurements. However, all these methods cannot meet the requirements of high accuracy, low cost, and short measurement periods at the same time. A quite simple and novel method for measuring geometric parameters and defects of wheelsets was proposed in this paper. Most key geometric parameters, such as diameters at any given point of the tread, flange thickness, flange height, rim thickness, rim width, wheel flats, and distance between internal faces etc., can be easily obtained by use of five sets of parallelogram mechanisms together with laser transducers. Wheel-sets are dragged simply by a chain to pass through the measurement system when the measurement results are done, which has totally changed the situation that a measurement platform was required to support a wheelset and makes it rotate in order to take measurements. Methods to calibrate the measurement errors of the system are also discussed, and some in-situ measurement results are given. Experimental results show that the measurement uncertainty within 0.1mm can be reached by the developed system.

26644467923	Study of the method for measuring four-degree-of-freedom geometric errors of a linear stage	A novel method for measuring four-degree-of-freedom geometric errors of a linear stage is put forward. A single-mode fiber-coupled laser module is used, and the laser beam from this laser module is highly stable, and can be used as the reference line for straightness error and angular error measurements.

0034430612	In-situ measurements of large external diameters by a heterodyne laser interferometer	A laser heterodyne interferometer has been widely used for a long time in industry, and it has advantages of both large measurement range and high accuracy. So, how to directly use this highly precise laser interferometer for measuring dimensions of large-scale workpieces, especially large diameters, is a target to be pursued. Due to the difficulties of aiming at and positioning the measured points in the measurements of large workpieces, this problem has not been solved up to now. Here, a novel and very simple method of aiming at and positioning the measured points in the dimension measurement of a large-scale workpiece by a single laser beam is put forward, and high-precision measurements of large dimensions can be realized by a commercial available laser heterodyne interferometer.

84861586139	Digital shearography with in situ phase shift calibration	Precise measurement of the spatial derivative of displacement using digital shearography depends on well-calibrated phase shifts. However, due to time drift or a change in the position of the phase shifter, the previously calibrated results may not be applicable for the measurements. In this paper, we introduce a Michelson-interferometer-based digital shearographic setup, with an in situ phase shift calibration, that precisely measures the displacement derivatives. For the optical arrangement, a small number of optical parts are introduced into the existing Michelson interferometer to carry out the in situ calibration of the phase shifter. The calibration can be carried out anytime without changing the optical arrangement. This feature easily recalibrates the digital shearography, eliminating the influence of the phase shift error. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84877204303	Precision measurement of deformation using a self-calibrated digital speckle pattern interferometry (DSPI)	A self-calibrating phase-shifting technique using a Michelson Interferometer is presented to measure phase distribution more accurately in Digital Speckle Pattern Interferometry (DSPI). DSPI is a well-established technique for the determination of whole field deformation via quantitatively measuring the phase distribution of speckle interferograms that use the phase shifting technique. In the phase shifting technique, the phase distribution in a speckle interferogram is quantitatively determined by recording multiple intensity images (usually four images) in which a constant phase shift, e.g. 90 degrees, is introduced between each consecutive image. A precise phase determination is greatly dependent on the accuracy of the phase shift introduced. The popular methods to minimize the error resulting from inaccurate phase shift use various algorithms and need to record five or eight images (rather than four images). This requires a higher demand on system stabilization which increases measurement difficulty. Moreover, these methods are passive. In this paper, we present an active feedback control method to minimize the error induced by inaccurate phase shift. It utilizes a Michelson Interferometer for feedback and controlling. The Michelson Interferometer is integrated into the DSPI system and shares a common optical path. When the optical path length of the reference arm in the DSPI is changed by a piezoelectric transducer or environmental disturbance, the output of Michelson Interferometer will be changed accordingly. The output of Michelson Interferometer acts as a feedback and then controls the piezoelectric transducer. Thus the phase shift is stabilized by the embedded Michelson Interferometer. An experiment is conducted and the results are presented in this paper. Copyright © 2010 SAE International.

In this method a mirrored Nd:YAG crystal in a circular disk shape is made into an all-internal cavity laser. Once diametral compression force is applied, due to intracavity Photoelastic effect, the single laser frequency is split in two. Through measuring the beat frequency of the split frequencies, the relative stress-optic coefficient and internal stresses in the Nd: YAG crystal can be determined according to the proportional relationship. In our experiment the measured value of the stress-optic coefficient, C<inf>111</inf> = 1.27 × l0<sup>-12</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/N, is close to the theoretical value; the principal stress difference at the center of the Nd:YAG crystal was also determined. The optical path retardation resolution is approximately 1.5 x l0<sup>-8</sup> λ, and correspondingly the principal stress difference resolution is approximately 5 Pa The resolution is approximately 5-8 orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional methods, therefore even very small residual stresses can be easily determined with this method.

So combining with optical communication technology, a new optical fiber displacement measurement system with multi-channel is proposed. Based on the principle of reflective light intensity modulation, light of the single laser source is modulated by LiNbO3 electro-optical crystal. The modulated light, via a 3-Port circulator, is injected into a 1 × n optical switch quickly, different measuring channels, measuring channel and reference channel can be switched alternately by the optical switch, then the light is injected to a common photo detector and lock-in amplifier circuit, this can avoid the parameter inconsistent of multi-processing circuits and reduce the cost. Voltage of the output signal is directly proportional to the reflective light intensity and then converted into digital form by an A/D module. The digital signal is processed by software to get the final measured displacement. The common reference channel is adopted to revise the variation of the light source. Stability of the system is so as to be improved. The experimental results show that the resolution of the system is 0.1 μm, repeatability is up to 0.5%.

77952650293	Signal integration algorithm and system validation in the frame-type gauge-alignment measurement system	The accurate measurement results of the gauge and alignment were achieved by integrating the output signals (left and right gauge offset, left and right profile offset) of the image sensor, the output signals of the alignment accelerometer and the output track inclination signal of the carbody inertial platform. The integration algorithm of track alignment was deduced theoretically. The response of the alignment accelerometer installed in the center of the gauge measuring beam was corrected by rotation and gravity amendment, and then convoluted with the triangular window function to get the second-order difference of the gauge measuring beam transverse displacement. Finally the right and left alignment values were obtained through filtering and quadratic integral. Through the design of the analog low-pass filter and the corresponding digital filter, it is realized that the amplitude-frequency response of acceleration filter has nothing to do with the speed of the track inspection car and the inspection accuracy of the system is ensured. The measured displacement by the alignment accelerometer and the measured displacement by the gauge system are compared to verify correctness of the measurement principle and system integration algorithm. The static verification and field test results show that the frame-type gauge-alignment measurement system has high detection precision, stable performance and the low failure rate.

79959816329	A novel laser triangulation sensor with wide dynamic range	Laser triangulation sensors suffer from the varied reflected light intensity which is due to the different object surface reflection characteristics. This varied reflected light intensity causes asymmetry of light spot shape, shifting of light spot center, and so on. This condition decreases the accuracy of measurement. Furthermore, it causes the linear CCD inside the sensor to go out of dynamic range, which is called blooming. Unlike plane CCD, linear CCD shows an asymmetry overflow phenomenon when blooming occurs. This phenomenon will limit the dynamic range and decrease the accuracy of laser triangulation sensor that is based on the linear CCD. However, we found the leading edge of light spot image on CCD array kept stable while scattering light intensity varied and the center of the light spot image shifted. Thus we designed a novel triangulation sensor which used the leading edge to indicate the location of light spot on the CCD, rather than using the center of light spot. This novel sensor overcomes the influences from the blooming of linear CCD and then has both wide dynamic range and high accuracy regardless of different surface character. Finally, an experiment was done to demonstrate the advantage of this sensor as compared to a traditional laser triangulation sensor. © 2011 SAE International.

The change of the intersection angle directly decreases the mapping accuracy. Comparing with the existing inverse compensation method by ground control points, on-orbit intersection angle monitoring method is the real-time and most direct solution of the above problems, and it is also the key technology of photogrammetry without ground control points. But theoretically up to 36 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) need to be monitored simultaneously, it is hard to realize on the orbit. So a mathematical model of the whole mapping camera containing all DoF was established and the complete intersection angle expression was derived. Further reduction of DoF was carried out based on the analysis of the impact of various parameters and a simplified intersection angle expression was obtained. The reasonableness of this simplification was verified by the simulation. In the variation range [0, 200 μm/(″)] of all DoF, simplification error was less than 0.05″. The analysis results show that to monitor the intersection angle of three-line-array mapping camera, only five critical degrees of freedom of the CCD and lens need to be focused on. Then the complication of the system was greatly decreased and on-orbit monitoring system becomes feasible.

DIC measurement system includes hardware and software system. The former is the speckle image acquisition system, the latter are speckle image analysis algorithm and implementation procedures.
