28244467417	Multi-modal function optimization with the ZEDS (zoomed evolutionary dual strategy) algorithm	This article introduces a new evolutionary algorithm for multi-modal function optimization called ZEDS (zoomed evolutionary dual strategy). ZEDS employs a two-step, zoomed (global to local), evolutionary approach. In the first (global) step, an improved 'GT algorithm' is employed to perform a global recombinatory search that divides the search space into niches according to the positions of its approximate solutions. In the second (local) step, a 'niche evolutionary strategy' performs a local search in the niches obtained from the first step, which is repeated until acceptable solutions are found. The ZEDS algorithm was applied to some challenging problems with good results, as shown in this article.

33846267704	Precise texture modeling with 3D laser scanning	Extremely precise texture modeling of complex 3D objects is a significant problem worth of much research. Comparing the laser scanning technology and the digital photogrammetry with their combination results, the optimal solution is the fusion of the data. Surveying points are used to model the main shapes while laser scanning captured the fine details. Photogrammetry is used to register the texture images with the geometry and produce ortho-texture. This paper explains a reliable method based on Direct Linear Transformation (DLT) and ortho-rectification method to model 3D objects combined with 3D laser scanning data and high-resolution image data.

35148818727	An automatic method for generating affine moment invariants	Affine moment invariants are important if one wants to recognize the surface of a plane in three dimensions when the orientation of the plane is not known beforehand and only two-dimensional information is available. The notion of generating function is introduced as a simple and straightforward way to derive various affine invariants. By this notion, we can get the explicit construction of much more affine moment invariants. Based on this conclusion, a large set of invariant polynomials can be generated automatically and immediately by the algorithm we have designed.

37249049863	Biological inspired global descriptor for shape matching	Shape description is the precondition for shape matching and retrieval. The more robust and stable primitives to describe shapes are global topological properties, but obtaining global topological properties is still an obstacle in computer vision. Motivated by the difference sensitivity of short-range connection in biology vision, we present a novel global descriptor to describe the entire topology of simple closed 2D shape in this paper. We employ two novel strategies - the zigzag rule, which approximates shape to an elaborate polygonal curve, and cost function which combines global configurations as well as local information of the line stimulations as our punishments. With these two key steps the descriptor is robust to translation, scaling and rotation. Experimental results show the model gain good performance on matching and retrieval for silhouettes. Even for images with occlusion the result is excellent and reasonable. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

The traditional method is to register the point-clouds from different views one by one and gain the whole landscape of point-cloud in the same coordinate system. Because of the existence of noise from laser device and the influence of accumulative errors from register work, the method mentioned above is difficult to realize the accurately register. For improving the reliability of the landscape model, a method is introduced that makes the sphere target as the restrictive conditions in the point-cloud register work, and simultaneity importing planar target having absolute coordinate for transforming the whole point-cloud model to a geodetic coordinate.

70449645494	Historical relics visualization by fusing terrestrial laser point-clouds and aerial orthophoto	There are many large-scale historical relics in China's stone-desert district, all this sorts relics are threatening by wind deflation. For documenting the cultural heritage in detail and avoiding a long working time in formidable desert conditions, we need an accurate and fast way to record the relics' 3D information. Laser scanners offer various applications on conservation of cultural heritage in recent years, such as static surveying, precise modeling and visualization for data acquiring purpose. Point clouds generated by terrestrial laser scanner and aerial image both are valuable data sources for the reconstruction of objects'3D models. This study exploits an approach for recording relic's datum by long-range terrestrial laser scanner (Optech ILRIS-3D) and fusing the scan data with gray information for visualization tasks. As a result of obtaining full scene needs several scans, we transform every scan individually into one global reference frame for decreasing the accumulative errors of point-clouds registration of common ICP approaches, and build 3D point-clouds model of historical relics by this way. For the purpose to add texture information on the point-clouds model, we consider using the approach by fussing the corresponding aerial orthophoto with the model because the objects have very similar texture information in desert.

This model error may cause wrong results if the traditional parametric model is used. In order to solve this problem, Semi-parametric model, based on parametric model, is implemented in this article. Semiparametric model introduces a non-parametric component to describe the uncertainties in the observation data and their influences. Both parametric and non-parametric unknowns are solved by penalized least squares. Testing results indicate, that in the existence of observation uncertainties, Semi-parametric model can effectively isolate model error, thereby making it a better approach than parametric model. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

We use the prior combined with bottom-up edge information to produce the final grouping result. Our contribution lies in two aspects: one is the novel distance transform saves much searching space; the other is introducing shape manifold in verifying candidates of grouping. Experiments show our method achieves considerable accuracy in occlusion and background clutter.

Then the selection method of TDICCD integration stage during linear vibration and low frequency sine vibration with no perceptible image quality degradation is researched. The result shows that in the condition of no perceptible image quality degradation, as linear vibration velocity increase, the maximum allowable integration stage decreases. In the same low frequency sine vibration period, the maximum allowable integration stage decreases if the amplitude increases.

84883589848	Research on feasibility of satellite on-orbit flutter	Satellite on-orbit imaging is affected by satellite micro-vibrations, which concern imaging quality on-orbit and earth positioning. In order to detect image motion caused by satellite on-orbit flutter effectively, it can be acquired by fast small matrix CCD (Charge-Coupled Device, CCD), by which the image is generated. The image motion can be calculated by SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform, SIFT) match between reference and simulation images firstly, and then error detection with RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus, RANSAC), and lastly with image motion model. The experimental based on IKONOS satellite data proves that the method is feasible.

84883590900	Target design and manufacture for MWIR test field calibration	The influence to IR imaging is analyzed by both emission factors and reflection factors of IR radiation, and the problem of low contrast with traditional target is overcomed by the infrared emissivity differences of different materials and specular reflection principle. Thus, the design and instructions for the new target are proposed considering the factors of shape and size of targets and the shooting conditions of integral time, ambient light and temperature. The experiments show that the combination of the two materials, linoleum and tin platinum, is the best choice to manufacture the target. Thus, the target images with high contrast can be obtained under appropriate conditions, and accurate geometric calibration can be achieved.

84888613177	Geometric processing for remote sensing satellite images using the semi-parametric estimation	Given the existing limitations of the parametric model on processing satellite images, this article proposes a new method for satellite image geometric processing based on the semi-parametric model. Stereo positioning by a rigid sensor and RFM models were tested using SPOT-5 and IKONOS images. Experimental results reveal that for SPOT-5 images with no control point, the semi-parametric model is better than parametric model in most cases, while for IKONOS images the position errors of planar points in the semi-parametric model is almost as great as that of parametric model. However, the elevation results from the semi-parametric model is better than that of parametric model.

84891327560	Building of rigorous geometric processing model based on line-of-sight vector of ZY-3 imagery	A rigorous geometric processing model for ZY-3 satellite images based on image-forming principles for three-line array sensors equipped in ZY-3 was built using satellite state data such as the line-of-sight angle. The validation results show that positional accuracy was not good when satellite state data and a rigorous geometric processing model was directly applied without processing. This was caused by errors created when obtaining satellite state data such as the line-of-sight angle and sensor position. In order to decrease original system errors in satellite orbital position and attitude angles, a modified model based on the line-of-sight vector was introduced to modify these system errors. After the processing, positonal accuracy in flat areas was more precise than 3 meters even when only 3 control points were included in x-y directions.

84891533915	Multi-objective optimal dispatch of power system with wind power based on improved particle swarm algorithm	With the increase of its proportion in power system, wind power not only brings economic and environmental benefits but also the potential security risks due to its fluctuation and uncertainty. In order to take the potential security risks into account, an environmental/economic/safe static dispatch (EESD) model of power system with wind power is built. A new multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm with standby selection and micro variation is proposed to solve the model. Two cases with and without wind power are simulated with the standard IEEE-30 system. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84910134670	Application of optical flow dynamic texture in land use/cover change detection	In the present study, a novel change detection approach for high resolution remote sensing images is proposed based on the optical flow dynamic texture (OFDT), which could achieve the land use & land cover change information automatically with a dynamic description of ground-object changes. This paper describes the ground-object gradual change process from the principle using optical flow theory, which breaks the ground-object sudden change hypothesis in remote sensing change detection methods in the past. As the steps of this method are simple, it could be integrated in the systems and software such as Land Resource Management and Urban Planning software that needs to find ground-object changes. This method takes into account the temporal dimension feature between remote sensing images, which provides a richer set of information for remote sensing change detection, thereby improving the status that most of the change detection methods are mainly dependent on the spatial dimension information. In this article, optical flow dynamic texture is the basic reflection of changes, and it is used in high resolution remote sensing image support vector machine post-classification change detection, combined with spectral information. The texture in the temporal dimension which is considered in this article has a smaller amount of data than most of the textures in the spatial dimensions. The highly automated texture computing has only one parameter to set, which could relax the onerous manual evaluation present status. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated with the 2011 and 2012 QuickBird datasets covering Duerbert Mongolian Autonomous County of Daqing City, China. Then, the effects of different optical flow smooth coefficient and the impact on the description of the ground-object changes in the method are deeply analyzed. The experiment result is satisfactory, with an 87.29% overall accuracy and an 0.8507 Kappa index, and the method achieves better performance than the post-classification change detection methods using spectral information only.

84920729071	A new image quality assessment model based on the gradient information	In order to evaluate the quality of the distorted image, it is necessary to calculate the similarity degree between the distorted image and the original image. By integrating gradient magnitude and gradient phase of image with structural similarity(SSIM), this paper proposed a new image quality assessment model-gradient similarity (GSIM), and the image quality assessment algorithm based on this model. Compared with the SSIM model and the Gradient-based model, this new model not only includes luminance, contrast and structure of image, but more important lies in that it adds gradient phase information on the new model. The result of experiments, through evaluating 982 distorted images in the LIVE database and 924 remote sensing images compression, shows that this new model is superior to traditional models of MSE, PSNR, SSIM and the Gradient-based model. This new model, contrast with traditional model of SSIM, can find better solutions to the problem of objective assessment on seriously distorted images inconsistent with the subjective perception, and also the problem of the mixing evaluation effectiveness relatively worse to multiple types distorted images. Therefore, this new model can truly reflect the quality of the visual perception of the distorted image with higher assessment reliability.

84924408807	Automatic texture mapping with an omnidirectional camera mounted on a vehicle towards large scale 3D city models	Today high resolution panoramic images with competitive quality have been widely used for rendering in some commercial systems. However the potential applications such as mapping, augmented reality and modelling which need accurate orientation information are still poorly studied. Urban models can be quickly obtained from aerial images or LIDAR, however with limited quality or efficiency due to low resolution textures and manual texture mapping work flow. We combine an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with the traditional Structure from Motion (SFM) method without any prior information based on a general camera model which can handle various kinds of omnidirectional and other kind of single perspective image sequences even with unconnected or weakly connected frames. The orientation results is then applied to mapping the textures from panoramas to the existing building models obtained from aerial photogrammetry. It turns out to largely improve the quality of the models and the efficiency of the modelling procedure.
