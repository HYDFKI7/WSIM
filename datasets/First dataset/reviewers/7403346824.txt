The main factors influencing the quality of friction stitch welding include stud rotating speed and axial force applied. There exist great differences from other friction welding processes in forming mechanism, such as friction plug welding, friction surfacing, friction plunge welding and soon. Because friction stitch welding can accomplish good bonding properties under the condition of dry or wet environment, it has great application potentials in material forming process, especially in the case of underwater repair for steel structure.

45449088526	Thermal mechanical coupling analysis on initial period of FHPP in friction stitch welding	The fundamental forming process of friction stitch welding is friction hydro pillar processing, which is the key process that effects the quality of Friction Stitch Welding. A three-dimensional thermal mechanical coupling model of FHPP process was established by using finite element code MSC. Marc. The calculated results with material coupling of Q235-Q235 indicate that the temperature distribution on the friction surface has a tendency to rise gradually from the inside to outside on radial direction during welding process, while the contact pressure distribution decreases gradually. With the increase of rotary speed, the temperature is remarkably increased while the material doesn't illustrate obvious plastic deformation, but the effect is relatively weak with the increase of temperature. When material in the contact zone illustrates plastic strain at high temperatures, increasing axial force is more effective for increasing temperature and inducing large deformation.

77954021281	Two-dimensional numerical simulation of friction hydro pillar processing by computational fluid dynamics	A two-dimensional axisymmetric model of friction hydro pillar processing (FHPP) was established base on Gambit software. Using the commercial computational fluid dynamics software Fluent, the numerical simulation of plastic metal flow pattern was carried out in steady phase of FHPP. While keeping the other parameters constantly during the process of numerical simulation, the velocity field and static pressure field distribution change of ideal metal plastic fluid during the forming process were analyzed by changing only one critical parameter respectively, such as the radial clearance between metal stud and the base hole, the material viscosity, the rotary speed of metal stud, the feed rate of metal stud and the bottom shape of the base hole. The result show that the static pressure distribution of plastic metal is affected remarkably by the feed rate (i.e. the axial force) and the material viscosity of metal stud, and has little to do with the rotary speed and the radial clearance. Although the feed rate and the radial clearance have little influence on the velocity distribution of plastic metal, the effect of rotary speed is relatively remarkable, especially for the material neighboring to the wall of the velocity inlet and nearby the metal stud. The flow condition of the plastic metal material can be improved by changing the bottom shape of the base hole, which can also reveal the reason why there exist some defects at the bottom of the hole. The above-mentioned research can provide some guidance to the future experimental study adopting appropriate parametric combination, and can also lay solid foundation for the future numerical simulation by thermo-mechanical coupling.

79955781068	Influence of the bar shape on the welding quality of friction hydro pillar processing	Traditional underwater arc welding methods, for example, TIG and MIG, are generally expensive and complex to implement under water. Besides, the welding quality decreases significantly with the increase of depth of water. So a new-style solid phase welding method called friction stitch welding (FSW) is introduced, since the welding quality of which is almost insensitive to water. This article studies the influence of the bar shape on the welding quality. In the experiments, three typical kinds of shape combinations are adopted. Argon is used as protecting gas, and the flux of which is 30L/min. The feed speed of the spindle is 0.5 mm/s, the rotation speed is 4000r/min. Through the comparison of the macro features and microstructure of the welded joints, the influence of the bar shape on the welding quality is analyzed, and static stress distribution along with the influence on welding temperature by different shapes are investigated. The results indicate that the welding quality obtained by using straight bars with round head is much better than the other shape combinations, the welding defects are reduced and the welded material is much finer. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

80053067313	Selection and design of jumper connector	Jumper spools with connectors are widely used in subsea devices installations during offshore oil and gas fields exploration, and can be operated by horizontal tie-in system or vertical tie-in system. Mechanical collet connector, hydraulic collet connector, and clamp connector are the most common selection in subsea jumper spools connection. Mechanical collet connector is compactive, and leaves no hydraulic components subsea, but connector actuation tools is needed in operation. Hydraulic collet connector is operated directly from the ROV, and with no need for a dedicated actuating tool. Clamp connectors consist of a two piece segmented clamp design and are particularly well suited for larger bore, lower pressure horizontal connection applications. Different connector types and different tie-in manners demand different installation process and different tools. Diameter, tie-in manner, and tools should be considered carefully in the connector selection of jumper spool.

84863117035	Study on local dry welding of 304 stainless steel in nuclear power stations repair	Local dry welding is an important water welding method with special advantages for good flexibility in nuclear power stations repair where operation spaces are usually very limited, and it can be applied perfectly by simple integration of a lot of welding processes with shielding cup. An underwater welding system chamber was built, which is mainly comprised of an underwater welding test chamber, and a hydraulic driven underwater welding device. Shielding gas is inflated to the small compacted cup to drive water and protect arc and weld pool. At shallow water of 100mm, Pulsed MIG tests were carried out to investigate parameters which are related to welding process of 304 stainless steel cladding layers. Welding tests at different depth indicates that although profiles of welds produced both at pressures of 5 meters water depth and at pressures of 15 meters water depth are perfect, but cladding layer at 15 meters is more narrow and more high. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

84893104006	Reliability analysis of marine risers with narrow and long corrosion defects under combined loads	A marine riser, one of the most important components of offshore oil/gas transportation, needs to be designed to eliminate the risks caused by complex ocean environments, platform displacement and internal corrosion, etc. In this study, a new analytical-numerical assessment approach is proposed in order to quantitatively investigate the reliability of internally corroded risers under combined loads including axial tension and internal pressure. First, an analytical solution of the limit state function of intact risers under combined loads is obtained, which is further modified by the non-dimensional corrosion depth (d/t) for the risers with a narrow and long corrosion defect. The relationship between d/t and limited internal pressure is obtained by finite element analysis and nonlinear regression. Through an advanced first-order reliability method (HL-RF) algorithm, reliability analysis is performed to obtain the failure probability, the reliability index and the sensitivity. These results are further verified by Monte-Carlo importance sampling. The proposed approach of reliability analysis provides an accurate and effective way to estimate the reliability of marine risers with narrow and long corrosion defects under combined loads. © 2014 China University of Petroleum (Beijing) and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
