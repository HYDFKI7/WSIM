The observed dimuon invariant mass distribution is consistent with the Standard Model background-only hypothesis in the 120-150GeV search range. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125.5GeV, the observed (expected) upper limit at the 95% confidence level is 7.0 (7.2) times the Standard Model expectation. This corresponds to an upper limit on the branching ratio BR(H→μ<sup>+</sup>μ<sup>-</sup>)of 1.5 × 10<sup>-3</sup>.

84929403808	Measurements of fiducial and differential cross sections for Higgs boson production in the diphoton decay channel at √s = 8 TeV with ATLAS	Measurements of fiducial and differential cross sections are presented for Higgs boson production in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √s = 8TeV. The analysis is performed in the H → γγ decay channel using 20.3 fb<sup>−1</sup> of data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The signal is extracted using a fit to the diphoton invariant mass spectrum assuming that the width of the resonance is much smaller than the experimental resolution. The signal yields are corrected for the effects of detector inefficiency and resolution. The pp → H → γγ fiducial cross section is measured to be 43.2 ±9.4 (stat.) <sup>+3.2</sup><inf>−2.9</inf> (syst.) ±1.2 (lumi) fb for a Higgs boson of mass 125.4 GeV decaying to two isolated photons that have transverse momentum greater than 35% and 25% of the diphoton invariant mass and each with absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.37. Four additional fiducial cross sections and two cross-section limits are presented in phase space regions that test the theoretical modelling of different Higgs boson production mechanisms, or are sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model. Differential cross sections are also presented, as a function of variables related to the diphoton kinematics and the jet activity produced in the Higgs boson events. The observed spectra are statistically limited but broadly in line with the theoretical expectations.

84937644674	Implications of LHCb measurements and future prospects	During 2011 the LHCb experiment at CERN collected 1.0 fb<sup>-1</sup> of √s = 7 TeV pp collisions. Due to the large heavy quark production cross-sections, these data provide unprecedented samples of heavy flavoured hadrons. The first results from LHCb have made a significant impact on the flavour physics landscape and have definitively proved the concept of a dedicated experiment in the forward region at a hadron collider. This document discusses the implications of these first measurements on classes of extensions to the Standard Model, bearing in mind the interplay with the results of searches for on-shell production of new particles at ATLAS and CMS. The physics potential of an upgrade to the LHCb detector, which would allow an order of magnitude more data to be collected, is emphasised. © 2013 CERN for the benefit of the LHCb collaboration.

Clear suppression of prompt J/ψ production with respect to proton-proton collisions at large rapidity is observed, while the production of J/ψ from b-hadron decays is less suppressed. These results show good agreement with available theoretical predictions. The measurement shows that cold nuclear matter effects are important for interpretations of the related quark-gluon plasma signatures in heavy-ion collisions.

Results are presented from an analysis of proton-proton (pp) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3fb-1 in the dimuon channel. A narrow resonance with Standard Model Z couplings to fermions is excluded at 95% confidence level for masses less than 2.79 TeV in the dielectron channel, 2.53 TeV in the dimuon channel, and 2.90 TeV in the two channels combined. Limits on other model interpretations are also presented, including a grand-unification model based on the E6 gauge group, Z∗ bosons, minimal Z′ models, a spin-2 graviton excitation from Randall-Sundrum models, quantum black holes, and a minimal walking technicolor model with a composite Higgs boson.

The recently discovered Higgs boson is treated as a background. No significant evidence for an additional signal is observed. The results are presented as limits at the 95% confidence level on the production cross section of a scalar boson times branching ratio into two photons, in a fiducial volume where the reconstruction efficiency is approximately independent of the event topology. The upper limits set extend over a considerably wider mass range than previous searches.

The pp collision data used correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1fb-1, collected with the LHCb detector, at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. Combining our measured value of 1.010±0.010±0.008 for this ratio with the known B¯0 lifetime, we determine the flavor-specific B¯s0 lifetime to be τ(B¯s0)=1.535±0.015±0.014ps, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. This is the most precise measurement to date, and is consistent with previous measurements and theoretical predictions.

84925725354	Search for strong production of supersymmetric particles in final states with missing transverse momentum and at least three b-jets at √s = 8 TeV proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector	This paper reports the results of a search for strong production of supersymmetric particles in 20.1 fb <sup>-1</sup> of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The search is performed separately in events with either zero or at least one high-p<inf>T</inf> lepton (electron or muon), large missing transverse momentum, high jet multiplicity and at least three jets identified as originated from the fragmentation of a b-quark. No excess is observed with respect to the Standard Model predictions. The results are interpreted in the context of several supersymmetric models involving gluinos and scalar top and bottom quarks, as well as a mSUGRA/CMSSM model. Gluino masses up to 1340 GeV are excluded, depending on the model, significantly extending the previous ATLAS limits.

84925759768	Measurement of dijet cross-sections in pp collisions at 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy using the ATLAS detector	Double-differential dijet cross-sections measured in pp collisions at the LHC with a 7TeV centre-of-mass energy are presented as functions of dijet mass and half the rapidity separation of the two highest-pT jets. These measurements are obtained using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.5 fb<sup>−1</sup>, recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2011. The data are corrected for detector effects so that cross-sections are presented at the particle level. Cross-sections are measured up to 5TeV dijet mass using jets reconstructed with the anti-k<inf>t</inf> algorithm for values of the jet radius parameter of 0.4 and 0.6. The cross-sections are compared with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations by NLOJet++ corrected to account for non-perturbative effects. Comparisons with POWHEG predictions, using a next-to-leading-order matrix element calculation interfaced to a partonshower Monte Carlo simulation, are also shown. Electroweak effects are accounted for in both cases. The quantitative comparison of data and theoretical predictions obtained using various parameterizations of the parton distribution functions is performed using a frequentist method. In general, good agreement with data is observed for the NLOJet++ theoretical predictions when using the CT10, NNPDF2.1 and MSTW 2008 PDF sets. Disagreement is observed when using the ABM11 and HERAPDF1.5 PDF sets for some ranges of dijet mass and half the rapidity separation. An example setting a lower limit on the compositeness scale for a model of contact interactions is presented, showing that the unfolded results can be used to constrain contributions to dijet production beyond that predicted by the Standard Model.

84863116149	Absolute luminosity measurements with the LHCb detector at the LHC	Absolute luminosity measurements are of general interest for colliding-beam experiments at storage rings. These measurements are necessary to determine the absolute cross-sections of reaction processes and are valuable to quantify the performance of the accelerator. Using data taken in 2010, LHCb has applied two methods to determine the absolute scale of its luminosity measurements for proton-proton collisions at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. In addition to the classic ''van der Meer scan'' method a novel technique has been developed which makes use of direct imaging of the individual beams using beam-gas and beam-beam interactions. This beam imaging method is made possible by the high resolution of the LHCb vertex detector and the close proximity of the detector to the beams, and allows beam parameters such as positions, angles and widths to be determined. The results of the two methods have comparable precision and are in good agreement. Combining the two methods, an overal precision of 3.5% in the absolute luminosity determination is reached. The techniques used to transport the absolute luminosity calibration to the full 2010 data-taking period are presented. © 2012 CERN.

The search uses a set of variables carrying information on the event kinematics transverse and parallel to the beam line that are sensitive to several topologies expected in supersymmetry. Mutually exclusive final states are defined, allowing a combination of all channels to increase the search sensitivity. No deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed. Upper limits at 95 % confidence level on visible cross-sections for the production of new particles are extracted. Results are interpreted in the context of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension to the Standard Model and in supersymmetry-inspired models with diverse, high-multiplicity final states.

The measurement is based on the full 2010 data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb<sup>−1</sup> which was collected using the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Cluster splitting scales are measured in events containing W bosons decaying to electrons or muons. The measurement comprises the four hardest splitting scales in a k<inf>T</inf> cluster sequence of the hadronic activity accompanying the W boson, and ratios of these splitting scales. Backgrounds such as multi-jet and top-quark-pair production are subtracted and the results are corrected for detector effects. Predictions from various Monte Carlo event generators at particle level are compared to the data. Overall, reasonable agreement is found with all generators, but larger deviations between the predictions and the data are evident in the soft regions of the splitting scales.

The performance of various modified jet algorithms, or jet grooming techniques, for several jet types and event topologies is investigated for jets with transverse momentum larger than 300 GeV. Properties of jets subjected to the mass-drop filtering, trimming, and pruning algorithms are found to have a reduced sensitivity to multiple proton-proton interactions, are more stable at high luminosity and improve the physics potential of searches for heavy boosted objects. Studies of the expected discrimination power of jet mass and jet substructure observables in searches for new physics are also presented. Event samples enriched in boosted W and Z bosons and top-quark pairs are used to study both the individual jet invariant mass scales and the efficacy of algorithms to tag boosted hadronic objects.

84899093120	Observation of photon polarization in the b →sγ transition	This Letter presents a study of the flavor-changing neutral current radiative B±→K±π-π±γ decays performed using data collected in proton-proton collisions with the LHCb detector at 7 and 8 TeV center-of-mass energies. In this sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3fb-1, nearly 14000 signal events are reconstructed and selected, containing all possible intermediate resonances with a K±π- π± final state in the [1.1,1.9]GeV/c2 mass range. The distribution of the angle of the photon direction with respect to the plane defined by the final-state hadrons in their rest frame is studied in intervals of K±π-π± mass and the asymmetry between the number of signal events found on each side of the plane is obtained. The first direct observation of the photon polarization in the b→sγ transition is reported with a significance of 5.2σ. © 2014 CERN, for the LHCb Collaboration.

84899561004	Study of heavy-flavor quarks produced in association with top-quark pairs at s =7TeV using the ATLAS detector	Using a sample of dilepton top-quark pair (tt̄) candidate events, a study is performed of the production of top-quark pairs together with heavy-flavor (HF) quarks, the sum of tt̄+b+X and tt̄+c+X, collectively referred to as tt̄+HF. The data set used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.7fb-1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The presence of additional HF (b or c) quarks in the tt̄ sample is inferred by looking for events with at least three b-tagged jets, where two are attributed to the b quarks from the tt̄ decays and the third to additional HF production. The dominant background to tt̄+HF in this sample is tt̄+jet events in which a light-flavor jet is misidentified as a heavy-flavor jet. To determine the heavy- and light-flavor content of the additional b-tagged jets, a fit to the vertex mass distribution of b-tagged jets in the sample is performed. The result of the fit shows that 79±14(stat)±22(syst) of the 105 selected extra b-tagged jets originate from HF quarks, 3 standard deviations away from the hypothesis of zero tt̄+HF production. The result for extra HF production is quoted as a ratio (RHF) of the cross section for tt̄+HF production to the cross section for tt̄ production with at least one additional jet. Both cross sections are measured in a fiducial kinematic region within the ATLAS acceptance. RHF is measured to be [6.2±1.1(stat)±1.8(syst)]% for jets with pT>25GeV and |η|<2.5, in agreement with the expectations from Monte Carlo generators. © 2014 CERN, for the ATLAS Collaboration.

84900851668	Measurement of resonant and CP components in B ̄ s0 →j /ψπ+π- decays measurement of resonant and CP components ⋯ R. AAIJ et al.	Structure of the decay B̄s0→J/ψπ+π- is studied using data corresponding to 3fb-1 of integrated luminosity from pp collisions produced by the LHC and collected by the LHCb detector. Five interfering π+π- states are required to describe the decay: f0(980),f0(1500),f0(1790),f2(1270), and f2′(1525). An alternative model including these states and a nonresonant J/ψπ+π- component also provides a good description of the data. Based on the different transversity components measured for the spin-2 intermediate states, the final state is found to be compatible with being entirely CP odd. The CP-even part is found to be <2.3% at a 95% confidence level. The f0(500) state is not observed, allowing a limit to be set on the absolute value of the mixing angle with the f0(980) of <7.7° at a 90% confidence level, consistent with a tetraquark interpretation of the f0(980) substructure. © 2014 CERN, for the LHCb Collaboration.

84901405418	Search for invisible decays of a Higgs boson produced in association with a Z boson in ATLAS	A search for evidence of invisible-particle decay modes of a Higgs boson produced in association with a Z boson at the Large Hadron Collider is presented. No deviation from the standard model expectation is observed in 4.5 fb<sup>-1</sup> (20.3 fb<sup>-1</sup>) of 7 (8) TeV pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment. Assuming the standard model rate for ZH production, an upper limit of 75%, at the 95% confidence level is set on the branching ratio to invisible-particle decay modes of the Higgs boson at a mass of 125.5 GeV. The limit on the branching ratio is also interpreted in terms of an upper limit on the allowed dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section within a Higgs-portal dark matter scenario. Within the constraints of such a scenario, the results presented in this Letter provide the strongest available limits for low-mass dark matter candidates. Limits are also set on an additional neutral Higgs boson, in the mass range 110 <mH <400 GeV, produced in association with a Z boson and decaying to invisible particles.

The data cannot be described with K+Ï€- resonances alone, which is confirmed with a model-independent approach. A highly significant Z(4430)- Ïâ€ Ï€- component is required, thus confirming the existence of this state.

The analysis is based on 1400 Λb0 and Λ̄b0 baryons selected in 4.6fb-1 of proton-proton collision data with a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC.

The resonant structure of the reaction B̄0→J/ψπ+π- is studied using data from 3fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected by the LHCb experiment, one third at 7 TeV center-of-mass energy and the remainder at 8 TeV. The invariant mass of the π+π- pair and three decay angular distributions are used to determine the fractions of the resonant and nonresonant components. Six interfering π+π- states, ρ(770), f0(500), f2(1270), ρ(1450), ω(782) and ρ(1700), are required to give a good description of invariant mass spectra and decay angular distributions. The positive and negative charge parity fractions of each of the resonant final states are determined. The f0(980) meson is not seen and the upper limit on its presence, compared with the observed f0(500) rate, is inconsistent with a model where these scalar mesons are formed from two quarks and two antiquarks (tetraquarks) at the eight standard deviation level. In the qq̄ model, the absolute value of the mixing angle between the f0(980) and the f0(500) scalar mesons is limited to be less than 17° at 90% confidence level. © 2014 CERN, for the LHCb collaboration.

84907497537	Measurement of event-plane correlations in s NN =2.76 TeV lead-lead collisions with the ATLAS detector	A measurement of event-plane correlations involving two or three event planes of different order is presented as a function of centrality for 7 μb-1 Pb+Pb collision data at sNN=2.76 TeV, recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Fourteen correlators are measured using a standard event-plane method and a scalar-product method, and the latter method is found to give a systematically larger correlation signal. Several different trends in the centrality dependence of these correlators are observed. These trends are not reproduced by predictions based on the Glauber model, which includes only the correlations from the collision geometry in the initial state. Calculations that include the final-state collective dynamics are able to describe qualitatively, and in some cases also quantitatively, the centrality dependence of the measured correlators. These observations suggest that both the fluctuations in the initial geometry and the nonlinear mixing between different harmonics in the final state are important for creating these correlations in momentum space. © 2014 CERN, for the ATLAS Collaboration.

84907502729	Search for pair-produced third-generation squarks decaying via charm quarks or in compressed supersymmetric scenarios in pp collisions at √s =8TeV with the ATLAS detector	Results of a search for supersymmetry via direct production of third-generation squarks are reported, using 20.3fb-1 of proton-proton collision data at s=8TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2012. Two different analysis strategies based on monojetlike and c-tagged event selections are carried out to optimize the sensitivity for direct top squark-pair production in the decay channel to a charm quark and the lightest neutralino (t∼1→c+χ∼10) across the top squark-neutralino mass parameter space. No excess above the Standard Model background expectation is observed. The results are interpreted in the context of direct pair production of top squarks and presented in terms of exclusion limits in the (mt∼1, mχ∼10) parameter space. A top squark of mass up to about 240 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level for arbitrary neutralino masses, within the kinematic boundaries. Top squark masses up to 270 GeV are excluded for a neutralino mass of 200 GeV. In a scenario where the top squark and the lightest neutralino are nearly degenerate in mass, top squark masses up to 260 GeV are excluded. The results from the monojetlike analysis are also interpreted in terms of compressed scenarios for top squark-pair production in the decay channel t∼1→b+ff′+χ∼10 and sbottom pair production with b∼1→b+χ∼10, leading to a similar exclusion for nearly mass-degenerate third-generation squarks and the lightest neutralino. The results in this paper significantly extend previous results at colliders.

Neural networks are trained using Monte Carlo samples produced with a detailed detector simulation. This technique replaces the former clustering approach based on a connected component analysis and charge interpolation. The performance of the neural network splitting technique is quantified using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC collected by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and from Monte Carlo simulations. This technique reduces the number of clusters shared between tracks in highly energetic jets by up to a factor of three. It also provides more precise position and error estimates of the clusters in both the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter resolution.

Charged-particle mean (Formula presented.) and densities of all-particle (Formula presented.) and charged-particle multiplicity and (Formula presented.) have been measured in regions azimuthally transverse to the hardest jet in each event. These are presented both as one-dimensional distributions and with their mean values as functions of the leading-jet transverse momentum from 20 to 800 (Formula presented.). The correlation of charged-particle mean (Formula presented.) with charged-particle multiplicity is also studied, and the (Formula presented.) densities include the forward rapidity region; these features provide extra data constraints for Monte Carlo modelling of colour reconnection and beam-remnant effects respectively. For the first time, underlying event observables have been computed separately for inclusive jet and exclusive dijet event selections, allowing more detailed study of the interplay of multiple partonic scattering and QCD radiation contributions to the underlying event. Comparisons to the predictions of different Monte Carlo models show a need for further model tuning, but the standard approach is found to generally reproduce the features of the underlying event in both types of event selection.

Significant long-range "ridgelike" correlations are observed for pairs with small (|Δϕ|<π/3) and back-to-back pairs (|Δφ|>2π/3) over the transverse momentum range 0.4<p<inf>T</inf><12 GeV and in different intervals of event activity. The event activity is defined by either the number of reconstructed tracks or the total transverse energy on the Pb-fragmentation side. The azimuthal structure of such long-range correlations is Fourier decomposed to obtain the harmonics ν<inf>n</inf> as a function of pT and event activity. The extracted ν<inf>n</inf> values for n=2 to 5 decrease with n. The ν<inf>2</inf> and ν<inf>3</inf> values are found to be positive in the measured pT range. The ν<inf>1</inf> is also measured as a function of pT and is observed to change sign around pT≈1.5-2.0 GeV and then increase to about 0.1 for pT>4 GeV. The ν<inf>2</inf> (pT), ν<inf>3</inf> (pT), and ν<inf>4</inf> (pT) are compared to the ν<inf>n</inf> coefficients in Pb+Pb collisions at √sNN=2.76 TeV with similar event multiplicities. Reasonable agreement is observed after accounting for the difference in the average pT of particles produced in the two collision systems.

84910600831	Measurement of the cross-section of high transverse momentum vector bosons reconstructed as single jets and studies of jet substructure in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	This paper presents a measurement of the cross-section for high transverse momentum W and Z bosons produced in pp collisions and decaying to all-hadronic final states. The data used in the analysis were recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of and correspond to an integrated luminosity of . The measurement is performed by reconstructing the boosted W or Z bosons in single jets. The reconstructed jet mass is used to identify the W and Z bosons, and a jet substructure method based on energy cluster information in the jet centre-of-mass frame is used to suppress the large multi-jet background. The cross-section for events with a hadronically decaying W or Z boson, with transverse momentum and pseudorapidity , is measured to be pb and is compared to next-to-leading-order calculations. The selected events are further used to study jet grooming techniques.

84918499749	Precision luminosity measurements at LHCb	Measuring cross-sections at the LHC requires the luminosity to be determined accurately at each centre-of-mass energy s. In this paper results are reported from the luminosity calibrations carried out at the LHC interaction point 8 with the LHCb detector for s = 2.76, 7 and 8 TeV (proton-proton collisions) and for sNN = 5 TeV (proton-lead collisions). Both the "van der Meer scan" and "beam-gas imaging" luminosity calibration methods were employed. It is observed that the beam density profile cannot always be described by a function that is factorizable in the two transverse coordinates. The introduction of a two-dimensional description of the beams improves significantly the consistency of the results. For proton-proton interactions at s = 8 TeV a relative precision of the luminosity calibration of 1.47% is obtained using van der Meer scans and 1.43% using beam-gas imaging, resulting in a combined precision of 1.12%. Applying the calibration to the full data set determines the luminosity with a precision of 1.16%. This represents the most precise luminosity measurement achieved so far at a bunched-beam hadron collider.

84914140238	Search for long-lived neutral particles decaying into lepton jets in proton-proton collisions at √s= 8TeV with the ATLAS detector	Abstract: Several models of physics beyond the Standard Model predict neutral particles that decay into final states consisting of collimated jets of light leptons and hadrons (so-called “lepton jets”). These particles can also be long-lived with decay length comparable to, or even larger than, the LHC detectors’ linear dimensions. This paper presents the results of a search for lepton jets in proton-proton collisions at the centre-of-mass energy of √s= 8TeV in a sample of 20.3 fb<sup>−1</sup> collected during 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Limits on models predicting Higgs boson decays to neutral long-lived lepton jets are derived as a function of the particle’s proper decay length.

The charmless three-body decay modes B±→K±π+π-, B±→K±K+K-, B±→π±K+K- and B±→π±π+π- are reconstructed using data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0fb-1, collected by the LHCb detector. The inclusive CP asymmetries of these modes are measured to be ACP(B±→K±π+π-)=+0.025±0.004±0.004±0.007,ACP(B±→K±K+K-)=-0.036±0.004±0.002±0.007,ACP(B±→π±π+π-)=+0.058±0.008±0.009±0.007,ACP(B±→π±K+K-)=-0.123±0.017±0.012±0.007,where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic, and the third is due to the CP asymmetry of the B±→J/ψK± reference mode. The distributions of these asymmetries are also studied as functions of position in the Dalitz plot and suggest contributions from rescattering and resonance interference processes.

84914179451	Search for top squark pair production in final states with one isolated lepton, jets, and missing transverse momentum in (Formula presented.)= 8 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector	The results of a search for top squark (stop) pair production in final states with one isolated lepton, jets, and missing transverse momentum are reported. The analysis is performed with proton-proton collision data at (Formula presented.) = 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20 fb<sup>−1</sup>. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is taken to be the lightest neutralino which only interacts weakly and is assumed to be stable. The stop decay modes considered are those to a top quark and the LSP as well as to a bottom quark and the lightest chargino, where the chargino decays to the LSP by emitting a W boson. A wide range of scenarios with different mass splittings between the stop, the lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino are considered, including cases where the W bosons or the top quarks are off-shell. Decay modes involving the heavier charginos and neutralinos are addressed using a set of phenomenological models of supersymmetry. No significant excess over the Standard Model prediction is observed. A stop with a mass between 210 and 640 GeV decaying directly to a top quark and a massless LSP is excluded at 95% confidence level, and in models where the mass of the lightest chargino is twice that of the LSP, stops are excluded at 95% confidence level up to a mass of 500 GeV for an LSP mass in the range of 100 to 150 GeV. Stringent exclusion limits are also derived for all other stop decay modes considered, and model-independent upper limits are set on the visible cross-section for processes beyond the Standard Model.

Differential cross sections for the tq and t¯q processes are measured as a function of the transverse momentum and the absolute value of the rapidity of t and t¯, respectively. The analyzed data set was recorded with the ATLAS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.59fb-1. Selected events contain one charged lepton, large missing transverse momentum, and two or three jets. The cross sections are measured by performing a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the output distributions of neural networks. The resulting measurements are σ(tq)=46±1(stat)±6(syst)pb, σ(t¯q)=23±1(stat)±3(syst)pb, Rt=2.04±0.13(stat)±0.12(syst), and σ(tq+t¯q)=68±2(stat)±8(syst)pb, consistent with the Standard Model expectation. The uncertainty on the measured cross sections is dominated by systematic uncertainties, while the uncertainty on Rt is mainly statistical. Using the ratio of σ(tq+t¯q) to its theoretical prediction, and assuming that the top-quark-related CKM matrix elements obey the relation |Vtb|蠑|Vts|,|Vtd|, we determine |Vtb|=1.02±0.07.

84919401685	Search for nonpointing and delayed photons in the diphoton and missing transverse momentum final state in 8 TeV pp collisions at the LHC using the ATLAS detector search for nonpointing and delayed photons in ... G. Aad et al.	A search has been performed, using the full 20.3fb-1 data sample of 8 TeV proton-proton collisions collected in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, for photons originating from a displaced vertex due to the decay of a neutral long-lived particle into a photon and an invisible particle. The analysis investigates the diphoton plus missing transverse momentum final state, and is therefore most sensitive to pair production of long-lived particles. The analysis technique exploits the capabilities of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter to make precise measurements of the flight direction, as well as the time of flight, of photons. No excess is observed over the Standard Model predictions for background. Exclusion limits are set within the context of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models, with the lightest neutralino being the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle and decaying into a photon and gravitino with a lifetime in the range from 250 ps to about 100 ns.

Events are selected in final states with two charged leptons and at least two jets and in final states with one charged lepton and at least four jets. Four different observables sensitive to different properties of the top quark pair production mechanism are used to extract the correlation between the top and antitop quark spins.

The cross-section was measured to be: (Formula presented.)where the four uncertainties arise from data statistics, experimental and theoretical systematic effects, knowledge of the integrated luminosity and of the LHC beam energy. The results are consistent with recent theoretical QCD calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order. Fiducial measurements corresponding to the experimental acceptance of the leptons are also reported, together with the ratio of cross-sections measured at the two centre-of-mass energies. The inclusive cross-section results were used to determine the top quark pole mass via the dependence of the theoretically predicted cross-section on (Formula presented.) GeV. By looking for an excess of (Formula presented.) production with respect to the QCD prediction, the results were also used to place limits on the pair-production of supersymmetric top squarks (Formula presented.) with masses close to the top quark mass, decaying via (Formula presented.) to predominantly right-handed top quarks and a light neutralino (Formula presented.), the lightest supersymmetric particle. Top squarks with masses between the top quark mass and 177 GeV are excluded at the 95 % confidence level.

84919918864	Electron and photon energy calibration with the ATLAS detector using LHC Run 1 data	This paper presents the electron and photon energy calibration achieved with the ATLAS detector using about 25 fb-1 of LHC proton–proton collision data taken at centre-of-mass energies of (Equation Present) and 8 TeV. The reconstruction of electron and photon energies is optimised using multivariate algorithms. The response of the calorimeter layers is equalised in data and simulation, and the longitudinal profile of the electromagnetic showers is exploited to estimate the passive material in front of the calorimeter and reoptimise the detector simulation. After all corrections, the Z resonance is used to set the absolute energy scale. For electrons from Z decays, the achieved calibration is typically accurate to 0.05 % in most of the detector acceptance, rising to 0.2 % in regions with large amounts of passive material. The remaining inaccuracy is less than 0.2–1 % for electrons with a transverse energy of 10 GeV, and is on average 0.3 % for photons. The detector resolution is determined with a relative inaccuracy of less than 10 % for electrons and photons up to 60 GeV transverse energy, rising to 40 % for transverse energies above 500 GeV.

The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to 20.3fb-1 of proton-proton collisions delivered by the Large Hadron Collider at s=8TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector. Signal regions are designed to target supersymmetric scenarios that can be either enriched in or depleted of events involving the production of a Z boson.

Exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level on the masses of relevant supersymmetric particles are obtained. In R-parity-violating simplified models with decays of the lightest supersymmetric particle to electrons and muons, limits of 1350 and 750 GeV are placed on gluino and chargino masses, respectively. In R-parity-conserving simplified models with heavy neutralinos decaying to a massless lightest supersymmetric particle, heavy neutralino masses up to 620 GeV are excluded.

TeV with the ATLAS detector	Abstract: A search is presented for the production of new heavy quarks that decay to a Z boson and a third-generation Standard Model quark. In the case of a new charge +2/3 quark (T ), the decay targeted is T → Zt, while the decay targeted for a new charge −1/3 quark (B) is B → Zb. The search is performed with a dataset corresponding to 20.3 fb<sup>−1</sup> of pp collisions at (Formula presented.) TeV recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Selected events contain a high transverse momentum Z boson candidate reconstructed from a pair of oppositely charged same-flavor leptons (electrons or muons), and are analyzed in two channels defined by the absence or presence of a third lepton. Hadronic jets, in particular those with properties consistent with the decay of a b-hadron, are also required to be present in selected events. Different requirements are made on the jet activity in the event in order to enhance the sensitivity to either heavy quark pair production mediated by the strong interaction, or single production mediated by the electroweak interaction. No significant excess of events above the Standard Model expectation is observed, and lower limits are derived on the mass of vector-like T and B quarks under various branching ratio hypotheses, as well as upper limits on the magnitude of electroweak coupling parameters.
