8844265259	Regeneration of acid orange 7-exhausted granular activated carbons with microwave irradiation	An investigation was performed for the regeneration of three granular activated carbons (GACs) exhausted with acid orange 7 (AO7). The three GACs were made from different materials, i.e. coconut shells, almond nucleus and coal. The AO7 adsorption process was carried out in a continuous-flow adsorption column. After adsorption, the AO7-saturated GAC was dried at 120°C, then regenerated in a quartz reactor by 2450 MHz microwave (MW) irradiation at 850 W for 5 min. The efficacy of this procedure was analyzed by determining the rates and amounts of AO7 adsorbed in successive adsorption-MW regeneration cycles. Effects of this regeneration on the structural properties, surface chemistry and the AO7 adsorption capacities of GAC samples were examined. It was found that after several adsorption-MW regeneration cycles, the adsorption rates and capacities of GACs could maintain relatively high levels, even higher than those of virgin GACs, as indicated by AO7 breakthrough curves and adsorption isotherms. The improvement of GAC adsorption properties resulted from the modification of pore size distribution and surface chemistry by MW irradiation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The FTIR data gained gave the consist evidences by two different sampling preparation methods that the interaction mechanism between humic substances and hematite was mainly conform to the ligand-exchange involving carboxylic functional groups of humic substances and the surfaces sites of hematite. The present method, although associated with some uncertainties, provided an opportunity to increase the knowledge in this field. © 2005 Science Press. All rights reserved.

2342488004	Temperature measurement of GAC and decomposition of PCP loaded on GAC and GAC-supported copper catalyst in microwave irradiation	A sheltered type-K thermocouple was applied to record the temperature rising courses of granular activated carbon (GAC) in a microwave irradiation field under various conditions. The results showed that GAC could absorb microwave energy effectively and its temperature rose up to 1100°C in a few minutes. This interaction of GAC and microwave was utilized to the preparation of GAC-supported copper catalyst. The catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), iodine number and adsorption isotherm. It was found that elemental copper distributed uniformly on the surface of GAC, and after loading copper, the adsorption capacity of GAC decreased due to occupation of adsorption sites by copper. Decomposition of a typical chlorinated organic chemical, pentachlorophenol (PCP), on virgin GAC and copper-loaded GAC was assisted by microwave irradiation. Firstly, PCP in water was adsorbed onto GAC, then PCP-loaded GAC irradiated by microwave in a quartz reactor. The results indicated that most of PCP adsorbed on virgin GAC was decomposed or bound irreversibly to GAC under 850w microwave irradiation for 10min, and less than 2% was transformed into intermediates. A more rapid decomposition rate of PCP was observed on copper-loaded GAC with larger amount of intermediates formed. Identification of intermediates was accomplished by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

23944434741	Degradation of H-acid in aqueous solution by microwave assisted wet air oxidation using Ni-loaded GAC as catalyst	A novel process, microwave assisted catalytic wet air oxidation (MW-CWO), was applied for the degradation of H-acid (1-amino-8-naphthol-3, 6-disulfonic acid) in aqueous solution. Ni-loaded granular activated carbon (GAG), prepared by immersion-calcination method, was used as catalyst. The results showed that the MW-CWO process was very effective for the degradation of H-acid in aqueous solution under atmospheric pressure with 87.4% TOC (total organic carbon) reduction in 20 min. Ni on GAC existed in the form of NiO as specified by XRD. Loss of Ni was significant in the initial stage, and then remained almost constant after 20 min reaction. BET surface area results showed that the surface property of GAC after MW-CWO process was superior to that of blank GAC. © 2005 Science Press. All rights reserved.

33746306226	Electrochemically enhanced adsorption of aniline on activated carbon fibers	For adsorptive separation processes, the adsorption rate and capacity are two important factors affecting the costs. This study describes the anodic polarization of activated carbon fibers (ACFs), which can enhance the adsorption rate and capacity of aniline. The electrosorption kinetics and the affecting factors (bias potential, electrolyte, and pH) of isotherms for aniline on ACFs were investigated. The adsorption/electrosorption of aniline on ACFs follow pseudo-first-order adsorption kinetics, and the adsorption rate improves with increasing bias potential. The electrosorption isotherms, which exhibit a variety of responses depending on bias potential, electrolyte and pH, follow the two classical models of Langmuir and Freundlich. With electrosorption of aniline from aqueous solution, a two-fold enhancement of adsorption capacity is achievable. The initial and saturated ACFs were characterized using scanning electron micrograph (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The SEM micrographs show that the surface of ACFs is not oxidized, which is also verified by cyclic voltammetry results. The FT-IR spectroscopy suggests that the interaction between aniline and ACFs is main weak physisorption instead of chemisorption. These experimental results suggest that the electrochemical polarization of ACFs can effectively improve the adsorption rate and capacity of aniline, which may be due to the enhanced affinity between aniline and ACFs instead of the oxidation on the surface of ACFs or in the solution. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

33747792681	Degradation of p-nitrophenol in aqueous solution by microwave assisted oxidation process through a granular activated carbon fixed bed	A microwave (MW) assisted oxidation process was investigated for degradation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) from aqueous solution. The process consisted of a granular activated carbon (GAC) fixed bed reactor, a MW source, solution and air supply system, and a heat exchanger. The process was operated in continuous flow mode. Air was applied for oxygen supply. GAC acted as a MW energy absorption material as well as the catalyst for PNP degradation. MW power, air flow, GAC dose, and influent flow proved to be major factors which influenced PNP degradation. The results showed that PNP was degraded effectively by this new process. Under a given condition (PNP concentration 1330 mg/L, MW power 500 W, influent flow 6.4 mL/min, air flow 100 mL/min), PNP removed 90%, corresponding to 80% of TOC removal. The pathway of PNP degradation was deduced based on GC-MS identification of course products. PNP experienced sequential oxidation steps and mineralized ultimately. Nitro-group of PNP converted to nitrite and nitrate. Biodegradability of the solution was improved apparently after treatment by MW assisted oxidation process, which benefit to further treatment of the solution using biochemical method. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33747807644	Microwave assisted catalytic wet air oxidation of H-acid in aqueous solution under the atmospheric pressure using activated carbon as catalyst	Catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) is a promising method for the treatment of heavily contaminated wastewater. However, its application is restricted due to severe operation conditions (high pressure and high temperature). A microwave (MW) assisted oxidation method was investigated aiming to treat heavily contaminated wastewater under milder conditions. H-acid (1-amino-8-naphthol-3, 6-disulfonic acid) was selected as target compound to evaluate the performance of this novel process. The removal of H-acid and TOC (total organic carbon) for H-acid solution of 3000 mg/L reached as high as 92.6% in 20 min and 84.2% in 60 min, respectively under optimal conditions. The existence of activated carbon and oxygen proved to be critical for effective treatment. The activated carbon acted not only as a catalyst for H-acid decomposition, but also as a special material for the absorption of MW energy. Air was supplied to the reactor as an oxygen source at constant flows. The amino group in H-acid was converted ultimately into nitrate, and sulfonic group into sulfate. This observation gave an evidence of H-acid mineralization although other organic intermediates were unable to be determined. The value of BOD

The kinetics, which followed the Lagergren adsorption rate law, exhibited a variety of responses depending on bias potential, initial concentration, and electrolyte. The electrosorption isotherms were in agreement with the classical models of Langmuir and Freundlich, but the former gave more satisfactory correlation coefficients.

33748961315	The removal of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate surfactant from water using silica/titania nanorods/nanotubes composite membrane with photocatalytic capability	This paper reports experimental results on removal of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS), using silica/titania nanorods/nanotubes composite membrane with photocatalytic capability. This multifunctional composite membrane has been successfully prepared from colloidal X-silica/titania sols (X denotes molar percent of silica) by the sol-gel technique. The prepared nanorods/nanotubes composite membranes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), scanning probe microscope (SPM) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). XRD patterns confirmed that the embedding of amorphous silica into nanophase titania matrix helped to increase the thermal stability of titania and control the size of titania particles. The small size titania particles with anatase phase played an important role in formation of silica/titania nanorods/nanotubes composite membranes with photocatalytic capability. The percentage of anatase phase titania reached 93% when 20%-silica/titania nanorods/nanotubes composite membrane calcined at 400 °C for 2 h. Most (95%) of the pore volume was located in mesopores of diameters ranging from 1.4 to 10 nm. The experimental results showed that the removal of SDBS achieved 89% after 100 min by combining the photocatalysis with membrane filtration techniques. Although the SDBS was not completely decomposed by photocatalysis, the degradation of the SDBS helped to enhance composite membrane flux and prevent membrane fouling. It was possible to treat successfully surfactant wastewater using multifunctional silica/titania nanorods/nanotubes composite membrane by means of a continuous process; this could be interesting for industrial applications. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

33749387901	Fabrication and characterization of silica/titania nanotubes composite membrane with photocatalytic capability	Silica/titania nanotubes composite membranes were successfully prepared from silica/titania sols using porous alumina support membranes. XRD patterns of the composite membranes confirmed that the embedding of amorphous silica into nanophase titania matrix helped to increase the thermal stability of titania which suppressed the phase transformation from anatase to rutile and decreased the size of titania particles. Ninety-five percent of the pore volume of composite membrane was located in mesopores with diameters ranging from 1.4 to 10 nm. The surface of these composite membranes exhibited extremely high affinity for water under UV irradiation with water contact angle decreased from 62° to nearly 5° within 80 min. By coupling membrane separation with photocatalysis technique, the removal efficiency of Direct Black 168 was improved remarkably; being 85% within 100 min, while the values were 66% and 73% with photocatalysis alone or membrane separation alone during the same time, respectively. Good photocatalytic activity and wettability of composite membrane under UV irradiation helped to obtain high permeate flux across the composite membrane. The silica/titania nanotubes composite membrane had the multifunctions of separation, degradation, and improvement of membrane flux in photooxidation of organic contaminants in wastewater. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

The microstructure, phase structure and adhesion of washcoat were investigated by SEM, XRD, ultrasonic vibration and thermal shock. The results showed that the loading and adhesion of washcoat were affected obviously by the properties of suspension, such as the zeta potential and the amount of adding binders. A small quantity of aluminum isopropoxide could promote the cohesive affinity of washcoat in thermal shock. The adhesion of washcoat in ultrasonic vibration could be reinforced by increasing calcined temperature and adding a certain aluminum particles.

The silicon nanowires were grown on carbon cloth via the vapor-liquid-solid reaction using silane gas as the silicon source and gold as catalyst from the decomposition of hydrogen gold tetrachloride. An emission current density of 1 mA cm2 was obtained at an operating electric field of 0.7 Vμm. Such low field is resulted from a high field enhancement factor of 6.1× 104 due to the combined effects of the high intrinsic aspect ratio of silicon nanowires and the woven geometry of carbon cloth. Such results may lead silicon nanowire field emitters to practical applications in vacuum microelectronic devices including microwave devices. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

The addition of 0.5-2 wt% TiO2 enhanced PNP photodegradation with approximately 1.36 times increase in apparent rate of PNP disappearance. Soil moisture, humic acid and soil pH were important factors influencing the rate of PNP photodegradation. Increase in soil moisture improved the degradation significantly, whereas humic acid reduced the degradation rate. Changes in soil pH resulted in different degradation rates, and higher degradation efficiencies were observed under alkaline condition. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

34748920705	Fabrication of needle-like ZnO nanorods arrays by a low-temperature seed-layer growth approach in solution	Uniform, large-scale, and well-aligned needle-like ZnO nanorods with good photoluminescence and photocatalysis properties on Zn substrates, have been successfully fabricated using a simple low-temperature seed-layer growth approach in solution (50 °C). The formation of ZnO seed-layer by the anodic oxidation technique (AOT) plays an important role in the subsequent growth of highly oriented ZnO nanorods arrays. Temperature also proved to be a significant factor in the growth of ZnO nanorods and had a great effect on their optical properties. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) indicated that the needle-like ZnO nanorods were single crystal in nature and that they had grown up preferentially along the [0001] direction. The well-aligned ZnO nanorods arrays on Zn substrates exhibited strong UV emission at around 380 nm at room temperature. To investigate their potential as photocatalysts, degradation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in aqueous solution was carried out using photocatalytic processes, with comparison to direct photolysis. After 1 h, the degradation efficiencies of PCP by direct photolysis and photocatalytic processes achieved 57% and 76% under given experimental conditions, respectively. This improved degradation efficiency of PCP illustrates that ZnO nanorods arrays on Zn substrates have good photocatalytic activity. This simple low-temperature seed-layer growth approach in solution resulted in the development of an effective and low-cost fabrication process for high-quality ZnO nanorods arrays with good optical and photocatalytic properties that can be applicable in many fields such as photocatalysis, photovoltaic cells, luminescent sensors, and photoconductive sensors. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

0034103431	The use of PLS algorithms and quantum chemical parameters derived from PM3 hamiltonian in QSPR studies on direct photolysis quantum yields of substituted aromatic halides	The Partial Least-Squares (PLS) method was used to further study Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) for photohydrolysis quantum yields of selected aromatic halides. The cluster of substituted bromobenzenes and iodobenzenes was further grouped into two clusters, substituted bromobenzenes and substituted iodobenzenes, for which QSPRs were obtained, respectively. The QSPRs obtained by PLS are more significant than those obtained in previous studies. The studies showed that only when the compounds belonging to different groups are studies separately, inherent relationships between molecular properties and their structure characteristics can be revealed. It can be generally concluded that the photohydrolysis quantum yields of the substituted aromatic halides are dependent on the overall characters of the molecules, the characters of the carbon-halogen bonds to be broken in the photolysis, and the character of the halogen atoms to be replaced in the photolysis. Electronegativity has great relevance to the photohydrolysis processes of the compounds. Substituted aromatic halides with large average molecular polarizability and molecular weight values tend to have low photolysis quantum yields. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

39249084403	Investigation of pentachlorophenol vertical transportation in soil column during its phototransformation on the soil surface	Pentachlorophenol (PCP) vertical transportation in soil column during its phototransformation on the soil surface was investigated using a new designed photoreactor. Three kinds of soils were used to study the effect of soil water and soil properties. In air-dried sandy loam, no obvious PCP transportation occurred in the soil profile when PCP was phototransformed on the soil surface. And the average removal of PCP in the whole soil column was close to zero after 48 h irradiation. In the moist sandy loam, PCP in the deeper soil could transport to the soil surface with water evaporation and then be transformed during UV irradiation, thus the average PCP removal in the whole soil column was improved. When the initial water contents are 9.3 and 19.2%, the average PCP removal in the sandy loam after 48 h irradiation accounted to 20.9 and 39.9%, respectively. The improving of PCP removal induced by soil water was limited in the clay and silt soils where PCP transportation was impeded because of their higher adsorption capacity. In the silt soil where the initial water content was 19.7%, not only PCP transportation in the deeper soil but also PCP phototransformation on the surface was inhibited seriously because of the high organic matter content of 18%. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

UV-vis absorption and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis show that the fractions C and Dpossessedmore aromatic C=C content. The influences of HAs and their fractions on the photolysis were investigated by the photodegradation of 2,4-D solutions under simulated solar light irradiation. The degradation rate of 2,4-D was found to decrease in the presence of bulk HAs or their fractions especially at high HAs concentration. The fractions of strong polarity C and D retarded the degradation rate more than the fractions of weak polarity A and B. This could be attributed to the different absorption intensity of the four HAs fractions in the order of D ≥ C > A > B, and the stronger π-π electron donor-acceptor interactions between the strong polar fractions and 2,4-D. © 2008 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag.

Sorption isotherms of DPH were determined for the two original soils and soils combusted at 375°C (only BC). The sorption isotherms of the original soils were linear, whereas the isotherms of the combusted soils were highly nonlinear (nF = 0.45, 0.60). It is indicated that intrinsic BC-water sorption coefficient is not possible to be used to estimate total sorption to the original soil, even in our relatively high concentrations. From the sorption isotherms, Freundlich coefficient of environmental BC sorption, KF,BCenv of 102.55 ± 0.21 was calculated and could be used as a generic starting point for environmental modeling purposes. From the data, it could be deduced that BC was responsible for 50% of the total sorption at concentrations of 45 and 4 μg/L (μg/L range), which were significantly higher than literature concentrations (ng/L range). These results demonstrate that in soil with high BC:TOC ratio BC is the most important geosorbent constituent with respect to sorption of DPH at relatively high concentrations ranged in μg/L.

64549083581	Flow injection analysis of chemical oxygen demand (COD) by using a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode	A simple, environmentally friendly and continuous flow method was developed for the determination of COD based on a flow injection analysis (FIA) system, in which a BDD electrode was employed as the detecting element. The structure and the electrochemical behavior of BDD were investigated by a scanning electron microscope, Raman spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry, respectively. The results demonstrated that the high-quality BDD film prepared here was suitable to be used as an electrode, with which the COD measurement could be conducted. The effect of several important experimental parameters, such as applied potentials, pH, flow rates, and supporting electrolyte concentrations, on the analytical performance was investigated. Under optimized testing conditions, the proposed method was successfully applied in the COD analysis of synthetic samples. The linear range and the detection limit were 2-175 and 1 mg L

67349152775	Photochemical activity and characterization of the complex of humic acids with iron(III)	This study examined the effects of humic acids (HA) and Fe(III)-HA complex on the photodegradation of atrazine, one of the most widely used herbicides. It was shown that the photolysis of atrazine proceeded via first-order reaction kinetics and that atrazine photodegradation was inhibited by the presence of HA, whereas the rate for atrazine photolysis was promoted in solutions containing both HA and Fe(III). Interactions of Fe(III) with HA were characterized by SEM, EDX, UV-Vis and FTIR, revealing that Fe(III)-HA complex was formed by ligand exchange between oxygen groups of HA and Fe(III).

67651122920	Evaluating the fate of three HCHs in the typically agricultural environment of Liaoning Province, China	The LRBPOP model has been developed to calculate the long-term fate of α-, β-, and γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) in the lower reach of Liaohe River basin, a typically agricultural environment in Liaoning Province, China. For this purpose, seasonally existent crop compartment, time-variant emission rates, and seasonal model parameters are provided in the model calculation. Besides, crop processing factor (PF) is also introduced to calculate the concentration in foodstuff produced by crop. The fate of three HCHs from 1952 to 2011 is calculated. Sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, and model comparison are conducted to evaluate the model. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the LRBPOP model is most sensitive to air and water advection, HCHs applied rate, and reaction half-life in soil. Model comparison shows that absolute levels, partitioning between media, temporal trends, and ratios between HCHs reproduce well within an order of magnitude, often within a factor of 3. The predicted results indicate that the study area has been subject to severe contamination of HCHs in the early of 1980s, and the residues of three HCHs decrease largely with different vanishing rates after 1983. According to modeling results, the 97.5th percentiles of ΣHCH residues in surface water, agricultural soil, and crop food are lower than the corresponding maximum residue limits (MRLs) in 2008, 2005, and 2005, respectively. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

By the use of the partial least squares method and 11 fundamental quantum chemical descriptors computed from the PM3 Hamiltonian, a Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship model was obtained for direct photolysis half-lives of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) under irradiation of sunlight. Direct photolysis half-lives for some other PAHs without reported values were predicted. It was concluded from the model that the main factors affecting photolysis half-lives of PAHs under irradiation of sunlight are PAH absolute hardness and electronegativity, which are related to the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and the highest occupied molecular orbital, (E

Pd particles were well dispersed on CNTs wall surfaces with average sizes no more than 20 nm, in most cases around 10 nm. Experiments for dechlorination of 2,4,5-trichlorobiphenyl (PCB 29) in methanol/water solution were carried out for the first time using Pd/CNTs/Ti cathode for investigation of its performance in electrocatalytic dechlorination of PCBs. Results show that Pd/CNTs/Ti presented better dechlorination efficiency (up to 90% in 6 h) than Pd/Ti and Pd/graphite cathodes owing to unique properties owned by CNTs, which benefited enhanced dechlorination of PCB 29. Complete dechlorination for PCB 29 was observed and biphenyl was identified to be final dechlorination product. The amount of Pd loading, cathode potential, and electrolytes were found to be key factors influencing dechlorination performance. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

The substances with porphyrin-like core structure, such as chlorophyll or heme, were employed as template substances for preparing molecular imprinting polymers (MIP). The polymers were used to separate the substances with porphyrin-like structure from HA. Photochemical experiments were conducted to evaluate effects of the separated HA fractions on the photodegradation of coexisting organic pollutant. The results showed that all fractions bound by MIP accelerated photochemical degradation of coexisting 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) under simulated sunlight (> 290 nm) irradiation, indicating that HA with porphyrin-like structure possesses better photoactivity than ones without the structure. The photochemical degradation of 2,4-D was enhanced when Fe(III), the ubiquitous element in natural aquatic systems, was added owing to the formation of Fe(III) complex with the HA.

The effects of an electric field and ZVI on granulation were investigated in three UASB reactors operated in parallel: an electric field enhanced ZVI-UASB reactor (reactor R1), a ZVI-UASB reactor (reactor R2) and a common UASB reactor (reactor R3). When a voltage of 1.4 V was supplied to reactor R1, COD removal dramatically increased from 60.3% to 90.7% over the following four days, while the mean granule size rapidly grew from 151.4 μm to 695.1 μm over the following 38 days. Comparatively, COD removal was lower and the increase in granule size was slower in the other two reactors (in the order: R1 > R2 > R3). The electric field caused the ZVI to more effectively buffer acidity and maintain a relatively low oxidation-reduction potential in the reactor. In addition, the electric field resulted in a significant increase in ferrous ion leaching and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production. These changes benefited methanogenesis and granulation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that different microorganisms were dominant in the external and internal layers of the reactor R1 granules. Additionally, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis indicated that the relative abundance of methanogens in reactor R1 was significantly greater than in the other two reactors. Taken together, these results suggested that the use of ZVI combined with an electric field in an UASB reactor could effectively enhance the sludge granulation. © 2010.

78650611729	Photochlorination of bisphenol A by UV-Vis light irradiation in saline solution: Effects of iron, nitrate and citric acid	Environmental context Chlorinated organic compounds are ubiquitous in the environment, and cause concern owing to their persistence and toxicity to organisms. In addition to anthropogenic sources, photochemical processes in saline waters could also yield chlorinated organic compounds. The present paper investigates the effects of iron, pH, nitrate and dissolved organic matter on the photochlorination of bisphenol A, a widely distributed endocrine disrupting chemical. Abstract Effects of several key influencing factors of environmental photochemistry, including iron, nitrate and dissolved organic matter (DOM), on the photochlorination of bisphenol A (BPA) were investigated. Iron promoted the formation of chlorinated BPA, but the rate decreased with increasing pH.

The experiments were carried out in three reactors operated in parallel: an electric field enhanced ZVI-anaerobic reactor (R1), a ZVI-anaerobic reactor (R2) and a common anaerobic reactor (R3). R1 presented the highest performance in removal of COD and color. Raising voltage in R1 further improved its performance. Scanning electron microscopy images displayed that the structure of granular sludge from R1 was intact after being fed with the high dye concentration, while that of R3 was broken. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis indicated that the abundance of methanogens in R1 was significantly greater than that in the other two reactors. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that the coupling of electric field and ZVI increased the diversity of microbial community and especially enhanced bacterial strains responsible for decolorization. © 2010.

In this study, the adsorption behaviors of five structurally related ionizable organic contaminants namely perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 4-n-nonylphenol (4-NP) onto MWNTs with different oxygen contents (3.84-22.85%) were investigated. The adsorption kinetics was investigated and simulated with pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption isotherms were found to be fitted with Freundlich model and influenced by both the properties of organic chemicals and the oxygen contents of MWNTs. As adsorption capacity decreases dramatically with the increasing of oxygen contents, the MWNTs with the lowest oxygen contents possess the highest adsorption capacity among four MWNTs. For the MWNTs with the oxygen contents of 3.84%, the adsorption affinity related with hydrophobic interaction and π-electron polarizability decreased in the order of 4-NP>PFOSA>PFOS>2,4-D>PFOA. Furthermore, the adsorption characters of five contaminants were affected by solution pH and solute pK

79956371075	A graphene-based platform for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping	A facile, rapid, stable and sensitive approach for fluorescent detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is designed based on DNA ligase reaction and π-stacking between the graphene and the nucleotide bases. In the presence of perfectly matched DNA, DNA ligase can catalyze the linkage of fluorescein amidite-labeled single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a phosphorylated ssDNA, and thus the formation of a stable duplex in high yield. However, the catalytic reaction cannot effectively carry out with one-base mismatched DNA target. In this case, we add graphene to the system in order to produce different quenching signals due to its different adsorption affinity for ssDNA and double-stranded DNA. Taking advantage of the unique surface property of graphene and the high discriminability of DNA ligase, the proposed protocol exhibits good performance in SNP genotyping. The results indicate that it is possible to accurately determine SNP with frequency as low as 2.6% within 40. min. Furthermore, the presented flexible strategy facilitates the development of other biosensing applications in the future. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79958766000	Formation of 2′-hydroxy-2,3′,4,5′-tetrabromodipheyl ether (2′-HO-BDE68) from 2,4-dibromophenol in aqueous solution under simulated sunlight irradiation	Hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (HO-PBDEs) have received significant attention due to their toxicities and universal presence in the environmental matrices. However, their origins are not fully understood. We explored the feasibility of the generation of HO-PBDEs through photochemical processes from bromophenol, a commonly detected pollutant with anthropogenic source in freshwater and natural source in the marine environment. The results showed that when 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-diBP) was irradiated in aquatic solutions under simulated sunlight, significant amounts of 2′-hydroxy-2,3′,4,5′-tetrabromodipheyl ether (2′-HO-BDE68) were rapidly formed as the dimeric product of 2,4-diBP. The formation of 2′-HO-BDE68 intensified with the increase of light intensity and with the initial concentration increase of 2,4-diBP, whereas it weakened with an increase in pH. Moreover, Fe(III) and fulvic acid played important roles in the formation of 2′-HO-BDE68. This study provides important insight into a possible source of HO-PBDEs from bromophenols in natural aquatic systems through photochemical approaches. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79959877571	Graphene sheets grafted Ag@AgCl hybrid with enhanced plasmonic photocatalytic activity under visible light	Interfacing photocatalyst with graphene sheet gives rise to an extraordinary modification to the properties of the resulting hybrids. Graphene sheet grafted Ag@AgCl composite is fabricated by photoreducing AgCl/graphene oxide (GO) hybrids prepared by deposition-precipitation method. The microscopic analysis and Raman scattering reveal the direct interface between Ag nanocrystal and graphene sheet, which manipulates the electronic structures of Ag@AgCl. UV-vis absorption spectra of Ag@AgCl/reduced GO (RGO) hybrids exhibit strong absorbance in the visible region due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption of Ag nanocrystal. In situ assembled Ag@AgCl/RGO plasmonic photocatalyst exhibits remarkable photocatalytic activity. Compared with bare Ag@AgCl nanoparticle, a 4-fold enhancement in the photodegradation rate toward rhodamine B is observed over Ag@AgCl/RGO hybrids under visible light irradiation. The large enhancement of photocatalytic activity was attributed to the effective charge transfer from plasmon-excited Ag nanocrystal to RGO, which suppress the charge recombination during photocatalytic process. This work could provide new insights into the fabrication of high performance plasmonic photocatalyst and facilitate their practical application in environmental issues. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

80052069962	In situ controllable growth of noble metal nanodot on graphene sheet	A facile and green method was developed for controllable growth of metal nanodot on graphene sheet. Ultrafine metal nanodots with a size of ∼2.0 nm in a narrow size distribution are uniformly decorated on graphene sheet through a sonolytic followed by hydrothermal reduction route without extra reducing agent. While hydrothermal reduction without sonolytic treatment, metal nanocrystal with a diameter of ∼18 nm grows on graphene sheet. The size-selective growth of metal nanodots on graphene sheet arises from the higher diffusion barrier in metal ion doped graphene oxide (GO) system formed during sonolytic process and limited the size of growing metal nanodot. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra suggest there is a size-dependent alternation of electronic structure of metal nanodot on graphene sheet, giving rise to unusual electronic and catalytic properties. The synthetic strategies described here were expanded on the range of metal nanodot/graphene composites, paving new avenues for the nanodot buildup and therefore promoting functionality. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Furthermore, the self-assembled bio-composites exhibit high stability even in saline solution (0.4 M NaCl) and can function as ideal components for real-time assay for screening genotoxic chemicals, not only avoiding the complex layer-by-layer assembly in comparison with those of conventional electrochemistry-based sensors, but also improving the signal transduction. We envision that the stacked-CCG, a novel type of colloidal graphene-derived material, could open new opportunities for the rational design of multifunctional graphene-based biocomposites and provide a brand new avenue in biosensing, drug screening and genotoxicity screening in the future. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Considering that zero-valent iron (ZVI) is expected to abbreviate the above negative effects due to its reductibility, a ZVI bed was packed into an anaerobic (ZVI-anaerobic) reactor (R1) for improvement of sulfate-containing wastewater treatment. The results showed that R1 could maintain high COD removal performance (87.4%) at sulfate concentration (1100. mg/L), significantly higher than a control reactor without ZVI (R2, 58.2%). In R1, 95% of the sulfate was reduced at the bottom, which decreased its effects on methanogens in the upper portion. In consequence, the COD removal in the upper portion of R1 (39.4%) was significantly higher than that of R2 (11.4%). Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the fractions of methanogens and SRB presented highest in the upper portion and the bottom of R1 respectively. PCR-DGGE analysis indicated that the microbial communities between the bottom and the upper part of R1 were different and diversity by the addition of ZVI bed. The functionalized partitioning of microbial activities in R1, i.e., most sulfate reduction occurring in the bottom and more efficient methanogenesis occurring in the upper, which was similar to a two-stage anaerobic reactor for sulfate-containing wastewater treatment, made this ZVI-anaerobic reactor displayed well. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of the synthesis method on the catalytic activity was investigated. XRD patterns revealed that both OMS-2 materials had the typical cryptomelane-type structure. OMS-2 by the refluxing method exhibited the higher catalytic activity than that by the solid-state reaction method, on which the complete oxidation of toluene was achieved at 240°C. According to the results of temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), it was apparent that more available lattice oxygen and higher oxygen mobility were attributed to the catalytic activity of OMS-2 from the refluxing method.

What is more, one of the unique features of our synergetic catalyst is that its interface can be reversibly switched from "inactive" to "active" upon treatment with different ssDNA species in solution, thus providing a powerful and versatile basis for designing graphene/DNA-based label-free colorimetric biosensors. Compared with other signal transduction modes in traditional graphene/aptamer-based systems, our novel signaling strategy not only avoids any labeling or modification procedures but also reduces the background signal due to the "off-on" switching mode during the sensing. Furthermore, this facile and general approach can be applicable to the other extended graphene/aptamer-based systems for colorimetric detection of a wide range of analytes. We envision that the tunable graphene-based smart interface could find potential applications in the development of biocatalysis, bioassays, and smart material devices in the future. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

To prevent grain agglomeration during ball milling and growth during hot pressing, organic agent (Oleic Acid, OA) as additive was added into the materials at the beginning of the ball milling process. With different concentrations of OA (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5. wt%), grains with different sizes are obtained. Structural analysis clearly shows that it is the particle size of the nanopowders that determines the final grain size in the densely compacted bulk samples. A combination of small grains ~200-500. nm and nanopores leads to effective phonon scattering, which results in the decrease of lattice thermal conductivity, and ZT of ~1.3 at 373.

Nano-curcumin with improved stability and similar antioxidant efficiency compared with that of unmodified curcumin was developed by using methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone) copolymer (MPEG-PCL) as carrier followed by incorporating into the N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan/oxidized alginate hydrogel (CCS-OA hydrogel). In vitro release study revealed that the encapsulated nano-curcumin was slowly released from CCS-OA hydrogel with the diffusion-controllable manner at initial phase followed by the corrosion manner of hydrogel at terminal phase. In vivo wound healing study was performed by injecting hydrogels on rat dorsal wounds. Histological study revealed that application of nano-curcumin/CCS-OA hydrogel could significantly enhance the re-epithelialization of epidermis and collagen deposition in the wound tissue. DNA, protein and hydroxyproline content in wound tissue from each group were measured on 7th day of post wounding and the results also indicated that combined using nano-curcumin and CCS-OA hydrogel could significantly accelerate the process of wound healing. Therefore, all these results suggested that the developed nano-curcumin/CCS-OA hydrogel as a promising wound dressing might have potential application in the wound healing. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Based on it, the hydrophilic QDs were incorporated into multilayer films by layer-by-layer self-assembly. It was found that the as-prepared nanocomposite presented high photostability and allowed highly sensitive and selective determination of copper(II) ions. Under optimum conditions, the FL quenching effect of low concentrations of copper(II) ions could be well described by Langmuir-type binding isotherm in the range from 0.02 to 1.0 μM, with a detection limit of 8.0 nM. Furthermore, at low concentration levels, it was observed that the FL intensity of nanocomposite could recover to optimal level with the attenuation rate less than 5.8% for five "on-off-on" times. At high concentrations, the FL responses fitted fairly well to the typical Stern-Volmer equation range from 1.0 to 30 μM, while the quenching process turned out to be irreversible. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

0037045225	Simultaneous determination of chlorinated organic compounds from environmental samples using gas chromatography coupled with a micro electron capture detector and micro-plasma atomic emission detector	Water and sediment samples were screened simultaneously for the presence of polychlorinated organic compounds using gas chromatography (GC) coupled with an micro electron capture detector (μ-ECD) and a newly developed helium plasma based on a micro-atomic emission detector (μ-AED). The GC column effluent was split 15:85 between two detectors. In this way, two chromatograms, one obtained by μ-ECD and another by μ-AED, were recorded simultaneously. α-, β-hexachlorocyclohexane and p,p′-DDE were detected. RSDs of the monitoring results from the two detection methods were < 20% for the three compounds. A detection limit of 8.5 pg and at least 3 orders of magnitude of linear range for μ-AED was observed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

0037291483	Determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in water by capillary solid-phase microextraction coupled to high performance liquid chromatography	Capillary solid-phase microextraction, a sample preparation technique, was established and applied to the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in water by coupling to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The analytes were extracted onto the polymer film of a piece of gas chromatographic capillary and desorpted into HPLC injector by a small amount of organic solvent. The limits of detection for anthracene, fluoranthene and 1,2-benzanthracene were 0.9 μg/L, 0.7 μg/L and 0.1 μg/L respectively. Good reproducibility was obtained with RSD ranging from 5.1% to 6.3% for 10 μg/L spiked samples (n = 7).

84869470444	Colloidal graphene as a transducer in homogeneous fluorescence-based immunosensor for rapid and sensitive analysis of microcystin-LR	Herein, we reported the assembly of colloidal graphene (CG) and microcystin (MC)-LR-DNA bioconjugates to develop a homogeneous competitive fluorescence-based immunoassay for rapid and sensitive detection of MC-LR in water samples. Initially, the MC-LR-DNA probe was quickly adsorbed onto the CG surface through the strong noncovalent π-π stacking interactions and can be effectively quenched benefiting from the high quenching efficiency of CG. In contrast, the competitive binding of anti-MC-LR with MC-LR-DNA destroyed the graphene/MC-LR-DNA interaction, thus resulting in the restoration of fluorescence signal. This signal transduction mechanism made it possible for analysis of the target MC-LR. Taking advantage of the colloidal nature of the as-prepared graphene, the assay was carried out in homogeneous solution throughout, which avoided numerous immobilization, incubation, and washing steps that were necessary to traditional heterogeneous immunoassays, thereby reducing the whole assay time (within less than 35 min) and allowing a much better antigen-antibody interaction. Moreover, due to the direct competitive mode, the assay did not involve any antibody labeling or modification process, which would be beneficial to preserve the binding affinity of antigen-antibody. Under optimal conditions, the proposed immunosensor can be applied for quantitative analysis of MC-LR with a detection limit of 0.14 μg/L, which satisfied the World Health Organization (WHO) provisional guideline limit of 1 μg/L for MC-LR in drinking water, thus providing a powerful tool for rapid and sensitive monitoring of MC-LR in environmental samples. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84872850931	Growth of tungsten oxide on carbon nanowalls templates	In the present work we present a simple approach for coupling tungsten oxide with carbon nanowalls. The two-dimensional carbon nanowalls with open boundaries were grown using plasma enhanced hot filament chemical vapor deposition, and the subsequent tungsten oxide growth was performed in the same equipment by direct heating of a tungsten filament. The tungsten oxide coating is found to have uniform morphology with a crystalline structure of monoclinic tungsten trioxide. Surface photoelectric voltage measurements show that this product has photoresponse properties. The method of synthesis described here provides an operable route to the production of two-dimensional tungsten oxide nanocomposites. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84873303644	Evaluation of removal efficiency for acute toxicity and genotoxicity on zebrafish in anoxic-oxic process from selected municipal wastewater treatment plants	The anoxic-oxic (A/O) process has been extensively applied for simultaneous removal of organic contaminants and nitrogen in wastewater treatment. However, very little is known about its ability to remove toxic materials. Municipal wastewater contains various kinds of pollutants, some of which have recalcitrant genotoxicity and may cause potential threat to environment, and even can lead to extinction of many species. In this study, we have selected three municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) employing anoxic-oxic (A/O) process to evaluate their ability to remove acute toxicity and genotoxicity of wastewater. Mortality rate of zebrafish (Danio rerio) was used to evaluate acute toxicity, while micronucleus (MN) and comet assays were used to detect genotoxicity. Results showed that in this process the acute toxicity was completely removed as the treatment proceeded along with decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) (<50mgL

84876307620	Hierarchically porous silicon with significantly improved photocatalytic oxidation capability for phenol degradation	In this work, hierarchically porous silicon was fabricated through electro-assisted chemical etching using a silicon wafer as a substrate. Pores with an average diameter of ca. 1200. nm (macropores) were observed and a large number of nanopores with a diameter of less than 5. nm were uniformly distributed over the surface of the macropore, forming the hierarchically porous silicon with nanopores in macropores structure (NP-MPSi). UV-vis diffuse reflection measurements indicated that NP-MPSi has a bandgap of 2.12. eV, which is 1.0. eV higher than that of the original silicon wafer because of the quantum confinement effect caused by the nanopores. Mott-Schottky experiments further demonstrated that the increase in bandgap of NP-MPSi arises from a positive shift of the valence band potential, which improves its capability for photocatalytic oxidation. NP-MPSi exhibited higher photoelectrochemical stability than macroporous silicon (MPSi), a comparison sample lacking nanopores. Using phenol as an example, photocatalytic experiments under irradiation with a Xe lamp demonstrated that the kinetic constants of phenol degradation and total organic carbon removal using NP-MPSi were nearly 3.5 and 8.0 times larger, respectively, than those using MPSi. This unique porous silicon material is therefore an attractive photocatalyst for environmental applications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we synthesized boron and nitrogen codoped nanodiamond (BND) as a highly efficient metal-free catalyst for ORR under alkaline conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrated that B and N atoms have been incorporated in the diamond. The resultant BND was found to be advantageous over N- or B-doped diamond for ORR in terms of current density and peak potential, highlighting the synergetic effects of codoping with B and N. Meanwhile, BND outperformed the commercial Pt/C catalyst in terms of kinetic current density, stability, and methanol tolerance.

0344197512	Optimization of Accelerated Solvent Extraction for the Determination of Chlorinated Pesticides from Animal Feed	In the present study accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) was investigated for the extraction of organochlarine pesticides from animal feed. The factors influencing the extraction efficiency including extraction temperature, stotic extraction time and composition of extraction solvent were optimized using response surface methods. Clean-up of the extracts was performed by a two-step procedure including silica gel adsorption and gel permeation chromatography. Finally, the target compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometric detection. In addition, the complete analytical procedure was validated by parallel analysis of the certified reference material BCR 115. The results were in good accordance with the certified values. ASE could provide excellent extraction efficiency and good reproducibility in short time and with reduced organic solvent consumption.

84889587137	Atomic single layer graphitic-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>: Fabrication and its high photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation	Solar energy is ideal for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. For efficient utilization of solar energy, the development of a high-activity and low-cost visible light driven photocatalyst is desired. Here we report a new type of atomic single layer graphitic-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> (SL g-C <inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>) as a high-performance photocatalyst for pollutant degradation under visible light (λ > 400 nm) irradiation. This SL g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> with thickness of 0.4-0.5 nm was prepared by an ultrasonic exfoliating process employing few layer graphitic-C<inf>3</inf>N <inf>4</inf> nanosheets (g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> NS) as precursors. As a result of this atomic single layer, prolonged photogenerated charge lifetime and improved charge transfer capability were confirmed by time-resolved fluorescence emission spectra and electrochemical measurements, respectively. During the photocatalytic process under visible light irradiation, the degradation rate of rhodamine B on SL g-C<inf>3</inf>N4 was about 3.0 and 10.2 times higher than that of the few layer g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> NS and the bulk g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>, respectively. This high photocatalytic performance is attributed to the atomic single layer structure of SL g-C <inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>, which lengthens the lifetime of photogenerated charges and serves as an excellent electron transporter. The excellent performance achieved in this work suggests very appealing applications of SL g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> in many areas, such as photocatalytic degradation of environmental pollutants, solar cell, photocatalytic water splitting and electronic nanodevices. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014.

84890778710	Nitrogen-doped diamond electrode shows high performance for electrochemical reduction of nitrobenzene	Effective electrode materials are critical to electrochemical reduction, which is a promising method to pre-treat anti-oxidative and bio-refractory wastewater. Herein, nitrogen-doped diamond (NDD) electrodes that possess superior electrocatalytic properties for reduction were fabricated by microwave-plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition technology. Nitrobenzene (NB) was chosen as the probe compound to investigate the material's electro-reduction activity. The effects of potential, electrolyte concentration and pH on NB reduction and aniline (AN) formation efficiencies were studied. NDD exhibited high electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for reduction of NB to AN. The NB removal efficiency and AN formation efficiency were 96.5% and 88.4% under optimal conditions, respectively; these values were 1.13 and 3.38 times higher than those of graphite electrodes. Coulombic efficiencies for NB removal and AN formation were 27.7% and 26.1%, respectively; these values were 4.70 and 16.6 times higher than those of graphite electrodes under identical conditions. LC-MS analysis revealed that the dominant reduction pathway on the NDD electrode was NB to phenylhydroxylamine (PHA) to AN. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84892771780	Effects of solvents and temperature on the luminescence properties of Cd-isonicotinic acid frameworks based on mono-, bi-, and trinuclear cluster units	In this work, we present the synthesis of three novel 3D Cd(ii) coordination polymers, {[Cd(IN)<inf>2</inf>]·H<inf>2</inf>O}<inf>n</inf> (1), [Cd<inf>2</inf>(IN)<inf>2</inf>(SO<inf>4</inf>)(DMF)<inf>2</inf>] <inf>n</inf> (2) and {[Cd<inf>3</inf>(IN)<inf>5.5</inf>]·0.5OH <sup>-</sup>}<inf>n</inf> (3) (HIN = isonicotinic acid). Coordination polymers 1 and 2 were obtained via solvothermal reactions. The synthesis of coordination polymer 3 was realized by a simple temperature induced single crystal to single crystal transition from 1. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that 1-3 exhibit three different structural types: 1 displays a (6,3)-connected rtl net with the Schläfli symbol (4·6<sup>2</sup>)<inf>2</inf> (4<sup>2</sup>·6<sup>10</sup>·8<sup>3</sup>) constructed from mononuclear [CdO<inf>4</inf>N<inf>2</inf>] clusters with the help of HIN. 2 is defined as a 6-connected pcu net with the Schläfli symbol {4 <sup>12</sup>·6<sup>3</sup>} which is built from binuclear [Cd <inf>2</inf>(SO<inf>2</inf>)<inf>2</inf>] clusters and HIN linkers. 3 can be regarded as a 9-connected ncd net with the Schläfli symbol {3 <sup>6</sup>·4<sup>22</sup>·5<sup>8</sup>}, which consists of paddlewheel trinuclear [Cd<inf>3</inf>(O<inf>2</inf>C)<inf>5</inf>] clusters and a bridging HIN. Coordination polymers 1-3 display luminescence with emission maxima containing deep blue, blue, light blue and green at 298 K or 77 K both in solvents (polarity: DMF > CH<inf>3</inf>OH > CH<inf>2</inf>Cl <inf>2</inf>) and in the solid state.

84896827587	Study on energy-saving electronic water treatment facility with automatically adjustable operating voltage	When wastewater is treated with an electronic water treatment method, hardness, alkalinity and conductivity of the wastewater decrease much slower with time on. If the operating voltage of wastewater treatment is reduced at this time, the purpose of energy saving can be realized while wastewater treatment efficiency is guaranteed. Existing electronic water treatment facilities always realize water treatment with constant low voltages and almost all of them have no optimal design about energy saving, water treatment system rust reduction, water treatment automation, etc. To solve these problems, a new energy-saving electronic water treatment facility is designed in this paper. Based on a low-power SCM MPS430F169 and circuits such as the water treatment voltage control circuit and the voltage and current sampling circuit, the facility establishes a closed-loop system with functions of water quality monitoring and automatic water treatment voltage adjustment. Experimental results show that the facility can realize real-time water quality monitoring in the process of wastewater treatment and automatically adjust operating voltage in line with the water quality, thus significantly reducing unnecessary energy consumption. The facility can be used in fields such as industrial circulating water treatment. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84899698331	Reduction of acute toxicity and genotoxicity of dye effluent using Fenton-coagulation process	Dye wastewater exhibits significant ecotoxicity even though its physico-chemical parameters meet the discharge standards. In this work, the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of dye effluent were tested, and the Fenton-coagulation process was carried out to detoxify this dye effluent. The acute toxicity was evaluated according to the mortality rate of zebrafish, and genotoxicity was evaluated by micronucleus (MN) and comet assays. Removal of color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) was also investigated. The results indicated that the dye effluent showed strong acute toxicity and genotoxicity to zebrafish. After 4. h of treatment by Fenton-coagulation process, the dye effluent exhibited no significant acute toxicity and genotoxicity to zebrafish. In addition, its COD was less than 50. mg/L, which met the discharge standard. It demonstrates that Fenton-coagulation process can comprehensively reduce the acute toxicity and genotoxicity as well as the COD of the dye effluent. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84902274089	Role of nitrite ions and natural organic matters as photosensitizers on photolysis of phenol	Nitrite and natural organic matters (NOM) are well known to be involved in photochemical processes occurring in natural waters. In this study, phenol is chosen as model molecule to investigate the role of nitrite ions or NOM towards the transformation of organic matters in aqueous solutions under simulated sunlight irradiation. All experiments were performed in pure water at pH 7. The results indicated that phenol phototransformation rate increased with increasing nitrite or NOM concentrations as expected. And •OH radical was demonstrated to be the main relative free radical according to the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and isopropanol quenching experiments. But unexpectedly, the presence of NOM would inhibit nitrite ions-sensitized photolysis of phenol, and it might be attributed to the ROS quenching and light screening effect of NOM. The results imply that for accurate ecological risk assessment of organic pollutants, the integrated effect of water constituent on the environmental photochemical behavior of organic pollutants should not be ignored. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84903631365	Electrochemically enhanced adsorption of PFOA and PFOS on multiwalled carbon nanotubes in continuous flow mode	It is important to develop efficient technologies on removal of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) from water due to their wide distribution and potential threat to human health. In this work, a durable and convenient electrosorption device was designed in continuous flow mode to investigate the adsorption of PFOX (X = A and S) on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) from water under electrochemical assistance. The electrosorption experiments were conducted under different influent and electrolyte concentrations, hydraulic retention time (HRT) and electrode distance to optimize the operation. The results showed that the highest removal efficiencies toward both PFOA and PFOS could come up to 90 % at 1 V. Compared with open circuit (OC) adsorption under the same conditions, the removal efficiencies were improved by 4.9 times (PFOA) and 4.2 times (PFOS) respectively. In addition, the MWNTs electrode was found to be reusable. These findings provide an efficient method to remove PFOX from water by electrosorption in continuous flow mode. © 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ZIF-8 was synthesized from nontoxic zinc ions and 2-methylimidazole in aqueous solution at room temperature. The morphology, microstructure, stability and photoluminescence properties of the material were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and fluorometric analysis techniques. The results showed that the obtained material had a uniform particle size, possessed excellent thermal and structural stability and had good luminescent properties. Under the optimized conditions, the photoluminescent intensity of the guest-free phase ZIF-8 was linear with formaldehyde concentration in two intervals, 0-0.5 ppm and 0.5-20 ppm, with corresponding correlative coefficients of 0.9991 and 0.9819, respectively. The limit of detection for gaseous formaldehyde was calculated to be 0.057 ppm (3δ per slope criterion). Moreover, other indoor pollutants, such as benzene, toluene, methanol and ethanol, which can be emitted from indoor decorative materials, showed little interference with the photoluminescence intensity of this platform during the determination process. The material exhibits great potential in the field of rapid, convenient and highly sensitive detection of indoor gaseous formaldehyde. © the Partner Organisations 2014.

10344247131	Complexes of fulvic acid on hematite interfaces: Characterization and photochemical properties	Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), combined with ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and transmission electron micrograph (TEM), has been used to observe the interaction between fulvic acid (FA) and hematite. The FTIR data have shown that the interaction mechanism corresponds mainly to the ligand-exchange involving carboxylic functional groups of the FA and hematite surface sites. The general trends included an increase in the content of Fe(III)-humate complexes on hematite surfaces accompanied by a decrease in pH and an increasing in the ionic strength. Both UV-Vis spectroscopy and TEM images have shown that hematite can interplay with FA under acidic conditions. In particular, the TEM images have shown that the presence of FA can significantly alter the characteristics of the hematite surfaces. Photochemical experiments have shown that hematite promotes the phototransformation of lindane (γ-HCH), whereas the presence of FA adversely affects the phototransformation of the target pollutant. The hematite coated with FA displayed a somewhat better catalyzing capability compared to the hematite only.
