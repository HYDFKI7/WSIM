Then a DCT-based phase-unwrapping algorithm is proposed. The former two algorithms were proved to enjoy an obvious advantage in processing phase maps with much stochastic noise. Their final unwrapped-phase results are very close to the ideal ones. But, there appear some big errors in unwrapping the experimental phase map with large gradient and some inconsistent regions. It is hard for them to achieve a reasonable solution. In this case, the DCT-based algorithm can make up the above disadvantages and is able to achieve a reliable solution even though the experimental phase map is destroyed by sharp variance or discontinuities. and it boasts a little higher computation speed. Therefore, in application, most problems are expected to be solved smoothly by way of Schofield's 4-FFT algorithm integrated with DCT-based one.

67649613326	New composite quality map for phase reconstructing algorithm in optical measurement	Optical phase measurement depends on the phase reconstruction from fringe patterns to a great extent. Phase reconstruction means to eliminate the discontinuity of phase extracted from fringe patterns. Most phase-reconstructing (PR) algorithms might share a common research interest, namely, to construct an excellent phase-evaluating mechanism-quality map. Hence two kinds of experimental fringe patterns are studied for 3D measurement. It's found that the gradient variance of log modulation amplitude (GVLMA) could be chosen as a phase indicator. Its reliability could be compared to the traditional phase derivative variance (PDV) quality map. Generally, it's advised to choose the GVLMA as a guide or weight of PR. For further application, a new composite quality map (log modulation amplitude and phase derivative variance (LMAPDV) has been proposed. It combines the GVLMA and PDV and optimizes the parameter of combination. The LMAPDV could identify the minute defect or badness of phase data which could hardly be recognized by the PDV. Moreover, its identified outlines of poor pixels are much clearer than those of PDV and GVLMA. Then the LMAPDV is introduced into the PR algorithm. The calculated result proves that its solution enjoys higher consistency than that of GVLMA.

81555207909	Studies on mega-pixel cell phone lenses based on aspheric optics	According to the principle of optical design, two kinds of 2 Mega-pixel cell phone camera lenses are proposed. One is made up of three plastic (3P) lenses; the other is made up of two plastic lenses and one glass (2P1G) lens. The shapes of all lenses are aspheric. By comparison, the overall length of 2P1G lens is much less than that of 3P lens. Furthermore, in FOV the former is 5°larger than the latter. At the same time, in distortion of the maximum field angle, the former is much less. The other aberrations of 2P1G lens are almost same to those of 3P lens. Therefore, in cell phone camera lens design, it's recommended to adopt one aspheric glass lens to improve the performance and compactness though the cost will become a little higher due to the introduction of aspheric glass lens. However, the cost of aspheric glass lens could be reduced tremendously by a new cost-effective manufacturing method compression molding technology. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

84860159140	Ultra-wide car lens optimization based on low-Tg aspheric glass	Car camera lens is widely used for the safety system of all kinds of vehicles. The car lens should have very wide field angle, strong ability to endure vibration and thermo-mechanical instability as well as erosion. According to these requirements, a new car lens is designed based on the aspheric glass lenses. The whole structure of car lens contains six separated glass lenses including two aspheric lenses. To reduce the cost, the aspheric lenses are made from low-Tg glass which is adaptable for mass production by glass molding press. The total track of lens is less than 30mm. For the enhancement of night vision, the F-number is set to be 2.4. The full FOV (field of view) of 160° is wide enough to capture all the dangerous information around the car. The imaging resolution is designed to be 3 Mega pixels. The designed result proves that the new car lens features high imaging quality. Its MTF (modulation transfer function) value is not less than 0.15 at the Nyquist frequency as for the field angle of 160°. At the half Nyquist frequency, the MTF values of the most field angles are not less than 0.5. Therefore, the new lens could be used in the front of car to monitoring the dangerous cases around the corner. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

84862917409	Surface measurement methods based on single and multi-frequency fringes and its applications in reverse engineering	The 3D surface measurement methods are described based on the single and multi-frame fringe projection principles, respectively. The key algorithm - phase reconstructing (PR) is conducted by means of two different concepts; one is the single-frequency spatial phase reconstructing method and the other is the multi-frequency temporal one. On the side of spatial PR, a few typical methods are carried out, among which the most robust one could be achieved. The described spatial methods are implemented under the guide of the suggested modulation gradient variance (MGV) map. Moreover, the network programming (NP) method is also conducted to compare with them. The tested results show that the weighted least square (WLS) is the most robust one among the spatial PR methods. At the same time, the temporal PR method is introduced based on the multi-frequency fringes, and the result proves that it features the better noise immunity and robustness than spatial ones, but needs many different frequencies of fringes that would be more time-consuming. Lastly, the surfaces are reconstructed in reverse engineering (RE) software. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84863042216	Universal interferometer based on dynamically-adjusted fringe periods	A universal interferometer is proposed to realize the eyeballed evaluation and accurate measurement of many kinds of optical elements with different structures and shapes, such as lenses and crystals. In the interferometer, a pair of optical wedges are used to adjust the fringe periods dynamically to implement the measurement in real time. The interferometer takes two Jamin glass plates as a main structure, between which two pairs of optical wedges are laid. All wedges are completely identical in sizes and can be revolved along the axis. The relationship between the relative angle of two wedges and the fringe period is established, and then a real time testing experiment of domain reverse in an optical crystal is introduced to test the performance of the interferometer. The experimental result shows that the measurement accuracy is about 0.2 rad in phase (λ/30), and the adjustment range of fringe period (white & black fringe) is from 0.105 to 5.993 mm/pair. In the interferometer, the relative angle between the two wedges along the same optical axis can be adjusted from 0° to 179°. The interferometer is charaterized by the symmetrical optical structure, so that it has high stability and can endure strong noise and vibration. It can modulate the fringe period in real time to meet requirements of various optical structures and can reach high measurement accuracy.

Glass molding press (GMP) has been employed as a promising technique to manufacture optical components in mass production. Heating time and annealing time are the key factors which influence the production cycle. In this paper, an effective method of improving the heating or the annealing effectiveness is to increase the area exposed to the cooling or hot nitrogen by means of adding slots. In the same condition, four models with different slots were built.
