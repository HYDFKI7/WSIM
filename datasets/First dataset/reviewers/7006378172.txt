84928614287	Risk factors and natural history of breast cancer in younger Chinese women	AIM: To investigate the age differences in the risk factors, clinicopathological characteristics and patterns of treatment of female breast cancer patients. METHODS: Seven thousand one hundred and fiftytwo women with primary breast cancer from the Hong Kong Breast Cancer Registry were recruited after receiving patients' consent, they were asked to complete standardized questionnaires which captured their sociodemographic characteristics and risk factors associated with breast cancer development. Among them, clinicopathological data and patterns of treatment were further collected from medical records of 5523 patients with invasive breast cancers. Patients were divided into two groups according to the age at diagnosis: younger (< 40 years old) vs older patients (= 40 years old) for subsequent analyses. RESULTS: Analysis on the sociodemographic characteristics and exposure to risk factors were performed on 7152 women with primary breast cancer and the results revealed that younger patients were more likely to have unhealthy lifestyles; these include a lack of exercise (85.4% vs 73.2%, P < 0.001), having high stress in life (46.1% vs 35.5%, P < 0.001), having dairy/meat-rich diets (20.2% vs 12.9%, P < 0.001), having alcohol drinking habit (7.7% vs 5.2%, P = 0.002). Younger patients were also more likely to have hormone-related risk factors including nulliparity (43.3% vs 17.8%, P < 0.001) and an early age at menarche (20.7% vs 13.2%, P < 0.001). Analyses on clinicopathological characteristics and patterns of treatment were performed on 5523 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. The invasive tumours in younger patients showed more aggressive pathological features such as having a higher percentage of grade 3 histology (45.7% vs 36.5%, P < 0.001), having a higher proportion of tumours with lymphovascular invasion (39.6% vs 33.2%, P = 0.003), and having multifocal disease (15.7% vs 10.3%, P < 0.001); they received different patterns of treatment than their older counterparts. CONCLUSION: Younger patients in Hong Kong are more likely to encounter risk factors associated with breast cancer development and have more aggressive tumours than their older counterparts.

8544260317	Comparison of CT and MR imaging for the detection of extranodal neoplastic spread in metastatic neck nodes	Purpose: To compare computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for the detection of extranodal neoplastic spread (ENS) in metastatic cervical nodes from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Materials and methods: 17 patients with a squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck underwent CT and MR imaging. The neck nodes were assessed for ENS and the results compared using pathology from the surgical resection. Results: Radiologic-pathologic correlation was performed in 51 malignant nodes. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were respectively 73, 65, 93% for CT, and 80, 78, 86% for MR imaging. Comparison of CT and MR imaging showed that there was no significant difference between the two modalities for either sensitivity (P=0.1317) or specificity (P=0.3173). Conclusion: CT and MR imaging are comparable for the detection of ENS. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

9444277289	Hepatitis B reactivation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing systemic chemotherapy	Background: Cancer patients who are hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers and undergoing chemotherapy (CT) may be complicated by HBV reactivation. Over 80% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients are HBV carriers; however, the incidence of HBV reactivation during CT has not been well-reported. A prospective study was conducted to determine the incidence of HBV reactivation, the associated morbidity and mortality, and possible risk factors. Patients and methods: 102 HBsAg-positive patients with inoperable HCC underwent systemic CT. Patients received either combination cisplatin, interferon, doxorubicin and fluorouracil (PIAF) or single-agent doxorubicin. They were followed up during and for 8 weeks after CT. Results: In 102 patients, 59 (58%) developed hepatitis amongst whom 37 (36%) were attributable to HBV reactivation. Twelve (30%) died of HBV reactivation. CT was interrupted in 32 patients (86%) with reactivation and 54 (83%) without reactivation (P>0.05). The median survivals were 6.00 and 5.62 months, respectively (P=0.694). Elevated baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was found to be a risk factor. Conclusion: HBV reactivation is a common cause of liver damage during CT in HBsAg-positive HCC patients. The only identifiable associated risk factor was elevated pre-treatment ALT. Further studies into the role of antiviral and novel anticancer therapies are required to improve the prognosis of these patients. © 2004 European Society for Medical Oncology.

1542503712	Lamivudine for the prevention of hepatitis B virus reactivation in hepatitis B s-antigen seropositive cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy	Purpose: For cancer patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation is a well described complication resulting in varying degrees of liver damage. The objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy of the antiviral agent lamivudine in reducing the incidence of HBV reactivation and diminishing morbidity and mortality of cancer patients with chronic HBV infection during chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: Two groups were compared in this nonrandomized study. The prophylactic lamivudine group consisted of 65 patients in a phase II study who were treated with lamivudine before and until 8 weeks after discontinuing chemotherapy. The historical controls consisted of 193 consecutive patients who underwent chemotherapy without prophylactic lamivudine. Significant prognosticators for the development of HBV reactivation were determined based on data from the controls. Potential confounding factors were identified between the two groups. The outcomes were compared. Results: In the controls, lymphoma and anthracycline usage were factors identified to be associated with reactivation. The two groups were comparable in most baseline characteristics, although in the prophylactic lamivudine group, there were significantly more patients with lymphoma and receiving anthracyclines. In the prophylactic lamivudine group, there was significantly less HBV reactivation (4.6% v 24.4% in the controls; P < .001), fewer incidences of hepatitis (17.5% v 44.6%; P < .0001) that were less severe (4.8% v 18.7%; P = .0005), and less disruption of chemotherapy (15.4% v 34.6%; P = .0029). The reduction in overall mortality was not statistically different. Conclusion: Prophylactic lamivudine significantly reduced the incidence of HBV reactivation and the overall morbidity of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. © 2004 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

17844396455	Survival outcome of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma with first local failure: A study by the Hong Kong nasopharyngeal carcinoma study group	Background. The purpose of this article is to report the overall survival (OS) outcome of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with local failure who received salvage treatment and to identify prognostic factors for OS. Methods. Between January 1996 and December 2000, 2915 patients received primary radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy for nonmetastatic NPC. At a median follow-up of 3.1 years, 319 patients had developed local failure as the first failure, with or without synchronous regional/distant failure. OS was calculated from the start of primary RT. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for OS in patients with isolated local failure. Results. The T classification distribution of the local failure (rT classification) was as follows: 68 (21%) rT1 to T2a, 92 (29%) rT2b, 82 (26%) rT3, and 77 (24%) rT4. The rT classification was the same as the initial T classification in 82% of patients. Two hundred seventy-five patients (86%) had isolated local failure, and 232 (84%) of them did not have any distant metastasis or regional failure develop during follow-up. Salvage treatment was given to 200 patients (73%) with isolated local failure. One hundred fifty-nine patients (80%) received reirradiation (108 external beam RT [EBRT], 44 brachytherapy, and seven EBRT plus brachytherapy), 22 patients (11%) underwent nasopharyngectomy with or without postoperative RT, and 19 patients (9%) were treated with chemotherapy alone. Four patients died of RT complications, and one died of chemotherapy toxicity in the absence of active NPC. The 3-year actuarial OS for patients with isolated local failure was 74%. On multivariate analysis, advanced initial T classification (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; p = .0006) and the use of salvage treatment (HR, 0.54; p = .0038) were independent prognostic factors. For the subgroups of patients who had the same recurrent and initial T classification, salvage treatment was associated with improved OS only in the subgroup with T1 to T2 local failure (n = 127; p = 0.0446), but not in the subgroups with T3 (n = 48) or T4 (n = 54) disease. Conclusions. Most patients with first local failure have localized disease. Salvage treatment is feasible in most of the patients with clinically isolated local failure. Patients who had early initial T classification have a more favorable prognosis. Subgroup analysis suggests that salvage treatment only prolongs survival in patients with T1 to T2 recurrent disease. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

20044378115	Treatment results for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the modern era: The Hong Kong experience	Purpose: To analyze the treatment results achievable for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the modern era to identify the key failures for future improvement and to provide an updated baseline for future trials. Methods and Results: The results of 2687 consecutive patients treated at all public oncology centers in Hong Kong during 1996-2000 were retrospectively analyzed. The stage distribution (by American Joint Committee on Cancer and International Union Against Cancer staging system, 1997) was 7% Stage I, 41% Stage II, 25% Stage III, and 28% Stage IVA-B. All patients were irradiated with 6-MV photons and the median total dose was 66 Gy. Only 23% of patients had additional treatment with chemotherapy. Results: The 5-year local, nodal, and distant failure-free rates were 85%, 94%, and 81%, respectively; patients with local failure had significantly higher risk of nodal and distant failures. The 5-year progression-free, overall, and cancer-specific survival rates were 63%, 75%, and 80%, respectively. The presenting stage was the most important prognostic factor for all endpoints: with overall survival decreasing from 90% for Stage I to 58% for Stage IVA-B. The results achieved by the 2070 patients treated by radiotherapy alone were almost identical to that of the whole series, the distant failure-free rate among patients with locoregional control was 89% for Stage I-II and 75% for Stage III-IVB. The 860 patients (32%) staged with magnetic resonance imaging achieved significantly better results than those staged by computed tomography, the overall survival being 93% vs. 83% for Stages I-II, and 72% vs. 63% for Stages III-IVB (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Treatment results for nasopharyngeal carcinoma have substantially improved in the modern era; future trials should be based on updated baseline results. Further reduction of distant failure is important for future breakthrough, particularly for patients with advanced disease. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

2342560548	Comprehensive analysis of risk factors associating with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy	For cancer patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy, HBV reactivation is a well-described complication, which may result in varying degrees of liver damage. Several clinical features and the pre-chemotherapy HBV viral load have been suggested to be associated with an increased risk of developing the condition: (I) to assess the clinical and virological factors in a comprehensive manner and thereby identify those that are associated with the development of HBV reactivation; (2) to develop a predictive model to quantify the risk of HBV reactivation. In all, 138 consecutive cancer patients who were HBV carriers and undergoing chemotherapy were studied, of which 128 patients had sera available for real-time PCR HBV DNA measurement They were followed up throughout their course of chemotherapy and the HBV reactivation rate was determined. The clinical and virological features between those who did and did not develop viral reactivation were compared. These included age, sex, baseline liver function tests, HBeAg status and viral load (HBV DNA) prior to the chemotherapy, and the use of specific cytotoxic agents. In all, 36 (26%) developed HBV reactivation. Multivariate analysis revealed pre-chemotherapy HBV DNA level, the use of steroids and a diagnosis of lymphoma or breast cancer to be significant factors. Based on real-time HBV DNA PCR assay, detectable baseline HBV DNA prior to the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy, the use of steroids and a diagnosis of lymphoma or breast cancer are predictive factors for the development of HBV reactivation. A predictive model was developed from the current data, based on a logistic regression method. © 2004 Cancer Research UK.

2542519941	Staging of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Suggestions for improving the current UICC/AJCC Staging System	Aims: To evaluate the current UICC/AJCC Staging System for nasopharyngeal carcinoma and to search for ways of improving the system. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective analysis of 2687 consecutive patients treated in five public centres in Hong Kong during the period 1996-2000. All patients were staged by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or both. The prognostic significance of the current stage assignment on various aspects of tumour control was evaluated. Results: T-category, N-category and stage-group were all significant prognostic factors for major end points (P<0.01). However, the distinction of prognosis between Stage I and II was insignificant (5-year cancer-specific survival being 92% vs 95%; P=0.13). Multivariate analyses (corrected for age and sex) revealed lack of significance between T2a and T1 in hazards of local and distant failures, N3a and N2 in distant failure and subgroups of T1-2N0 in cancer-specific deaths. Corresponding down-staging of T2a to T1, N3a to N2, and subgroup T2N0 to stage I, resulted in more even and orderly increase in the hazard ratio of cancer-specific deaths (from 1 for stage I to 1.98 for II, 3.5 for III, 6.08 for IVA and 8.62 for IVB), better hazard consistency among subgroups of the same stage and more balanced stage distribution. Conclusions: The current UICC/AJCC staging System could be further improved by the modifications suggested; validation of the current proposal by external data is urgently awaited. © 2004 The Royal College of Radiologists.

27144557565	A randomized phase III study of doxorubicin versus cisplatin/interferon α-2b/doxorubicin/fluorouracil (PIAF) combination chemotherapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma	Background: Single-agent doxorubicin has been widely used to treat unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the response rate is low (<20%) and there is no convincing evidence for improved survival. Cisplatin, interferon, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (PIAF) used in combination, by contrast, has shown promise in a phase II study. We compared doxorubicin to PIAF in patients with unresectable HCC in a phase III trial. Methods: Patients with histologically confirmed unrese ctable HCC were randomly assigned to receive either doxorubicin or PIAF every 3 weeks, for up to six cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival, and secondary endpoints were response rate and toxicity. Survival differences were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Treatment groups were compared for differences in the incidence of adverse events using chi-square tests. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: The median survival of the doxorubicin and PIAF groups was 6.83 months (95% confidence [CI] = 4.80 to 9.56) and 8.67 months (95% CI = 6.36 to 12.00), respectively (P = 0.83). The hazard ratio for death from any cause in the PIAF compared with the doxorubicin groups was 0.97 (95% CI = 0.71 to 1.32). Eighty-six of the 94 patients receiving doxorubicin and 91 of the 94 receiving PIAF were assessable for response. The overall response rates in the doxorubicin and PIAF groups were 10.5% (95% CI = 3.9% to 16.9%) and 20.9% (95% CI = 12.5% to 29.2%), respectively. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hypokalemia were statistically significantly more common in patients treated with PIAF than in patients treated with doxorubicin. Conclusion: Although patients on PIAF had a higher overall response rate and better survival than patients on doxorubicin, the differences were not statistically significant. PIAF was also associated with increased treatment-related toxicity. The prognosis of patients with unresectable HCC remains poor. © The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.

3042737594	Lung metastasis alone in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A relatively favorable prognostic group: A study by the Hong Kong Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Study Group	BACKGROUND. The current study was conducted to examine the pattern and the predictive factors of distant metastases (DM) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after primary radiotherapy treatment. METHODS. Data from all five regional cancer centers in Hong Kong were collected retrospectively and pooled for the current study, which was coordinated by the Hong Kong Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Study Group. The sample was comprised of all 2915 patients with NPC without DM at the time of presentation who were treated with radiotherapy in 1 of the 5 cancer centers during the period between January 1996 and December 2000. RESULTS. DM was found to be the leading cause of NPC failure, with a 5-year actuarial rate of 14.9% in this patient cohort. Despite the poor overall survival (OS) of these patients, those with lung metastasis alone represented a distinctive group associated with a significantly better OS. International Union Against Cancer (UICC) N classification, UICC T classification, advanced age, and male gender were found to be significant and independent determinants for DM. CONCLUSIONS. Long-term survival is possible in patients with distant metastatic NPC confined to the lung. An aggressive approach to treatment for this group of patients should be considered. © 2004 American Cancer Society.

30444438409	Correlation and prognostic significance of beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase and serum monosialylated alpha-fetoprotein in hepatocellular carcinoma	Aim: To investigate the correlation between tissue ST6Gal I and serum msAFP in HCC patients, and to investigate their prognostic significance. Methods: Preoperative sera, paired tumorous and non-tumorous tissues were collected from 19 consecutive patients who had undergone surgical resection of HCC. ST6Gal I activities in the tissues were measured by an in vitro microsomal enzyme activity assay. The percentages of tumor-specific msAFP in the sera were also estimated by an isoelectric focusing-immunoblotting assay. Results: The tumor ST6Gal I activity was negatively correlated with serum msAFP percentage (r = -0.53, P = 0.019). Both decreased tumor ST6Gal I activity and increased serum msAFP percentage were associated with poor tumor cell differentiation. Univariate analyses showed that both decreased tumor ST6Gal I activity (P = 0.028), increased serum msAFP percentage (P = 0.034) and poor tumor cell differentiation (P = 0.031) were associated with shorter overall survival. Multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model showed that the preoperative serum msAFP percentage (P = 0.022) and tumor cell differentiation status (P = 0.048) were independent prognostic indicators for patient overall survival. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the presence of msAFP in blood circulation is associated with a decreased activity of ST6Gal I activity in HCC. Both tissue ST6Gal I and serum msAFP are potential prognostic markers for patients with operable HCC. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33745591930	Quality of life is predictive of survival in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma	Background: Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have a dismal prognosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether patient-reported baseline quality of life (QoL) measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 instrument is predictive of survival for these patients. Materials and methods: Two hundred and thirty-three patients with unresectable HCC (mainly hepatitis B-associated) who were recruited into two separate randomized phase III clinical studies, based on palliative chemotherapy and palliative hormonal therapy, respectively, gave consent and received pretreatment QoL assessment. EORTC QLQ-C30 scores and clinical variables at the time of study entry were analyzed to identify factors that influenced survival by applying multivariate analysis. Independent prognostic factors for survival were studied by Cox regression analysis. Results: Median survival of the 233 patients was 5.5 months (95% CI 4.2-6.5 months). Significant independent predictors of shorter survival were advanced Okuda staging (P = 0.0030; HR = 2.058), high baseline total bilirubin (P = 0.0008; HR = 1.013) and worse QoL score in the appetite score domain (P = 0.0028; HR for 10 point increase = 1.070). Patients who were entered into the chemotherapy trial (P = 0.0002; HR = 0.503), those who scored better in the physical functioning domain (P = 0.0034; HR for 10 point decrease = 0.911) and the role functioning domain (P = 0.0383; HR for 10 point decrease = 0.944) of the QoL questionnaire, were associated with longer survival. Conclusions: In the studied HCC population, patient-reported baseline QoL provides additional prognostic information that supplements traditional clinical factors, and is a new prognostic marker for survival for patients with unresectable HCC. © 2006 European Society for Medical Oncology.

33747874526	Dose-response relationship of nasopharyngeal carcinoma above conventional tumoricidal level: A study by the Hong Kong nasopharyngeal carcinoma study group (HKNPCSG)	Background and purpose: To define the dose-response relationship of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) above the conventional tumoricidal dose level of 66 Gy when the basic radiotherapy (RT) course was given by the 2D Ho's technique. Patients and methods: Data from all five regional cancer centers in Hong Kong were pooled for this retrospective study. All patients (n=2426) were treated with curative-intent RT with or without chemotherapy between 1996 and 2000 with the basic RT course using the Ho's technique. The primary endpoint was local control. The prognostic significance of dose-escalation ('boost') after 66 Gy, T-stage, N-stage, use of chemotherapy, sex and age (≤40 years vs >40 years) was studied. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: On multivariate analysis, T-stage (P< 0.01; hazard ratio [HR], 1.58) and optimal boost (P=0.01; HR, 0.34) were the only significant factors affecting local failure for the whole study population, and for the population of patients treated by radiotherapy alone, but not for patients who also received chemotherapy. The following were independent determinants of local failure for patient groups with different T-stages treated by radiotherapy alone: use of a boost in T1/T2a disease (P=0.01; HR, 0.33); use of a boost (P<0.01; HR, 0.60) and age (P=0.01; HR, 1.02) in T3/T4 tumors. Among patients with T2b tumors treated by radiotherapy alone and given a boost, the use of a 20 Gy-boost gave a lower local failure rate than a 10 Gy-boost. There was no apparent excess mortality attributed to RT complications. Conclusions: Within the context of a multi-center retrospective study, dose-escalation above 66 Gy significantly improved local control for T1/T2a and T3/4 tumors when the primary RT course was based on the 2D Ho's technique without additional chemotherapy. 'Boosting' in NPC warrants further investigation. Caution should be taken when boosting is considered because of possible increase in radiation toxicity. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

33748775184	Effectiveness of telephone counselling by a pharmacist in reducing mortality in patients receiving polypharmacy: Randomised controlled trial	Objective: To investigate the effects of compliance and periodic telephone counselling by a pharmacist on mortality in patients receiving polypharmacy. Design: Two year randomised controlled trial. Setting: Hospital medical clinic. Participants: 502 of 1011 patients receiving five or more drugs for chronic disease found to be non-compliant at the screening visit were invited for randomisation to either the telephone counselling group (n = 219) or control group (n = 223) at enrolment 12-16 weeks later. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome was all cause mortality in randomised patients. Associations between compliance and mortality in the entire cohort of 1011 patients were also examined. Patients were defined as compliant with a drug if they took 80-120% of the prescribed daily dose. To calculate a compliance score for the whole treatment regimen, the number of drugs that the patient was fully compliant with was divided by the total number of prescribed drugs and expressed as a percentage. Only patients who complied with all recommended drugs were considered compliant (100% score). Results: 60 of the 502 eligible patients defaulted and only 442 patients were randomised. After two years, 31 (52%) of the defaulters had died, 38 (17%) of the control group had died, and 25 (11%) of the intervention group had died. After adjustment for confounders, telephone counselling was associated with a 41% reduction in the risk of death (relative risk 0.59.95% confidence interval 0.35 to 0.97; P = 0.039). The number needed to treat to prevent one death at two years was 16. Other predictors included old age, living alone, rate of admission to hospital, compliance score, number of drugs for chronic disease, and non-treatment with lipid lowering drugs at screening visit. In the cohort of 1011 patients, the adjusted relative risk for death was 1.61 (1.05 to 2.48; P = 0.029) and 2.87 (1.80 to 2.57; P < 0.001) in patients with compliance scores of 34-66% and 0-33% compared with those who had a compliance score of 67% or more. Conclusion: In patients receiving polypharmacy, poor compliance was associated with increased mortality. Periodic telephone counselling by the pharmacist improved compliance and reduced mortality.

33751256026	Role of laboratory variables in differentiating SARS-coronavirus from other causes of community-acquired pneumonia within the first 72 h of hospitalization	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) testing be considered in epidemiologically high-risk patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) if no alternative diagnosis is identified after 72 h. The aim of this study was to identify routine laboratory variables that might indicate the need for SARS-CoV testing. Routine hematological/biochemical variables in patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS (2003) were compared with those in consecutive patients hospitalized June-December 2004 with radiologically confirmed CAP. Stepwise logistic regression analyses were performed to identify discriminating variables at baseline and by day 3 of hospitalization. Nasopharyngeal aspiration and antigen detection for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were routinely performed in patients with CAP. Altogether, 181 patients with CAP (who remained undiagnosed by IFA) and 303 patients with SARS were studied. The mean intervals from symptom onset to admission were 3.1 and 2.8 days, respectively (p>0.05). The etiological agent of CAP was identified retrospectively in only 39% of cases, the majority being bacterial pathogens. At baseline, age and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) were the only independent discriminating variables (p<0.0001). Using a value of <4.4 × 10

33845873055	Irofulven as first line therapy in recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer: A phase II multicenter study by the Cancer Therapeutics Research Group (CTRG)	Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of irofulven, a DNA interacting acylfulvene analog, as first line therapy for patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer. Patients and methods: Twenty-three patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer received irofulven at a dose of 0.45 mg/kg administered intravenously over 30-min infusion (up to a maximum of 50 mg), on days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks. Results: The median number of cycles delivered per patient was 2 (range 1-6). Two patients (9%) had ≥1-week delay in administration of subsequent cycle of chemotherapy. For the day 8 chemotherapy, dose reductions were required in seven patients (30%); dose omitting occurred in five patients (22%). Grade 3/4 anemia and neutropenia occurred in 22 and 17% of patients, respectively. There was no grade 4 thrombocytopenia and no neutropenic fever was observed. Of the 20 evaluable patients, there were no responses observed, 3 patients had stable disease after 2 cycles of treatment which was not confirmed by a further assessment. Median overall survival was 6.05 months (95% CI 4.55-9.39). Conclusions: Irofulven was tolerated at the dose of 0.45 mg/kg on days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks but showed no evidence of antitumor activity in patients with advanced gastric cancer. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

33847742531	Plasma Epstein-Barr viral deoxyribonucleic acid quantitation complements tumor-node-metastasis staging prognostication in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Purpose: To evaluate the effect of combining circulating Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) DNA load data with TNM staging data in pretherapy prognostication of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients and Methods: Three hundred seventy-six patients with all stages of NPC were studied. Pretreatment plasma/ serum EBV DNA concentrations were quantified by a polymerase chain reaction assay. Determinants of overall survival were assessed by multivariate analysis. Survival probabilities of patient groups, segregated by clinical stage (I, II, III, or IV) alone and also according to EBV DNA load (low or high), were compared. Results: Pretherapy circulating EBV DNA load is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in NPC. Patients with early-stage disease were segregated by EBV DNA levels into a poor-risk subgroup with survival similar to that of stage III disease and a good-risk subgroup with survival similar to stage I disease. Conclusion: Pretherapy circulating EBV DNA load is an independent prognostic factor to International Union Against Cancer (UICC) staging in NPC. Combined interpretation of EBV DNA data with UICC staging data leads to alteration of risk definition of patient subsets, with improved risk discrimination in early-stage disease. Validation studies are awaited. © 2006 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

34047111338	A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized study of Chinese herbal medicine as complementary therapy for reduction of chemotherapy-induced toxicity	Background: Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is a common complementary therapy used by patients with cancer for reduction of chemotherapy-induced toxic effects. This study applied the highest standard of clinical trial methodology to examine the role of CHM in reducing chemotherapy-induced toxicity, while maintaining a tailored approach to therapy. Patients and methods: Patients with early-stage breast or colon cancer who required postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy were eligible for the study. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to one of three Chinese herbalists who evaluated and prescribed a combination of single-item packaged herbal extract granules. Patients received either CHM or placebo packages with a corresponding serial number. The placebo package contained nontherapeutic herbs with an artificial smell and taste similar to a typical herbal tea. The primary end points were hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2. Results: One hundred and twenty patients were accrued at the time of premature study termination. Patient characteristics of the two groups were similar. The incidence of grade 3/4 anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia for the CHM and placebo groups were 5.4%, 47.3%, 52.7%, and 1.8% and 1.8%, 32.2%, 44.7%, and 3.6%, respectively (P = 0.27, 0.37, 0.63, and 0.13, respectively). Incidence of grade 2 nausea was the only non-hematologic toxicity that was significantly reduced in the CHM group (14.6% versus 35.7%, P = 0.04). Conclusions: Traditional CHM does not reduce the hematologic toxicity associated with chemotherapy. CHM, however, does have a significant impact on control of nausea. © 2007 Oxford University Press.

34447273156	Effects of soy isoflavone supplementation on cognitive function in Chinese postmenopausal women: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial	Objective: To investigate whether soy-derived isoflavone extract improves performance in cognitive function and quality of life in Chinese postmenopausal women. Design: The study was a 6-month double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. Participants were community-dwelling women aged 55 to 76 years; 191 eligible women were randomly assigned to receive a daily oral intake of 80 mg soy-derived isoflavones or an identical-appearing placebo for 6 months. Standardized neuropsychological tests of memory, executive function, attention, motor control, language, and visual perception and a global cognitive function assessment were administered face-to-face individually at baseline and at 6-months posttreatment. The validated Chinese version of the Short Form-36 was used for quality of life measurements. Results: Of the participants, 88% (168 women: 80 among the supplementation group and 88 among the placebo group) completed the trial. Intention-to-treat analysis, conducted for 176 participants with 6-month assessment results, revealed no significant differences in outcome measures between treatment groups. Subgroup analysis among the good compliers only (consumed at least 80% of the supplements or placebo; n = 168) and among the age groups younger or older than 65 years also indicated no significant differences for any outcome measures. Types of complaints of adverse events were similar in both treatment groups and included mainly gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal problems. Conclusions: This 6-month trial indicates that 80-mg soy-derived isoflavone supplementation did not improve performance on standard neuropsychological tests and overall quality of life in generally healthy Chinese postmenopausal women. © 2007 by The North American Menopause Society.

34547889915	Nasopharyngeal Cancers: Which Method Should be Used to Measure these Irregularly Shaped Tumors on Cross-Sectional Imaging?	Purpose: To determine whether the standard techniques of measuring tumor size and change in size after treatment could be applied to the measurement of nasopharyngeal cancers, which are often irregular in shape. Methods and Materials: The standard measurements of bidimensional (BDM) (World Health Organization criteria) and unidimensional (UDM) (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria), together with the maximum depth of the tumor perpendicular to the pharyngeal wall (DM), were acquired from axial magnetic resonance images of primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma in 44 patients at diagnosis and in 29 of these patients after treatment. Tumor volume measurements (VM), acquired from the summation of areas from the axial magnetic resonance images, were used as the reference standard. Results: There was a significant association between VM and BDM with respect to tumor size at diagnosis (p = 0.002), absolute change in tumor size after treatment (p < 0.001), and percentage change in tumor size after treatment (p = 0.044), but not between VM and UDM. There was also a significant association between VM and DM with respect to percentage change in tumor size after treatment (p = <0.0001) but not absolute change (p = 0.222). Conclusion: When using simple measurements to assess irregularly shaped nasopharyngeal cancers, the BDM should be used to measure size at diagnosis and the BDM and percentage change in size with treatment. Unidimensional measurement does not reflect size or change in size, and therefore the RECIST criteria may not be applicable to all tumor shapes. The use of DM requires further evaluation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

34548727890	Digital PCR for the molecular detection of fetal chromosomal aneuploidy	Trisomy 21 is the most common reason that women opt for prenatal diagnosis. Conventional prenatal diagnostic methods involve the sampling of fetal materials by invasive procedures such as amniocentesis. Screening by ultrasonography and biochemical markers have been used to risk-stratify pregnant women before definitive invasive diagnostic procedures. However, these screening methods generally target epiphenomena, such as nuchal translucency, associated with trisomy 21. It would be ideal if noninvasive genetic methods were available for the direct detection of the core pathology of trisomy 21. Here we outline an approach using digital PCR for the noninvasive detection of fetal trisomy 21 by analysis of fetal nucleic acids in maternal plasma. First, we demonstrate the use of digital PCR to determine the allelic imbalance of a SNP on PLAC4 mRNA, a placenta-expressed transcript on chromosome 21, in the maternal plasma of women bearing trisomy 21 fetuses. We named this the digital RNA SNP strategy. Second, we developed a nonpolymorphism-based method for the noninvasive prenatal detection of trisomy 21. We named this the digital relative chromosome dosage (RCD) method. Digital RCD involves the direct assessment of whether the total copy number of chromosome 21 in a sample containing fetal DNA is overrepresented with respect to a reference chromosome. Even without elaborate instrumentation, digital RCD allows the detection of trisomy 21 in samples containing 25% fetal DNA. We applied the sequential probability ratio test to interpret the digital PCR data. Computer simulation and empirical validation confirmed the high accuracy of the disease classification algorithm. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

36849010786	Prospective randomized study of intensity-modulated radiotherapy on salivary gland function in early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients	Purpose: This randomized trial compared the rates of delayed xerostomia between two-dimensional radiation therapy (2DRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in the treatment of early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients and Methods: Between November 2001 and December 2003, 60 patients with T1-2bN0-1M0 NPC were randomly assigned to receive either IMRT or 2DRT. Primary end point was incidence of observer-rated severe xerostomia at 1 year after treatment based on Radiotherapy Oncology Group /European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Parallel assessment with patient-reported outcome, stimulated parotid flow rate (SPFR), and stimulated whole saliva flow rate (SWSFR) were also made. Results: At 1 year after treatment, patients in IMRT arm had lower incidence of observer-rated severe xerostomia than patients in the 2DRT arm (39.3% v 82.1%; P = .001), parallel with a higher fractional SPFR (0.90 v 0.05; P < .0001), and higher fractional SWSFR (0.41 v 0.20; P = .001). As for patient's subjective feeling, although a trend of improvement in patient-reported outcome was observed after IMRT, recovery was incomplete and there was no significant difference in patient-reported outcome between the two arms. Conclusion: IMRT is superior to 2DRT in preserving parotid function and results in less severe delayed xerostomia in the treatment of early-stage NPC. Incomplete improvement in patient's subjective xerostomia with parotid-sparing IMRT reflects the need to enhance protection of other salivary glands. © 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

36248991885	Curcumin effects on blood lipid profile in a 6-month human study	Studies in animals and a short-term human study have suggested that curcumin, a polyphenolic compound concentrated in the curry spice turmeric, decreases serum cholesterol concentration. However, no controlled human trials have examined the effect of curcumin on cholesterol. This study investigated the effects of consuming curcumin on the serum lipid profile in men and women. Elderly subjects (n = 36) consumed 4 g/d curcumin, 1 g/d curcumin, or placebo in a 6-month, randomized, double-blind trial. Plasma curcumin and its metabolites were measured at 1 month, and the serum lipid profile was measured at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months. The plasma curcumin concentration reached a mean of 490 nmol/L. The curcumin concentration was greater after capsule than powder administration. Consumption of either dose of curcumin did not significantly affect triacylglycerols, or total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol over 1 month or 6 months. However, the concentrations of plasma curcumin and serum cholesterol were positively and significantly correlated. Curcumin consumption does not appear to have a significant effect on the serum lipid profile, unless the absorbed concentration of curcumin is considered, in which case curcumin may modestly increase cholesterol. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

0033804328	Frequency of hepatitis B virus reactivation in cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy: A prospective study of 626 patients with identification of risk factors	Hepatitus B virus (HBV) reactivation is a welldescribed complication in cancer patients who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and may result in varying degrees of liver damage. As chemotherapy is used increasingly in cancer patients, HBV reactivation during cytotoxic treatment may become a more common problem. In lymphoma patients, the incidence of chronic HBV infection has been reported to be 26%, of whom 47% developed HBV reactivation during chemotherapy. However, corresponding data for patients with other malignancies undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy are not known. In this prospective study, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was determined in 626 consecutive cancer patients who received cytotoxic chemotherapy over a 12-month period. Seventy-eight patients (12%) were found to be HBsAg positive. Thirty-four (44%) developed raised alanine transaminase during their course of chemotherapy. In these 34 patients, hepatitis was attributed to HBV reactivation in 15 patients (44%), chronic active HBV infection in 1 patient (3%), hepatitis C infection in 1 patient (3%), malignant hepatic infiltration in 2 patients (6%), and the use of hepatotoxic chemotherapeutic agents in 11 patients (32%). The causes of hepatitis were unknown in 4 patients (12%). HBV reactivation was more likely to develop in patients who were male, younger age, HBeAg seropositive, and those with lymphoma. Presence of malignant hepatic infiltration, baseline pre-treatment alanine transaminase, total bilirubin, and HBV DNA levels did not correlate with the development of HBV reactivation. Of the 15 patients who developed HBV reactivation, antiviral therapy with lamivudine was available and used in 9. There was no HBV-related mortality during chemotherapy. It is concluded that in patients with chronic HBV infection under chemotherapy, HBV reactivation occurs in nearly 20% of them and accounts for 44% of hepatitis cases. The risk factors identified include male sex, younger age, HBeAg seropositive, and the diagnosis of lymphoma. In HBV endemic areas, patients with risk factors for HBV reactivation should be identified prior to receiving cytotoxic treatment and monitored closely. The potential benefit of lamivudine requires further confirmation. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss Inc.

38349192891	Is topical antimycotic treatment useful as adjuvant therapy for flexural atopic dermatitis: Randomized, double-blind, controlled trial using one side of the elbow or knee as a control	Background: Certain factors are known to cause exacerbation of atopic dermatitis (AD), e.g. soap, detergent, dry skin, staphylococcal colonization, and herpes infection. Other factors are suspected, but not yet proven, e.g. yeasts belonging to the Malassezia genus. It is known that antimycotics may be beneficial in a small subset of adult patients with dermatitis affecting the head and neck region; however, it is not known whether AD patients, many of whom also have head and neck involvement, may also find antimycotics useful. A previous study has demonstrated no treatment difference in adult AD patients; however, the measurement method was criticized and 1% hydrocortisone cream may have too weak an effect in adult patients. Therefore, we designed this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to examine this question. Younger AD patients were recruited and different methods of measuring outcomes were used. Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of topical antimycotic treatment as adjuvant therapy for flexural AD. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in AD patients using one side of the elbow or knee as a control. There were three independent outcomes: (i) to compare the ability to relieve symptoms; (ii) to compare the ability to improve clinical signs; and (iii) to compare the ability to provide lasting clinical effects. Results: All three outcomes showed unequivocally that the addition of antimycotic did not provide extra benefit to the standard treatment. Conclusion: The addition of antimycotic does not seem to provide extra benefit to AD patients, and the beneficial effect of this medication seems to be restricted to a small subset of adult patients with dermatitis affecting the head and neck region. © 2008 The International Society of Dermatology.

32944479876	An intensive surveillance program detected a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma among hepatitis B virus carriers with abnormal alpha-fetoprotein levels or abdominal ultrasonography results	Purpose: To study the incidence and treatment outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detected in an intensive surveillance program (ISP) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. Patients and Methods: We screened 1,018 HBV carriers by serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) measurement and abdominal ultrasonography (AUS). Patients with an abnormal AFP level or AUS result were enrolled in an ISP that included Lipiodol computed tomography followed by AFP measurement/AUS every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter. The rest were on routine surveillance for 2 years. Results: A total of 9,849 serum AFP measurements and 3,053 AUSs were performed. After a median follow-up of 4.12 years, we diagnosed 24 HCCs among 78 patients with abnormal screening test results at enrollment (group A); 23 HCCs among 93 patients with only abnormal surveillance test results during follow-up (group B); and nine HCCs among 847 patients with 2 years of normal surveillance (group C). Annual incidence of HCC in the ISP was 760.2 (95% CI, 538.4 to 1,073.7) per 100,000. Mean tumor sizes were 3.02, 2.91, and 4.82 cm in groups A, B, and C, respectively (P = .01). Tumor resection rate of the ISP was 36.2%, although another 29.8% of the patients were eligible for locoregional ablative therapy. Conclusion: This study illustrated that a high incidence of relatively small HCCs may be detected by using intensive surveillance of high-risk HBV carriers. However, the surgical resection rate was low, and we were not able to demonstrate clinical benefit with the early detection. Future surveillance studies should consider incorporation of therapy aimed at long-term control of small-sized tumors. © 2005 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

33644874070	A comparison of wound treatments in nasopharyngeal cancer patients receiving radiation therapy	The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of gentian violet and nonadherent absorbent dressing in the healing of postirradiation wounds in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. This was a randomized controlled trial. A sample of 146 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who had developed postirradiation wounds was assessed. Comparisons were made regarding parameters related to wound healing, including healing time, presence of infection, and wound pain, and also regarding the impact of wound on the patient, including mood changes, restriction of neck movement, social isolation, sleep problem, and disturbance in body image. The results showed that patients in the 2 groups did not have any significant difference on wound-healing time, disturbance in mood, sleep, social interaction, appearance, and neck mobility. However, there was a trend of higher wound pain score, not reaching statistical significance, in the gentian violet group. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

40549137513	A multicenter phase II trial of 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP, Triapine®) and gemcitabine in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with pharmacokinetic evaluation using peripheral blood mononuclear cells	Background: We tested the hypothesis that 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP, Triapine®) may enhance response to re-treatment with gemcitabine by enhancing intracellular uptake of gemcitabine in a phase II study. Method: Patients who had prior exposure to gemcitabine as a first-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were given weekly infusions of 3-AP and gemcitabine for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest, repeated every 28 days. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected to evaluate the effect of 3-AP on pharmacokinetics and intracellular uptake of gemcitabine. Result: Twelve patients were treated with a median of two treatment cycles without objective response, hence the study was terminated at interim analysis. Four patients had stable disease and the median time to progression was 3 months (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.7 to 9.1 months). Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (two patients), hypoxia (three patients) and dyspnea (one patient). Four patients developed reversible symptomatic methemoglobinemia during 3-AP infusion, with mild to moderately elevated methemoglobin levels that ranged from 7.8 to 17.6% of the total hemoglobin concentration. Limited pharmacokinetic data did not suggest any clinically relevant pharmacological influence of 3-AP on gemcitabine. Conclusion: 3-AP did not enhance clinical response to gemcitabine in this cohort of patients with prior exposure to gemcitabine for advanced NSCLC. Further development of 3-AP in lung cancer is challenged by its potential of causing methemoglobinemia and hypoxia, which could be problematic in patients with compromised pulmonary reserves. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

58149490683	Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aneuploidy by massively parallel genomic sequencing of DNA in maternal plasma	Chromosomal aneuploidy is the major reason why couples opt for prenatal diagnosis. Current methods for definitive diagnosis rely on invasive procedures, such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis, and are associated with a risk of fetal miscarriage. Fetal DNA has been found in maternal plasma but exists as a minor fraction among a high background of maternal DNA. Hence, quantitative perturbations caused by an aneuploid chromosome in the fetal genome to the overall representation of sequences from that chromosome in maternal plasma would be small. Even with highly precise single molecule counting methods such as digital PCR, a large number of DNA molecules and hence maternal plasma volume would need to be analyzed to achieve the necessary analytical precision. Here we reasoned that instead of using approaches that target specific gene loci, the use of a locus-independent method would greatly increase the number of target molecules from the aneuploid chromosome that could be analyzed within the same fixed volume of plasma. Hence,we used massively parallel genomic sequencing to quantify maternal plasma DNA sequences for the noninvasive prenatal detection of fetal trisomy 21. Twenty-eight first and second trimester maternal plasma samples were tested. All 14 trisomy 21 fetuses and 14 euploid fetuses were correctly identified. Massively parallel plasma DNA sequencing represents a new approach that is potentially applicable to all pregnancies for the noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

0034332923	Improved local control for early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma - A tale of two hospitals	Purpose: To study the efficacy of intracavitary brachytherapy (ICT) in early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods and materials: All early T-stage (T1 and T2 nasal cavity tumour) NPC treated with a curative intent up to 1996 were analyzed (n=743), 163 from the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) and 25 from Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH) were given ICT after radical external radiotherapy (ERT; group A). They were compared with 555 patients treated with ERT alone (group B). The radiotherapy techniques were identical between the two hospitals. The ERT delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected biological equivalent dose (BED)-10, ≥75 Gy) to the primary tumour, and this did not differ in technique or dosage between the two groups. The ICT delivered a dose of 18-24 Gy in three fractions over 15 days to a point 1 cm perpendicular to the midpoint of the plane of the sources. Results: The local failure was significantly less (crude rates, 6.9 vs. 13.0%; 5-year actuarial rates, 5.8 vs. 11.7%) and the disease-specific mortality was significantly lower (crude rates, 13.8 vs. 18.9%; 5-year actuarial rates, 12.2 vs. 15.2%) in group A compared with group B. ICT was the only significant independent prognostic factor predictive of fewer local failures. When ICT was excluded from the Cox regression model, the total physical dose or the total BED-10 uncorrected for tumour repopulation became significant in predicting the ultimate local failure rate. The two groups were comparable in the rate of the chronic radiation complications. A significant dose-tumour-control relationship existed, plotting the local failure as a function of the total physical dose or the total BED. Conclusions: Supplementing ERT, which delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected BED-10, ≥75 Gy), with ICT significantly enhanced ultimate local control in early T-stage (T1/T2 nasal infiltration) NPC. A significant dose-tumour-control relationship exists above the conventional tumoricidal dose level. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

79952328642	Primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Diagnostic accuracy of MR imaging versus that of endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy	Purpose: To compare the accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with that of the current clinical standard of endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy, to determine whether MR imaging depicts subclinical cancers missed at endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy, and to determine whether MR imaging can identify patients without nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who do not need to undergo invasive sampling biopsy. Materials and Methods: The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board; written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients suspected of having NPC underwent MR imaging, endoscopy, and endoscopic biopsy. Endoscopic biopsy targeted the suspected tumor or sampled the endoscopically normal nasopharynx. The final diagnosis was based on results of the endoscopic biopsy or on results of a repeat biopsy directed at the lesion detected at MR imaging. The sensitivity and specificity of the three investigations were compared by using the Fisher exact test. Results: NPC was present in 77 (31%) of 246 patients and absent in 169 (69%) patients. The combined sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, respectively, were 100%, 93%, and 95% for MR imaging, 90%, 93%, and 92% for endoscopy, and 95%, 100%, and 98% for endoscopic biopsy. Benign disease was mistaken for NPC in 12 (7%) of 169 patients at MR imaging and in 11 (6%) patients at endoscopy. The sensitivity of MR imaging was significantly higher than that of endoscopy (P = .006) and was similar to that of endoscopic biopsy (P = .120). The specificity of MR imaging was similar to that of endoscopy (P = .120) and was significantly lower than that of endoscopic biopsy (P < .001). Conclusion: MR imaging is an accurate test for the diagnosis of NPC. MR imaging depicts subclinical cancers missed at endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy and helps identify the majority of patients who do not have NPC and who therefore do not need to undergo invasive sampling biopsies. © RSNA, 2010.

84897096567	Estimating the incidence reporting rates of new influenza pandemics at an early stage using travel data from the source country	SUMMARY During the surveillance of influenza pandemics, underreported data are a public health challenge that complicates the understanding of pandemic threats and can undermine mitigation efforts. We propose a method to estimate incidence reporting rates at early stages of new influenza pandemics using 2009 pandemic H1N1 as an example. Routine surveillance data and statistics of travellers arriving from Mexico were used. Our method incorporates changes in reporting rates such as linearly increasing trends due to the enhanced surveillance. From our results, the reporting rate was estimated at 0.46% during early stages of the pandemic in Mexico. We estimated cumulative incidence in the Mexican population to be 0.7% compared to 0.003% reported by officials in Mexico at the end of April. This method could be useful in estimation of actual cases during new influenza pandemics for policy makers to better determine appropriate control measures. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

42149109105	A phase II study of patients with metastatic or locoregionally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma and evaluation of plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA as a biomarker of efficacy	Background: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is commonly overexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and gefitinib inhibits NPC growth in vitro. Method: Patients who progressed after prior platinum-based chemotherapy for recurrent NPC were given gefitinib orally at 500 mg/day at a 28-day cycle. Plasma Epstein-Barr virus (pEBV) DNA levels were obtained at specific intervals. Results: Sixteen patients enrolled and 15 were evaluable for response. The median age was 49 years (range 34-64 years), and most patients were males with metastatic NPC. No objective response was seen and three patients had stable disease (SD) for 2.8 to 8.5 months. Radiological progression of disease coincided with rising levels of pEBV DNA in most patients, while the level of a patient with the longest duration of SD fell to an undetectable level at study completion. The mean time to progression and overall survival was 2.7 (standard error, SE +/- 0.5 months) and 12 months (SE +/- 1.7 months), respectively. No unexpected drug-related toxicities were seen. The study was prematurely terminated because there was insufficient activity to warrant progression to the second stage of accrual. Conclusion: This study found limited activity of gefitinib in recurrent NPC. Further evaluation of pEBV DNA as a biomarker of response in clinical trials of target-based agents is warranted. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

57849138923	Factors related to sexual health in Chinese women with breast cancer in Hong Kong	Aim: To examine the association between a broad array of characteristics and sexuality in breast cancer patients in Hong Kong. Method: We collected data on demographic and clinical factors, psychosocial well-being, quality of life (QOL), body image and sexual health of breast cancer patients presented to the Department of Clinical Oncology, Prince of Wales Hospital from November 2005 to February 2006. Results: More than 40% of Chinese breast cancer patients experienced moderate problems in sexual health. Their medical treatment had a greater influence on their sexual functioning in a change in their social activities, whereas more support from their partner predicted less influence. The presence of a child and more support from their partner predicted greater sexual satisfaction. Undergoing the menopause related to a longer time to resume sexual activity after cancer treatment. A change of relationship with their partner and a loss of self-confidence were strong predictors of sexual problems influencing their QOL. Patients who had experienced a change in their relationship with their partner or had greater sexual problems were more likely to perceive greater benefit from professional intervention on sexual problem. Conclusion: An improvement in their intimate relationships and enhanced psychosocial functioning should improve the sexual health of Chinese women with breast cancer. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

7044238395	Development of a questionnaire module to supplement the EORTC QLQ-C30 to assess quality of life in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, the EORTC QLQ-HCC18	Measurement of quality of life (QoL) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires assessment of factors related to chronic liver disease, as well as issues related to the primary tumour and its treatment. This study describes the development of a questionnaire module in patients from Europe, as well as Taiwan and Hong Kong. The questionnaire was developed according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QoL Group guidelines. Twenty nine QoL issues were identified from a literature search. Semi-structured interviews with patients (n = 32) and health-care professionals (n = 10) reduced the issues to 22 items forming a provisional questionnaire. This was tested in 158 patients from three countries. Descriptive statistics and clinical judgement reduced the module to 18 items conceptualised as containing six scales and two single item. This study recommends the EORTC QLQ-HCC18 to accompany the QLQ-C30 to measure QoL in clinical trials in HCC. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

71049134768	Multicenter phase II study of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma - Correlation with excision repair cross-complementing-1 polymorphisms	Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a platinum-sensitive cancer and excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) polymorphisms have been shown to predict survival in several cancers following platinum therapy. Patients and methods: This multicenter study evaluated the activity of oxaliplatin and prolonged infusion of gemcitabine ('GEMOX' regimen) in recurrent NPC. Baseline blood samples were genotyped for the presence of ERCC1-118 gene polymorphisms. Results: Forty-two patients were recruited, of whom most (61%) had metastatic disease. Of the 40 patients evaluated for response, the respective overall response and disease control rates were 56.1% and 90.2%. At a median follow-up of 14.8 months, the respective median overall survival and time to progression were 19.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI) = 12.8-22 months] and 9 months (95% CI = 7.3-10 months). Grade 3-4 toxic effects were uncommon. The distribution of ERCC1-118 genotypes from 29 patients was C/C (n = 17, 40.5%), C/T (n = 10, 23.8%) and T/T (n = 2, 4.8%). No differences in survival or response rates were found between genotypes. Conclusions: GEMOX is active in the treatment of recurrent NPC. Detection of single-nucleotide gene polymorphisms from genomic DNA in peripheral blood is feasible in NPC and further studies are warranted. © The Author 2009.

0035057567	Determination of RhD zygosity: Comparison of a double amplification refractory mutation system approach and a multiplex real-time quantitative PCR approach	Background: Rh isoimmunization and hemolytic disease of the newborn still occur despite the availability of Rh immunoglobulin. For the prenatal investigation of sensitized RhD-negative pregnant women, determination of the zygosity of the RhD-positive father has important implications. The currently available molecular methods for RhD zygosity assessment, in general, are technically demanding and labor-intensive. Therefore, at present, rhesus genotype assessment is most commonly inferred from results of serological tests. The recent elucidation of the genetic structure of the prevalent RHD deletion in Caucasians, as well as the development of real-time PCR, allowed us to explore two new approaches for the molecular determination of RhD zygosity. Methods: Two methods for RhD zygosity determination were developed. The first was based on the double Amplification Refractory Mutation System (double ARMS). The second was based on multiplex real-time quantitative PCR. For the double ARMS assay, allele-specific primers were designed to directly amplify the most prevalent RHD deletion found in RhD-negative individuals in the Caucasian population. The multiplex real-time quantitative PCR assay, on the other hand, involved coamplification and quantification of RHD-specific sequences in relation to a reference gene, albumin, in a single PCR reaction. A ratio, ΔCt, based on the threshold cycle, was then determined and reflects the RHD gene dosage. Results: The allele-specific primers of the double ARMS assay reliably amplified the RHD-deleted allele and therefore accurately distinguished homozygous from heterozygous RhD-positive samples. The results were in complete concordance with serological testing. For the multiplex real-time quantitative PCR assay, the ΔCt values clearly segregated into two distinct populations according to the RHD gene dosage, With mean values of 1.70 (SD, 0.17) and 2.62 (SD, 0.29) for the homozygous and heterozygous samples, respectively (P <0.001, t-test). The results were in complete concordance with the results of serological testing as well as with the double ARMS assay. Conclusion: Double ARMS and real-time quantitative PCR are alternative robust assays for the determination of RhD zygosity. © 2001 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

0035204677	Application of classification tree and neural network algorithms to the identification of serological liver marker profiles for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma	Objective: Although many attempts have been made to identify tumour-specific α-fetoprotein (AFP) glycoforms or other serological markers for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), none of the available markers has, so far, shown satisfactory sensitivity and specificity. Here we aimed to apply classification tree and neural network algorithms to interpret the levels of multiple serological liver markers to improve overall specificity and sensitivity, particularly with a view to discriminating between liver cirrhosis with and without HCC. Methods: We developed classification trees and neural networks that identified serological liver marker profiles comprising AFP, α1-antitrypsin (A1AT), α2-macroglobulin (A2MG), thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), transferrin and albumin as well as sex and age, which might permit the diagnosis of HCC. Data were collected from 65 HCC patients, 51 patients with liver cirrhosis alone (LC) and 51 normal healthy subjects. Results: The generated classification trees and neural networks showed similar diagnostic values in differentiating HCC from LC. The classification trees identified AFP, A1AT and albumin as the most important classification parameters, whereas the neural networks identified A2MG, AFP, A1AT and albumin as the predominant factors. The classification logic of the classification trees indicated that more HCC cases could be identified among cases with slightly elevated AFP levels by using the serum levels of A1AT and albumin. The neural networks were also useful for the identification of the HCC cases when the AFP levels were below 500 ng/ml (p < 0.005). The neural networks could identify HCC cases with AFP levels within the normal range, but the classification trees could not. By combining the conventional AFP test and the neural networks, the overall diagnostic sensitivity for HCC was significantly increased from 60.0 to 73.8% (p < 0.05) while maintaining a high specificity (88.2%). The sensitivities for tumors of different sizes were similar. Conclusion: The neural network algorithm appeared to be more powerful than the classification tree algorithm in the identification of the distinctive serological liver marker profiles for the diagnosis of the HCC subgroup without significant elevation in serum AFP levels. By incorporating serological levels of other liver markers and including data from a large number of patients and control subjects, it should prove possible to develop a versatile neural network for early diagnosis of HCC.

77749286761	Human papillomavirus DNA detection in menstrual blood from patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and condyloma acuminatum	The Papanicolaou test generates pain and embarrassment, and cytology screening has limited sensitivity for detection of cervical neoplasia. These factors urge the use of another screening test that can overcome these limitations. We explore a completely noninvasive method using detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in women's menstrual blood (MB). The participants were divided into 3 cohorts: (i) 235 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN 3) (n = 48), CIN 2 (n = 60), CIN 1 (n = 58), or condyloma acuminatum (CAC) (n = 69) before treatment or remission; (ii) from the first cohort of patients, 108 CIN 3 or CIN 2 patients after treatment and 62 CIN 1 or CAC patients after remission; and (iii) 323 apparently normal subjects (ANS) without any cervical disease. The HPV genotypes of the infected patients were confirmed by direct sequencing. Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) was used to measure the MB HPV16 load for 15 infected patients. Results showed that the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for detection of MB HPV DNA in samples from patients with CIN or CAC were 82.8%, 93.1%, 90.0%, and 87.9%, respectively. Moreover, MB HPV DNA was found in samples from 22.2% of CIN 3 or CIN 2 patients after treatment, 0.0% of CIN 1 or CAC patients after remission, and 8.1% of ANS, 4 of whom were found to have CIN 1 or CAC. Furthermore, QRT-PCR showed that the normalized MB HPV16 DNA copy numbers in samples from patients with CIN 1 to CIN 3 were significantly increased. These preliminary results suggested that MB HPV DNA is a potential noninvasive marker for these premalignant cervical diseases. Copyright © 2010, American Society for Microbiology.

77949423502	Serum zinc is decreased in Alzheimer's disease and serum arsenic correlates positively with cognitive ability	Zinc, copper, and iron aggregate Aβ and accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) plaques. Some metals are increased in AD vs. control serum. The authors examined levels of 12 metals in serum of 44 AD and 41 control subjects. Zinc decreased from 12.3 to 10.9 μmol/L (means, p = 0.0007). Arsenic positively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination score (p<0.0001). Zinc deposition in brain amyloid might deplete zinc from other body compartments, such as serum. The arsenic correlation might be caused by the major contribution of seafood consumption to intake of both arsenic and docosahexaenoic acid, of which the latter may delay AD. © Springer Science+Business Media.

77951766835	Intravenous magnesium sulphate for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (IMASH): A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III trial	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE-: Pilot clinical trials using magnesium sulfate in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage have reported trends toward improvement in clinical outcomes. This Phase III study aimed to compare intravenous magnesium sulfate infusion with saline placebo among such patients. METHODS-: We recruited patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage within 48 hours of onset from 10 participating centers. The patients were randomly assigned to magnesium sulfate infusion titrated to a serum magnesium concentration twice the baseline concentration or saline placebo for 10 to 14 days. Patients and assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. The study is registered at www.strokecenter.org/trials (as Intravenous Magnesium Sulphate for Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage [IMASH]) and www.ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00124150). RESULTS-: Of the 327 patients recruited, 169 were randomized to receive treatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate and 158 to receive saline (placebo). The proportions of patients with a favorable outcome at 6 months (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale 5 to 8) were similar, 64% in the magnesium sulfate group and 63% in the saline group (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.6). Secondary outcome analyses (modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Short Form 36, and clinical vasospasm) also showed no significant differences between the 2 groups. Predefined subgroups included age, admission World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grade, pre-existing hypertension, intracerebral hematoma, intraventricular hemorrhage, location of aneurysm, size of aneurysm, and mode of aneurysm treatment. In none of the subgroups did the magnesium sulfate group show a better outcome at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS-: The results do not support a clinical benefit of intravenous magnesium sulfate infusion over placebo infusion in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.

79551633705	Intravenous magnesium sulphate for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: An updated systemic review and meta-analysis	Introduction: Previous meta-analyses of magnesium sulphate infusion in the treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) have become outdated due to recently published clinical trials. Our aim was thus to perform an up-to-date systemic review and meta-analysis of published data on the use of magnesium sulphate infusion in aneurysmal SAH patients.Methods: A systemic review and meta-analysis of the literature was carried out on published randomized controlled clinical trials that investigated the efficacy of magnesium sulphate infusion in aneurysmal SAH patients. The results were analyzed with regard to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), delayed cerebral infarction, and favorable neurological outcomes at three and six months. The risks of bias were assessed using the Jadad criteria, with a Jadad score >3 indicating a lower such risk. Meta-analyses are presented in terms of relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: Six eligible studies with 875 patients were reviewed. The pooled RR for DCI was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.36 to 2.09; P = 0.75). That for delayed cerebral infarction was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.97; P = 0.04), although this result did not persist if only randomized clinical trials with a lower risk of bias were included (RR 0.61, 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.22; P = 0.17). The pooled RR for a favorable outcome at three months was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.31; P = 0.07), and that for a favorable outcome at six months was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.24; P = 0.29).Conclusions: The present findings do not lend support to a beneficial effect of magnesium sulphate infusion on delayed cerebral infarction. The reduction in DCI and improvement in the clinical outcomes of aneurysmal SAH patients following magnesium sulphate infusion observed in previous pilot studies are not confirmed, although a beneficial effect cannot be ruled out because of sample size limitation. © 2011 Wong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

79953056867	Association of the POU class 2 homeobox 1 gene (POU2F1) with susceptibility to Type 2 diabetes in chinese populations	Aims POU class 2 homeobox 1 (POU2F1), also known as octamer-binding transcription factor-1 (OCT-1), is a ubiquitous transcription factor that plays a key role in the regulation of genes related to inflammation and cell cycles.POU2F1 is located on chromosome 1q24, a regionwith linkage forType 2 diabetes in Chinese and other populations. We examined the association of POU2F1 genetic variants with Type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese using two independent cohorts. Methods We genotyped five haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms at POU2F1 in 1378 clinic-based patients with Type 2 diabetes and 601 control subjects, as well as 707 members from 179 families with diabetes. Results We found significant associations of rs4657652, rs7532692, rs10918682 and rs3767434 (OR = 1.26-1.59, 0.0003 < P

79955900659	Health-related quality of life after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: Profile and clinical factors	Background: Health-related quality of life has recently been suggested as a supplement to the traditional neurological outcome measures from the patient's perspective according to the World Health Organization model and may capture the effects of other factors such as posttraumatic stress disorder and neuroendocrine dysfunction. Objective: To explore the profile and clinical factors of quality of life after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage using the data we obtained from the recently completed Intravenous Magnesium Sulphate After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (IMASH) trial. Methods: This study was registered at www.strokecenter.org/trials and www.ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00124150). Data from a patient cohort obtained with the Short Form-36 questionnaire completed at 6 months were used for analysis. Results: Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage demonstrated a decrease in quality of life according to the Short Form-36 at 6 months. The physical and mental health scores correlated with the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale and had the potential to avoid the ceiling effect. Multiple regression analyses showed that the physical component scores were related to age, World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grade, and chronic hydrocephalus and that the mental component scores were not related to the traditional prognostic factors. Conclusion: Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused a decrease in quality of life. Chronic hydrocephalus is related to a decrease in physical health quality of life.

0036023422	Coexpression of hypoxia-inducible factors 1α and 2α, carbonic anhydrase IX, and vascular endothelial growth factor in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and relationship to survival	Purpose: Tumor hypoxia is known to be associated with resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and poorer survival. Recently, it is shown that hypoxia induces the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and 2α (HIF-1α and HIF-2α), which then up-regulates the expression of downstream genes such as carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Experimental Design: We examined the expression of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, CA IX, and VEGF by immunohistochemistry in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) biopsies from 90 consecutive patients recruited between 1994 and 1997 in a randomized controlled trial of chemoradiation in locally advanced NPC and investigated their relationship with survival. Results: HIF-aα was expressed in 52 of 90 (58%), HIF-2α in 6 of 89 (7 %), CA IX in 51 of 90 (57 %), and VEGF in 54 of 90 (60%) of tumors. Tumor HIF-1α expression correlated significantly with that of CA IX (P = 0.008) and VEGF (P = 0.003). High tumor HIF-1α expression was associated with a trend for poor overall survival (P = 0.06). Tumors with a positive hypoxic profile (defined as high expression of both HIF-1α and CA9) were associated with worse progression-free survival (P = 0.04). Tumors with both hypoxic and anglogenic profile (defined as high VEGF expression) were associated with a worse progression-free survival (P = 0.0095). Conclusion: Overexpression of HIF-1α, CA IX, and VEGF is common in NPC, which is probably related to hypoxia up-regulated expression involving a HIF-dependent pathway, and is associated with poor prognosis. Targeting the hypoxia pathway may be useful in the treatment of NPC.

0036682445	Quantitative measurement of post-irradiation neck fibrosis based on the young modulus: Description of a new method and clinical results	BACKGROUND. Postirradiation fibrosis is one of the most common late effects of radiation therapy for patients with head and neck carcinoma. An objective and quantitative method for its measurement is much desired, but the criteria currently used to score fibrosis are mostly semiquantitative and partially subjective. METHODS. The Young Modulus (YM) is a physical parameter that characterizes the deformability of material to stress. The authors measured the YM in soft tissues of the neck, at defined reference points, using an ultrasound probe and computer algorithm that quantified the indentation (deformation) on tissue due to a measured, applied force. One hundred five patients who had received previous radiation therapy to the entire neck were assessed, and the results were compared with the hand palpation scores and with a functional parameter represented by the range of neck rotation, and all results were correlated with symptoms. RESULTS. The YM was obtained successfully in all patients examined. It had a significant positive correlation with the palpation score and a significant negative correlation with the range of neck rotation. The YM was significantly higher on the side of the neck that received a boost dose of radiation, although the corresponding palpation scores were similar. The results of all three measurement methods were correlated with symptoms. CONCLUSIONS. Postirradiation neck fibrosis can be measured in absolute units based on the YM. The results showed a significant correlation with hand palpation scores, with restriction of neck rotation, and with symptoms. Compared with the palpation method, the YM is more quantitative, objective, focused on small subregions, and better discriminates regions subject to differential radiation dose levels. Its inclusion in the Analytic category of the Late Effects of Normal Tissues-SOMA system should be considered to facilitate comparative studies. © 2002 American Cancer Society.

79957852682	Hemorrhagic complications in a phase II study of sunitinib in patients of nasopharyngeal carcinoma who has previously received high-dose radiation	Background: We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single-agent sunitinib in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: Eligible patients had progressive disease after prior platinum-based chemotherapy. Sunitinib was given as continuous once-daily dosing of 37.5 mg in 4-week cycles until progression. Results: Thirteen patients were enrolled. Recruitment was stopped after two patients died of hemorrhagic events. All patients had previously received curative radiotherapy (RT) to nasopharynx/neck (including nine patients who had chemoradiotherapy). Patients received a median of three cycles of sunitinib. One patient was still on sunitinib with stable disease after 24 cycles. Hemorrhagic events occurred in nine patients (64%), including epistaxis in six, hemoptyses in three and hematemesis in two patients. Prior RT to thorax was significantly associated with hemoptyses (P = 0.03). Two patients with local tumor invasion into the carotid sheath developed fatal epistaxis/hematemesis within the first cycle of sunitinib, likely due to internal carotid blowout after tumor shrinkage. Conclusions: Sunitinib demonstrated modest clinical activity in heavily pretreated NPC patients. However, the high incidence of hemorrhage from the upper aerodigestive tract in NPC patients who received prior high-dose RT to the region is of concern. Direct vascular invasion by tumors appeared to increase the risk of serious bleeding. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society for Medical Oncology.

80052448364	Prediction of outcome in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia: A prospective validation of the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer risk index in a Chinese population and comparison with the Talcott model and artificial neural network	Purpose: We aimed to validate the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) risk index, and compare it with the Talcott model and artificial neural network (ANN) in predicting the outcome of febrile neutropenia in a Chinese population. Methods: We prospectively enrolled adult cancer patients who developed febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy and risk classified them according to MASCC score and Talcott model. ANN models were constructed and temporally validated in prospectively collected cohorts. Results: From October 2005 to February 2008, 227 consecutive patients were enrolled. Serious medical complications occurred in 22% of patients and 4% died. The positive predictive value of low risk prediction was 86% (95% CI=81-90%) for MASCC score≥21, 84% (79-89%) for Talcott model, and 85% (78-93%) for the best ANN model. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and misclassification rate were 81%, 60%, 52%, and 24%, respectively, for MASCC score≥21; and 50%, 72%, 33%, and 44%, respectively, for Talcott model; and 84%, 60%, 58%, and 22%, respectively, for ANN model. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.808 (95% CI=0.717-0.899) for MASCC, 0.573 (0.455-0.691) for Talcott, and 0.737 (0.633-0.841) for ANN model. In the low risk group identified by MASCC score≥21 (70% of all patients), 12.5% developed complications and 1.9% died, compared with 43.3%, and 9.0%, respectively, in the high risk group (p<0.0001). Conclusions: The MASCC risk index is prospectively validated in a Chinese population. It demonstrates a better overall performance than the Talcott model and is equivalent to ANN model. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

84859723697	Ultra-early (within 24 Hours) aneurysm treatment after subarachnoid hemorrhage	Background: The timing of definitive aneurysm treatment (coiling or clipping) in acute aneurysm subarachnoid hemorrhage was a subject of controversy. Although most vascular neurosurgeons agreed on early aneurysm treatment (within the first 72 hours), whether ultra-early aneurysm treatment (within the first 24 hours) was beneficial remained debatable. We aimed to investigate whether ultra-early aneurysm treatment is associated with better neurological outcome in all patients or only good-grade patients or only poor-grade patients. Methods: Two-hundred and seventy-six (84%) patients had hemorrhage onset time and aneurysm treatment time available for analysis. Values of P < 0.05 were taken as statistically significant, and P values between 0.05 and 0.10 were considered to be a trend. Results: For the 96 poor-grade (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grading scale 4 to 5) patients, there was a significant association between Short Form-36 mental scores and ultra-early aneurysm treatment (50 ± 10 vs. 46 ± 10, P = 0.019) and a trend toward association between ultra-early surgery and favorable neurological outcome (odds ratio 2.4 [95% confidence interval 1.0 to 6.0], P = 0.062). A reduction in clinical rebleeding (12% vs. 22%, P = 0.168) was observed in patients undergoing ultra-early aneurysm treatment. Conclusions: Aneurysm treatment performed within the 24-hour window may be associated with a better outcome and halve the clinical rebleeding risk in poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

0036784446	A phase I-II study of sequential administration of topotecan and oral etoposide (toposiomerase I and II inhibitors) in the treatment of patients with small cell lung carcinoma	BACKGROUND. Topotecan (9-dimethylaminomethyl-10-hydroxycampthothecin) is a new topoisomerase I inhibitor with promising efficacy in the treatment of patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Combination with a topoisomerase II inhibitor may potentate the therapeutic effect of topotecan, although there has been conflicting preclinical information on the combination. The objectives of this study were to establish the maximum tolerated dose and to determine the efficacy of the sequential combination of intravenous topotecan and oral etoposide in the treatment of patients with SCLC. METHODS. Patients with histologically confirmed, limited or extensive stage SCLC were eligible. The dose escalation scheme of three cohorts (six patients per cohort) started at intravenous topotecan 0.5 mg/m

0037032506	Plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA and residual disease after radiotherapy for undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Background: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA can be detected and quantified in the plasma of patients with EBV-related tumors, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Although NPC at early stages can be cured by radical radiotherapy, there is a high recurrence rate in patients with advanced NPC. The pretreatment level of circulating EBV DNA is a prognostic factor for NPC, but the prognostic value of post-treatment EBV DNA has not been studied. We designed a prospective study in Hong Kong, China, to investigate the value of plasma EBV DNA as a prognostic factor for NPC. Methods: One hundred seventy NPC patients, without metastatic disease at presentation, were treated with a uniform radiotherapy protocol. Circulating EBV DNA was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction before treatment and 6-8 weeks after radiotherapy was completed. Risk ratios (RRs) were determined with a Cox regression model, and associations of various factors with progression-free and overall survival and recurrence rates were determined with a stepwise Cox proportional hazards model. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Ninety-nine percent of patients achieved complete clinical remission. Levels of post-treatment EBV DNA dominated the effect of levels of pretreatment EBV DNA for progression-free survival. The RR for NPC recurrence was 11.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.53 to 25.43) for patients with higher post-treatment EBV DNA and 2.5 (95% CI = 1.14 to 5.70) for patients with higher pretreatment EBV DNA. Higher levels of post-treatment EBV DNA were statistically significantly associated with overall survival (P<.001; RR for NPC recurrence = 8.6, 95% CI = 3.69 to 19.97). The positive and negative predictive values for NPC recurrence for a higher level of post-treatment EBV DNA were 87% (95% CI = 58% to 98%) and 83% (95% CI = 76% to 89%), respectively. Conclusion: Levels of post-treatment plasma EBV DNA in patients with NPC appear to strongly predict progression-free and overall survival and to accurately reflect the post-treatment residual tumor load.

0037086560	Construction of the Chinese University Prognostic Index for hepatocellular carcinoma and comparison with the TNM staging system, the Okuda staging system, and the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program staging system: A study based on 926 patients	BACKGROUND. The current TNM staging system for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) does not include liver function parameters and does not provide a precise prognosis for patients in different risk groups. The objectives of this study were to construct a new prognostic index for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, the Chinese University Prognostic Index (CUPI), and to compare it with existing staging systems in terms of their ability to classify patients into different risk group. METHODS. From 1996 to 1998, 926 ethnic Chinese patients who were diagnosed with HCC (mainly hepatitis B-associated) at a single institution were recruited prospectively into this study. A multivariate analysis on 19 patient characteristics was performed using a Cox regression model to identify independent prognostic factors. Weights were derived from the regression coefficients of various factors to construct the CUPI. Patients were classified according to different staging systems. Survival curves were plotted with the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared by using a log-rank test. RESULTS. Both the TNM staging system and the Okuda staging system had prognostic significance, but the significance was lower for the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) prognostic score among the patients in the study population. The CUPI was constructed by adding the following factors into the TNM staging system: total bilirubin, ascites, alkaline phosphatase, α fetoprotein, and asymptomatic disease on presentation. The new CUPI characterized three risk groups with highly significant differences in survival during the whole period of follow-up (P < 0.00001) and was more discriminant than the other systems. CONCLUSIONS. In the study population of patients with mainly hepatitis B-associated HCC, the CUPI was more discriminant than the TNM staging system, the Okuda staging systems, or the CLIP prognostic score in classifying patients into different risk groups and was better at predicting survival. The CUPI needs to be validated by different cohorts of patients before it can be recommended for general use. © 2002 American Cancer Society.

0037193834	Preoperative versus postoperative radiotherapy in soft-tissue sarcoma of the limbs: A randomised trial	Background: External-beam radiotherapy (delivered either preoperatively or postoperatively) is frequently used in local management of sarcomas in the soft tissue of limbs, but the two approaches differ substantially in their potential toxic effects. We aimed to determine whether the timing of external-beam radiotherapy affected the number of wound healing complications in soft-tissue sarcoma in the limbs of adults. Methods: After stratification by tumour size (≤10 cm or >10 cm), we randomly allocated 94 patients to preoperative radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions) and 96 to postoperative radiotherapy (66 Gy in 33 fractions). The primary endpoint was rate of wound complications within 120 days of surgery. Analyses were per protocol for primary outcomes and by intention to treat for secondary outcomes. Findings: Median follow-up was 3.3 years (range 0.27-5.6). Four patients, all in the preoperative group, did not undergo protocol surgery and were not evaluable for the primary outcome. Of those patients who were eligible and evaluable, wound complications were recorded in 31 (35%) of 88 in the preoperative group and 16 (17%) of 94 in the postoperative group (difference 18% [95% CI 5-30], p=0.01). Tumour size and anatomical site were also significant risk factors in multivariate analysis. Overall survival was slightly better in patients who had preoperative radiotherapy than in those who had postoperative treatment (p=0.0481). Interpretation: Because preoperative radiotherapy is associated with a greater risk of wound complications than postoperative radiotherapy, the choice of regimen for patients with soft-tissue sarcoma should take into account the timing of surgery and radiotherapy, and the size and anatomical site of the tumour.

0037669569	Pretherapy quantitative measurement of circulating Epstein - Barr virus DNA is predictive of posttherapy distant failure in patients with early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma of undifferentiated type	BACKGROUND. Patients with International Union Against Cancer (UICC) Stage I-II nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) appear to have a relatively favorable prognosis and generally are excluded from trials of combined modality treatment. More recently, plasma/serum cell-free Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA has been shown to be measurable in the majority of NPC patients at the time of diagnosis, and appears to have prognostic significance. However, within Stage I-II disease, in which failure events are infrequent, the prognostic impact of the pretreatment EBV DNA level has not been addressed to our knowledge. This issue has management implications because different therapeutic strategies currently are employed for patients with good-risk and those with poor-risk NPC. METHODS. A cohort of 90 patients with UICC Stage I-II NPC (World Health Organization Grade 2/3 histology) had their pretherapy plasma/serum EBV DNA levels determined by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay and correlated with the probability of posttherapy failure. All patients received radiation therapy only, except for three patients who also received concurrent chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier plots of the probability of locoregional failure, distant failure, and cancer-specific survival were compared with reference to clinical stage and EBV DNA levels. RESULTS. With a median follow-up time of 45 months, 12 patients and 7 patients, respectively, had developed locoregional and distant failures, including 2 patients with both local and distant failures. Patients with distant failure had significantly higher pretherapy EBV DNA levels than those without failure (a median of 13,219 copies/mL [interquatile-range, 274,635 copies/mL] vs. a median of 423 copies/mL [interquatile-range, 2753 copies/mL]). The probability of distant failure was significantly higher in patients with high (> 4000 copies/mL plasma) compared with low EBV DNA levels (P = 0.0001, log-rank test) and for Stage IIB disease compared with Stage I and Stage IIA disease combined (P = 0.0149, log-rank test), but was not significantly different between patients with Stage II and those with Stage I disease. The risks of locoregional failure were not significantly different between patients with high and those with low EBV DNA levels, and also was not significantly different between clinical substages. Approximately 35% of patients with Stage IIB disease were in the at-risk group for distant failure, as identified by high EBV DNA levels. CONCLUSIONS. Within a group of patients with UICC Stage I-II NPC, the pretherapy plasma EBV DNA level was found to identify a poor-risk group with a probability of distant failure similar to that of patients with advanced stage disease. This group of patients may warrant management considerations currently applicable only to cases of Stage III-IV disease. The prognostic significance of designating Stage IIB disease as per the 1997 UICC staging was confirmed, although the pretherapy EBV DNA level appears to be a more powerful prognostic discriminator in patients with early-stage NPC. © 2003 American Cancer Society.

84869107449	Modeling the impact of air, sea, and land travel restrictions supplemented by other interventions on the emergence of a new influenza pandemic virus	Background: During the early stages of a new influenza pandemic, travel restriction is an immediate and non-pharmaceutical means of retarding incidence growth. It extends the time frame of effective mitigation, especially when the characteristics of the emerging virus are unknown. In the present study, we used the 2009 influenza A pandemic as a case study to evaluate the impact of regulating air, sea, and land transport. Other government strategies, namely, antivirals and hospitalizations, were also evaluated.Methods: Hong Kong arrivals from 44 countries via air, sea, and land transports were imported into a discrete stochastic Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Recovered (SEIR) host-flow model. The model allowed a number of latent and infectious cases to pass the border, which constitutes a source of local disease transmission. We also modeled antiviral and hospitalization prevention strategies to compare the effectiveness of these control measures. Baseline reproduction rate was estimated from routine surveillance data. Results: Regarding air travel, the main route connected to the influenza source area should be targeted for travel restrictions; imposing a 99% air travel restriction delayed the epidemic peak by up to two weeks. Once the pandemic was established in China, the strong land connection between Hong Kong and China rendered Hong Kong vulnerable. Antivirals and hospitalization were found to be more effective on attack rate reductions than travel restrictions. Combined strategies (with 99% restriction on all transport modes) deferred the peak for long enough to establish a vaccination program. Conclusion: The findings will assist policy-makers with decisions on handling similar future pandemics. We also suggest regulating the extent of restriction and the transport mode, once restriction has been deemed necessary for pandemic control. Although travel restrictions have yet to gain social acceptance, they allow time for mitigation response when a new and highly intrusive virus emerges. © 2012 Chong and Zee; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84873845343	Cross Sectional Survey of Influenza Antibodies before and during the 2009 Pandemic in Shenzhen, China	Much information is available for the 2009 H1N1 influenza immunity response, but little is known about the antibody change in seasonal influenza before and during the novel influenza A pandemic. In this study, we conducted a cross-sectional serological survey of 4 types of major seasonal influenza in March and September 2009 on a full range of age groups, to investigate seasonal influenza immunity response before and during the outbreak of the sH1N1 influenza in Shenzhen - the largest migration city in China. We found that the 0-5 age group had an increased antibody level for all types of seasonal influenza during the pandemic compared to the pre-outbreak level, in contrast with almost all other age groups, in which the antibody level decreased. Also, distinct from the antibodies of A/H3N2, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria that decreased significantly during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the antibody of A/H1N1 showed no statistical difference from the pre-outbreak level. The results suggest that the antibodies against the 2009 sH1N1 cross-reacted with seasonal H1N1. Moreover, the 0-5 age group was under attack by both seasonal and 2009 H1N1 influenza during the pandemic, hence vaccination merely against a new strain of flu might not be enough to protect the youngest group. © 2013 Wu et al.

84886230213	Cardiovascular disease risk reduction in rural China: A clustered randomized controlled trial in Zhejiang	Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death in China. Despite government efforts, the majority of hypertensive and diabetic patients in China do not receive proper treatment. Reducing CVD events requires long-term care that is proactive, patient-centred, community-based, and sustainable. We have designed a package of interventions for patients at high risk of CVD to be implemented by family doctors based in township hospitals (providers of primary care) in rural Zhejiang, China. This trial aims to determine whether the systematic CVD risk reduction package results in reduced CVD events among patients at risk of CVD compared with usual care, and whether the package is cost-effective and suitable for routine implementation and scale-up.Methods/Design: This is a prospective, open-label, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with blinded data analysis. The trial will randomize 67 township hospitals with 31,708 participants in three counties in Zhejiang Province. Participants will be identified from existing health records and will comprise adults aged 50 to 74 years, with a calculated 10-year CVD risk of 20% or higher, or diabetes. In the intervention arm, participants will receive a package of interventions including: 1) healthy lifestyle counseling (smoking cessation, and salt, oil, and alcohol reduction); 2) prescription of a combination of drugs (antihypertensives, aspirin, and statin); and 3) adherence support for drug compliance and healthy lifestyle change. In the control arm, participants will receive usual care for hypertension and diabetes management at individual clinicians' discretion. The primary outcome is the incidence of severe CVD events over 24 months of follow-up. All CVD events will be defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) monitoring of trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease (MONICA) definitions, diagnosed at the county hospital or higher level, and reported by the Zhejiang surveillance system. Secondary outcomes include: mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, serum total cholesterol (TC), and adherence to appointments, and drugs and lifestyle changes.Discussion: This trial focuses on risk reduction of CVD rather than specific diseases. It is not designed to compare therapeutic and healthy lifestyle interventions, but rather their combined effects in primary care settings. Through the trial, we intend to understand the effectiveness of the comprehensive CVD reduction package in routine practice. We also intend to understand the barriers and facilitators to implementing the package, and thus to advise on policy and practice change.Trial registration: Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN58988083. © 2013 Wei et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0042334787	Disparity of sensitivities in detection of radiation-naïve and postirradiation recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma of the undifferentiated type by quantitative analysis of circulating Epstein-Barr virus DNA	Purpose: The purpose of this research was to compare the sensitivities of plasma EBV DNA in detection of postirradiation locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), postirradiation distant metastatic NPC, and radiation-naïve NPC. Experimental Design: Twenty-four patients with postirradiation local recurrence of NPC were assessed for plasma EBV DNA levels by a real-time quantitative PCR system. The results were compared with those of a cohort of 140 patients with newly diagnosed NPC and with those of 25 patients with distant metastatic relapse. EBV-encoded RNA positivity was also assessed in locally recurrent tumors and newly diagnosed tumors with undetectable plasma EBV DNA levels. Results: Postirradiation locally recurrent tumors were associated with a significantly lower rate of detectable plasma EBV DNA compared with radiation-naïve tumors of comparable stage [stage I-II tumors: 5 of 12 (42%) versus 47 of 51 (92%), P = 0.0002; stage III-IV tumors: 10 of 12 (83%) versus 88 of 89 (99%), P = 0.01; Fisher's exact test], and compared with distant metastatic recurrences [15 of 24 (63%) versus 24 of 25 (96%), P < 0.02; Fisher's exact test]. The median EBV DNA level in patients with detectable EBV DNA was also significantly lower in locally recurrent tumors than in radiation-naïve tumors. All of the tissue samples of tumors associated with undetectable EBV DNA levels, where available, were EBV-encoded RNA positive. Conclusions: The sensitivity of EBV DNA in the detection of tumors regrowing from an irradiated site is much lower than that from a radiation-naïve site. Although plasma EBV DNA is very effective in detecting distant metastatic relapse of NPC, it cannot be relied on as the sole surveillance tool for detection of local relapse.

0343920688	Intracavitary brachytherapy significantly enhances local control of early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma: The existence of a dose-tumor-control relationship above conventional tumoricidal dose	Purpose: To study the efficacy of intracavitary brachytherapy (ICT) in early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods and Materials: All T1 and T2 (nasal infiltration) NPC treated with a curative intent from 1984 to 1996 were analyzed (n = 509). One hundred sixty-three patients were given ICT after radical external radiotherapy (ERT) (Group A). They were compared with 346 patients treated by ERT alone (Group B). The ERT delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected BED-10 ≥75 Gy) to the primary tumor and did not differ between the two groups in technique or dosage. The ICT delivered a dose of 18-24 Gy in 3 fractions over 15 days to a point 1 cm perpendicular to the midpoint of the plane of the sources. ICT was used to treat local persistence diagnosed at 4-6 weeks after ERT (n = 101) or as an adjuvant for the complete responders to ERT (n = 62). Results: The two groups did not differ in patients' age or sex, rate of distant metastasis, rate of regional failure, overall survival, or the follow-up duration. However, Group A had significantly more T2 lesions and Group B had significantly more advanced N- stages. Local failure was significantly less (crude rates 6.75% vs. 13.0%; 5- year actuarial rates 5.40% vs. 10.3%) and the disease-specific mortality was significantly lower (crude rates 14.1% vs. 21.7%; 5-year actuarial rates 11.9% vs. 16.4%) in Group A compared to Group B. Multivariate analysis showed that the ICT was the only significant prognostic factor predictive for fewer local failures (Cox regression p = 0.0328, risk ratio = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.256-0.957). However, when ICT was excluded from the Cox regression model, the total physical dose or the total BED-10 uncorrected for tumor repopulation during the period of radiotherapy became significant in predicting ultimate local failure rate. The two groups were comparable in the incidence rates of each individual chronic radiation complication and the actuarial cumulative rate of the chronic radiation complications, with the exception of chronic radiation nasopharyngeal ulceration/necrosis which occurred in 10 patients in Group A and 1 patient in Group B. Headache (n = 4) and foul smell (n = 8) consequential to ulceration/necrosis were mild and manageable by conservative means. A significant dose-tumor-control relationship existed when local failure was studied as a function of the total physical dose or the total biological equivalent dose (linear quadratic equation, α/β = 10) uncorrected for tumor repopulation during the time course of the radiotherapy. Conclusions: Supplementing ERT which delivered tumoricidal dose (uncorrected BED-10 ≥75 Gy), ICT significantly enhanced ultimate local control and avoided the necessity for morbid salvage treatments in early T-stage (T1/T2 nasal infiltration) NPC. The slight increase in chronic radiation ulceration/necrosis after ICT was acceptable with mild and manageable symptoms. Other late complications were not increased. A significant dose-tumor-control relationship exists above the conventional tumoricidal dose level. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

84892381819	Changes in pulmonary tuberculosis prevalence: Evidence from the 2010 population survey in a populous province of China	Background: This paper reports findings from the prevalence survey conducted in Shandong China in 2010, a province with a population of 94 million. This study aimed to estimate TB prevalence of the province in 2010 in comparison with the 2000 survey; and to compare yields of TB cases from different case finding approaches. Methods: A population based, cross-sectional survey was conducted using multi-stage random cluster sampling. 54,279 adults participated in the survey with a response rate of 96%. Doctors interviewed and classified participants as suspected TB cases if they presented with persistent cough, abnormal chest X-ray (CXRAY), or both. Three sputum specimens of all suspected cases were collected and sent for smear microscopy and culture. Results: Adjusted prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases was 34 per 100,000 for adults in Shandong in 2010. Compared to the 2000 survey, TB prevalence has declined by 80%. 53% of bacteriologically confirmed cases did not present persistent cough. The yield of bacteriologically confirmed cases was 47% by symptom screening and 95% by CXRAY. Over 50% of TB cases were among over 65's. Conclusions: The prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases was significantly reduced compared with 2000. The survey raised challenges to identify TB cases without clear symptoms. © 2014 Wei et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84892948782	Detection of neovascularization based on fractal and texture analysis with interaction effects in diabetic retinopathy	Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of blindness. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is a result of severe vascular complication and is visible as neovascularization of the retina. Automatic detection of such new vessels would be useful for the severity grading of diabetic retinopathy, and it is an important part of screening process to identify those who may require immediate treatment for their diabetic retinopathy. We proposed a novel new vessels detection method including statistical texture analysis (STA), high order spectrum analysis (HOS), fractal analysis (FA), and most importantly we have shown that by incorporating their associated interactions the accuracy of new vessels detection can be greatly improved. To assess its performance, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (AUC) are obtained. They are 96.3%, 99.1% and 98.5% (99.3%), respectively. It is found that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of new vessels detection significantly over previous methods. The algorithm can be automated and is valuable to detect relatively severe cases of diabetic retinopathy among diabetes patients. © 2013 Lee et al.

84901218458	Interleukin-27 Is differentially associated with HIV viral load and CD4	Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and the resultant Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic are major global health challenges; hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection has made the HIV/AIDS epidemic even worse. Interleukin-27 (IL-27), a cytokine which inhibits HIV and HCV replication in vitro, associates with HIV infection and HIV/HCV co-infection in clinical settings. However, the impact of HIV and HCV viral loads on plasma IL-27 expression levels has not been well characterized. In this study, 155 antiretroviral therapy-naïve Chinese were recruited. Among them 80 were HIV- and HCV-negative healthy controls, 45 were HIV-mono-infected and 30 were HIV/HCV-co-infected. Plasma level HIV, HCV, IL-27 and CD4+ number were counted and their correlation, regression relationships were explored. We show that: plasma IL-27 level was significantly upregulated in HIV-mono-infected and HIV/HCV-co-infected Chinese; HIV viral load was negatively correlated with IL-27 titer in HIV-mono-infected subjects whereas the relationship was opposite in HIV/HCV-co-infected subjects; and the relationships between HIV viral loads, IL-27 titers and CD4

84901791161	Four pairs of gene-gene interactions associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes (CDKN2BAS-KCNJ11), obesity (SLC2A9-IGF2BP2, FTO-APOA5), and hypertension (MC4R-IGF2BP2) in Chinese women	Metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes, obesity and hypertension have growing prevalence globally every year. Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified many genetic markers associated to these diseases, but few studied their interaction effects. In this study, twenty candidate SNPs from sixteen genes are selected, and a lasso-multiple regression approach is implemented to consider the SNP-SNP interactions among them in an Asian population. It is found out that the main effects of the markers are weak but the interactions among the candidates showed a significant association to diseases. SNPs from genes CDKN2BAS and KCNJ11 are significantly associated to risk for developing diabetes, and SNPs from FTO and APOA5 might interact to play an important role for the onset of hypertension. © 2014 The Authors.

84903515220	Plasma Epstein-Barr viral DNA load at midpoint of radiotherapy course predicts outcome in advanced-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Background: To test the hypothesis that prognostication of treatment outcome is feasible by biomarker response at midcourse of chemoradiotherapy (CRT)/radiotherapy (RT), with respect to the plasma load of Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) DNA in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients and methods: One hundred seven patients with stage IIB-IV NPC were prospectively studied. Plasma EBV DNA load was measured by quantitative PCR before therapy (pre-DNA), at completion of 4 weeks of CRT/RT (mid-DNA), and within 3 months of completion of therapy (post-DNA). The end points are post-DNA load, a recognized surrogate of survival, and clinical outcome. Results: Ninety-three percent of patients had detectable EBV DNA before therapy (median load = 972 copies/ml). EBV DNA became undetectable in 55 (51%) patients at the end of week 4 of therapy. Detectable mid-DNA was associated with worse clinical outcome (median follow-up time, 6.2 years), for distant failure [hazard ratio (HR) 12.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.78-51.93; P < 0.0001], progression-free survival (PFS; HR 4.05, 95% CI 1.89-8.67, P < 0.0001), and overall survival (OS; HR 3.29, 95% CI 1.37-7.90, P = 0.0077). Seventy-four percent of all failures were associated with detectable mid-DNA, whereas 34% of all failures were associated with detectable post-DNA. Stratification by tumor stage (IIB, III, IV) has no significant prognostic effect. Conclusions: Unfavorable EBV DNA response at midcourse of RT/CRT is an adverse prognosticator for treatment outcome, is linked to majority of all failures, and discriminates outcome better than tumor stage. The data could provide a basis for trial design that addresses alteration of therapy intensity during the latter phase of CRT, and adjuvant therapy. Validation studies are awaited. © The Author 2014.

10744223489	A prospective study of pre-treatment cell kinetics and clinical outcome in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Background and purpose: To study pre-treatment cell kinetics and their clinical correlations in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Materials and methods: Ninety newly diagnosed NPC patients were studied using in vivo Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and flow cytometric analysis. Immunohistochemical staining for BrdU and Ki 67 was also performed. Results: The median S-phase duration (Ts) was 6.2 h (range 3.5-18.7 h), median flow cytometric labeling index (FCM-LI) was 7.4% (1.3-37.6%), and median potential doubling time (Tpot) was 3.6 days (0.5-19.9 days). The median histologic labeling index (H-LI) was 12.4% (1.2-43.3%), and median histologic Tpot (H-Tpot) was 2.1 days (0.5-33.3 days). FCM-LI and H-LI were both positively correlated with Ki67 whereas Tpot and H-Tpot were both negatively correlated with Ki67 and N-stage. In univariate analysis, Tpot and H-Tpot showed a trend for progression free survival. Tpot was significantly associated with local relapse free survival, but lost its significance in multivariate analysis. N-stage was the only significant prognostic factor for all radiotherapy outcomes in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Conclusions: Tpot was the only pre-treatment cell kinetic parameter for which some evidence was found for an association with survival in NPC patients. Future studies should aim to combine cell kinetic parameters together with other biological markers and clinical parameters to provide more useful prognostic information to guide individual patient's therapy. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

10744230953	Prognostic significance of tumor angiogenesis, Ki 67, p53 oncoprotein, epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2 receptor protein expression in undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma - A prospective study	Background. This study prospectively examines the prognostic role of p53 oncoprotein (p53), Ki67-antigen (Ki67), tumor angiogenesis (MVD), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and HER2 receptor protein (HER2) expression in Chinese with undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods. Seventy-eight Chinese were recruited from October 1995 to July 1997 at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. Pretreatment immunohistochemical preparations of the primary tumor were made, and clinical data were collected prospectively until October 30, 2000. The markers were correlated with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), time to progression (TTP), and UICC stage. Results. On univariate analysis, EGFR expression correlated with poorer OS (p = .0001), DFS (p = .01), shorter TTP (p = .0001), and advanced T stage (p = .036). Strong EGFR expression, when compared with weak or moderate, was associated with poorer OS (p = .04) and shorter TTP in a subgroup of patients with UICC stage III-IV disease. HER2 expression was associated with advanced UICC stage (p = .006). The presence of p53 expression correlated with poorer DFS (p = .01) and a trend toward shorter TTP (p = .06). No correlation was found with Ki67-antigen or MVD. On multivariate analysis, only EGFR expression was significantly linked to shorter OS and TTP. Conclusions. EGFR expression in undifferentiated NPC is associated with a poor clinical outcome. A prognostic role of p53 and HER2 expression is suggestive but not consistently defined in this study. The relatively high prevalence of positive staining for EGFR supports the use of molecular targeted therapy in this disease. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

0742287012	Improved Accuracy of Detection of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma by Combined Application of Circulating Epstein-Barr Virus DNA and Anti-Epstein-Barr Viral Capsid Antigen IgA Antibody	Background: Circulating Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) DNA and anti-EBV capsid antigen IgA (IgA VCA) represent two of the most sensitive peripheral blood markers of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but direct comparative studies of these two markers are lacking. Methods: The sensitivities and specificities of IgA-VCA and EBV DNA for diagnosis of NPC were determined in 139 new cases of NPC and 178 healthy individuals, respectively. EBV DNA was also assessed in 36 healthy family members identified as having false-positive IgA-VCA results at a screening clinic. EBV DNA was measured by a real-time quantitative PCR assay with a detection limit of 60 copies/mL. IgA-VCA was measured by semiquantitative indirect immunofluorescent method; a titer ≥1/10 was taken as positive. Results: The sensitivities of EBV DNA and IgA-VCA for diagnosis of NPC were 95% (95% confidence interval, 91-98%) and 81% (73-87%), respectively. The combined marker panel had an overall sensitivity (positive result by either marker) of 99%. The concentrations of both markers showed dependence on cancer stage. The specificities of EBV DNA and IgA-VCA were 98% (96-99%) and 96% (91-98%), respectively. Among 36 healthy family members with false-positive IgA-VCA results, three-fourths had undetectable EBV DNA, whereas the others had increased EBV DNA concentrations that were significantly lower than in NPC patients. Conclusions: For diagnosis of NPC, EBV DNA identifies almost all false-negative IgA-VCA cases and gives a 99% diagnostic sensitivity when combined with IgA-VCA. In the screening setting, EBV DNA identifies three-fourths of false-positive IgA-VCA cases. The selective application of EBV DNA in an IgA-VCA-based screening protocol could improve screening accuracy with only moderate increases in cost. © 2004 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

10044257645	Treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with intensity-modulated radiotherapy: The Hong Kong experience	Purpose To evaluate the efficacy of using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in the primary treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), including the role of dose escalation above 66 Gy level. Methods and materials Between July 2000 and September 2002, 63 newly diagnosed NPC patients were treated with IMRT. The disease was Stage I in 9 (14%), Stage II in 18 (29%), Stage III in 22 (35%), and Stage IV in 14 (22%). The prescribed dose was 66 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and positive neck nodes, 60 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV), and 54-60 Gy to the clinically negative neck. All 20 (100%) patients with T1-2a tumors received intracavitary brachytherapy (ICB) boost, and 15/42 (36%) patients with T2b-T4 tumors received conformal boost (8 Gy/4 fractions). Nineteen patients with advanced stage disease also received either neoadjuvant or concurrent chemotherapy. Acute and late normal tissue effects were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Local relapse-free survival (LRFS), nodal relapse-free survival (NRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results With a median follow-up of 29 months (range 8-45 months), 4 patients developed local in-field failure, 1 patient developed regional relapse, and 13 patients developed distant metastases. All 4 patients with local failure had either T3 or T4 disease before primary treatment and did not have ICB or conformal boost. The 3-year actuarial LRFS, NRFS, DMFS, and OS were 92%, 98%, 79%, and 90%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that dose escalation above 66 Gy was significantly associated with better PFS and DMFS, whereas GTV size was a significant adverse factor for OS. The worst acute mucositis was Grade 1 or 2 in 36 (59%), and Grade 3 in 25 (41%) patients. Acute dysphagia requiring tube feeding occurred in 5 (8%) patients. The proportion of patients with Grade 2-3 xerostomia was 57% at 3 months, and 23% at 2 years after IMRT. Within the subset of patients with a mean parotid dose of <31 Gy, the proportions with Grade 2-3 xerostomia were 30% and 17% at 3 months and 2 years, respectively. Conclusion Our experience of using IMRT in the primary treatment of NPC showed a very high rate of locoregional control and favorable toxicity profile. Furthermore, we found that dose escalation above 66 Gy of IMRT-based therapy was a significant determinant of progression-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival for advanced T-stage tumors. Distant metastases represent the predominant mode of treatment failure. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

13444291023	Knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes of Hong Kong Chinese women on screening mammography and early breast cancer management	In most Western countries, screening mammography and breast-conserving therapy (BCT) are now well-established practices and have been well accepted by women over the last two decades. There are limited data on the acceptability of these strategies by Chinese women in an Oriental society where a population-based screening program has not been established and mastectomy is still commonly practiced. A survey was conducted of 1012 Hong Kong Chinese women, ages 18-69 years, to assess the level of knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes on screening mammography and the surgical management of early breast cancer. Most women (58%) had never heard of mammographic screening, and housewives were more likely to have heard of it than nonhousewives (49% versus 37%; p = 0.0001). The majority (82%) of those who had heard of mammographic screening believe that it can detect early breast cancers and reduce mortality, however, only 58% of these women would participate in yearly screening and clinical breast examination despite acknowledging the potential benefits; a lack of time and the cost were the predominant reasons given. Forty-seven percent of women had the misconception that mastectomy was the only curative treatment; when the alternative was explained, the overall rate for choosing BCT rose from 29% to 49%. There was no correlation between age and the choice of surgery. Most women (75%) felt that breast reconstruction after mastectomy was desirable and acceptable. A lack of knowledge on mammographic screening is prevalent and the concept of preventive health care has a low priority in this Chinese population. Mastectomy is still widely perceived as the only curative treatment; BCT with cosmetic reconstruction is seen as an acceptable alternative. Interventions to improve the accuracy of information and to encourage preventive health care behaviors will have a positive impact on establishing cancer screening programs and providing quality cancer care in the future.

12344325624	Analysis and interpretation of health-related quality-of-life data from clinical trials: Basic approach of the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group	Clinicians are being confronted with increasing amounts of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) data. Thus, there is a need for a greater understanding of the analysis and interpretation of HRQOL so that the data can be reported in an appropriate manner. The approach of the Clinical Trials Group of the National Cancer Institute of Canada emphasises the clinical meaning of the results, while avoiding complex statistical modelling. It consists of four steps: calculating the questionnaire completion rates, calculating the baseline scores, determining the individual change in scores over time for the domains specified in the trial hypothesis, and culminates in determining the proportions of patients who have reported clinically meaningful changes in scores since baseline. A rationale supporting each step is given. This approach is presented as a simple and practical aid to the analysis, interpretation and reporting of HRQOL results. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

1242269922	High hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA viral load is an important risk factor for HBV reactivation in breast cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation during cytotoxic chemotherapy for cancer may complicate treatment and cause liver damage. The complication has been reported to occur in 10% to over 50% of HBV carriers, but the factors that determine which patients will develop reactivation remain unclear. The objective of the study is to test the hypothesis that the prechemotherapy HBV DNA level is a risk factor for the development of HBV reactivation. We studied 41 women undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy for breast cancer, 17 of whom developed reactivation and 24 who did not. We developed a novel, ultra-sensitive, real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for the measurement of HBV DNA. The sera of 37 patients (16 who developed reactivation and 21 who did not) were available for measurement of HBV DNA using this technique. The results showed that patients in the reactivation group had a significantly higher median HBV DNA load (1.03 × 10
