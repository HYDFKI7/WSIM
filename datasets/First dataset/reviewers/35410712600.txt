84934990530	Rotating Turbulent Flow Simulation with les and Vreman Subgrid-Scale Models in Complex Geometries	The large eddy simulation (LES) method based on Vreman subgrid-scale model and SIMPIEC algorithm were applied to accurately capture the flowing character in Francis turbine passage under the small opening condition. The methodology proposed is effective to understand the flow structure well. It overcomes the limitation of eddy-viscosity model which is excessive, dissipative. Distributions of pressure, velocity, and vorticity as well as some special flow structure in guide vane near-wall zones and blade passage were gained. The results show that the tangential velocity component of fluid has absolute superiority under small opening condition. This situation aggravates the impact between the wake vortices that shed from guide vanes. The critical influence on the balance of unit by spiral vortex in blade passage and the nonuniform flow around guide vane, combined with the transmitting of stress wave, has been confirmed.

34347354468	Study on turbulence features near an oscillating curved wall	In pursuit of possibly true turbulent characters and for exploring a change in turbulence structures near an oscillating flexible wall-curved surface, a sinusoidal oscillation mode was forced to a curved wall, whose vibrations disturbed the flow with an interacting effort between the fluid and the structure. The methodology used was the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with fluid-structure interaction. The oscillating configuration was on a Fourier sinusoidal mode from the measurements of a Francis hydro turbine blade vibration. The effects of the vibration on the skin friction coefficient, vortices, turbulent coherent structures, and other statistical quantities were studied. The results showed that the streamwise velocity gradient along the normal direction and the normal velocity gradient along the spanwise direction were considerably increased within the viscous sublayer because of the oscillating wall, which additionally caused the low speed streaks to stay away from the wall and the high-momentum flows to be toward the wall. As a result, the streamwise vortices were much more elongated along the downstream to get an energy balance, and the wall skin friction coefficient or the wall friction velocity rose up. © 2007 Publishing House for Journal of Hydrodynamics.

34548503400	Analysis of flow-induced vibration of blades for a Francis hydro turbine	A fully coupled modeling and numerical simulation of flow-induced vibration of three-dimensional blades for a Francis hydro turbine in unsteady turbulent flow are presented. The methodology used is of the generalized variational principle on a power functional of the fluid-blade system. Three vibrating mechanisms of the blades, turbulent-induced vibration, vortex-induced vibration and fluid elasticity instability, are involved in the establishments with fluid-structure interaction (FSI). A working model turbine was designed and used to implement comparisons with experimental measurements. On the pressure and suction sides of one blade of this turbine, ten Kulite's pressure transducers are mounted, and three acceleration transducers are rigged on other blade. An iterative scheme for the fluid and for the blade is implemented in turn. For the phase of the flow and for the phase of the vibration, large eddy simulation (LES) and step-by-step integral method are employed, respectively. The comparison shows that the computational results are agreeable with the experimental measurements.

34248662951	Large-eddy simulation of turbulent flow considering inflow wakes in a Francis turbine blade passage* * Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 50579025 and 90210005).	Turbulent flow in a 3-D blade passage of a Francis hydro turbine was simulated with the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to investigate the spatial and temporal distributions of the turbulence when strongly distorted wakes in the inflow sweep over the passage. In a suitable consideration of the energy exchanging mechanism between the large and small scales in the complicated passage with a strong 3-D curvature, one-coefficient dynamic Sub-Grid-Scale (SGS) stress model was used in this article. The simulations show that the strong wakes in the inflow lead to a flow separation at the leading zone of the passage, and to form a primary vortex in the span-wise direction. The primary span-wise vortex evolves and splits into smaller vortex pairs due to the constraint of no-slip wall condition, which triggers losing stability of the flow in the passage. The computed pressures on the pressure and suction sides agree with the measured data for a working test turbine model. © 2007 Publishing House for Journal of Hydrodynamics.

84877139710	Investigation into leakage characteristics of honeycomb seals for water	A honeycomb seal installed between two parallel flat plates was used as an analytical model; the three-dimensional flow in the seal was solved numerically according to the Navier-Stokes equations and Vreman subgrid stress model to investigate the leakage characteristics and sealing mechanism in honeycomb seals for water. The finite volume method was used to discretize the Navier-Stokes equations and the second-order upwind scheme and the second-order central scheme are applied to the convection and diffusion terms in the equations, respectively. The leakage flow rates through the honeycomb with different sizes of cells were obtained by means of numerical computation and compared with those in a corresponding labyrinth seal; eventually, the leakage characteristics and sealing mechanism were discussed. The results show that the honeycomb seal has better sealing performance than the labyrinth seal, a honeycomb with cells of 6 mm radius and 4 mm depth achieves the lowest leakage flow rate, causing the best sealing effect. Also, the leakage flow rate increases approximately linearly with increasing pressure difference across the inlet and outlet of the seal; however, the leakage flow rate remains nearly constant when the plate moving speed varies. Through further exploring the flow pattern in the honeycomb seal, it was observed that strong vortices have been generated in the honeycomb cell and consume the kinetic energy of stream. Such a flow pattern is mainly responsible for pressure drop and throttling effect in the seal.

Galerkin and harmonic balance method are used to analyze the relation between the amplitudes and the frequencies of the tubes. The results show that the critical initial stress plays a significant control role in the amplitude-frequency curves. When the initial axial stress is less than the critical initial stress, DWCNTs have twice dynamical mode transitions corresponding to twice noncoaxial vibrations, however, when the initial axial stress is larger than the critical initial stress, the topological forms of the amplitude-frequency curve are changeable, which are corresponding to coaxial vibration or three possible noncoaxial vibration type. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

55949137917	LES of turbulent flow in a vibrating curved-wall channel	To well understand the mechanism of energy dissipation in a turbine flow passage and explore the change of turbulence structures, a spatio-temporal sinusoidal oscillatory mode is numerically tested in a turbulent curved-channel flow using large eddy simulation (LES). Six computing cases incorporated with different vibrating parameters of the wall are dealt with, and the distributions of the pressure, vortices, and other turbulent statistical quantities in the near wall regions are studied. The results show that the turbulence intensities increase largely in near wall regions, suggesting that the viscous sublayer is thinner as a result of the velocity graduate's rise due to the spanwise wall oscillation. Furthermore, the energy dissipation is increasing. The present study also shows that the mechanism of energy dissipation by spanwise-wall oscillation is strongly related to the spanwise-vortex generated at the edge of the viscous sublayer by the periodic Couette flow layer.

Based on the nonlocal elasticity theory which allows the effects of small length scale and the more refined van der Waals (vdW) interaction formulas, the equation of motion is first derived and then solved analytically. The results reveal that the effects of the small length scale are significant for small aspect ratios and high radial vibration modes, and are instead insensitive to the number of layers of MWCNTs and weakly dependent on the wall thickness of MWNTs. This finding means that the effects of small length scale on complicated MWCNTs may be simplified to double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) or even single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.

65249089221	Large eddy simulation of the turbulent flow field in guide vane flow passages of a mixed-flow type water turbine	By using the N - S control equation of a nonsteady uncompressible fluid and the dynamic sub-grid turbulence model of a large eddy simulation, and based on mixed grid techniques, the authors have employed SIMPLEC algorithm to seek separate solutions to velocity and pressure variables. As a result, obtained were the distribution of velocity field, pressure field and vorticity field in the whole flow passages of the movable guide vanes of an A55x type test-model water turbine. The calculation results show that the eddy belt formed by the stream encircling the movable guide vanes further develops downstream, leading to a nonuniform velocity and pressure distribution at the inlet of the rotating wheel and exercising a direct influence on the flow state inside the wheel. In the meanwhile, studied were the dynamic characteristics of the nonuniform flow field after the guide vanes. It has been found that the closer to the downstream, the smaller the time-averaged pressure and speed nonuniformity. However, the values of transient nonuniformity at various cross sections have a relatively big difference. It is proposed that to identify the cross section, which always has the minimum time-averaged speed nonuniformity after the blades, should become an important design effort and index for the hydraulic design of future water turbines.

67649933725	Strongly coupled simulation of fluid-structure interaction in a Francis hydroturbine	This work simulates a complex fluid flow in fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The flow under consideration is governed by Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible viscous fluids and modeled with the finite volume method. Large eddy simulation is used to simulate the unsteady turbulent flow. The structure is represented by a finite element formulation. The present work introduces a strongly coupled partitioned approach that is applied to complex flow in fluid machinery. In this approach, the fluid and structure equations are solved separately using different solvers, but are implicitly coupled into one single module based on sensitivity analysis of the important displacement and stress modes. The applied modes and their responses are used to build up a reduced-order model. The proposed model is used to predict the unsteady flow fields of a 3D complete passage, involving in stay, guide vanes, and runner blades, for a Francis hydro turbine and FSI is considered. The computational results show that a fairly good convergence solution is achieved by using the reduced-order model that is based on only a few displacement and stress modes, which largely reduces the computational cost, compared with traditional approaches. At the same time, a comparison of the numerical results of the model with available experimental data validates the methodology and assesses its accuracy. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The Galerkin method and harmonic balance method are used to study the issue. The results obtained show that the radial vibrational modes of simply supported DWCNTs have twice the dynamical mode transitions as the frequency increases. The transitions correspond to twice the noncoaxial vibrations which play a critical role in electronic and transport properties of CNTs. Moreover, comparisons of the dynamical behaviors of fluid-filled DWCNTs with different wave numbers, radii and aspect ratios demonstrate that the amplitudefrequency curve topological forms are identical. Meanwhile, it is also concluded that the existence of fluid is significant for the value of amplitude ratio corresponding to noncoaxial vibration whereas it does not change the nonlinear vibrating topological pattern of amplitude-frequency curves. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.

Based on simplified Donnell's cylindrical shell model and potential flow theory, the effect of internal fluid on the coupling vibration of the MWCNTs-fluid system is discussed in detail. The results show that the resonant frequencies are decreased due to the effect of the fluid, and the fluid has only a little influence on the associated amplitude ratio in MWCNTs corresponding to the natural resonant frequency (frequency of the innermost tube), while plays a significant role in the associated amplitude ratios corresponding to the intertube resonant frequency. For the natural resonant frequency, the vibration mode is coaxial. However, for the intertube resonant frequency, the system shows complex noncoaxial vibration, which plays a critical role in electronic and transport properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

74849111208	FEM simulation of turbulent flow in a turbine blade passage with dynamical fluid-structure interaction	Results are described from a combined mathematical modeling and numerical iteration schemes of flow and vibration. We consider the coupling numerical simulations of both turbulent flow and structure vibration induced by flow. The methodology used is based on the stabilized finite element formulations with time integration. A fully coupled model of flow and flow-induced structure vibration was established using a hydride generalized variational principle of fluid and solid dynamics. The spatial discretization of this coupling model is based on the finite element interpolating formulations for the fluid and solid structure, while the different time integration schemes are respectively used for fluid and solid structure to obtain a stabilized algorithm. For fluid and solid dynamics, Hughes' predictor multi-corrector algorithm and the Newmark method are monolithically used to realize a monolithic solution of the fully coupled model. The numerical convergence is ensured for small deformation vibrating problems of the structure by using different time steps for fluid and solid, respectively. The established model and the associated numerical methodology developed in the paper were then applied to simulate two different flows. The first one is the lid-driven square cavity flow with different Reynolds numbers of 1000, 400 and 100 and the second is the turbulent flows in a 3-D turbine blade passage with dynamical fluid-structure interaction. Good agreement between numerical simulations and measurements of pressure and vibration acceleration indicates that the finite element method formulations developed in this paper are appropriate to deal with the flow under investigation.

77952951659	Nonlocal effect on axially compressed buckling of triple-walled carbon nanotubes under temperature field	This paper studies the small scale effect on the buckling behaviors of triple-walled carbon nanotubes (TWCNTs) with the initial axial stress under the temperature field. The TWCNTs are modeled as three elastic shells coupled together through vdW interaction between different layers. Buckling governing equations of CNTs are firstly formulated on the basis of nonlocal elastic theory and the small scale effect on CNTs buckling results with the change of temperature are then achieved. The results show that the critical buckling load is dependent on the temperature, scale parameter and wavenumber. Some conclusions are drawn that small scale effect will arise gradually with the increases of wavenumber, and the temperature can influence the ratio between the nonlocal buckling load and the corresponding local load. Furthermore, with or without effects of nonlocal considered, the same results is obtained that the axial buckling load increases as the value of temperature increases at low and room temperature condition, while at high temperature condition the axial buckling load decreases as the value of temperature increases. © 2010.

77954028489	Strongly coupling of partitioned fluid-solid interaction solvers using reduced-order models	In this work a powerful technique is described which allows the implicit coupling of partitioned solvers in fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. The flow under consideration is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible viscous fluids and modeled with the finite volume method. The structure is represented by a finite element formulation. The method allows the use of a black box fluid and structural solver because it builds up a reduced order model of the fluid and structural problem during the coupling process. Each solution of the fluid/structural solver in the coupling process can be seen as a sensitivity response of an applied displacement/pressure mode. The applied modes and their responses are used to build up a reduced-order model. The proposed model is used to predict the unsteady flow fields of a particular flow-induced vibrational phenomenon - a fixed cubic rigid body is submerged in an incompressible fluid flow (water), an elastic plate is attached to the rigid body in the centre of the downstream face, and the vortices, which separate from the corners of the rigid body upstream, generate lift forces which excite continuous oscillations of the elastic plate downstream. The computational results show that a fairly good convergence solution is achieved by using the reduced-order model that is based on only a few displacement and stress modes, which largely reduces the computational cost, compared with traditional approaches. At the same time, comparison of the numerical results of the model with available experimental data validates the methodology and assesses its accuracy. © 2010.

The main objectives of this research are to know more about the structure of turbulent flows, to identify their three-dimensional characteristic, and to study physical effects due to complex fluid flow. The filtered Navier-Stokes equations are used to simulate large scales; however, they are supplemented by dynamic subgrid-scale (DSGS) models to simulate the energy transfer from large scales toward subgrid-scales, where this energy will be dissipated by molecular viscosity.

The results show that the initial axial stress could crucially affect the existence of the natural and intertube frequencies. Meanwhile, it is also concluded that the temperature change is significant for natural frequency, but weakly affects intertube frequency and amplitude ratios. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84863268497	Fluid-induced vibrations of thin elastic plate for different inflow reynolds numbers	Measurements on vortex-induced elastic thin plate with a 3D-particle image velocimetry (3D-PIV) system and a motion tracking system (DH-5935N) are carried out for understanding the mechanism of the fluid-structure interaction. The flow field near the plate is measured with the 3D-PIV system while the motion of the elastic thin plate is measured with the motion tracking system of the accelerating sensor. In the experiments, macroscopic interprets on the fluid-structure interactions are made using three-dimensional vector fields of the flow and displacements of the elastic plate. Results of motion measures show that the fluid-induced vibration is quite significant for flow Reynolds numbers and the elastic plate shows complex non-periodic and non-symmetry coupled vibrating behavior when the complex wake interacts with the plate, simultaneously, and PIV result shows the interchange of flow patterns with the fluid-induced vibrating plate.

84863272962	Large eddy simulation of turbulent flow downstream of a backward-facing step	large eddy simulation is used to predict turbulent flow in the separated and reattached flow regions downstream of a backward-facing step.Simulations were carried out at a Reynolds number of 28 000 (based on the step height and the upstream centreline velocity) with a channel expansion ratio of 1.25. Two subgrid-scale models were tested, namely the dynamic eddy-viscosity, and the dynamic Vreman model. Both models showed good overall agreement with available experimental data. It is conjectured that the peak in these fluctuations is caused by an impingement mechanism, in which large eddies, originating in the shear layer, impact the wall just upstream of the mean reattachment location. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84863504711	Numerical simulation of blood pulsatile flow in a DeBakey III type of TVD	To discuss the relationship between the development of thoracic aortic dissection (TVD) and hemodynamics, three-dimensional simulation of blood flow in human DeBakey III type of TVD is investigated in normal and hypertension blood pressure using computational fluid dynamics. The pathline distributions on longitudinal section and cross-section of true and false lumens, wall pressure and wall shear stress for the blood flow of the TVD of DeBakey type III are obtained in a cardiac cycle. Numerical results show that the hemodynamic behaviors are closely related to the blood pressure, while the blood pressure has slight influence on the shear stress distribution. The blood pressure in true lumen is also larger than that in false lumen in systole, which suggests that the lumen may expand along the origin lumen.

84865034503	Free vibration of the fluid-filled single-walled carbon nanotube based on a double shell-potential flow model	A double shell-potential flow model is developed to study the free vibration of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) conveying water. Water is divided into the absorbed layer of water molecules and the water flow in the center of the SWCNT. The SWCNT and the internally absorbed layer of water are modelled as two-layer thin shells coupled via the interlayer van der Waals (vdW) interaction. It is shown that the vdW interaction is responsible for an upshift in the frequency of the SWCNT and an improvement of the system stability. Results also reveal that the internal moving water plays an important role in the instability of system whereas it has very little influence on the dynamic characteristics of the SWCNT. It is hoped that the paper can provide a new and efficient approach for the study of the general dynamic behavior of fluid-filled nanodevices. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Distributions of pressure, velocity and vorticity as well as some flow structure in bulk and leakage passage were gained, simultaneously, scale of seal gap influence on the flowing characters in cavity of labyrinth seals and pressure of head cover were explored. The numerical results show that the swirl vortex in blade passage, tip clearance passage and draft tube are largely influence on the balance of runner unit, also, different vortex structure in labyrinth space are generated due to the difference of seal scale, the energy dissipation are quite different which reflect the different seal leakage flux. © 2012 Chin.

84868653982	Effects of sliding mesh interface position on swirling flow fields in impeller machinery	To understand the influence of sliding mesh interface position on swirling flowing fields of impeller machinery, two kinds of typical computational models, namely, with stator and without stator, have been chosen to simulate the situation. The fluid velocity distributions in each impeller machinery model are obtained under different sliding mesh interface positions between rotor and stationary components. The results are compared with some experimental data and that of other literatures. It is shown that: the position of sliding mesh interface is closer to the rotor, the rotating of rotor have little effect on the surrounding fluid flow, while if it is closer to the stationary parts, the rotating of rotor have greater effect on the surrounding fluid flow. It suggests that the position of sliding mesh interface should be 1/8~1/4 close to the rotor of the interval between the rotor and stationary parts.

84891921053	Numerical investigation of interaction between a flexible hyper-elastic structure and fluid using immersed boundary method	Immersed boundary method is one of the important numerical methods for solving the interaction between a flexible elastic structure with large deformation and viscous fluid. The fluid-induced vibration of a cantilever beam attached to a cylinder/square immersed in incompressible fluid is simulated using the hybrid finite difference/finite element immersed boundary method combined with a traditional feedback force method. The immersed boundary method uses hyper-elastic constitutive laws with a finite element discretization of the structure and an adaptive refined Cartesian grid with a finite difference discretization of the fluid. The vibrating characteristics of a flexible hyper-elastic structure and the motion of fluid are obtained. Comparisons between the results of the paper and that of other references show the reliability of this method.

Using finite element immersed boundary method combined with traditional feedback force method, the self-propelled swimming fish is numerically simulated. Firstly, a self-induced vibration of a cantilever beam immersed in a fluid is one of the benchmarks of fluid-structure interaction, which is used to verify the validity of the numerical method. Secondly, start and cruise process of a single swimming fish in a straight-line swimming state is simulated and analysis of the flow characteristics and fish body movement features is done.

84903317305	Numerical investigation of fluid-structure interaction using projected immersed boundary method	A mathematical model describing the interaction between immersed rigid body and fluid was established and was solved using the projection step method similar to the fractional step method for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. The volume ratio of a fluid grid was introduced to consider the effect of immersed rigid body, which was calculated by Romberg algorithm effectively. According to the numerical method, the corresponding numerical calculation program was written by C++ language. The reliability of solving the governing equation of projected immersed boundary method (IBM) was validated by the basic numerical example of flow over a circular cylinder. Finally, the distributions of the velocity field and the pressure field as well as the vortex structures were analyzed in different Reynolds numbers.

84904109604	The environmental effect on the dynamical behaviors of single-walled carbon nanotube in water	The paper investigates the dynamical behaviors of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) in water, focusing on the effect of external environment (i.e., water) on SWCNT. The SWCNT-water system comprises three constituent parts, that is, the SWCNT, the absorbed layer of water molecules, and the water flow around the water layer. The SWCNT and the absorbed layer of water are modeled as two-layer thin shells coupled via the interlayer vdW interaction, and the water surrounding the absorbed water layer is considered as the potential flow. The numerical simulations show that the vdW interaction is responsible for an upshift in the frequency of the SWCNT and preserving the stability of system. Flow velocity has almost no effect on the natural frequency of SWCNT, while being quite significant for destabilizing of the CNT-fluid system. In addition, the effect of wavenumber on the coupled system is also considered. The study not only greatly reduces simulation time but also provides a new model to explain the experimental observation available in particular cases. © 2014 Yan Yan et al.

84905721638	Analysis of flow in side chamber and path of comb-labyrinth seal in Francis turbine at different Reynolds numbers	Since there is a large difference in geometrical scale in the side chamber and comb-labyrinth seal of Francis turbine runner, the fractional step method is used to solve the unsteady, three-dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for the flow in the chamber and tortuous path of the seal. In order to capture vortex structure more exactly, the hexahedral mesh with refinement near the wall boundaries are adopted. The Quick upwind and second-order central difference schemes are selected for convection and diffusion terms, respectively. The velocity and vorticity profiles in the path of labyrinth seal are obtained at different Reynolds numbers; meanwhile the pressure distribution in the side chamber, axial thrust on the runner and torque on the shaft are estimated. It is turned out that a vortex structure can be developed as soon as the fluid enters the path of the labyrinth seal to consume a certain amount of kinetic energy, and a pressure drop is established to prevent the leakage. Note that the vortex structure is largely affected by Reynolds number. The results may be helpful in understan-ding the physical mechanism of complex flow in the path of comb-labyrinth seal and the influence of the seal on rotordynamics of Francis turbine.

84911464182	Numerical investigation of freely self-propelled flexible fish using immersed boundary method	Study on the motion performance of interaction between a swimming or flying creatures and fluid, usually applied to reveal the biological mechanism of mechanics and movement. A “C” type swimming fish as the research object, a flexible model of freely self-propelled swimming fish is established. This model can reflected truly the interaction among fish movement, internal force and the external fluid. Using hybrid finite difference/finite element immersed boundary method combined with traditional feedback force method, the movement of a swimming fish is simulated. The hydrodynamic performance of start-up and cruise process of a swimming fish is analyzed. The results reveal that the conversion of “C” type and “S” type of fish body can improve the efficiency of the fish swimming, and the conversion of “C” type and “S” type is mainly affected by structure of fish body and flow field.

84911484008	Investigation into unsteady flow around tandem cascade of Francis turbine by employing immersed boundary method with feedback force	The immersed boundary method (IBM) is one of important numerical methods for solving the interaction between flexible structure with large deformation or rigid structure and viscous fluid. The advantages of IBM are high computational efficiency, suitable for complicated shape and simple grid structure which means a conformal mesh can be avoided and an adaptive mesh technique can be implemented easily. The original IBM is suitable for the flexible body and was updated with feedback force by Lai and Peskin to approximately deal with a rigid boundary problem. In this paper the unsteady flow around a tandem cascade of Francis turbine is simulated by this updated method. Particularly, the cartesian adaptive mesh refinement and finite difference method are applied in the whole flow field. The unsteady characteristics of the flow field, the non-uniformity indexes for pressure, velocity and vorticity in the guide vane wake are attained. These results are helpful to study on the effects of uneven flow field on fluid-induced blade vibration in a hydro-turbine in future.

84911498075	Dynamic global Vreman model for large eddy simulation of transient turbulent flow in complex geometry	In the method for turbulent numerical simulation, the large eddy simulation (LES) method can provide abundant information for a large vortex, so it has gradually become an important method in the turbulent numerical simulation of the complex geometry and will continue to develop. To construct subgrid stress model as accurately as possible to reflect the physical nature of the flow field characteristics is the most important issue for LES. Based on such a thought, the subgrid-scale (SGS) eddy-viscosity model developed by Vreman is tested in an Re=28000 backward-facing step turbulent flow by comparison to the experimental data. The new LES framework yields excellent agreement for the mean velocity and matches experimental data better than the traditional Smagorinsky-based SGS model. This appears to be the first test of this class of model to flows without any homogeneous flow directions and high Reynold complex turbulent flow. L

Finally, the distributions of streamline and the vortex structures are analyzed in different Reynolds numbers.
