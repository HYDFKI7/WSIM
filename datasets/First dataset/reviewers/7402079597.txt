33746721044	Prevalence and clinical characteristics of glaucoma in adult Chinese: A population-based study in Liwan District, Guangzhou	PURPOSE. To assess the prevalence and mechanism of glaucoma in adults living in an urban area of southern China. METHODS. Random clustering sampling was used to identify adults aged 50 years and over in Liwan District, Guangzhou. Glaucoma was diagnosed with the ISGEO (International Society of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology) classification scheme. All subjects underwent gonioscopy. RESULTS. In the study, 1504 subjects (75.3% participation rate) were examined, with a crude prevalence of all glaucoma of 3.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8%-4.8%). Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) was found in 2.1% (95% CI, 1.4%-2.8%) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) in 1.5% (95% CI, 0.8%-2.1%). The prevalence of all glaucoma was significantly higher in older people and men. CONCLUSIONS. POAG was more common than PACG in this southern Chinese population, with rates similar to those reported in Chinese Singaporeans. The age-adjusted rate of POAG was similar to that found in European-derived populations, but PACG was more common among Chinese, indicating that there is a large burden of glaucoma in the Chinese people.

33847105419	Laser Peripheral Iridotomy in Primary Angle-Closure Suspects: Biometric and Gonioscopic Outcomes. The Liwan Eye Study	Purpose: To assess the immediate effect of laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) and mechanisms of angle closure in a population-based study of primary angle closure (PAC) suspects. Design: Prospective interventional study. Participants: People identified as PAC suspects aged 50 to 79 years from a population-based survey in Guangzhou, China. Intervention: Laser peripheral iridotomy was performed in 1 randomly selected eye. Examinations were carried out before and 2 weeks after the intervention. Main Outcome Measures: Intraocular pressure (IOP), ultrasound biometry, optical pachymetry, and gonioscopy. Results: A total of 72 people with bilateral suspected PAC participated in the study. Mean IOP decreased by 3 mmHg (P<0.001), but axial anterior chamber depth did not change significantly (P = 0.784) after LPI. Median limbal anterior chamber depth increased from 15% to 25% of peripheral corneal thickness (P<0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Median iridotrabecular angle width increased from 0° to 10° in the superior quadrant and from 10° to 30° in the inferior quadrant (P<0.001). Nevertheless, 14 eyes (19.4%) still had 3 or more quadrants in which the posterior (usually pigmented) trabecular meshwork could not be seen after laser iridotomy. Conclusions: This study confirms that LPI results in a significant increase in the angle width in Chinese people with narrow angles. However, one fifth of eyes had residual angle closure after LPI. Although this report confirms that iridotomy widens the anterior chamber angle in most PAC suspects, long-term prospective studies with a larger sample size are required to determine if the risks of PAC glaucoma and other related pathologic sequelae are reduced after prophylactic LPI and to investigate the risk-to-benefit ratio before recommending widespread use of prophylactic LPI in this population. © 2007 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

34247170419	Gonioscopy in adult Chinese: The Liwan eye study	PURPOSE. To assess gonioscopic characteristics of the drainage angle in adult Chinese in an urban area of southern China. METHODS. Clustered random sampling was used to select adults aged 50 years and older in Liwan District, Guangzhou. Gonioscopy was performed on all the subjects. The geometric angle width was graded in the superior and inferior quadrants, according to the Spaeth system. In addition, apparent and true iris insertion was classified in four quadrants with static and dynamic gonioscopy. The peripheral iris profile was described as steep, regular, concave, and plateau. Data are presented for all phakic right eyes. Secondary or iatrogenic cases were excluded in the analysis of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS). RESULTS. Among 1405 participants in the study, data from 1330 (95%) right eyes were available for analysis. Iridotrabecular angles (ITA) ≤20° were present in 36.9% (95% CI: 34.3%-40.0%) of eyes superiorly and in 27.9% (95% CI: 25.5%-30.4%) inferiorly. Narrower ITAs were more common in the older people (sex-adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.1 per year of life; P < 0.001) and the women (age-adjusted OR = 2.5, P < 0.001). Apparent iris insertion of grade A or B (with pigmented trabecular meshwork not visible) by quadrant was observed in 27.2% superiorly, 12.0% nasally, 7.7% inferiorly, and 14.2% temporally. Narrow angles (in which pigmented trabecular meshwork was not visible in three or more quadrants) were identified in 11.0% (95% CI: 9.3%-12.7%) of right eyes. Overall, 33.3% of eyes had a steep iris profile, 54.2% were normal, 2.7% were concave, and 10.1% were graded plateau. PAS were seen in 30 of 146 (20.5%) eyes with narrow angles and in 7 (0.6%) of 1184 eyes with angles that did not meet criteria for narrow angles. PAS were more likely with narrower angles, with 0%, 0.3%, and 1.9% of eyes with a mean ITA of 40°, 30 °, and 20°, respectively, having PAS as opposed to 12.6% and 27.5% for those with ITA 10 ° and 0°, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Ten percent of this population of southern Chinese persons 50 years of age and older had narrow angles. PAS were present in one fifth of these people. From these cross-sectional data, it is unclear which of these individuals are at highest risk of the development of primary angle-closure (PAC) glaucoma. Longitudinal studies are necessary to determine appropriate strategies for preventing this potentially blinding outcome. Copyright © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.

34547151078	Laser Peripheral Iridotomy in Eyes with Narrow Drainage Angles: Ultrasound Biomicroscopy Outcomes. The Liwan Eye Study	Purpose: To assess the short-term effect of laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) on anterior segment anatomy in angle-closure suspects using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). Design: Prospective intervention study. Participants: Persons identified as angle-closure suspects aged 50-79 years from a population-based survey in Guangzhou, China. Intervention: Laser peripheral iridotomy was performed on 1 randomly selected eye. Ultrasound biomicroscopy examination was carried out before and 2 weeks after the intervention. Main Outcome Measures: Proportion of eyes with iridotrabecular contact (ITC), as well as changes in UBM parameters including angle opening distance (AOD), iris thickness (IT), iris curvature, iris ciliary process distance, trabecular-ciliary process distance (TCPD), and scleral spur to iris insertion distance (SS-IR). Results: A total of 72 of 101 eligible subjects participated in the study. The proportion of people with UBM-identified ITC in ≥1 quadrant dropped from 95% (68/72) before to 59% (42/72) after LPI. After LPI, the mean AOD at 250 microns increased from 0.064 mm (standard deviation [SD], 0.052) to 0.085 (0.052) mm (P<0.001); angle recess area increased from 0.040 (0.030) to 0.070 (0.036) mm

37649015492	The epidemiology of age-related eye diseases in Mainland China	While many papers have been published regarding age-related eye diseases in Mainland China in the past two decades, the variable quality of those reports limit the conclusions that can be drawn. Many of these studies assessed blindness and low vision rates, and these estimates are likely accurate. However, due to lack of standardization of techniques for assessing cataract, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy, estimates of the burden of these diseases on the population are less reliable. Owing to the rapid economic development of China in the last decade, resources to address eyecare problems are more likely to be available. Therefore, an accurate assessment of the burden of various eye diseases is needed in order to improve blindness prevention planning and program development.

39549106321	Estimating the rate of progressive visual field damage in those with open-angle glaucoma, from cross-sectional data	PURPOSE. To estimate the rate of visual field progression in open-angle glaucoma (OAG) subjects, by using data from population-based cross-sectional studies. METHODS. Subjects with OAG were identified in nine surveys of randomly sampled populations using standard criteria for glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Subjects were of European, African, Chinese, and Hispanic ethnicity. The measure of OAG damage was the mean deviation (MD) of an automated visual field test (Humphrey Field Analyzer; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA). The rate of progression was the mean of all subjects' damage in the worse eye divided by an average time since onset. Time since onset was estimated from age-specific prevalence rates. RESULTS. A total of 1066 subjects with OAG contributed visual field data. The mean worsening in decibels per year was: European-derived, -1.12; Hispanic, -1.26; African-derived, -1.33; and Chinese -1.56 (difference among ethnicities, P = 0.16). The mean duration of disease was lowest among Chinese persons at 10.5 years (95% CI: 8.8 -12.6) and was highest in African-derived subjects at 15.4 years (95% CI: 14.6 -15.9). The progression rate was not consistently related to age or gender. By combining disease duration and progression rate, the model predicted that 15% or fewer of the worse eyes would reach the end of the field damage scale in the patient's lifetime. CONCLUSIONS. The estimates of typical worsening per year in the worse eye among subjects with OAG suggested slightly more rapid progression than in some clinic-based studies. The rate did not differ significantly by ethnicity or gender, but was worse in those with known, treated OAG and in pseudophakic subjects.

38549087466	Slit lamp-simulated oblique flashlight test in the detection of narrow angles in Chinese eyes: The Liwan eye study	PURPOSE. To assess a modified slit lamp-simulated oblique flashlight test in the identification of persons with suspected angle closure. METHODS. Standard oblique flashlight test (SOFT) and a modified slit lamp-simulated flashlight test (SSFT) were performed on participants identified as primary angle closure suspects and controls from a population-based study. SOFT graded the iris shadow on the nasal iris as shallow, medium, and deep. SSFT measured the length of iris shadow and corneal diameter by a slit lamp graticule eyepiece after standardizing the illumination parallel to the iris plane. RESULTS. SOFT yielded sensitivity and specificity of 76.3% and 80.7% for the detection of eyes with two or more quadrants of pigmented trabecular meshwork not observed on static gonioscopy. Proportions of subjects in the "shallow" category increased from 9.6% in Shaffer angle width grade 4 to 82.3% in grade 0 and were 72.1% in those with steep, 56.7% in those with plateau, and 13.9% in those with regular iris profiles. SSFT yielded 84.8% sensitivity and 76.7% specificity using a cutoff of 0.18 for the ratio between iris shadow length and corneal diameter. This ratio was monotonically associated with the axial anterior chamber depth, and it was significantly greater in eyes with Shaffer angle width grade lower than 2 and significantly less in eyes with Shaffer angle width grades 3 and 4. Reproducibility of SSFT was high (paired t-test; P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. More accurate measurement by controlling illumination and following a more precise method to measure shadow formation may improve the performance characteristics of this test. However, this method does not appear appropriate for community-based screening because of its relatively low specificity. Copyright © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.

58849131406	Adherence with Topical Glaucoma Medication Monitored Electronically. The Travatan Dosing Aid Study	Purpose: To assess patient adherence and behaviors with topical once-daily therapy for glaucoma. Design: Prospective, observational cohort study. Participants: One hundred ninety-six patients with glaucoma who were being treated with a prostaglandin analog in 1 or both eyes at the Scheie or Wilmer Eye Institutes between August 2006 and June 2007. Methods: Detailed medical history was obtained from each patient. All subjects used the Travatan Dosing Aid (DA; Alcon, Fort Worth, TX) to administer travoprost as prescribed. Devices were collected at 3 months and the data of drop usage was downloaded using software provided with the dosing aid. Data were analyzed for the 8-week period starting 2 weeks after the enrollment visit and ending 2 weeks before the 3-month visit. Main Outcome Measures: Assessment of adherence and patterns of drop usage as indicated by the DA. Results: A total of 282 subjects consented to be in the study and 86 (30%) withdrew before study completion or had device errors, leaving 196 subjects (70%) with evaluable data at 3 months. The overall mean (±standard deviation) adherence rate was 0.71 (±0.24), ranging from 0.02 to 0.97. One hundred nine of these patients (55.6%) took greater than 75% of the expected doses. Those with adherence of less than 50% of expected doses showed substantially increased dose taking immediately after the office visit and just before the return visit at 3 months (P = 0.03). The mean adherence rate estimates of the physician and patient self-report were 0.77 and 0.95, respectively. The agreement between the physician assessment and DA-recorded adherence rate showed poor correlation for individual cases (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.00-0.19). Conclusions: Nearly 45% of patients using an electronic monitoring device who knew they were being monitored and were provided free medication used their drops less than 75% of the time. Patients reported far higher medication use than their actual behavior. The ability of the physician to identify which persons are poorly adherent from their self-report or from other subjective clues is poor.

79952280155	Lens vault, thickness, and position in chinese subjects with angle closure	Purpose To investigate the association of lens parametersspecifically, lens vault (LV), lens thickness (LT), and lens position (LP)with angle closure. Design Prospective, comparative study. Participants One hundred two Chinese subjects with angle closure (consisting of primary angle closure, primary angle-closure glaucoma, and previous acute primary angle closure) attending a glaucoma clinic and 176 normal Chinese subjects with open angles and no evidence of glaucoma recruited from an ongoing population-based cross-sectional study. Methods All participants underwent gonioscopy and anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Customized software was used to measure LV, defined as the perpendicular distance between the anterior pole of the crystalline lens and the horizontal line joining the 2 scleral spurs, on horizontal AS OCT scans. A-scan biometry (US-800; Nidek Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was used to measures LT and to calculate LP (defined as anterior chamber depth [ACD] +1/2 LT) and relative LP (RLP; defined as LP/axial length [AL]). Main Outcome Measures Lens parameters and angle closure. Results Significant differences between angle-closure and normal eyes were found for LV (901±265 vs. 316±272 μm; P<0.001), LT (4.20±0.92 vs. 3.90±0.73 mm; P = 0.01), LT-to-AL ratio (0.18±0.04 vs. 0.16±0.03; P<0.001), ACD (2.66±0.37 vs. 2.95±0.37 mm; P<0.001), and AL (22.86±0.93 vs. 23.92±1.37 mm; P<0.001), but no significant differences were found for LP (4.76±0.51 vs. 4.90±0.54 mm; P = 0.34) or RLP (0.21±0.02 vs. 0.20±0.02; P = 0.14). After adjusting for age, gender, ACD, LT, and RLP, increased LV was associated significantly with angle closure (odds ratio [OR], 48.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.8181.3, comparing lowest to highest quartile), but no association was found for LT (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 0.764.16), LP (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.596.31), or RLP (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 0.666.57). There was low correlation between LV and LT (Pearson's correlation coefficient [PCC], 0.17), between LV and RLP (PCC, 0.08), or between LV and LP (PCC, 0.2). Conclusions Eyes with angle closure have thicker lenses with greater LV compared with normal eyes. The LV, which represents the anterior portion of the lens, is a novel parameter independently associated with angle closure after adjusting for age, gender, ACD, and LT.

84861894574	Determinants of anterior chamber depth: The singapore chinese eye study	Purpose: Recent advances in anterior segment imaging have enabled the measurement of novel ocular biometric parameters, such as lens vault (LV), posterior corneal arc length (PCAL), and iris area. The aims of this study were to identify the determinants of anterior chamber depth (ACD) and to ascertain the relative importance of these determinants in Chinese persons in Singapore. Design: Population-based, cross-sectional study. Participants: One thousand sixty Chinese participants recruited from the Singapore Chinese Eye Study. Methods: All subjects underwent AS optical coherence tomography (OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Customized software (Zhongshan Angle Assessment Program, Guangzhou, China) was used to measure the AS-OCT parameters. Anterior chamber depth was determined using IOLMaster (Carl Zeiss Meditec). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess the association between ACD with ocular biometric and systemic parameters. A stepwise selection algorithm was used to identify sequentially the contribution of each independent variable. Main Outcome Measures: Anterior chamber depth and ocular biometric parameters. Results: The mean age (±standard deviation) of participants was 56.9±8.57 years and 50.5% were men. The mean ACD was 3.24±0.35 mm. The strongest determinants of ACD were LV (R

84867135531	In vivo analysis of vectors involved in pupil constriction in Chinese subjects with angle closure	PURPOSE: To evaluate the acceleration of pupil constriction (APC) in response to illumination using video anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) in angle closure and normal eyes. METHODS: This was an observational study of 342 Chinese subjects. Iris and angle changes in response to illumination were captured with real-time video recordings of AS-OCT and analyzed frame by frame. APC was calculated using a quadratic function, fitting pupil diameter to a time series. APC was divided into two vector components: acceleration of pupil block (APB) acting perpendicular to the lens surface and acceleration of iris stretch (AIS) acting toward the iris root. RESULTS: Of 342 eligible patients, 306 (89.5%) were available for analysis; of whom 136 (41.7%) had angle closure. After adjusting for age, sex, baseline pupil diameter, and iris thickness, APC was significantly lower in angle closure eyes (0.61 mm/s

84876577478	Associations of iris structural measurements in a Chinese population: The Singapore Chinese eye study	PURPOSE. We determined the ocular biometric and demographic factors associated with iris parameters in Singaporean Chinese persons from a population-based sample. METHODS. Subjects were participants in the Singapore Chinese Eye Study, a population-based cross-sectional study of eye disease. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography images were analyzed using customized software to measure iris thickness at 750 lm from the scleral spur (IT750), iris area (I-Area), and iris curvature (I-Curv). Regression analyses were performed to assess the association between iris measurements with a range of demographic and ocular variables. The contribution of each independent variable to the iris parameter of interest was determined sequentially using a stepwise selection algorithm. RESULTS. We included 1473 participants with a mean age of 57.7 ± 8.68 years, and 50.6% were men. The mean IT750, I-Area, and I-Curv were 0.46 ± 0.10 mm, 1.49 ± 0.24 mm

84888014400	Subgrouping of primary angle-closure suspects based on anterior segment optical coherence tomography parameters	Purpose To identify subgroups of primary angle-closure suspects (PACS) based on anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) and biometric parameters. Design Cross-sectional study. Participants We evaluated 243 PACS subjects in the primary group and 165 subjects in the validation group. Methods Participants underwent gonioscopy and AS-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Customized software (Zhongshan Angle Assessment Program, Guangzhou, China) was used to measure AS-OCT parameters. An agglomerative hierarchical clustering method was first used to determine the optimum number of parameters to be included in the determination of subgroups. The best number of subgroups was then determined using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) methods. Main Outcome Measures Subgroups of PACS. Results The mean age of the subjects was 64.8 years, and 65.02% were female. After hierarchical clustering, 1 or 2 parameters from each cluster were chosen to ensure representativeness of the parameters and yet keep a minimum of redundancy. The parameters included were iris area, anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber width (ACW), and lens vault (LV). With the use of GMM, the optimal number of subgroups as given by AIC was 3. Subgroup 1 was characterized by a large iris area, subgroup 2 was characterized by a large LV and a shallow ACD, and subgroup 3 was characterized by elements of both subgroups 1 and 2. The results were replicated in a second independent group of 165 PACS subjects. Conclusions Clustering analysis identified 3 distinct subgroups of PACS subjects based on AS-OCT and biometric parameters. These findings may be relevant for understanding angle-closure pathogenesis and management.

43649088112	Anterior Chamber Angle Assessment Techniques	Angle-closure glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Diagnosis and treatment are intricately related to angle assessment techniques. This article reviews the literature on angle assessment and provides recommendations about optimal techniques based on the published evidence. Specifically, we review gonioscopy, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and anterior segment optical coherence tomography, all of which can be used to assess the anterior chamber angle directly. In addition, we discuss surrogate approaches to measuring the angle configuration, including limbal anterior chamber depth measurement, scanning peripheral anterior chamber depth measurement, and Scheimpflug photography. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

54949104328	Prevalence and Causes of Low Vision and Blindness in a Rural Chinese Adult Population. The Handan Eye Study	Purpose: To describe the prevalence and causes of low vision and blindness in a rural population in Northern China. Design: Population-based, cross-sectional study. Participants: A study of 6830 Han Chinese aged 30 years and older was conducted between October 2006 and October 2007 in rural Yongnian County in Handan, Northern China. Methods: Clustered samples of adults aged 30 years or more residing in 13 residential villages were selected randomly and were invited to participate the Handan Eye Study. Participants underwent a comprehensive eye examination, including standardized visual acuity (VA) tests using logarithm of the minimum angle resolution charts. Prevalence was age- and gender-standardized to the 2000 China Census. Main Outcome Measures: Low vision was defined as VA <20/60 but ≥20/400, and blindness was defined as VA <20/400 following the Modified World Health Organization (WHO) definitions. Primary causes of low vision and blindness were determined by study ophthalmologists according to WHO definitions. Results: Six thousand eight hundred thirty (90.4%) of 7577 eligible individuals participated in the study, and 6799 (89.7%) had VA data available. Population-weighted prevalence of presenting bilateral blindness was 0.6% and bilateral low vision was 4.7% for persons 30 years of age and older. Based on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), the corresponding prevalence of blindness was 0.5% and that of low vision was 1.0%. Blindness and low vision were strongly age related (P<0.05). Cataract was the predominant cause of presenting bilateral blindness (36.6%), whereas undercorrected refractive error was the predominant cause of presenting low vision (78.4%). After refractive correction, cataract became the first leading cause of blindness (41.9%), and low vision (48.2%), myopic retinopathy (16.1%), glaucoma (9.7%), and corneal opacity (9.7%) were other common causes of blindness defined using BCVA. Conclusions: A higher prevalence of blindness and low vision was seen in this rural Chinese sample than has been reported from urban Chinese populations. The estimated numbers with BCVA-defined low vision and blindness in 2020, based on best-corrected vision in rural Chinese adults aged 30 years or more, is expected to be 12.4 million and 2.9 million, respectively. Predominant causes of low vision and blindness in China are treatable.

57149085122	Quantitative analysis of anterior segment optical coherence tomography images: The zhongshan angle assessment program	Aim: To describe a new image analysis method and software for anterior chamber images obtained by the anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) and to assess its intraobserver and interobserver measurement reproducibility. Methods: Twenty 8-bit greyscale 600×300 AS-OCT images with apparent wide angles and 20 images with apparent narrow angles were consecutively selected from a database. Two glaucoma fellowship-trained ophthalmologists used proprietary image analysis software to analyse the images twice. Algorithms defined the borders and curvatures of anterior chamber (AC) structures and measured AC parameters using scleral spur location as the only observer input. The intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of scleral spur location and angle parameters was calculated in terms of limits of agreement (LOA; mean of differences ± 1.96SD of differences) and coefficient of variation (CV; SD of differences/overall mean). Results: The analysis software successfully measured all parameters in all images. When the same image was assessed twice by the same grader, the mean differences ranged from 0 to 0.010 mm in linear measurements and 0.001 to 0.006 mm

61349100111	Prevalence of Diabetic Retinopathy in Rural China: The Handan Eye Study	Purpose: To describe the age- and gender-specific prevalence, characteristics, and severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a rural population in northern China. Design: A population-based cross-sectional study. Participants: A total of 6830 Han Chinese aged 30 years and older from 13 villages of Yongnian County, Handan City, Hebei Province, China. Methods: All participants underwent a standardized interview, a comprehensive eye examination, and fasting blood glucose testing according to the American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria (fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/l). Retinal photographs obtained after pupil dilation were graded for the presence and severity of DR according to the modified Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study classification system. Main Outcome Measures: Any DR, retinopathy grades, macular edema, or vision-threatening retinopathy. Results: Of the 6830 eligible individuals participating in the study, 5597 (81.9%) had fasting blood glucose results available. Of these, 387 participants (6.9%) were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, including 247 subjects with new diabetes mellitus (NDM) and 140 subjects with known diabetes mellitus (KDM). For these, gradable photographs were available for 368 subjects (95.1%). The overall prevalence of DR was 43.1% (95% confidence interval, 38.1-48.4) and was higher in persons with KDM (65.2%) than NDM (33.5%). The prevalence of proliferative DR, macular edema, and vision-threatening retinopathy was 1.6%, 5.2%, and 6.3%, respectively, with 12.1% with KDM having untreated vision-threatening DR. No age- or gender-related differences were present. The prevalence of DR was strongly related to duration of disease. Conclusions: Our study reports a high prevalence of DR among adults 30 years and older with diabetes in rural China. On the basis of estimates obtained from our study, we projected that in rural China, 21.1 million persons aged 30+ years have diabetes and 9.2 million have DR, including 1.3 million with vision-threatening DR. There is a pressing need for appropriate screening and management of diabetes and its complications in rural China.

62649175351	A two-site, population-based study of barriers to cataract surgery in rural China	PURPOSE. China has among the lowest cataract surgical rates in Asia. This study was conducted to identify barriers to cataract surgery in rural China. METHODS. All subjects having undergone cataract surgery and persons with presenting visual acuity ≤6/60 (in Yangjiang) or ≤6/18 (in Handan) in ≥1 eye due to nonsurgically treated cataract were identified in two population-based studies in southern (Yangjiang) and northern (Handan) China. The subjects were administered a questionnaire assessing attitudes in four areas constituting potential barriers to surgery: knowledge about cataract, perceptions of local surgical quality, transportation and cost, and available resources. RESULTS. Interviews were completed on 71% to 86% of eligible subjects in both sites. Interviewed subjects did not differ significantly from nonrespondents with regard to age, sex, and presenting acuity in the better-seeing eye. A total of 214 (80.4%) nonsurgical and 131 (76.6%) surgical participants were interviewed, with a mean age of 71.8 ± 8.0 and 73.7 ± 7.4 years, respectively (P > 0.1). Among the nonsurgical subjects, 67.8% were blind (presenting vision, ≤6/60) in ≥1 eye due to cataract, whereas among the surgical participants, 25.2% remained blind in the eye that had undergone surgical removal of the cataract. In a multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, and site, increased knowledge and higher estimates of the quality of surgery were associated with having had surgery, whereas cost and transportation scores were not. CONCLUSIONS. Lack of knowledge about cataract and concerns about the quality of local services appear to be the principal barriers to cataract surgery in rural China. © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.

65449182079	Rationale, design, methodology, and baseline data of apopulation-based study in rural China: The handan eye study	Purpose: To describe the rationale, design, methodology and baseline characteristics of the Handan Eye Study (HES), a population-based study to determine the prevalence and impact of visual impairment and major ocular diseases in Chinese adults living in a rural region north China. Methods: Population-based, cross-sectional study. 6830 Han people aged 30 years and older from 13 villages of Yongnian County, Handan city, Hebei province, China were recruited. The interviews covered demographic, behavioral, and ocular risk factors as well as health-related and vision-related quality of life. Ocular examination included measurement of visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure, anterior and posterior segment examinations, visual field testing, and anterior segment, fundus and optic disc photography/imaging. Physical examination included measurement of height and weight, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, fasting blood glucose, lipid levels, urea nitrogen and creatinine as well as tests of physical function including walking speed. Results: Of the 7557 individuals eligible for the Handan Eye Study (HES), 6830 (90.4%) subjects participated the study. The majority of participants were female (53.6%), the average ( standard deviation) age was 52.3 ( 12.3) years, and 100% were self-identified Han people. In contrast to the non-participants, those who participated were more likely to be female, elderly, married, and had more years of education (P 0.05). Conclusion: The HES successfully examined over 90% of eligible Han Chinese adults aged 30 and older from a rural region of north China. Results from the HES will provide key information about the prevalence, risk factors, impact, and trends of ocular disease in rural regions of China.

65549125485	Prevalence and associations of epiretinal membranes in a rural Chinese adult population: The handan eye study	PURPOSE. To determine the prevalence and association of epiretinal membranes (ERMs), as assessed by retinal photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT), in a Chinese population. METHODS. The Handan Eye Study is a population-based study of eye disease in rural Chinese aged 30+ years. Eligible residents underwent a detailed ophthalmic examination including retinal photography and Stratus OCT. ERMs were defined by a combination of retinal photographs and OCT and classified as cellophane macular reflex (CMR) or preretinal macular fibrosis (PMF) based on retinal photographs characteristics. RESULTS. Of the 6830 persons examined, 6565 (96.1%) had gradable retinal photographs and/or OCT. The mean age was 51.7 ± 11.6 years. ERMs were present in 3.4% (95% CI: 2.9%-3.8%) of participants, bilateral in 20.3% of the cases. CMR was present in 2.2% and PMF in 0.7%, and ERMs were unclassified in 0.5% (detected by OCT only). ERM prevalence was similar in women and men (3.6% vs. 3.1%), strongly associated with increasing age (P for trend < 0.001). After adjustment for age and sex, primary ERM was associated positively with myopia (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.12- 2.23) and inversely with current smoking (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.38-0.97, versus never smoked). Best corrected visual acuity was significantly worse in eyes with primary ERMs (mean LogMAR score lower by 0.07, 95% CI: 0.05-0.10) than eyes without ERMs, after adjustment for age, sex, and lens status. CONCLUSIONS. ERMs affect 3.4% of the population 30+ years of age and living in rural China. Idiopathic ERMs were associated with myopia, decreased visual acuity, and inversely associated with smoking. © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.

65649117736	Iris cross-sectional area decreases with pupil dilation and its dynamic behavior is a risk factor in angle closure	PURPOSE: To estimate the change in iris cross-sectional (CS) area with pupil dilation using anterior segment optical coherence tomography comparing eyes with angle closure (AC) to open angle glaucoma (OAG). METHODS: Sixty-five patients from the Wilmer Glaucoma service, 36 with definite or suspected OAG and 29 with definite or suspected AC, underwent anterior segment optical coherence tomography imaging under 3 conditions (pupil constriction to light, physiologic dilation in the dark, and after pharmacologic dilation). The nasal and temporal iris CS areas were measured with custom software, 3 times in each of 4 meridians. The principal outcome variables were iris CS area and change in iris CS area/mm pupil diameter change. The relation of these parameters to potential variables that would influence iris area was estimated by multivariate regression. RESULTS: CS area was smaller in eyes with larger pupil diameter, those that had undergone trabeculectomy, and those of European-derived persons (P<0.05 for all in a univariate analysis). In a multivariate model with CS area as the dependent variable, larger pupil diameter (with a 0.19 mm decrease in CS area for each 1 mm of pupil enlargement, P=0.0002), and trabeculectomy remained significant factors. In a second multivariate model, AC irides had less change in CS area/mm pupil enlargement than OAG or OAG suspects (P=0.01). Change in iris CS area was essentially complete in 5 seconds (n=10 eyes). CONCLUSIONS: The iris loses nearly half its volume from a pupil diameter of 3 to 7 mm, probably by eliminating extracellular fluid. Smaller iris CS area change with physiologic pupil dilation is a potential risk factor for AC. Dynamic iris CS area change deserves testing as a prospective indicator of AC. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

67349227964	Risk Factors for Poor Adherence to Eyedrops in Electronically Monitored Patients with Glaucoma	Purpose: To identify risk factors for poor adherence to topical once daily therapy for glaucoma. Design: Prospective, observational cohort study. Participants: A total of 196 patients with glaucoma who were being treated with a prostaglandin analog in 1 or more eyes at the Scheie or Wilmer Eye Institutes between August 2006 and June 2007. Methods: Demographics, ocular history, and responses to interview questions about glaucoma knowledge, health beliefs, and drop-taking behaviors were obtained from each patient. All patients used the Travatan Dosing Aid (DA; Alcon Laboratories Inc., Fort Worth, TX) to administer travoprost as prescribed. Devices were collected at 3 months, and the data of drop use were downloaded using software provided with the DA. Patients taking ≤75% doses during the 8-week period starting 2 weeks after the enrollment visit and ending 2 weeks before the 3-month visit were compared with those taking >75% of doses. Main Outcome Measures: Risk factors for poor adherence. Results: Eighty-seven patients (44.4% of the 196 subjects with evaluable data at 3 months) used the DA on 75% or less of the monitored days. In univariate analysis, poorer adherers were more likely to be <50 or ≥80 years of age, to be African American, to report less than excellent health, to report higher amounts of depression, to have lower income, and to be treated at the Scheie Eye Institute. Multivariate analysis (adjusting for education and income) found that age, race/ethnicity, and less than excellent health were associated with poor adherence. Conclusions: Those who failed to take more than 75% of eyedrop doses were more likely to be African American and to report poor health. Those in the youngest and oldest age groups were less adherent, although this finding was not always statistically significant. Further research into the factors driving these associations and into developing predictive models to assist in screening for low adherence are warranted.

69249210971	Outcomes of Surgical Bleb Revision for Complications of Trabeculectomy	Objective: To describe the results of revision surgery for complications of trabeculectomy in a case series from an academic glaucoma service. Design: Retrospective case series. Participants: A total of 177 eyes of 167 adult patients who underwent revision of trabeculectomy at the Wilmer Eye Institute between 1994 and 2007. Methods: Three indications for surgery were identified: hypotony without leak, bleb leak, and bleb dysesthesia. Revision was deemed successful when all of the following were true: the primary indication was eliminated, further intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering surgery was not required, no major complication occurred, and a new bleb-related problem did not develop. Patients with less than 3 months of follow-up were excluded unless failure occurred earlier. Surgical procedures included variations on excision of thin or leaking conjunctiva with advancement. Main Outcome Measures: Change in IOP, change in visual acuity, need for further IOP-lowering surgery, and complications after bleb revision. Results: Subjects' mean age was 67±14 years, 54% were female, and mean follow-up was 2.8±2.7 years, with a mean interval from trabeculectomy to revision of 3.5±3.7 years. Overall success rate was 63% (112/177), which was slightly higher for leak repair (65%; 64/98) and hypotony (63%; 32/51) than for dysesthesia (57%; 16/28) indications. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, overall cumulative success rates at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years after bleb revision were 80%, 75%, 50%, and 41%, respectively. IOP and visual acuity improved significantly in both hypotony and leak groups (P values ranging from 0.004 to <0.0001). Additional IOP-lowering surgery was required in 9%. In multivariate regression analysis adjusting for age, gender, and number of prior surgeries, patients with glaucoma other than primary open-angle glaucoma were twice as likely to have failed bleb revision. Conclusions: Surgical bleb revision often provides successful resolution of bleb-related complications. Most patients maintain IOP control without need for further IOP-lowering surgery.

70349440976	A Randomized, Clinical Trial Evaluating Ready-Made and Custom Spectacles Delivered Via a School-Based Screening Program in China	Purpose: We sought to evaluate visual performance and satisfaction with ready-made spectacles (RMS) in Chinese school-aged children with uncorrected refractive error. Design: Randomized, double-blind, clinical trial. Participants: Junior high school students from urban Guangzhou, China, aged approximately 12 to 15 years with ≥1 diopter (D) of uncorrected spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error. Students were excluded with ≥2.00 D astigmatism, ≥2 D myopic anisometropia, and ≥1 D hyperopic anisometropia and ocular disease affecting vision. Methods: Refractive error was determined by cycloplegic subjective refraction. Students were randomly assigned to receive RMS or custom spectacles (CS) and assessed after 1 month of use. We required 175 students to complete in each arm to be able to measure a 15% difference in compliance. Main Outcome Measures: Compliance with spectacles lens wear, patterns of use, vision, symptoms, and perceived value. Results: Screening identified 965 of 4607 (20.9%) students with reduced distance vision; 212 of the 965 (22.0%) refused evaluation and 187 of the 965 (20.8%) had <1 D of SE refractive error. Sixty-one (6.3%) were referred for further evaluation and the remaining 495 (51.3%) participated. Social, demographic, and ocular parameters were similar in the 2 groups. Average SE refractive error was -2.57±1.31 (mean value ± standard deviation [SD]). Spectacle vision (Snellen acuity, mean ± SD) was worse with RMS in the eye with lower SE (20/25

70350567771	Refractive Errors in a Rural Chinese Adult Population. The Handan Eye Study	Purpose: To describe the prevalence of and risk factors for myopia and other refractive errors in a rural, adult, Chinese population. Design: Population-based, cross-sectional study. Participants: A clustered, random sampling procedure was used to select 7557 Chinese people aged ≥30 years from Handan, China. Methods: All eligible subjects were invited to undergo a comprehensive eye examination, including standardized refraction. Myopia, high myopia, and hyperopia were defined as a spherical equivalent (SE) in the right eye of more than -0.5 diopter (D), less than -5.0 D, and 0.5 D or more, respectively. Astigmatism was less than -0.5 D of cylinder. Anisometropia was defined as a difference in SE of >1.0 D between the 2 eyes. Only phakic eyes were analyzed. Main Outcome Measures: Myopia and other refractive errors. Results: We included 6491 (85.9% participation rate) eligible subjects in this study. Adjusted to the 2000 China population census, the prevalence rate of myopia was 26.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.6-27.8), hyperopia 15.9 % (95% CI, 15.0-16.8), astigmatism 24.5% (95% CI, 23.5-25.5), and anisometropia 7.7% (95% CI, 7.0-8.4). The prevalence of high myopia was 1.8% (95% CI, 1.5-2.1). Using a multivariate regression model, current smoking (odds ratio [OR], 0.7, 95% CI, 0.5-0.9), hours of reading (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.4), diabetes (OR, 8.4; 95% CI, 2.2-32.5), and number of family members with myopia (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7, for each family member) were associated with myopia in younger persons (30-49 years). High school or higher education (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1), diabetes (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7), nuclear opacity (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3), and number of family members with myopia (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9) were risk factors in persons ≥50 years of age. Conclusions: Myopia affects more than one quarter of rural Chinese persons ≥30 years of age. Myopia is more common in younger people and is associated with different risk factors than in older people.

70649107816	Interventions Improve Poor Adherence with Once Daily Glaucoma Medications in Electronically Monitored Patients	Purpose: To investigate the impact of an intervention program to improve adherence with topical, once daily therapy for glaucoma. Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants: Sixty-six patients with glaucoma being treated with a prostaglandin analog in 1 or both eyes at the Scheie Eye Institute or Wilmer Eye Institute between November 2006 and June 2007. Methods: In an observational study, participants who took 75% or fewer doses (as measured using the travoprost Dosing Aid [DA]) during an initial 3-month period were randomized into 2 groups. The intervention group watched an educational video, reviewed current barriers to drop-taking and possible solutions with a study coordinator, received regular phone call reminders, and had audible and visible reminders activated on their DA devices. The control group was told to take drops as prescribed and received no additional intervention. Main Outcome Measures: Change in drop use adherence as determined by the DA device. Results: In the 3-month observation period before randomization, intervention group patients had used a mean of 54±17% of scheduled doses, and this increased to 73±22% during the following 3-month period (P<0.001, n = 35). The control mean adherence rate of 46±23% at baseline was statistically unchanged during the follow-up observation period (51±30%, P = 0.16, n = 31). In a multivariate analysis, intervention, baseline compliance rate of <50%, and white ethnicity were predictors of improved adherence during the 3 months of intervention. The intraocular pressure (IOP) of the intervention and control groups did not change between months 3 and 6 after intervention (P = 0.96, 0.34, respectively), and there was no correlation of IOP change with adherence rate change between both groups (Pearson correlation r = 0.06, P = 0.51). Conclusions: A multifaceted intervention significantly increased adherence with glaucoma medications. Those with improved adherence were in the intervention group, had very low adherence rates at baseline, and were white. IOP did not correlate with adherence. Further research is needed to determine which components of this intervention were most effective.

72749112549	Quantitative Iris Parameters and Association with Narrow Angles	Purpose: To investigate the relationship between quantitative iris parameters (iris curvature [I-Curv], iris area [I-Area], and iris thickness) and the presence of narrow angles. Design: Cross-sectional, community-based study. Participants: We recruited 2047 subjects >50 years old without ophthalmic symptoms from a community clinic in Singapore. Methods: All subjects underwent gonioscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) under dark conditions. An eye was considered to have narrow angles if the posterior pigmented trabecular meshwork was not visible for ≥180° on nonindentation gonioscopy with the eye in the primary position. Customized software was used on horizontal AS-OCT scans to measure I-Curv, I-Area, and iris thickness 750 μm (IT750) and 2000 μm (IT2000) from the scleral spur. The average of both temporal and nasal measured values of the right eye was used for analysis. Main Outcome Measures: The association between iris parameters and narrow angles on gonioscopy. Results: Iris parameters from 1465 eyes (71.6%) were available for analysis. Of these, 315 subjects (21.5%) had narrow angles. The mean I-Curv (0.366 vs 0.259 mm; P<0.020), IT750 (0.476 vs 0.453 mm; P<0.001), and IT2000 (0.491 vs 0.482 mm; P = 0.010) were greater in persons with than without narrow angles. After adjusting for age, gender, anterior chamber depth, axial length, and pupil size, the greater I-Curv, I-Area, IT750, and IT2000 were significantly associated with narrow angles (odds ratio [OR] 2.5 and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-5.1; OR, 2.7 and 95% CI, 1.6-4.8; OR, 2.6 and 95% CI, 1.6-4.1; OR, 2.7 and 95% CI, 1.5-4.7, comparing 4th with 1st quartile for each parameter, respectively). In stratified analysis, women and subjects aged ≥60 years had stronger associations for most iris parameters with narrow angles than men and younger subjects. Conclusions: Quantitative iris parameters (I-Curv, I-Area, and iris thickness) are independently associated with narrow angles, particularly in women and older subjects. These data provide further insights into the pathogenesis of angle closure in Singaporeans.

77049123433	Retinopathy in Persons without Diabetes. The Handan Eye Study	Purpose: To describe the prevalence and associations of retinopathy in a population-based nondiabetic sample of rural Chinese. Design: Population-based cross-sectional study. Participants: We included 6830 Han Chinese aged ≥30 years from 13 villages of Yongnian County, Handan City, Hebei Province, China. Methods: All participants underwent a standardized interview and extensive examinations including retinal photography, measurement of blood pressure (BP) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Diabetes mellitus was defined as either FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/l, use of diabetic medication or a physician diagnosis of diabetes. Photographic grading of retinopathy followed the modified Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study classification system. Logistic regression models were used to assess associations of retinopathy. Main Outcome Measures: Any retinopathy. Results: The prevalence of retinopathy among participants without diabetes was 13.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.6-14.6%). The age and gender standardized prevalence of retinopathy in the Chinese adult population (aged 30+ years) without diabetes was estimated to be 12.1% (95% CI 11.1-12.9%). Independent risk factors associated with retinopathy were age (odds ratio [OR], 1.02 ; 95% CI 1.01-1.03 per year increase), male gender (male vs. female, OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.08-1.49), higher FPG (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.11-1.53 per mmol/l increase), higher systolic BP (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.05-1.27 per 10 mmHg increase) and higher diastolic BP (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.09-1.22 per 10 mmHg increase). Conclusions: Retinopathy was common among rural Chinese adults without diabetes. Its association with FPG and BP suggests that early microvascular damage is occurring at "high normal" levels of blood glucose and BP.

77955470855	Normal macular thickness measurements using optical coherence tomography in healthy eyes of adult Chinese persons: The Handan Eye Study	Purpose: To describe macular thickness measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in healthy eyes of adult Chinese persons. Design: Population-based cross-sectional study. Participants: Chinese adults aged 30+ years who were residents of Handan, North China. Methods: The Handan Eye Study is a population-based study of eye disease in Chinese persons. Eligible residents underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination including OCT (Stratus OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Jena, Germany). Fast macular thickness scans were performed over maculae within 6 mm in diameter, divided into 3 regions (central, inner, and outer, with a diameter of 1, 3, and 6 mm, respectively) and 9 quadrants (1 in the central region and 4 each in the inner and outer regions). Retinal thickness (means and standard deviations) was calculated by OCT mapping software, presented for foveal minimum, central macula (within 1 mm diameter), and inner and outer regions divided by 8 quadrants. Main Outcome Measures: Macular thickness measured by OCT. Results: Of the 6830 participants (90.4% response rate) examined, 2230 eyes of healthy subjects with high-quality OCT scans were selected (32.7% of participants; mean age, 46.4±9.9 years, 58.4% were women). The mean foveal minimum, central, inner, and outer macular thicknesses were 150.3 (18.1) μm, 176.4 (17.5) μm, 255.3 (14.9) μm, and 237.7 (12.4) μm, respectively (overall differences, P<0.001).

77955859682	Distribution of ocular perfusion pressure and its relationship with open-angle glaucoma: The singapore malay eye study	Purpose. To describe the distribution of ocular perfusion pressure and its relationship with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) in a Malay population. Methods. This was a population-based, cross-sectional study comprising 3280 (78.7% response) ethnic Malays. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured with Goldmann applanation tonometry. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) was measured with a digital automatic blood pressure monitor. Mean ocular perfusion pressure (MOPP) = 2/3(mean arterial pressure - IOP), where mean arterial pressure (MAP) = DBP + 1/3(SBP - DBP), systolic perfusion pressure (SPP) = SBP - IOP, and diastolic perfusion pressure (DPP) = DBP - IOP, was calculated. The diagnosis of OAG was based on International Society for Geographical and Epidemiologic Ophthalmology criteria. Results. A total of 3261 persons (mean age, 58.7 ±11 years, including 131 [4.0%] cases of OAG) were available for analyses. Among persons without glaucoma, the mean ± SD IOP, MOPP, SPP, and DPP were 15.3 ± 35, 52.8 ± 93, 1315 ± 23.3, and 64.5 ± 11.3 mm Hg, respectively. Among persons with OAG, the corresponding values were 16.8 ± 5.9, 51.6 ± 10.2, 134.5 ± 24.6, and 61.4 ± 11.5 mm Hg, respectively. In multiple logistic regression models adjusting for IOP, age, sex, and IOP- and BP-lowering treatments, OAG risk was significantly higher in participants with DBP, MOPP, or DPP in the lowest quartile (Q1) than in participants in the highest quartile (Q4) (Q1 vs. Q4: odds ratio [OR], 1.71 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-2.96] for DBP; OR, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.05-3.15] for MOPP; OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.02-3.01] for DPP). Conclusions. Low DBP, low MOPP, and low DPP are independent risk factors for OAG in ethnic Malays, providing further evidence of a vascular mechanism in glaucoma pathogenesis across different populations. © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.

77957988514	Predictors of early acceptance of free spectacles provided to junior high school students in China	Objective: To examine factors influencing adherence to spectacle wear and perceived value within a prospective 1-month trial of ready-made and custom spectacles in school-aged children with uncorrected refractive error in urban China. Methods: A total of 428 students aged 12 to 15 years with at least 1 diopter of uncorrected refractive error were given free spectacles and evaluated 1 month later at an unannounced visit. Demographic factors, vision, optical effects, and perceptions were modeled as predictors of observed use and perceived value using logistic regression adjusted for spectacle allocation. Results: Of 415 students, 388 (93.5%) planned to use their spectacles, 227 (54.7%) valued their spectacles highly, 204 (49.2%) had their spectacles on hand, and 13 (3.0%) were lost to follow-up. Female students were 1.72 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.68), students from lower income households were 1.78 times (1.32-2.39), and those not concerned over appearance were 2.04 times (1.25-3.36) more likely to have spectacles on hand. Students with a pupil size of 4 mm or greater were 2.55 times (95% CI, 1.61-4.03) and students with spectacle vision worse than 20/20 were 2.06 times (1.20-3.49) more likely to have spectacles on hand. Self-report of high perceived value was 2.23 times (95% CI, 1.30-3.80) more likely with 20/20 spectacle vision, 1.63 times (1.06-2.52) more likely with base-in prismatic effects of 0.5 prism diopters or more, 3.52 times (2.03-6.13) more likely when students would not tolerate blur to avoid wearing spectacles, and 2.16 times (1.24-3.76) more likely with disbelief that spectacles would make vision worse. Spectacle type had no effect. Conclusions: Although most students planned to use their spectacles, only half were observed using them. Day-to-day use might increase if students were less concerned over appearance. Optical factors and beliefs surrounding spectacles are also predictive of acceptance. These findings provide further understanding of spectacle acceptance in teenagers. ©2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

77958001299	Diagnostic performance of anterior chamber angle measurements for detecting eyes with narrow angles: An anterior segment OCT study	Objective: To assess the diagnostic performance of angle measurements from anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images for identifying eyes with narrow angles. Methods: We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study of individuals 50 years or older who had phakic eyes and who underwent AS-OCT imaging in the dark by a single operator and gonioscopy by an ophthalmologist masked to AS-OCT findings. An eye was considered to have narrow angles if the posterior pigmented trabecular meshwork was not visible for at least 180° on gonioscopy. Horizontal AS-OCT images were analyzed for the following measurements using customized software: angle opening distance (AOD) at 250, 500, and 750 μm from the scleral spur; trabecular-iris space area (TISA) at 500 and 750 μm; and angle recess area (ARA) at 750 μm. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were generated for AOD, TISA, and ARA to assess the performance of these measurements in detecting eyes with narrow angles. Results: Of 2047 individuals examined, 582 were excluded mostly because of poor image quality or inability to locate the scleral spur. Of the remaining 1465 participants, 315 (21.5%) had narrow angles on gonioscopy. Mean (SD) age was 62.7 (7.7) years, 54.1% were women, and 90.0% were Chinese. The AUCs were highest for AOD750 in the nasal (0.90 [95% confidence interval, 0.89-0.92]) and temporal (0.91 [0.90-0.93]) quadrants. Conclusions: The AOD750 is the most useful angle measurement for identifying individuals with gonioscopic narrow angles in gradable AS-OCT images. Poor definition of the scleral spur precludes quantitative analysis in approximately 25% of AS-OCT images. ©2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

77957584363	Novel association of smaller anterior chamber width with angle closure in Singaporeans	Purpose: To describe variations in anterior chamber width (ACW) and investigate its association with the presence of narrow angles. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: We recruited 2047 subjects aged 50 years or more from a community polyclinic and 111 subjects with primary angle closure (PAC) or primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) from an eye hospital in Singapore. Methods: All participants underwent gonioscopy, anterior chamber depth (ACD) and axial length (AL) measurement (IOLMaster; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), and anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT, Visante, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Customized software was used to measure the ACW, defined as the distance between the scleral spurs in the horizontal (nasal-temporal) axis of AS-OCT scans. An eye was deemed to have narrow angles if the posterior trabecular meshwork was not visible for at least 180 degrees on non-indentation gonioscopy with the eye in the primary position. Main Outcome Measures: Anterior chamber width and narrow angles. Results: Data on 1465 community-based subjects were available for analysis. Anterior chamber width was significantly smaller in women compared with men (11.70 mm vs. 11.81 mm, respectively, P<0.001) and decreased significantly with age (P for trend <0.001). Significant predictors of smaller ACW were lower educational level, lower body mass index, shorter AL, shallower ACD, and Chinese race. Of the 1465 subjects, 315 (21.5%) had narrow angles on gonioscopy. Mean ACW was smaller in eyes with narrow angles compared with those without narrow angles (11.60 mm vs. 11.80 mm, P<0.001). The age- and gender-adjusted odds ratio for the highest quartile compared with the lower 3 quartiles of ACW with the presence of narrow angles was 3.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.35.0; P for trend <0.001). Hospital-based subjects with PAC/PACG had even smaller ACW than community subjects with narrow angles (11.33 mm vs. 11.60 mm, P<0.001). Conclusions: In this cross-sectional study, ACW was smaller in women, Chinese persons, and older persons, and was associated with narrow angles in 2 different study populations. These data suggest that a smaller ACW may represent a novel risk indicator for angle closure.

77957298331	Design and methodology of a randomized controlled trial of laser iridotomy for the prevention of angle closure in Southern China: The zhongshan angle closure prevention trial	Purpose: To summarize the design and methodology of a large-scale trial in southern China, the Zhongshan Angle Closure Prevention (ZAP) trial. This trial will determine if laser iridotomy (LI) is superior to no treatment for managing Chinese people who are Primary Angle Closure Suspects (PACS). In this trial, PACS was defined as having 6 or more clock hours of angle circumference in which the pigmented trabecular meshwork was not visible under static gonioscopy in both eyes without elevated intraocular pressure, peripheral anterior synechiae or glaucomatous neuropathy. Methods: Subjects were recruited from an urban district in Guangzhou. The target sample size was 870. Persons 50 years of age and older with 20/40 or better vision in both eyes identified as having 6 or more clock hours of angle circumference in which the pigmented trabecular meshwork was not visible under static gonioscopy in both eyes were enrolled. Each subject was randomized to undergo LI in one eye with the fellow eye left untreated. Follow up is planned for a minimum period of 3 years. Baseline examination included tonometry, limbal chamber depth grading, gonioscopy, fundus photography, anterior segment coherence tomography, ultrasound A scan, ultrasound biomicroscopy, specular microscopy and dark room provocative testing. Endpoints for the study include developing elevated intraocular pressure, peripheral anterior synechiae or experiencing acute primary angle closure. Conclusion: The ZAP trial will determine if LI is safe and effective at preventing pathological angle closure in asymptomatic eyes with narrow angle configurations on gonioscopy. It will also provide data on what happens to untreated eyes in PACSs. Data collected at baseline will also help identify those at high risk for developing primary angle closure and primary angle closure glaucoma. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

78650837990	Increased iris thickness and association with primary angle closure glaucoma	Aims: To investigate the relationship between quantitative iris parameters and angle closure disease. Methods: Participants with angle closure were recruited prospectively from glaucoma clinics. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) was performed under standardised dark conditions. Customised software was used on horizontal AS-OCT scans to measure iris thickness at 750 um (IT750) and 2000 um (IT2000) from the sclera spur, maximal iris thickness (ITM) and cross-sectional area of the iris (I-Area). Results: 167 Angle closure (consisting of 50 primary angle-closure (PAC), 73 primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) and 44 fellow eyes of acute PAC) and 1153 normal participants were examined. After adjusting for age, sex, pupil size and anterior chamber depth, mean IT750 (0.499 vs 0.451 mm, p<0.001), IT2000 (0.543 vs 0.479 mm, p<0.001), ITM (0.660 vs 0.602 mm, p<0.001) and I-Area (1.645 vs 1.570 mm

79551512796	Prevalence and causes of amblyopia in a rural adult population of Chinese: The Handan Eye Study	Objective: To determine the prevalence of and factors associated with amblyopia in a rural Chinese population. Design: Population-based, cross-sectional study. Participants: Six thousand eight hundred thirty Han Chinese aged 30 years or more, recruited from Yongnian County, Handan, Hebei Province, China. Methods: Thirteen villages in the Yongnian County of Handan were selected randomly, and residents of these selected villages 30 years of age or older were invited to participate in the Handan Eye Study. Participants underwent a comprehensive eye examination, including standardized visual acuity (VA) tests using logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution charts. Prevalence rates were age- and gender-standardized to the 2000 China census. Main Outcome Measures: The proportion of rural Chinese population aged 30 years or older with amblyopia. Unilateral amblyopia was diagnosed if best-corrected VA (BCVA) was 20/32 or worse in the amblyopic eye and was not attributable directly to any underlying structural abnormality of the eye or visual pathway. Bilateral amblyopia was diagnosed if BCVA was 20/32 or less in both eyes and if there was a history of form deprivation during the sensitive period of visual development, such as media opacities or high, uncorrected ametropia. Results: Amblyopia was diagnosed in 205 participants, with an age- and gender-adjusted prevalence of 2.8%. Of these, 1.7% were unilateral cases and 1.1% were bilateral cases. Underlying causes included anisometropia (67.3%), strabismus (5.4%), mixed strabismus and anisometropia (4.4%), visual deprivation (9.8%), astigmatism association (9.8%), and other (3.4%). Of the amblyopia cases, 47.6% were hypermetropic. Conclusions: In this rural Chinese population, 2.8% of adults 30 to 80 years of age had amblyopia, a prevalence rate broadly consistent with that of most other studies. One third of the cases were bilateral, and anisometropia was the most common cause of this condition.

79955784847	Association of narrow angles with anterior chamber area and volume measured with anterior-segment optical coherence tomography	Objectives: To describe the measurement of anterior chamber area and anterior chamber volume by anteriorsegment optical coherence tomography and to investigate the association of these parameters with the presence of narrow angles. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of subjects aged at least 50 years without ophthalmic symptoms recruited from a community clinic. All participants underwent standardized ocular examination and anterior-segment optical coherence tomography. Customized software was used to measure anterior chamber area (cross-sectional area bounded by the corneal endothelium, anterior surface of iris, and lens within the pupil) and anterior chamber volume (calculated by rotating the anterior chamber area 360° around a vertical axis through the midpoint of the anterior chamber area). An eye was considered to have narrow angles if the posterior pigmented trabecular meshwork was not visible for at least 180° on gonioscopy with the eye in the primary position. Results: A total of 1922 subjects were included in the final analyses, 317 (16.5%) of whom had narrow angles. Mean anterior chamber area (15.6 vs 21.1 mm

79958103352	Risk factors for diabetic retinopathy in a rural Chinese population with type 2 diabetes: The Handan Eye Study	Purpose: To describe risk factors associated with diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a population-based sample of rural Chinese with type 2 diabetes. Methods: The Handan Eye Study is a population-based cross-sectional study surveyed 6830 Chinese people aged 30+ years from 13 randomly selected villages in 2006-2007. All participants underwent a standardized interview and extensive examinations including ophthalmologic and systemic conditions. Diabetic retinopathy was graded from fundus photographs according to the modified Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study classification system. Logistic regression models were used to assess risk factors associated with DR. Results: Of 7577 eligible persons, 6830 (90.4%) participated, of which 5597 (81.9%) had fasting plasma glucose (FPG) data. There were 387 (6.9%) participants with diabetes, and 368 (95.1%) had gradable fundus photographs. The age-standardized prevalence of DR was 43.1%. In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models for all diabetic participants, independent risk factors for DR were longer duration of diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 3.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.94, 4.85, per 5 years of duration), higher FPG levels (OR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.27, per mmol/l increase) and higher systolic blood pressure (OR 1.22; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.37, per 10 mmHg increase). For newly diagnosed diabetes, the only significant factor of DR was higher FPG levels (OR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.29, per mmol/l increase). Conclusions: In rural Chinese persons with diabetes, longer diabetes duration, hyperglycaemia and elevated blood pressure are risk factors for DR. These findings underscore the importance of controlling classic risk factors for DR in developing countries, where diabetes prevalence is increasing. © 2011 The Authors.

79959946409	Prevalence of age-related macular degeneration in a rural Chinese population: The handan eye study	Purpose: To describe the prevalence of age-related degeneration (AMD) in a rural Chinese population and to assess its associations with age, gender, and smoking. Design: Population-based cross-sectional. Participants: Persons aged 30+ years, recruited between October 2006 and October 2007, from Yongnian County, Handan, Hebei Province, China. Methods: All participants underwent a standardized interview and comprehensive eye examinations, including digital retinal photography of both eyes. Trained graders assessed the presence and severity of AMD lesions following the modified Wisconsin Age-related Maculopathy Grading System (WARMGS) used in the Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES). Direct age standardization to the world population (year 2000) was performed to compare the prevalence across different populations. Main Outcome Measures: AMD and WARMGS. Results: Of 6830 participates, fundus photographs were gradable for 6581 persons (96.4%), including 4049 aged 50+ years. Early and late AMD prevalence rates were 3.0% and 0.1%, respectively, among participants. The age-standardized prevalence rates among participants aged 50+ years were 4.7% and 0.2%, respectively. After controlling for age, men had a higher prevalence of early (3.9% vs. 2.3%, odds ratio [OR] 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32.2) and late AMD (0.1% vs. 0.03%; OR 3.5; CI, 0.433.4) compared with women. Older age (sex-adjusted OR 1.7; CI, 1.32.2 per decade of age) and current smoking (age-sex-adjusted OR 1.4; CI, 1.02.1) were significantly associated with early AMD prevalence. The proportion of current smokers was substantially higher in men (58.7%) than in women (0.3%). The attributable risk of early AMD from smoking among Chinese men was 24.2%. After controlling for current smoking, the excess prevalence of early AMD in men compared with women reduced by 50% (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 0.92.0). Conclusions: The prevalence of early AMD in this rural Chinese sample was similar to white persons in the BMES and Asian Malays in the Singapore Malay Eye Study. Late AMD prevalence, however, was lower. Higher prevalence rates for early and late AMD in men compared with women were largely attributed to substantially higher proportions of smokers in rural Chinese men than in women.

80052813646	Prevalence and characteristics of myopic retinopathy in a rural Chinese adult population: The Handan Eye Study	Objective: To determine the prevalence, characteristics, and risk factors for myopic retinopathy in a rural population in Northern China. Methods: The Handan Eye Study is a population-based study of eye disease in rural Chinese individuals 30 years or older. Eligible residents underwent a detailed ophthalmic examination including standardized visual acuity tests and retinal photography after pupil dilation. Myopic retinopathy was defined to include signs of staphyloma, lacquer cracks, Fuchs spot, and myopic chorioretinal atrophy. Results: Of the 6830 participants, 6603 (96.7%) had gradable photographs in at least 1 eye for assessment of myopic retinopathy. The mean (SD) age was 51.9 (11.8) years. Myopic retinopathy was observed in 60 participants (84 eyes), a person-specific prevalence of 0.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.7%-1.1%). Twenty-four (40.0%) had bilateral disease. Higher myopic retinopathy prevalencewas associated with older age (P<.001) and increasing myopic spherical equivalent refractive error (P<.001). Mean (SD) spherical equivalent refraction was -12.3 (6.1) diopters for eyes with myopic retinopathy compared with -1.6 (1.6) diopters in myopic eyes without myopic retinopathy (P<.001). Bilateral blindness or low vision as defined by best-corrected visual acuity was present in 14 participants (24.6%) with myopic retinopathy. Staphyloma was the most frequent myopic retinopathy sign (86.9%), followed by chorioretinal atrophy (56.0%), lacquer cracks (36.9%), and Fuchs spot (14.3%). Conclusions: Myopic retinopathy was detected in 0.9% of rural Chinese individuals 30 years or older. The prevalence of myopic retinopathy was lower than that in the Beijing Eye Study but was similar to white individuals of similar age in the Australian Blue Mountains Eye Study. ©2011 American Medical Association.

80053263994	Single versus sequential testing with scanning peripheral anterior chamber depth analyser, IOLMaster and anterior segment optical coherence tomography for the detection of narrow angles	Background: Scanning peripheral anterior chamber depth analyser (SPAC), IOLMaster and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) are devices that can screen non-invasively for narrow angles (NAs) and may reduce the need for gonioscopy, especially where the availability of ophthalmologists is limited. When used individually to detect NAs, neither SPAC, AS-OCT nor IOLMaster were able to achieve both high sensitivity and specificity when using gonioscopy as a gold standard. Aims: To assess whether sequential testing improves discrimination of NAs over single testing. Methods: In a prospective community-based cross-sectional study in Singapore, 2047 phakic right eyes underwent SPAC, IOLMaster and AS-OCT. NA eyes were defined as present when Shaffer scores were 0 or 1 in ≥2 quadrants on gonioscopy. Sensitivities and specificities of single and sequential testing were compared. Results: At a fixed specificity of 95%, sensitivities in detecting NA eyes were 57.8% (95% CI 52.7% to 62.7%) for SPAC, 43.3% (95% CI 38.3% to 48.3%) for IOLMaster and 52.1% (95% CI 46.4% to 57.7%) for AS-OCT. After sequential testing using SPAC followed by AS-OCT, the sensitivity rose to 70.3% (95% CI 65.5% to 74.8%) while specificity remained at 94.3% (95% CI 93.1% to 95.4%), with sensitivity significantly higher than single testing alone (p<0.001). Conclusion: Sequential testing significantly improves the accuracy of detecting NAs and may be useful in screening settings.

80053634424	A population-based assessment of 24-hour intraocular pressure among subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma: The Handan eye study	Purpose. To describe the distribution of the 24-hour intraocular pressure (IOP) among subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in a population-based study in north China. Methods. All untreated POAG patients (n = 66) identified in the Handan Eye Study were invited to attend a follow-up study in which IOP was tested with a Goldmann applanation tonometer at 10 AM, 2 PM, 6 PM, 10 PM, 2 AM, and 6 AM. Results. Forty-seven subjects with untreated POAG (47/66; 71.2%) attended the study. Of them, 39 (83.0%) had a peak IOP ≤ 21 mm Hg. The peak IOP (mean ± SD) was 18.4 ± 37 mm Hg. Peak IOP occurred in early morning in approximately 76.5% of the subjects (6 AM to 10 AM), and the trough occurred during night time in 70.2% of the subjects (10 PM to 2 AM). The 24-hour IOP (mean ± SD) was 15.4 ± 3.1 mm Hg and the mean fluctuation was 6.0 ± 2.2 mm Hg (range, 2-11 mm Hg). In the 22 persons with unilateral glaucoma, no significant differences were found in mean 24-hour IOP, peak IOP, trough IOP, or IOP fluctuation when comparing the glaucomatous eye with the nonglaucomatous eye (P > 0.05). Conclusions. About 80% of Chinese persons with POAG identified in a population-based study had maximum IOPs of 21 mm Hg or less over a 24-hour period. Twenty-four-hour IOP was similar between glaucomatous and contralateral nonglaucomatous eyes suggesting that factors other than IOP may play a role in the development of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in these eyes. © 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

84855380696	Prevalence and characteristics of primary angle-closure diseases in a rural adult Chinese population: The Handan eye study	Purpose. To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of primary angle-closure suspect (PACS), primary angle closure (PAC), and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) in a rural population in China. Methods. In all, 6716 Han Chinese 30 years of age and older (5480 subjects 40 years of age and older) from 13 villages in Handan were randomly selected and completed an ophthalmologic examination, including visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), slit-lamp examination, gonioscopy and stereoscopic photography, and visual field. PACS was defined as present if either eye had the posterior trabecular meshwork not visible for 180° or more on gonioscopy. PAC was present in an eye with PACS and peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) and/or IOP ≥ 21 mm Hg, but without glaucomatous neuropathy (GON). PACG was defined as PAC with evidence of GON. Results. The standardized prevalences of PACG, PAC, and PACS were 0.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3-0.7%), 1.5% (95% CI: 1.2-1.8%), and 10.4% (95% CI: 9.6-11.2%) in those 40 years of age and older. The prevalence of all three conditions increased with age (P < 0.001). Females had much higher rates of PACS, PAC, and PACG (P < 0.05); 21 persons with PACG (65%) were blind in at least one eye: 13 were due to glaucoma and the other 8 likely had other causes. Conclusions. The prevalence of PACS, PAC, and PACG in this rural population is similar to what was previously reported in urban Chinese residents. Two thirds of those with PACG were blind in at least one eye. Strategies to detect and treat this preventable disease in rural China are needed. © 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

84856515381	Immediate changes in intraocular pressure after laser peripheral iridotomy in primary angle-closure suspects	Purpose: To determine the immediate changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) after laser peripheral iridotomy in primary angle-closure suspects. Design: Prospective, randomized controlled trial (split-body design). Participants: Seven hundred thirty-four Chinese people 50 to 70 years of age. Methods: Primary angle-closure suspects underwent iridotomy using a neodymium: yttriumaluminumgarnet laser in 1 randomly selected eye, with the fellow eye serving as a control. Intraocular pressure was measured using Goldmann applanation tonometry before treatment and 1 hour and 2 weeks after treatment. Total energy used and complications were recorded. Risk factors for IOP rise after laser peripheral iridotomy were investigated. Main Outcome Measures: Intraocular pressure. Results: The proportion of treated eyes with an IOP spike (an elevation of <8 mmHg more than baseline) at 1 hour and 2 weeks after treatment was 9.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.712.0) and 0.82% (95% CI, 0.21.5), respectively. Only 4 (0.54%) of 734 eyes (95% CI, 0.011.08) had an immediate posttreatment IOP of 30 mmHg or more and needed medical intervention. The average IOP 1 hour after treatment was 17.5±4.7 mmHg in the treated eyes, as compared with 15.2±2.6 mmHg in controls. At 2 weeks after treatment, these values were 15.6±3.4 mmHg in treated eyes and 15.1±2.7 mmHg in controls (P<0.001). No significant difference was detected in the baseline IOP of the treated and untreated eyes. Logistic regression showed that the incidence of IOP spike was associated with greater laser energy used and shallower central anterior chamber. Conclusions: Laser peripheral iridotomy in primary angle-closure suspects resulted in significant IOP rise in 9.8% and 0.82% of cases at 1 hour and 2 weeks, respectively. Eyes in which more laser energy and a higher number of laser pulses were used and those with shallower central anterior chambers were at increased risk for IOP spikes at 1 hour after laser peripheral iridotomy.

84856533763	Determinants of angle width in Chinese Singaporeans	Purpose: To investigate determinants of angle width and derive mathematic models to best predict angle width. Design: Population-based, cross-sectional study. Participants: A total of 1067 Chinese subjects aged <40 years. Methods: Participants underwent gonioscopy, A-scan biometry, and imaging by anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Customized software (Zhongshan Angle Assessment Program, Guangzhou, China) was used to measure ASOCT parameters. Linear regression modeling was performed with trabeculariris space area at 750 μm (TISA750) and angle opening distance at 750 μm (AOD750) from the scleral spur as the 2 dependent angle width variables. By using a combination of ASOCT and biometric parameters, an optimal model that was predictive of angle width was determined by a forward selection regression algorithm. Validation of the results was performed in a separate set of community-based clinic study of 1293 persons aged <50 years. Main Outcome Measures: Angle width and biometric parameters. Results: The mean age (standard deviation) of the population-based subjects was 56.9 (8.5) years, and 50.2% were male. For TISA750, the strongest determinants among ASOCT and A-scan independent variables were anterior chamber volume (ACV, R

84860870433	A study of initial therapy for glaucoma in Southern India: India glaucoma uutcomes and treatment (INGOT) study	Purpose: To compare initial glaucoma therapy with medications and trabeculectomy in southern India. Methods: Patients aged ≥30 years newly diagnosed with glaucoma were randomized to trabeculectomy with 5-fluorouracil or medical therapy. Subjects with best-corrected vision <6/18 due to cataract underwent phacoemulsification (phaco/intraocular lens, IOL). Intraocular pressure (IOP), vision and visual function were assessed at 12 months. Results: Patients assigned to medications and surgery received the expected therapy in 86% (172/199) and 64% (126/199) of cases, respectively. Forty patients (20%) assigned to surgery refused any treatment and 33 (17%) received medications. Among 199 patients randomized to medications, 52 (26.1%) underwent phaco/IOL, as did 89/199 (43.7%) of patients randomized to trabeculectomy. Baseline parameters of the two groups did not differ, nor did 1-year follow-up rates (medication 65%, trabeculectomy 58%, P = 0.15). Final IOP was lower with randomization to trabeculectomy (16.3±5.1 mmHg) than medication (18.8±6.7 mmHg, P < 0.0001). In regression models, randomization to trabeculectomy (P < 0.0001) was associated with lower IOP, and simultaneous trabeculectomy and cataract surgery was associated with higher IOP (P = 0.008) than trabeculectomy alone. Subjects receiving Phaco/IOL had significantly better final acuity (P < 0.0001) and visual function (P = 0.035), despite concurrent glaucoma treatment. Final visual acuity was worse in those receiving trabeculectomy in addition to cataract surgery, but this was of borderline significance (P 0.06). Conclusions: Trabeculectomy lowered IOP significantly more than medical treatment, but with slightly greater loss of visual acuity. Combined phaco/IOL and trabeculectomy improved visual acuity with substantial IOP lowering. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

84862544562	Angle closure and angle-closure glaucoma: What we are doing now and what we will be doing in the future	Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) frequently leads to severe vision loss. Prevalence among older Asian populations is high and given global demographics, the number of persons with PACG will increase dramatically in the coming decades. Improvements in imaging of the anterior segment will help us to identify more of those with angle closure, and important clinical trials that are currently underway will provide important evidence to support screening and treatment approaches for PACG. In this manuscript, we intend to review the existing evidences, to introduce some important on-going studies on PACG and to share the experience and viewpoints of the authors. © 2012 The Authors.

84862764693	Determinants of lens vault and association with narrow angles in patients from Singapore	• PURPOSE: To describe the distribution and determinants of lens vault and to investigate the association of lens vault with narrow angles. • DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. • METHODS: Phakic subjects 50 years and older were evaluated at a primary healthcare clinic with gonioscopy, partial laser interferometry, and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). Narrow angles were defined as posterior trabecular meshwork not visible for <2 quadrants on non-indentation gonioscopy. Lens vault was defined as the perpendicular distance between the anterior pole of the crystalline lens and the horizontal line joining the 2 scleral spurs on horizontal AS-OCT scans. Analysis of covariance, multivariate logistic regression, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were performed. • RESULTS: Of the 2047 subjects recruited, 582 were excluded because of poor image quality or inability to locate scleral spurs, leaving 1465 subjects for analysis. Eyes with narrow angles had greater lens vault compared to eyes with open angles (775.6 μm vs 386.5 μm, P < .0001). Women had significantly greater lens vault than men (497.28 μm vs 438.56 μm, P < .001), and lens vault increased significantly with age (P for trend <.001). Adjusted for age and sex, significant associations with greater lens vault were shorter axial length, shallower anterior chamber depth(ACD), higher intraocular pressure, and more hyperopic spherical equivalent (all P < .001). On multivariate analysis, subjects with lens vault >667.6 μm were more likely to have narrow angles (OR 2.201, 95% CI: 1.070-4.526) compared to those with lens vault ≤462.7 μm. The AUC for lens vault (0.816) and ACD (0.822) for detecting narrow angles were similar (P = .582). • CONCLUSIONS: Lens vault was independently associated with narrow angles and may be useful in screening to detect eyes with narrow angles. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84862951239	Comparing approaches to screening for angle closure in older Chinese adults	AimsPrimary angle-closure glaucoma is expected to account for nearly 50% of bilateral glaucoma blindness by 2020. This study was conducted to assess the performance of the scanning peripheral anterior chamber depth analyzer (SPAC) and limbal anterior chamber depth (LACD) as screening methods for angle closure.MethodsThis study assessed two clinical populations to compare SPAC, LACD, and gonioscopy: the Zhongshan Angle-closure Prevention Trial, from which 370 patients were eligible as closed-angle participants and the Liwan Eye Study, from which 72 patients were selected as open-angle controls. Eligible participants were assessed by SPAC, LACD, and gonioscopy.ResultsAngle status was defined by gonioscopy. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for SPAC was 0.92 (0.89-0.95) whereas AUROC for LACD was 0.94 (0.92-0.97). Using conventional cutoff points, sensitivity/specificity was 93.0%/70.8% for SPAC and 94.1%/87.5% for LACD. Sequential testing using both SPAC and LACD increased the specificity to 94.4% and decreased the sensitivity to 87.0%.ConclusionSPAC has significantly lower specificity than LACD measurement using conventional cutoffs but interpretation of the findings can be performed by modestly trained personnel. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights.

84863328137	Visual symptoms and retinal straylight after laser peripheral iridotomy: The zhongshan angle-closure prevention trial	Objective: To assess the impact of laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) on forward-scatter of light and subjective visual symptoms and to identify LPI parameters influencing these phenomena. Design: Cohort study derived from a randomized trial, using an external control group. Participants: Chinese subjects initially aged 50 or older and 70 years or younger with bilateral narrow angles undergoing LPI in 1 eye selected at random, and age- and gender-matched controls. Methods: Eighteen months after laser, LPI-treated subjects underwent digital iris photography and photogrammetry to characterize the size and location of the LPI, Lens Opacity Classification System III cataract grading, and measurement of retinal straylight (C-Quant; OCULUS, Wetzlar, Germany) in the treated and untreated eyes and completed a visual symptoms questionnaire. Controls answered the questionnaire and underwent straylight measurement and (in a random one-sixth sample) cataract grading. Main Outcome Measures: Retinal straylight levels and subjective visual symptoms. Results: Among 230 LPI-treated subjects (121 [58.8%] with LPI totally covered by the lid, 43 [19.8%] with LPI partly covered by the lid, 53 [24.4%] with LPI uncovered by the lid), 217 (94.3%) completed all testing, as did 250 (93.3%) of 268 controls. Age, gender, and prevalence of visual symptoms did not differ between treated subjects and controls, although nuclear (P<0.01) and cortical (P = 0.03) cataract were less common among controls. Neither presenting visual acuity nor straylight score differed between the treated and untreated eyes among all treated persons, nor among those (n = 96) with LPI partially or totally uncovered. Prevalence of subjective glare did not differ significantly between participants with totally covered LPI (6.61%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.39%-12.5%), partially covered LPI (11.6%; 95% CI, 5.07%-24.5%), or totally uncovered LPI (9.43%; 95% CI, 4.10%-10.3%). In regression models, only worse cortical cataract grade (P = 0.01) was associated significantly with straylight score, and no predictors were associated with subjective glare. None of the LPI size or location parameters were associated with straylight or subjective symptoms. Conclusions: These results suggests that LPI is safe regarding measures of straylight and visual symptoms. This randomized design provides strong evidence that treatment programs for narrow angles would be unlikely to result in important medium-term visual disability.

84863333349	Changes in anterior segment morphology after laser peripheral iridotomy: An anterior segment optical coherence tomography study	Purpose: Novel anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) parameters associated with angle closure include anterior chamber area (ACA), anterior chamber volume (ACV), anterior chamber width (ACW), lens vault (LV), iris thickness (IT), iris area (I-area), and iris curvature (I-curv). We aimed to investigate changes in these parameters after laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) in a cohort of primary angle-closure suspects (PACS). Design: Prospective observational study. Participants and Controls: A total of 176 PACS aged <50 years who underwent LPI in 1 eye. Methods: We analyzed ASOCT images (Visante, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) from all subjects using customized software before and 1 week after LPI. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed for predictors of percentage change in mean angle opening distance (AOD750). Main Outcome Measures: Change in ASOCT parameters after LPI. Results: The mean age of participants was 63±7.3 years. The majority of subjects were Chinese (95.5%) and women (76.7%). Mean angle width (modified Shaffer grade) changed from 0.68±0.54 at baseline to 1.76±0.69 after LPI (P<0.001) with a corresponding increase in mean AOD500 (0.12 vs. 0.19 mm, P<0.001), trabecular iris surface area (TISA500, 0.06 vs. 0.08 mm

84863706289	Prevalence of primary open angle glaucoma in a rural adult chinese population: The Handan eye study	Purpose. To estimate the prevalence and associations of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) in a rural population of northern China. Methods. In a rural county in Handan, China, 6716 adults residing in 13 villages were randomly selected and participated in the study. All participants completed a comprehensive eye examination, including intraocular pressure (IOP), slit-lamp examination, and fundus evaluation. Visual fields were obtained with on glaucoma suspects. Results. Sixty-five persons (1.2%) had POAG, with an adjusted prevalence of 1.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7% -1.3%) in those aged 40 years and older. Sex was not significantly associated with POAG (P > 0.05). Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.5, for each 10-year increase), IOP (OR, 1.5; 95% CI 1.2-2.0 for each 5-mm Hg increase), axial length (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6), and moderate myopia (3.1-6.0 D; OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.6-13.5) increased the risk for POAG in multivariate analysis. The mean IOP of persons with POAG was 16.3 ± 3.5 mm Hg, and 90% of them presented with an IOP ≤21 mm Hg. Of those with POAG, 4.5% were blind from glaucoma in at least one eye. Conclusions. Approximately 1% of adults aged 40 years and older living in rural China have POAG. As seen in other populations, increasing age, higher IOP, greater axial length, and having myopia were associated with POAG. Given the rapid aging and myopic shift (acquired myopia) in China's population, POAG is likely to increase in prevalence in the coming decades. © 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

84866397299	Intraocular pressure and its relationship to ocular and systemic factors in a healthy chinese rural population: The Handan Eye Study	Purpose: To describe the distribution of and factors related to intraocular pressure (IOP) in a healthy adult rural Chinese population in northern China. Methods: The Handan Eye Study is a cross-sectional, population-based study of eye diseases among 6,830 (90.4% response rate) rural Chinese persons aged 30+ years. Participants underwent an interviewer-administered questionnaire and a complete ocular examination, including standardized measurement of IOP with Perkins applanation tonometry. Results: After excluding persons with glaucoma, or those with diseases that have a marked effect on IOP or that preclude accurate IOP measurement, 6,101 persons were included in the current analysis. Mean IOP (mean ± standard deviation) of the study population was 15.0 ± 2.8 mmHg. Men had lower IOP than women (14.6 ± 2.8 mmHg versus 15.4 ± 2.7 mmHg, t = -8.37, P<0.001). In the multivariate analysis younger age, female sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, higher blood pressure, higher body mass index, thicker central cornea and higher myopia were associated with higher IOP. Conclusions: Mean IOP among persons living in rural northern China was similar to that recently reported in southern China. IOP appeared to be lower with increasing age in Chinese subjects, which contrasts with results in white populations. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

84867905183	A randomized, controlled trial of an intervention promoting cataract surgery acceptance in Rural China: The Guangzhou uptake of surgery trial (GUSTO)	PURPOSE. To evaluate an educational intervention promoting acceptance of cataract surgery in rural China using a randomized controlled design. METHODS. Patients aged 50 years or older with presenting visual acuity (PVA) less than 6/18 in one or both eyes due to cataract were recruited from 26 screening sessions (13 intervention, 13 control) conducted by five rural hospitals in Guangdong, China. At intervention sessions, subjects were shown a 5- minute informational video, and counseled about cataract, surgery, and surgical cost. During screening, all subjects answered questionnaires on knowledge and attitudes about cataract, their finances, and transportation, and were referred for definitive examination if eligible. Study outcomes were acceptance of surgery (principal outcome) and hospital followup. RESULTS. Subjects in the intervention group were younger than controls (P = 0.01), but the groups did not otherwise differ. Among 212 intervention patients and 222 controls, no differences in knowledge and attitude regarding cataract were found. Surgery was accepted by 31.1% of intervention patients and 34.2% of controls (P > 0.50). Predictors of acceptance included younger age, worse logMAR PVA, knowing that cataract can be treated surgically only, greater anticipated loss in income from hospitalization, and greater house floor space per person. Membership in the intervention group was not associated with accepting surgery (odds ratio [OR]=1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-1.84) or hospital follow-up (OR= 1.03, 95% CI = 0.63-1.67). CONCLUSIONS. Educational interventions that successfully impart the knowledge that cataract can be only treated surgically may be more effective in increasing uptake in this setting. © 2012 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

84872045754	Classification algorithms based on anterior segment optical coherence tomography measurements for detection of angle closure	Objective: A recent study found that a combination of 6 anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) parameters (anterior chamber area, volume, and width [ACA, ACV, ACW], lens vault [LV], iris thickness at 750 μm from the scleral spur, and iris cross-sectional area) explain >80% of the variability in angle width. The aim of this study was to evaluate classification algorithms based on ASOCT measurements for the detection of gonioscopic angle closure. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: We included 2047 subjects aged ≥50 years. Methods: Participants underwent gonioscopy and ASOCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Customized software (Zhongshan Angle Assessment Program, Guangzhou, China) was used to measure ASOCT parameters in horizontal ASOCT scans. Six classification algorithms were considered (stepwise logistic regression with Akaike information criterion, Random Forest, multivariate adaptive regression splines, support vector machine, naïve Bayes' classification, and recursive partitioning). The ASOCT-derived parameters were incorporated to generate point and interval estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curves for these algorithms using 10-fold cross-validation as well as 50:50 training and validation. Main Outcome Measures: We assessed ASOCT measurements and angle closure. Results: Data on 1368 subjects, including 295 (21.6%) subjects with gonioscopic angle closure were available for analysis. The mean (± standard deviation) age was 62.4±7.5 years and 54.8% were females. Angle closure subjects were older and had smaller ACW, ACA, and ACV; greater LV; and thicker irides (P<0.001 for all). For both, the 10-fold cross-validation and the 50:50 training and validation methods, stepwise logistic regression was the best algorithm for detecting eyes with gonioscopic angle closure with testing set AUC of 0.954 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.942-0.966) and 0.962 (95% CI, 0.948-0.975) respectively, whereas recursive partitioning had relatively the poorest performance with testing set AUC 0.860 (95% CI, 0.790-0.930) and 0.905 (95% CI, 0.876-0.933), respectively. This algorithm performed similarly well (AUC, 0.957) in a second independent sample of 200 angle closure subjects and 302 normal controls. Conclusions: A classification algorithm based on stepwise logistic regression that used a combination of 6 parameters obtained from a single horizontal ASOCT scan identified subjects with gonioscopic angle closure >95% of the time.

84872290332	Prevalence and associations of cataract in a rural Chinese adult population: The Handan Eye Study	Background: Cataract remains the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment in the world and in China. However, data on the prevalence of cataract based on standardized lens grading protocols from mainland China are limited. This paper estimated the age- and gender-specific prevalence and risk factor for cataract Methods: In a population-based Chinese sample, participants underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination, including assessment of cortical, nuclear, posterior subcapsular (PSC) and mixed lens opacities from slit-lamp grading using the Lens Opacities Classification System III. Results: Of the 7,557 eligible subjects, 6,830 took part in the study (90.4 % response rate), and 6,544 participants (95.8 %, mean age 52.0 ± 11.8 years) had lens data for analyses. The prevalence of any cataract surgery in at least one eye was 0.8 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.62, 1.06), with similar rates between men and women. The overall prevalence of any cataract or cataract surgery was 20.8 % (95 % CI, 19.8, 21.8), higher in women than in men after adjusting for age (23.6 % vs 17.6 %; OR: 1.78; 95 % CI: 1.54-2.07). When distinct lens opacity was categorized in each eye as cortical, nuclear, PSC or mixed, based on one randomly selected eye, cortical cataract was the most common distinct subtype (12.3 %), followed by mixed (3.2 %), nuclear (1.7 %), and PSC (0.2 %) cataract. The prevalence of all lens opacities increased with age (P < 0.001). After excluding other causes for visual impairment, the proportion of people with best corrected visual acuity <20/60 was 21 % among those with PSC, and 12 % among those with mixed opacities in the better-seeing eye. In multivariable logistic regression models, myopia was associated with all cataract types, while higher fasting plasma glucose and diabetes were only associated with PSC cataract. Conclusions: Cataract affects 20 % of the population aged 30 years and older living in rural China, with cortical cataract the most common subtype. Risk factors for cataract include myopia and diabetes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84872291644	Analysis of anterior segment dynamics using anterior segment optical coherence tomography before and after laser peripheral iridotomy	Objective: To evaluate changes in the speed of pupil constriction and in anterior segment parameters after laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) in patients with angle closure using anterior segment optical coherence tomography. Methods: In this prospective observational study, videos of pupil and anterior segment changes in response to illumination were captured with real-time video recording using anterior segment optical coherence tomography and were analyzed frame by frame before and after LPI. Customized software was used to measure the speed of pupil constriction and changes in anterior chamber depth and anterior chamber area, as well as iris thickness at 750 μm from the scleral spur, at the sphincter muscle region (0.75mm from the pupillary margin), and at the mid-iris location (half the distance between the scleral spur and the pupillary margin). Pupil diameter, angle opening distance, and trabecular-iris space area at 500 μm from the scleral spur were determined. The speed of pupil constriction was defined as the rate of pupil diameter change in response to illumination. Results: Twenty-nine patients were included. Most were Chinese (26 of 29 [90%]) and female (18 of 29 [62%]). The anterior chamber area, angle opening distance at 500 μm from the scleral spur, and trabecular-iris space area at 500 μm from the scleral spur were significantly higher after LPI (P < .001). A significant increase was observed in the speed of pupil constriction after LPI (P < .005). In response to illumination, the rate of change in iris thickness at the sphincter muscle region and at 750 μm from the scleral spur was faster after LPI (P < .05). Similarly, an increase was observed in the speed of change of angle-opening distance at 500 μm from the scleral spur in response to illumination after LPI (P < .05). Conclusions: In patients with angle closure, changes in dynamic iridopupillary behavior are observed after LPI. The speed of pupillary constriction is faster after LPI. ©2013 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

84874681825	Visual outcomes of cataract surgery performed by supervised novice surgeons during training in rural China	To assess the outcomes of cataract surgery performed by novice surgeons during training in a rural programme. Design: Retrospective study. Participants: Three hundred thirty-four patients operated by two trainees under supervision at rural Chinese county hospitals. Methods: Two trainees performed surgeries under supervision. Visual acuity, refraction and examinations were carried out 3 months postoperatively. Main Outcome Measures: Postoperative uncorrected visual acuity, pinhole visual acuity, causes of visual impairment (postoperative uncorrected visual acuity<6/18) Results: Among 518 operated patients, 426 (82.2%) could be contacted and 334 (64.4% of operated patients) completed the examinations. The mean age was 74.1±8.8 years and 62.9% were women. Postoperative uncorrected visual acuity was available in 372 eyes. Among them, uncorrected visual acuity was ≥6/18 in 278 eyes (74.7%) and <6/60 in 60 eyes (16.1%), and 323 eyes (86.8%) had pinhole visual acuity≥6/18 and 38 eyes (10.2%) had pinhole visual acuity<6/60. Main causes of visual impairment were uncorrected refractive error (63.9%) and comorbid eye disease (24.5%). Comorbid eye diseases associated with pinhole visual acuity<6/60 (n=23, 6.2%) included glaucoma, other optic nerve atrophy, vitreous haemorrhage and retinal detachment. Conclusions: The findings suggest that hands-on training remains safe and effective even when not implemented in centralized training centres. Further refinement of the training protocol, providing postoperative refractive services and more accurate preoperative intraocular lens calculations, can help optimize outcomes. © 2012 The Authors Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology © 2012 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists.

84874704364	Factors influencing the success of rural cataract surgery programs in China: The study of hospital administration and relative productivity (SHARP)	PURPOSE. To explore factors potentially influencing the success or failure of rural Chinese hospitals in increasing cataract surgical output and quality. METHODS. Focus groups (FGs, n = 10) were conducted with hospital administrators, doctors, and nurses at 28 county hospitals in Guangdong Province. Discussions explored respondents' views on increasing surgical volume and quality and improving patient satisfaction. Respondents numerically ranked possible strategies to increase surgical volume and quality and patient satisfaction. FG transcripts were independently coded by two reviewers utilizing the constant comparative method following the grounded theory approach, and numerical responses were scored and ranked. RESULTS. Ten FGs and 77 ranking questionnaires were completed by 33 administrators, 23 doctors, and 21 nurses. Kappa values for the two coders were greater than 0.7 for all three groups. All groups identified a critical need for enhanced management training for hospital directors. Doctors and nurses suggested reducing surgical fees to enhance uptake, although administrators were resistant to this. Although doctors saw the need to improve equipment, administrators felt current material conditions were adequate. Respondents agreed that patient satisfaction was generally high, and did not view increasing patient satisfaction as a priority. CONCLUSIONS. Our findings highlight agreements and disagreements among the three stakeholder groups about improving surgical output and quality, which can inform strategies to improve cataract programs in rural China. Respondents' beliefs about high patient satisfaction are not in accord with other studies in the area, highlighting a potential area for intervention. © 2013 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

84874742339	Variations in iris volume with physiologic mydriasis in subtypes of primary angle closure glaucoma	PURPOSE. To compare the changes in iris volume with pupil dilation using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) in eyes of subjects with different subtypes of primary angle closure. METHODS. This prospective study examined 44 fellow eyes (FA group) of subjects with previous acute primary angle closure (APAC), and 56 subjects (AC group) with chronic primary angle closure and/or primary angle closure glaucoma. All participants underwent gonioscopy and AS-OCT imaging. The iris volume, iris cross-sectional area, and pupil diameter were measured with custom semiautomated software. The main outcome variable analyzed was mean change in iris volume between light and dark conditions in a multivariate linear regression analysis. RESULTS. Thirty-five eyes from the FA group (79.5%) and 50 eyes from the AC group (89.3%) were included in the final analysis. When going from light to dark, iris volume did not change significantly in eyes in the FA group (+1.50 6 6.73 mm

84878702880	Assessment of trabecular meshwork width using swept source optical coherence tomography	Purpose: Measurements of the angle width by ultrasound biomicroscopy or anterior segment optical coherence tomography are usually performed 500 μm from the scleral spur, as the anterior part of trabecular meshwork (TM) is assumed to lie within this distance. The aim of this study was to measure TM width using swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT, CASIA SS-1000, Tomey Corporation, Nagoya, Japan), and to investigate factors influencing this measurement. Methods: Participants underwent gonioscopy and SS-OCT imaging in the dark. High-definition SS-OCT images were corrected for refractive distortion; and customized software (ImageJ; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) was utilized to measure TM width (distance between the scleral spur and Schwalbe's line). Linear regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between TM width with demographic and angle parameters. Results: One hundred and forty eight Chinese subjects were analyzed. The majority was female (62.4 %); the mean age was 59.2 ± 8.68 years. Identification of the scleral spur and Schwalbe's line with SS-OCT was possible in 590 (99.7 %) and 585 angle quadrants (98.8 %) respectively. TM width was wider in the inferior and superior quadrants (mean 889 [SD 138] and 793 [136] μm), compared to the nasal and temporal quadrants (712 [137] and 724 [115] μm, P < 0.001). There was a difference in average TM width between open (789 [100]) and closed angle eyes (753 [86]) (P = 0.048). There was no significant association between TM width and angle parameters, laterality, or demographic factors. Conclusions: In SS-OCT HD images, the mean TM width varied from 710 to 890 μm in the different quadrants of the eye, and the inferior quadrant TM was the widest compared to other quadrants. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84878465648	The prevalence of and risk factors associated with pterygium in a rural adult chinese population: The Handan eye study	Purpose: To describe the prevalence and risk factors for pterygium in a rural adult Chinese population. Methods: A total of 7557 people aged 30 years and over were randomly selected from 13 villages in a rural county, Yongnian, within Handan district, Hebei Province of China. All eligible subjects were invited to undergo a comprehensive eye examination. A slit-lamp was used to examine the anterior segment for evidence of pterygium. Pterygium was graded for severity (G1 to G3) by visibility of episcleral vessels. Results: Of 6685 participants (88.5% of 7557) included in this study, pterygium was present in 401 (6.0%). Using direct standardization to the 2000 China population census for rural residents, the prevalence of pterygium was 7.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.5-7.8%) among subjects aged 40+ years, and 4.8% (95% CI 4.3-5.3%) when including those aged 30-39 years. Pterygium was more common in men than in women (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-2.8). Prevalence increased with age (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.6-2.1 per decade increase in age). Current smoking appeared to be protective (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.7). Of eyes with any pterygium, 4.6% (95% CI 1.9-7.3%) had low vision. Conclusion: Approximately one in ten adults had pterygium in this rural Chinese population. Age and male sex were positively, and current smoking negatively associated with the prevalence of pterygium. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

84884975067	Perceived difficulty of various steps of manual small incision cataract surgery among trainees in rural China	Background: The perceived difficulty of steps of manual small incision cataract surgery among trainees in rural China was assessed. Design: Cohort study. Participants: Fifty-two trainees at the end of a manual small incision cataract surgery training programme. Methods: Participants rated the difficulty of 14 surgical steps using a 5-point scale, 1 (very easy) to 5 (very difficult). Demographic and professional information was recorded for trainees. Main Outcome Measure: Mean ratings for surgical steps. Results: Questionnaires were completed by 49 trainees (94.2%, median age 38 years, 8 [16.3%] women). Twenty six (53.1%) had performed ≤50 independent cataract surgeries prior to training. Trainees rated cortical aspiration (mean score±standard deviation=3.10±1.14) the most difficult step, followed by wound construction (2.76±1.08), nuclear prolapse into the anterior chamber (2.74±1.23) and lens delivery (2.51±1.08). Draping the surgical field (1.06±0.242), anaesthetic block administration (1.14±0.354) and thermal coagulation (1.18±0.441) were rated easiest. In regression models, the score for cortical aspiration was significantly inversely associated with performing >50 independent manual small incision cataract surgery surgeries during training (P=0.01), but not with age, gender, years of experience in an eye department or total number of cataract surgeries performed prior to training. Conclusions: Cortical aspiration, wound construction and nuclear prolapse pose the greatest challenge for trainees learning manual small incision cataract surgery, and should receive emphasis during training. Number of cases performed is the strongest predictor of perceived difficulty of key steps. © 2013 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists.

84884992299	Eye care use among rural adults in China: The Handan Eye study	Purpose: To assess the use of eye care services in a rural population in North China and to analyze the factors associated with underuse of these services. Methods: In a cross-sectional population-based study, demographic, health and vision-related information including use of eye care services were determined during a face-to-face interview. A single visit to an eye care provider qualified as "use" of eye care services. Results: Of 6612 participants, 754 (11.4%, 95% confidence interval, CI, 8.7-14.1%) had used eye care services. The most common reason cited for not seeing an eye care provider was "no need" (n=5754). Of the 5754 who thought that there was no need to see an ophthalmologist, 3458 (60.1%) were found to have one or more type of eye disease, including glaucoma (56, 1.0%), cataract (1056, 18.4%), age-related macular degeneration (AMD; 164, 2.9%) and refractive error (3048, 53.0%). Also, 74 (1.3%) and 409 (7.1%) of the 5754 participants had visual impairment (<20/60) according to best-corrected visual acuity and presenting visual acuity, respectively. In a multiple regression model, participants who had glaucoma (adjusted odds ratio, OR, 4.0, 95% CI 3.0-5.4), AMD (adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.3) or refractive error (adjusted OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8), were more likely to visit an eye care provider. Conclusion: A high proportion of the Chinese rural population had never used eye care services although three fifths had eye diseases. Further efforts towards better education of the general population about common eye problems as well as increasing the number of ocular health providers would be necessary in future. © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

Design Cross-sectional study. Methods A total of 2047 subjects 50 years of age and older were recruited from a community polyclinic in Singapore. All subjects underwent standardized ocular examination including gonioscopy and imaging by AS OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec). Customized software (Zhongshan Angle Assessment Program) was used to measure AS OCT parameters. Complete data were available for 1368 subjects. Data from the right eyes were used for analysis. A stepwise logistic regression model with Akaike information criterion was used to generate a score that then was converted to an estimated probability of the presence of gonioscopic angle closure, defined as the inability to visualize the posterior trabecular meshwork for at least 180 degrees on nonindentation gonioscopy. Results Of the 1368 subjects, 295 (21.6%) had gonioscopic angle closure. The angle closure score was calculated from the shifted linear combination of the AS OCT parameters. The score can be converted to an estimated probability of having angle closure using the relationship: estimated probability = e

84900843058	Associations between narrow angle and adult anthropometry: The liwan eye study	Purpose: To assess the associations between narrow angle and adult anthropometry. Methods: Chinese adults aged 50 years and older were recruited from a population-based survey in the Liwan District of Guangzhou, China. Narrow angle was defined as the posterior trabecular meshwork not visible under static gonioscopy in at least three quadrants (i.e. a circumference of at least 270°). Logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between narrow angle and anthropomorphic measures (height, weight and body mass index, BMI). Results: Among the 912 participants, lower weight, shorter height, and lower BMI were significantly associated with narrower angle width (tests for trend: mean angle width in degrees vs weight p<0.001; vs height p<0.001; vs BMI p=0.012). In univariate analyses, shorter height, lower weight and lower BMI were all significantly associated with greater odds of narrow angle. The crude association between height and narrow angle was largely attributable to a stronger association with age and sex. Lower BMI and weight remained significantly associated with narrow angle after adjustment for height, age, sex, axial ocular biometric measures and education. In analyses stratified by sex, the association between BMI and narrow angle was only observed in women. Conclusion: Lower BMI and weight were associated with significantly greater odds of narrow angle after adjusting for age, education, axial ocular biometric measures and height. The odds of narrow angle increased 7% per 1 unit decrease in BMI. This association was most evident in women. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

84906940545	Longitudinal changes of angle configuration in primary angle-closure suspects: The Zhongshan angle-closure prevention trial	Objective To determine longitudinal changes in angle configuration in the eyes of primary angle-closure suspects (PACS) treated by laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) and in untreated fellow eyes. Design Longitudinal cohort study. Participants Primary angle-closure suspects aged 50 to 70 years were enrolled in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Methods Each participant was treated by LPI in 1 randomly selected eye, with the fellow eye serving as a control. Angle width was assessed in a masked fashion using gonioscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) before and at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 18 months after LPI. Main Outcome Measures Angle width in degrees was calculated from Shaffer grades assessed under static gonioscopy. Angle configuration was also evaluated using angle opening distance (AOD250, AOD500, AOD750), trabecular-iris space area (TISA500, TISA750), and angle recess area (ARA) measured in AS-OCT images. Results No significant difference was found in baseline measures of angle configuration between treated and untreated eyes. At 2 weeks after LPI, the drainage angle on gonioscopy widened from a mean of 13.5° at baseline to a mean of 25.7° in treated eyes, which was also confirmed by significant increases in all AS-OCT angle width measures (P<0.001 for all variables). Between 2 weeks and 18 months after LPI, a significant decrease in angle width was observed over time in treated eyes (P<0.001 for all variables), although the change over the first 5.5 months was not statistically significant for angle width measured under gonioscopy (P = 0.18), AOD250 (P = 0.167) and ARA (P = 0.83). In untreated eyes, angle width consistently decreased across all follow-up visits after LPI, with a more rapid longitudinal decrease compared with treated eyes (P values for all variables ≤0.003). The annual rate of change in angle width was equivalent to 1.2°/year (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-1.6) in treated eyes and 1.6°/year (95% CI, 1.3-2.0) in untreated eyes (P<0.001). Conclusions Angle width of treated eyes increased markedly after LPI, remained stable for 6 months, and then decreased significantly by 18 months after LPI. Untreated eyes experienced a more consistent and rapid decrease in angle width over the same time period. © 2014 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

84921682483	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies novel loci that influence cupping and the glaucomatous process	Glaucoma is characterized by irreversible optic nerve degeneration and is the most frequent cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Here, the International Glaucoma Genetics Consortium conducts a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of vertical cup-disc ratio (VCDR), an important disease-related optic nerve parameter. In 21,094 individuals of European ancestry and 6,784 individuals of Asian ancestry, we identify 10 new loci associated with variation in VCDR. In a separate risk-score analysis of five case-control studies, Caucasians in the highest quintile have a 2.5-fold increased risk of primary open-angle glaucoma as compared with those in the lowest quintile. This study has more than doubled the known loci associated with optic disc cupping and will allow greater understanding of mechanisms involved in this common blinding condition.
