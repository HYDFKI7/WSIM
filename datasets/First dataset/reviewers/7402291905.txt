22044453204	Three-dimensional interactive virtual endoscopy	Virtual endoscopy is a new development of diagnostic imaging, covering a wide range of potential clinical applications. This paper introduced a system framework for virtual endoscopy. Our research efforts concentrated on mesh smoothing, automated centerline extraction and view-dependent level-of-detail rendering techniques. First, the fairing surface was obtained by smoothing the normal vectors of the reconstructed model. Then, the modified reliable path method was used to generate the accurate skeleton. After that, the view-dependent level-of-detail rendering techniques, including mesh simplification, mesh parameterization and mesh subdivision, were used to achieve the purpose of real time rendering. Experimental results for the images of cerebral blood vessels, knees, and trachea using our solution were given. © 2004 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

26944461587	A new interactive segmentation scheme based on fuzzy affinity and Live-Wire	In this paper we report the combination of the Live-Wire method with the region growing algorithm based on fuzzy affinity. First, we employed anisotropic diffusion filter to process the images which smoothed the images while keeping the edge, and then we confined the possible boundary in applying the Live-Wire method to the over-segmentation found by the region growing algorithm. The speed and the reliability of the segmentation of the Live-Wire method are greatly improved by such combination. This method has been used for CT and MR image segmentation. The results confirmed that our method is practical and accurate in the medical image segmentation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

33751571023	Improved MSEL and its medical application	Edge detection is the basic operation in the image processing and analysis. Multiresolution Sequential Edge Linking (MSEL), which is proposed by Edward J.Delp of Purdue University, has a number of advantages over other edge detection schemes, such as lower false alarm rates while maintaining full connectivity of the edge. However, it is not reasonable in the initial value choosing and time consuming. To this problem, we first use anisotropic diffusion to smooth the image while keeping the edge, and then use the feedback method to optimize the initial value. We apply our method to the medical image, and the experiments show that our method is more efficient and accuracy than the old MSEL. © 2002 IEEE.

84907890408	Time-dependent diffusion tensor changes of optic nerve in patients with indirect traumatic optic neuropathy	Background: Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy (ITON) is a devastating cause of permanent visual loss. Axonal degeneration, the characteristic pathological change of ITON, cannot be assessed by conventional imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been widely used as a sensitive non-invasive imaging technique to obtain information on axonal integrity. Purpose: To study time-dependent changes in ITON patients with DTI and to provide imaging evidence for clinical diagnosis and therapy. Material and Methods: We enrolled 28 subjects with unilateral ITON who underwent detailed ocular examinations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. The differences between injured optic nerve (ON) and contralateral ON were tested. The patients were divided into three groups based on time (from injury to examination). Groups 1, 2, and 3 corresponded to the time taken from injury to examination: <7 days, 7-30 days, and >30 days, respectively. DT magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) differences among the groups were compared, including the relationship between diffusion parameters and mean thicknesses of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell complex (GCC) in the macular area. Results: Compared with contralateral ON, we observed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) of injured nerves in group 2. Reduced FA and decreased axial diffusivity (λ //) and increased radial diffusivity (λ⊥) and mean diffusivity (MD) of injured nerves were observed in group 3. The mean FA value of injured nerves showed a progressive decreasing trend, and mean λ⊥ value exhibited a progressive increasing trend. For injured eyes, the MD and λ⊥ increases strongly correlated with the decreased mean thicknesses of RNFL and GCC. Conversely, FA was significantly associated with mean RNFL thickness. Conclusion: DT-MRI parameters could be useful biomarkers in detecting ON changes in ITON patients.

42749094002	Structural and functional deficits in human amblyopia	Many neuroimaging tools have been used to assess the site of the cortical deficits in human amblyopia. In this paper, we aimed at detecting the structural and functional deficits in humans with amblyopia, with the aid of anatomic magnetic resonance imaging (aMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI). We designed the visual stimulus to investigate the functional deficits, and delineated the V1/V2 areas by retinotopic mapping. Then we performed the brain parcellation to calculate the volume of the subcortical structure on each individual, and reconstructed the cortical surfaces to measure the cortical thickness. At last, the statistical comparison was carried out to find the structural abnormities and their relationship to the functional deficits. Compared with the normal controls, it is found that the hemisphere difference existed on the unilateral amblyopia subjects, and the functional deficit might come along with the changes in the cortical volume, especially in the occipital lobe. The examined results may provide insight to the study of the neural substrates of amblyopia. Crown Copyright © 2008.

51349162698	3D medical imaging computation and analysis platform	Currently in the community of medical imaging computatin and analysis, there exist several excellent toolkits for various tasks. For example, VTK (http://www.vtk.org) is the most famous visualization tool and ITK (http://www.itk.org) plays an important role in the segmentation and registration of medical images. These toolkits can assist the doctors to get the more accurate diagnosis, and help the researchers to get the more powerful capability of medical image processing. However, they are separate and style-various. Even for VTK and ITK, which are designed by the same company, users have to familiarize the two completely different coding styles. In this situation, using all of these toolkits is difficult. In this study, we will introduce 3D medical imaging computation and analysis platform (3DMed), which provides powerful functions such as image preprocessing, virtual cutting, surface rendering, volume rendering, manipulation and vitual endoscopy. The functional module description, system design and the visualization algorithm is demonstrated. The system can be widely applied to processing and analysis of CT and MR images.

71549117101	Segmentation of infarct in acute ischemic stroke from MR apparent diffusion coefficient and trace-weighted images	Evidence from several previous studies indicated that apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map was likely to reveal brain regions belonging to the ischemic penumbra, that is, areas that may be at risk of infarction in a few hours following stroke onset. Trace map overcomes the anisotropic diffusions of ADC map, so it is superior for evaluation of an infarct involving white matter. Mean shift (MS) approach has been successfully used for image segmentation, particularly in brain MR images. The aim of the study was to develop a tool for rapid and reliable segmentation of infarct in human acute ischemic stroke based on the ADC and trace maps using the MS approach. In addition, a novel method of 3-dimensional visualization was presented to provide useful insights into volume datasets for clinical diagnosis. We applied the presented method to clinical data. The results showed that it was consistent, fast (about 8-10 minutes per subject) and indistinguishable from an expert using manual segmentation when used our tool. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

71549133711	Automatic detection of luminal contour in intravascular ultrasound images using fuzzy clustering and snakes	Extraction of the luminal contours from the intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images is very important to analysis and diagnosis of coronary heart disease. Manual processing of large IVUS data is quite tedious and time consuming. This paper presented an algorithm for automatic detection of the luminal contours in intravascular ultrasound images, based on fuzzy clustering and snakes. To solve the difficulty of automatic contour initialization, this paper used fuzzy clustering and spline interpolation to obtain the initial contour. First, fuzzy clustering was used to detect the luminal contours on the multiple longitudinal images. Then, luminal contour points were transformed into the individual transversal images. Those luminal contour points were spline-interpolated on these transversal images. The spline-interpolated contour was used as the initial contour of snakes. We evaluated automatically detection method based on the average contours obtained from expert manual segmentation as the ground truth, and the results had demonstrated that our method was accurate and efficient. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

71549155651	Detection of whole-brain abnormalities in temporal lobe epilepsy using tensor-based morphometry with DARTEL	Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) is an automated technique for detecting the anatomical differences between populations by examining the gradients of the deformation fields used to nonlinearly warp MR images. The purpose of this study was to investigate the whole-brain volume changes between the patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and the controls using TBM with DARTEL, which could achieve more accurate inter-subject registration of brain images. T1-weighted images were acquired from 21 left-TLE patients, 21 right-TLE patients and 21 healthy controls, which were matched in age and gender. The determinants of the gradient of deformation fields at voxel level were obtained to quantify the expansion or contraction for individual images relative to the template, and then logarithmical transformation was applied on it. A whole brain analysis was performed using general lineal model (GLM), and the multiple comparison was corrected by false discovery rate (FDR) with p<0.05. For left-TLE patients, significant volume reductions were found in hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, precentral gyrus, right temporal lobe and cerebellum. These results potentially support the utility of TBM with DARTEL to study the structural changes between groups. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

74049087516	Evaluating neural interaction in motor cortex during reach-to-grasp task from the spike train data	In this work, we recorded the spike train data from a rhesus monkey's motor cortex while it was trained to perform reach-to-grasp task at different directions and orientations. The neurons were divided into several classes according to their neuronal activities, and each class of neuron encoded a kind of functional parameter, such as direction-related, orientationrelated and so on. Then we applied the generalized partial directed coherence (PDC) to evaluate the neural interaction. This method is a frequency domain measure established on the multivariate vector autoregressive model (MVAR). Since MVAR works primarily for continuous data, the spike trains were converted into the time series of the instantaneous firing rate prior to the MVAR estimation. The results indicated that the neural interactions commonly existed among neurons, and there were different network topology and coupling strength of the neural interaction corresponding to different targets. And also, our study still provided the more evidence for the hypothesis that there probably existed a common pathway in motor cortex that controlled both direction and orientation during the reach-tograsp task.

74049143203	Segmentation and tracking of coronary artery using graph-cut in CT angiographic	This paper presents a semiautomatic method to detect the coronary arteries in X-ray CT angiography (CTA) images with simple user interaction. The algorithm is started with performing modified Otsu threshold method and clustering of superpixel to reconstruct the image. The interactive graph cut segmentation and an improved top-hat filter is used to extract the coronary artery in series of two dimension (2D) slice images. Finally, coronary artery tree is tracked with a method based on region average shift. The accuracy of coronary artery extraction has been validated in 16 CTA datasets. The results demonstrate this algorithm has satisfactory speed and efficiency. With more user interaction, the method can be easily extended to the arteries that are not detected automatically. ©2009 IEEE.

77953300621	Regional homogeneity changes in prelingually deafened patients: A resting-state fMRI study	Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique that measures the intrinsic function of brain and has some advantages over task-induced fMRI. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) assesses the similarity of the time series of a given voxel with its nearest neighbors on a voxel-by-voxel basis, which reflects the temporal homogeneity of the regional BOLD signal. In the present study, we used the resting state fMRI data to investigate the ReHo changes of the whole brain in the prelingually deafened patients relative to normal controls. 18 deaf patients and 22 healthy subjects were scanned. Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC) was calculated to measure the degree of regional coherence of fMRI time courses. We found that regional coherence significantly decreased in the left frontal lobe, bilateral temporal lobes and right thalamus, and increased in the postcentral gyrus, cingulate gyrus, left temporal lobe, left thalamus and cerebellum in deaf patients compared with controls. These results show that the prelingually deafened patients have higher degree of regional coherence in the paleocortex, and lower degree in neocortex. Since neocortex plays an important role in the development of auditory, these evidences may suggest that the deaf persons reorganize the paleocortex to offset the loss of auditory. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

77956063771	Gender consistency and difference in healthy adults revealed by cortical thickness	Many previous studies have shown that there exists the gender effect on the structural and functional organization in the human brain. Although the reported functional differences are generally consistent, the structural differences are controversial among the various studies. In this study, we particularly focused on the gender-related effect in the gray matter (GM). We performed a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in 184 healthy adults (90 males and 94 females) with ages ranging from 18 to 70. years. Cortical thickness was measured using an automated surface-based method. Based on this surface morphological feature of GM, we first compared their regional differences between males and females. We then constructed the morphometry-based anatomical networks derived from cortical thickness measurement, while the anatomical connection between two cortical areas depended upon the statistical dependence of their cortical thickness across subjects. Subsequently, we applied graph theoretical approaches to investigate the properties of the resultant anatomical networks. The results showed that the significant gender-related differences of cortical thickness appeared extensively in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. And there were also some between-group differences in the interregional correlation. Additional graph theoretical analysis on the morphological networks revealed both networks exhibited the small-world efficiency and their patterns of topological vulnerability had no statistical differences. The findings on the large sample may provide the evidences to study the gender consistency and difference in the human brain structures. © 2010.

77958085928	Directional diffusivities changes of optic nerve in optic demyelinating neuritis	Objectives To detect and monitor the structural changes of optic nerve caused by idiopathic demyelinating optic neuritis (IDON) by measuring the full diffusion tensor (DT). Design Prospective case-control study. Participants 35 IDON patients and their sex-and age-matched healthy controls. Methods Diffusion tensor imagings of optic nerve were performed by GE signa 1.5T scanner system. Then eddy current distortions and motion artifacts in the DT-MRI data were corrected by applying affine alignment, using FMRIBs diffusion toolbox. The maps of MD, FA and eigenvector were calculated by using DTI Studio. Main Outcome Measures Mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), primary (λ//) and transverse eigenvalue (λ ⊥). Results Compared with healthy controls, acute IDON patients had significant decrease in FA (P=0.001) and significant increase in λ ⊥ (P=0.001). However, chronic IDON had significant increase in MD (P=0.004), λ// (P=0.005) and λ ⊥ (P=0.000) and significant decrease in FA (P=0.000). Conclusion These results show the great potential and capacity of DT-MRI measures as very useful biomarkers and indicators for the evaluation of myelin injury in the optic nerve.

78349258650	Comparative analysis of quasi-conformal deformations in shape space	A novel approach based on the shape space concept is proposed to classify quasi-conformal deformations of 3D models. A new metric on the quotient space of meshes is introduced to capture changes of the curvature at each vertex of a simplicial complex during deformation. Then, the deformation curve is obtained by calculating the geodesic curve connecting two shapes in the shape space manifold. In order to compare the deformations, the deformation curves are first transferred to the same part of shape space. And then, the Multi-Dimensional Scaling method is employed to eliminate the redundant dimensions facilitating easy comparison of the deformations. To evaluate our method, some synthetic datasets and 23 datasets of gated images of the left heart ventricle during one heartbeat have been examined. Our experiments show that the algorithm can effectively classify normal and abnormal left heart ventricle deformations in shape space. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

As a recently proved effective tool, Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) was applied to model and infer interactions of dependence between neurons. In the results, the gained networks of neural interactions, which correspond to different tasks with different directions and orientations, indicated that the target information was not encoded in simple ways by neuronal networks. We also explored the difference of neural interactions between delayed period and peri-movement period during reach-to-grasp task. We found that the motor control process always led to relatively more complex neural interaction networks than the plan thinking process. © 2010 IEEE.

79951742795	Glutamatergic and resting-state functional connectivity correlates of severity in major depression - the role of pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula	Glutamatergic mechanisms and resting-state functional connectivity alterations have been recently described as factors contributing to major depressive disorder (MDD). Furthermore, the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) seems to play an important role for major depressive symptoms such as anhedonia and impaired emotion processing. We investigated 22 MDD patients and 22 healthy subjects using a combined magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach. Severity of depression was rated using the 21-item Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) and patients were divided into severely and mildly depressed subgroups according to HAMD scores. Because of their hypothesized role in depression we investigated the functional connectivity between pgACC and left anterior insular cortex (AI). The sum of Glutamate and Glutamine (Glx) in the pgACC, but not in left AI, predicted the resting-state functional connectivity between the two regions exclusively in depressed patients. Furthermore, functional connectivity between these regions was significantly altered in the subgroup of severely depressed patients (HAMD > 15) compared to healthy subjects and mildly depressed patients. Similarly the Glx ratios, relative to Creatine, in the pgACC were lowest in severely depressed patients. These findings support the involvement of glutamatergic mechanisms in severe MDD which are related to the functional connectivity between pgACC and AI and depression severity.

79952768403	Modified adaptive probabilistic neural network using for MR image segmentation	This paper presents a new approach based on modified adaptive probabilistic neural network for brain segmentation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The SOM (Self-Organizing Map) neural network is employed to overly segment the input MR image, and yield reference vectors with a large training data set for the probabilistic classification. For improving the training quality of neural work, the feature set is extracted from the statistical intensity and gradient information of the image pixels. The proposed approach also incorporates modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) to optimize the smoothing parameter of the kernel function in the neural network, enhancing its performance. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. © 2010 IEEE.

79955871446	Abnormalities of hippocampal-cortical connectivity in the temporal lobe epilepsy patients with hippocampal sclerosis	Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is the most common damage seen in the patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In the present study, the hippocampal-cortical connectivity was defined as the correlation between the hippocampal volume and cortical thickness at each vertex throughout the whole brain. We aimed to investigate the differences of ipsilateral hippocampal-cortical connectivity between the unilateral TLE-HS patients and the normal controls. In our study, the bilateral hippocampal volumes were first measured in each subject, and we found that the ipsilateral hippocampal volume significantly decreased in the left TLE-HS patients. Then, group analysis showed significant thinner average cortical thickness of the whole brain in the left TLE-HS patients compared with the normal controls. We found significantly increased ipsilateral hippocampal-cortical connectivity in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, the right cingulate gyrus and the left parahippocampal gyrus of the left TLE-HS patients, which indicated structural vulnerability related to the hippocampus atrophy in the patient group. However, for the right TLE-HS patients, no significant differences were found between the patients and the normal controls, regardless of the ipsilateral hippocampal volume, the average cortical thickness or the patterns of hippocampal-cortical connectivity, which might be related to less atrophies observed in the MRI scans. Our study provided more evidence for the structural abnormalities in the unilateral TLE-HS patients.© 2011 SPIE.

79955851830	Altered cortical anatomical networks in temporal lobe epilepsy	Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common epilepsy syndromes with focal seizures generated in the left or right temporal lobes. With the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), many evidences have demonstrated that the abnormalities in hippocampal volume and the distributed atrophies in cortical cortex. However, few studies have investigated if TLE patients have the alternation in the structural networks. In the present study, we used the cortical thickness to establish the morphological connectivity networks, and investigated the network properties using the graph theoretical methods. We found that all the morphological networks exhibited the small-world efficiency in left TLE, right TLE and normal groups. And the betweenness centrality analysis revealed that there were statistical inter-group differences in the right uncus region. Since the right uncus located at the right temporal lobe, these preliminary evidences may suggest that there are topological alternations of the cortical anatomical networks in TLE, especially for the right TLE.© 2011 SPIE.

0036041029	Image segmentation via fuzzy object extraction and edge detection and its medical application	A new interactive segmentation method that combines fuzzy connected object extraction and edge detection is proposed. Fuzzy connectedness is a global fuzzy relation, which effectively captures fuzzy "hanging togetherness" of image elements. First, by selecting the seed point, fuzzy connectedness value between each image element and the seed point is computed via dynamic programming. Then, through adjusting the parameter, the different fuzzy connected object could be extracted. Finally, an edge detection method is adopted to detect the object boundary. The algorithm is demonstrated on some medical images: segmentation of knee tissues in CT image and segmentation of brain tissues in MR image. The results show that this method works well for some CT and MR images.

0036049860	Active contour-based segmentation of medical image series	In this paper, an algorithm for the semiautomatic segmentation of medical image series is proposed by combining the live wire algorithm and the active contour model. First, we use the robust anisotropic diffusion filtering to smooth the images while keeping the edges. Then we modify the traditional live wire algorithm by combining it with the watershed method. Using the improved live wire method, the accurate segmentation of one or more medical images could be obtained firstly. Based on the segmentation of previous slices, the computer will segment the nearby slices using the modified active contour model automatically. To make full use of the correlative information between contiguous slices, a gray-scale model is applied to the model to record the local region characters of the desired object, and a new functional definition of the external energy is designed. Furthermore, in order to be adaptable with the topological change of the nearby slices, affine cell image decomposition is applied to the active contour model. The experiment results show that this algorithm can recover the boundary of the desired object from a series of medical images quickly and reliably with only little user intervention.

80053951901	Network-based classification using cortical thickness of AD patients	In this article we propose a framework for establishing individual structural networks. An individual network is established for each subject using the mean cortical thickness of cortical regions as defined by the AAL atlas. Specifically, for each subject, we compute a similarity matrix of mean cortical thickness between pairs of cortical regions, which we refer to hereafter as the individual's network. Such individual networks can be used for classification. We use a combination of two types of feature selection approaches to search for the most discriminative edges. These edges serve as the input to a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed method by a comparison with classifying the raw cortical thickness data, and individual networks, using a publically available dataset. In particular, 83 subjects from the OASIS database were chosen to validate this approach, 39 of which were diagnosed with either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the remaining were age-matched controls. While using an SVM on the raw cortical thickness data or individual networks without hybrid feature selection resulted in less than or nearly 80% classification accuracy, our approach yielded 90.4% classification accuracy in leave-one-out analysis. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

83655201212	Cortical thickness analysis and optimized voxel-based morphometry in children and adolescents with prelingually profound sensorineural hearing loss	Crossmodal neuroplastic changes following auditory deprivation in individuals with profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) have been well documented in previous literature. However, previous studies have shown very little evidence of structural brain changes in individuals with prelingually profound SNHL and no studies have reported significant differences of gray matter (GM) in deaf subjects. Therefore, it is essential to employ a more specific and sensitive technique to detect subtle structural brain differences in deaf individuals. The objective of our study was to investigate neuroanatomical differences in children and adolescents with profound SNHL by cortical thickness analysis and optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM). T1-weighted volumetric images of 16 children and adolescents with prelingually profound SNHL and 16 hearing controls were analyzed. The ANCOVA analysis revealed a statistically significant decreased average cortical thickness of the whole brain. As to vertex-based analysis, cortical thickness of the deaf subjects showed significant thinning in the left precentral gyrus, right postcentral gyrus, the left superior occipital gyrus and the left fusiform gyrus compared with the hearing subjects. VBM revealed statistically significant focal reduction of white matter (WM) volume in the left middle frontal gyrus and the right inferior occipital gyrus in deaf subjects without statistically significant differences in GM volume between the two groups. These findings demonstrated that structural changes happened not only in the WM but also in the GM of the subjects with prelingually profound SNHL, which have never been reported before in any previous literature. Our results also implicated the potential neuroplastic changes associated with crossmodal reorganization in the brain after auditory deprivation in the early deafness. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: DTI data of auditory brain and associated brain regions and three dimensional fast spoiled gradient echo sequence of the whole brain were completed in 15 patients with congenital deaf patients and 28 healthy volunteers. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the white matter in congenital deaf patients were compared with those in volunteers with TBSS of DTI data. Results: Compared with volunteers, FA values significantly decreased in the white matter of bilateral inferior frontal gyri, superior temporal gyrus, posterior medial portion of middle temporal gyrus, bilateral anterior limbs of internal capsule, external capsule, optic radiation in congenitally deaf patients (P<0.05). The extent of decrease of FA value in the white matter of posterior medial portion of left middle temporal gyrus and left optic radiation was larger than that in the right in congenitally deaf patients. Conclusion: Significant decrease of FA value in the white matter of auditory brain and associated brain regions is demonstrated in congenitally deaf patients, suggesting hypomyelination and/or fewer fibers of these brain regions.

84861164571	Quantification of the human lateral geniculate nucleus in vivo using MR imaging based on morphometry: Volume loss with age	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because it is a small subcortical structure, the precise measurement of the human LGN is still a technical challenge. In this article, we identify the LGN in vivo, measure its volume based on high-resolution MR imaging, and then relate its volume to subject age to evaluate the potential clinical application. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A semiautomatic LGN isolation method was developed on scans obtained with 1.5T MR imaging, which involves highlighting the surrounding landmarks, obtaining candidate LGN voxels with a region-growing algorithm, and isolating the LGN from the ventral diencephalon. The method was accessed with a test-retest reliability on the results from 55 healthy subjects at different ages. RESULTS: This method showed high test-retest within-subject reliability (ICC, 0.950 and 0.948 in left and right hemispheres, respectively) among 3 independent measurements in each subject. The unilateral volume was highly variable, ranging from 52 to 102 mm

BN model was applied to model and evaluate neural interaction networks from recorded neural spike trains data of each set. Our results showed that for delay period across sets, interaction level of neural network tended to be higher during later stage of adaptation than during begin stage, which indicated the monkey performed more fully preparation through adaptation. In addition, for both delay period and peri-movement period, the neural interaction networks tended to change more stably from one set to the next as the monkey adapted to the perturbation experiment better. © 2011 IEEE.

84865999895	Classification of ADHD children through multimodal magnetic resonance imaging	Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common diseases in school-age children. To date, the diagnosis of ADHD is mainly subjective and studies of objective diagnostic method are of great importance. Although many efforts have been made recently to investigate the use of structural and functional brain images for the diagnosis purpose, few of them are related to ADHD. In this paper, we introduce an automatic classification framework based on brain imaging features of ADHD patients and present in detail the feature extraction, feature selection, and classifier training methods. The effects of using different features are compared against each other. In addition, we integrate multimodal image features using multi-kernel learning (MKL). The performance of our framework has been validated in the ADHD-200 Global Competition, which is a world-wide classification contest on the ADHD-200 datasets. In this competition, our classification framework using features of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) was ranked the 6th out of 21 participants under the competition scoring policy and performed the best in terms of sensitivity and J-statistic. © 2012 Dai, Wang, Hua and He.

0036756023	Interactive segmentation method for medical texture images	An interactive segmentation algorithm is proposed for medial texture images. It consisted of three steps: parameter training, fuzzy affinity-based region growing, and snake-based boundary refining. First, in parameter training, some seed points are specified by the user interactively in the desired object, which would improve the accuracy of segmentation. In region growing, the texture feature is introduced into the definition of fuzzy affinity relation proposed by J.K. Udupa in order to make fusion of the intensity and texture information, and a new method of selecting the optimal threshold is proposed to extract the object automatically. To refine the boundary of the object, an improved snake method is adopted, in which a new definition of the external energy is designed by incorporating the prior knowledge of the desired object. This method is applied to segment to CT and MR images with the regular texture information. The experiment results show that it can produce good results for this kind of image.

84870002220	Human age estimation with surface-based features from MRI images	Over the past years, many efforts have been made in the estimation of the physiological age based on the human MRI brain images. In this paper, we propose a novel regression model with surface-based features to estimate the human age automatically and accurately. First, individual regional surface-based features (thickness, mean curvature, Gaussian curvature and surface area) from the MRI image were extracted, which were subsequently used to construct combined regional features and the brain networks. Then, the individual regional surface-based features, brain network with surface-based features and combined regional surface-based features were used for age regression by relevance vector machine (RVM), respectively. In the experiment, a dataset of 360 healthy subjects aging from 20 to 82 years was used to evaluate the performance. Experimental results based on 10-fold cross validation show that, compared to the previous methods, age estimation model with combined surface-based features can yield a remarkably high accuracy (mean absolute error: 4.6 years and root mean squared error: 5.6 years) and a significantly high correlation coefficient (r = 0.94), which is the best age estimation result as far as we know and suggests that surface-based features are more powerful than other features used in previous methods for human age estimation. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84870339173	Altered hemispheric symmetry found in left-sided mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE/HS) but not found in right-sided MTLE/HS	Purpose: The purpose was to investigate the altered hemispheric asymmetry in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with unilateral hippocampus sclerosis (MTLE/HS). Materials and methods: This study examined the hemispheric asymmetry of regional gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume among a group of 13 patients with left-sided MTLE/HS, a group of 10 patients with right-sided MTLE/HS and a group of 21 age- and gender- matched healthy controls by optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) based on magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Compared to healthy controls, abnormal asymmetries were detected in the left-sided MTLE/HS patients. The left-sided MTLE/HS patients had more GM asymmetries (L<R) in the temporal lobes, including the inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus. There was significant asymmetry (L<R) in subcortical WM of the mesial temporal lobe in left-sided MTLE/HS patients. However, no significant difference was detected in terms of GM and WM asymmetry between the group with right-sided MTLE/HS and normal controls. Conclusion: We should approach hemispheric asymmetry in left- and right-sided MTLE/HS patients differently. The study also demonstrates potential future use of VBM in detecting hemispheric asymmetries and lateralization of brain functions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84873634051	Alterations of grey matter asymmetries in adolescents with prelingual deafness: A combined VBM and cortical thickness analysis	Purpose: Prelingual deafness has been shown to lead to brain reorganization as demonstrated by functional parameters, but anatomical evidences still remain controversial. The present study investigated hemispheric asymmetry changes in deaf subjects using MRI, hypothesizing auditory-, language- or visual-related regions after early deafness. Methods: Prelingually deaf adolescents (n = 16) and age- and gender-matched normal controls (n = 16) were recruited and hemispheric asymmetry was evaluated with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) from MRI combined with analysis of cortical thickness (CTh). Results: Deaf adolescents showed more rightward asymmetries (L < R) of grey matter volume (GMV) in the cerebellum and more leftward CTh asymmetries (L > R) in the posterior cingulate gyrus and gyrus rectus. More rightward CTh asymmetries were observed in the precuneus, middle and superior frontal gyri, and middle occipital gyrus. The duration of hearing aid use was correlated with asymmetry of GMV in the cerebellum and CTh in the gyrus rectus. Interestingly, the asymmetry of the auditory cortex was preserved in deaf subjects. Conclusions: When the brain is deprived of auditory input early in life there are signs of both irreversible morphological asymmetry changes in different brain regions but also signs of reorganization and plasticity which are dependent on hearing aid use, i.e. use-dependent. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

84877913659	Parallel algorithm for cortical reconstruction based on GPU	This paper presents a fast GPU-based cortical reconstruction algorithm. The approach uses multi-resolution Over-Complete Spherical Wavelets (OCSW) decomposition and reconstruction for human cortical surface. Based on the Euclidean three-space, this paper first give proof which ensures the correctness of executing spherical harmonic and spherical convolution by independently scanning each axis. Then the proposed algorithm is implemented in parallel on GPU to achieve high performance of cortical reconstruction. Experimental results show that the cortical surfaces generated with the proposed GPU algorithm are indistinguishable with those generated with traditional CPU algorithms, while the speed of the proposed method is at least 50 times faster than that of the traditional CPU algorithm.

In this paper, we introduce spherical harmonic(SPHARM) representation to surface manifold learning and shape regression. Here, we use root mean square distance(RMSD) to measure the deformation degree of the surface, and find out that the hippocampus' deformation degree is increased over age. We also investigate the particular changing area, and discover that the hippocampus have significant changes in the frontal area and tail area, especially in CA1 subfield. © 2013 SPIE.

84880387497	Brain image segmentation method with hybrid model based on FESS	This paper presents a new brain image segmentation method based on free energy score space (FESS), which combines the advantages of both generative model and discriminative model. Through conditional random field, the generative model fuses the grey scale information, shape information and spatial neighborhood relation of the volume pixels; and the appearance feature description of subcortical structure is realized. Based on the above, the generative model is used to map the training samples to FESS feature space. Furthermore; in the discriminative model, the LS-SVM classifier is used and the data field is applied in the training process of the mixed segmentation model, which reduces the performance fluctuation of the discriminative model induced by the imbalanced training data sets and effectively improves the generalization capability. Experimental results show that the proposed model possesses better segmentation quality and performance compared with several other state-of-the-art brain image segmentation approaches.

84881583684	Reduction of gray and white matters in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and its correlation with disease duration	Objective: To measure the volumetric changes of gray and white matters in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using voxel-based morphometric study (VBM) and correlate the changes with clinical parameters. Methods: A total of 71 TLE patients were enrolled in the study, and 22 healthy subjects served as normal controls. Routine brain MRI and 3D fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR) T1-weighted images of all the subjects were acquired. The 3D structural images were co-registered, segmented and smoothed, and then the images were analyzed using the optimized VBM with preprocessed using Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration using Exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) algorithm. The global and local gray matter and white matter volume of each subject were calculated and compared between the TLE patients and normal controls. The potential correlations between the changes of the global and local gray and white matters in the TLE patients and the clinical parameters including the age at onset and the duration of epilepsy were explored. Results: Compared to the normal controls, the TLE patients had diffuse volumetric reduction of gray and white matters in cerebrum both ipsilateral and contralateral to the seizure focus (P < 0. 05). Local gray matter reduction was found extensively in bilateral cerebral lobes, especially in the temporal and frontal lobes. Local white matter reduction was found in bilateral temporal, parietal and frontal lobes, in addition to the cingulate gyrus. The global gray matter volume (Global GMV) and the global white matter volume (Global WMV) were negatively correlated to the duration of epilepsy with the most significant change occurring in the first year of epilepsy. Global WMV dropped more quickly than Global GMV during the prolonged disease course. Conclusions: TLE patients have diffuse gray matter and white matter reduction, particularly in the early stage of epilepsy. The reduction of the white matter is more obvious than the gray matter.

84880830052	Altered white matter integrity in adolescents with prelingual deafness: A high-resolution tract-based spatial statistics imaging study	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prelingual deafness is a hearing loss that occurs before language is acquired and may result in brain structural alterations. We studied microstructuralWMalterations in prelingually deaf adolescents by using DTI. We hypothesized that any morphologic alterations are mainly located in the auditory association areas. Furthermore, considering that the developing brain is both more vulnerable to deprivation and more plastic than the adult brain, we speculated that the affected areas should be larger than those previously reported in adult deafness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diffusion tensor images were obtained from 16 prelingually deaf adolescents (age range, 10 -18 years) and 16 healthy control adolescents matched for age and sex. Both groups were compared in fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity by tract-based spatial statistics. In addition, we examined the correlation between the structural data (FA, RD) differences and the duration of sign language use and hearing aid experience. RESULTS: Prelingually deaf adolescents had significantly lower FA and increased RD in the bilateral superior temporal gyri, Heschl gyrus, planum polare, and the splenium of the corpus callosum. Only RD values in the right superior temporal gyrus correlated significantly and negatively (r 0.518; P.040) with duration of sign language use. These alterations were larger than those previously reported in adult deafness. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, we found severe morphologic changes of decreased FA and increased RD in multiple auditory association areas and in the corpus callosum. These changes are signs of development impairments in prelingually deaf adolescents, possibly reflecting axonal loss or lack of myelination.

84884775398	Structural Abnormalities in Early Tourette Syndrome Children: A Combined Voxel-Based Morphometry and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics Study	Tourette Syndrome (TS) is characterized with chronic motor and vocal tics beginning in childhood. Abnormality of both gray (GM) and white matter (WM) has been observed in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits and sensory-motor cortex of adult TS patient. It is not clear if these morphological changes are also present in TS children and if there are any microstructural changes of WM. To understand the developmental cause of such changes, we investigated volumetric changes of GM and WM using VBM and microstructural changes of WM using DTI, and correlated these changes with tic severity and duration. T1 images and Diffusion Tensor Images (DTI) from 21 TS children were compared with 20 age and gender matched health control children using a 1.5T Philips scanner. All of the 21 TS children met the DSM-IV-TR criteria. T1 images were analyzed using DARTEL-VBM in conjunction with statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis was performed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). Brain volume changes were found in left superior temporal gyrus, left and right paracentral gyrus, right precuneous cortex, right pre- and post- central gyrus, left temporal occipital fusiform cortex, right frontal pole, and left lingual gyrus. Significant axial diffusivity (AD) and mean diffusivity (MD) increases were found in anterior thalamic radiation, right cingulum bundle projecting to the cingulate gurus and forceps minor. Decreases in white matter volume (WMV) in the right frontal pole were inversely related with tic severity (YGTSS), and increases in AD and MD were positively correlated with tic severity and duration, respectively. These changes in TS children can be interpreted as signs of neural plasticity in response to the experiential demand. Our findings may suggest that the morphological and microstructural measurements from structural MRI and DTI can potentially be used as a biomarker of the pathophysiologic pattern of early TS children. © 2013 Liu et al.

84885328735	Accurate prediction of AD patients using cortical thickness networks	It is widely believed that human brain is a complicated network and many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are related to abnormal changes of the brain network architecture. In this work, we present a kernel-based method to establish a network for each subject using mean cortical thickness, which we refer to hereafter as the individual's network. We construct individual networks for 83 subjects, including AD patients and normal controls (NC), which are taken from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies database. The network edge features are used to make prediction of AD/NC through the sophisticated machine learning technology. As the number of edge features is much more than that of samples, feature selection is applied to avoid the adverse impact of high-dimensional data on the performance of classifier. We use a hybrid feature selection that combines filter and wrapper methods, and compare the performance of six different combinations of them. Finally, support vector machines are trained using the selected features. To obtain an unbiased evaluation of our method, we use a nested cross validation framework to choose the optimal hyper-parameters of classifier and evaluate the generalization of the method. We report the best accuracy of 90.4 % using the proposed method in the leave-one-out analysis, outperforming that using the raw cortical thickness data by more than 10 %. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

0042626096	A new continuous level-of-detail algorithm and its application in virtual endoscopy	With the increasing of medical image datasets, the 3D model obtained by reconstruction often incorporates millions of triangles that make real time rendering very difficult. Progressive Mesh (PM) had been developed to address the above problem of view-dependent level-of-detail control, but its speed can't meet the requirement of virtual endoscopy. In this study, we developed a new view-dependent continuous level-of-detail (CLOD) algorithm for triangle meshes with subdivision connectivity. First, the mesh was simplified in hierarchy to get the simplest mesh (called as base domain), then each hierarchy of the simplified mesh was parameterized to map to the base domain, and finally the view-dependent subdivision was used to resample the mesh to get a multi-resolution model. We constructed an index to record the changes of view parameters by the adaptive octree so as to make full use of the reusability of the adjacent frame and reduce the dynamic changes of the selected levels of detail. We tested our algorithm in several different datasets. The experiments showed that our method is efficient and easy to implement, and the model can be rendered in real time to meet the requirement of virtual endoscopy.

0041624203	Points based reconstruction and rendering of 3D shapes from large volume dataset	In the field of medical imaging, researchers often need visualize lots of 3D datasets to get the information contained in these datasets. But the huge data generated by modern medical imaging device challenge the real time processing and rendering algorithms at all the time. Spurring by the great achievement of Points Based Rendering (PBR) in the fields of computer graphics to render very large meshes, we propose a new algorithm to use the points as basic primitive of surface reconstruction and rendering to interactively reconstruct and render very large volume dataset. By utilizing the special characteristic of medical image datasets, we obtain a fast and efficient points-based surface reconstruction and rendering algorithm in common PC. The experimental results show that this algorithm is feasible and efficient.

0041826793	Technique of diffusion weighted imaging and its application in stroke	To study the application of diffusion weighted imaging and image post processing in the diagnosis of stroke, especially in acute stroke, 205 patients were examined by 1.5 T or 1.0 T MRI scanner and the images such as T1, T2 and diffusion weighted images were obtained. Image post processing was done with "3 D Med System" developed by our lab to analyze data and acquire the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. In acute and subacute stage of stroke, the signal in cerebral infarction areas changed to hyperintensity in T2- and diffusion-weighted images, normal or hypointensity in T1-weighted images. In hyperacute stage, however, the signal was hyperintense just in the diffusion weighted images; others were normal. In the chronic stage, the signal in T1- and diffusion-weighted imaging showed hypointensity and hyperintensity in T2 weighted imaging. Because ADC declined obviously in acute and subacute stage of stroke, the lesion area was hypointensity in ADC map. With the development of the disease, ADC gradually recovered and then changed to hyperintensity in ADC map in chronic stage. Using diffusion weighted imaging and ADC mapping can make a diagnosis of stroke, especially in the hyperacute stage of stroke, and can differentiate acute and chronic stroke.

84889263443	Adaptive coupled variation model and its GPU implementation	This paper presents an adaptive coupled variation model based on graphic processing unit (GPU) acceleration. First, the model decomposes a given image as the sum of two components: geometric structure and oscillating pattern according to Meyer's theory, and an adaptive variation model based on diffusion tensor is used to enhance the structure part. Second, a nonlocal means filter is used to remove noise in the oscillating part while preserving the image edges and fine details. Then the general purpose computation function of the GPU is used to process the coupled variation model in parallel, and the coalesced access and shared memory combined strategy is used to greatly improve the algorithm performance. Experiment results show that the proposed model can preserve the image edge information and enhance the image texture feature well; and the processing speed of the GPU is at least 15 times faster than that of the CPU serial processing.

84889635117	Regional specificity of sex effects on subcortical volumes across the lifespan in healthy aging	When conceptualizing age-specific onsets and sex-specific characteristics of neuropsychiatric diseases in a neurobiological context, it may be crucially important to consider differential trajectories of aging. Here, we investigated effects of age, sex, and their interactions on absolute and relative volumes of subcortical structures with known involvement in psychiatric disorders, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala. Structural MRI data of 76 healthy subjects (38 males, 19-70 years) from the ICBM database were analyzed. Age-related absolute atrophy was generally found in the basal ganglia and thalamus, while in the hippocampus decline was only observed in males, and was generally absent in the amygdala. Disproportionate degeneration in the basal ganglia and thalamus, exceeding cortical decline was specific for females. When allowing higher-order models, a quadratic model could better describe the negative relation of absolute volume and age in the basal ganglia in males, and generally in the hippocampus and amygdala. We could show that negative age-relations are highly specific for certain subcortical structures in either gender. Importantly these findings also emphasize the significant impact of analytical strategies when deciding for correction of subcortical volumes to the whole-brain decline. Specifically, in the basal ganglia disproportionate shrinkage in females was suggested by the relative analysis while absolute volume analysis rather stressed an accelerating decline in older males. Given strong involvement of the basal ganglia in both cognitive aging and emotional regulation, our findings may be crucial for studies investigating the onset and prevalence of dementia and depressive symptoms in male and female aging.

84890945960	Evaluation of multiple voxel-based morphometry approaches and applications in the analysis of white matter changes in temporal lobe epilepsy	The purpose of this study was to compare multiple voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approaches and analyze the whole-brain white matter (WM) changes in the unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients relative to controls. In our study, the performance of the VBM approaches, including standard VBM, optimized VBM and VBM-DARTEL, was evaluated via a simulation, and then these VBM approaches were applied to the real data obtained from the TLE patients and controls. The results from simulation show that VBM-DARTEL performs the best among these VBM approaches. For the real data, WM reductions were found in the ipsilateral temporal lobe, the contralateral frontal and occipital lobes, the bilateral parietal lobes, cingulated gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and brainstem of the left-TLE patients by VBM-DARTEL, which is consistent with previous studies. Our study demonstrated that DARTEL was the most robust and reliable approach for VBM analysis. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

84897111238	Age estimation using cortical surface pattern combining thickness with curvatures	Brain development and healthy aging have been proved to follow a specific pattern, which, in turn, can be applied to help doctors diagnose mental diseases. In this paper, we design a cortical surface pattern (CSP) combining the cortical thickness with curvatures, which constructs an accurate human age estimation model with relevance vector regression. We test our model with two public databases. One is the IXI database (360 healthy subjects aging from 20 to 82 years old were selected), and the other is the INDI database (303 subjects aging from 7 to 22 years old were selected). The results show that our model can achieve as small as 4.57 years deviation in the IXI database and 1.38 years deviation in the INDI database. Furthermore, we employ this surface pattern to age groups classification and get a remarkably high accuracy (97.77 %) and a significantly high sensitivity/specificity (97.30/98.10 %). These results suggest that our designed CSP combining thickness with curvatures is stable and sensitive to brain development, and it is much more powerful than voxel-based morphometry used in previous methods for age estimation. © 2014 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.

84901759375	Alternations of functional connectivity in amblyopia patients: A resting-state fMRI study	Amblyopia is a common yet hard-to-cure disease in children and results in poor or blurred vision. Some efforts such as voxel-based analysis, cortical thickness analysis have been tried to reveal the pathogenesis of amblyopia. However, few studies focused on alterations of the functional connectivity (FC) in amblyopia. In this study, we analyzed the abnormalities of amblyopia patients by both the seed-based FC with the left/right primary visual cortex and the network constructed throughout the whole brain. Experiments showed the following results: (1)As for the seed-based FC analysis, FC between superior occipital gyrus and the primary visual cortex was found to significantly decrease in both sides. The abnormalities were also found in lingual gyrus. The results may reflect functional deficits both in dorsal stream and ventral stream. (2)Two increased functional connectivities and 64 decreased functional connectivities were found in the whole brain network analysis. The decreased functional connectivities most concentrate in the temporal cortex. The results suggest that amblyopia may be caused by the deficits in the visual information transmission. © 2014 SPIE.

84902274486	Local cortical thinning links to resting-state disconnectivity in major depressive disorder	Background Local structural and metabolic as well as inter-regional connectivity abnormalities have been implicated in the neuropathology of major depressive disorder (MDD). How local tissue properties affect intrinsic functional connectivity is, however, unclear. Using a cross-sectional, multi-modal imaging approach, we investigated the relationship between local cortical tissue abnormalities and intrinsic resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in MDD. Method A total of 20 MDD in-patients and 20 healthy controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T for structural and functional imaging. Whole-brain cortical thickness was calculated and compared between groups. Regions with reduced cortical thickness defined seeds for subsequent whole-brain RSFC analyses. Contributions of structural tissue abnormalities on inter-regional RSFC were explicitly investigated. Results Lower cortical thickness was observed in MDD in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), superior temporal gyrus/temporal pole, middle-posterior cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral PFC. No differences in local fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations were observed. Lower thickness in patients' dorsomedial PFC further directly and selectively affected its RSFC with the precuneus, which was unaffected by symptom severity. No effects of cortical thickness in other regions showing abnormal thickness were observed to influence functional connectivity. Conclusions Abnormal cortical thickness in the dorsomedial PFC in MDD patients was observed to selectively and directly affect its intrinsic connectivity with the precuneus in MDD patients independent of depression severity, thereby marking a potential vulnerability for maladaptive mood regulation. Future studies should include an unmedicated sample and replicate findings using independent component analysis to test for morphometric effects on network integrity. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

84906824613	Dissociation of glutamate and cortical thickness is restricted to regions subserving trait but not state markers in major depressive disorder	Background The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays an important role in the neuropathology of major depressive disorder (MDD). So far, the effect of local cortical alteration on metabolites in multiple subdivisions of ACC has not been studied. We aimed to investigate structural and biochemical changes and their relationship in the pregenual ACC (pgACC), dorsal ACC (dACC) in MDD. Methods We obtained magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in two investigated regions for 24 depressed patients and matched controls. In each region, cortical thickness (CTh) was calculated within a template mask based on its MRS voxel. We investigated neurotransmitter concentrations of Glx, N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), and myo-inositol (m-Ins) in two investigated regions, as well as their relationships with CTh in depressed individuals and healthy controls. Results Patients showed significantly lower cortical thickness in dACC compared to controls. Glx in dACC significantly correlated with CTh in healthy controls but not MDD patients, while NAA and CTh in dACC significantly correlated in both groups. A marginal decrease of Glx in pgACC was found in the subgroup of more severely depressive patients, compared to the mildly depressed patients. Limitations Modest sample size and lack of episodes of depression may limit the generalizability of our findings. Conclusion Our results indicate an abolished CTh-MRS relation in dACC - associated with structural decline - but not in pgACC, where acute MRS alterations prevailed. Our study provides the first evidence of a neurochemical basis explaining some of the inter-individual variability in CTh in MDD. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1242330319	A Practical Surface Reconstruction Algorithm for Very Large Medical Datasets	In this paper a practical surface reconstruction algorithm is proposed to efficiently process very large medical dataset in general PC. By considering the conflict between memory consumption and traversal speed, we restrict the traditional surface tracking in single layer and thus get a better trade-off between them. We also use a compression scheme to store the generated mesh, which decrease the memory requirement considerably. For efficient rendering, we employ a triangle strips generation algorithm to decode directly the com-pressed mesh into triangle strip. The experimental results tested on visible man fresh CT dataset show that the proposed algorithm is very efficient in both extracting and rendering phase.
