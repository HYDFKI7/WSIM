1642377825	The interaction of Schwann cells with chitosan membranes and fibers in vitro	The bridging of nerve gaps is still one of the major problems in peripheral nerve regeneration. A promising alternative for the repair of peripheral nerve injuries is the bioartificial nerve graft, comprised of a biomaterial pre-seeded with Schwann cells (SCs), which is an effective substrate for enhancing nerve regeneration. Interaction between cultured SCs and biomaterials is of importance. For the purposes of this study, culture systems of normal SCs were used. The biocompatibility of chitosan, including chitosan membranes and chitosan fibers, was evaluated in vitro. The growth of SCs was observed by light and scanning electron microscopy at regular intervals. SCs were identified by immunocytochemical staining and the viability of SCs was measured by MTT assay. The experimental results indicated that SCs could grow onto chitosan materials with two different shapes: spherical and long olivary. They contacted with the extensions. The long olivary cells inclined to encircle chitosan fibers up. It was also found that the cells on the chitosan fibers migrated faster than those on the chitosan membranes. There was a good biological compatibility between chitosan and SCs. Compared with the chitosan membranes, SCs migrated more easily onto the stereoframe of chitosan fibers. These studies contribute information necessary to enhancing our understanding of biocompatibility of chitosan. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To study the expression of growth-associated protein (GAP-43) and its mRNA in distal stump of rat injured sciatic nerve and to provide experimental basis for improving microenviorment. Methods. Western Blot and RT-PCR were used to detect the different expression of GAP-43 and its mRNA in the distal stump of injured sciatic nerve. Results. RT-PCR result, the expression of GAP-43 mRNA was in low levels in the normal sciatic nerve and increased significantly after nerve injury, and reached climax at the second week after the sciatic nerve was injured. Western Blot results with anti-GAP-43 antibody, the special positive band of 43 kDa protein was light in normal sciatic nerve and deep staining positive band of 43 kDa protein in the distal stump of injured sciatic nerve, and reached the peak at the third week. Conclusion. The expression of GAP-43 and its mRNA are increased significantly in distal stump of injured sciatic nerve. The up-regulation peak of GAP-43 mRNA is at the second week, the peak of the protein synthesis is at the third week, and its up-regulation is impressed by nerve injury.

23444448276	Dog sciatic nerve regeneration across a 30-mm defect bridged by a chitosan/PGA artificial nerve graft	We have developed a dual-component artificial nerve graft comprising an outer microporous conduit of chitosan and internal oriented filaments of polyglycolic acid (PGA). The novel graft was used for bridging sciatic nerve across a 30-mm defect in six Beagle dogs, which were used as a chitosan/PGA graft group. The other Beagle dogs were divided into an autograft group (n = 6) as the positive control and a non-grafted group (n = 5) as the negative control. All animals of three groups were monitored for changes in their appearance and locomotion activities after surgery. Their posture and gait were recorded regularly with the aid of photographs and videotapes for each dog. Six months post-operatively, a combination of electrophysiological examination, FluoroGold retrograde tracing, histological assessment including light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry as well as morphometric analyses to both regenerated nerves and target muscles was utilized to investigate the nerve repair effects of our artificial nerve graft. The results demonstrated that, in the chitosan/PGA graft group, the dog sciatic nerve trunk had been reconstructed with restoration of nerve continuity and functional recovery, and its target skeletal muscle had been re-innervated, improving locomotion activities of the operated limb. This study proves the feasibility of the chitosan/PGA artificial nerve graft for peripheral nerve regeneration by bridging a longer defect in a large animal model. © The Author (2005).

33645301282	Study of in vivo differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells into Schwann cell-like cells	In order to raise an abundant and accessible reservoir for Schwann cells (SCs), which are used as seed cells for constructing tissue-engineered nerve grafts, we investigated the feasibilty of in vivo differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) into SC-like cells. In this study, MSCs were harvested from adult rats' bone marrow, culture-expanded, and characterized. Subcultured MSCs were then labeled with Hoechst 33342, followed by transplantation into the nerve regeneration chamber, which was made of a silicone tube bridging the sciatic nerve defect of the rats. Four weeks after surgery, some of the differentiated MSCs turned into SC-like cells immunopositive to S-100 protein, accompanied by myelination of the regenerated nerve fibers. Walking-track analyses provided evidence that transplantation of MSCs contributed to reconstruction of the sciatic nerve and reinnervation of target tissues. The experimental results suggest that MSCs are capable of differentiating into SC-like cells in vivo, making them a promising candidate for cell transplantation in peripheral nerve repair. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

33745250492	Immunohistochemical localization of the corticospinal tract in normal rat spinal cord as a stereotactic guidance for implantation of microelectronic chip	In order to investigate the pick-up, the process and the regeneration of central neural signals for neural function regeneration by means of microelectronic techniques, it is necessary to do a more detailed investigation, primarily of the stereotactic anatomical bases of corticospinal tract (CST). In present study, we use a polyclonal antibody against protein kinase C gamma subspecies (PKC γ) as a specific marker of CST to reveal the precise localization of CST in rat spinal cord by immunohistochemistry. The strong PKC γ immunoreactivities in axons of CST were found in the pyramid and pyramidal decussation of medulla oblongata, and then from the cervical to lumbar spinal cord, PKC γ immunoreactivities were found to descend caudully through the white matter occupying the ventral most portion of the posterior funiculus. At the conus medullaris, the positive reactivities of PKC γ appeared at the midline of the posterior funiculus. The area of positive reactivities of PKC γ decreased in size caudally in different spinal cord segments. These findings suggest that PKC γ immunohistochemical method can show the accurate position of corticospinal tract in rat spinal cord clearly, and provide the stereotactic anatomical bases for the microelectronic chip implantation in spinal cord. © 2005 IEEE.

33744955382	EST-based identification of genes expressed in brain and spinal cord of Gekko japonicus, a species demonstrating intrinsic capacity of spinal cord regeneration	In the present study, a brain and spinal cord cDNAlibrary of Gekko japonicus was constructed, and 2349 unique expressed sequence tags (ESTs), composed of 494 clusters and 1855 singletons, were determined from 4108 randomly selected clones. Of these sequences, 54.8% (1287/2349) ESTs are identified as known genes and 45.2% (1062/2349), as unknown genes. The identified ESTs were classified with respect to their functional categorization; both the housekeeping genes and the nervous system-related genes were well represented in the library. The complete open reading frame (ORF)-containing clones derived from the library were identified as well; 303 clones were obtained to date. Finally, two clones with sequence homology to endothelial differentiation- related factor 1 (EDF-1) and to myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) precursor were selected, and their expression patterns in normal and regenerating spinal cord were analyzed by RT-PCR. Both of them were expressed in the spinal cord, and the expression level decreased significantly after tail amputation. This study provides a preliminary view of the gene expression profiles of the central nervous system in gecko, and it might accelerate the process of gene discovery and function analysis in this organism, which demonstrates an intrinsic capacity of spinal cord regeneration.

33746034164	Expression of myostatin RNA transcript and protein in gastrocnemius muscle of rats after sciatic nerve resection	Myostatin, a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, has been identified as an inhibitor of skeletal muscle mass. To have an insight into the expression pattern of myostatin and its potential role in skeletal muscle atrophy induced by denervation, we used an animal model of peripheral nerve resection to examine the time-dependent changes in myostatin mRNA and protein levels in the denervated gastrocnemius muscle of rats after sciatic neurectomy by the aid of quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. We also conducted morphometric analyses to measure the wet weight ratio of the denervated muscle (the operated side/contralateral non-operated side) and the cross sectional area of muscle fibers and to observe muscle morphology. The experimental results showed that myostatin mRNA and protein levels in rat gastrocnemius muscle persistently elevated after denervation, despite a fluctuation of myostatin mRNA level at day 3 after denervation, reached their respective peaks at day 28 after denervation, and then depressed slightly until day 56 after denervation. Furthermore, a significant negative linear correlation was found between myostatin abundance and muscle atrophy degree, suggesting that myostatin might probably play an important role in denervation-induced muscle atrophy. Our present study perhaps provides a new window into myostatin regulation in association with a specific type of muscle atrophy. © Springer 2005.

33745685992	Investigation of differentially expressed proteins in rat gastrocnemius muscle during denervation-reinnervation	To have a better insight into the molecular events involved in denervation-induced atrophy and reinnervation-induced regeneration of skeletal muscles, it is important to investigate the changes in expression levels of a great multitude of muscle proteins during the process of denervation- reinnervation. In this study, we employed an experimental model of rat sciatic nerve crush to examine the differentially expressed proteins in the rat gastrocnemius muscle at different time points (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks) after sciatic nerve crush by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), collectively referred to as the modern proteomic analysis. The results showed that 16 proteins in the rat gastrocnemius muscle exhibited two distinct types of change pattern in their relative abundance: (1) The relative expression levels of 11 proteins (including alpha actin, myosin heavy chain, etc.)were decreased either within 1 or 2 weeks post-sciatic nerve injury, followed by restoration during the ensuing days until 4 weeks. (2) The other 5 proteins (including alpha enolase, beta enolase, signal peptide peptidase-like 3, etc.) displayed an up-regulation in their relative expression levels within 1 week following sciatic nerve injury, and a subsequent gradual decrease in their relative expression levels until 4 weeks. Moreover, the significance of the changes in expression levels of the 16 proteins during denervation-reinnervation has been selectively discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.

33748333245	Intermittent pneumatic compression regulates expression of nitric oxide synthases in skeletal muscles	This study investigated the effects of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) on expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms in compressed (anterior tibialis, AT) and uncompressed (cremaster muscles, CM) skeletal muscles. Following IPC application of 0.5, 1, and 5 h on both legs of rats, the endothelial NOS (eNOS) mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated to 1.2-, 1.8, and 2.7-fold from normal, respectively, in both AT and CM, and protein expression increased more than 1.5-fold of normal at each time point. Similarly, neuronal NOS expression was up-regulated, but to a lesser degree. In contrast, inducible NOS expression was significantly and time-dependently down-regulated in both muscles. After IPC cessation, eNOS levels returned to normal in both AT and CM. The results confirm our hypothesis that IPC-induced vasodilation is mediated by regulating expression of NOS isoforms, in particular eNOS, in both compressed and uncompressed skeletal muscles. The results also suggest the importance of precisely characterizing expression of each NOS isoform in tissue pathophysiology. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33748473622	Tpc1808 increases expression of NF-H in PC12 cells	Tpc1808 is a candidate chemotropic factor induced by nerve injury, and we report here the role of rat Tpc1808 in the expression of high-molecular-weight neurofilament (NF-H) in PC12 cells. A full-length Tpc1808 cDNA encoding the 275-amino-acid protein was constructed into pcDNA-HA and transfected into PC12 cells. The increased expression of NF-H was detectable in PC12-Tpc1808 clones by semi-qRT-PCR, real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Such an increase could also be observed in PC12 cells subjected to recombinant Tpc1808 protein by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. At a concentration of 0.1 μg/mL, Tpc1808 protein, similar to NGF, could promote the expression of NF-H in a time-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that Tpc1808 is the gene related to promotion of nerve growth, and both the Tpc1808 gene and the Tpc1808 recombinant protein up-regulate the expression of NF-H in PC12 cells.

33750701834	Expression and distribution of trihydrophobin 1 in postnatal developing mouse testis	The human trihydrophobin 1 (TH1) is a highly conserved and widely expressed protein. It is clear that TH1 serves as a new specific negative regulator of A-Raf kinase. In this study, we found that TH1 associated with A-Raf in mouse testis by using coimmunoprecipitation analysis. Then we characterized the gene expression of TH1 in mouse testis and analyzed the changes of TH1 protein during postnatal development. The protein expression of TH1 in mouse testis was further analyzed by immunohistochemistry staining. Strong signals were detected in the seminiferous tubules and the distribution patterns varied with the different ages of postnatal mouse testis. TH1 was distributed in spermatocytes and Sertoli cells at 2 weeks postnatal, and was abundant in spermatogonia at 8 weeks postnatal. Leydig cells were positive to TH1 throughout testicular development. A high expression of TH1 in both Leydig cells and mouse Leydig tumor cells (mLTC-1cells) was found to be concentrated in the cytoplasm. The colocalization of TH1 and A-Raf in mLTC-1 cells or in adult testis was also observable. © Springer Science + Business Media, B.V. 2006.

33846133217	Biocompatibility evaluation of silk fibroin with peripheral nerve tissues and cells in vitro	Silk-based materials have been used in the field of bone or ligament tissue engineering. In order to explore the feasibility of using purified silk fibroin to construct artificial nerve grafts, it is necessary to evaluate the biocompatibility of silk fibroin material with peripheral nerve tissues and cells. We cultured rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) on the substrate made up of silk fibroin fibers and observed the cell outgrowth from DRG during culture by using light and electron microscopy coupled with immunocytochemistry. On the other hand, we cultured Schwann cells from rat sciatic nerves in the silk fibroin extract fluid and examined the changes of Schwann cells after different times of culture. The results of light microscopy, MTT test and cell cycle analysis showed that Schwann cells cultured in the silk fibroin extract fluid showed no significant difference in their morphology, cell viability and proliferation as compared to that in plain L15 medium. Furthermore, no significant difference was found in expression of the factors secreted by Schwann cells, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and S-100, between Schwann cells cultured in the silk fibroin extraction fluid and in plain L15 medium by the aid of immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and Western analysis. Collectively, these data indicate that silk fibroin has good biocompatibility with DRG and is also beneficial to the survival of Schwann cells without exerting any significant cytotoxic effects on their phenotype or functions, thus providing an experimental foundation for the development of silk fibroin as a candidate material for nerve tissue engineering applications. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

34247136271	The effect of different sterilization procedures on chitosan dried powder	The aim of this study was to investigate the effects induced by three different sterilization methods [steam, γ-radiation, and ethylene oxide (EO)] with different dose or time period of sterilization by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and assessments of molecular weight and degree of deacetylation. The experiment results clearly showed that the steam sterilization greatly darkened the color of chitosan powder; γ-irradiation strongly depolymerized the chitosan especially at irradiation dose above 10 kGy; and exposure to EO led to minor change in crystallinity and network structure of chitosan powder. Therefore, these three methods have their respective advantages and disadvantages, suggesting that the selection of the sterilization method of chitosan should depend upon the specific requirement of the final application. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

34250767687	Multichannel neural signal detecting module: Its design and test in animal experiments	A four-channel neural signal detecting module with an implantable 12-contact cuff electrode was designed for real-time neural signal recording on peripheral and central nerves. The mathematic coupling model between nerve and electronic system was analyzed. Electrode connection configurations were considered. The detecting circuit included an input coupling network, a pre-amplifier, and some filtering and notching stages. Shield guarding and the right-leg-driven circuit were developed for further elimination of common mode interference. By electrode switches, the module could cooperate with a nerve functional electrical stimulation circuit, building a neural channel bridge-connection system. It was tested by recording experiments on rat's sciatic and spine nerves. The signals in spontaneous and evoked conditions have been captured successfully. In addition, an implantable neural signal detecting CMOS IC has been introduced.

34250799692	Effect of nerve regeneration factor on expression of inducible-nitric oxide synthase in retina with experimental intraocular hypertension	Objective: It is generally believed nitric oxide is one of the toxins which result in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) apoptosis. Nerve regeneration factor (NRF) from Chinese medicine has neuroprotective effect. This article studied whether NRF can protect RGCs with experimental intraocular hypertention by downregulating expression of inducible-nitric oxide synthase(i-NOS) in rabbit retina. Methods: Experimental high intraocular pressure (IOP) models were established by balance salt solution perfusion into anterior chamber in the right eyes of 12 rabbits. 4.5 μg of NRF or 5 μl of PBS(0.1 mol/L) was injected respectively into vitreous body cavity of right eyes of rabbits in NRF group (n = 6) or PBS group (n = 6) before perfusion and at 4, 7 days in postperfusion. The left eyes of NRF group and PBS group served as normal control group. IOP was detected using Sehiötz tonometer before and after perfusion 4, 7, 14 days. The RT-PCR was used to examine the effect of NRF on expression of i-NOSmRNA in retina. Results: No significant differences were found in IOP between NRF and PBS group at different time point (t = 0.241, P = 0. 728; t = 0.438, P = 0.629; t = 0.256, P = 0.821; t = 1.557, P = 0.183). The expression level of i-NOSmRNA in NRF group,PBS group and normal control group was (68.70 ± 14.55 ), (146.00 ± 5.01) and (50.02 ± 3.50) .respectively. The expression level of i-NOSmRNA in NRF group (OD value) was significantly decreased compared with PBS group(P = 0.000), but remained a higher level in comparison with normal control group. Conclusion: NRF could down-regulate the expression of i-NOSmRNA in retina in high IOP eyes, which could protect retinal ganglion cells from glaucomatous neuropathy.

35048843763	Decreased estradiol release from astrocytes contributes to the neurodegeneration in a mouse model of Niemann-Pick disease type C	Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a deadly neurodegenerative disease often caused by mutation in a gene called NPC1, which results in the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in the endosomal-lysosomal system. Most studies on the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in NPC have focused on neurons. However, the possibility also exists that NPC1 affects neuronal functions indirectly by acting on other cells that are intimately interacting with neurons. In this study, using a heterotypic neuron-glia coculture system, we found that wild-type neurons cultured on a layer of NPC1-/- astrocytes showed decreased neurite growth compared with those cultured on wild-type astrocytes. RT-PCR and immunohistochemical assessments showed significantly lower expression of neurosteroid enzymes and StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) in NPC1-/-astrocyte cultures than in wild-type cultures. Furthermore, a reduced level of estradiol was measured from both astrocyte culture medium and whole brains from NPC1-/- mice. Administration of 17β-estradiol to neonatal NPC1-/- mice significantly delayed the onset of neurological symptoms, increased Purkinje cell survival, and extended the animals' life span. Our findings suggest that astrocyte dysfunction contributes to the neurodegeneration of NPC and estradiol treatment may be useful in ameliorating progression of the disease. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

35248888452	Biocompatibility studies of silk fibroin-based artificial nerve grafts in vitro and in vivo	Silk fibroin (SF) has been used extensively in the biomedical field including tissue engineering for the generation of artificial bones, skins or ligaments. We have previously reported on good in vitro biocompatibility of SF fibers with peripheral nerve tissues and cells. In the present study, we developed a novel design of the SF-based artificial nerve graft (SF graft) which was composed of a SF-nerve guidance conduit (NGC) inserted with SF fibers. MTT assay was performed to determine the cytotoxicity of the SF-NGC extract fluid on the cultured L929 cells derived from an immortalized mouse fibroblast cell line. In addition, this SF graft was implanted into adult rats for bridging a 10-mm long sciatic nerve defect. The following-up experiments at initial stage (1-4 week) of nerve regeneration including routine blood tests and histochemical investigation were conducted to evaluate the in vivo biocompatibility of the SF graft with peripheral nerves. The results demonstrated that the SF-NGC graft was biocompatible with the surrounding tissues and cells due to its low inflammatory potential with a grade 0 under the U.S. Pharmacopeia guidelines and it was generally suitable to a certain degree for bridging peripheral nerve defects in virtue of supporting Schwann cell adherence, expansion and migration. Therefore the SF graft is a promising alternative to classical autografts for peripheral nerve repair.

35348975160	Development and evaluation of silk fibroin-based nerve grafts used for peripheral nerve regeneration	Silk fibroin (SF), derived from natural silk long used as a textile material, has recently become an important biomaterial for tissue engineering applications. We have previously reported on good in vitro biocompatibility of SF fibers with peripheral nerve tissues and cells. In the present study, we developed a novel biomimetic design of the SF-based nerve graft (SF graft) which was composed of a SF-nerve guidance conduit (NGC) inserted with oriented SF filaments. The SF-NGC prepared via well-established procedures exhibits an eggshell-like microstructure that is responsible for its superior mechanical and permeable properties beneficial to nerve regeneration. The SF graft was used for bridge implantation across a 10-mm long sciatic nerve defect in rats, and the outcome of peripheral nerve repair at 6 months post-implantation was evaluated by a combination of electrophysiological assessment, FluoroGold retrograde tracing and histological investigation. The examined functional and morphological parameters show that SF grafts could promote peripheral nerve regeneration with effects approaching those elicited by nerve autografts which are generally considered as the gold standard for treating large peripheral nerve defects, thus raising a potential possibility of using these newly developed nerve grafts as a promising alternative to nerve autografts. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

33644837203	Increased divalent metal transporter 1 expression might be associated with the neurotoxicity of L-DOPA	Based on the available data, we speculated that changes in brain iron metabolism induced by L-DOPA might be associated with the neurotoxicity of L-DOPA. To investigate this possibility, the effects of L-DOPA on the expression of iron influx proteins [transferrin receptor (TfR) and divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1)], iron efflux protein (ferroportin 1), and iron uptake in C6 glioma cells were determined in this study using Northern blot and Western blot analysis and the calcein method. The findings showed that treatment of C6 cells with different concentrations of L-DOPA (0-100 μM) did not affect the expression of mRNA and protein of TfR and DMT1 with iron-responsive element (+IRE) and protein of ferroportin 1. However, a significant increase in the expression of DMT1(-IRE) mRNA and protein was found in cells treated, respectively, with 10 and 30 μM L-DOPA (mRNA) and 1, 5, 10 and 30 μM L-DOPA (protein). The increase in DMT(-IRE) protein induced by L-DOPA treatment was in parallel with the increase in DMT(-IRE) mRNA. The levels of DMT1(-IRE) mRNA and protein peaked in the cells treated with 10 μM L-DOPA and then decreased progressively with increasing concentrations of L-DOPA. Further study demonstrated that treatment of the cells with 10 μM L-DOPA induced a significant increase in ferrous uptake by C6 glioma cells. The findings suggested that the increased DMT1(-IRE) expression might be partly associated with the neurotoxicity of L-DOPA. Clinical relevance of the findings needs to be investigated further.

34247603374	Expression pattern of myostatin in gastrocnemius muscle of rats after sciatic nerve crush injury	Myostatin is a strong inhibitor of skeletal muscle growth. The purpose of this study was to investigate myostatin expression profiles during denervation-induced muscle atrophy in order to understand the relationship between myostatin expression and muscle atrophy. We constructed a sciatic nerve crush model, undertook morphometric analyses of rat gastrocnemius muscle to evaluate the degree of muscle atrophy, and utilized a real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis to measure myostatin mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively, in the gastrocnemius at different time-points after nerve injury. Muscle atrophy changed in a parabola-like manner from day 1 to day 28 after nerve injury, with a maximum value at day 14. During this time, myostatin expression changed in the reverse manner, with myostatin mRNA or protein expression gradually increasing from days 1-14, and then gradually declining to day 28, when the normal level was reached. Statistical analyses further provided evidence for a significant negative linear correlation between myostatin expression and muscle atrophy within a 28-day period after nerve injury. Our study thus describes the expression pattern of myostatin in response to a specific type of muscle atrophy and raises the possibility of developing myostatin as a therapeutic target for future clinical applications. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

34249037395	Multi-channel neural signal stimulating module and in-vivo experiments	The module for function electrical stimulation (FES) of neurons is designed for the research of the neural function regeneration microelectronic system, which is an in-body embedded micro module. It is implemented by using discrete devices at first and characterized in vitro. The module is used to stimulate sciatic nerve and spinal cord of rats and rabbits for in-vivo real-time experiments of the neural function regeneration system. Based on the module, a four channel module for the FES of neurons is designed for 12 sites cuff electrode or 10 sites shaft electrode. Three animal experiments with total five rats and two rabbits were made. In the in-vivo experiment, the neural signals including spontaneous and imitated were regenerated by the module. The stimulating signal was used to drive sciatic nerve and spinal cord of rats and rabbits, successfully caused them twitch in different parts of their bodies, such as legs, tails, and fingers. This testifies that the neural function regeneration system can regenerate the neural signals.

40949134167	Morphological and functional characterization of predifferentiation of myelinating glia-like cells from human bone marrow stromal cells through activation of F3/Notch signaling in mouse retina	Recently, we have demonstrated that F3/contactin and NB-3 are trans-acting extracellular ligands of Notch that promote differentiation of neural stem cells and oligodendrocyte precursor cells into mature oligodendrocytes (OLs). Here, we demonstrate that human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) can be induced to differentiate into cells with myelinating glial cell characteristics in mouse retina after predifferentiation in vitro. Isolated CD90(+) hBMSCs treated with β-mercaptoethanol for 1 day and retinoic acid for 3 days in culture changed into myelinating glia-like cells (MGLCs). More cells expressed NG2, an early OL marker, after treatment, but expression of O4, a mature OL marker, was negligible. Subsequently, the population of O4(+) cells was significantly increased after the MGLCs were predifferentiated in culture in the presence of either F3/contactin or multiple factors, including forskolin, basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and heregulin, in vitro for another 3 days. Notably, 2 months after transplantation into mouse retina, the predifferentiated cells changed morphologically into cells resembling mature MGLCs and expressing O4 and myelin basic protein, two mature myelinating glial cell markers. The cells sent out processes to contact and wrap axons, an event that normally occurs during early stages of myelination, in the retina. The results suggest that CD90(+) hBMSCs are capable of morphological and functional differentiation into MGLCs in vivo through predifferentiation by triggering F3/Notch signaling in vitro. ©AlphaMed Press.

41149111284	Prolonged modulation of FGF-2 expression in astrocytic cultures induced by O,O′-diacetyl-apomorphine	Apomorphine (APO) is an anti-parkinsonian drug currently in use, which provides relief of Parkinson's symptoms. However, the utility of APO is greatly hampered by its poor bioavailability and rapid metabolism. In the present study, O,O′-diacetyl-apomorphine, a prodrug of apomorphine, was synthesized and its biological activity was examined. The prodrug induced fibroblast growth factor-2 production in astrocytic cultures similarly to apomorphine. However, its duration of action was significantly prolonged, and its resistance to oxidation was markedly enhanced compared to APO. O,O′-Diacetyl-apomorphine also induced MEK/MAPK signaling. These results suggest that O,O′-diacetyl-apomorphine can efficiently counteract oxidation and thereby enhance FGF-2 production in astrocytes. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

79952257969	Biocompatibility of silk fibroin with dog bone marrow stromal cells in vitro	Objective: To investigate the biocompatibility of dog bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in vitro with silk fibroin material and to explore the possibility of using silk fibroin as a novel material in the fabrication of tissue-engineered nerve scaffolds combined with the introduction of BMSCs. Methods: Dog bone marrow stromal cells were isolated from other cells by adherence to plastic. The dog BMSCs were then cultured on the substrate silk fibroin fibers and the cell attachment and growth observed using immunofluorescence light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The dog BMSCs were also cultured in the silk fibroin extract fluid. The cell ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy. MTT test was used to detect cell viability in different medium after 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours or 7 days in culture (n= 12 for each group). Flow cytometry was employed to detect BMSCs cell cycle and phenotypes (n =3). Results: BMSCs were tightly attached to the silk fibroin fibers and grew along the silk fibroin as demonstrated by immunofluorescence light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, some of which exhibited a spherical, oval or spindle shape. The results of transmission electron microscopy, MTT test and flow cytometry analysis showed that there were no significant morphological, cell viability, proliferation and phenotypes differences between BMSCs cultured in the silk fibroin extract fluid and those in plain IMDM medium. Conclusion: These data indicate that silk fibroin has good biocompatibility with BMSCs and does not exert any significant cytotoxic effects on their phenotype, thus it is a potential scaffold material combined with the introduction of BMSCs in the fabrication of tissue-engineered nerve.

80052905420	Repair of Rat Sciatic Nerve Gap by a Silk Fibroin-Based Scaffold Added with Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells	Tissue-engineered nerve grafts (TENGs), typically consisting of a neural scaffold included with support cells and/or growth factors, represent a promising alternative to autologous nerve grafts for surgical repair of large peripheral nerve gaps. Here, we developed a new design of TENGs by introducing bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of rats, as support cells, into a silk fibroin (SF)-based scaffold, which was composed of an SF nerve guidance conduit and oriented SF filaments as the conduit lumen filler. The biomaterial SF had been tested to possess good biocompatibility and noncytoxicity with MSCs before the TENG was implanted to bridge a 10-mm-long gap in rat sciatic nerve. Functional and histological assessments showed that at 12 weeks after nerve grafting, TENGs yielded an improved outcome of nerve regeneration and functional recovery, which was better than that achieved by SF scaffolds and close to that by autologous nerve grafts. During 1-4 weeks after nerve grafting, MSCs contained in the TENG significantly accelerated axonal growth, displaying a positive reaction to S-100 (a Schwann cell marker). During 1-3 weeks after nerve grafting, MSCs contained in the TENG led to gene expression upregulation of S100 and several growth factors (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor). These results suggest that the cell behaviors and neurotrophic functions of MSCs might be responsible for their promoting effects on peripheral nerve regeneration. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84861805931	Comparative proteomic analysis of differentially expressed proteins between peripheral sensory and motor nerves	Peripheral sensory and motor nerves have different functions and different approaches to regeneration, especially their distinct ability to accurately reinervate terminal nerve pathways. To understand the molecular aspects underlying these differences, the proteomics technique by coupling isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) with online two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) was used to investigate the protein profile of sensory and motor nerve samples from rats. A total of 1472 proteins were identified in either sensory or motor nerve. Of them, 100 proteins showed differential expressions between both nerves, and some of them were validated by quantitative real time RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. In the light of functional categorization, the differentially expressed proteins in sensory and motor nerves, belonging to a broad range of classes, were related to a diverse array of biological functions, which included cell adhesion, cytoskeleton, neuronal plasticity, neurotrophic activity, calcium-binding, signal transduction, transport, enzyme catalysis, lipid metabolism, DNA-binding, synaptosome function, actin-binding, ATP-binding, extracellular matrix, and commitment to other lineages. The relatively higher expressed proteins in either sensory or motor nerve were tentatively discussed in combination with their specific molecular characteristics. It is anticipated that the database generated in this study will provide a solid foundation for further comprehensive investigation of functional differences between sensory and motor nerves, including the specificity of their regeneration. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84861833687	Comparative proteomic analysis of primary schwann cells and a spontaneously immortalized schwann cell line RSC 96: A comprehensive overview with a focus on cell adhesion and migration related proteins	Schwann cells (SCs) are the principal glial cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). As a result of tissue heterogeneity and difficulties in the isolation and culture of primary SCs, a considerable understanding of SC biology is obtained from SC lines. However, the differences between the primary SCs and SC lines remain uncertain. In the present study, quantitative proteomic analysis based on isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling was conducted to obtain an unbiased view of the proteomic profiles of primary rat SCs and RSC96, a spontaneously immortalized rat SC line. Out of 1757 identified proteins (FDR < 1%), 1702 were quantified, while 61 and 78 were found to be, respectively, up- or down-regulated (90% confidence interval) in RSC96. Bioinformatics analysis indicated the unique features of spontaneous immortalization, illustrated the dedifferentiated state of RSC96, and highlighted a panel of novel proteins associated with cell adhesion and migration including CADM4, FERMT2, and MCAM. Selected proteomic data and the requirement of these novel proteins in SC adhesion and migration were properly validated. Taken together, our data collectively revealed proteome differences between primary SCs and RSC96, validated several differentially expressed proteins with potential biological significance, and generated a database that may serve as a useful resource for studies of SC biology and pathology. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84867820902	Repairing rat sciatic nerve injury by a nerve-growth-factor-loaded, chitosan-based nerve conduit	We have developed a nerve conduit made up of chitosan, on which nerve growth factor (NGF) was immobilized via genipin cross-linking. The nerve conduit was used to bridge a 10-mm-long sciatic nerve gap in rats. At 24 weeks after surgery, electrophysiological assessment, behavioral analysis, and histological examination were conducted to evaluate the outcomes of peripheral nerve repair. The nerve conduit allowed nerve reconstruction between two stumps and reinnervation of the target gastrocnemius muscle. For two groups of rats repaired respectively by the nerve conduit and autologous nerve graft, the density of regenerated axons was 3.55 ± 0.51 and 3.91 ± 0.14 (P = 0.712), and the cross-sectional area of target muscles was 1,159.68 ± 305.85 and 1,307.06 ± 301.25 (P = 0.922), respectively, without significant differences between the two groups. Our data suggest the feasibility of using chitosan-based, NGF-loaded nerve conduits for peripheral nerve repair. © 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84877725499	Early neurogenesis during caudal spinal cord regeneration in adult Gekko japonicus	Gekko japonicus undergoes dramatic changes in the caudal spinal cord after tail amputation. The amputation induces cell proliferation in the caudal ependymal tube. We performed hematoxylin and eosin staining at different time points in the regeneration process to investigate the morphological characterization of the regenerated appendages. The central canal extended to the blastema post-amputation and the cartilage and muscle tissue appeared 3 weeks after injury. We performed the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay to detect proliferating cells during the regeneration process. BrdU positive cells were detected in the peri-central canal. Furthermore, nestin and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) immunocytochemistry were applied to detect neural stem/progenitor cells and neurons. Two weeks after injury, nestin-positive cells undergoing proliferation were located outside of the ependymal tube, and NSE positive cells appeared after 3 weeks of amputation. These data suggest that neurogenesis is an early event during caudal spinal cord regeneration in gecko. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The light and electron micrographs demonstrated that the electrospun SF nanofibrous mat supported the survival and growth of the attached hippocampal neurons. MTT assay and immunocytochemistry in couple with Western blot analysis respectively indicated there was no significant difference in both the cell viability and expression levels of some proteins, including GAP-43, MAP-2, NF, and β-tubulin, between hippocampal neurons cultured in the electrospun SF nanofibrous mat extract and in plain neuronal medium. Our results indicated that electrospun SF nanofibrous mats were biocompatible to primary culture of hippocampal neurons without cytotoxic effects on the cell phenotype and functions, raising a potential possibility of using these mats for CNS therapeutic applications. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

42449089510	Adult rat bone marrow stromal cells differentiate into Schwann cell-like cells in vitro	Bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) have the capability of differentiating into mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal lineages. In this study, MSCs isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rats were cultured to proliferation, followed by in vitro induction under specific conditions. The results demonstrated that MSCs were transdifferentiated into cells with the Schwann cell (SC) phenotypes according to their morphology and immunoreactivities to SC surface markers including S-100, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p75). Consequently, rat adult MSCs can be induced in vitro to differentiate into SC-like cells, thus developing an abundant and accessible SC reservoir to meet the requirements of constructing tissue engineered nerve grafts for peripheral nerve repair. © 2007 The Society for In Vitro Biology.

52449105170	Polyglycolic acid filaments guide Schwann cell migration in vitro and in vivo	Nerve conduits filled with longitudinal aligned filaments have demonstrated a better regenerative outcome for bridging large peripheral nerve gaps than hollow nerve conduits. In the present study, we investigated the in vitro and in vitro cellular behavior of Schwann cells on polyglycolic acid (PGA) filaments by immunocyto/histochemistry and light/electron microscopy. After 1-3-week culture of rat dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) onto PGA filaments, Schwann cells from rat DRGs adhered to and migrated along PGA filaments. Twenty-four rats received implantation of chitosan conduits inserted with PGA filaments to bridge 10-mm-long sciatic nerve gaps. At 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks post-implantation (n = 6, each time point), Schwann cells were found to migrate along PGA filaments and form cell columns resembling bands of Büngner. These results suggest that PGA filaments may play a contact guidance role in Schwann cell migration and thus serve as a promising conduit-filling material to facilitate peripheral nerve repair. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Methods: The serial transversal sections of rat's spinal cord were made and mounted directly, then stained with Luxol fast blue(LFB) and their images were taken. The section images were registered, segmented and changed into gray-scale images under the Photoshop circumstance. 3D-DOCTOR software was used to make threshold segmentation and to reconstruct the spinal cord, grey matter and bilateral corticospinal tracts of rat. The reconstructed structures were observed at random angles, dissected and measured on a common desktop. Results: The reconstructed spinal cord, grey matter, bilateral corticospinal tracts of rat were solid. In C1 to S4 segments of rat's spinal cord, the corticospinal tracts lay in the posterior funiculus and were close to the back of intermediate zone, appearing as gradually narrowing columns. Conclusion: The corticospinal tracts in rat's spinal cord can be reconstructed and offer survey data by using serial LFB stained spinal cord sections and computerized three dimensional reconstruction technique.

55349109231	Salidroside attenuates glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death in primary cultured hippocampal neurons of rats	Salidroside, a compound of natural origin, has displayed a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties. This study aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of salidroside on glutamate-induced cell death in a primary culture of rat hippocampal neurons as compared to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a usual positive control. MTT and LDH assays, together with Hoechst 33342 staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-mediated nicked end labeling (TUNEL) assay and flow cytometric analysis using annexin-V and propidium (PI) label, indicated that salidroside pretreatment attenuated glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death in primary cultured hippocampal neurons, showing a dose-dependent pattern. Furthermore, caspase-3 activity assay and calcium measurements with Fluo 4-AM, respectively, revealed that salidroside pretreatment antagonized activation of caspase-3 and elevation of intracellular calcium level, both of which were induced by glutamate stimulation, thus adding to the understanding of how salidroside offered neuroprotection against glutamate excitotoxicity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

54549111959	The protective effects of Achyranthes bidentata polypeptides against NMDA-induced cell apoptosis in cultured hippocampal neurons through differential modulation of NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDA receptors	Achyranthes bidentata Blume is a commonly prescribed Chinese medicinal herb with a variety of pharmaceutical properties. From its aqueous extract we have separated important constituents, referred to as A. bidentata polypeptides (ABPP). In this study, the neuroprotective effect of ABPP against N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced cell apoptosis was investigated in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The results of MTT assay, Hoechst/PI double staining and DNA ladder detection indicated that ABPP significantly attenuated, in a concentration-dependent manner, apoptotic cell damage induced by exposure of cultured hippocampal neurons to NMDA (100 μM) for 30 min. The intracellular calcium measurement with fluo-3/AM revealed that ABPP antagonized the excess intracellular calcium triggered by NMDA. Furthermore, in addition to inhibiting the action of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors, ABPP can enhance the function of NR2A-containing NMDA receptors. Our data might suggest that ABPP may also prove to be a potential neuroprotective therapy owing to its differential modulation of NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDA receptors. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

57449116650	Neuroprotective effects of salidroside in the PC12 cell model exposed to hypoglycemia and serum limitation	The hypoglycemia and serum limitation-induced cell death in cultured PC12 cells represents a useful in vitro model for the study of brain ischemia and neurodegenerative disorders. Salidroside is a phenylpropanoid glycoside isolated from Rhodiola rosea L., a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, and has displayed a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties. In this study, MTT assay, Hoechst 33342 staining, and flow cytometry with annexin V/PI staining collectively showed that pretreatment with salidroside attenuated, in a dose-dependent manner, cell viability loss, and apoptotic cell death in cultured PC12 cells induced by hypoglycemia and serum limitation. RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and enzymatic colorimetric assay indicated the changes in expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase3 in PC12 cells on exposure to hypoglycemia and serum limitation with and without salidroside pretreatment, respectively. Rhodamine 123 staining and flow cytometry with 2′,7′- Dichlorofluorescin diacetate staining revealed the changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential and radical oxygen species (ROS) production in PC12 cells on exposure to hypoglycemia and serum limitation with and without salidroside pretreatment, respectively. The experimental results suggest that salidroside protects the PC12 cells against hypoglycemia and serum limitation-induced cytotoxicity possibly by the way of the modulation of apoptosis-related gene expression, the restoration of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and the inhibition of the intracellular ROS production. Our findings might raise a possibility of potential therapeutic applications of salidroside for preventing and treating cerebral ischemic and neurodegenerative diseases. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

57649134248	Increased dosage of Dyrk1A alters alternative splicing factor (ASF)-regulated alternative splicing of tau in down syndrome	Two groups of tau, 3R- and 4R-tau, are generated by alternative splicing of tau exon 10. Normal adult human brain expresses equal levels of them. Disruption of the physiological balance is a common feature of several tauopathies. Very early in their life, individuals with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer-type tau pathology, the molecular basis for which is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that Dyrk1A, a kinase encoded by a gene in the DS critical region, phosphorylates alternative splicing factor (ASF) at Ser-227, Ser-234, and Ser-238, driving it into nuclear speckles and preventing it from facilitating tau exon 10 inclusion. The increased dosage of Dyrk1A in DS brain due to trisomy of chromosome 21 correlates to an increase in 3R-tau level, which on abnormal hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau results in neurofibrillary degeneration. Imbalance of 3R- and 4R-tau in DS brain by Dyrk1A-induced dysregulation of alternative splicing factor-mediated alternative splicing of tau exon 10 represents a novel mechanism of neurofibrillary degeneration and may help explain early onset tauopathy in individuals with DS. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

57049090567	Ultrastructure analysis of human neural stem cells/progenitors cultivated in vitro	Objective: Neural stem cells have become a major concern in the current research of neuroscience, for they are involved in the neural injuries and recoveries, the origin of neural tumors, as well as other fields. The study on their ultrastructures, which is still limited at present, is indispensible. To offer more information is the aim of this paper. Methods: Neural stem cells/progenitors from human fetal brain tissue were cultivated in vitro and observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Results: Neural stem cells/progenitors presented to be neurosphere-like after days of culture in vitro. The neurospheres were made up of neural stem cells/progenitors and nonfixiform material inside, and cells in neurospheres could be divided into lucent and dark ones according to electron densities. Between adjacent cells as well as on the cytoplasmic sides of the apposed plasma membranes, there were vesicle-like structures. Cell membrane fusions were, also observed between some adjacent cells. Single neural stem cell/progenitor was spherical with rough surface under SEM. Many kinds of organellas, e. g. Golgi' s complex and endocytoplasmic reticulum, were underdeveloped in neural stem cells/progenitors, which generally had big, nuclei and scanty cytoplasm. The numbers, types and maturities of cellular organs in different cells were not always identical, which showed their heterogeneities. For instance, both neurofilaments and microtubules could only be observed in a few neural stem cells/progenitors; lysosomes were very abundant in some, but even hardly founded in others. What's more, autophagosomes at different stages and in differernt formations could be seen in most cells. The nuclei, frenquently containing huge amounts of euchromatin and a small quantity of heterochromatin, mostly were globular, sometimes reniform or lobulated; most neural stem cells/ progenitors had only one chromatospherite, seldom two or more, and sometimes no obvious chromatospherite could be seen. Conclusion: Developed autophagosomes, vesicle-like structures between adjacent cells as well as on the cytoplasmic sides of the apposed plasma membranes and cellular membrane fusions could be seen in the human embryo-originated neural stem cells/progenitors and neurospheres, which could be the main subjects in the ultrastructure studies of brain tumor stem cell.

58149189393	The molecular characterization of the brain protein 44-like (Brp44l) gene of Gekko japonicus and its expression changes in spinal cord after tail amputation	The cDNA encoding brain protein 44-like (Brp44l) was identified from the brain and spinal cord cDNA library of Gekko japonicus. It contains a 324 bp open reading frame corresponding to a deduced protein of 107 amino acids. The molecular weight of the BRP44L protein is 12.2664 kDa and its theoretical pI is 9.67. At amino acid level, the BRP44L from gecko shares 85-89% similarity with those from other species. Northern blotting showed that Brp44l was ubiquitously expressed in the major organs of Gekko japonicus including brain, spinal cord, heart, lung, liver, and kidney, suggesting a fundamental biological role of this gene. In situ hybridization (ISH) revealed that positive hybridization signals were present in gray matter of spinal cord. The change of Brp44l expression in spinal cord after tail amputation was examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression level of this gene increased in the spinal cord after tail amputation, and reached the highest value at 1 week after tail amputation, which indicated that the expression level of Brp44l might be associated with the process of spinal cord injury and regeneration. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

In situ hybridization (ISH) revealed that positive hybridization signals were present in both gray matter and white matter of the spinal cord. The change of PDGF-C expression in the spinal cord after tail amputation was examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. The expression of PDGF-C in the spinal cord showed highest level at 1 day after tail amputation, and gradually decreased until 2 weeks, which indicated that the expression level of PDGF-C might be associated with the process of spinal cord injury and regeneration. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Chitosan can be degraded in vivo into chitooligosaccharide. We have investigated the in vitro effects of chitooligosaccharide on neuronal differentiation of PC-12 cells to see what effects chitooligosaccharide have on certain functions in the regenerating neurons. The morphologic observation and assessment using the specific reagent of tetrazolium salt WST-8 indicated that neurite outgrowths from PC-12 cells and the viability of PC-12 cells were enhanced by treatment of chitooligosaccharide. The real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed showed that chitooligosaccharide could upregulate the expression of neurofilament-H mRNA or protein and N-cadherin protein in PC-12 cells. The maximum effect of 0.1 mg/ml chitooligosaccharide was obtained after 2 week culture. All the data suggest that chitooligosaccharide possesses good nerve cell affinity by supporting nerve cell adhesion and promoting neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth. © 2009 International Federation for Cell Biology.

Methods: BMSCs were typically isolated from other cells by adherence to plastic. The mice-derived bone marrow stromal cells were cultured on the substrate of silk fibroin fibers and the cell attachment and growth during culture was observed by using light and electron microscopy. Mice-derived BMSCs were also cultured in the silk fibroin extract fluid. The cell ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy. MTT test was used to detect cell viability in different media for 12, 24, 48, 72 hours and 7 days respectively (the test was repeated 12 times for each group). Flow cytometry was employed to detect BMSCs cell cycle and phenotypes (the test was repeated 3 times). Results: BMSCs cells were tightly attached to the silk fibroin fibers and grew along the silk fibroin fibers; some of them enwrapped the silk fibroin fibers and they exhibited either a spherical or spindle shape. The results of transmission electron microscopy, MTT test and flow cytometry analysis showed that there was no significant difference between BMSCs cultured in the silk fibroin extract fluid and those in plain IMDM medium in their morphology, cell viability, proliferation and phenotypes. Conclusion: These data indicate that silk fibroin has good biocompatibility with BMSCs and is also beneficial to the survival of BMSCs without exerting any significant cytotoxic effects on their phenotype; thus it' s a potential scaffold material to fabricate tissue-engineered nerve with introduction of BMSCs.

Methods: After 50 Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to nerve suture after transaction, they were randomly divided into 5 groups for daily intragastric administration of drugs: NGG high-dose (5.2g/kg), medium-dose (2.6g/kg), low-dose (1.3g/kg) groups, mecobalamin group (positive control) at 625 μg/kg, control group (control group control). The drug administration lasted for 4 weeks. Footprint test was performed 2-, 3- and 4- weeks after surgery to evaluate toe spread function (TSF). Electrophysiology was performed 4 weeks after operation to determine the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and nerve action potential (NAP). The number of regenerated myelinated nerve fibers, thickness of myelin sheath and cross sectional area of tibial muscle were measured by histomorphology. Results: TSF, amplitude and recovery rate of CMAP and NAP, the number of regenerated myelinated nerve fibers, thickness of myelin sheath and section area of tibial muscle were all increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control group. Conclusion: NGG contributes to axon growth and myelination, and thus promotes peripheral nerve regeneration in rats with functional recovery.

63449104011	The promotion of peripheral nerve regeneration by chitooligosaccharides in the rat nerve crush injury model	Chitooligosaccharides (COSs), the biodegradation product of chitosan, have shown many biological functions. In this study, we examined the possible benefits of treatment with COSs (M.W. 800) on regeneration of rat crushed sciatic nerves. The rats with sciatic nerve crush injury were administered intraperitoneally daily with 3 or 6 mg/kg body weight of COSs over a 3-week period. During and at the end of COSs treatment, a series of functional and histological examinations, including the measurement of withdrawal reflex latency (WRL) values, walking track analysis, electrophysiological assessments, morphometric analysis of gastrocnemius muscle, as well as immunohistochemistry and electromicroscopy to regenerated sciatic nerves, were performed to evaluate the therapeutic outcomes of COSs. The experimental data demonstrated that COSs promoted peripheral nerve regeneration with the desired functional recovery in the rat sciatic nerve crush injury model. This study raises a possibility of developing COSs as a potential neuroprotective agent for peripheral nerve repair applications. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

62249140947	Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells promote cell proliferation and neurotrophic function of Schwann cells in vitro and in vivo	The use of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in nerve tissue engineering leads to an improved functional outcome of peripheral nerve repair. Schwann cells (SCs) are primary structural and functional cells in peripheral nervous system and play a crucial role in peripheral nerve regeneration. We hypothesize that MSCs promote peripheral nerve regeneration not only via their direct release of neurotrophic factors, but through indirect modulation of cellular behaviors of SCs. To test this hypothesis we investigated the influences of MSCs on proliferation of and neurotrophic factor expression by SCs using an in vitro co-culture model and an in vivo system of rat sciatic nerve regeneration. The data from cell viability assay and flow cytometry, bromodeoxyuridine/Hoechst 33342 double staining, immunocyto/histochemistry, RT-PCR and quantitative real-time RT-PCR, as well as Western blot analysis collectively confirmed the effects of MSCs on the biological characteristics of SCs, especially during the period of peripheral nerve regeneration. Our results help to elucidate the mechanisms by which MSCs function as a cell therapy agent in peripheral nerve repair. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

63049111160	Preparation and application of rat myostatin antiserum	Objective: To prepare and identify a polyclonal antibody against rat myostatin and investigate myostatin expression in the rat atrophic gastrocnemius muscle after tibial nerve crush. Methods: The purified fusion protein was used as antigen to immunize rabbits for the preparation of polyclonal antibody. The polyclonal antibody of the protein was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western-blot and immunochemistry. Myostatin protein expression levels in normal and atrophic gastrocnemius muscle were detected by western-blot and immunochemistry assays. Results: The GST-myostatin had a purity of 96% and possessed high titer and specificity. The level of myostatin in gastrocnemius muscle significantly increased one week after tibial nerve crush, reached the peak on day 14, and then returned to normal level on day 28. Conclusion: We have successfully made antiserum of rat myostatin and found that the expression level of myostatin protein in the gastrocnemius after tibial nerve crush-induced atrophy was time-dependent. This study provides an experimental basis to clarify the possible role of myostatin during skeletal muscle atrophy. © 2009 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

63049129825	Protein expression profile in the differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells into Schwann cell-like cells	During the last decade, increasing evidence suggested that bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) have the potential to differentiate into neural lineages. Many studies have reported that MSCs showed morphological changes and expressed a limited number of neural proteins under experimental conditions. However, no proteomic studies on MSCs differentiated into Schwann cell-like cells have been reported. In this study, we isolated MSCs from adult Sprague-Dawley rat femur and tibia bone marrows and induced the cells in vitro under specific conditions. By using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), we compared the protein profiles of MSCs before and after induced differentiation. We obtained 792 protein spots in the protein profile by 2-DE, and found that 74 spots changed significantly before and after the differentiation using PDQuest software, with 43 up-regulated and 31 down-regulated. We analyzed these 74 spots by a matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and by database searching, and found that they could be grouped into various classes, including cytoskeleton and structure proteins, growth factors, metabolic proteins, chaperone proteins, receptor proteins, cell cycle proteins, calcium binding proteins, and other proteins. These proteins also include neural and glial proteins, such as BDNF, CNTF and GFAP. The results may provide valuable proteomic information about the differentiation of MSCs into Schwann cell-like cells. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

67349137059	Achyranthes bidentata Blume extract promotes neuronal growth in cultured embryonic rat hippocampal neurons	We have prepared an aqueous extract of Achyranthes bidentata Blume, a commonly prescribed Chinese medicinal herb, and reported, in previous studies, that A. bidentata extract benefits nerve growth and prevents neuron apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the actions of A. bidentata extract on survival and growth of primarily cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The morphological observation revealed that neurite growth from hippocampal neurons was significantly enhanced by A. bidentata extract with similar effects to those induced by nerve growth factor (NGF), and the greatest neurite growth appeared on treatment with A. bidentata extract at 1 μg/ml for 24 h. DNA microarray analysis indicated that there were 25 upregulated genes and 47 downregulated genes exhibiting significantly differential expression in hippocampal neurons treated with A. bidentata extract at 1 μg/ml for 6 h when compared to those in untreated hippocampal neurons. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that the expression of growth-associated protein-43 in hippocampal neurons was upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels after treatment with A. bidentata extract, and the optimal dosage of the extract was also 1μg/ml. These data confirm that A. bidentata extract could promote in vitro hippocampal neuronal growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner.©2009 National Natural Science Foundation of China and Chinese Academy of Sciences.

67849132403	Chitosan/polyglycolic acid nerve grafts for axon regeneration from prolonged axotomized neurons to chronically denervated segments	Peripheral nerve regeneration for long-term delayed injuries is usually unsatisfied. Here we attempted to use a chitosan/polyglycolic acid (PGA) artificial nerve graft to bridge a long-term delayed 10-mm defect in SD rats based on the previous studies on the graft used for immediate repair of 30-mm-long dog sciatic nerve defects and for clinical treatment of a 35-mm-long median nerve defect at elbow of a human patient. In this study, for experimental groups, the rat sciatic nerve had been transected leaving a 10-mm defect, which was maintained for 3 or 6 months before implantation with the chitosan/PGA artificial nerve graft. The animals non-grafted or grafted with autograft served as negative or positive control group. In experiment groups, nerve regeneration with functional recovery was achieved as measured by electrophysiological and histological techniques, although differences in the quantity and the quality of the regenerated nerve were observed between the 3- and 6-month delayed subgroups. The results showed that: (1) a few denervated Schwann cells survived and sustained their ability to myelinate axons at least 6 months, and (2) the atrophic denervated muscle could be reinnervated by regenerated axons through new muscle-nerve connections. These observations provide the possibility of guiding regenerated axons from survived axotomized neurons to distal nerve stump by the chitosan/PGA artificial nerve graft. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

69749088620	Three-dimensional reconstruction of human spinal cord based on histological serial sections	Background: It is not possible to reconstruct the inner structure of the spinal cord, such as gray matter and spinal tracts, from the Visual Human Project database or CT and MRI databases, due to low image resolution and contrast in macrosection images. Objective: To explore a semi-automatic computerized three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of human spinal cord based on histological serial sections, in order to solve issues such as low contrast. Design, time and setting: An experimental study combining serial section techniques and 3D reconstruction, performed in the laboratory of Human Anatomy and Histoembryology at the Medical School of Nantong University during January to April 2008. Setting: Department of Anatomy, Institute of Neurobiology, Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Neural Regeneration, Laboratory of Image Engineering. Materials: A human lumbar spinal cord segment from fresh autopsy material of an adult male. Methods: After 4% paraformaldehyde fixation for three days, serial sections of the lumbar spinal cord were cut on a Leica cryostat and mounted on slides in sequence, with eight sections aligned separately on each slide. All sections were stained with Luxol Fast Blue to reveal myelin sheaths. After gradient dehydration and clearing, the stained slides were coverslipped. Sections were observed and images recorded under a light microscope using a digital camera. Six images were acquired at x25 magnification and automatically stitched into a complete section image. After all serial images were obtained, 96 complete serial images of the human lumbar cord segment were automatically processed with "Curves", "Autocontrast", "Gray scale 8 bit", "Invert", "Image resize to 50%" steps using Photoshop 7.0 software. All images were added in order into 3D-DOCTOR 4.0 software as a stack, where serial images were automatically realigned with neighboring images and semi-automatically segmented for white matter and gray matter. Finally, simple surface and volume reconstruction were completed on a personal computer. The reconstructed human lumbar spinal cord segment was interactively observed, cut, and measured. Main outcome measures: The reconstructed human lumbar spinal cord segment. Results: Compared with serial images obtained from other image modalities, such as CT, MRI, and macrosections from The Visual Human Project database, the Luxol Fast Blue stained histological serial section images exhibited higher resolution and contrast between gray and white matter. Image processing and 3D reconstruction steps were semi-automatically performed with related software. The 3D reconstructed human lumbar cord segment were observed, cut, and measured on a PC. Conclusion: A semi-automatically computerized method, based on histological serial sections, is an effective way to 3D-reconstruct the human spinal cord.

68349124960	Effects of Bone Marrow Stromal Cell-conditioned Medium on Primary Cultures of Peripheral Nerve Tissues and Cells	Implantation of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) produces an improved functional outcome of peripheral nerve repair. In this study, rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants, rat DRG neurons, and rat Schwann cells (SCs) were treated with monkey MSC-conditioned medium, respectively, and then subjected to MTT assay, Bromodeoxyuridine/Hoechst 33342 double staining, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative PCR, and Western blot analysis, respectively. The results showed that MSC-conditioned medium enhanced axon growth and neurogenesis in cultured DRG explants, augmented cell survival of and expression of NF and GAP-43 by cultured DRG neurons, promoted cell survival and proliferation of cultured SCs, and increased the expression of NGF, BDNF, and bFGF in cultured SCs. We also found that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) 1/2 pathway was involved in the enhanced cell proliferation of SCs evoked by MSC-conditioned medium. The data of this study might help the understanding of MSCs-based treatment for peripheral nerve repair. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

70349292798	Evaluation on in vitro biocompatibility of silk fibroin-based biomaterials with primarily cultured hippocampal neurons	Silk fibroin-based biomaterials have recently found increasing applications in the tissue-engineering field including the generation of artificial nerve guides for peripheral nerve repair. The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of silk fibroin as a candidate biomaterial for central nervous system (CNS) therapy. We found that substrates made up of silk fibroin fibers supported the survival and growth of the attached hippocampal neurons by using morphological observation. We also cultured the hippocampal neurons in silk fibroin extract for different times, and observed no significant difference occurring in their morphology, cell viability for these cultured hippocampal neurons as compared to those cultured in plain neuronal culture medium. Moreover, immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis revealed that no significant difference was found in mRNA or protein levels of the growth-associated molecules, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, growth-associated protein-43, neurofilament, nerve growth factor, and nerve growth factor-receptor P75, between the hippocampal neurons cultured in the silk fibroin extract and in plain neuronal culture medium. Taken together, all the results demonstrate that silk fibroin has good biocompatibility with primarily cultured hippocampal neurons without any significant cytotoxic effects on their cell phenotype and functions, suggesting a potential possible use of silk fibroin for preparing the tissue-engineered nerve guides or drug delivery vehicles to treat CNS injuries or diseases. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

70349968034	Molecular cloning and altered expression of Pbx4 in the spinal cord during tail regeneration of Gekko japonicus	Transcription factor Pbx4 is recruited to form dimeric or trimeric complexes with Hox and/or Meis homeodomain proteins and participates in patterning the hindbrain and retina during vertebrate CNS development. We characterized a Pbx4 cDNA isolated from a Gekko japonicus brain and spinal cord cDNA library. Northern blot and quantitative real-time PCR revealed that gecko Pbx4 was ubiquitously expressed in several tissues. In the spinal cord after tail amputation, in situ hybridization results showed that Pbx4 mRNA staining was present in the gray matter and ependymal cells of the spinal cord but that additional staining was seen in the white matter in regions close to the amputation stump. Both in situ hybridization and real-time PCR methods detected no obvious changes in Pbx4 expression in segment of the cord farthest from the amputation site, however, Pbx4 mRNA expression increased by 2 fold in segment close to the amputation site after 2 wks. The upregulation of Pbx4 was inhibited by an intraperitoneal injection of retinoic acid (RA) (100 μg/g body weight). These results suggest that gecko Pbx4 is possibly involved in spinal cord regeneration at sites of proximal amputation, and that the expression of Pbx4 in the spinal cord is regulated by retinoic acid in a manner different from that of Pbx1, Pbx2 and Pbx3. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

70350622706	Microelectronics-embedded channel bridging and signal regeneration of injured spinal cords	Due to the difficulty in spinal cord regeneration with biological methods, the microelectronic neural bridge, a new concept based on microelectronic technology, is presented. The microelectronic system has been realized in the forms of hybrid and integrated circuits. The integrated circuits for neural signal detection, stimulation, and regeneration are realized in a CMOS process. In animal experiments with 100 toads, 48 rats, and 3 rabbits, nerve signals have been successfully detected from spinal cords and sciatic nerves, and functional electrical stimulation has been carried out for spinal cords and sciatic nerves. When the microelectronic system is bridged between the controlling and stimulated nerve, the relevant motion of legs and nerve signal waveforms, which are stimulated by the evoked or spontaneous nerve signal through such a system, have been observed. Therefore, the feasibility of the presented method was demonstrated. © 2009 National Natural Science Foundation of China and Chinese Academy of Sciences.

70449526439	Degradation behaviors of nerve guidance conduits made up of silk fibroin in vitro and in vivo	We have developed a new design of nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) made up of silk fibroin (SF), referred to as SF-NGCs, by a well-established method. The present study aimed to comprehensively investigate the degradation behaviors of SF-NGCs versus SF fibers. After they were allowed to incubate in the protease XIV solution or to be subcutaneously implanted in rabbits, SF-NGCs and SF fibers were subjected to degradation level measurement, mass loss assessment and gel electrophoresis, or light and electron microscopy and mass loss assessment for testing the dynamic course of in vitro or in vivo degradation. The results collectively indicated that SF-NGCs were able to degrade at a significantly increasing rate as compared to SF fibers, thus meeting the requirements of peripheral nerve regeneration. Furthermore, based on the possible involvement pathway in the in vivo degradation of SF-NGCs, the time-dependent changes in the mRNA level of lysosome-related genes (Hip1R, cathepsin D, and tPA) in subcutaneous implantation site within 24-week period post-implantation was determined by real-time RT-PCR, and the resulting data might contribute to our understanding of the molecular aspects that affect in vivo degradation and absorption of SF-NGCs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We determined the time-dependent expression alterations of 107 protein spots, among which 53 protein spots were identified. These identified proteins included skeletal contractile proteins, metabolic enzymes, chaperone, intermediate filament, and signal transduction proteins. The time-dependent expression of three proteins, such as Mylpf, desmin, and RKIP, was confirmed by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. The functional implication of these expression changes was also discussed. We further analyzed the linkage and interactions among the differentially expressed proteins (MAPK1, RKIP, AHSG, etc.). Collectively, the results might add to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating postnatal growth and development of rat tibialis anterior muscle. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

71349083272	The protective effects of Achyranthes bidentata polypeptides in an experimental model of mouse sciatic nerve crush injury	We have separated the active polypeptides from aqueous extracts of Achyranthes bidentata Blume (ABPP), a commonly prescribed Chinese medicinal plant with a range of pharmaceutical properties. We investigated the effects of ABPP administration on peripheral nerve regeneration in a mouse sciatic nerve crush injury model. After nerve crush, the mice received daily tail vein injections of 1, 4, and 16 mg/kg of ABPP, 65 μg/kg of methylcobalamin, and vehicle saline, respectively, over a 21-day period. At 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 days after nerve crush, the animals were subjected to walking track analysis for evaluating the sciatic functional index (SFI) values. At day 21 the animals were anesthetized, and the compound muscle action potential and nerve conduction velocity were respectively recorded. After the animals were killed, the sciatic nerve was examined with immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, and gastrocnemius muscle was analyzed with Masson trichome staining. The results indicated that treatment with ABPP at a dose range (1-16 mg/kg) promoted histological regeneration and functional recovery of the injured sciatic nerve and its target muscle, yielding a desired efficacy greater than that by vehicle treatment and close to that by methylcobalamin (65 μg/kg). These findings suggest that plant polypeptides, ABPP, may be a potential agent in ameliorating of neuropathy caused by sciatic nerve crush. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: The cell activity of rat hippocampal, neurons with ABPP was tested with MTT. After 24 hours of incubation with different concentrations (0.1 mg/L, 0.5 mg/L, 1.0 mg/L) of ABPP, the hippocampal neurons were photographed by TCS SP2 confocal microscope with fluorescent immunocytochemistry, and the neurite length was analyzed using the Image-Pro Express software. Real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR was performed to examine the mRNA levels of GAP-43 and NF-H after 6 hour with different concentrations of ABPP. Western blotting was performed to further examine the protein levels of GAP-43 and NF-H in cultured hippocampal neurons after 24 hours incubation with different concentrations of ABPP. Results: ABPP promoted the neurite growth of cultured hippocampal neurons. Real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR showed that the mRNA level of GAP-43 and NF-H in cultured hippocampal neurons was up-regulated by ABPP in a dose dependent manner. Meanwhile, fluorescent immunocytochemistry and Western blotting showed that the protein level of GAP-43 and NF-H were up-regulated by ABPP. Conclusion: ABPP could promote the neurite growth and modulate the expression of GAP-43 and NF-H in cultured hippocampal neurons, which maybe have something to do with ERK pathway.

73249147472	Chitooligosaccharides promote peripheral nerve regeneration in a rabbit common peroneal nerve crush injury model	Chitooligosaccharides (COSs) are the biodegradation products of chitosan that have been demonstrated with neuroaffinity and/or neuroprotective actions. In this study, we investigated the possible benefits of treatment with COSs on nerve regeneration after crush injuries to peripheral nerves. The rabbits with the crushed common peroneal nerve were treated by daily intravenous injection of 1.5 or 3 mg/kg body weight of COSs or identical volume of saline (as the control) for a 6-week period. At the end of COSs treatment, electrophysiological assessments, Meyer's trichrome and Masson trichrome staining, and transmission electron microscopy were used to evaluate the regeneration of injured common peroneal nerve and atrophy of the tibialis posterior muscle. The results showed that the compound muscle action potentials, the number of regenerated myelinated nerve fibers, the thickness of regenerated myelin sheaths, and the cross-sectional area of tibialis posterior muscle fibers were significantly improved in the nerves that received COSs treatment and the results with COSs treatment displayed a dose-dependent pattern. This study demonstrated that COSs accelerated peripheral nerve regeneration after crush injury to rabbit common peroneal nerves. The COSs could probably become a potential neuroprotective agent for improvement of peripheral nerve regeneration after the injury and deserve for further studies. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

72749099061	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of evolutionarily conserved stathmin from Gekko japonicus spinal cord	The cDNA encoding stathmin is identified from the brain and spinal cord cDNA library of Gekko japonicus. It contains a 450 bp open-reading-frame, corresponding to a deduced protein of 149 amino acids. At amino acid level, gecko stathmin shares more than 76.4% identities with vertebrate stathmins, and especially, it shares 100% identity with human stathmin, suggesting that the selective pressure must have been extremely high for the conservation of stathmin during the vertebrates including reptile evolution. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) shows that gecko stathmin is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined. In situ hybridization reveals that stathmin transcript mainly appear in the gray matter of spinal cord. The change of stathmin expression in spinal cord after tail amputation is examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Stathmin expression increases at 1 day and 3 day after amputation and decreases to the control level at 1 week. However, the expression level increases again at 2 weeks. These suggest that stathmin may be associated with the immune protection of the injury, as well as in the regeneration of spinal cord.

73949089139	Achyranthes bidentata polypeptides confer neuroprotection through inhibition of reactive oxygen species production, bax expression, and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by overstimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors	Achyranthes bidentata polypeptides (ABPP), the important constituents separated from the aqueous extract of Achyranthes bidentata, have been shown to attenuate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced cell apoptosis in cultured hippocampal neurons through differential modulation of NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDA receptors. The present study sought to investigate the possible mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of ABPP on NMDA-induced cell death. Western blot analysis and colorimetric enzymatic assay demonstrated that ABPP pretreatment inhibited NMDA-induced increase of Bax protein expression or caspase-3 activity in cultured hippocampal neurons. Fluorescence measurements after staining with 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and rhodamine 123 showed that ABPP treatment also reversed NMDA-induced intracellular radical oxygen species (ROS) elevation and mitochondrial membrane potential depression in cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the in vivo effects of ABPP on cerebral neuronal damage during focal ischemia-reperfusion were also investigated. In rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, ABPP attenuated the increase in the neurological deficit and cerebral infarction induced by focal ischemia-reperfusion, showing in vivo neuroprotective effects. The results collectively suggest that ABPP might exert neuroprotective actions through inhibiting Bax protein expression, caspase-3 activity, ROS production, and mitochondrial dysfunction that are all caused by overstimulation of NMDA receptors. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

75749093936	The delayed repair of sciatic nerve defects with tissue-engineered nerve grafts in rats	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using tissue-engineered nerve grafts for delayed repair of peripheral nerve defects. A 1-month delayed, 10-mm long sciatic nerve defect was created for rats, which were divided into three grafted groups and a non-grafted group. For bridging the nerve defects, the rats in three grafted groups were subjected to surgical repair with tissue-engineered nerve grafts made of a chitosan/polyglycolic acid (PGA) conduit filled with neural stem cells (NSCs), chitosan/PGA conduits, and autologous nerve grafts, respectively. At 3 months after nerve grafting, the data from electrophysiology, retrograde tracing and histological investigation revealed that the better outcomes in sciatic nerve regeneration and target muscle re-innervation were achieved in three grafted groups as compared to those in non-grafted group without major differences between three grafted groups. Our results suggest that grafting of chitosan/PGA conduits might be a promising technique for repairing peripheral nerve injuries after a 1-month delay, while introduction of NSCs seem to show no significant additional benefits to regenerative outcomes. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.

Therefore, transplantation of induced bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that can secrete S100 may provide a beneficial microenvironment for neural regeneration. OBJECTIVE: To explore the changes in S100 expression during rat MSCs differentiation into Schwann cells in vitro. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: This cytology experiment was performed at the Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University in China, from January 2006 to May 2007.

77950187362	Neurotrophic actions of bone marrow stromal cells on primary culture of dorsal root ganglion tissues and neurons	Application of adult bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) provides therapeutic benefits to the treatment of neurological insults. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of nonhematopoietic BMSCs to produce soluble factors and stimulate signaling pathways in neurons that mediate trophic effects. A combination of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry showed that the BMSCs released into the culture medium an array of soluble factors such as nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and ciliary neurotrophic factor, which have been shown to exhibit potent neurotrophic effects on neural cells. Immunochemistry, cell viability assay, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR collectively showed that neurite outgrowth and neurogenesis in cultured rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants and neurons were enhanced after they were cocultured with rat BMSCs. Western blot analysis revealed that BMSC-conditioned medium activated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and/or phosphoinositide 3-kinase/serine/threonine kinase (PI3K/Akt) in primary culture of rat DRG neurons, which suggested that BMSCs trigger endogenous survival signaling pathways in neurons through their secreted soluble factors. Our data help to elucidate the mechanisms by which BMSCs function as a cell therapy agent in peripheral nerve regeneration. © 2009 Humana Press.

77955637656	Glioma stem cells involved in tumor tissue remodeling in a xenograft model: Laboratory investigation	Object. Although tissue remodeling plays a crucial role in the tumorigenesis and progression of human gliomas, its mechanisms remain largely uncertain. In the current study, the authors investigated the potential role of human glioma stem cells (hGSCs) in the tissue remodeling of gliomas. Methods. Transgenic nude mice with ubiquitous green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression were obtained by crossing nontransgenic NC athymic nude mice with the GFP transgenic C57BL/6J mice. As a result, GFP was expressed in essentially all tissues in the offspring. Human glioma stem cells were then orthotopically implanted into the GFP nude mice in an effort to assess the hGSC - host brain interactions and thereby elucidate the roles of tissue remodeling during tumorigenesis and progression of human gliomas. Results. All of the essential tissues in the GFP transgenic nude mice, including the brain, fluoresced green under an excitation light; therefore, tumor remodeling by hGSCs can be unambiguously distinguished from a bright green background composed of adjacent host GFP-expressing components. This technique enabled the authors to address the following concerns: 1) hGSCs were involved in the invasiveness of gliomas and adjacent stroma degradation of the host. 2) An in vivo study demonstrated that cell fusion occurred between hGSCs and host cells. 3) Vasculogenic mimicry - the formation of patterned, tubular networks of vascular channels by transdifferentiated hGSCs - could be observed. 4) Differentiation mimicry - namely, the differentiation direction of hGSCs bearing multidifferentiation potentials - seemed to be decided by the local host cellular microenviroment. Conclusions. The results of this study indicated that the GFP transgenic nude mice model with GFP expression in essentially all tissues could be obtained by crossing nontransgenic athymic nude mice with transgenic GFP mice. This model should greatly expand our knowledge of glioma-host interactions. The data indicated that hGSCs might play a decisive role in tissue remodeling of gliomas as well.

77955297293	Establishment and characterization of two cell lines derived from primary cultures of Gekko japonicus cerebral cortex	Adult Gekko japonicus is one of those vertebrates that are able to regenerate their missing or amputated tail. The most interesting feature of this animal lies in the ability of its spinal cord to regrow a functional tail. A fundamental question is whether the neuroglial cells play a different role compared with high vertebrates. Since in vitro studies using primary neuroglial cells are hampered by the limited lifespan and miscellaneous genetic background of these cells, we generated neuroglial cell lines from primary cell cultures of cerebral cortex of G. japonicus. The SV40 (simian-virus-40) T antigen gene was introduced into primary cell cultures. Cell cycle analysis, cell growth and proliferation, cell colony formation and contact inhibition, as well as karyotype assays were investigated. Two cell colonies, Gsn-1 and Gsn-3, were immunochemically characterized as glial fibrillary acidic protein and galactocerebroside-positive respectively. Compared with parental primary cells, the Gsn cells displayed shorter population doubling time, decreased percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase, higher cell proliferation index, and increased cell activity. In assays of colony characteristics, Gsn cells showed increased cell activity at the lower cell densities or FBS (fetal bovine serum) supplement. The karyotype of immortalized Gsn cells exhibited transformational characteristics with hyperdiploid and polyploid chromosomes. The cell lines will provide a useful in vitro model for gecko neuroglial cells and facilitate systematic studies investigating the biological functions of specific gene products related to regeneration of the central nervous system. © The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2010 Portland Press Ltd.

77955190521	Protective effects of nerve regeneration factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor on retinal ganglion cells in a rabbit model of acute hyper-intraocular pressure	Background: Previous studies have shown that nerve regeneration factor (NRF) provides neuroprotective effects. However, the neuroprotective effects on retinal ganglion cells in an animal model of glaucoma remain uncertain. Objective: To determine the neuroprotective effects of NRF on retinal ganglion cells in a rabbit model of acute hyper-intraocular pressure and to compare the effects on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Design, Time and Setting: A randomized, controlled, animal experiment was performed at Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Neural Regeneration from September 2006 to August 2007. Materials: Sterone, a major component of NRF, was provided by the Key Laboratory of Neural Regeneration, Nantong University in China; BDNF was provided by BioDesign Inc., USA. Methods: A total of 24 healthy rabbits were randomly assigned to NRF, BDNF, and phosphate buffered saline groups, with 8 rabbits per group. The left eyes were considered normal controls, and acute hyper-intraocular pressure was induced in the right eyes via anterior chamber perfusion. The right camera vitrea bulbi was injected with 4.5 μg NRF, 3.75 μg BDNF, or 5 μL 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffered saline, respectively. Main Outcome Measures: Retinal ganglion cells were reverse-labeled using horseradish peroxidase to quantify cell density at 2, 4, and 6 mm from the optic disc edge. Results: NRF increased the number of surviving retinal ganglion cells at the optic disc edge (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). The density of surviving retinal ganglion cells decreased with increasing distance from the optic disc. The number of retinal ganglion cells in the BDNF group was similar to the NRF group (P > 0.05). At 2, 4, and 6 mm away from the optic disc edge, there was no significant difference in retinal ganglion cell density between NRF and BDNF groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: NRF provided protection to retinal ganglion cells in a rabbit model of acute hyper-intraocular pressure, i.e., NRF enhanced the survival rate of retinal ganglion cells. The neuroprotective effect was similar to BDNF.

78049383755	Development and biocompatibility evaluation of silk fibroin-based nerve grafts for peripheral nerve regeneration	Silk fibroin (SF) have been used in the field of bone or ligament tissue engineering. We developed a novel biomimetic design of the SF-based nerve graft (SF graft) which was composed of a SF-nerve guidance conduit (NGC). The SFNGC prepared via well-established procedures exhibits an eggshell-like microstructure that is responsible for its superior mechanical and permeable properties beneficial to nerve regeneration. The inner wall displays a 100-μm-thick netted structure formed by SF fibers of 10 μm diameter, which were spread out as a stiffener. The data also indicate that the cumulative release of vitamin B12 is almost 100% after 75 min of release. MTT assay was performed to determine the in vitro cytotoxicity of the SF-NGC extract fluid on the cultured L929 cells derived from an immortalized mouse fibroblast cell line. The adult rat was subjected to implantation of the SF graft for bridging a 10-mm long sciatic nerve defect. Then the following- up experiments at initial stage (1-4 weeks) of nerve regeneration including routine blood tests and histochemical investigation were used to evaluate the in vivo biocompatibility of the SF graft with peripheral nerve. The results suggested the noncytotoxicity of the SF-NGC with grade 0 as per the U.S. Pharmacopeia guidelines. The outcome of peripheral nerve repair at six months post-implantation was evaluated by a combination of electrophysiological assessment, Fluoro Gold retrograde tracing and histological investigation. The examined functional and morphological parameters show that SF grafts could promote peripheral nerve regeneration. Collectively, these data indicate that SF graft raised a potential possibility of using these newly developed nerve grafts as a promising alternative to nerve autografts. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

78649702889	The molecular cloning of glial fibrillary acidic protein in Gekko japonicus and its expression changes after spinal cord transection	The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an astrocyte-specific member of the class III intermediate filament proteins. It is generally used as a specific marker of astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). We isolated a GFAP cDNA from the brain and spinal cord cDNA library of Gekko japonicus, and prepared polyclonal antibodies against gecko GFAP to provide useful tools for further immunochemistry studies. Both the real-time quantitative PCR and western blot results revealed that the expression of GFAP in the spinal cord after transection increased, reaching its maximum level after 3 days, and then gradually decreased over the rest of the 2 weeks of the experiment. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that the increase in GFAP-positive labeling was restricted to the white matter rather than the gray matter. In particular, a slight increase in the number of GFAP positive star-shaped astrocytes was detected in the ventral and lateral regions of the white matter. Our results indicate that reactive astrogliosis in the gecko spinal cord took place primarily in the white matter during a short time interval, suggesting that the specific astrogliosis evaluated by GFAP expression might be advantageous in spinal cord regeneration. © 2010 by the University of Wroclaw, Poland.

78649573932	Isolation and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells from fetal rat dorsal root ganglia	To find a promising alternative to neurons or schwann cells (SCs) for peripheral nerve repair applications, this study sought to isolate stem cells from fetal rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants. Molecular expression analysis confirmed neural stem cell characteristics of DRG-derived neurospheres in terms of expressing neural stem cell-specific genes and a set of well-defined genes related to stem cell niches and glial fate decision. Under the influence of neurotrophic factors, bFGF and NGF, the neurospheres gave rise to neurofilament-expressing neurons and S100-expressing Schwann cell-like cells by different pathways. This study suggests that a subpopulation of stem cells that reside in DRGs is the progenitor of neurons and glia, which could directly induce the differentiation toward neurons, or SCs. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

78650042623	Use of tissue-engineered nerve grafts consisting of a chitosan/poly(lactic- co-glycolic acid)-based scaffold included with bone marrow mesenchymal cells for bridging 50-mm dog sciatic nerve gaps	Bone marrow mesenchymal cells (MSCs) have attracted increasing research interest due to their possible use as support cells for nerve tissue-engineering approaches. We developed a novel design of tissue-engineered nerve grafts consisting of a chitosan/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based neural scaffold included with autologous MSCs. The graft was used as an alternative to nerve autografts for bridging 50-mm-long gaps in dog sciatic nerve, and the repair outcome at 6 months after nerve grafting was evaluated by a combination of electrophysiological assessment, FluoroGold retrograde tracing, and histological investigation to regenerated nerve tissue and reinnervated target muscle. The experimental results indicated that introduction of autologous MSCs to the chitosan/PLGA-based neural scaffold promoted sciatic nerve regeneration and functional recovery, demonstrating significant efficacy that was, to a certain degree, close to that by nerve autografting, a gold standard for treating large peripheral nerve gaps, and better than that by grafting with the chitosan/PLGA-based scaffold alone. © 2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

78650590580	Construction of tissue engineered nerve grafts and their application in peripheral nerve regeneration	Surgical repair of severe peripheral nerve injuries represents not only a pressing medical need, but also a great clinical challenge. Autologous nerve grafting remains a golden standard for bridging an extended gap in transected nerves. The formidable limitations related to this approach, however, have evoked the development of tissue engineered nerve grafts as a promising alternative to autologous nerve grafts. A tissue engineered nerve graft is typically constructed through a combination of a neural scaffold and a variety of cellular and molecular components. The initial and basic structure of the neural scaffold that serves to provide mechanical guidance and optimal environment for nerve regeneration was a single hollow nerve guidance conduit. Later there have been several improvements to the basic structure, especially introduction of physical fillers into the lumen of a hollow nerve guidance conduit. Up to now, a diverse array of biomaterials, either of natural or of synthetic origin, together with well-defined fabrication techniques, has been employed to prepare neural scaffolds with different structures and properties. Meanwhile different types of support cells and/or growth factors have been incorporated into the neural scaffold, producing unique biochemical effects on nerve regeneration and function restoration. This review attempts to summarize different nerve grafts used for peripheral nerve repair, to highlight various basic components of tissue engineered nerve grafts in terms of their structures, features, and nerve regeneration-promoting actions, and finally to discuss current clinical applications and future perspectives of tissue engineered nerve grafts. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

78751644304	Glioma Stem/Progenitor Cells Contribute to Neovascularization via Transdifferentiation	Objective: Previous studies suggest that tumor cells might be the progenitor for tumor vasculature. Whether vascular tube formation from transdifferentiation of human glioma stem/progenitor cells (hGSPCs) contribute to angiogenesis of gliomas remain largely uncertain. Methods: hGSPCs were isolated from thirteen surgical specimens of gliomas and cultured in medium favored for stem cell growth. In vitro transdifferentiation of hGSPCs was performed under hypoxia. Expression of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) markers CD31, CD34, kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were analyzed with real-time quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence techniques. Vasculogenic mimicry of hGSPCs was evaluated in a tumor stem cell xenograft model in vivo. Relationships between content of hGSPCs and expression levels of both VECs markers and proangiogenic factors in large number of clinical specimens were further investigated in glioma tissue microarray. Results: In vitro, hGSPCs can transdifferentiate into VECs under hypoxia, they manifested typical "flagstone" pattern when cultivated in medium containing VEGF for a few days; when cultivated on Matrigel they were capable of forming capillary-like structures. Expression of VECs markers including CD31, CD34, KDR, and vWF were significantly up-regulated after transdifferentiation. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) positively stained vessels were observed inside the xenograft tumors after intracerebral transplantation of hGSPCs in athymic nude mice, implied part of tumor cells with human origin were involved in formation of tumor vessels. In surgical specimens of human glioma, tumor vascular cells coexpressing the markers of early VECs (CD34) and markers of hGSPCs (ABCG2 and nestin) suggest that these vascular cells may stemmed from hGSPCs. Conclusions: Our observations suggest the functional role of hGSPCs as endothelial progenitors, which have properties that give rise to VECs, and have the ability to form vascular endothelial tubes. However, unspecific markers (ABCG2, nestin) that stain for both endothelial as well as glioma stem cells, were found to be expressed in tumor vasculature of human specimen, and limit further interpretation of this finding. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

79953155685	Gecko CD59 is implicated in proximodistal identity during tail regeneration	Several adult reptiles, such as Gekko japonicus, have the ability to precisely re-create a missing tail after amputation. To ascertain the associated acquisition of positional information from blastemal cells and the underlying molecular mechanism of tail regeneration, a candidate molecule CD59 was isolated from gecko. CD59 transcripts displayed a graded expression in the adult gecko spinal cord with the highest level in the anterior segment, with a stable expression along the normal tail. After tail amputation, CD59 transcripts in the spinal cord proximal to the injury sites increased markedly at 1 day and 2 weeks; whereas in the regenerating blastema, strong CD59 positive signals were detected in the blastemal cells anterior to the blastema, with a gradual decrease along the proximodistal (PD) axis. When treated with RA following amputation, CD59 transcripts in the blastema were up-regulated. PD confrontation assays revealed that the proximal blastema engulfed the distal one after in vitro culture, and rabbit-anti human CD59 antibody was able to block this PD engulfment. Overexpression of the CD59 during tail regeneration causes distal blastemal cells to translocate to a more proximal location. Our results suggest that position identity is not restricted to amphibian limb regeneration, but has already been established in tail blastema of reptiles. The CD59, a cell surface molecule, acted as a determinant of proximal-distal cell identity. © 2011 Wang et al.

79953235470	Downregulation of Pax3 expression correlates with acquired GFAP expression during NSC differentiation towards astrocytes	Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a principal intermediate filament in mature astrocytes of the central nervous system (CNS), and the regulation of GFAP transcription has not been well understood yet. In the present study, we reported paired box 3 protein (Pax3) as a novel regulator of GFAP transcription, which could bind the promoter region of GFAP and down regulate the GFAP level during the serum-induced astrocyte differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs). Moreover, the overexpression and suppression of Pax3 could inhibit and promote NSC differentiation, respectively. These data suggest that Pax3 negatively regulates GFAP expression during astrocyte differentiation in vitro. © 2011 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

79953289309	Early changes of microRNAs expression in the dorsal root ganglia following rat sciatic nerve transection	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Here we report early alterations of miRNAs expression following rat sciatic nerve injury using microarray analysis. We harvested dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tissues and identified 19 miRNAs that showed significant changes at four early time points after sciatic nerve transection. Subsequently, miR-188 and miR-500 microarray results were verified by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The bioinformatics analysis indicated that the potential targets for these miRNAs were involved in the intracellular signaling cascade, the regulation of signal transduction, the regulation of cellular process and the response to cAMP that were known to play important roles in mobilizing the inherent capacity for neurite outgrowth and promoting regeneration during the early phase of sciatic nerve injury. Our results show that abnormal expression of miRNAs may contribute to illustrate the molecular mechanisms of nerve regeneration and miRNAs are potential targets for therapeutic interventions that may enhance intrinsic regenerative ability. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

79954583408	Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase regulates the alternative splicing of tau exon 10: A mechanism involved in tau pathology of Alzheimer disease	Hyperphosphorylation and deposition of tau into neurofibrillary tangles is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Alternative splicing of tau exon 10 generates tau isoforms containing three or four microtubule binding repeats (3R-tau and 4R-tau), which are equally expressed in adult human brain. Dysregulation of exon 10 causes neurofibrillary degeneration. Here, we report that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA, phosphorylates splicing factor SRSF1, modulates its binding to tau pre-mRNA, and promotes tau exon 10 inclusion in cultured cells and in vivo in rat brain. PKA-Cα, but not PKA-Cβ, interacts with SRSF1 and elevates SRSF1-mediated tau exon 10 inclusion. In AD brain, the decreased level of PKA-Cα correlates with the increased level of 3R-tau. These findings suggest that a downregulation of PKA dysregulates the alternative splicing of tau exon 10 and contributes to neurofibrillary degeneration in AD by causing an imbalance in 3R-tau and 4R-tau expression. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

80052371675	Age-related changes in myelin morphology, electrophysiological property and myelin-associated protein expression of mouse sciatic nerves	This study investigated the morphological and functional changes in peripheral nerves during the maturation and aging process. In a mouse sciatic nerve model, electron micrographs revealed that the number of myelin sheath lamellae gradually increased from 1 week through 12 months of age, when it reached the peak value, and then remained unchanged until 18 months of age; electrophysiological examinations showed that the amplitude of compound muscle action potentials gradually increased from 1 week through 18 months of age and displayed a positive linear correlation with the number of myelin sheath lamellae. Western blot analysis exhibited the age-related expression patterns of four myelin-associated proteins, i.e., myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), myelin basic protein (MBP), glycoprotein P0 (P0) and peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). And MAG, MBP and PMP22 showed linear negative or positive correlations with the number of myelin sheath lamellae. Our results suggest that the morphological and functional changes in peripheral nerves are closely related to each other and the myelin-associated proteins perform distinct actions on the formation, maturation, degeneration and regeneration of myelin sheaths. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

80052744482	Profile of microRNAs following rat sciatic nerve injury by deep sequencing: Implication for mechanisms of nerve regeneration	Unlike the central nervous system, peripheral nerves can regenerate when damaged. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a novel class of small, non-coding RNA that regulates gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Here, we report regular alterations of miRNA expression following rat sciatic nerve injury using deep sequencing. We harvested dorsal root ganglia tissues and the proximal stumps of the nerve, and identified 201 and 225 known miRNAs with significant expression variance at five time points in these tissues after sciatic nerve transaction, respectively. Subsequently, hierarchical clustering, miRNA expression pattern and co-expression network were performed. We screened out specific miRNAs and further obtained the intersection genes through target analysis software (Targetscan and miRanda). Moreover, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of these intersection genes were performed. The bioinformatics analysis indicated that the potential targets for these miRNAs were involved in nerve regeneration, including neurogenesis, neuron differentiation, vesicle-mediated transport, homophilic cell adhesion and negative regulation of programmed cell death that were known to play important roles in regulating nerve repair. Finally, we combined differentially expressed mRNA with the predicted targets for selecting inverse miRNA-target pairs. Our results show that the abnormal expression of miRNA may contribute to illustrate the molecular mechanisms of nerve regeneration and that miRNAs are potential targets for therapeutic interventions and may enhance intrinsic regenerative ability. © 2011 Yu et al.

80052833427	Identification and functional annotation of novel microRNAs in the proximal sciatic nerve after sciatic nerve transection	The peripheral nervous system is able to regenerate after injury, and regeneration is associated with the expression of many genes and proteins. MicroRNAs are evolutionarily conserved, small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the level of translation. In this paper, we focus on the identification and functional annotation of novel microRNAs in the proximal sciatic nerve after rat sciatic nerve transection. Using Solexa sequencing, computational analysis, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR verification, we identified 98 novel microRNAs expressed on days 0, 1, 4, 7, and 14 after nerve transection. Furthermore, we predicted the target genes of these microRNAs and analyzed the biological processes in which they were involved. The identified biological processes were consistent with the known time-frame of peripheral nerve injury and repair. Our data provide an important resource for further study of the role and regulation of microRNAs in peripheral nerve injury and regeneration. © The Author(s) 2011.

80053997654	Nerve conduits based on immobilization of nerve growth factor onto modified chitosan by using genipin as a crosslinking agent	Incorporation of nerve growth factor (NGF) into a nerve conduit can improve peripheral nerve regeneration. Here, genipin, a natural and low toxic agent, was used to crosslink chitosan, a natural polysaccharide, and concurrently to immobilize NGF onto modified chitosan, followed by fabrication of chitosan (CS)-genipin (GP)-NGF nerve conduits. MTT test showed that the cell viability of Schwann cells cultured in the conduit extract was not significantly different from that in plain medium. The neurite outgrowth measurement and immunocytochemistry with anti-growth-associated protein-43 and anti-neurofilament indicated that NGF released from CS-GP-NGF nerve conduits retained the bioactivity of stimulating neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Fracture strength measurements and vitamin B12 release analysis confirmed that CS-GP-NGF nerve conduits possessed good mechanical properties and adequate permeability. We also investigated the in vitro release kinetics of NGF from CS-GP-NGF nerve conduits by ELISA. The continuous release profile of NGF, within a 60-day time span, consisted of an initial burst that was controlled by a concentration gradient-driven diffusion, followed by a zero-order release that was controlled by a degradation of chitosan matrix. Collectively, CS-GP-NGF nerve conduits had an integrated system for continuous release of NGF, thus holding promise for peripheral nerve repair applications. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

80455129272	Altered microRNA expression following sciatic nerve resection in dorsal root ganglia of rats	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs (∼22 nucleotides) that negatively regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, either through translational inhibition or degradation of target mRNAs. We uncovered a previously unknown alteration in the expression of miRNAs in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) at 1, 4, 7, and 14 days after resection of the sciatic nerve in rats using microarray analysis. Thirty-two significantly upregulated and 18 downregulated miRNAs were identified in the DRG at four time points following sciatic nerve injury. The expression of four consecutively deregulated miRNAs, analyzed by real-time Taqman polymerase chain reaction, was in agreement with the microarray data (upregulated: miR-21, miR-221; downregulated: miR-500, miR-551b). The potential targets for these miRNAs, altered after sciatic nerve resection, are involved mainly in nervous system development, multi-cellular organismal development, and the regulation of cellular processes. This study demonstrated a different involvement of miRNAs in the DRG after resection of the sciatic nerve in a rat model, and it may also contribute in illustrating the molecular mechanisms responsible for nerve regeneration. © The Author 2011.

84855195935	Bone marrow stromal cells-loaded chitosan conduits promote repair of complete transection injury in rat spinal cord	In this study, a chitosan conduit loaded with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) was developed to bridge the gap in the transected spinal cord of adult rats, and the nerve repair outcomes were evaluated by functional and histological techniques at 12 weeks after implantation. As compared to chitosan conduits alone, incorporation of BMSCs within chitosan conduits yielded additional improving effects on nerve regeneration and function restoration. The measurements with the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale or of motor evoked potentials indicated that motor functional recovery was enhanced; retrograde tracing confirmed that the ascending tract was regenerated and the neural pathway was established; and histological analyses revealed that axon growth and remyelination in the regenerated nerve was promoted. The three-dimensional reconstruction showed that the chitosan conduit loaded with BMSCs significantly reduced the spinal cord cavity volume at the injured site. Taken together, the results collectively suggest that implantation with BMSCs-loaded chitosan conduits may become a promising approach to the repair of spinal cord injury. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

84856375978	Laser doppler perfusion imaging of skin territory to reflect autonomic functional recovery following sciatic nerve autografting repair in rats	Peripheral nerve repair requires comprehensive evaluation of functional outcomes of nerve regeneration; however, autonomic nerve function is seldom evaluated probably due to lack of suitable quantitative methods. This study sought to determine whether autonomic functional recovery could be reflected by cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) within target skin territory, as monitored by laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI). Rats with sciatic nerve defect injury received autologous nerve grafting, and the plantar surface of the hind feet was subjected to LDPI analysis following nerve repair. The results indicated that at 3 and 6 months after autologous nerve grafting, the plantar surface of the hind foot exhibited the same level of CIVD as contralateral normal side, whereas rats in nerve defect group (negative control) showed significantly reduced CIVD. In addition, suitable nerve regeneration and functional recovery were achieved as assessed by pain sensation tests as well as electrophysiological and immunohistological examinations. Based on the potential influence of local autonomic nerve signals on CIVD, it was possible to evaluate functional recovery of autonomic nerves by using LDPI measurements of dermal CIVD. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84856753381	Identification and functional analysis of novel micro-rnas in rat dorsal root ganglia after sciatic nerve resection	Peripheral nerve injures are quite common in clinical practice, and many studies have tried to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. This study focuses on the identification and functional analysis of novel miRNAs in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) following sciatic nerve resection, which is a classic model for studying peripheral nerve injury and regeneration. By using Solexa sequencing, computational analysis, Q-PCR verification, and Dicer knockdown assay, 114 novel miRNAs in rats were identified, of which 51 novel miRNAs were first reported in rat DRGs, and 63 novel miRNAs were produced at days 1, 4, 7, and 14 following sciatic nerve resection. We further predicted target genes of these miRNAs and analyzed the biological processes in which they were involved. The identified biological processes were consistent with the time frame of peripheral nerve injury and regeneration, revealing that these miRNAs were genuine miRNAs related to nerve regeneration. Our data provide an important resource for the future study of function and regulation of these miRNAs and contribute to elucidation of tyhe molecular mechanisms responsible for peripheral nerve injury and regeneration. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84856248040	Surgical repair of a 30 mm long human median nerve defect in the distal forearm by implantation of a chitosan-PGA nerve guidance conduit	This paper describes a clinical case study in which a chitosan/polyglycolic acid nerve guidance conduit (chitosan-PGA NGC) was utilized to repair a 30 mm long median nerve defect in the right distal forearm of a 55 year-old male patient. Thirty-six months after the nerve repair, the palm abduction of the thumb and the thumb-index digital opposition recovered, facilitating the patient to accomplish fine activities, such as handling chopsticks. Static two-point discrimination measured 14, 9 and 9 mm in the thumb, index and middle fingers of the right hand. Reproducible compound muscle action potentials were recorded on the right abductor pollicis. The ninhydrin test, a classical method for assessing sympathetic nerve function, showed partial recovery of the perspiration function of the injured thumb, index and middle fingers. This repair case suggested a possible strategy for the clinical reconstruction of extended defects in human peripheral nerve trunks by the implantation of chitosan-PGA NGCs. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84859600326	Inhibition of gecko GSK-3β promotes elongation of neurites and oligodendrocyte processes but decreases the proliferation of blastemal cells	GSK-3β signaling is involved in regulation of both neuronal and glial cell functions, and interference of the signaling affects central nervous system (CNS) development and regeneration. Thus, GSK-3β was proposed to be an important therapeutic target for promoting functional recovery of adult CNS injuries. To further clarify the regulatory function of the kinase on the CNS regeneration, we characterized gecko GSK-3β and determined the effects of GSK-3β inactivation on the neuronal and glial cell lines, as well as on the gecko tail (including spinal cord) regeneration. Gecko GSK-3β shares 91.7-96.7% identity with those of other vertebrates, and presented higher expression abundance in brain and spinal cord. The kinase strongly colocalized with the oligodendrocytes while less colocalized with neurons in the spinal cord. Phosphorylated GSK-3β (pGSK-3β) levels decreased gradually during the normally regenerating spinal cord ranging from L13 to the 6th caudal vertebra. Lithium injection increased the pGSK-3β levels of the corresponding spinal cord segments, and in vitro experiments on neurons and oligodendrocyte cell line revealed that the elevation of pGSK-3β promoted elongation of neurites and oligodendrocyte processes. In the normally regenerate tails, pGSK-3β kept stable in 2 weeks, whereas decreased at 4 weeks. Injection of lithium led to the elevation of pGSK-3β levels time-dependently, however destructed the regeneration of the tail including spinal cord. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining demonstrated that inactivation of GSK-3β decreased the proliferation of blastemal cells. Our results suggested that species-specific regulation of GSK-3β was indispensable for the complete regeneration of CNS. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84861100305	The expression changes of Numblike in rat brain cortex after traumatic brain injury	Numblike (Numbl) plays an important role in ependymal wall integrity and subventricular zone neuroblast survival. And Numbl is specifically expressed in the brain. However, its expression and function in the central nervous system lesion are still unclear. In this study, we performed a traumatic brain injury (TBI) model in adult rats and investigated the dynamic changes of Numbl expression in the brain cortex. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that Numbl was present in normal brain. It gradually decreased, reached the lowest point at day 3 after TBI, and then increased during the following days. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that Numbl immunoreactivity was found in neurons, but not astrocytes and microglia. Moreover, the 3rd day post injury was the apoptotic peak implied by the alteration of caspase-3. All these results suggested that Numbl may be involved in the pathophysiology of TBI and further research is needed to have a good understanding of its function and mechanism.. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

The objective of this study was to gain new insight into the whole protein composition of SCs.Results: Two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) was performed to identify the protein expressions in primary cultured SCs of rats. We identified a total of 1,232 proteins, which were categorized into 20 functional classes. We also used quantitative real time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis to validate some of proteomics-identified proteins.Conclusion: We showed for the first time the proteome map of SCs. Our data could serve as a reference library to provide basic information for understanding SC biology. © 2012 Shen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84862829650	Bridging peripheral nerve defects with a tissue engineered nerve graft composed of an in vitro cultured nerve equivalent and a silk fibroin-based scaffold	Tissue engineered nerve grafts are considered as a promising alternative to autologous nerve grafts used for peripheral nerve repair. The differences between these two types of nerve grafts are mainly in the regenerative microenvironment established by them. To construct ideal tissue engineered nerve grafts, it is therefore required to develop a better way to introduce biochemical cues into a neural scaffold, as compared to single or combined use of support cells and growth factors. Here, we used a co-culture system of dorsal root ganglia and Schwann cells to create an in vitro formed nerve equivalent, which was introduced into a silk fibroin-based scaffold to furnish a tissue engineered nerve graft (TENG). At 4- and 12- weeks after the TENG was implanted to bridge a 10-mm-long sciatic nerve defect in rats, histological and functional assessments as well as Western blot analysis were performed to evaluate the influences of the TENG on peripheral nerve regeneration. We found that at an early stage of nerve regeneration, the TENG significantly accelerated axonal growth, and up-regulated expressions of N-cadherin and PMP22. Twelve weeks after nerve grafting, the TENG produced a further improved outcome of nerve regeneration and functional recovery, which was more close to that of the autologous nerve graft than that of the silk fibroin-based scaffold. The introduction of an in vitro cultured nerve equivalent into a scaffold might contribute to establishing a native-like microenvironment for nerve regeneration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Tissue-engineered nerve grafts (TENGs) constitute a promising alternative to nerve autografts that are recognized as the gold standard for surgical repair of peripheral nerve gaps. Objective. To investigate the feasibility of using TENGs for bridging extra large peripheral nerve gaps in large animals. Methods. TENGs were constructed by incorporating autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into a neural scaffold that consisted of a chitosan conduit inserted with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) fibers. A 60-mm-long sciatic nerve gap in dogs was bridged by TENGs, chitosan/PLGA scaffolds, or nerve autografts. At 12 months postsurgery, behavioral analysis, electrophysiology, retrograde fluorogold tracing, and histological examination were performed. Results. The outcomes of TENGs were similar to those of autografts and better than those of scaffolds alone. Conclusion. Introduction of autologous MSCs to a chitosan/PLGA scaffold improved the repair and rehabilitation of a large gap after peripheral nerve injury in dogs. Autologous MSCs may be a source of support cells for neural tissue engineering. © American Society of Neurorehabilitation 2012.

84863983350	ITRAQ-coupled 2D LC-MS/MS analysis on differentially expressed proteins in denervated tibialis anterior muscle of rattus norvegicus	To understand the molecular aspects of denervationinduced atrophy of skeletal muscles, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were performed to detect a total of 260 proteins that were differentially expressed in the rat tibialis anterior muscle at different times (1, 4, and 8 weeks) after rat sciatic nerve transection. Western blot, gene ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were further conducted for protein validation, functional annotation, and pathway identification, respectively. Among 260 dysregulated proteins, metabolic enzymes represented the largest class of proteins differentially expressed; a down-regulation of β-enolase might be associated with a decreased expression of fast-twitch myosin-4; the 14-3-3 proteins displayed an up-regulation, which might facilitate the inhibition of mTOR signaling; an upregulation of a-crystallin B chain might be related to the later onset and the slower progress of atrophy; an up-regulation of phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein-1 perhaps progressively abrogated the cell survival and antiapoptotic properties during muscle atrophy. These results might contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating denervation-induced muscle atrophy. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2011.

84864000744	The influence of substrate stiffness on the behavior and functions of Schwann cells in culture	Solid tissues in the body possess a range of stiffness and provide cells with an instructive microenvironment. Scaffolds in tissue engineering should be rationally designed to become an adhesion substrate friendly to cells. Schwann cells are the principal glial cell in the peripheral nervous system and used as support cells for generating tissue-engineered nerve grafts. Although an important mechanical cue, substrate stiffness, has been documented to make significant effects on many types of cells cultured on the substrate, such a study for Schwann cells is still lacking. In this study, we investigated cell adhesion, survival, proliferation, migration, cytoskeleton, and neurotrophic actions of Schwann cells cultured on polyacrylamide gel substrates with different stiffness, and determined an optimal elastic modulus value for these substrates. Our data not only highlight the importance of substrate stiffness in the crosstalk between Schwann cells and surrounding microenvironment, but also introduce a new parameter, in addition to biocompatibility, biodegradability, and neuroaffinity, for designing scaffolds in nerve tissue engineering. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84864999008	Mir-221 and mir-222 promote Schwann cell proliferation and migration by targeting LASS2 after sciatic nerve injury	microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Their roles in regulating the responses of Schwann cells (SCs) to injury stimuli remain unexplored. Here we report dynamic alteration of miRNA expression following rat sciatic nerve injury using microarray analysis. We harvested the proximal nerve stumps and identified 77 miRNAs that showed significant changes at four time points after nerve transection. Subsequently, we analyzed the expression pattern of miRNA, selected one significant profile, and then integrated putative miRNA targets with differentially expressed mRNA yielding 274 potential targets. The 274 targets were mainly involved in cell proliferation, cell locomotion and cellular homeostasis that were known to play important roles in modulating cell phenotype. The upregulation of the miR-221 and miR-222 cluster (miR-221/222) was found to correlate with the injury-induced SC phenotypic modulation. Enhanced expression of miR-221/222 could promote SC proliferation and migration in vitro, whereas silencing their expression resulted in a reduced proliferation and migration. Further studies revealed that longevity assurance homologue 2 (LASS2) was a direct target of miR-221/222 in SCs because miR-221/222 bound directly to the 39-untranslated region of LASS2, thus reducing both mRNA and protein levels of LASS2. Silencing of LASS2 recapitulated the effects of miR-221/222 mimics, whereas enforced knockdown of LASS2 reversed the suppressive effects of miR-221/222 inhibitors. Our findings indicate that injury promotes SC proliferation and migration through the regulation of miR-221/222 by targeting LASS2, and provide new insights into the role of miRNAs in nerve regeneration.

84865054420	Chronic biocompatibility of chitosan/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) tissue engineered nerve transplanted into Beagles	BACKGROUND: Short-term biocompatibility test within 2 months has showed that chitosan, polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid have no toxicity in rat peripheral nerve, which can be used as tissue engineered nerve materials. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the chronic biocompatibility of the chitosan/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) tissue engineered nerve transplanted into beagles. METHODS: The tissue engineered nerve was prepared through inserting the PLGA filaments into chitosan conduits, and then transplanted into beagles bridging sciatic nerve 50 mm defect, and autologous nerve graft was taken as control at the same time. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The status, appetite and activity of beagles which were transplanted with chitosan/PLGA tissue engineered nerve were good and the weight gain were similar to the autologous nerve graft group. Hematology and serum biochemical tests results after 2, 4, 6 months were also similar to the control group and there were no significant difference between two groups. Necrosis and degeneration was not found in the regenerated nerve as well as the surrounding tissues. And the tissue biopsies of the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and other major organs were not abnormal. The chronic biocompatibility of the chitosan/PLGA tissue engineered nerve which was transplanted into Beagles for 6 months was good.

84864245951	The cloning of growth associated protein 43 of Gekko japonicus and its effect on cell morphology	The growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) gene of Gekko japonicus was obtained from a brain and spinal cord cDNA library. The results of northern blot analysis showed the gecko GAP-43 gene transcript is 1.7 kb in length, and it was abundantly expressed in tissues of brain, spinal cord and ovary. Gecko GAP-43 promoted the outgrowth of Gsn3 cells and PC12 cell in vitro, and phosphorylation at serine 42 modulated the effect of GAP-43 on cell spreading and morphology. The change in GAP-43 expression in the spinal cord after tail amputation was examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The level of GAP-43 in the spinal cord was increased during the time course we examined, indicating a possible correlation between GAP-43 expression and the spinal cord injury and regeneration. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84864387587	Gene expression profiling of the rat sciatic nerve in early Wallerian degeneration after injury	Wallerian degeneration is an important area of research in modern neuroscience. A large number of genes are differentially regulated in the various stages of Wallerian degeneration, especially during the early response. In this study, we analyzed gene expression in early Wallerian degeneration of the distal nerve stump at 0, 0.5, 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours after rat sciatic nerve injury using gene chip microarrays. We screened for differentially-expressed genes and gene expression patterns. We examined the data for Gene Ontology, and explored the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway. This allowed us to identify key regulatory factors and recurrent network motifs. We identified 1 546 differentially-expressed genes and 21 distinct patterns of gene expression in early Wallerian degeneration, and an enrichment of genes associated with the immune response, acute inflammation, apoptosis, cell adhesion, ion transport and the extracellular matrix. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed components involved in the Jak-STAT, ErbB, transforming growth factor-β, T cell receptor and calcium signaling pathways. Key factors included interleukin-6, interleukin-1, integrin, c-sarcoma, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand, matrix metalloproteinase, BH3 interacting domain death agonist, baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 3 and Rac. The data were validated with real-time quantitative PCR. This study provides a global view of gene expression profiles in early Wallerian degeneration of the rat sciatic nerve. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying early Wallerian degeneration, and the regulation of nerve degeneration and regeneration.

0037434909	Developmental regulation of β-1,3-galactosyltransferase-1 gene expression in mouse brain	β-1,3-galactosyltransferase-1 (β3GalT-1) is the key enzyme to form the type 1 chain structure. Northern blot analysis indicated that β3GalT-1 was expressed predominantly in the brain. In the present study, it was revealed that the gene expression of β3GalT-1 in mouse brain was developmentally decreased. High expression levels of β3GalT-1 were found in cerebral cortex and hippocampus in both newborn and adult mice, while in cerebellum, the expression levels decreased markedly during development. In situ hybridization revealed that the absence of expression in cerebellar granual cell layers contributed to the main loss of β3GalT-1 expression in adult mouse cerebellum. Moreover, the decreased levels of β3GalT-1could affect the synthesis of type 1 chain oligosaccharides, as revealed by immunohistochemistry analysis. © 2003 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

0038031660	Overexpression of β-1,4-galactosyltransferase I in rat Schwann cells promotes the growth of co-cultured dorsal root ganglia	The cell surface β-1,4-galactosyltransferase I (β-1,4-GalT-I) functions as one of the receptors of laminin during the neurite outgrowth on basal lamina by binding to N-linked oligosaccharides in the laminin E8 domain. In this study, we demonstrated that the purified rat Schwann cells transfected with the expression plasmid of β-1,4-GalT-I cDNA transiently promoted outgrowth and elongation of the neurites from co-cultured rat dorsal root ganglia, while those transfected with the antisense expression plasmid of β-1,4-GalT-I had the opposite effects. These results suggested that the expression of β-1,4-GalT-I in Schwann cells of peripheral nerve might promote both growth of developmental neuron and regeneration of injured nerve. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

84866371537	microRNA-222 Targeting PTEN Promotes Neurite Outgrowth from Adult Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons following Sciatic Nerve Transection	Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons spontaneously undergo neurite growth after nerve injury. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as small, non-coding RNAs, negatively regulate gene expression in a variety of biological processes. The roles of miRNAs in the regulation of responses of DRG neurons to injury stimuli, however, are not fully understood. Here, microarray analysis was performed to profile the miRNAs in L4-L6 DRGs following rat sciatic nerve transection. The 26 known miRNAs were differentially expressed at 0, 1, 4, 7, 14 d post injury, and the potential targets of the miRNAs were involved in nerve regeneration, as analyzed by bioinformatics. Among the 26 miRNAs, microRNA-222 (miR-222) was our research focus because its increased expression promoted neurite outgrowth while it silencing by miR-222 inhibitor reduced neurite outgrowth. Knockdown experiments confirmed that phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a major inhibitor of nerve regeneration, was a direct target of miR-222 in DRG neurons. In addition, we found that miR-222 might regulate the phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) through PTEN, and c-Jun activation might enhance the miR-222 expression. Collectively, our data suggest that miR-222 could regulate neurite outgrowth from DRG neurons by targeting PTEN. © 2012 Zhou et al.

84866464936	Gene Network Revealed Involvements of Birc2, Birc3 and Tnfrsf1a in Anti-Apoptosis of Injured Peripheral Nerves	Crush injury or axotomy of peripheral nerves results in the rapid production of the inflammatory cytokines, which were confirmed in various models, to some extent, to be noxious to the myelin sheath or Schwann cells (SCs). TNF-α is one of the primary initiators of the inflammatory cascade and exerts pleiotropic functions in the physiological conditions by binding to its receptors, type I (TNFRI) and type II (TNFRII). The pathway molecules TNFRI, Birc2 and Birc3 play key roles during the activation of the signaling. Injured peripheral nerves, preventing them from TNF-α-mediated destruction and proceeding to successful regeneration, might initiate an anti-apoptotic mechanism. To identity the exact functions of TNFRI, Birc2 and Birc3, as well as its involved pathways in the cellular events, we inferred a dynamic gene regulatory network from short time-series measurements of the proximal nerve segment cDNA microarray following rat sciatic nerve transection. TNFRI family member Tnfrsf1a, Birc2 and Birc3 were mined out integrating as master regulators to mediate inflammatory responses. Experiments revealed that Tnfrsf1a, Birc2 and Birc3 proteins colocalized with S100 in the rat peripheral nerve tissues, and the expression levels increased with the time extension. Knockdown of the proteins induced the apoptotic formation of primary cultured SCs by upregulation of caspase 3 and caspase 6. Our systematic analysis indicated that Tnfrsf1a, Birc2 and Birc3 of SCs, not originally regarded as XIAP, were mainly responsible for the inflammation-mediated anti-apoptosis of peripheral nerves. Birc2 and Birc3 might be the most potential targets for anti-apoptotic protection mediated by inflammatory cytokines. © 2012 Wang et al.

84867589588	Involvement of gecko SNAP25b in spinal cord regeneration by promoting outgrowth and elongation of neurites	SNARE complex mediates cellular membrane fusion events essential for neurotransmitter release and synaptogenesis. SNAP25, a member of the SNARE proteins, plays critical roles during the development of the central nervous system via regulation by alternative splicing and protein kinase phosphorylation. To date, little information is available regarding the protein in the spinal cord regeneration, especially for the postnatal highly expressed isoform SNAP25b. In the present study, we characterized gecko SNAP25b, which shared high identity with those of other vertebrates. Expression of gecko SNAP25b was temporally upregulated in both neurons of spinal cord and forming ependymal tube following tail amputation, coinciding with the occurrence of regenerate re-innervation. Overexpression of gecko wild type SNAP25b in the SH-SY5Y and undifferentiated PC12 cells promoted the elongation and outgrowth of neurites, while mutant constructs at Serine

84868117089	Long-term outcome of the repair of 50 mm long median nerve defects in rhesus monkeys with marrow mesenchymal stem cells-containing, chitosan-based tissue engineered nerve grafts	Despite great progress in the fields of tissue engineering and stem cell therapy, the translational and preclinical studies are required to accelerate the clinical application of tissue engineered nerve grafts, as an alternative to autologous nerve grafts, for peripheral nerve repair. Rhesus monkeys (non-human primates) are more clinically relevant and more suitable for scaling up to humans as compared to other mammalians. Based on this premise, and considering a striking similarity in the anatomy and function between human and monkey hands, here we used chitosan/PLGA-based, autologous marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-containing tissue engineered nerve grafts (TENGs) for bridging a 50-mm long median nerve defect in rhesus monkeys. At 12 months after grafting, locomotive activity observation, electrophysiological assessments, and FG retrograde tracing tests indicated that the recovery of nerve function by TENGs was more efficient than that by chitosan/PLGA scaffolds alone; histological and morphometric analyses of regenerated nerves further confirmed that the morphological reconstruction by TENGs was close to that by autografts and superior to that by chitosan/PLGA scaffolds alone. In addition, blood test and histopathological examination demonstrated that TENGs featured by addition of autologous MSCs could be safely used in the primate body. These findings suggest the efficacy of our developed TENGs for peripheral nerve regeneration and their promising perspective for clinical applications. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84869054400	MiR-182 inhibits Schwann cell proliferation and migration by targeting FGF9 and NTM, respectively at an early stage following sciatic nerve injury	The regulation of Schwann cell (SC) responses to injury stimuli by microRNAs (miRNAs) remains to be explored. Here, we identified 17 miRNAs that showed dynamic expression alterations at five early time points following rat sciatic nerve resection. Then we analyzed the expression pattern of 17 miRNAs, and integrated their putative targets with differentially expressed mRNAs. The resulting 222 potential targets were mainly involved in cell phenotype modulation, including immune response, cell death and cell locomotion. Among 17 miRNAs, miR-182 expression was up-regulated. The enhanced expression of miR-182 was correlated with nerve injury-induced phenotype modulation of SCs. Further investigation revealed that fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) and neurotrimin (NTM) were two direct targets of miR-182 in SCs, with miR-182 binding to the 3′-untranslated region of FGF9 and NTM. Silencing of FGF9 and NTM recapitulated the inhibiting effect of miR-182 mimics on SC proliferation and migration, respectively, whereas enforced knockdown of FGF9 and NTM reversed the promoting effect of miR-182 inhibitor on SC proliferation and migration, respectively. Our data indicate that nerve injury inhibits SC proliferation and migration through rapid regulation of miR-182 by targeting FGF9 and NTM, providing novel insights into the roles of miRNAs in nerve injury and repair. © 2012 The Author(s).

84873711613	Signal flow and pathways in response to early Wallerian degeneration after rat sciatic nerve injury	Wallerian degeneration (WD) remains a subject of critical research interest in modern neurobiology. WD is a process which a large number of genes are differentially regulated, especially the early response to activate nerve degeneration and regeneration, but the precise mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we report the signal pathways, key regulate recurrent neural networks and signal flow in the early WD. The data indicated that there are several kinds of up- or down-regulated genes, relating to the regulation of response to stimulus, signal transmission via phosphorylation event, immune response, apoptosis and regulation of cell communication. KEGG pathway analysis revealed activity mainly relating to cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, MAPK signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway and TGF-beta signaling pathway involved in the recurrent neural networks that were regulated by the key factors, Cldn-14, Cldn-15, ITG, BID and BIRC3. These results will help to much better understand information relating to the early response to WD and provide us with a firmer basis in future investigations on the molecular mechanisms of WD that regulate nerve degeneration and/or regeneration. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84873055365	Altered long noncoding RNA expressions in dorsal root ganglion after rat sciatic nerve injury	Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons spontaneously undergo robust neurite growth after axotomy. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of pervasive genes involved in a variety of biological functions. However, the functions of lncRNAs in the regulation of responses of DRG neurons to injury stimuli remain untested. Here, lncRNA microarray analysis was performed to profile the lncRNAs in L4-L6 DRGs following rat sciatic nerve resection. The 105 lncRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed at 0, 1, 4, 7 d post injury. A coexpression network of 24 down-regulated lncRNAs and coding genes was constructed, and 115 targets of these 24 lncRNAs were found to be mainly involved in cell phenotype modulation, including glial cell migration, purinergic nucleotide receptor signaling pathway, vasodilation, regulation of multi-organism process, and neuropeptide signaling pathway, and also to be potentially associated with several key regeneration signaling pathways, including MAPK signaling pathway, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. LncRNA BC089918 was selected from 24 down-regulated lncRNAs for validation by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. And silencing of BC089918 with small interfering RNAs indicted that the lncRNA had a particular promoting effect on neurite outgrowth. Our data demonstrated a distinct involvement of lncRNAs in DRGs after nerve injury, thus contributing to illustration of molecular mechanisms responsible for nerve regeneration. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84874339712	Differential Gene Expression Profiling and Biological Process Analysis in Proximal Nerve Segments after Sciatic Nerve Transection	After traumatic injury, peripheral nerves can spontaneously regenerate through highly sophisticated and dynamic processes that are regulated by multiple cellular elements and molecular factors. Despite evidence of morphological changes and of expression changes of a few regulatory genes, global knowledge of gene expression changes and related biological processes during peripheral nerve injury and regeneration is still lacking. Here we aimed to profile global mRNA expression changes in proximal nerve segments of adult rats after sciatic nerve transection. According to DNA microarray analysis, the huge number of genes was differentially expressed at different time points (0.5 h-14 d) post nerve transection, exhibiting multiple distinct temporal expression patterns. The expression changes of several genes were further validated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis. The gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed to decipher the biological processes involving the differentially expressed genes. Collectively, our results highlighted the dynamic change of the important biological processes and the time-dependent expression of key regulatory genes after peripheral nerve injury. Interestingly, we, for the first time, reported the presence of olfactory receptors in sciatic nerves. Hopefully, this study may provide a useful platform for deeply studying peripheral nerve injury and regeneration from a molecular-level perspective. © 2013 Li et al.

84878586251	Expression changes and bioinformatic analysis of Wallerian degeneration after sciatic nerve injury in rat	Wallerian degeneration (WD) remains an important research topic. Many genes are differentially expressed during the process of WD, but the precise mechanisms responsible for these differentiations are not completely understood. In this study, we used microarrays to analyze the expression changes of the distal nerve stump at 0, 1, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after sciatic nerve injury in rats. The data revealed 6 076 differentially-expressed genes, with 23 types of expression, specifically enriched in genes associated with nerve development and axonogenesis, cytokine biosynthesis, cell differentiation, cytokine/chemokine production, neuron differentiation, cytokinesis, phosphorylation and axon regeneration. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis gave findings related mainly to the MAPK signaling pathway, the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, the cell cycle, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the p53 signaling pathway and the Wnt signaling pathway. Some key factors were NGF, MAG, CNTF, CTNNA2, p53, JAK2, PLCB1, STAT3, BDNF, PRKC, collagen II, FGF, THBS4, TNC and c-Src, which were further validated by real-time quantitative PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the functional analysis of differentially-expressed genes in WD and may shed light on the molecular mechanisms of nerve degeneration and regeneration. © 2013 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84886788421	Signaling pathways regulating dose-dependent dual effects of TNF-α on primary cultured Schwann cells	After peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells are rapidly activated to participate in the regenerative process and modulate local immune reactions. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), one of the major initiators of the inflammatory cascade, has been known to exert pleiotropic functions during peripheral nerve injury and regeneration. In this study, we aimed to investigate the in vitro effects of TNF-α on peripheral neural cells. First, gene-microarray analysis was applied to the RNA samples extracted from injured peripheral nerves, providing the information of gene interactions post nerve injury. Then, after primary cultured Schwann cells were treated with increasing dosages (0-40 ng/ml) of TNF-α, cell proliferation and migration were examined by EdU incorporation and a transwell-based assay, and cell apoptosis was observed and quantified by electron microscopy and Annexin V-FITC assay, respectively. The results showed that lower dosages of TNF-α increased cell proliferation and migration, whereas higher dosages of TNF-α decreased cell proliferation and migration and enhanced cell apoptosis. The tests using a chemical inhibitor of TNF-α further confirmed the above effects of TNF-α. To understand how TNF-α produced the dosedependent dual effects on primary cultured Schwann cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis, and immunocytochemistry to decipher the complex network of biochemical pathways involving many signaling molecules, i.e., TNF receptor-associated death domain, Fas-associated death domain, receptor interacting protein, JNK, NF-κB p65, and caspases, thus assuming the mechanisms by which TNF-α activated the death and survival pathways and achieved a balance between the two opposite actions in primary cultured Schwann cells.

0242552852	Increased Gene Expression of β-1,4-Galactosyltransferase I in Rat Injured Sciatic Nerve	During neurite outgrowth on basal lamina, cell-surface β-1,4- galactosyltransferase I (β-1,4-GalT-I) functions as one of the receptors of laminin by binding to N-linked oligosaccharides on the laminin E8 domain. In the present study, it was revealed that in rat injured sciatic nerves, the expression of β-1,4-GalT-I mRNA reached its peak 2-3 d after axotomy in both proximal and distal stumps, and decreased thereafter as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis. In situ hybridization revealed that β-1,4-GalT-I mRNA mainly localized in Schwann cells of the injured nerves. Moreover the Galβ1-4GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine) group mainly localized in Schwann cells of the injured nerves by Ricinus communis agglutinin-I (RCA-I) lectin histochemistry. However, the changes in abundance of the Galβ1-4GlcNAc group in injured nerves were not consistent with the expression of β-1, 4-GalT-I mRNA. These findings indicate that β-1,4-GalT-I might be involved in the regeneration of injured peripheral nerves at the early injury stage.

0242580051	The β-(1→6)-branched β-(1→3) glucohexaose and its analogues containing an α-(1→3)-linked bond have similar stimulatory effects on the mouse spleen as Lentinan	The stimulatory effects of the synthetic β-(1→6)-branched β-(1→3) glucohexaose and its analogues containing an α-(1→3)-linked bond on the mouse spleen were studied for elucidation of the mechanism of their antitumor activity, and their stimulatory effects were compared with Lentinan. The mouse spleen's weight was increased after the intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the oligosaccharides compared with the saline group. In addition, routinely hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained spleen sections showed that the injection also changed the spleen's histopathology. RNA samples were isolated from splenocytes of oligosaccharides, Lentinan or saline-injected mice. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blot showed that the administration of the oligosaccharides or Lentinan enhanced mouse spleen mRNA production of TNF-α but not IL-2. The injection also enhanced Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced mouse splenocytes proliferation, but the in vitro administration of the oligosaccharides did not have the proliferation-enhancing effect. Taken together, these results suggest that the synthetic β-(1→6)-branched β-(1→3) glucohexaose and its analogues containing an α-(1→3)-linked bond have similar stimulatory effects as Lentinan. Additionally, they may exert their antitumor effects through the induction of splenocytes mediated immune responses. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84889786551	Neurological function following intra-neural injection of fluorescent neuronal tracers in rats	Fluorescent neuronal tracers should not be toxic to the nervous system when used in long-term labeling. Previous studies have addressed tracer toxicity, but whether tracers injected into an intact nerve result in functional impairment remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we examined the functions of motor, sensory and autonomic nerves following the application of 5% Fluoro-Gold, 4% True Blue and 10% Fluoro-Ruby (5 μL) to rat tibial nerves via pressure injection. A set of evaluation methods including walking track analysis, plantar test and laser Doppler perfusion imaging was used to determine the action of the fluorescent neuronal tracers. Additionally, nerve pathology and ratio of muscle wet weight were also observed. Results showed that injection of Fluoro-Gold significantly resulted in loss of motor nerve function, lower plantar sensibility, increasing blood flow volume and higher neurogenic vasodilatation. Myelinated nerve fiber degeneration, unclear boundaries in nerve fibers and high retrograde labeling efficacy were observed in the Fluoro-Gold group. The True Blue group also showed obvious neurogenic vasodilatation, but less severe loss of motor function and degeneration, and fewer labeled motor neurons were found compared with the Fluoro-Gold group. No anomalies of motor and sensory nerve function and no myelinated nerve fiber degeneration were observed in the Fluoro-Ruby group. Experimental findings indicate that Fluoro-Gold tracing could lead to significant functional impairment of motor, sensory and autonomic nerves, while functional impairment was less severe following True Blue tracing. Fluoro-Ruby injection appears to have no effect on neurological function.

84890847276	Basic fibroblast growth factor is a key factor that induces bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells towards cells with Schwann cell phenotype	Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be differentiate towards a Schwann cells (SCs) lineage when exposed to pre-inducing reagents β-mercaptoethanol (BME) and retinoic acid (RA), followed by inducing factors: forskolin (FSK), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and heregulin (HRG). However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated the individual effects of these inducing factors on the differentiation of MSCs towards SC phenotype in rats. We show that the omission of either HRG or PDGF from the induction medium is not sufficient to change the SC-like phenotype or the expression level of the SC marker, S100β. However, the omission of bFGF from the induction medium effectively blocked neural induction of the MSCs. Moreover, only bFGF was found to inhibit MSC proliferation during differentiation. To clarify the mechanism responsible for the effect of bFGF, we also investigated the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in the induced cells. Our results suggest that morphological changes in MSCs induced by bFGF depend on the activation of ERK, and bFGF may be an indispensable factor that induces MSCs to differentiate into cells with SCs phenotype. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84891373582	Chitosan/silk fibroin-based, Schwann cell-derived extracellular matrix-modified scaffolds for bridging rat sciatic nerve gaps	Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a prominent role in establishing and maintaining an ideal microenvironment for tissue regeneration, and ECM scaffolds are used as a feasible alternative to cellular and molecular therapy in the fields of tissue engineering. Because of their advantages over tissue-derived ECM scaffolds, cultured cell-derived ECM scaffolds are beginning to attract attention, but they have been scarcely studied for peripheral nerve repair. Here we aimed to develop a tissue engineered nerve scaffold by reconstituting nerve cell-derived ECM with natural biomaterials. A protocol was adopted to prepare and characterize the cultured Schwann cell (SC)-derived ECM. A chitosan conduit and silk fibroin (SF) fibers were prepared, cultured with SCs for ECM deposition, and subjected to decellularization, followed by assembly into a chitosan/SF-based, SC-derived ECM-modified scaffold, which was used to bridge a 10mm rat sciatic nerve gap. The results from morphological analysis as well as electrophysiological examination indicated that regenerative outcomes achieved by our developed scaffold were similar to those by an acellular nerve graft (namely a nerve tissue-derived ECM scaffold), but superior to those by a plain chitosan/SF scaffold. Moreover, blood and histopathological parameters confirmed the safety of scaffold modification by SC-derived ECM. Therefore, a hybrid scaffold based on joint use of acellular and classical biomaterials represents a promising approach to nerve tissue engineering. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84892863885	Neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions of Achyranthes bidentata polypeptides on cultured dorsal root ganglia of rats and on crushed common peroneal nerve of rabbits	We have isolated Achyranthes bidentata Blume polypeptides (ABPP) from the aqueous extract of A. bidentata Blume, a traditional Chinese medicine with multiple therapeutic applications. In this study, we aimed to investigate neurotrophic effects of ABPP on cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) of rats and neuroprotective effects on crushed common peroneal nerve of rabbits. Immunochemistry and Western blot analysis indicated that ABPP (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0. μg/ml) encouraged neurite outgrowth from cultured DRG explants/neurons in a concentration-dependent manner through activation of ERK1/2. After crush injury to rabbit common peroneal nerve, animals received daily administration of ABPP for 5 weeks. Electrophysiological assessments and histomorphological evaluation showed that 6.0. mg/kg ABPP significantly enhanced nerve regeneration and function restoration. Our findings suggest that ABPP could be used as a neurotrophic and neuroprotective agent to treat peripheral nerve crush injury. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84893715888	Nanoparticle mediated controlled delivery of dual growth factors	Peripheral nerve functional recovery after nerve injury generally requires multiple growth factors by synergistic effect. However, the optical combination of multiple synergistic growth factors for axonal regeneration has been scarcely considered up to now. Meanwhile, the use of growth factors in promoting nerve regeneration was limited by its short biological half-life in vivo, its vulnerability to structure disruption or hydrolyzation, leading to loss of bioactivity. Herein, a novel polymeric nanoparticle delivery system composed of heparin and e{open}-poly-L-lysine (PL) was prepared for control release of nerve growth factor (NGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The nanoparticles were synthesized by polyelectrolyte complexation in aqueous solution at room temperature, followed by cross-linking with biological genipin. The obtained nanoparticles had a spherical shape, with a mean diameter of about 246 nm, and high growth factors encapsulation efficiency as well as good stability. NGF and bFGF were encapsulated in the nanoparticles and showed a continuous and slow release behavior in vitro. The bioactivities of the released growth factors were evaluated, and exhibited the synergistic effect. The controlled release of the dual synergistic growth factors would improve the treatment of peripheral nerve injury to mimic the natural cellular microenvironments. © 2014 The Author(s).

84894384578	Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase enhances SC35-promoted Tau Exon 10 inclusion	Alternative splicing of tau exon 10 generates tau with three or four microtubule-binding repeats (3R-tau or 4R-tau). The ratio of 3R-tau to 4R-tau is approximately 1:1 in the adult normal human brain. Disturbances in the ratio result in neurodegenerative tauopathies. Splicing factor SC35 acts on a SC35-like element located at the 5′ end of tau exon 10 and promotes tau exon 10 inclusion. Here, we report that protein kinase (PKA) was able to interact and phosphorylate SC35. Activation or overexpression of PKA catalytic subunits promoted SC35-mediated tau exon 10 inclusion. Four PKA catalytic subunits, α1, α2, β1, and β2, all enhanced SC35-promoted tau exon 10 inclusion. SC35 has four putative PKA phosphorylation sites, Ser121, Ser128, Ser130, and Ser171.

84896807663	MiR-9 inhibits schwann cell migration by targeting cthrc1 following sciatic nerve injury	The regulative effects of microRNAs (miRNAs) on responses of Schwann cells to a nerve injury stimulus are not yet clear. In this study, we noted that the expression of eight miRNAs was downregulated at different time points following rat sciatic nerve transection, and found that 368 potential targets of these eight miRNAs were mainly involved in phenotypic modulation of Schwann cells. Of these miRNAs, miR-9 was identified as an important functional regulator of Schwann cell migration that was a crucial regenerative response of Schwann cells to nerve injury. In vitro, upregulated expression of miR-9 inhibited Schwann cell migration, whereas silencing of miR-9 promoted Schwann cell migration. Intriguingly, miR-9 exerted this regulative function by directly targeting collagen triple helix repeat containing protein 1 (CTHRC1), which in turn inactivated downstream Rac1 GTPase. Rac1 inhibitor reduced the promotive effects of anti-miR-9 on Schwann cell migration. In vivo, high expression of miR-9 reduced Schwann cell migration within a regenerative nerve microenvironment. Collectively, our results confirmed the role of miR-9 in regulating Schwann cell migration after nerve injury, thus offering a new approach to peripheral nerve repair. © 2014.

84899050718	Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) facilitates differentiation of adult dorsal root ganglia-derived neural stem cells toward Schwann cells by binding to FGFR-1 through MAPK/ERK activation	Considerable research has been devoted to unraveling the regulation of neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation. The responses of NSCs to various differentiation-inducing stimuli, however, are still difficult to estimate. In this study, we aimed to search for a potent growth factor that was able to effectively induce differentiation of NSCs toward Schwann cells. NSCs were isolated from dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) of adult rats and identified by immunostaining. Three different growth factors were used to stimulate the differentiation of DRG-derived NSCs (DRG-NSCs). We found that among these three growth factors, bFGF was the strongest inducer for the glial differentiation of DRG-NSCs, and bFGF induced the generation of an increased number of Schwann cell-like cells as compared to nerve growth factor (NGF) and neuregulin1-β (NRG). These Schwann cell-like cells demonstrated the same characteristics as those of primary Schwann cells. Furthermore, we noted that bFGF-induced differentiation of DRG-NSCs toward Schwann cells might be mediated by binding to fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) through activation of MAPK/ERK signal pathway. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.

84899529914	Proteomic and bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed proteins in denervated skeletal muscle	The aim of this study was to improve our understanding and the current treatment of denervation-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. We used isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) to identify the differentially expressed proteins in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of rats at 1 and 4 weeks following sciatic nerve transection. A total of 110 proteins was differentially expressed and was further classified using terms from the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases to unravel their molecular functions. Among the differentially expressed metabolic enzymes involved in glycolysis, Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, α- and β-enolase displayed an increased and decreased expression, respectively, which was further validated by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. These findings suggest that the enolase isozymic switch during denervation-induced muscle atrophy is the reverse of that occurring during muscle maturation. Notably, protein-protein interaction analysis using the STRING database indicated that the protein expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6), muscle ring-finger protein 1 (MuRF1) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFBx) was also upregulated during denervation-induced skeletal muscle atrophy, which was confirmed by western blot analysis. TRAF6 knockdown experiments in L6 myotubes suggested that the decreased expression of TRAF6 attenuated glucocorticoid-induced myotube atrophy. Therefore, we hypothesized that the upregulation of TRAF6 may be involved in the development of denervation-induced muscle atrophy, at least in part, by regulating the expression of MAFBx and MuRF1 proteins. The data from the present study provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating denervation-induced muscle atrophy.

84901460324	Neural tissue engineering options for peripheral nerve regeneration	Tissue engineered nerve grafts (TENGs) have emerged as a potential alternative to autologous nerve grafts, the gold standard for peripheral nerve repair. Typically, TENGs are composed of a biomaterial-based template that incorporates biochemical cues. A number of TENGs have been used experimentally to bridge long peripheral nerve gaps in various animal models, where the desired outcome is nerve tissue regeneration and functional recovery. So far, the translation of TENGs to the clinic for use in humans has met with a certain degree of success. In order to optimize the TENG design and further approach the matching of TENGs with autologous nerve grafts, many new cues, beyond the traditional ones, will have to be integrated into TENGs. Furthermore, there is a strong requirement for monitoring the real-time dynamic information related to the construction of TENGs. The aim of this opinion paper is to specifically and critically describe the latest advances in the field of neural tissue engineering for peripheral nerve regeneration. Here we delineate new attempts in the design of template (or scaffold) materials, especially in the context of biocompatibility, the choice and handling of support cells, and growth factor release systems. We further discuss the significance of RNAi for peripheral nerve regeneration, anticipate the potential application of RNAi reagents for TENGs, and speculate on the possible contributions of additional elements, including angiogenesis, electrical stimulation, molecular inflammatory mediators, bioactive peptides, antioxidant reagents, and cultured biological constructs, to TENGs. Finally, we consider that a diverse array of physicochemical and biological cues must be orchestrated within a TENG to create a self-consistent coordinated system with a close proximity to the regenerative microenvironment of the peripheral nervous system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84902515667	Protein expression profiling during wallerian degeneration after rat sciatic nerve injury	Introduction: Wallerian degeneration (WD) is an important area of research in modern neuroscience. Many protein expressions are regulated by differentially expressed genes in WD, but the precise mechanisms are elusive. Methods: In this study, we profiled differentially expressed proteins in WD after rat sciatic nerve injury using an antibody array. Results: Functional analysis positively identified cell proliferation, regulation of cell proliferation, and immune system processes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed molecular networks related mainly to cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the mitogen-activated proteinkinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, apoptosis, the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, and the Janus kinase (Jak) - signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. Interactions between these differential proteins were well established and regulated by the key factors transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Fas ligand (FasL), and 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha-1 (PRKAA1). Conclusions: These results provide information related to functional analysis of differentially expressed genes during WD. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84906650245	The Regenerating Spinal Cord of Gecko Maintains Unaltered Expression of β-Catenin Following Tail Amputation	The Wingless/Integrated (Wnt) signaling pathway plays important roles in central nervous system (CNS) development and regeneration, and β-catenin, the central component, has been considered in association with adult neurogenesis. To decipher its roles on spontaneous spinal cord regeneration, we cloned β-catenin from Gekko japonicus and examined its function in regenerating spinal cord. The protein was localized in the neurons and oligodendrocytes and maintained a stable expression levels during the spinal cord regeneration. The temporal pattern of expression has been found to be completely distinct with those of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Experiments of gain-of-function by overexpression of full length β-catenin or stabilized ΔN90-β-catenin revealed that the accumulated protein attenuates the elongation of neurites and oligodendrocyte process. Knockdown of endogenous β-catenin, however, decreased proliferation of oligodendrocytes by affecting expression of downstream lef1 and c-jun. The upregulated extracellular matrix fibronectin in injured cord was found to be inefficient in regulation of β-catenin expression. Our results suggest that a tightly regulated stable expression of β-catenin is required for the spontaneous spinal cord regeneration. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84908029677	An active component of Achyranthes bidentata polypeptides provides neuroprotection through inhibition of mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway in cultured neurons and in animal models of cerebral ischemia	An active component has been isolated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) from Achyranthes bidentata Blume polypeptides that are extracted from Achyranthes bidentata Blume, a Chinese medicinal herb. The active component is called ABPPk based on the order of HPLC elution. In this study, we used in vitro and in vivo experimental models of cerebral ischemia to investigate the possible neuroprotective effect of ABPPk. ABPPk treatment promoted neuronal survival and inhibited neuronal apoptosis in primary cortical neurons exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation and in rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. The role of ABPPk in protection against ischemia-induced neuronal damage might be mediated by mitochondrial-dependent pathways, including modulation of apoptosis-related gene expression, regulation of mitochondrial dysfunction through restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors, and inhibiting intracellular ROS production. The neuroprotective effect of ABPPk may suggest the possible use of this agent in the treatment and prevention of cerebral ischemic stroke.

84911890943	Chitosan Degradation Products Promote Nerve Regeneration by Stimulating Schwann Cell Proliferation via miR-27a/FOXO1 Axis	Natural polysaccharides are biomaterials widely used for constructing scaffolds in tissue engineering. While natural polysaccharides have been shown to robustly promote tissue regeneration, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we show that chitooligosaccharides (COS), the intermediate products of chitosan degradation, stimulate peripheral nerve regeneration in rats. Our experiment also shows that COS stimulate the proliferation of Schwann cells (SCs) during nerve regeneration. By analyzing the transcriptome and gene regulatory network, we identified the miR-27a/FOXO1 axis as the main signaling pathway for mediating the proliferative effects of COS on SCs. COS increase the expression level of miR-27a and cause a reduction of FOXO1, which subsequently accelerates the cell cycle and stimulates SC proliferation to stimulate nerve regeneration. These findings define a basic pathway for oligosaccharides-mediated cell proliferation and reveal a novel aspect of polysaccharide biomaterials in tissue engineering.

84914708511	Scar-modulating treatments for central nervous system injury	Traumatic injury to the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) leads to complex cellular responses. Among them, the scar tissue formed is generally recognized as a major obstacle to CNS repair, both by the production of inhibitory molecules and by the physical impedance of axon regrowth. Therefore, scar-modulating treatments have become a leading therapeutic intervention for CNS injury. To date, a variety of biological and pharmaceutical treatments, targeting scar modulation, have been tested in animal models of CNS injury, and a few are likely to enter clinical trials. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the scar-modulating treatments according to their specific aims: (1) inhibition of glial and fibrotic scar formation, and (2) blockade of the production of scar-associated inhibitory molecules. The removal of existing scar tissue is also discussed as a treatment of choice. It is believed that only a combinatorial strategy is likely to help eliminate the detrimental effects of scar tissue on CNS repair.

84919841585	PCAF Improves Glucose Homeostasis by Suppressing the Gluconeogenic Activity of PGC-1α	PGC-1α plays a central role in hepatic gluconeogenesis and has been implicated in the onset of type 2 diabetes. Acetylation is an important posttranslational modification for regulating the transcriptional activity of PGC-1α. Here, we show that PCAF is a pivotal acetyltransferase for acetylating PGC-1α in both fasted and diabetic states. PCAF acetylates two lysine residues K328 and K450 in PGC-1α, whichsubsequently triggers its proteasomal degradation and suppresses its transcriptional activity. Adenoviral-mediated expression of PCAF in the obese mouse liver greatly represses gluconeogenic enzyme activation and glucose production and improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Moreover, liver-specific knockdown of PCAF stimulates PGC-1α activity, resulting in an increase in blood glucose and hepatic glucose output. Our results suggest that PCAF might be a potential pharmacological target for developing agents against metabolic disorders associated with hyperglycemia, such as obesity and diabetes.

10444235669	Effect of nerve regeneration factor on differentiation of PC12 cells and its signaling pathway	The effects of nerve regeneration factor (NRF) on neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells and its signaling pathway are investigated by morphological observation and immunofluorescent cytochemical method, and the activity of ERK1/2 in NRF-treated PC12 cells in absence of serum is also studied by immuno-coprecipitation and Western blot analysis. The MEKl/2-specific inhibitor U0126, the broad-spectrum protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Go6983 and tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) inhibitor genistein were used to determine the roles of the activation of ERK1/2 by NRF and the involvement of certain kinds of PKC or TPK receptor in this activation process. The results show that U0126 and Go6983 inhibit the activation of ERK1/2 by NRF to different extents, while genistein has no effect on it, demonstrating that NRF remarkably induces neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells through activating ERK1/2 in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner.

84921717518	The Achyranthes bidentata polypeptide k fraction enhances neuronal growth in vitro and promotes peripheral nerve regeneration after crush injury in vivo	We have previously shown that Achyranthes bidentata polypeptides (ABPP), isolated from Achyranthes bidentata Blume (a medicinal herb), exhibit neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on the nervous system. To identify the major active component of ABPP, and thus optimize the use of ABPP, we used reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography to separate ABPP. We obtained 12 fractions, among which the fraction of ABPPk demonstrated the strongest neuroactivity. Immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis showed that ABPPk promoted neurite growth in cultured dorsal root ganglion explant and dorsal root ganglion neurons, which might be associated with activation of Erk1/2. A combination of behavioral tests, electrophysiological assessment, and histomorphometric analysis indicated that ABPPk enhanced nerve regeneration and function restoration in a mouse model of crushed sciatic nerve. All the results suggest that ABPPk, as the key component of ABPP, can be used for peripheral nerve repair to yield better outcomes than ABPP.

84923831653	Porous chitosan scaffolds with surface micropatterning and inner porosity and their effects on Schwann cells	Chitosan is found to promote the regeneration of peripheral nerve system in our previous studies, whereas the regeneration speed is not satisfied with clinical request. Micropatterning could promote cell orientation and growth, however, the effect of porous chitosan micropatterning on nerve regeneration is rarely reported. In this study, the porous chitosan micropatterning with surface ridge/groove and inner porosity structure was fabricated using a combination of micromodeling and lyophilization method. The morphology and stability of the prepared chitosan micropatterning were evaluated, the regulation of Schwann cells behavior by chitosan micropatterning was evaluated. The results showed that the chitosan micropatterning displayed stripe-like structure with a clear and complete edge. The micropatterning with 30/30 μm was more stable than 20/20 μm sample. Schwann cells on chitosan micropatterning showed orientation adhesion and began to grow along a certain direction after culture for 2 h, and displayed the minimal orientation angle and the largest length/width ratio on 30/30 μm micropatterning after further culture for 3 d and 5 d, indicating the most obvious cell orientation. Moreover, the secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) demonstrated that the micropatterned chitosan had no negative influence on the physiological function of Schwann cells. Thus, the results indicate that the porous chitosan micropatterning can regulate Schwann cell growth well, which may have potential application in nerve regeneration. The study provides an important basis for constructing porous nerve conduit with micropatterning structure in the inner wall. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
