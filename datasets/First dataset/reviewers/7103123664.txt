84929399714	An effective doa estimation by exploring the spatial sparse representation of the inter-sensor data ratio model	This paper investigates speaker direction of arrival (DOA) estimation using a single acoustic vector sensor (AVS). With the definition of the inter-sensor data ratio (ISDR) in the time-frequency (TF) domain and the use of the high local signal-to-noise ratio (HLSNR) TF points, an effective ISDR data model is derived, which determines the relationship between the ISDR and the AVS manifold vector. With the spatial sparse representation of the ISDR data, the DOA estimation is formulated by recovering the sparse matrix and locating the peak of the power spectrum of the reconstructed sparse matrix. Preliminary experimental results using simulations and real AVS recordings show that the proposed DOA estimation method is able to achieve high elevation and azimuth estimation accuracy for all angles when the SNR is above 10dB, avoiding the spatial aliasing problem and suppressing the adverse impact of the room reverberation. It is expected that the proposed DOA estimation method may find wide applications in portable devices due to its small compact physical size and superior performance.

84940740587	An effective target speech enhancement with single acoustic vector sensor based on the speech time-frequency sparsity	This paper investigates the speech time-frequency (TF) sparsity together with the unique characteristics between the acoustic vector sensors (AVS) to formulate an effective speech enhancement approach under the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion together with a fixed beamformer (FBF). The proposed approach exploits the inter-sensor data ratio (ISDR) of the AVS and time-frequency sparsity of speech to derive a mask that is used to extract and enhance a target speech signal recorded in the presence of a spatially separated interfering speech signal and background noise. Experimental results show that the proposed AVS-ISDRSS algorithm effectively suppresses the spatial interference and additive background noise meanwhile increases the perceptual quality of the target speech. In addition, it is noted that the proposed AVS-ISDRSS algorithm does not require voice activity detection (VAD) for estimating the speech and this greatly reduces the computational complexity.

84942372904	Absolute phase map recovery of two fringe patterns with flexible selection of fringe wavelengths	A novel approach is proposed to unwrap the phase maps of two fringe patterns in fringe pattern projection-based profilometry. In contrast to existing techniques, where spatial frequencies (i.e., the number of fringes on a pattern) of the two fringe patterns must be integers and coprime, the proposed method is applicable for any two fringe patterns with different fringe wavelengths (i.e., the number of pixels in a fringe) and thus provides more flexibility in the use of fringe patterns. Moreover, compared to the existing techniques, the proposed method is simpler in its implementation and has better antierror capability.

17444393275	Multi-frequency and multiple phase-shift sinusoidal fringe projection for 3D profilometry	In this paper, we report on a laser fringe projection set-up, which can generate fringe patterns with multiple frequencies and phase shifts. Stationary fringe patterns with sinusoidal intensity distributions are produced by the interference of two laser beams, which are frequency modulated by a pair of acousto-optic modulators (AOMs). The AOMs are driven by two RF signals with the same frequency but a phase delay between them. By changing the RF frequency and the phase delay, the fringe spatial frequency and phase shift can be electronically controlled, which allows high-speed switching from one frequency or phase to another thus makes a dynamic 3D profiling possible. © 2005 Optical Society of America.

19844369194	Multi-channel FBG sensing system using a dense wavelength division demultiplexing module	Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing is gaining attention in both scientific research areas and engineering applications thanks to its distinguishing advantages including wavelength multiplexing capability, miniature size, high sensitivity, immunity from electro-magnetic interference, etc. FBG sensing is based on the detection of the shifted Bragg wavelength of the light reflected by a fiber grating which is sensitive to various physical parameters such as strain and temperature. One of the challenging tasks in FBG sensing is to determine the Bragg wavelength shift, which can be done by using an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA). An OSA is suitable for laboratory tests, but not an ideal solution for field applications in term of cost and convenience. Different wavelength demodulation methods have been developed for FBG sensing purpose. One of them is employing a bulk linear edge filter to convert the wavelength shifts to intensity variations. This method offers several obvious advantages including low cost and ability for dynamic measurements. However, most of the edge-filter based FBG sensing systems are designed for single-channel measurement. In this study, we propose and develop a multi-channel FBG sensing system based on the edge-filtering technique. In order to demodulate multi-channel signal from FBG sensors, we propose to use a dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) module. The light signals coming from wavelength-multiplexed FBG sensors are demultiplexed into individual channels and demodulated by the pass-band edges. In the present study, a four-channel FBG sensing system has been demonstrated.

18944364913	Measuring the linewidth enhancement factor of semiconductor lasers based on weak optical feedback effect	Semiconductor lasers are very different from other lasers because refraction variation can't be avoided when the gain is changed. Refraction variation can be introduced the theory of semiconductor laser by a dimensional parameter α. This parameter is called linewidth enhancement factor (LEF). The value of LEF is very important for many aspects of laser behavior. The LEF characterizes the linewidth broadening and chirp due to fluctuation in the carrier density. A simple method to measure the linewidth enhancement factor of laser diodes is presented in this paper. The method uses the self-mixing effect at a weak feedback level. An optical beam is reflected and injected into the laser diode cavity by an external target, and is then mixed with the light inside the cavity, causing variations of the optical output power. The waveform of the optical power is determined by the feedback factor C and the LEF. A theoretical formula to compute LEF is proposed for the case when the feedback level C is smaller than 1. The experimental results show this method is feasible when a laser diode operates at single longitudinal mode.

In this study, experimental evaluation of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors for strain measurements in a seven-wire prestressed steel strand has been carried out. An installation technique of FBG sensors has been developed to fulfill the special requirements of the prestressed steel strand. The experiment results show that fiber Bragg gratings can represent the overall stress of the prestressed steel strand without being affected by the specific structure of the strand when it is only fixed on one wire. It is also demonstrated that the maximum strain that the FBG sensor can measure is 6260 με , while the prestressed steel strand usually endures the strain greater than 10000 με . This means that an offset of about 4000 με is necessary to measure the maximum strain that the strand could experience in its applications.

Different methods have been proposed and demonstrated to fabricate two- or three-dimensional photonic crystal structures. Among them, the holographic lithography method, in which multi-beam interference is employed, offers a number of advantages. These include the ability to create a large volume of uniform periodic structures through an irradiation process, and more degrees of freedom to control the structures. In this study, a model is presented for predicting the multi-dimensional photonic crystal structures formed using multi-beam interference. Various parameters, including beam propagation and polarization directions, beam intensities, and phase shifts are considered. Calculations have been carried out to simulate two four-beam configurations which have been popularly used in the fabrication of photonic crystals. It has been demonstrated that the contours of the interference pattern are related to the polarization states, the intensity ratios among the four beams, and the phase delays. Therefore, by controlling the beam intensities, polarization directions, and phase delays, different structures can be obtained. The results presented in this study provide a useful guide for choosing various optical parameters and selecting suitable photoresists to fabricate 2D and 3D photonic crystal structures. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.

33644639701	A contrast between DLP and LCD digital projection technology for triangulation based phase measuring optical profilometers	With the growing demand for high speed and dynamic 3D profiling for applications such as animation, face recognition and machine vision, we have seen Digital Video Projection (DVP) emerge as the preferred projection technology. In addition to the robust qualities DVP sources offer, many researchers are adopting the technology on the merits of higher resolutions, contrast ratios and sharper images, all of which are characteristic of the highly developing projection technology. However, in regard to the specific application of triangulation based optical profilometers, DVP lacks predominantly in pattern geometric structure and also suffers from colour channel coupling issues. The purpose of this paper is to review the functionality and contrast the two chief DVP technologies, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and Digital Light Processing (DLP) from the specific viewpoint of a triangulation based phase measuring profilometer. Experimental verification of the performance of each projection technology is provided and finally some suggestions on projection technologies for single and multichannel phase measuring profilometry applications is offered.

34250699449	Toward automatic measurement of the linewidth-enhancement factor using optical feedback self-mixing interferometry with weak optical feedback	This paper proposes an approach for automatically measuring the linewidth-enhancement factor (LEF) of semiconductor lasers using optical feedback self-mixing interferometry (OFSMI), which works in weak optical feedback regime and where the external target is subject to simple harmonic vibration with unknown vibration frequency and magnitude. According to well-known Lang-Kobayashi theory the waveform of the modulated optical output power from the OFSMI system is influenced by multiple parameters, including the LEF, the optical feedback level factor, and the parameters related to the movement of external target. In order to estimate LEF, other parameters must also be considered and, hence, a multiple parameter estimation strategy is required. We propose a solution for this multiple parameter estimation problem based on the principle of data-to-theoretical model match. In particular, a strategy for minimizing a cost function in order to achieve the best fitting is proposed with which all the unknown parameters can be estimated. The performance of the proposed approach is tested using experimental data in comparison with other two approaches. It is seen that, over different experimental signals, the standard deviation for estimated LEF is less than 4.58% on average, which shows that results have excellent consistency. Moreover, the proposed approach also provides a solution for vibration measurement (that is, vibration frequency and magnitude). © 2007 IEEE.

Firstly, a general framework of JD-based blind source separation (BSS) is reviewed and summarized. Special emphasis is put on the separability conditions of sources and mixing system. Secondly, the JD-based BSS is generalized to the separation of convolutive mixtures. The definition of a time and frequency dependent characteristic matrix of sources allows us to state the conditions under which the separation of convolutive mixtures is possible. Lastly, a frequency-domain approach is proposed for convolutive mixture separation. The proposed approach exploits objective functions based on a set of PSDMs. These objective functions are defined in the frequency domain, but are jointly optimized with respect to the time-domain coefficients of the unmixing system. The local permutation ambiguity problems, which are inherent to most frequency-domain approaches, are effectively avoided with the proposed algorithm.

69249205502	Inverse function analysis method for fringe pattern profilometry	In this paper, we present a mathematical model that describes a general relationship between the projected signal and the deformed signal in fringe pattern profilometry (FPP) systems. The derived mathematical model proves that in theory any kind of fringe pattern could be utilized for profilometry. Based on the derived mathematical model, this paper also proposes a new algorithm, referred to as inverse function analysis (IFA) method, to reconstruct 3-D surfaces using the FPP technique. Compared with traditional methods, our algorithm has neither the requirement for the structure of projected fringe patterns nor the prior knowledge of the distortion characteristics of projection systems. The correctness of the proposed mathematical model and IFA method has been confirmed by simulation results, which are provided to demonstrate that compared with the conventional analysis methods, the measurement accuracy has been significantly improved by the IFA method, particularly when the expected sinusoidal fringe patterns are distorted by unknown factors. © 2009 IEEE.

A sensing signal observed from the OFSMI system is called self-mixing signal (SMS). The paper studies the waveform features of the SMSs and proposes an algorithm for reconstructing the displacement of a moving target. The reconstruction accuracy of the algorithm mainly depends on the locating accuracy for those characteristic points on a SMS.

78650894282	FPGA-based signal processing in an optical feedback self-mixing interferometry system	Optical feedback Self-mixing Interferometry (OFSMI) can achieve a high-resolution displacement sensing and measurement by using advanced digital signal processing. However, most existing signal processing algorithms used for OFSMI signals are implemented on a PC by Matlab or other programming languages. In this case, the whole structure of OFSMI sensing system is incompact and the measurement is in low speed. The design trends in sensing systems are towarding to small size, high integration and fast real time processing. These trends require us to improve the existing OFSMI design. It is a good solution to apply Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) technique onto OFSMI sensing systems. In this work, we designed a FPGA based signal processing unit for an OFSMI displacement sensing system. The OFSMI sensing signals observed from an OFSMI system is connected to a FPGA development board (Spartan-3E) for high speed signal processing. The FPGA processing unit retrieves the displacement information carried in the OFSMI signals. The FPGA design includes noise reduction, signal peak detection and impulse magnitude tracking. As the magnitude of the sensing signal is time-varying, for adapting the variation, a dynamic updating algorithm is introduced in the magnitude tracking unit. Both simulation and hardware co-simulation show that the OFSMI system with a FPGA based signal processing unit can achieve fast and reliable displacement sensing. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

84872951363	3D profile measurement based on estimation of spatial shifts between intensity ratios from multiple-step triangular patterns	This paper presents a multiple-step triangular-pattern spatial shift estimation approach for 3D object profilometry measurement. The proposed technique is based on the intensity ratio maps, but, compared to existing intensity ratio approaches, it employs spatial shift estimation to work out the 3D shape. The spatial shift is determined by making use of the inverse function of the intensity ratio map obtained from the reference plane, which is obtained by the least-square polynomial fitting technique. In contrast to existing intensity ratio approaches, the proposed method does not suffer from the influence of the nonlinear distortion associated with digital projection. Also, compared to the existing phase shifting method with phase error correction, the proposed technique is simple and thus is more suitable for fast measurement. The performance of the proposed technique has been tested and the advantages have been demonstrated by experiments. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84875827014	An approach to compensate the object movement errors in phase shifting profilometry	Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) technique is widely used as a 3-D shape measurement technique due to its robustness and accuracy. However, PSP requires multiple fringe pattern images to be projected onto an object and a reference plane to calculate the phase value, and also the object must maintain motionless when the measurement is taken. If the object moves during the measurement, significant errors will be introduced when calculating the phase value. This paper analyses the relationship between the object movement and the phase value, and proposes a method for compensating the errors caused by two-dimensional movement of object. This method can eliminate the errors caused by two-dimensional movement of object and reconstruct the object shape successfully.

84875854644	A composite quality-guided phase unwrapping algorithm for fast 3D profile measurement	Fringe pattern profilometry (FPP) is one of the most promising 3D profile measurement techniques, which has been widely applied in many areas. A challenge problem associated with FPP is the unwrapping of wrapped phase maps resulted from complex object surface shapes. Although existing quality-guided phase unwrapping algorithms are able to solve such a problem, they are usually extensively computational expensive and not able to be applied to fast 3D measurement scenarios. This paper proposes a new quality-guided phase unwrapping algorithm with higher computational efficiency than the conventional ones. In the proposed method, a threshold of quality value is used to classify pixels on the phase maps into two types: high quality (HQ) pixels corresponding to smooth phase changes and low quality (LQ) ones to rough phase variance. In order to improve the computational efficiency, the HQ pixels are unwrapped by a computationally efficient fast phase unwrapping algorithm, and the LQ pixels are unwrapped by computational expensive flood-fill algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed approach is able to recover complex phase maps with the similar accuracy performance as the conventional quality-guided phase unwrapping algorithm but is much faster than the later. © 2012 SPIE.

We present an efficient correlation fringe pattern generation method based on the orientation partial differential equation, which derives the fringe pattern with smooth fringes without speckle noise from two original speckle patterns. The average calculations in the correlation method are replaced by the anisotropic filter provided by the oriented partial differential equation. Because the filter along fringe orientation for the entire image can be simply realized based on the oriented partial differential equation, our method does not spoil the phase distribution, and needs not calculate each gray average in the corresponding filter window pixel by pixel. The experimental results show that it is an effective fringe pattern generation method for electronic speckle pattern interferometry. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

As phase unwrapping errors are often caused by shadows on fringe patterns images and object surface discontinuities, we propose to identify both of them. An image of the object is acquired by averaging the fringe patterns reflected from the object surface, based on which shadow areas and the phase discontinuities are identified. When carrying out phase unwrapping, the shadow areas and the edge pixels will be isolated, and then the remaining areas are unwrapped by means of an efficient technique proposed below. All the remaining pixels are then unwrapped by an efficient technique proposed, by which, the computational efficiency can be significantly improved. As proven by the experiment results, the proposed approach is able to implement fast and reliable phase unwrapping. © 2013 IEEE.

84890490974	Multisource DOA estimation based on time-frequency sparsity and joint inter-sensor data ratio with single acoustic vector sensor	By exploring the time-frequency (TF) sparsity property of the speech, the inter-sensor data ratios (ISDRs) of single acoustic vector sensor (AVS) have been derived and investigated. Under noiseless condition, ISDRs have favorable properties, such as being independent of frequency, DOA related with single valuedness, and no constraints on near or far field conditions. With these observations, we further investigated the behavior of ISDRs under noisy conditions and proposed a so-called ISDR-DOA estimation algorithm, where high local SNR data extraction and bivariate kernel density estimation techniques have been adopted to cluster the ISDRs representing the DOA information. Compared with the traditional DOA estimation methods with a small microphone array, the proposed algorithm has the merits of smaller size, no spatial aliasing and less computational cost. Simulation studies show that the proposed method with a single AVS can estimate up to seven sources simultaneously with high accuracy when the SNR is larger than 15dB. In addition, the DOA estimation results based on recorded data further validates the proposed algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.

The removal of speckle noise is fundamental to extract measurement information accurately. In this letter, two filtering methods based on the oriented feature of ESPI fringes, i.e., the second-order oriented partial differential equation (SOOPDE) and oriented, regularized quadratic-cost function filtering methods, are first proven to be consistent. An important question in solving partial differential equation, i.e., how to select suitable parameters in an adaptive manner, is then discussed. The computer-simulated and experimentally obtained ESPI fringe patterns and phase map are processed by the SOOPDE filtering model with adaptive selective parameters. The qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the parameters selected by the adaptive method are effective and suitable for the SOOPDE filtering model. © 2013 Chinese Optics Letters.

84901816225	Speech enhancement with an acoustic vector sensor: An effective adaptive beamforming and post-filtering approach	Speech enhancement has an increasing demand in mobile communications and faces a great challenge in a real ambient noisy environment. This paper develops an effective spatial-frequency domain speech enhancement method with a single acoustic vector sensor (AVS) in conjunction with minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) spatial filtering and Wiener post-filtering (WPF) techniques. In remote speech applications, the MVDR spatial filtering is effective in suppressing the strong spatial interferences and the Wiener post-filtering is considered as a popular and powerful estimator to further suppress the residual noise if the power spectral density (PSD) of target speech can be estimated properly. With the favorable directional response of the AVS together with the trigonometric relations of the steering vectors, the closed-form estimation of the signal PSDs is derived and the frequency response of the optimal Wiener post-filter is determined accordingly. Extensive computer simulations and a real experiment in an anechoic chamber condition have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method offers good ability to suppress the spatial interference while maintaining comparable log spectral deviation and perceptual evaluation of speech quality performance compared with the conventional methods with several objective measures. Moreover, a single AVS solution is particularly attractive for hands-free speech applications due to its compact size. © 2014 Zou et al.; licensee Springer.

The 3D-GPF (Three Dimensional Global Phase Filtering) global phase filtering method is proposed based on the study of phase filtering method, consisting of the steps below. Firstly, the six-step phase shift profilometry is used to obtain the local phase information, and encoding the obtained phase information. Through the global phase unwrapping method, the global phase can be acquired. Secondly, 3D-GPF method is used for the obtained global phase. Finally, the effect of 3D reconstruction is analyzed after the global phase filtering. Experimental results indicate that the noisy points of three-dimensional graphics is reduced 98.02%, the speed of 3D reconstruction is raised 12%.The effect of the proposed global phase filtering method is better than DCT and GSM methods.

To avoid the rate loss, a low complexity SISO MSK demodulator is derived based on a new factor graph for MSK, which is found to have comparable complexity to the suboptimal demodulator. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is equivalent to the BCJR algorithm and thus achieves optimal performance.

84922864703	Experimental study for the influence of surface characteristics on the fringe patterns	Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) has been widely used for three dimensional (3D) imaging and measurement. The fringe acquisition of FPP mainly depends on the diffuse light from the surface of objects, thus the characteristics of object surface have significant influence on phase calculation. One of the essential factors related to phase precision is modulation index, which has a direct relationship with the surface reflectivity. This paper presents a comparative study which focuses on the modulation index of different materials. The distribution of modulation index for different samples is statistical analyzed, which leads to the conclusion that the modulation index is determined by the diffuse reflectivity rather than the type of materials. This work is helpful to the development of effective de-noising algorithms to improve the measurement accuracy.

E can be obtained from the resonant frequency from the vibration of the tested material sample excited by the external forces. In this paper, we present a system design for determining the parameter by using an optical feedback self-mixing interferometry (OFSMI) system. An OFSMI system consists of a laser diode (LD), a micro-lens and an external target. The material sample to be tested is used as the external target. The vibration of the sample causes the variation of the length of the external cavity, and then causes a modulated laser power of the LD. The modulation contains the vibration information of the tested samples. The OFSMI system can achieve high measurement accuracy with an extremely simple and inexpensive set-up, thus can be thought as a good candidate for the evaluation of material properties. The system design in this work includes the mechanical part for holding and exciting the tested samples and the optical part for picking up the vibration information from the samples. In order to accurately determinate E, the exclusive supporting system is used for holding the material sample of specific dimension. The complex waveform of the LD output power is studied and simulated by using our proposed system model. The proposed method is verified by simulation and experiments, and satisfied accuracy of the experiments is achieved.

By using the properties of Gaussian functions, an approximate approach to the APP detection is devised with the idea that, in the computation of the APP of each symbol, the remaining symbols are distinguished based on their contributions to the APP of the concerned symbol, and the symbols with less contributions are approximated as (continuous) Gaussian variables [hence the name partial Gaussian approximation (PGA)] to reduce the computational complexity. The connection between the PGA detector and the reduced dimension maximum a posteriori detector (RDMAP) is investigated. It is shown that, PGA is equivalent to RDMAP, but it has a complexity much lower than that of RDMAP, i.e., PGA can be regarded as an efficient implementation of RDMAP. In addition, the application of PGA in intersymbol interference (ISI) channel equalization is also investigated. We show that PGA allows further significant complexity reduction by exploiting the circulant structure of the system transfer matrix, which makes PGA very attractive in handling severe ISI channels with large memory length.
