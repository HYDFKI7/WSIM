84926615259	Search for scalar top quark production in (Formula presented.) collisions at (Formula presented.) = 1.96 TeV	We report on a search for the supersymmetric partner of the top quark (scalar top) decaying into a charm quark and a neutralino in (Formula presented.) collisions at (Formula presented.) = 1.96TeV. The data sample, collected by the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb<sup>−1</sup>. Candidate events are selected by requiring two or more jets and a large imbalance in the transverse momentum. To enhance the analysis sensitivity, at least one of the jets is required to be identified as originating from a charm quark using an algorithm specifically designed for this analysis. The selected events are in good agreement with standard model predictions. In the case of large mass splitting between the scalar top quark and the neutralino we exclude a scalar top quark mass below 180 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> at 95% confidence level.

34347383743	Measurement of the top-quark mass using missing ET+jets events with secondary vertex b-tagging at CDF II	We present a measurement of the top-quark mass in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV which uses events with an inclusive signature of missing transverse energy and jets. The event selection is sensitive to tt̄→W+bW- b̄→lνbqq′b̄ independent of the lepton flavor and results in a large acceptance for W→τν decays. All-hadronic tt̄ decays and events with identified electrons or muons are vetoed to provide a statistically independent sample with respect to all previous measurements. The top-quark mass is inferred from the distribution of the scalar sum of all jet transverse energies and the missing transverse energy. Using 311pb-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab, we measure a top-quark mass mt=172.3-9.6+10.8(stat)±10.8(syst)GeV/c2. While the uncertainty on mt is larger than that of other measurements, the result is statistically uncorrelated with those of other methods and thus can help to reduce the overall mt uncertainty when combined with other existing measurements. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34548753335	Search for heavy long-lived particles that decay to photons at CDF II	We present the first search for heavy, long-lived particles that decay to photons at a hadron collider. We use a sample of Î+jet+missing transverse energy events in pp collisions at s=1.96 TeV taken with the CDF II detector. Candidate events are selected based on the arrival time of the photon at the detector. Using an integrated luminosity of 570pb-1 of collision data, we observe 2 events, consistent with the background estimate of 1.3 0.7 events. While our search strategy does not rely on model-specific dynamics, we set cross section limits in a supersymmetric model with I E 10 GE and place the world-best 95% C.L. lower limit on the Ï‡Ëœ10 mass of 101 GeV/c2 at Ï.,Ï‡Ëœ10=5ns. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The analysis is performed using a data sample with an integrated luminosity of about 800pb-1 collected by the CDF II detector. For both vector mesons, we find that the polarizations become increasingly longitudinal as pT increases from 5 to 30GeV/c. These results are compared to the predictions of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics and other contemporary models. The effective polarizations of J/ψ and ψ(2S) mesons from B-hadron decays are also reported. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

35948994597	Precise measurement of the top-quark mass in the lepton+jets topology at CDF II	We present a measurement of the mass of the top quark from proton-antiproton collisions recorded at the CDF experiment in Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron. We analyze events from the single lepton plus jets final state (tt̄→W+bW-b̄→lνbqq̄′b̄). The top-quark mass is extracted using a direct calculation of the probability density that each event corresponds to the tt̄ final state. The probability is a function of both the mass of the top quark and the energy scale of the calorimeter jets, which is constrained in situ by the hadronic W boson mass. Using 167 events observed in 955pb-1 of integrated luminosity, we achieve the single most precise measurement of the top-quark mass, 170.8±2.2(stat.) ±1.4(syst.)GeV/c2. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

35448931078	Search for new particles leading to Z+jets final states in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present the results of a search for new particles that lead to a Z boson plus jets in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV using the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II). A data sample with a luminosity of 1.06fb-1 collected using Z boson decays to ee and μμ is used. We describe a completely data-based method to predict the dominant background from standard model Z+jet events. This method can be similarly applied to other analyses requiring background predictions in multijet environments, as shown when validating the method by predicting the background from W+jets in tt̄ production. No significant excess above the background prediction is observed, and a limit is set using a fourth generation quark model to quantify the acceptance. Assuming BR(b′→bZ)=100% and using a leading-order calculation of the b′ cross section, b′ quark masses below 268GeV/c2 are excluded at 95% confidence level. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We find the diphoton mass spectrum to be in agreement with the standard model expectation, and set limits on the cross section times branching ratio for the Randall-Sundrum graviton, as a function of diphoton mass. We subsequently derive lower limits for the graviton mass of 230GeV/c2 and 850GeV/c2, at the 95% confidence level, for coupling parameters (k/M̄Pl) of 0.01 and 0.1, respectively. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

No significant evidence of such a resonance is observed and we interpret the results to exclude the standard-model-like Z′ with a mass below 923GeV/c2 and the Randall-Sundrum graviton with a mass below 807GeV/c2 for k/M̄pl=0.1, both at the 95% confidence level.

35548967881	Searches for direct pair production of supersymmetric top and supersymmetric bottom quarks in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We search for direct pair production of supersymmetric top quarks and supersymmetric bottom quarks in proton-antiproton collisions at s=1.96TeV, using 295pb-1 of data recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II) experiment. The supersymmetric top (supersymmetric bottom) quarks are selected by reconstructing their decay into a charm (bottom) quark and a neutralino, which is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle. The signature of such processes is two energetic heavy-flavor jets and missing transverse energy. The number of events that pass our selection for each search process is consistent with the expected standard model background. By comparing our results to the theoretical production cross sections of the supersymmetric top and supersymmetric bottom quarks in the minimal supersymmetric standard model, we exclude, at a 95% confidence level in the frame of that model, a supersymmetric top quark mass up to 132GeV/c2 for a neutralino mass of 48GeV/c2, and a supersymmetric bottom quark mass up to 193GeV/c2 for a neutralino mass of 40GeV/c2. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We select events with six or more jets on which a number of kinematical requirements are imposed by means of a neural network algorithm. At least one of these jets must be identified as initiated by a b-quark candidate by the reconstruction of a secondary vertex. The cross section is measured to be σtt̄=8.3±1.0(stat)-1.5+2.0(syst) ±0.5(lumi)pb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction.

The event signature requires two electromagnetic showers, each with transverse energy ET>5GeV and pseudorapidity |η|<1.0, with no other particles detected in the event. Three candidate events are observed. We discuss the consistency of the three events with γγ, π0π0, or ηη production. The probability that other processes fluctuate to 3 events is 1.7×10-4.

In this search one W decays to leptons, and the other boson (W or Z) decays hadronically.

The search uses a data sample corresponding to approximately 1fb-1 of integrated luminosity. Events consistent with the W→ ν and H→bb̄ signature are selected by triggering on a high-pT electron or muon candidate and tagging one or two of the jet candidates as having originated from b quarks. A neural network filter rejects a fraction of tagged charm and light-flavor jets, increasing the b-jet purity in the sample. We observe no excess νbb̄ production beyond the background expectation, and we set 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction σ(pp̄→WH)Br(H→bb̄) ranging from 3.9 to 1.3 pb, for specific Higgs boson mass hypotheses in the range 110 to 150GeV/c2, respectively. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 320pb-1 collected with the CDF II detector. W bosons are identified in their electron decay channel and jets are reconstructed using a cone algorithm. For each W+≥n-jet sample (n=1-4) we measure the differential cross section dσ(pp̄→W+≥ n-jet)/dETnth-jet×B(W→eν) with respect to the transverse energy ET of the nth-highest ET jet above 20GeV, and the total cross section σ(pp̄→W+≥n-jet;ETnth-jet>25GeV)×B(W→eν), for a restricted W→eν decay phase space. The cross sections, corrected for all detector effects, can be directly compared to particle level W+jet(s) predictions.

For fully reconstructed candidate tt̄ events triggered on leptons with large transverse momentum and containing at least one identified b-quark jet, we compare the invariant mass spectrum of tt̄ pairs to the expected superposition of standard model tt̄, non-tt̄ backgrounds, and a simple resonance model based on a sequential Z′ boson. We establish upper limits for σ(pp̄→Z′) ·Br(Z′→tt̄) in the Z′ mass interval from 450GeV/c2 to 900GeV/c2. A topcolor leptophobic Z′ is ruled out below 720GeV/c2, and the cross section of any narrow Z′-like state decaying to tt̄ is found to be less than 0.64 pb at 95% C.L. for MZ′ above 700GeV/c2. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

Using a data sample of 310pb-1 collected by the Run II Collider Detector at Fermilab at s=1.96TeV, exclusive cross sections for events with two jets of transverse energy ETjet≥10GeV have been measured as a function of minimum ETjet. The exclusive signal is extracted from fits to data distributions based on Monte Carlo simulations of expected dijet signal and background shapes. The simulated background distribution shapes are checked in a study of a largely independent data sample of 200pb-1 of b-tagged jet events, where exclusive dijet production is expected to be suppressed by the Jz=0 total angular momentum selection rule. Results obtained are compared with theoretical expectations, and implications for exclusive Higgs boson production at the pp Large Hadron Collider at s=14TeV are discussed. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

79952296234	Measurement of the B	The collection of a large number of B-hadron decays to hadronic final states at the CDF II Detector is possible due to the presence of a trigger that selects events based on track impact parameters. However, the nature of the selection requirements of the trigger introduces a large bias in the observed proper-decay-time distribution. A lifetime measurement must correct for this bias, and the conventional approach has been to use a Monte Carlo simulation. The leading sources of systematic uncertainty in the conventional approach are due to differences between the data and the Monte Carlo simulation. In this paper, we present an analytic method for bias correction without using simulation, thereby removing any uncertainty due to the differences between data and simulation.

Using a procedure to associate jets to decay products of the top quarks, the differential cross section of the (Formula presented.) production is determined as a function of the additional jet multiplicity in the lepton+jets channel.

A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 nb<sup>−1</sup> was collected using the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The dijet transverse momentum balance, azimuthal angle correlations, and pseudorapidity distributions are studied as a function of the transverse energy in the forward calorimeters (E<sup>4<|η|<5.2</sup> <inf>T</inf>). For pPb collisions, the dijet transverse momentum ratio and the width of the distribution of dijet azimuthal angle difference are comparable to the same quantities obtained from a simulated pp reference and insensitive to E<sup>4<|η|<5.2</sup> <inf>T</inf>. In contrast, the mean value of the dijet pseudorapidity is found to change monotonically with increasing E<sup>4<|η|<5.2</sup> <inf>T</inf>, indicating a correlation between the energy emitted at large pseudorapidity and the longitudinal motion of the dijet frame. The pseudorapidity distribution of the dijet system in minimum bias pPb collisions is compared with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD predictions obtained from both nucleon and nuclear parton distribution functions, and the data more closely match the latter.

42449091495	Measurement of ratios of fragmentation fractions for bottom hadrons in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	This paper describes the first measurement of b-quark fragmentation fractions into bottom hadrons in Run II of the Tevatron Collider at Fermilab. The result is based on a 360pb-1 sample of data collected with the CDF II detector in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV. Semileptonic decays of B̄0, B-, and B̄s0 mesons, as well as Λb0 baryons, are reconstructed. For an effective bottom hadron pT threshold of 7GeV/c, the fragmentation fractions are measured to be fu/fd=1.054±0.018(stat)-0.045+0.025(sys)±0. 058(B), fs/(fu+fd)=0.160±0.005(stat)-0.010+0.011(sys)-0.034+0.057(B), and fΛb/(fu+fd)=0.281±0.012(stat)-0.056+0.058(sys)-0.087+0.128(B), where the uncertainty B is due to uncertainties on measured branching ratios. The value of fs/(fu+fd) agrees within one standard deviation with previous CDF measurements and the world average of this quantity, which is dominated by LEP measurements. However, the ratio fΛb/(fu+fd) is approximately twice the value previously measured at LEP. The approximately 2σ discrepancy is examined in terms of kinematic differences between the two production environments. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

Results are obtained for charged particles within a restricted cone with an opening angle of 0.5 radians around the jet axis and for events with dijet masses between 66 and 563GeV/c2. A comparison of the experimental data to theoretical predictions obtained for partons within the framework of resummed perturbative QCD in the next-to-leading log approximation shows that the parton momentum correlations survive the hadronization stage of jet fragmentation, giving further support to the hypothesis of local parton-hadron duality.

44449152956	Search for the higgs boson in events with missing transverse energy and b quark jets produced in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with an electroweak vector boson in events with no identified charged leptons, large imbalance in transverse momentum, and two jets where at least one contains a secondary vertex consistent with the decay of b hadrons. We use ∼1fb-1 integrated luminosity of pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab II experiment at the Tevatron. We find 268 (16) single (double) b-tagged candidate events, where 248±43 (14.4±2.7) are expected from standard model background processes. We observe no significant excess over the expected background and thus set 95% confidence level upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross section for several Higgs boson masses ranging from 110 to 140GeV/c2. For a mass of 115GeV/c2, the observed (expected) limit is 20.4 (14.2) times the standard model prediction. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

44349192099	Strong evidence for ZZ production in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We report the first evidence of Z boson pair production at a hadron collider with a significance exceeding 4 standard deviations. This result is based on a data sample corresponding to 1.9fb-1 of integrated luminosity from pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV collected with the Collider Detector at Fermilab II detector. In the ′ ′ channel, we observe three ZZ candidates with an expected background of 0.096-0.063+0.092 events. In the νν channel, we use a leading-order calculation of the relative ZZ and WW event probabilities to discriminate between signal and background. In the combination of ′ ′ and νν channels, we observe an excess of events with a probability of 5.1×10-6 to be due to the expected background. This corresponds to a significance of 4.4 standard deviations. The measured cross section is σ(pp̄→ZZ)=1.4-0.6+0.7(stat+syst)pb, consistent with the standard model expectation. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

Rather than focusing on particular new physics scenarios, CDF data are analyzed for discrepancies with respect to the standard model prediction. A model-independent approach (Vista) considers the gross features of the data and is sensitive to new large cross section physics. A quasi-model-independent approach (Sleuth) searches for a significant excess of events with large summed transverse momentum and is particularly sensitive to new electroweak scale physics that appears predominantly in one final state.

Using an integrated luminosity of 570±34pb-1 of pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV, we select γ+jet+missing transverse energy candidate events based on the arrival time of a high-energy photon at the electromagnetic calorimeter as measured with a timing system that was recently installed on the CDF II detector. We find 2 events, consistent with the background estimate of 1.3±0.7 events.

The measurement was made using the cone-based midpoint jet clustering algorithm in the rapidity region of |y|<2.1. The results are consistent with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD predictions based on recent parton distribution functions (PDFs), and are expected to provide increased precision in PDFs at high parton momentum fraction x. The results are also compared to the recent inclusive jet cross section measurement using the kT jet clustering algorithm, and we find that the ratio of the cross sections measured with the two algorithms is in agreement with theoretical expectations over a large range of jet transverse momentum and rapidity. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

55149086109	Measurement of b-jet shapes in inclusive jet production in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present a measurement of the shapes of b-jets using 300pb-1 of data obtained with the upgraded Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II) in pp̄ collisions at center-of-mass energy s=1.96TeV. This measurement covers a wide transverse momentum range, from 52 to 300GeV/c. Samples of heavy-flavor enhanced jets together with inclusive jets are used to extract the average shapes of b-jets. The b-jets are expected to be broader than inclusive jets. Moreover, b-jets containing a single b-quark are expected to be narrower than those containing a bb̄ pair from gluon splitting. The measured b-jet shapes are found to be significantly broader than expected from the pythia and herwig Monte Carlo simulations. This effect may arise from an underestimation of the fraction of b-jets originating from gluon splitting in these simulations. The jet shape distributions provided in this paper could be compared to any full Monte Carlo simulation and could be used to further constrain the various parameters. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

In an R-parity conserving minimal supergravity scenario with A0=0, μ<0, and tan β=5, 95 C.L. upper limits on the production cross sections in the range between 0.1 and 1 pb are obtained, depending on the squark and gluino masses considered.

64349124232	Search for new physics in the μμ+e/μ+E T channel with a low-pT lepton threshold at the Collider Detector at Fermilab	A search for new physics using three-lepton (trilepton) data collected with the CDF II detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 976 pb-1 is presented. The standard model predicts a low rate of trilepton events, which makes some supersymmetric processes, such as chargino-neutralino production, measurable in this channel. The μμ+ signature is investigated, where ℓ is an electron or a muon, with the additional requirement of large missing transverse energy. In this analysis, the lepton transverse momenta with respect to the beam direction (pT) are as low as 5GeV/c, a selection that improves the sensitivity to particles that are light as well as to ones that result in leptonically decaying tau leptons. At the same time, this low-pT selection presents additional challenges due to the non-negligible heavy-quark background at low lepton momenta. This background is measured with an innovative technique using experimental data. Several dimuon and trilepton control regions are investigated, and good agreement between experimental results and standard-model predictions is observed. In the signal region, we observe one three-muon event and expect 0.4±0.1μμ+ events from standard-model processes. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

This ratio is also measured differentially in jet ET, jet η, Z-boson transverse momentum, number of jets, and number of b jets.

This is the first measurement of the top quark mass using top-antitop pair candidate events in the lepton+jets and dilepton decay channels simultaneously. We reconstruct two observables in each channel and use a nonparametric kernel density estimation technique to derive two-dimensional probability density functions from simulated signal and background samples. The observables are the top quark mass and the invariant mass of two jets from the W decay in the lepton+jets channel, and the top quark mass and the scalar sum of transverse energy of the event in the dilepton channel. We perform a simultaneous fit for the top quark mass and the jet energy scale, which is constrained in situ by the hadronic W boson mass. Using 332 lepton+jets candidate events and 144 dilepton candidate events, we measure the top quark mass to be Mtop=171.9±1. 7(stat+JES)±1.1(othersyst)GeV/c2=171.9±2.0GeV/c2. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

We analyze a sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.9fb-1. We select events with an electron or muon, large missing transverse energy, and exactly four high-energy jets in the central region of the detector, at least one of which is tagged as coming from a b quark. We calculate a signal likelihood using a matrix element integration method, where the matrix element is modified by using effective propagators to take into account assumptions on event kinematics. Our event likelihood is a function of mt and a parameter JES (jet energy scale) that determines in situ the calibration of the jet energies. We use a neural network discriminant to distinguish signal from background events. We also apply a cut on the peak value of each event likelihood curve to reduce the contribution of background and badly reconstructed events. Using the 318 events that pass all selection criteria, we find mt=172.7±1.8(stat+JES) ±1.2(syst)GeV/c2. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

Results are obtained for charged particles in a cone of 0.5 radians around the jet axis in events with dijet invariant masses between 66 and 737GeV/c2. The experimental data are compared to theoretical predictions obtained for fragmentation partons within the framework of resummed perturbative QCD using the modified leading log and next-to-modified leading log approximations.

66149170238	Search for the decays B(s)0→e+μ- and B(s)0→e+e- in CDF run II	We report results from a search for the lepton flavor violating decays Bs0→e+μ- and B0→e+μ-, and the flavor-changing neutral-current decays Bs0→e+e- and B0→e+e-. The analysis uses data corresponding to 2fb-1 of integrated luminosity of pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV collected with the upgraded Collider Detector (CDF II) at the Fermilab Tevatron. The observed number of B0 and Bs0 candidates is consistent with background expectations. The resulting Bayesian upper limits on the branching ratios at 90% credibility level are B(Bs0→e+μ-)<2.0×10-7, B(B0→e+μ-)<6.4×10-8, B(Bs0→e+e-)<2.8×10-7, and B(B0→e+e-)<8.3×10-8. From the limits on B(B(s)0→e+μ-), the following lower bounds on the Pati-Salam leptoquark masses are also derived: MLQ(Bs0→e+μ-)>47.8TeV/c2, and MLQ(B0→e+μ-)>59.3TeV/c2, at 90% credibility level. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The measured dijet mass spectrum is found to be consistent with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD predictions, and no significant evidence of new particles is found. We set upper limits at the 95% confidence level on cross sections times the branching fraction for the production of new particles decaying into dijets with both jets having a rapidity magnitude |y| <1.

66349137931	Measurement of the top quark mass at CDF using the "neutrino ø weighting" template method on a lepton plus isolated track sample	We present a measurement of the top quark mass with tt̄ dilepton events produced in pp̄ collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron (s=1.96TeV) and collected by the CDF II detector. A sample of 328 events with a charged electron or muon and an isolated track, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.9fb-1, are selected as tt̄ candidates. To account for the unconstrained event kinematics, we scan over the phase space of the azimuthal angles (ν1,ν2) of neutrinos and reconstruct the top quark mass for each ν1, ν2 pair by minimizing a χ2 function in the tt̄ dilepton hypothesis. We assign χ2-dependent weights to the solutions in order to build a preferred mass for each event. Preferred mass distributions (templates) are built from simulated tt̄ and background events, and parametrized in order to provide continuous probability density functions. A likelihood fit to the mass distribution in data as a weighted sum of signal and background probability density functions gives a top quark mass of 165.5-3.3+3.4(stat)±3. 1(syst)GeV/c2. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

Candidate events are selected requiring two or more jets and large missing transverse energy. At least two of the jets are required to be tagged as originating from a b quark to enhance the sensitivity. The results are in good agreement with the prediction of the standard model processes, giving no evidence for gluino decay to bottom squarks.

66749099043	Top quark mass measurement in the tt̄ all hadronic channel using a matrix element technique in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present a measurement of the top quark mass in the all hadronic channel (tt̄→bb̄q1q̄2q3q̄4) using 943pb-1 of pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV collected at the CDF II detector at Fermilab (CDF). We apply the standard model production and decay matrix element (ME) to tt̄ candidate events. We calculate per-event probability densities according to the ME calculation and construct template models of signal and background. The scale of the jet energy is calibrated using additional templates formed with the invariant mass of pairs of jets. These templates form an overall likelihood function that depends on the top quark mass and on the jet energy scale (JES). We estimate both by maximizing this function. Given 72 observed events, we measure a top quark mass of 171.1±3.7(stat+JES)±2.1(syst)GeV/c2. The combined uncertainty on the top quark mass is 4.3GeV/c2. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

67649878769	Search for WW and WZ production in lepton plus jets final state at CDF	We present a search for WW and WZ production in final states that contain a charged lepton (electron or muon) and at least two jets, produced in s=1.96TeV pp̄ collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron, using data corresponding to 1.2fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected with the CDF II detector. Diboson production in this decay channel has yet to be observed at hadron colliders due to the large single W plus jets background. An artificial neural network has been developed to increase signal sensitivity, as compared with an event selection based on conventional cuts. We set a 95% confidence level upper limit of σWW×BR(W→ν,W→jets)+σWZ×BR(W→ ν ,Z→jets)<2.88pb, which is consistent with the standard model next-to-leading-order cross section calculation for this decay channel of 2.09±0.12pb. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

67649882013	Measurement of the tt̄ cross section in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV using dilepton events with a lepton plus track selection	This paper reports a measurement of the cross section for the pair production of top quarks in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron. The data were collected from the CDF run II detector in a set of runs with a total integrated luminosity of 1.1fb-1. The cross section is measured in the dilepton channel, the subset of tt̄ events in which both top quarks decay through t→Wb→ νb, where =e, μ, or τ. The lepton pair is reconstructed as one identified electron or muon and one isolated track. The use of an isolated track to identify the second lepton increases the tt̄ acceptance, particularly for the case in which one W decays as W→τν. The purity of the sample may be further improved at the cost of a reduction in the number of signal events, by requiring an identified b jet. We present the results of measurements performed with and without the request of an identified b jet. The former is the first published CDF result for which a b-jet requirement is added to the dilepton selection. In the CDF data there are 129 pretag lepton+track candidate events, of which 69 are tagged. With the tagging information, the sample is divided into tagged and untagged subsamples, and a combined cross section is calculated by maximizing a likelihood. The result is σtt̄=9.6±1.2(stat)-0.5+0.6(sys)±0.6(lum)pb, assuming a branching ratio of BR(W→ ν)=10.8% and a top mass of mt=175GeV/c2. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

67649889993	Measurement of particle production and inclusive differential cross sections in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We report a set of measurements of particle production in inelastic pp̄ collisions collected with a minimum-bias trigger at the Tevatron Collider with the CDF II experiment. The inclusive charged particle transverse momentum differential cross section is measured, with improved precision, over a range about ten times wider than in previous measurements. The former modeling of the spectrum appears to be incompatible with the high particle momenta observed. The dependence of the charged particle transverse momentum on the event particle multiplicity is analyzed to study the various components of hadron interactions. This is one of the observable variables most poorly reproduced by the available Monte Carlo generators. A first measurement of the event transverse energy sum differential cross section is also reported. A comparison with a pythia prediction at the hadron level is performed. The inclusive charged-particle differential production cross section is fairly well reproduced only in the transverse momentum range available from previous measurements. At higher momentum the agreement is poor. The transverse energy sum is poorly reproduced over the whole spectrum. The dependence of the charged particle transverse momentum on the particle multiplicity needs the introduction of more sophisticated particle production mechanisms, such as multiple parton interactions, in order to be better explained. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The search used time of flight to isolate slowly moving, high-pT particles. One event passed our selection cuts with an expected background of 1.9±0.2 events.

We reconstruct a candidate tb̄ mass in events with a lepton, neutrino candidate, and two or three jets, and search for anomalous tb̄ production as modeled by W′→tb̄. We set a new limit on a right-handed W′ with standard model-like coupling, excluding any mass below 800GeV/c2 at 95% C.L. The cross section for any narrow, resonant tb̄ production between 750 and 950GeV/c2 is found to be less than 0.28pb at 95% C.L.

Jets corresponding to bottom quarks are identified with a secondary vertex tagging method, a jet probability tagging method, and a neural network filter. We use kinematic information in an artificial neural network to improve discrimination between signal and background compared to previous analyses. The observed number of events and the neural network output distributions are consistent with the standard model background expectations, and we set 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction ranging from 1.2 to 1.1Â pb or 7.5 to 102 times the standard model expectation for Higgs boson masses from 110 to 150 GeV/c2, respectively. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The search uses data produced in proton-antiproton collisions at s=1.96TeV corresponding to 1.9fb-1 of integrated luminosity taken with the CDF detector. We find 28 áγbET events versus an expectation of 31.0-3.5+4.1 events. If we further require events to contain at least three jets and large total transverse energy, the largest SM source is radiative top-quark pair production, tt̄+γ. In the data we observe 16 tt̄γ candidate events versus an expectation from SM sources of 11.2-2.1+2.3. Assuming the difference between the observed number and the predicted non-top-quark total of 6.8-2.0+2.2 is due to SM top-quark production, we estimate the tt̄γ cross section to be 0.15±0.08pb. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

70349762854	Search for the neutral current top quark decay t→Zc using the ratio of Z-boson+4jets to W-boson+4jets production	We have used the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF-II) to search for the flavor-changing neutral-current (FCNC) top-quark decay t→Zc using a technique employing ratios of W and Z production, measured in pp̄ data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.52fb-1. The analysis uses a comparison of two decay chains, pp̄→tt̄→WbWb→νbjjb and pp̄→tt̄→ZcWb→cjjb, to cancel systematic uncertainties in acceptance, efficiency, and luminosity. We validate the modeling of acceptance and efficiency for lepton identification over the multiyear data set using another ratio of W and Z production, in this case the observed ratio of inclusive production of W to Z bosons. To improve the discrimination against standard model backgrounds to top-quark decays, we calculate the top-quark mass for each event with two leptons and four jets assuming it is a tt̄ event with one of the top quarks decaying to Zc. For additional background discrimination we require at least one jet to be identified as originating from a b quark. No significant signal is found and we set an upper limit on the FCNC branching ratio Br(t→Zc) using a likelihood constructed from the cjjb top-quark mass distribution and the number of νbjjb events. Limits are set as a function of the helicity of the Z boson produced in the FCNC decay. For 100% longitudinally-polarized Z bosons we find limits of 8.3% and 9.3% (95% C.L.) depending on the assumptions regarding the theoretical top-quark pair production cross section. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The possible existence of two nearby mass states is investigated. Within the limits of our experimental resolution the data are consistent with a single state, and having no evidence for two states we set upper limits on the mass difference between two hypothetical states for different assumed ratios of contributions to the observed peak. For equal contributions, the 95% confidence level upper limit on the mass difference is 3.6MeV/c2.

78651305706	Search for the supersymmetric partner of the top quark in pp̄ collisions at √s=1.96TeV	We present a search for the lightest supersymmetric partner of the top quark in proton-antiproton collisions at a center-of-mass energy √s=1.96TeV. This search was conducted within the framework of the R parity conserving minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model, assuming the stop decays dominantly to a lepton, a sneutrino, and a bottom quark. We searched for events with two oppositely-charged leptons, at least one jet, and missing transverse energy in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1fb⊃-1 collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab experiment. No significant evidence of a stop quark signal was found. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level in the stop quark versus sneutrino mass plane are set. Stop quark masses up to 180GeV/c2 are excluded for sneutrino masses around 45GeV/c2, and sneutrino masses up to 116GeV/c2 are excluded for stop quark masses around 150GeV/c2. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

78651319000	Observation of single top quark production and measurement of |V 	We report the observation of electroweak single top quark production in 3.2fb⊃-1 of pp̄ collision data collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab at √s=1.96TeV. Candidate events in the W+jets topology with a leptonically decaying W boson are classified as signal-like by four parallel analyses based on likelihood functions, matrix elements, neural networks, and boosted decision trees. These results are combined using a super discriminant analysis based on genetically evolved neural networks in order to improve the sensitivity. This combined result is further combined with that of a search for a single top quark signal in an orthogonal sample of events with missing transverse energy plus jets and no charged lepton. We observe a signal consistent with the standard model prediction but inconsistent with the background-only model by 5.0 standard deviations, with a median expected sensitivity in excess of 5.9 standard deviations. We measure a production cross section of 2.3-0.5+0.6(stat+sys)pb, extract the value of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element |V

We also report on searches for W and Z production in double Pomeron exchange, p+p̄→p+[X+W/Z]+p̄, and on exclusive Z production, p̄+p→p̄+Z+p.

79960792989	Measurement of event shapes in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	A study of event-shape observables in proton-antiproton collisions at √s=1.96TeV is presented. The data for this analysis were recorded by the CDF II Detector at the Tevatron Collider. The variables studied are the transverse thrust and thrust minor, both defined in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction. The observables are measured using energies from unclustered calorimeter cells. In addition to studies of the differential distributions, we present the dependence of event-shape mean values on the leading-jet transverse energy. Data are compared with pythia Tune A and to resummed parton-level predictions that were matched to fixed-order results at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy (NLO+NLL). Predictions from pythia Tune A agree fairly well with the data. However, the underlying event contributes significantly to these observables, making it difficult to make direct comparisons to the NLO+NLL predictions, which do not account for the underlying event. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a new observable, a weighted difference of the mean values of the thrust and thrust minor, which is less sensitive to the underlying event, allowing for a comparison with NLO+NLL. Both pythia Tune A and the NLO+NLL calculations agree well within the 20% theoretical uncertainty with the data for this observable, indicating that perturbative QCD successfully describes shapes of the hadronic final states. © 2011 American Physical Society.

Pair production of supersymmetric gluinos and squarks with hadronic R-parity violating decays is employed as an example of a new physics benchmark for this signature. Selection criteria based on the kinematic properties of an ensemble of jet combinations within each event help to extract signal from copious QCD background. No significant excess outside the top quark mass window is observed in data with an integrated luminosity of 3.2fb⊃-1.

Based on this improved estimate, we show that the total number and the properties of the collected dimuon events are not yet accounted for by ordinary sources of dimuons which also include the contributions, as measured in the data, of heavy flavor, Υ{hooked}, and Drell-Yan production in addition to muons mimicked by hadronic punchthrough. The number of unaccounted events corresponds to (12.8±3.2)% of the bb̄ production. We find that (23±6)% of the unaccounted events contain additional muon candidates. For comparison, this fraction is (6.9±0.4)% for events due to bb̄ production. © 2011 The Author(s).

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.5fb-1 and was collected at s=8TeV by the CMS experiment. No significant excess is observed in the data above the expected background, and the existence of top-quark partners with masses below 800 GeV is excluded at a 95% confidence level, assuming they decay exclusively to tW.

Expressed in terms of the Fourier components of the azimuthal distribution, the n=3-6 harmonic coefficients are presented for charged particles as a function of their transverse momentum (0.3<pT<8.0GeV/c), collision centrality (0%-70%), and pseudorapidity (|η|<2.0). The data are analyzed using the event plane, multiparticle cumulant, and Lee-Yang zeros methods, which provide different sensitivities to initial-state fluctuations. Taken together with earlier LHC measurements of elliptic flow (n=2), the results on higher-order harmonic coefficients develop a more complete picture of the collective motion in high-energy heavy-ion collisions and shed light on the properties of the produced medium. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

Results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb<sup>−1</sup>recorded in proton-proton collisions at (Formula presented.) = 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC.

Upper limits on the production of generic WW, ZZ, or WZ resonances are set as a function of the resonance mass and width. We increase the sensitivity of the analysis by statistically combining the results of this search with a complementary study of the all-hadronic final state. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the bulk graviton production cross section in the range from 700 to 10 fb for resonance masses between 600 and 2500 GeV, respectively.

Jet spectra are reported in the transverse momentum (pT) range of 80-250GeV/c, and within pseudorapidity |η|<2. The nuclear modification factor (RAA) calculated from these spectra shows a strong suppression in the b-jet yield in PbPb collisions relative to the yield observed in pp collisions at the same energy. The suppression persists to the largest values of pT studied, and is centrality dependent. The RAA is about 0.4 in the most central events, similar to previous observations for inclusive jets. This implies that jet quenching does not have a strong dependence on parton mass and flavor in the jet pT range studied.

Two analyses are considered: an inclusive search for new heavy particle pairs decaying to final states with at least two jets and missing transverse energy, and a dedicated search for final states with at least one jet originating from a bottom quark. For both the inclusive study and the study requiring a bottom-quark jet, the data are examined in exclusive final states corresponding to all-hadronic, single-lepton, and dilepton events. The study is based on the data set of proton-proton collisions at s=7TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2011, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7fb-1. The study consists of a shape analysis performed in the plane of two kinematic variables, denoted MR and R2, that correspond to the mass and transverse energy flow, respectively, of pair-produced, heavy, new-physics particles. The data are found to be compatible with the background model, defined by studying event simulations and data control samples. Exclusion limits for squark and gluino production are derived in the context of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM) and also for simplified-model spectra (SMS). Within the CMSSM parameter space considered, squark and gluino masses up to 1350 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, depending on the model parameters. For SMS scenarios, the direct production of pairs of top or bottom squarks is excluded for masses as high as 400 GeV.

V. Khachatryan et al.	Searches are presented for heavy scalar (H) and pseudoscalar (A) Higgs bosons posited in the two doublet model (2HDM) extensions of the standard model (SM). These searches are based on a data sample of pp collisions collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of s=8TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5fb-1. The decays H→hh and A→Zh, where h denotes an SM-like Higgs boson, lead to events with three or more isolated charged leptons or with a photon pair accompanied by one or more isolated leptons. The search results are presented in terms of the H and A production cross sections times branching fractions and are further interpreted in terms of 2HDM parameters. We place 95% C.L. cross section upper limits of approximately 7 pb on σB for H→hh and 2 pb for A→Zh. Also presented are the results of a search for the rare decay of the top quark that results in a charm quark and an SM Higgs boson, t→ch, the existence of which would indicate a nonzero flavor-changing Yukawa coupling of the top quark to the Higgs boson. We place a 95% C.L. upper limit of 0.56% on B(t→ch).

84919926013	Measurement of pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles in proton–proton collisions at (Equation Present) TeV by the CMS and TOTEM experiments	Pseudorapidity (Equation Present) distributions of charged particles produced in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8(Equation Present) are measured in the ranges (Equation Present) and (Equation Present) covered by the CMS and TOTEM detectors, respectively. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of (Equation Present). Measurements are presented for three event categories. The most inclusive category is sensitive to 91–96 % of the total inelastic proton–proton cross section. The other two categories are disjoint subsets of the inclusive sample that are either enhanced or depleted in single diffractive dissociation events. The data are compared to models used to describe high-energy hadronic interactions. None of the models considered provide a consistent description of the measured distributions.

84922833302	Measurement of jet fragmentation in PbPb and pp collisions at s NN =2.76 TeV	The jet fragmentation function of inclusive jets with transverse momentum pT above 100GeV/c in PbPb collisions has been measured using reconstructed charged particles with pT above 1GeV/c in a cone of radius 0.3 around the jet axis. A data sample of PbPb collisions collected in 2011 at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of sNN=2.76TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 150μb-1 is used. The results for PbPb collisions as a function of collision centrality and jet transverse momentum are compared to reference distributions based on pp data collected at the same center-of-mass energy in 2013, with an integrated luminosity of 5.3pb-1. A centrality-dependent modification of the fragmentation function is found. For the most central collisions, a significant enhancement is observed in the PbPb/pp fragmentation function ratio for charged particles with pT less than 3GeV/c. This enhancement is observed for all jet pT bins studied. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

84922834050	Search for anomalous production of events with three or more leptons in pp collisions at s =8TeV	A search for physics beyond the standard model in events with at least three leptons is presented. The data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5fb-1 of proton-proton collisions with center-of-mass energy s=8TeV, was collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC during 2012. The data are divided into exclusive categories based on the number of leptons and their flavor, the presence or absence of an opposite-sign, same-flavor lepton pair (OSSF), the invariant mass of the OSSF pair, the presence or absence of a tagged bottom-quark jet, the number of identified hadronically decaying τ leptons, and the magnitude of the missing transverse energy and of the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta. The numbers of observed events are found to be consistent with the expected numbers from standard model processes, and limits are placed on new-physics scenarios that yield multilepton final states. In particular, scenarios that predict Higgs boson production in the context of supersymmetric decay chains are examined. We also place a 95% confidence level upper limit of 1.3% on the branching fraction for the decay of a top quark to a charm quark and a Higgs boson (t→cH), which translates to a bound on the left- and right-handed top-charm flavor-violating Higgs Yukawa couplings, λtcH and λctH, respectively, of |λtcH|2+|λctH|2<0.21. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

84922834125	Search for jet extinction in the inclusive jet-pT spectrum from proton-proton collisions at s=8TeV	The first search at the LHC for the extinction of QCD jet production is presented, using data collected with the CMS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 10.7fb-1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The extinction model studied in this analysis is motivated by the search for signatures of strong gravity at the TeV scale (terascale gravity) and assumes the existence of string couplings in the strong-coupling limit. In this limit, the string model predicts the suppression of all high-transverse-momentum standard model processes, including jet production, beyond a certain energy scale. To test this prediction, the measured transverse-momentum spectrum is compared to the theoretical prediction of the standard model. No significant deficit of events is found at high transverse momentum. A 95% confidence level lower limit of 3.3 TeV is set on the extinction mass scale. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

84922834193	Measurement of the muon charge asymmetry in inclusive pp →w+X production at s =7TeV and an improved determination of light parton distribution functions	Measurements of the muon charge asymmetry in inclusive pp→W+X production at s=7TeV are presented. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.7fb-1 recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. With a sample of more than 20 million W→μν events, the statistical precision is greatly improved in comparison to previous measurements. These new results provide additional constraints on the parton distribution functions of the proton in the range of the Bjorken scaling variable x from 10-3 to 10-1. These measurements and the recent CMS measurement of associated W+charm production are used together with the cross sections for inclusive deep inelastic e±p scattering at HERA in a next-to-leading-order QCD analysis. The determination of the valence quark distributions is improved, and the strange-quark distribution is probed directly through the leading-order process g+s→W+c in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

84922959119	Determination of the top-quark pole mass and strong coupling constant from the tt̄ production cross section in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV	The inclusive cross section for top-quark pair production measured by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is compared to the QCD prediction at next-to-next-to-leading order with various parton distribution functions to determine the top-quark pole mass, m<inf>t</inf> <sup>pole</sup>, or the strong coupling constant, α<inf>S</inf>. With the parton distribution function set NNPDF2.3, a pole mass of 176. 7<sup>+3.8</sup> <inf>-3.4</inf>GeV is obtained when constraining α<inf>S</inf>at the scale of the Z boson mass, m<inf>Z</inf>, to the current world average. Alternatively, by constraining m<inf>t</inf> <sup>pole</sup>to the latest average from direct mass measurements, a value of α<inf>S</inf>(m<inf>Z</inf>) = 0. 1151<sup>+0.0033</sup> <inf>-0.0032</inf>is extracted. This is the first determination of α<inf>S</inf>using events from top-quark production. © 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

84924025032	Search for WWγ and WZγ production and constraints on anomalous quartic gauge couplings in pp collisions at s =8TeV	A search for WVγ triple vector boson production is presented based on events containing a W boson decaying to a muon or an electron and a neutrino, a second V (W or Z) boson, and a photon. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.3fb-1 collected in 2012 with the CMS detector at the LHC in pp collisions at s=8TeV. An upper limit of 311 fb on the cross section for the WVγ production process is obtained at 95% confidence level for photons with a transverse energy above 30 GeV and with an absolute value of pseudorapidity of less than 1.44. This limit is approximately a factor of 3.4 larger than the standard model predictions that are based on next-to-leading order QCD calculations. Since no evidence of anomalous WWγγ or WWZγ quartic gauge boson couplings is found, this paper presents the first experimental limits on the dimension-eight parameter fT,0 and the CP-conserving WWZγ parameters κ0W and κCW. Limits are also obtained for the WWγγ parameters a0W and aCW. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

84924620013	Searches for electroweak neutralino and chargino production in channels with Higgs, Z, and W bosons in pp collisions at 8 TeV	Searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) are presented based on the electroweak pair production of neutralinos and charginos, leading to decay channels with Higgs, Z, and W bosons and undetected lightest SUSY particles (LSPs). The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about 19.5fb-1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected in 2012 with the CMS detector at the LHC. The main emphasis is neutralino pair production in which each neutralino decays either to a Higgs boson (h) and an LSP or to a Z boson and an LSP, leading to hh, hZ, and ZZ states with missing transverse energy (ETmiss). A second aspect is chargino-neutralino pair production, leading to hW states with ETmiss. The decays of a Higgs boson to a bottom-quark pair, to a photon pair, and to final states with leptons are considered in conjunction with hadronic and leptonic decay modes of the Z and W bosons. No evidence is found for supersymmetric particles, and 95% confidence level upper limits are evaluated for the respective pair production cross sections and for neutralino and chargino mass values.

84925595714	Evidence for the 125 gev higgs boson decaying to a pair of τ leptons	A search for a standard model Higgs boson decaying into a pair of τ leptons is performed using events recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 and 2012. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb<sup>-1</sup> at a centre-of-mass energy of 7TeV and 19.7fb<sup>-1</sup> at 8TeV. Each τ lepton decays hadronically or leptonically to an electron or a muon, leading to six different final states for the τ-lepton pair, all considered in this analysis. An excess of events is observed over the expected background contributions, with a local significance larger than 3 standard deviations for mH values between 115 and 130 GeV. The best fit of the observed H → ττ signal cross section times branching fraction for m<inf>H</inf> = 125 GeV is 0.78±0.27 times the standard model expectation. These observations constitute evidence for the 125 GeV Higgs boson decaying to a pair of τ leptons.
