1842451857	Anaerobic hydrogen production from sucrose using an acid-enriched sewage sludge microflora	A novel and high-rate anaerobic sequencing bath reactor (ASBR) process was used to evaluate the hydrogen productivity of an acid-enriched sewage sludge microflora at a temperature of 35°C. In this ASBR process a 4 h cycle, including feed, reaction, settle, and decant steps, was repeatedly performed in a 5 L reactor. The sucrose substrate concentration was 20 g COD/L; the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was maintained at 12-120 h at the initial period and thereafter at 4-12 h. The reaction/settle period ratio, which is the most important parameter for ASBR operation was 1.7. The experimental results indicated that the hydrogenic activity of the sludge microflora was HRT-dependent and that proper pH control was necessary for a stable operation of the bioreactor. The peak hydrogenic activity value was attained at an HRT of 8 h and an organic loading rate of 80 kg COD/ m

0030615577	Production and inhibitant-affected utilization of butyric acid in anaerobic digestion process	The fates of both forms of butyric acid (HBu) in anaerobic digesters were discussed. Hbu production was investigated by using glucose as the substrate in continuous feeding digestion at 35°C at pH 5.7, 6.4 and 6.9 and at the SRT(s) (solid retention times) of 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.25 days. Production of n-HBu increased with increasing SRT. No production of i-HBu was determined at SRT >2.0 days when the pH was low. Inhibitant effect on the utilization of HBu were investigated by batch test at 35°C. The CSTR seed sludge digesters were continuously fed with n-HBu or i-HBu, and the SRT were 20,14,10,6,5 and 20,14,10,8,7,6 days, respectively. In the batch test, the acclimated sludge (SRT 10 days) was used. Isomerization between n-HBu and i-HBu was evident from the experimental results but the isomerization of i-HBu was readily affected by oleate, sulfate or ammonia. The relative toxicities were oleate >> sulfate > ammonia for the utilization of both forms of HBu.

It is known that the activity of acidogenic granular sludge is affected by the sulfur compounds.

0031215014	Effect of heavy metals on the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket process	This study examined the effects of ionic chromium, cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, and nickel on methane production and volatile fatty acid (VFA) production in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor using serum bottle assays. The granular seed sludges were acclimated with glucose by continuous feeding. According to experimental results, effects of the metals relied on the sludge zones, VFA types and metal types. The metal concentrations that caused 50% inhibition of methane production and total VFA production ranged from 210-2640 mg/L and 350~>>5000 mg/L, respectively. The metals' relative toxicity to total VFA degradation was in the order of Cu>>Cr>Cd⇆>>Zn>Ni>Pb and Cu>>CdΓr>>Ni>Zn>Pb for bed and blanket sludges, respectively. Our results also confirmed copper and lead to be the most toxic and least toxic metals tested, respectively. In UASB biogranules, the organisms responsible for methane production were less resistant to metal toxicity than those responsible for VFA production.

0033080628	Effect of heavy metals on the methanogenic UASB granule	The effects of ionic chromium, cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, and nickel on the methanogenic UASB granule were examined by using serum bottle assays. Granular seed sludge was acclimated with a mixture of acetic (HAc), propionic (HPr) and burytic (HBu) acids. According to those results, the metal effects relied on the kinds of metal, zones of sludge, types of volatile fatty acid (VFA) and hydraulic retention time (HRT). The relative toxicity of the metals to total VFA degradation was Cu>Cr>Cd = (with falling dots) Zn>Ni≫Pb for both bed and blanket sludges; however, different degrees of toxicity were observed for individual VFAs and sludges. For the degradation of total VFA, the copper toxicity resistance of blanket sludge was lower than that of the bed sludge. The biogranules' VFA degradation activity reduced by 50% for the biomass that came into contact with 26-3200 mg/L of the tested metals. Compared with an UASB acidogenesis process, the biogranules in the methanogenesis process exhibited a higher sensitivity to metal toxicity than the biogranules in the acidogenesis process. However, in the biogranules of methanogenesis process the HPr- and HBu-degrading acidogens were more sensitive in activity to copper than HAc-degrading methanogens. Besides, long HRT increased the toxicity resistance of HAc-degrading methanogens but decreased that of HPr- and HBu-degrading acidogens.

0032820333	Characteristics of metallic toxicity-resistance between bed and blanket sludges in UASB systems	This study was undertaken to compare the toxicity-resistance of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) systems' bed and blanket sludges to heavy metals (cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, lead and zinc). Experiments were conducted by serum vial assays. The results indicate that total volatile fatty acids (VFA) production and degradation activities decreased with an increasing metal concentration for both sludges. The metallic toxicity- resistance of UASB biogranules was related to zones of sludge, kinds of heavy metal, types of individual VFA, and phases and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of an UASB system. Acidogenic and conventional bed sludges were more resistant to the above noted heavy metals than blanket sludges. For VFA degradation, the toxicity-resistance of both bed and blanket sludges at HRT 2 days was higher than those at HRT 1 day.

38849120692	Heavy metal effects on fermentative hydrogen production using natural mixed microflora	The effects of ionic Cr, Cu and Zn on fermentative hydrogen production were examined using serum vial assays. The hydrogen-producing natural mixed microflora (dominated by the Clostridium species) was cultivated from sewage sludge with sucrose. The relative heavy metal toxicity to fermentative hydrogen production was Zn > Cu > Cr. The microflora hydrogen production activity was reduced by 50% for a biomass that came into contact with 4.5 mg Zn/L, 6.5 mg Cu/L and 60 mg Cr/L. However, low concentrations of 3 mg Cu/L and 15 mg Cr/L resulted in peak 10-20% in hydrogen production stimulation. The threshold concentrations were 4 mg Cu/L and 25 mg Cr/L, over which declining stimulation occurred. Heavy metals affected the hydrogen fermentation in hydrogen production potential, hydrogen production rate, lag-phase time and soluble microbial products; their influences were dependent on metal kind and concentration. Metabolic pathway shift occurred when the metal concentrations varied. Based on the maximum specific hydrogen production rate, the inhibition patterns of Cu and Zn dosages were kinetically competitive with inhibition coefficients of 2.9 and 4.5 mg/L, respectively. The metal-toxicity to the hydrogenesis, acidogenesis and methanogenesis in anaerobic digestion was compared. Strategies based on heavy metal concentration control in the substrate influent for optimal hydrogen production were proposed. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

40849133972	Optimizing circuit parameters of the biohydrogen real-time power generating system by genetic algorithm	This study performs optimal estimation of circuit parameters for a biohydrogen real-time power generating system by using a penalty-function genetic algorithm (GA). Circuit parameters of this system change with operating temperature and current density; some circuit parameters are nonlinear. To elucidate the circuit characteristics of the whole system, this study uses penalty-function GA to optimally estimate circuit parameters using data from a V - I characteristic experiment on novel biohydrogen real-time power generating system. This study then solves the circuit characteristic by the estimated circuit parameters formulated utilizing Kirchhoff's law. Then, the estimated V - I characteristic is then compared with actual measurements to verify the feasibility of this novel approach. In the same manner, the capacitor parameter of the biohydrogen real-time power generating system can be estimated to identify the alternating current (AC) equivalent circuit for this system. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

40749132882	Molecular monitoring of microbes in a continuous hydrogen-producing system with different hydraulic retention time	An anaerobic continuous-flow fermentation system with condensed molasses fermentation soluble (CMS) from monosodium glutamate production as substrate was developed for the biohydrogen production. The production rate of the system was increased, while hydraulic retention time (HRT) was varied from 12 to 3 h and the optimal hydrogen production rate was obtained at HRT 3 h. The major bacterial composition of each HRT was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene-targeted denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Acidaminococcus sp. that could evolve hydrogen from glutamate was the only hydrogen producer and could be also detected from substrate. Hydrogenase mRNA-targeted reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that except HRT 3 h, two clusters of clostridial hydrogenase gene sequences were obtained. RT-PCR-DGGE analysis was employed to illustrate the active clostridial strains confirming that clostridial strains were not present at HRT 3 h. Acidaminococcus sp. existing in substrate might be the major strain that contributes to hydrogen production at HRT 3 h. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

However, unsatisfied results were often obtained due to the difficulty of distinguishing coexisting Clostridium and other anaerobic microorganisms. In this study, a specific PCR primer set (Chis150f-ClostIr), based on the available rRNA gene sequences from the database, targeting only the majority of Clusters I and II Clostridia was designed and tested on both the pure culture Clostridium and dark fermentation sludge. It was demonstrated that this new primer set could not only successfully distinguish the coexisted Clostridium species but also revealed the existence of some Clostridium species in the sludge which could not be detected by using the universal primer set. This method successfully provides a detailed view on the Clostridium community responsible for an effective hydrogen production in dark fermentation system. © 2007.

Based on uses of the differential evolution algorithm method, optimal estimation of the circuit parameters is achieved by data from a V-I characteristic experiment on the proposed biohydrogen real time power generating system.

84867402018	Optimizing biohydrogen production from mushroom cultivation waste using anaerobic mixed cultures	The mushroom bag is a polypropylene bag stuffed with wood flour and bacterial nutrients. After being used for growing mushroom for one to two weeks this bag becomes mushroom cultivation waste (MCW). About 150 million bags (80,000 tons) of MCW are produced annually in Taiwan and are usually burned or discarded. The cellulosic materials and nutrients in MCW could be used as the feedstock and nutrients for anaerobic biohydrogen fermentation. This study aims to select the inoculum from various waste sludges (sewage sludge I, sewage sludge II, cow dung and pig slurry) with or without adding any extra nutrients. A batch test was operated at a MCW concentration of 20 g COD/L, temperature 55 °C and an initial cultivation pH of 8. The results show that extra nutrient addition inhibited hydrogen production rate (HPR) and hydrogen production yield (HY) when using cow dung and pig slurry seeds. However, nutrient addition enhanced the HPR and HY in case of using sewage sludge inoculum and without inoculum. This related to the inhibition caused by high nutrient concentration (such as nitrogen) in cow dung and pig slurry. Peak HY of 0.73 mmol H

The optimal initial cultivation pH (tested range 5-7) and substrate concentration (tested range 5-60-gCOD/L) were evaluated by batch reactors while the effects of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on hydrogen production, as expressed by hydrogen yield (HY) and hydrogen production rate (HPR), were evaluated by continuous tests.

48949115612	Enhancement of fermentative hydrogen/ethanol production from cellulose using mixed anaerobic cultures	Batch tests were conducted to evaluate the enhancement of hydrogen/ethanol (EtOH) productivity using cow dung microflora to ferment α-cellulose and saccharification products (glucose and xylose). Hydrogen/ethanol production was evaluated based on hydrogen/ethanol yields (HY/EY) under 55 °C at various initial pH conditions (5.5-9.0). Our test results indicate that cow dung sludge is a good mixed natural-microflora seed source for producing biohydrogen/ethanol from cellulose and xylose. The heat-pretreatment, commonly used to produce hydrogen more efficiently from hexose, applied to mixed anaerobic cultures did not help cow dung culture convert cellulose and xylose into hydrogen/ethanol. Instead of heat-pretreatment, the mixed culture received enrichments cultivated at 55 °C for 4 days. Positive results were observed: hydrogen/ethanol production from fermenting cellulose and xylose was effectively enhanced at increases of 4.8 (ethanol) to 8 (hydrogen) and 2.4 (ethanol) to 15.6 (hydrogen) folds, respectively. In which, the ethanol concentration produced from xylose reached 4-4.4 g/L, an output comparable to that of using heat-treated sewage sludge and better than that (1.25-3 g/L) using pure cultures. Our test results show that for the enriched cultures the initial cultivation pH can affect hydrogen/ethanol production including HY, EY and liquid fermentation product concentration and distribution. These results were also concurred using a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis saying that both cultivation pH and substrate can affect the enriched cow dung culture microbial communities. The enriched cow dung culture had an optimal initial cultivation pH range of 7.6-8.0 with peak HY/EY values of 2.8 mmol-H

52049088717	The application of Fuzzy controller for fuel cell generating studies	The number of energy-consuming products is increasing. The use of renewable energy has already become the global goal to solve the global energy shortage. The development of the fuel cell is an important subject. This study plots the V-I characteristic curve of fuel cells using LabView. The experimental result demonstrates that the efficiency with which a fuel cell generates electricity when controlled by a Fuzzy controller is 37% - which significantly exceeds that obtained using a PID controller, 14.67%. Hence, much less bio-hydrogen is wasted, so the cost of generating electricity using the fuel cell is lower. Moreover, the Fuzzy controller need not be used for a long time as a PID controller to estimate and test variables. This research will contribute to the development of the bio-hydrogen fuel cell generators. Crown Copyright © 2008.

52049100588	Microbial community structure of a starch-feeding fermentative hydrogen production reactor operated under different incubation conditions	The aim of this study was to establish the particular biohydrogen-production related microbial community structure in a starch-feeding dark fermentation agitated granular sludge bed (AGSB) reactor which was operated under pH 6.0 and 5.5 as well as under different hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The bacterial community diversity and percent of their cell count of the bioreactor were ascertained using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) individually. Based on the comparison of bacterial structure and hydrogen production efficiency under different HRT, no conclusion could be made on whether the diversity of Clostridium community could directly affect the reactor performance in these two pH systems. However, bacterial cell counts showed that the viable number of dominated Clostridium sp. changed along with the hydrogen production rate (HPR). It was believed that it could directly affect the hydrogen production efficiency. The highest HPR and hydrogen yield (HY) occurred when the reactor was operated at HRT 0.5 h, while the ratio of Clostridium sp. cell count and Bifidobacterium sp. cell count over the total Eubacteria cell count were around 40% and 40-60%, respectively. Therefore, we suggested that bacterial species which could degrade starch, such as Bifidobacterium sp. in this study, broke down starch into small molecules first and then these less complex compounds were utilized by the Clostridium species for hydrogen production. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

67651230907	Quantitative fluorescent in-situ hybridization: A hypothesized competition mode between two dominant bacteria groups in hydrogen-producing anaerobic sludge processes	Two hydrogen-producing continuous flow stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) fed respectively with glucose and sucrose were investigated by polymerase chain reaction-denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH). The substrate was fed in a continuous mode decreased from hydraulic retention time (HRT) 10 hours to 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 hours. Quantitative fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) observations further demonstrated that two morphotypes of bacteria dominated both microbial communities. One was long rod bacteria which can be targeted either by Chis150 probe designed to hybridize the gram positive low G+C bacteria or the specific oligonucleotide probe Lg10-6. The probe Lg10-6, affiliated with Clostridium pasteurianum, was designed and then checked with other reference organisms. The other type, unknown group, which cannot be detected by Chis150 was curved rod bacteria. Notably, the population ratios of the two predominant groups reflected the different operational performance of the two reactors, such as hydrogen producing rates, substrate turnover rates and metabolites compositions. Therefore, a competition mode of the two dominant bacteria groups was hypothesized. In the study, 16S rRNA-based gene library of hydrogen-producing microbial communities was established. The efficiency of hydrogen yields was correlated with substrates (glucose or sucrose), HRT, metabolites compositions (acetate, propionate, butyrate and ethanol), thermal pre-treatment (seed biomass was heated at 100°C for 45 minutes), and microbial communities in the bioreactor, not sludge sources (municipal sewage sludge, alcohol-processing sludge, or bean-processing sludge). The designed specific oligonucleotide probe Lg10-6 also provides us a useful and fast molecular tool to screen hydrogen-producing microbial communities in the future research. © IWA Publishing 2009.

Serum bottles were used for seed micro-flora cultivation and batch hydrogen fermentation tests (CMS substrate concentrations of 10-160 g-COD/L). Three hydrogen-producing bacterial strains Clostridium sporosphaeroides F52, Clostridium tyrobutyricum F4 and Clostridium pasteurianum F40 were isolated from the seed fermentor and used as the seeding microbes in single and mixed-culture cultivations for determining their hydrogen productivity. These strains possessed specific hydrogenase genes that could be detected from CMS-fed hydrogen fermentors and were major hydrogen producers. C. pasteurianum F40 was the dominant strain with a high hydrogen production rate while C. sporosphaeroides F52 may play a main role in degrading carbohydrate and glutamate. These strains could be co-cultivated as a symbiotic mixed-culture process to enhance hydrogen productivity. C. pasteurianum F40 or C. tyrobutyricum F4 co-culture with the glutamate-utilizing strain C. sporosphaeroides F52 efficiently enhanced hydrogen production by 12-220% depending on the substrate CMS concentrations. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

In this study, bacteria in a sucrose-feeding hydrogen-producing bioreactor were investigated via 16S rDNA-based analysis. Results showed that Clostridium pasteurianum, Klebsiella sp., and Streptococcus sp. were the predominant microorganisms. The Streptococcus sp. cells were found to localize inside hydrogen-producing granular sludge and were surrounded by clostridia. Significant oxygen consumption was found in the Klebsiella sp. pure culture experiment, in which oxidation reduction potential (ORP) dropped from 100 to -500 mV during the log phase within 2 h. Oxygen consumption by Streptococcus sp. was not significant, and it accumulated EPS under anaerobic conditions. Results suggest that Klebsiella sp. first utilized the oxygen to form anaerobic conditions in this system. Streptococcus sp., on the other hand, produced EPS complexes to strengthen the sludge granule followed by the mass growth of Clostridium sp. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

0036161275	Acid-base enrichment enhances anaerobic hydrogen production process	This study offers a novel and quick enrichment technology that can be used as a preliminary method to obtain a hydrogen-producing species from the biological sludge produced by wastewater treatment. The influences of acid-base enrichment (by sludge pH adjustment) on the anaerobic hydrogen-producing micro-organisms were investigated using serum bottle assays. The enrichment pH values were controlled at 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11 and 12 with 1 N hydrochloric acid and 1 N sodium hydroxide. For each enrichment pH, the cultivation pH values were controlled at 5, 6 and 7. Based on the experimental results, hydrogen accumulation from sludge with acid or base enrichment is higher than that of the control. The hydrogen-production potential of the sludge with acid or base enrichment is 200 and 333 times enhanced, compared with the control, when the enrichment pH is 10 and 3, respectively. The enhancement is due to a shortening of the micro-organisms' lag-time which occurs at a proper cultivation-pH level.

Heat-treatment is a well known method to inhibit hydrogen-consuming bacteria in using anaerobic mixed cultures for seeding. This study aims to investigate the effects of heat-treatment temperature and time on activated sludge for fermentative hydrogen production from a-cellulose by response surface methodology. Hydrogen and methane production was evaluated based on the production rate and yield (the ability of converting cellulose into hydrogen and methane) with heat-treated sludge as the seed at various temperatures (60-97°C) and times (20-60 min).

79958164913	Fuzzy control of a bio-hydrogen internal combustion engine generating system	This study proposes a fuzzy control bio-hydrogen internal combustion engine (ICE) generating system. The ICE technology is composed of thermodynamics, mechanical engineering, hydrodynamics, and electrical engineering. Bio-hydrogen can provide clean and efficient power instead of conventional fuels applied in an ICE. The two critical cores of hydrogen ICE generator are ignition time control which can precisely ignite air-fuel mixtures to make generator output stable power and air-fuel ratio control which can adjust output power to satisfy load demand. Fuzzy logic can provide precise control and response fast within various air-fuel ratios. The study establishes a fuzzy control system with an output generator and an ICE with solenoid valve that controls bio-hydrogen injection. The experimental system successfully output stable power and carried out parameters of bio-hydrogen flow rate, air-fuel ratio, injection pressure, and ignition timing. Parameters and experimental data are analyzed in the study and can be references for future development of the bio-hydrogen internal combustion engine generating system. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

L. Power spectrum diagrams of bed pressure fluctuation were used with hydraulic retention times (HRT) and geometric factors to identify the flow regimes in the bioreactors, where HRT varied from 8 to 1. h. It was found that the flow regimes in the bioreactors changed from a dispersed regime to coalesced and slugging regimes, when the biogas production rate (BPR) increased, as a result of decreasing the operating HRT. The flow regime was a dispersed bubble regime when the HRT was higher than 4. h in the bioreactor, whereas when the HRT was 2. h the coalesced bubble phenomena occurred in the bioreactor. A slugging regime was found when the HRT was lower than 1. h in thinner bioreactor. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

83055173106	Quantitative analysis of microorganism composition in a pilot-scale fermentative biohydrogen production system	Five specific real-time polymerase chain reaction primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene of Clostridium spp., Klebsiella spp., Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Bifidobacterium spp., and two primer sets targeting the hydrogenase genes of hydrogen-producing Clostridium pasteurianum and Clostridium butyricum were designed and tested in the present study to quantify the microorganisms in fermentative biohydrogen production systems. The former primers revealed the composition of all coexisting microorganisms, whereas the latter ones provided information on which clostridia were responsible for the biohydrogen production in various operational conditions. When sucrose was selected as the feeding substrate, the biogas production and hydrogen production rate (HPR) of the system increased as the percentage of Clostridium spp. (especially C. pasteurianum) increased. The cell count of C. pasteurianum increased up to 90% of the total cell population when the system approached its maximum hydrogen production. C. butyricum was identified as the main hydrogen-producing clostridium in the condensed molasses soluble wastewater feeding system, but there was no significant correlation between system HPR and C. butyricum cell count. At the same time, other microorganisms, such as Bifidobacterium spp. and Klebsiella spp., were the predominant ones throughout the whole operation and possibly caused the unsatisfied biohydrogen production. The composition of microorganisms is the principal factor affecting biohydrogen production. Aside from the well-known hydrogen-producing Clostridium spp., several other microorganisms not only coexist but can also significantly affect system performance. The monitoring method established in the present study provides a fast quantification procedure to help operators understand how the system works and therefore quickly respond in operations. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

83055179791	Constructing a new business model for fermentative hydrogen production from wastewater treatment	The development of hydrogen energy as a sustainable energy resource is essential for mitigating climate change. The primary challenge to the commercialization of hydrogen energy, relative to that of petrochemical fuels, is cost. Therefore, an innovative business model that converts the costs of procuring biomass into revenue via the production of hydrogen was developed. Profitable hydrogen production can typically be realized by lowering costs through continuous technological development and increasing scale. Feedstock procurement costs, however, limit the cost/benefit reduction flexibility. This study employs biowaste material as feedstock for biological fermentative hydrogen production. This model extends the hydrogen production value chain to include the income from biomass hydrogen production as well as the revenue from processing biowaste and reduced fuel source costs. This study investigates the costs involved in the commercialization of the hydrogen fermentation process, develops an innovative business model, and presents a case study to describe this model. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

One is a suspended sludge bioreactor (SSB) which used suspended seed sludge. The other bioreactor is an immobilized cell bioreactor (ICB) which used immobilized cells and mix the same seed sludge in the SSB as the source of the bacteria. It was found that the hydrogen production rate increased with a decrease in the hydraulic retention time (HRT), when substrate concentration was 40 g COD/L in an SSB as well as maximum hydrogen production rate of 14.04 ± 2.08 L/d/L obtained at HRT 0.5 h (ca. 5.78 times value of HRT 4 h) in the SSB system. The hydrogen production rate at low dilution rate (HRT > 4 h), in the ICB is better than SSB, meanwhile at a high dilution rate (HRT < 4 h), due to the presence of enriched granules in the SSB (12.30 g VSS/L), absent in the ICB (9.89 g VSS/L), the hydrogen production rate was 7.60 ± 1.05 L/d/L (ca. 1.23 times higher than HRT 4 h), which was lower than the rate in the SSB. Eventually, the hydrogen production rate increased by increasing the substrate concentrations from 40 to 60 g COD/L within the HRT range of 2-4 h in both the SSB as well as in ICB systems. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The present work made a patent analysis of advanced hydrogen production techniques comparing it with similar prior art in China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the European Union and the United States (U.S.) The aims were to find the scope, competitiveness of prior art, as well as the technology trend on biohydrogen production methods. The patents value was assessed its geographic scope and competitiveness indicators such as green image, low cost, energy efficiency and equipment design. It was found that most of the hydrogen production methods and associated technologies are developed by academic institutions, however their patents are reduced to a local level, and few are patented at international level, which reduces their competitiveness. The China (P.R.C.) is the biggest patent contributor worldwide in terms of hydrogen production methods by academic institutions. Japan is a huge patent contributor, in terms of methods aiming rear-end products application of hydrogen by private companies. The biggest amount of prior art found that the most popular methods of pre-treatment and dark fermentation produced coincide with the time of energetic crisis and the green movement to find alternative fuels. Finally, patent analysis of this study can help to discern the current technology trend and to develop the next generation of biohydrogen processes and associated technologies. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

83055188427	Market and patent analysis of commercializing biohydrogen technology	In the face of world-wide energy price fluctuation, energy supply security, and the energy crisis, it becomes an urgent issue to search for alternative methods for energy generation and to close the gap between the supply and demand of global energy. The current method of energy supply in Taiwan is through a centralized electronic power system, which is generated by a few large electronic power plants. Hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) has a characteristic of de-centralized electronic power supply system, which provides electronic power more reliably, efficiently and economically. Based on the output of Taiwan's sewage, sludge, kitchen waste and biohydrogen technology, the preliminary market for biohydrogen fuel cell (BHFC) is positioning itself toward the supply of public electronic power within the housing communities. Based on the patent analysis of BHFC, this study finds that Taiwan pays more attention to the front-end manufacturing of raw materials and emphasizes the development of biohydrogen technology, while America and Japan mainly pay more attentions to rear-end product application and emphasize the application of hydrogen and fuel cells by integrating industrial opinions. Based on the market analysis of BHFC, this study finds that the product attributes, consumers' characteristics and external variables strongly influence consumer's purchase intention of biohydrogen technology products. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

84863336519	The causal relationship analysis on the green building system assessment dimensions	Urbanization has clearly become the core of development in major global cities' economics, politics, society, culture, and education. In the foreseeable future, the strategies of high density, high-rise residential building will force the farmland, grassland and forests to be replaced by streets, driveways, buildings, and other nonpermeable pavement. Restated, the above strategies will worsen the urban heat island effect and air pollution. Meanwhile, resource consumption increases as the world's population continues to surge, hence, any concept that can maximize the benefits of utilization and reduce waste is encouraged. Therefore, green-oriented building design has become an urgent issue. There are four dimensions to Green Building environmental assessment including: ecology, energy saving, waste reduction, and health. This study aims to analyze the causal relationships and mutual influence among various green building environmental assessment dimensions. The Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique is applied to analyze the impact relationship. The analysis results reveal that, among four dimensions, the energy saving significantly impacts the other dimensions, while the waste reduction is influenced by others. Meanwhile, the analysis results indicate that the DEMATEL scheme is applicable to analyze green building system assessment dimensions. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.

Moreover, advances in biohydrogen production technologies based on organic wastewater conversion could solve the issues related to food security, climate change, energy security and clean development in the future. An evaluation of studies reported on biohydrogen production from different wastewaters will be of immense importance in economizing production technologies. Here we have reviewed biohydrogen production yields and rates from different wastewaters using sludges and microbial consortiums and evaluated the feasibility of biohydrogen production from unexplored wastewaters and development of integrated bioenergy process. Biohydrogen production has been observed in the range of substrate concentration 0.25-160 g COD/L, pH 4-8, temperature 23-60 °C, HRT 0.5-72 h with various types of reactor configuration.

84892364071	Batch fermentative hydrogen production by enriched mixed culture: Combination strategy and their microbial composition	The effect of individual and combined mixed culture on dark fermentative hydrogen production performance was investigated. Mixed cultures from cow dung (C1), sewage sludge (C2), and pig slurry (C3) were enriched under strict anaerobic conditions at 37°C with glucose as the sole carbon source. Biochemical hydrogen production test in peptone-yeast-glucose (PYG) and basal medium was performed for individual mixed cultures (C1, C2 and C3) and their combinations (C1-C2, C2-C3, C1-C3 and C1-C2-C3) at a glucose concentration of 10g/L, 37°C and initial pH 7. Maximum hydrogen yields (HY) of 2.0 and 1.86 molH2/molglucose by C2, and 1.98 and 1.95 molH2/molglucose by C2-C3 were obtained in PYG and basal medium, respectively. Butyrate and acetate were the major soluble metabolites produced by all the cultures, and the ratio of butyrate to acetate was ~2 fold higher in basal medium than PYG medium, indicating strong influence of media formulation on glucose catabolism. The major hydrogen-producing bacterial strains, observed in all mixed cultures, belonged to Clostridium butyricum, C. saccharobutylicum, C. tertium and C. perfringens. The hydrogen production performance of the combined mixed culture (C2-C3) was further evaluated on beverage wastewater (10g/L) at pH 7 and 37°C. The results showed an HY of 1.92 molH2/molglucose-equivalent. Experimental evidence suggests that hydrogen fermentation by mixed culture combination could be a novel strategy to improve the HY from industrial wastewater. © 2013 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

84894269158	Development of Green Energy Waste Activated Carbon for Removal of Trivalent Chromium: Equilibrium and Kinetic Modeling	The present work reports on the potential of using a modified activated carbon as an eco-friendly adsorbent (second stage waste), obtained from a bio-diesel waste production plant, for the removal of Cr(III) ions from aqueous solutions. Chemical activation of the green energy waste (GEW), using sulfuric acid as a dehydrating agent, was adapted in this study The effects of pH, contact time, dosage, and initial concentration were evaluated and optimized in a batch processing mode. The modified activated carbon was fully characterized to observe morphological changes using SEM, XRD, and FT-IR techniques. SEM images however, showed significant changes in the carbon morphology before and after the adsorption of Cr(III) ions. The adsorption results indicated that the equilibrium data were in accordance with the Langmuir isotherm, yielding a maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 171.0 mg g-1 at 29° C. Moreover, the kinetic studies indicated that the adsorption process followed a pseudo-second-order model. Assessment of our results revealed that GEW-AC was considered as a prospective adsorbent which could be used as a cost-effective substitute for marketable activated carbons for the removal of Cr(III) ions from wastewater systems. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84896826141	Biogenic hydrogen conversion of de-oiled jatropha waste via anaerobic sequencing batch reactor operation: Process performance, microbial insights, and CO 2 reduction efficiency	We report the semicontinuous, direct (anaerobic sequencing batch reactor operation) hydrogen fermentation of de-oiled jatropha waste (DJW). The effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) was studied and results show that the stable and peak hydrogen production rate of 1.48 L/Ld and hydrogen yield of 8.7 mL Hg volatile solid added were attained when the reactor was operated at HRT 2 days (d) with a DJW concentration of 200 g/L, temperature 55°C, and pH 6.5. Reduced HRT enhanced the production performance until 1.75 d. Further reduction has lowered the process efficiency in terms of biogas production and hydrogen gas content. The effluent from hydrogen fermentor was utilized for methane fermentation in batch reactors using pig slurry and cow dung as seed sources. The results revealed that pig slurry was a feasible seed source for methane generation. Peak methane production rate of 0.43 L CHLd and methane yield of 20.5 mL CHg COD were observed at substrate concentration of 10 g COD/L, temperature 30°C, and pH 7.0. PCR-DGGE analysis revealed that combination of celluloytic and fermentative bacteria were present in the hydrogen producing ASBR. © 2014 Gopalakrishnan Kumar and Chiu-Yue Lin.

84902023193	Scale-up and Commercial Applications of Biohydrogen Production Processes	Extensive researches in the past have shown substantial improvement and development in both the yield and the volumetric production rates of biohydrogen. Yet, for commercial-scale applications that are cost-effective, biohydrogen yields and production rates must outdo significantly the existing accomplishments. Until now, there have been no reports of a commercial-scale biohydrogen production system in the world. This chapter deals with technoeconomic evaluation, fundaments of scale-up, and pilot-scale studies to help in the setup of a commercial-scale system. The scale-up process with the key component of kinetics and hydrodynamics of a fermenter is further supported by data mining of reported pilot-scale systems. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84908297690	Commercial application scenario using patent analysis: Fermentative hydrogen production from biomass	The main purpose of this study is to use patent analysis to investigate scenarios for future commercial applications of dark fermentation or anaerobic fermentation using biomass or organic matter as feedstock materials. The first step in this study includes a patent search procedure and patent content interpretation, in which 29 technology patents were identified from the US patent database and divided into five groups in accordance with the scope of their technical applications. The following five scenarios of commercial applications of biomass fermentation for hydrogen production were established through a combination of group applications: screening and cultivation of hydrogen-producing bacteria, biomass waste sources, biomass energization application, value enhancement of waste or wastewater treatment systems, and the application of a multi-functional hydrogen production system integrated with other technologies.

0842326645	Fermentative hydrogen production at ambient temperature	The hydrogen productivity of a chemostat-type anaerobic reactor operating without pH control on a glucose-mineral salts feed at ambient temperatures (15-34°C) was examined. The reactor, with an inoculum from sewage sludge, operated continuously for 330 days at solids retention times (SRTs) varied manually in response to the progress of the fermentation. SRTs of 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.25 days were used at the temperatures of 15-18°C, 16-19°C, 24-28°C, 25-29°C, 28-32°C and 30-34°C, respectively. The sewage sludge microflora (dominated by Clostridium species) produced hydrogen during anaerobic acidogenic conversion of glucose at ambient temperatures. At the shortest tested SRT of 0.25 days, the organic loading rate was 416 mmol-glucose/l/day, the hydrogen productivity peaked with each mole of glucose in the temperature-uncontrolled fermenter converted into 1.42 mol of H
