1542642482	Low complexity design of fault-tolerant optical network with arbitrary mesh topology	We present a low-complexity algorithm for designing survivable optical mesh networks with arbitrary topology. In this class of problems, the geographic locations of the network nodes are given and the traffic demand between each source-destination pair is given by a traffic matrix. The problem is to optimize the total network cost that is characterized by three parameters for each link, namely, the installation cost, the bandwidth cost and the equipment cost. The problem is NP-hard. We tackle the problem by incorporating a modified drop algorithm (MDA) into an efficient spare-capacity planning algorithm SCAPE which is a low complexity heuristic for optimizing the allocation of spare capacities on a given topology network to render it fully single-fault (or multi-faults) tolerant. Joint optimization for the topology design, working- and spare-capacity planning is shown for the first time, and we show that joint optimization can result in a cost reduction of about 28% for a 10-node network.

1842533429	Least Squares Algorithms for Time-of-Arrival-Based Mobile Location	Localization of mobile phones is of considerable interest in wireless communications. In this correspondence, two algorithms are developed for accurate mobile location using the time-of-arrival measurements of the signal from the mobile station received at three or more base stations. The first algorithm is an unconstrained least squares (LS) estimator that has implementation simplicity. The second algorithm solves a nonconvex constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) problem for improving estimation accuracy. It is shown that the CWLS estimator yields better performance than the LS method and achieves both the Cram√©r-Rao lower bound and the optimal circular error probability at sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio conditions.

18944372848	Framework for planning survivable optical mesh network with dynamic demands and single link failure protection	We introduce a new survivable network concept called the "Generalized Survivable Network" (GSN), which has the special property that it remains survivable no matter how traffic is provisioned dynamically, as long as the input and output constraints at the nodes are fixed. We study a network synthesis problem called the Virtual Topology Mapping Problem (VTMP), which aims at finding the edge capacities for a given physical network topology with the I/O constraints at the nodes that will make it a GSN. Two concepts, tau-matization and sigma-tization are introduced. Taumatization refers to the conversion of any physical network into a non-blocking network. Sigma-tization refers to the conversion of a multi-edge-connected network into a fully survivable network with the necessary edge capacities. We develop a basic framework for solving the VTMP problem of GSN. We obtain a lower bounding procedure, an upper bounding procedure and a heuristic called MMRA for solving the tau-matization problem. The lower bounding procedure has a very nice analytic form that can be solved by the simplex method in polynomial time. Some experimental results are given. We have shown that the actual cost of developing a GSN with the MMRA heuristic is within 10-35% from the absolute lower bound and much less than the tremendous cost that is generally thought would be needed to realize a GSN (a reduction of 85% to 95% from the upper bound). The framework is applicable to ASTN / ASON survivable network planning and bandwidth-on-demand resource allocation.

18944376404	Low-cost, scalable TV/video on-demand distribution over telco networks	With the proliferation of IP networking and wireless access, local exchange carriers (LEC) are under tremendous pressure to evolve into broadband service providers. On-demand video distribution to the mass appears to be one of the best evolution paths for the LEC. Various approaches for providing on-demand content/video distribution to massive viewers are compared. In particular, a novel low-cost network architecture called DINA for distributing video content to massive viewers is described. DINA employs hybrid multicast-unicast streaming to achieve scalability. Furthermore, it offers full interactive functions to the viewers and readily deployable over existing broadband network infrastructures. An innovative technique to offer low-cost on-demand video services to massive subscribers called multi-stream multicasting is described. It employs fixed but irregular stream intervals that can significantly reduce the startup latency. Many fault protection mechanisms are built into the DINA architecture to improve the robustness. DINA also offers additional protection against copyright infringement and has been demonstrated commercially.

0030166255	A fast channel-tunable optical transmitter for ultrahigh-speed all-optical time-division multiaccess networks	This paper describes the design and the experimental demonstration of a novel fast channel tunable optical transmitter which is suitable for ultrahigh-speed all-optical time-division multiaccess (TDMA) networks. This optical transmitter is capable of performing fast channel tuning and data modulation in a simple and cost-effective way without using the expensive optical modulators and optical switches. By employing this transmitter, together with the proposed destructive writing scheme, ultrahigh-speed channel multiplexing with relaxed synchronization requirements for data access can be achieved. The demonstrated prototype can be arbitrarily tuned to any one of the 16 1-Gb/s channels in a 16-Gb/s all-optical TDMA network with channel switching time less than 5 ns. This is suitable for use in most high-speed optical time-division multiplexed (TDM) systems and tunable-channel multiaccess (TCMA) networks.

The research presented in this paper is concerned with measurement, characterization and modeling of the indoor wideband channel response in the 1.75-1.85 GHz frequency band. In order to investigate and model the wideband channel characteristics for indoor environments, time delay profile measurements have been taken inside a modern building with receiver-transmitter separations from 5-30m.

It is a simple multi-channel network protocol suitable for photonic implementation. It adopts slotted cycle to transmit packets and the cycle length is dynamically adjusted according to the network load. We study the performance of the ACTA protocol both for single-channel and multi-channel integrated services operations. Through the simulations, we have shown that the overhead of channel tuning is quite small. We also study the priority mechanism of ACTA, and analyze the relation between the node transmission quota and bandwidth allocation. In addition, we present a slot reuse scheme which requires only one additional access control bit, and demonstrate great improvement in network utilization. The simulation results show that ACTA network is a very promising candidate for the future high speed multimedia networks.

It uses the inter-communications among adjacent nodes to facilitate restoration and can operate in normal and revertive modes. The normal mode allows fast network recovery while the revertive mode returns the network status back to normal state after the failures have been removed. The validity of the scheme was tested on a high-speed multimedia network prototype designed at the Chinese University of Hong Kong - CUMLAUDE NET. In laboratory testing, the completion times for both operation modes are found to be within a milli-second. Performance measures including communicative probability and survivability are used to quantify the network reliability under the scheme.

The analysis, which was mainly based on routing which involves the intensity dependent phase shift due to self phase modulation, showed that in ultrafast all optical switching using NOLM or nonlinear amplifying loop mirrors, the extinction/contrast ratio is degraded due to the pedestal effect and directional gain difference. Furthermore, the use of the walk-off effect of an additional NOLM to improve the extinction ratio was indicated to be a possible solution to the degradation problem.

0031354625	Local map based (LMB) self-healing scheme for arbitrary topology networks	In this paper, a Local Map Based (LMB) network self-healing scheme is proposed. It uses the network topology information available in small-sized data tables, known as local maps, stored in each network node to restore disrupted traffic. The size of the local maps can be varied to cope with different types of failures. The time-consuming alternate-path seeking process in the distributed restoration is replaced by simple searching and sorting algorithms executed in individual DCS node. This allows localized restoration and leads to significant improvement in failure recovery time, spare resource utilization and restoration message volume. Simulations with different sets of parameters have shown that the restoration time is well below the standard 2-second service restoration objective.

Multiple wavelengths with empty slots are generated as shared channels from the head node. Each transceiver comprises a tunable transmitter and a fixed receiver. For data transmission, the node can compete for empty slots on the wavelength channel assigned to the destined node. If the node has nothing to send, all wavelengths are forwarded to the next node without any local processing. The proposed network node is demonstrated in a four-wavelength WDMA packet network with a channel spacing of 100 GHz.

We point out that due to the asymmetric gain/loss of the two counter-propagating directions in the loop and the pulse pedestal effects, both of the above parameters are always degraded. In this paper, theoretical and numerical analyses of the such degradations based on both self-phase modulation (SPM) and cross-phase modulation (XPM) with different input pulse shapes are presented The results provide better understanding of the performance limitation of loop mirrors as ultrafast multi-/demultiplexers.

33745234791	Capacity planning of a wide-sense nonblocking generalized survivable network	Generalized survivable networks (GSNs) have two interesting properties that are essential attributes for future backbone networks - full survivability against link failures and support for dynamic traffic demands. GSNs incorporate the nonblocking network concept into the survivable network models. Given a set of nodes and a topology that is at least two-edge connected, a certain minimum capacity is required for each edge to form a GSN. The edge capacity is bounded because each node has an input-output capacity limit that serves as a constraint for any allowable traffic demand matrix. The GSN capacity planning problem is nondeterministic polynomial time (NP) hard. We first give a rigorous mathematical framework; then we offer two different solution approaches. The two-phase approach is fast, but the joint optimization approach yields a better bound. We carried out numerical computations for eight networks with different topologies and found that the cost of a GSN is only a fraction (from 52% to 89%) more than that of a static survivable network. ¬© 2006 Optical Society of America.

33746582376	A constrained least squares approach to mobile positioning: Algorithms and optimality	The problem of locating a mobile terminal has received significant attention in the field of wireless communications. Time-of-arrival(TOA), received signal strength (RSS), time-difference-of-arrival(TDOA), and angle-of-arrival (AOA) are commonly used measurements for estimating the position of the mobile station. In this paper,we present a constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) mobile positioning approach that encompasses all the above described measurement cases. The advantages of CWLS include performance optimality and capability of extension to hybrid measurement cases(e.g., mobile positioning using TDOA and AOA measurements jointly). Assuming zero-mean uncorrelated measurement errors, we show by mean and variance analysis that all the developed CWLS location estimators achieve zero bias and the Cram√©r-Rao lower bound approximately when measurement error variances are small.The asymptotic optimum performance is also confirmed by simulation results.

33645012856	Capacity planning of link restorable optical networks under dynamic change of traffic	Future backbone networks shall require full-survivability and support dynamic changes of traffic demands. The Generalized Survivable Networks (GSN) was proposed to meet these challenges. GSN is fully-survivable under dynamic traffic demand changes, so it offers a practical and guaranteed characterization framework for ASTN / ASON survivable network planning and bandwidth-on-demand resource allocation4. The basic idea of GSN is to incorporate the non-blocking network concept into the survivable network models. In GSN, each network node must specify its I/O capacity bound which is taken as constraints for any allowable traffic demand matrix. In this paper, we consider the following generic GSN network design problem: Given the I/O bounds of each network node, find a routing scheme (and the corresponding rerouting scheme under failure) and the link capacity assignment (both working and spare) which minimize the cost, such that any traffic matrix consistent with the given I/O bounds can be feasibly routed and it is single-fault tolerant under the link restoration scheme. We first show how the initial, infeasible formal mixed integer programming formulation can be transformed into a more feasible problem using the duality transformation of the linear program. Then we show how the problem can be simplified using the Lagrangian Relaxation approach. Previous work has outlined a two-phase approach for solving this problem where the first phase optimizes the working capacity assignment and the second phase optimizes the spare capacity assignment. In this paper, we present a jointly optimized framework for dimensioning the survivable optical network with the GSN model. Experiment results show that the jointly optimized GSN can bring about on average of 3.8% cost savings when compared with the separate, two-phase approach. Finally, we perform a cost comparison and show that GSN can be deployed with a reasonable cost.

77954554505	SSLock: Sustaining the trust on entities brought by SSL	We propose a new, simple and effective domain segmentation approach to sustain SSL protection which is usually compromised when users are expected to perform legitimacy judgment. It has been established that using security warnings and indicators is a serious operational flaw of SSL. As a security-critical system, SSL should never rely on users' judgment as the ultimate defense because adversaries that exploit users' ignorance and illiteracy are sufficient to break the most secure system. The proposal simply requires a service provider to opt-in by hosting its service in a special subdomain "secure". The enhanced protection will then be automatically in force. In this paper, we consider three severe and characteristic attack models, namely dynamic pharming, deceptive captive portal and SSLStrip attacks, and we show that there is no single defeating solution except SSLock. We have conducted deployability analysis which further justifies the proposal in terms of its high compatibility rate. SSLock is the only approach that is generic and light-weight for application vendors, opt-in and zero-initialization for service providers, and privacy-preserving and idiot-proof for generic users. ¬© 2010 ACM.

84867088441	Horizontal scaling and shearing-based disparity-compensated prediction for stereo video coding	In multiview video coding (MVC), disparity-compensated prediction (DCP) exploits the correlation among different views. A common approach is to use block-based motion-compensated prediction (MCP) tools to predict the disparity effect among different views. However, some regions in different views may have various deformations due to nonconstant depth. Thus, performance of DCP is not satisfactory with the simple translational model assumed in conventional block-based MCP tools. Previous attempts to achieve better disparity prediction were usually too complex for practical use. In this paper, horizontal scaling and shearing (HSS) effects are investigated to increase interview prediction accuracy for stereo video. HSS deformations are common among images of horizontally aligned views, due to horizontal and vertical flat surfaces that are not parallel with projection image planes. To achieve HSS-based DCP with minimal complexity, an efficient subsampled block-matching technique is adopted and integrated into MVC extension of H.264/AVC in stereo profile. Affine parameters estimation and additional frame buffers are not required and the overall increase of computational complexity and memory requirements are moderate. Experimental results show that the new technique can achieve up to 5.25% bitrate reduction in interview prediction using JM17.0 reference software implementation. ¬© 1991-2012 IEEE.

84897657883	Adaptive depth truncation filter for MVC based compressed depth image	In multiview video plus depth (MVD) format, virtual views are generated from decoded texture videos with corresponding decoded depth images through depth image based rendering (DIBR). 3DV-ATM is a reference model for the H.264/AVC based multiview video coding (MVC) and aims at achieving high coding efficiency for 3D video in MVD format. Depth images are first downsampled then coded by 3DV-ATM. However, sharp object boundary characteristic of depth images does not well match with the transform coding based nature of H.264/AVC in 3DV-ATM. Depth boundaries are often blurred with ringing artifacts in the decoded depth images that result in noticeable artifacts in synthesized virtual views. This paper presents a low complexity adaptive depth truncation filter to recover the sharp object boundaries of the depth images using adaptive block repositioning and expansion for increasing the depth values refinement accuracy. This new approach is very efficient and can avoid false depth boundary refinement when block boundaries lie around the depth edge regions and ensure sufficient information within the processing block for depth layers classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the sharp depth edges can be recovered using the proposed filter and boundary artifacts in the synthesized views can be removed. The proposed method can provide improvement up to 3.25 dB in the depth map enhancement and bitrate reduction of 3.06% in the synthesized views. ¬© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

4344664013	Accurate approximation algorithm for TOA-based maximum likelihood mobile location using semidefinite programming	The techniques of using wireless cellular networks to locate mobile stations have recently received considerable interest. This paper addresses the problem of maximum-likelihood (ML) location estimation using (uplink) time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements. Under the standard assumption of Gaussian TOA measurement errors, ML location estimation is a nonconvex optimization problem in which the presence of local minima makes the search of the globally optimal solution hard. To circumvent this difficulty, we propose to approximate the ML problem by relaxing it to a convex optimization problem, namely semidefinite programming. Simulation results indicate that this semidefinite relaxation location estimator provides mean square position error performance close to the Cram√©r-Rao lower bound for a wide range of TOA measurement error levels.

44949197001	A new approach for designing the next generation survivable backbone network	There is a great need to devise new planning methodology to deal with the tremendously growing but highly unpredictable IP traffic. Two key requirements for future backbone networks are dynamic service provisioning and full survivability.

GSN is a generalization of the non-blocking network concept to the survivable network models and has the special property that it remains survivable no matter how traffic is provisioned dynamically, as long as the input and output capacity constraints at the nodes remained unchanged.

We present a complete mathematical framework for designing both types of GSN.

62949224034	Multi-direction search algorithm for block-based motion estimation	Easily trapped in local minima is one of the well-known problems in search point pattern based fast block motion estimation algorithms. This problem is especially serious in one-at-a-time search (OTS) and block-based gradient descent search (BBGDS). These two algorithms can provide very high speedup ratio but with low robustness in prediction accuracy especially for sequences with complex motions.

To tackle this problem, a novel multidirectional gradient descent search (MDGDS) is proposed in this paper with use of multiple OTSs in eight directions. Basically, the proposed MDGDS performs eight one-dimensional gradient descent searches on the error surface and therefore can trace to the global minimum more efficiently.

65349129665	Generalized survivable network	Two important requirements for future backbone networks are full survivability against link failures and dynamic bandwidth provisioning. We demonstrate how these two requirements can be met by introducing a new survivable network concept called the Generalized Survivable Network (GSN), which has the special property that it remains survivable no matter how traffic is provisioned dynamically, as long as the input and output constraints at the nodes are fixed. A rigorous mathematical framework for designing the GSN is presented. In particular, we focus on the GSN Capacity Planning Problem, which finds the edge capacities for a given physical network topology with the input/output constraints at the nodes. We employ fixed single-path routing which leads to wide-sense nonblocking GSNs. We show how the initial, infeasible formal mixed integer linear programming formulation can be transformed into a more feasible problem using the duality transformation.

The latter type of algorithms, however, is more suitable for handling large motion content. To combine the advantages of both types of algorithms, an adaptive algorithm performing search patterns switching (SPS) is proposed in this paper. The proposed SPS algorithm classifies the motion content of a block using a simple yet efficient motion content classifier called error descent rate. Unlike other classifiers with heavy overhead, this classifier requires only the searching of a few points in the search window and then a division operation. Experimental results show that the proposed SPS algorithm is very robust. ¬© 2009 IEEE.

66749099467	Network planning under uncertainties	One of the main focuses for network planning is on the optimization of network resources required to build a network under certain traffic demand projection. Traditionally, the inputs to this type of network planning problems are treated as deterministic. In reality, the varying traffic requirements and fluctuations in network resources can cause uncertainties in the decision models. The failure to include the uncertainties in the network design process can severely affect the feasibility and economics of the network. Therefore, it is essential to find a solution that can be insensitive to the uncertain conditions during the network planning process. As early as in the 1960's, a network planning problem with varying traffic requirements over time had been studied. Up to now, this kind of network planning problems is still being active researched, especially for the VPN network design. Another kind of network planning problems under uncertainties that has been studied actively in the past decade addresses the fluctuations in network resources. One such hotly pursued research topic is survivable network planning. It considers the design of a network under uncertainties brought by the fluctuations in topology to meet the requirement that the network remains intact up to a certain number of faults occurring anywhere in the network. Recently, the authors proposed a new planning methodology called Generalized Survivable Network that tackles the network design problem under both varying traffic requirements and fluctuations of topology. Although all the above network planning problems handle various kinds of uncertainties, it is hard to find a generic framework under more general uncertainty conditions that allows a more systematic way to solve the problems. With a unified framework, the seemingly diverse models and algorithms can be intimately related and possibly more insights and improvements can be brought out for solving the problem. This motivates us to seek a generic framework for solving the network planning problem under uncertainties. In addition to reviewing the various network planning problems involving uncertainties, we also propose that a unified framework based on robust optimization can be used to solve a rather large segment of network planning problem under uncertainties. Robust optimization is first introduced in the operations research literature and is a framework that incorporates information about the uncertainty sets for the parameters in the optimization model. Even though robust optimization is originated from tackling the uncertainty in the optimization process, it can serve as a comprehensive and suitable framework for tackling generic network planning problems under uncertainties. In this paper, we begin by explaining the main ideas behind the robust optimization approach. Then we demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework by giving out some examples of how the robust optimization framework can be applied to the current common network planning problems under uncertain environments. Next, we list some practical considerations for solving the network planning problem under uncertainties with the proposed framework. Finally, we conclude this article with some thoughts on the future directions for applying this framework to solve other network planning problems. ¬© 2008 SPIE.

69449091768	Novel directional gradient descent searches for fast block motion estimation	Search point pattern-based fast block motion estimation algorithms provide significant speedup for motion estimation but usually suffer from being easily trapped in local minima. This may lead to low robustness in prediction accuracy particularly for video sequences with complex motions. This problem is especially serious in one-at-a-time search (OTS) and block-based gradient descent search (BBGDS), which provide very high speedup ratio. A multipath search using more than one search path has been proposed to improve the robustness of BBGDS but the computational requirement is much increased. To tackle this drawback, a novel directional gradient descent search (DGDS) algorithm using multiple OTSs and gradient descent searches on the error surface in eight directions is proposed in this letter. The search point patterns in each stage depend on the minima found in these eight directions, and thus the global minimum can be traced more efficiently. In addition, a fast version of the DGDS (FDGDS) algorithm is also described to further improve the speed of DGDS. Experimental results show that DGDS reduces computation load significantly compared with the well-known fast block motion estimation algorithms. Moreover, FDGDS can achieve faster speedup compared with the UMHexagonS algorithm in H.264/AVC implementation while maintaining very similar rate-distortion performance. ¬© 2009 IEEE.

70449579385	Block-matching translation and zoom motion-compensated prediction	In modern video coding standards, motion compensated prediction (MCP) plays a key role to achieve video compression efficiency. Most of them make use of block matching techniques and assume the motions are pure translational. Attempts toward a more general motion model are usually too complex to be practical in near future. In this paper, a new Block-Matching Translation and Zoom Motion-Compensated Prediction (BTZMP) is proposed to extend the pure translational model to a more general model with zooming. It adopts the camera zooming and object motions that becomes zooming while projected on video frames. Experimental results show that BTZMP can give prediction gain up to 2.25dB for various sequences compared to conventional block-matching MCP. BTZMP can also be incorporated with multiple reference frames technique to give extra improvement, evidentially by the prediction gain ranging from 2.03 to 3.68dB in the empirical simulations. ¬©2009 IEEE.

77949577364	Multiple block-size search algorithm for fast block motion estimation	Although variable block-size motion estimation provides significant video quality and coding efficiency improvement, it requires much higher computational complexity compared with fixed block size motion estimation. The reason is that the current motion estimation algorithms are mainly designed for fixed block size. Current variable block-size motion estimation implementation simply applies these existing motion estimation algorithms independently for different block sizes to find the best block size and the corresponding motion vector. Substantial computation is wasted because distortion data reuse among motion searches of different block sizes is not considered. In this paper, a motion estimation algorithm intrinsically designed for variable block-size video coding is presented. The proposed multiple block-size search (MBSS) algorithm unifies the motion searches for different block sizes into a single searching process instead of independently performing the search for each block size. In this unified search, the suboptimal motion vectors for different block sizes are used to determine the next search steps. Its prediction quality is comparable with that obtained by performing motion search for different block sizes independently while the computational load is substantially reduced. Experimental results show that the prediction quality of MBSS is similar to full search. ¬©2009 IEEE.

78149320224	Subsampled block-matching for zoom motion compensated prediction	Motion compensated prediction plays a vital role in achieving enormous video compression efficiency in advanced video coding standards. Most practical motion compensated prediction techniques implicitly assume pure translational motions in the video contents for effective operation. Some attempts aiming at more general motion models are usually too complex requiring parameter estimation in practical implementation. In this paper, zoom motion compensation is investigated to extend the assumed model to support both zoom and translation motions. To accomplish practical complexity, a novel and efficient subsampled block-matching zoom motion estimation technique is proposed which makes use of the interpolated reference frames for subpixel motion estimation in a conventional hybrid video coding structure. Specially designed subsampling patterns in block matching are used to realize the translation and zoom motion estimation and compensation. No zoom parameters estimation and additional frame buffers are required in the encoder implementation. The complexity of the decoder is similar to the conventional hybrid video codec that supports subpixel motion compensation. The overall increase in memory requirement and computational complexity is moderate. Experimental results show that the new technique can achieve up to 9.89% bitrate reduction using KTA2.2r1 reference software implementation. ¬© 2006 IEEE.

Two key factors for constructing wind farm are considered in this study. They are wind availability and wind speed. Because of the "undispatchable" nature of wind and the difficulty in forecasting, the wind availability and wind speed are random and uncertainty. Thus, the deterministic method is not appropriate to handle them. This paper uses fuzzy number to deal with the wind availability and wind speed. The term of average unavailable time (AUAT) is introduced in order to compute the probability of average wind availability.

78650341278	HTTPSLock: Enforcing HTTPS in unmodified browsers with cached javascript	HTTPS is designed to protect a connection against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. HTTPS is however often compromised and voided when users are to embrace invalid certificates or disregard if HTTPS is being used. The current HTTPS deployment relies on unsophisticated users to safeguard themselves by performing legitimacy judgment. We propose HTTPSLock, a simple and immediate approach to enforce HTTPS security. HTTPSLock can be deployed to a website with a valid certificate by simply including several Javascript and HTML files, which will be cached in browsers. Similar to the trust-on-first-use model used by SSH, the trusted code cached on the client-side can effectively enforce the use of HTTPS and forbid users to embrace invalid certificates for any compromised networks subsequently encountered. Over 72% of major web browsers are supported, and further growth is expected. In any situation where the protection is unsupported or expired, the current security standard is gracefully maintained. As desired, the deployment is not hindered by standardization and collaboration from browser vendors as with other proposals. ¬© 2010 IEEE.

78651078448	Automatic 2D-To-3D video conversion technique based on depth-from-motion and color segmentation	Most of the TV manufacturers have released 3DTVs in the summer of 2010 using shutter-glasses technology. 3D video applications are becoming popular in our daily life, especially at home entertainment. Although more and more 3D movies are being made, 3D video contents are still not rich enough to satisfy the future 3D video market. There is a rising demand on new techniques for automatically converting 2D video content to stereoscopic 3D video displays. In this paper, an automatic monoscopic video to stereoscopic 3D video conversion scheme is presented using block-based depth from motion estimation and color segmentation for depth map enhancement. The color based region segmentation provides good region boundary information, which is used to fuse with block-based depth map for eliminating the staircase effect and assigning good depth value in each segmented region.

However, the DC mode in the Multiple-Prediction of the AIMBS becomes much less effective. To tackle this problem and further improve the coding efficiency, distance-based weighted prediction (DWP) is proposed to replace DC mode in Multiple-Prediction for predicting blocks without directional preferences. The proposed method is named as AIMBS-DWP that can enhance the robustness of AIMBS in much larger range of QPs and achieve higher rate-distortion performance. Experimental results show that an average bitrate reduction of 3.79% with lower computational requirement can be obtained by AIMBS-DWP as compared with H.264/AVC. The improvement is especially obvious in high visual quality configurations with small QPs. ¬© 2010 IEEE.

79952120956	Block-matching translational and rotational motion compensated prediction using interpolated reference frame	Motion compensated prediction (MCP) implemented in most video coding schemes is based on translational motion model. However, nontranslational motions, for example, rotational motions, are common in videos. Higher-order motion model researches try to enhance the prediction accuracy of MCP by modeling those nontranslational motions. However, they require affine parameter estimation, and most of them have very high computational complexity. In this paper, a translational and rotational MCP method using special subsampling in the interpolated frame is proposed. This method is simple to implement and has low computational complexity. Experimental results show that many blocks can be better predicted by the proposed method, and therefore a higher prediction quality can be achieved with acceptable overheads. We believe this approach opens a new direction in MCP research. Copyright ¬© 2010 Ka-Ho Ng, et al.

0036454767	Capacity planning for fault-tolerant all-optical network	Future communication networks will carry many WDM channels at very high bit rate. Thus, it is desirable to avoid electronic switching at the core. The all-optical backbone network can be interconnected by optical cross-connects at strategic locations to allow for flexible capacity provisioning and fault-tolerant rerouting. Such an all-optical core layer nicely decouples the long-term capacity planning problem from the short-term dynamic bandwidth allocation problem which can be better tackled in the electronic domain. An essential requirement for the all-optical core layer is that it must be fully fault-tolerant, otherwise, a single failed link can cause a disaster for the entire network. We consider the problem of how to allocate the required capacities and spare capacities on a given all-optical core network so as to make the network fully single-fault (or multi-faults) tolerant. The objective function is the total cost of the spare fibers. Based on a given traffic requirement on all source-destination pairs, the optimal bandwidth requirement for each link in the given topology is first computed. We then consider link failures one-by-one for the entire network. For each link failure, we show how spare capacity can be added in other links so as to take advantage of existing spare capacities that have already been added. The algorithm is based on the shortest path routing algorithm and has a polynomial time complexity. Preliminary investigations suggest that the algorithm can give results comparable to those obtained by integer programming.

80051614034	Stretching, compression and shearing disparity compensated prediction techniques for stereo and multiview video coding	In multiview video coding, disparity compensated prediction exploits the correlation among different views. A common approach is to use the conventional motion compensated prediction to predict disparity effect among different views. However, the same object in different views usually has deformation of different extents and, thus, accurate disparity prediction cannot be achieved with such simple translational motion model. Previous attempts to achieve more accurate disparity prediction are usually too complex for practical implementation. In this paper, stretching, compression and shearing (SCSH) effects are investigated to better model the disparity effect in disparity compensated prediction. To achieve SCSH effects with minimal computation, an efficient disparity compensated prediction using subsampled block-matching technique is proposed. No affine parameters estimation or additional frame buffers is required and the overall increase in memory requirement and computational complexity is moderate. Experimental results show that the new technique can achieve up to 4.84% bitrate reduction in inter-view prediction using JM17.0 reference software implementation. ¬© 2011 IEEE.

Text input can be performed by finger sliding over the virtual keyboard, which is well realized by the Swype technology on a typical QWERTY keyboard. Such shorthand gesturing for text input, however, may be inefficient when directly applied to Chinese input, especially in Chinese stroke-based input method. In this paper, a novel dynamic candidate keypad with use of unidirectional finger gesture on the stroke key for character selection is proposed for enhancing stroke-based Chinese input method. The new design can enhance frequently used Chinese characters searching and input using stroke-based input. The new method is implemented on the Android 2.2 platform for performance evaluation using Traditional Chinese characters set.

0036971029	Spatial coefficient partitioning for lossless wavelet image coding	In pyramidal wavelet representation, an image is decomposed into multiresolution and multifrequency subbands with sets of tree-structured coefficients, i.e. a spatial orientation tree which consists of coefficients at different resolutions and different orientations but associated with the same spatial location. The magnitudes of the coefficients in these trees measure the signal activity level of the corresponding spatial areas. A novel coefficient partitioning algorithm is introduced for splitting the coefficients into two sets using a spatial orientation tree data structure. By splitting the coefficients, the overall theoretical entropy is reduced due to the different probability distributions for the two coefficient sets. In the spatial domain, it is equivalent to identifying smooth regions of the image. A lossless coder based on this spatial coefficient partitioning has a better coding performance than other wavelet-based lossless image coders such as S + P and JPEG-2000.

84867583903	A foreground biased depth map refinement method for DIBR view synthesis	The performance of view synthesis using depth image based rendering (DIBR) highly depends on the accuracy of depth map. Inaccurate boundary alignment between texture image and depth map especially for large depth discontinuities always cause annoying artifacts in disocclusion regions of the synthesized view. Pre-filtering approach and reliability-based approach have been proposed to tackle this problem. However, pre-filtering approach blurs the depth map with drawback of degradation of the depth map and may also cause distortion in non-hole region. Reliability-based approach uses reliable warping information from other views to fill up holes and is not suitable for the view synthesis with single texture video such as video-plus-depth based DIBR applications. This paper presents a simple and efficient depth map preprocessing method with use of texture edge information to refine depth pixels around the large depth discontinuities. The refined depth map can make the whole texture edge pixels assigned with foreground depth values. It can significantly improve the quality of the synthesized view by avoiding incorrect use of foreground texture information in hole filling. The experimental results show the proposed method achieves superior performance for view synthesis by DIBR especially for large baseline. ¬© 2012 IEEE.

84869431322	Watershed and Random Walks based depth estimation for semi-automatic 2D to 3D image conversion	Depth map estimation from a single image is the key problem for the 2D to 3D image conversion. Many 2D to 3D converting processes, either automatic or semi-automatic, are proposed before. Quality of the depth map from automatic methods is low and there exists wrong depth values due to errors estimation in depth cue extraction. The semi-automatic approaches can generate a better quality of depth map based on the user-defined labels, which indicate a rough estimation of depth values in the scene, to generate the rest of depth value and reconstruct the stereoscopic image. However, they require complexity system and are very computational intensive. A simplified approach is to combine the depth maps from Graph Cuts and Random Walks to persevering the sharp boundary and fine detail inside the objects. The drawback is the time consuming of the energy minimization in the Graph Cuts. In this paper, a fast Watershed segmentation based on the priority queue, which indicates the neighbor distance relationship, is used to replace the Graph Cuts to generate the hard constraints depth map. It is appended to the neighbor cost in the Random Walks to generate the final depth map with hard constraints in the objects boundaries regions and fine detail inside objects. The Watershed and Random Walks are low computational intensive and can achieve approximate real time estimation which results in a fast stereoscopic conversion process. Experimental results demonstrate that it can produce good quality stereoscopic image in very short time. ¬© 2012 IEEE.

84869388339	Enhanced adaptive intra mode bit skip for H.264/AVC	Adaptive intra mode bit skip (AIMBS) can improve the coding efficiency of intra coding in H.264/AVC. However, it has two shortcomings: one is that DC mode is not effectively handled in AIMBS as DC mode is duplicated in both Single-Prediction and Multiple-Prediction processing; the other is that AIMBS does not well match the most probable mode (MPM) estimation scheme of H.264/AVC. To tackle these two shortcomings, an enhanced AIMBS (EAIMBS) scheme with larger bitrate reduction and better QP robustness is presented. In addition, EAIMBS almost maintains as low computational complexity as AIMBS. The proposed technique introduces distance-based weighted prediction (DWP) to replace DC mode in Multiple-Prediction and it calculates the MPM by simplified L-shaped most probable mode estimation (SLMPME) method. Experimental results show that EAIMBS gives in average 3.97% bit-rate reduction and 51% computation reduction at QP=32 compared with H.264/AVC. ¬© 2012 IEEE.

84883400571	Depth-aided exemplar-based hole filling for DIBR view synthesis	Quality of synthesized view by Depth-Image-Based Rendering (DIBR) highly depends on hole filling, especially for synthesized view with large disocclusion. Many hole filling methods are proposed to improve the synthesized view quality and inpainting is the most popular approach to recover the disocclusions. However, the conventional inpainting either makes the hole regions blurred via diffusion or propagates the foreground information to the disoclusion regions. Annoying artifacts are created in the synthesized virtual views. This paper proposes a depth-aided exemplar-based inpainting method for recovering large disoclusion. It consists of two processes, warped depth map filling and warped color image filling. Since depth map can be considered as a grey-scale image without texture, it is much easier to be filled. Disoccluded regions of color image are predicted based on its associated filled depth map information. Regions with texture lying around the background have higher priority to be filled than other regions and disoccluded regions are filled by propagating the background texture through the exemplar-based inpainting. Thus artifacts created by diffusion or using foreground information for prediction can be eliminated. Experimental results show texture can be recovered in large disocclusions and the proposed method has better visual quality compared to existing methods. ¬© 2013 IEEE.

84884589127	Depth map misalignment correction and dilation for DIBR view synthesis	The quality of the synthesized views by Depth Image Based Rendering (DIBR) highly depends on the accuracy of the depth map, especially the alignment of object boundaries of texture image. In practice, the misalignment of sharp depth map edges is the major cause of the annoying artifacts at the disoccluded regions of the synthesized views. Conventional smooth filter approach blurs the depth map to reduce the disoccluded regions. The drawbacks are the degradation of 3D perception of the reconstructed 3D videos and the destruction of the texture in background regions. Conventional edge preserving filter utilizes the color image information in order to align the depth edges with color edges. Unfortunately, the characteristics of color edges and depth edges are very different which causes annoying boundaries artifacts in the synthesized virtual views. Recent solution of reliability-based approach uses reliable warping information from other views to fill the holes. However, it is not suitable for the view synthesis in video-plus-depth based DIBR applications. In this paper, a new depth map preprocessing approach is proposed. It utilizes Watershed color segmentation method to correct the depth map misalignment and then the depth map object boundaries are extended to cover the transitional edge regions of color image. This approach can handle the sharp depth map edges lying inside or outside the object boundaries in 2D sense. The quality of the disoccluded regions of the synthesized views can be significantly improved and unknown depth values can also be estimated. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance for view synthesis by DIBR especially for generating large baseline virtual views. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84893553087	An adaptive background biased depth map hole-filling method for Kinect	The launch of Kinect provides a convenient way to access the depth information in real time. However the depth map quality still needs to be enhanced for 3D visual applications. In this paper, an adaptive background biased depth map hole-filling method is proposed. First, depth holes caused by abnormal reflection are filled by color similarity in-painting, and a soft decision for color similarity checking is performed by the use of probabilities in random walks color segmentation. Afterwards it is assumed that the lost information in the rest of depth holes belongs to the background. The background depth information is extracted by automatic thresholding in the neighborhood of each hole. Depth holes are in-painted with the background information in their local neighborhood. Combination of color similarity in-painting and background biased in-painting is able to perform depth map hole-filling adaptively for different kinds of depth holes for Kinect. The hole-filling results and virtual view synthesis results show that the Kinect depth map quality can be improved significantly by the proposed method. ¬© 2013 IEEE.

84905275727	Adaptive block truncation filter for MVC depth image enhancement	In Multiview Video plus Depth (MVD) format, virtual views are generated from decoded texture videos with decoded depth images through Depth Image based Rendering (DIBR). 3DV-ATM is a reference model for H.264/AVC based Multiview Video Coding (MVC) and aims at achieving high coding efficiency for 3D video in MVD format. Depth images are first downsampled then coded by 3DV-ATM. However, sharp object boundary characteristic of depth images does not well match with the transform coding of 3DV-ATM. Depth boundaries are often blurred with ringing artifacts in the decoded depth images that result in noticeable artifacts in synthesized views. This paper presents a low complexity adaptive block truncation filter to recover the sharp object boundaries of depth images using adaptive block repositioning and expansion for increasing the depth values refinement accuracy. This new approach is very efficient and can avoid false depth boundary refinement when block boundaries lie around the depth edge regions and ensure sufficient information within the processing block for depth layers classification. Experimental results show that sharp depth edges can be recovered using the proposed filter and boundary artifacts in the synthesized views can be removed. The proposed method can provide improvement up to 3.25dB in the depth map enhancement and bitrate reduction of 3.06% in the synthesized views. ¬© 2014 IEEE.
