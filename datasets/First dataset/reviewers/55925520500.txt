33751538836	Fingerprint analysis of Flos Carthami by pressurized CEC and LC	A fingerprint analysis of Flos Carthami was performed using a standardized capillary electrochromatography (CEC) procedure. This procedure was first used to establish the electrochromatographic profile of genuine Flos Carthami from Tacheng, Xinjiang, China. This Flos Carthami fingerprint was then used to identify and assess the consistency of raw herbs from different sources in China. The study of a limited number of samples from ten different sources demonstrated a reasonable consistency among their CEC fingerprints relative to that of the genuine sample. Using this technique, we can readily distinguish the fingerprint of Flos Carthami from that of Stigma Croci, a possible substitute in traditional Chinese medicine, and Flos Hemerocallis, a commercial adulterant. A method based on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is described to establish fingerprints of Flos Carthami simultaneously. The fingerprints obtained with HPLC consist of 21 common peaks within 65 min while 43 common peaks obtained with CEC. CEC showed better performance on fingerprinting of hydroxysaffloryellow A and its neighboring peaks, which contained more chemical information than that of HPLC. It was proven that CEC could be a feasible and effective method for development of fingerprint of TCM based on the comparison with HPLC. © 2006 Friedr. Vieweg & Sohn Verlag/GWV Fachverlage GmbH.

38049031553	Application of metabolomics in research of plant metabolites	Metabolomics, a branch of systems biology, has gained extensive attention and profound achievements in the plant. Although plant metabolomics is to be explored, it has been one of the most effective methods to study the physiological and biochemical process and gene modification in pattern plants. We herein summarized the concept, development, and application of metabolomics and prospected the potentials in the metabolite profiling for plant. Metabolomics provides an omics' methodology to elucidate the whole biological process, identify and quantify the complex components in the plant. A number of metabolites present in the plant are active components of traditional Chinese medicine, and these bioactive components are influenced by the multi-factors such as environment, species, and processing methods etc. Therefore, it is of great importance to analyze a wide spectrum of compositions with diverse chemical characteristics and varied concentration, which is the foundation to quality control, allowing the elucidation of the pharmacological effectiveness, and further exploiting of traditional Chinese medicine.

34248139693	Pharmacometabonomic phenotyping reveals different responses to xenobiotic intervention in rats	In conventional pharmacological studies, intersubject differences within an animal strain are normally neglected, leading to variations in pharmacological outcomes in response to the same stimulus. Using two classical experimental models, the Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic model of Wistar rats and the high-energy, diet-induced obesity model of Sprague-Dawley rats, we demonstrate that the different outcomes of STZ or diet intervention are closely associated with variation in predose (baseline) urinary metabolic profiles of the rats. The pharmacometabonomic analysis of predose metabolic profiles indicates that the intersubject difference is, to a great extent, associated with gut-microbiota, which predisposes different pathophysiological outcomes upon diet alteration or chemical stimulus. We hypothesize that there may exist an important association between observations from these two models and the obese/diabetic human population in that subtle variations in metabolic phenotype may predetermine different systems' responses to xenobiotic perturbation, ultimately leading to varied pathophysiological processes. Results from two independent models also suggest that the pharmacometabonomics approach is of great importance in the study of pharmacology and clinical drug evaluations, where endogenous metabolite signatures of predose individuals should be taken into consideration to minimize intersubject difference and the resulting variation in the postdose pharmacological outcomes. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

80052272696	Salivary metabolite signatures of oral cancer and leukoplakia	Oral cancer, one of the six most common human cancers with an overall 5-year survival rate of <50%, is often not diagnosed until it has reached an advanced stage. The aim of the current study is to explore salivary metabolomics as a disease diagnostic and stratification tool for oral cancer and leukoplakia and evaluate the potential of salivary metabolome for detection of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Saliva metabolite profiling for a group of 37 OSCC patients, 32 oral leukoplakia (OLK) patients and 34 healthy subjects was performed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry in conjunction with multivariate statistical analysis. The OSCC, OLK and healthy control groups demonstrate characteristic salivary metabolic signatures. A panel of five salivary metabolites including γ-aminobutyric acid, phenylalanine, valine, n-eicosanoic acid and lactic acid were selected using OPLS-DA model with S-plot. The predictive power of each of the five salivary metabolites was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves for OSCC. Valine, lactic acid and phenylalanine in combination yielded satisfactory accuracy (0.89, 0.97), sensitivity (86.5% and 94.6%), specificity (82.4% and 84.4%) and positive predictive value (81.6% and 87.5%) in distinguishing OSCC from the controls or OLK, respectively. The utility of salivary metabolome diagnostics for oral cancer is successfully demonstrated in this study and these results suggest that metabolomics approach complements the clinical detection of OSCC and stratifies the two types of lesions, leading to an improved disease diagnosis and prognosis. © 2011 UICC.

84861833418	Metabolic fate of tea polyphenols in humans	Polyphenols, a ubiquitous group of secondary plant metabolites sharing at least one aromatic ring structure with one or more hydroxyl groups, represent a large group of natural antioxidants abundant in fruits, vegetables, and beverages, such as grape juice, wine, and tea, and are widely considered to contribute to health benefits in humans. However, little is yet known concerning their bioactive forms in vivo and the mechanisms by which they may alter our metabolome, which ultimately contribute toward disease prevention. Here we report a study to determine the metabolic fate of polyphenolic components in a Chinese tea (Pu-erh) in human subjects using a metabonomic profiling approach coupled with multivariate and univariate statistical analysis. Urine samples were collected at 0 h, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h, and 24 h within the first 24 h and once a day during a 6 week period including a 2 week baseline phase, a 2 week daily Pu-erh tea ingestion phase, and a 2 week "wash-out" phase, and they were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The dynamic concentration profile of bioavailable plant molecules (due to in vivo absorption and the hepatic and gut bacterial metabolism) and the human metabolic response profile were measured and correlated with each other. This study demonstrates that the metabonomic strategy will enable us to integrate the overwhelming amount of metabolic end points as a systems' response to the absorption, metabolism, and disposition of a multicomponent botanical intervention system, leading to a direct elucidation of their mechanisms of action. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84867453251	Transcriptomic and metabonomic profiling reveal synergistic effects of quercetin and resveratrol supplementation in high fat diet fed mice	Dietary quercetin and resveratrol have been frequently used in treating various diseases, but the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Here, we report combined transcriptomic and metabonomic profiling that showed that the combined supplementation with quercetin and resveratrol produced synergistic effects on a high-fat diet-induced metabolic phenotype in mice. Histological and phenotypic improvements in serum and hepatic total cholesterol, insulin, fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c were also observed in mice receiving combined quercetin and resveratrol supplementation. This combined quercetin and resveratrol supplementation resulted in significant restoration of gene sets in functional pathways of glucose/lipid metabolism, liver function, cardiovascular system, and inflammation/immunity, which were altered by high fat diet feeding. The integration of transcriptomic and metabonomic data indicated quercetin and resveratrol supplementation enhanced processes of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, as well as suppressed gluconeogenesis. These alterations discovered at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels highlight the significance of combined "omics" platforms for elucidating mechanistic pathways altered by dietary polyphenols, such as quercetin and resveratrol, in a synergistic manner. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

Higher concentrations of ADMA in blood have been observed in patients with metabolic diseases and certain cancers. However, the role of ADMA in colon cancer has not been well investigated. ADMA serum levels in human patients diagnosed with colon cancer were found to be higher than those present in healthy subjects. ADMA treatment of LoVo cells, a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, attenuated serum starvation-induced apoptosis and suppressed the activation of the Fas (APO-1/CD95)/JNK (SAPK) (c-Jun N terminal protein kinase/stress-activated protein kinase)pathway.

84896958739	The in vivo and in vitro study of polysaccharides from a two-herb formula on ulcerative colitis and potential mechanism of action	Ethnopharmacological relevance Lycium barbarum and Astragalus membranaceus are two traditional medicinal herbs widely used in China for nourishing Yin and reinforcing Qi. The purpose of the study was to investigate the prophylactic and curative effects of crude polysaccharides (QHPS) extracted from a two-herb formula composed of Lycium barbarum and Astragalus membranaceus at a ratio of 2:3 in colitis rats, and to further elucidate the potential mechanism of action in epithelial cell proliferation in vitro. Materials and methods An acetic acid (AA)-induced ulcerative colitis rat model was applied in the study. Two independent protocols were used to assess the prophylactic and curative effects of QHPS, respectively, in which rats were either pre-treated with QHPS (0.18 g/kg) for 14 days prior to AA induction, or post-treated with QHPS for 7 days after AA induction. The stool consistency and weight loss were used to evaluate disease activity. The morphological changes in intestinal mucosa at the end of the experiments were observed. The serum levels of endotoxin (EDT), diamine oxidase (DAO) and d-lactate (DLA), important biochemical markers for evaluating intestinal mucosal structure and function, were measured. In the in vitro mechanistic studies, rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) were used to access for epithelium regeneration. Results The intra-colonic instillation of AA induced ulcerative colitis in rat, as indicated by diarrhea, weight loss, and colonic mucosal damage. Both prophylactic and curative treatments effectively reduced the weight loss and diarrhea and attenuated the colonic mucosal damage associated with inducible colitis. The significant increase in serum levels of DAO, DLA and EDT was induced by AA and inhibited by QHPS treatment. Moreover, QHPS could significantly stimulate IEC-6 proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). Conclusion The present study indicated for the first time that polysaccharides extracted from this two-herb formula can protect against experimental ulcerative colitis, presumably by promoting the recovery of the intestinal barrier. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

51649123674	Application of ultra-performance LC-TOF MS metabolite profiling techniques to the analysis of medicinal Panax herbs	The morphological appearance and some ingredients of Panax ginseng, Panax notoginseng and Panax japonicus of the Panax genus are similar. However, their pharmacological activities are obviously different due to the significant differences in the types and quantity of saponins in each herb. In the present study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS) was used to profile the abundances of metabolites in the three medicinal Panax herbs. Multivariate statistical analysis technique, that is, principle component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used to discriminate between the Panax samples. PCA of the analytical data showed a clear separation of compositions among the three medicinal herbs. The critical markers such as chikusetsusaponin IVa, ginsenoside R0, ginsenoside Rc, ginsenoside Rb1, ginsenoside Rb2 and ginsenoside Rg2 accountable for such variations were identified through the corresponding loading weights, and the tentative identification of biomarkers is completed by the accurate mass of TOFMS and high resolution and high retention time reproducibility performed by UPLC. The proposed analytical method coupled with multivariate statistical analysis is reliable to analyze a group of metabolites present in the herbal extracts and other natural products. This method can be further utilized to evaluate chemical components obtained from different plants and/or the plants of different geographical locations, thereby classifying the medicinal plant resources and potentially elucidating the mechanism of inherent phytochemical diversity. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.

Method: We used ethyl chloroformate derivatization and gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabonomic method to analyze rat urines. Result: The time-dependent variations of metabolite profile showed a progressive deviation of the metabolism in die model group from the initial pattern over time and a systemic recovery of the metabolism in the treatment group, which is consistent with the histological results. The in-depth analysis indicated that the disorder of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), tryptophan metabolism, polyamine metabolism and gut flora structure were associated with DMH intervention. Conclusion: Metabolic study revealed that Jinfu Kang can effectively reverse metabolic departures in DMH-induced precancerous colon rat, which is consistent with pathological results.

56749097907	Anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects of acidic fraction of Pheratima extract in asthma mice induced by ovalbumin	Objective: To explore the effects of acidic fraction of Pheratima extract in an ovalbumin (OVA) induced asthma mouse model, and to provide the experimental evidences for the anti-asthmatic application of Pheratima extract with further purification and development. Method: Mice model of allergic asthma was established through the OVA challenge. To investigate the inflammatory cell level and Th1/Th2 levels as well as the therapeutic effects of acidic fraction from Pheratima extract, cell count of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was performed to evaluate the secretion of eosinophils (EOS) cells, and IgE, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IFN-γ levels were detected by ELISA. Result: Compared with control group, the EOS count of BALF in the model group was remarkably increased (P < 0.01), and IgE, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 levels were also increased (P < 0.01), while IFN-γ decreased (P < 0.01). Acidic fraction from Pheratima (S) extract and its 30% ethanol washed fraction (S30) significantly inhibited the increase of EOS count (P < 0.01), decreased the IgE, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 levels (P < 0.05), and inhibited the decrease of IFN-γ level (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The results indicate that inhibition of the EOS secretion and balancing of the altered Th1/Th2 levels may be important mechanisms of Pheratima's therapeutic effect in asthmatic mice model, and S30 is pharmacologically effective as evaluated with the above mentioned parameters, as a representative fraction of the Pheratima extract.

Differences in tea processing resulted in differences in the chemical constituents and the color of tea infusions. Human biological responses to pu-erh tea ingestion were also studied by using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS) in conjunction with multivariate statistical techniques. Metabolic alterations during and after pu-erh tea ingestion were characterized by increased urinary excretion of 5-hydroxytryptophan, inositol, and 4-methoxyphenylacetic acid, along with reduced excretion of 3-chlorotyrosine and creatinine. This study highlights the potential for metabonomic technology to assess nutritional interventions and is an important step toward a full understanding of pu-erh tea and its influence on human metabolism. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

66749153176	Metabonomics approach to understanding acute and chronic stress in rat models	The effects of acute and chronic stress on the production of systemic metabolites were investigated in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Metabolites excreted in urine were analyzed using GC/MS in conjunction with multivariate and univariate statistical techniques. SD rats were subjected to two kinds of acute stress and chronic unpredictable mild stress, respectively. Metabolic analysis demonstrated that urinary expression of a number of metabolites including glutamate, glutamine, homovanillate, proline, succinate, citrate, and tyrosine altered in the acute stress model in the same way as in the chronic model, while pimelate and hippurate changed in the opposite trend. The results suggested that the stress induced metabolic perturbations were reversible and nonspecific. Metabolic response to chronic combined stress revealed biochemical clues to depression-like symptoms validated by behavior and physiologic results. This study provides a noninvasive and dynamic analytical strategy for the characterization of endogenous metabolic perturbations induced by external stress. © 2009 American Chemical Society. .

66149121844	Trace element profiling using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and its application in an osteoarthritis study	In this study, a novel method of quantitatively measuring serum trace elements using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analysis was developed and applied successfully to the study of osteoarthritis (OA). This technology provides potential advantages over conventional targeted elemental analysis in that it achieves high throughput measurement, small sample volume, and simple operational procedure. Such an unbiased method is particularly suitable for large scale discovery research on trace element based biomarkers. The method optimization and validation study involved accuracy and perturbation testing which focused on estimating the ability of the method to resist interferences in ICP-MS analysis, particularly those of mass <82 amu, in the serum sample. The developed method was successfully applied to the study of serum samples from OA patients. As a result, the serum trace element profiles of OA patients were distinctively separated from those of the healthy controls (HC) using an Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLSDA) model. Additionally, significantly differential elements correlated with OA, such as Li and Sn, were identified as potential elemental-based biomarkers. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

69749117578	Traditional Chinese medicine: Balancing the gut ecosystem	Gut microflora has become a topic of interest in life sciences in the context of global systems biology, in which human biological system is viewed as 'superorganisms' involving an internal ecosystem of diverse microbiome. We conceive that multi-pathway modulations of the human gut microbial system exerted by traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) to restore the balance of the gut ecology may account for a large portion of their effectiveness in host during treatment. Such a concept is evidenced by series of studies which have revealed an interactive relationship between gut microflora and TCM, involving the two important aspects: gut microflora-dependent drug metabolism in TCM and gut microflora-targeted modulation of physiological conditions, both of which highlight the significance of gut microflora involvement in the future TCM investigation.

We have performed a serum metabolic analysis to test the hypothesis that the distinct metabolite profiles of malignant tumors are reflected in biofluids. In this study, we have analyzed the serum metabolites from 64 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and 65 healthy controls using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and Acquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Acquity UPLC-QTOFMS). Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) models generated from GC-TOFMS and UPLC-QTOFMS metabolic profile data showed robust discrimination from CRC patients and healthy controls. A total of 33 differential metabolites were identified using these two analytical platforms, five of which were detected in both instruments. These metabolites potentially reveal perturbation of glycolysis, arginine and proline metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and oleamide metabolism, associated with CRC morbidity. These results suggest that serum metabolic profiling has great potential in detecting CRC and helping to understand its underlying mechanisms. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

73649128909	Metabonomic evaluation of melamine-induced acute renal toxicity in rats	The recent outbreak of renal failure in infants in China has been determined to be caused by melamine (Mel) and derivatives adulterated in the food. A metabonomic study was performed to evaluate the global biochemical alteration triggered by Mel ingestion in parallel with the acute renal toxicity in rats. Mel at 600, 300, and 100 mg/kg, cyanuric acid (Cya) at 100 mg/kg, and mixture of Mel and Cya (50 mg/kg each) were administered in five groups of Wistar rats, respectively, via oral gavage for 15 days. Urinary metabonomic profiles indicated that Mel perturbed urinary metabolism in a dose-dependent manner, with high-dose group showing the most significant impact. Metabonomic variations also suggest that the toxicity of low-dose (50 mg/kg) Mel was greatly elevated by the presence of Cya (at 50 mg/kg), which was able to induce a significant metabolic alteration to a level equivalent to that of 600 mg/kg Mel. Histological examination and serum biochemical analysis also indicated that the low-dose Mel-Cya mixture and high-dose Mel group resulted in the greatest renal toxicity. The high-dose Mel and low-dose Mel-Cya resulted in disrupted amino acid metabolism including tryptophan, polyamine, and tyrosine metabolism, and altered TCA and gut microflora structure. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77949822339	Urinary metabonomic study on colorectal cancer	After our serum metabonomic study of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients recently published in J. Proteome Res., we profiled urine metabolites from the same group of CRC patients (before and after surgical operation) and 63 age-matched healthy volunteers using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in conjunction with a multivariate statistics technique. A parallel metabonomic study on a 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)treated Sprague-Dawley rat model was also performed to identify significantly altered metabolites associated with chemically induced precancerous colorectal lesion. The orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models of metabonomic results demonstrated good separations between CRC patients or DMH-induced model rats and their healthy counterparts. The significantly increased tryptophan metabolism, and disturbed tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the gut microflora metabolism were observed in both the CRC patients and the rat model, The urinary metabolite profile of postoperative CRC subjects altered significantly from that of the preoperative stage. The significantly down-regulated gut microflora metabolism and TCA cycle were observed in postoperative CRC subjects, presumably due to the colon flush involved in the surgical procedure and weakened physical conditions of the patients. The expression of 5-hydroxytryptophan significantly decreased in postsurgery samples, suggesting a recovered tryptophan metabolism toward healthy state. Abnormal histamine metabolism and glutamate metabolism were found only in the urine samples of CRC patients, and the abnormal polyamine metabolism was found only in the rat urine. This study assessed the important metabonomic variations in urine associated with CRC and, therefore, pro-vided baseline information complementary to serum/ plasma and tissue metabonomics for the complete elucidation of the underlying metabolic mechanisms of CRC. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

Metabolite extractions were carried out using three solvents: chloroform, methanol, and water, with design of experiment (DOE) theory and multivariate statistical analysis. A two-step metabolite extraction procedure was optimized using a mixed solvent of chloroform-methanol-water (1:2:1, v/v/v) and then followed by methanol alone. This approach was subsequently validated using standard compounds and liver tissues. Calibration curves were obtained in the range of 0.50-125.0μg/mL for standards and 0.02-0.25 g/mL acceptable for liver tissue samples. For most of the metabolites investigated, relative standard deviations (RSD) were below 10% within a day (reproducibility) and below 15% within a week (stability). Rat liver tissues of carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver injury models (n=. 10) and healthy control rats (n=. 10) were analyzed which demonstrated the applicability of the developed procedure for the tissue metabonomic study. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77956308261	Serum and urinary metabonomic study of human osteosarcoma	Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor found in children. Currently, researchers have focused on protein and gene levels, while the associated metabolic variations have been poorly understood. In this study, we used a gas chromatography mass spectrometry approach and profiled small-molecule metabolites in serum and urine of 24 OS patients, 19 benign bone tumor patients, and 32 healthy controls, to determine whether there are significant alterations associated with carcinogenesis. The metabonomic results demonstrate clear intergroup separations between healthy control subjects and bone tumor patients in the orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models. Differential metabolites identified from the metabonomic analysis suggest a disrupted energy metabolism in OS patients, as characterized by significantly down-regulated TCA cycle and glycolysis, down-regulated lipid metabolism, dysregulated sugar levels, and up-regulated amino acid metabolism. Additionally, an increased activity of glutathione metabolism, and increased polyamine metabolism also contributed to a characteristic metabolic signature of OS patients. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

Besides conventional PCA, PLS and OPLS approaches, more and more machine learning classifiers are likely to become the supplements for metabolic profiling data analysis. A comprehensive comparison of PLS, support vector machine (SVM, with linear and quadratic kernels), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and random forest (RF) was reported applying on clinical metabonomics data. The accuracy of these classifiers was tested by 7-fold and holdout Cross Validation. Their stability and over fitting were evaluated by holdout Cross Validation and permutation (repeated 100 times). Their prediction ability was investigated by ROC curve, and their sensitivity on irrelevant variables was studied by variable ranking combining selection step by step. The overall performance of RF and SVM (linear kernel) is superior to the others. Some selected variables are of significance for further research on metabolic difference. ©2010 IEEE.

We report an ultrasonication-assisted protocol which reduces the derivatization time from hours to about 30 min and significantly enhances the derivatization efficiency prior to a GC/TOFMS analysis. The protocol was evaluated using 40 compounds representing different classes of human metabolites, and demonstrated good analytical precision and accuracy. In comparison with the conventional method, the new protocol was able to increase the intensity of most of the identified peaks (71.0%) in the GC/TOFMS chromatograms of human serum samples. The detected compounds with increased intensity include most amino acids, keto-containing organic acids, carbonyl-containing carbohydrates, and unsaturated fatty acids. We applied this protocol in a metabolomic study of human serum samples obtained from 34 patients diagnosed with hypertension and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. Metabolite markers associated with hypertension, including glucosamine, d-sorbitol, 1-stearoylglycerol, and homocysteine, were identified and validated by statistical methods and use of reference standards. Our work highlights the potential of this novel approach for the large-scale metabolite profiling of samples generated from plant, animal, and clinical and epidemiological studies. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

79956144004	Metabolite profiling of hemodialysate using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry	Hemodialysis is an important alternative for renal replacement therapy to remove uremic retention solutes (URS) for the uremic syndrome. The metabolites in the hemodialysate directly reflect the efficiency of URS clearance. Here we report a highly sensitive and reliable metabolomic procedure for the measurement of small molecule metabolites in hemodialysate using gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOF/MS). The method was developed and evaluated through orthogonal experimental design using multivariate statistical analysis. The optimized method involves the use of methanol and water in the ratio of 3:1 (v/v) for dissolving the lyophilized solid of the hemodialysate after degradation of urea with urease (no less than 50. U) for 10. min. Validation of the method demonstrated a good linearity with regression coefficients greater than 0.99. Relative standard deviations of precision and stability of proposed method were less than 15%, and recoveries ranged from 71.8 to 115.8%. This method was successfully applied in the metabolite profiling of human hemodialysate samples which was able to differentiate the patients treated with high-flux hemodialysis from those with low-flux hemodialysis. The metabolomic results reveal a higher concentration of URS, and thus, better URS removal, from the patients under high-flux dialysis than those under low-flux dialysis. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79961241845	Dynamic metabolic transformation in tumor invasion and metastasis in mice with LM-8 osteosarcoma cell transplantation	While extensive evidence indicates that tumor cells shift their global metabolic programs, the molecular details of the metabolic transformation in tumor invasion, progression, and metastasis remain largely unknown. Characterization of the time-dependent metabolic shift during the tumor invasion, development, and metastasis will describe an important aspect of tumor phenotypes and potentially allow us to design therapies that inhibit tumor cell movement. In this study, a metabonomic study was performed to characterize the global metabolic changes during the process of tumor invasion and metastasis to lung in a mouse model with subcutaneous transplantation of murine osteosarcoma cell line (LM8). The serum metabolic profiling revealed that many key metabolites in glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as well as most of the amino acids were elevated at rapidly growing stage of tumor, presumably resulting from a high energy demand and turnover of anabolic metabolism during the tumor cell proliferation. Serum levels of succinic acid and proline significantly increased (with fold change FC = 10.75 and 4.43, relative to controls) among all the metabolites in the third week. The serum metabolic profile of lung metastasis at week 4 was different from that at week 3, in that most of previously increased serum metabolites were found decreased, except for cholesterol and several free fatty acids, suggesting lowered carbohydrate and amino acids metabolism, but an elevated lipid metabolism associated with tumor metastasis. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

80051664076	GC/MS-based urinary metabolomics reveals systematic differences in metabolism and ethanol response between Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats	Metabolic differences of experimental animals contribute to pharmacological variations. Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar rats are commonly used experimental rats with similar genetic background, and considered interchangeable in practical researches. In this study, we present the urinary metabolomics results, based on gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS), which reveal the systematic metabolic differences between SD and Wistar rats under different perturbations such as fasting, feeding, and consecutive acute ethanol interventions. The different metabotypes between the two strains of rats involve a number of metabolic pathways and symbiotic gut microflora. SD rats exhibited higher individualized metabolic variations in the fasting and feeding states, and a stronger ability to recover from an altered metabolic profile with less hepatic injury from the consecutive ethanol exposure, as compared to Wistar rats. In summary, the GC/MS-based urinary metabolomics studies demonstrated an intrinsic metabolic difference between SD and Wistar rats, which warrants consideration in experimental design using these animal strains. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

80053920356	Metabolic signature of pregnant women with neural tube defects in offspring	Neural tube defects (NTDs) are one of the most common types of birth defects, affecting approximately 1 of every 1000 pregnancies in the United States and an estimated 300 000 newborns worldwide each year. The metabolic signature of pregnant women with NTDs in offspring has not previously been characterized. In this paper, we report a profiling study that characterized the serum metabolome of 101 pregnant women affected with NTDs in offspring in comparison with 143 pregnant women with normal pregnancy outcomes in Lvliang prefecture, the area with the highest birth prevalence of NTDs in China. A serum metabonomic study was also conducted to identify significantly altered metabolites associated with di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP)-induced teratogenesis in mice. The metabolic signature of NTD in pregnant women is characterized by the impaired mitochondrial respiration, neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid, and methionine cycle. Of interest, consistent findings from DBP-induced teratogenesis in mice demonstrated increased succinate and decreased fumarate, suggesting an inhibited succinic dehydrogenase implicated in the defective mitochondria. The characteristic disruption of maternal metabolism offers important insights into metabolic mechanisms underlying human NTDs as well as potential preventive strategies. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

80054051929	Metabolomic evaluation of di-n-butyl phthalate-induced teratogenesis in mice	Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) has been linked to the neural, reproductive and developmental toxicity. We present here a metabolomic study that characterized the metabolic variations associated with the DBP-induced teratogenesis in maternal and fetal mice. DBP at 50 and 300 mg/kg were administrated to pregnant C57 mice, via gastric intubation on gestation day 7-9, respectively. Maternal mice were euthanized on gestation day 16 and examined for fetal development and malformations. Metabolomic study of maternal serum, placenta and fetal brain tissues was performed using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with multivariate data analysis (MVDA). The results showed that a 50 mg/kg dose of DBP had no significant effect on fetal development and a 300 mg/kg dose caused embryo resorption and fetal malformations (primarily eye abnormalities and encephalocele). MVDA indicated that DBP at two doses gave rise to disruption of maternal and fetal metabolic profiles characterized by significantly altered tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid, purine and lipid metabolism. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

81755173050	Metabonomic phenotyping reveals an embryotoxicity of deca-brominated diphenyl ether in mice	Recent studies have demonstrated that polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial chemicals, could disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis and exhibit neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and embryotoxicity. However, clear evidence of embryotoxicity and neurotoxicity of many of these congeners, such as deca-BDE, one of the least bioactive congeners of PBDEs, is still lacking. In the present study, we investigated deca-BDE embryotoxicity by quantitative analysis of two essential thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) and a variety of small-molecule metabolites in the serum of deca-BDE-dosed pregnant mice. Four groups of pregnant C57 mice were administrated with deca-BDE in 20% fat emulsion at a dose of 150, 750, 1500, or 2500 mg/kg body weight via gastric intubation on gestation days (g.d.s) 7 to 9, while a control group was given 20% fat emulsion. Maternal mice were euthanized on g.d. 16 and examined for external malformations of the fetus. Maternal serum samples were collected and analyzed by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS). Using multivariate statistical analysis, we observed a significantly altered metabolic profile associated with deca-BDE embryotoxicity in maternal serum. Our results also demonstrated that deca-BDE at a dose of 2500 mg/kg body weight induced significant disruption of thyroid hormone metabolism, the TCA cycle, and lipid metabolism in maternal mice, which subsequently led to a significant inhibition of fetal growth and development. We concluded that deca-BDE-induced embryotoxicity closely correlated with global metabolic disruption that can be characterized by thyroid hormone deficiency, disrupted lipid metabolism, and a depleted level of cholesterol in maternal mice. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

82755184864	The footprints of gut microbial-mammalian co-metabolism	Gut microbiota are associated with essential various biological functions in humans through a "network" of microbial-host co-metabolism to process nutrients and drugs and modulate the activities of multiple pathways in organ systems that are linked to different diseases. The microbiome impacts strongly on the metabolic phenotypes of the host, and hence, metabolic readouts can give insights into functional metagenomic activity. We applied an untargeted mass spectrometry (MS) based metabonomics approach to profile normal Wistar rats exposed to a broad spectrum β-lactam antibiotic imipenem/cilastatin sodium, at 50 mg/kg/daily for 4 days followed by a 14-day recovery period. In-depth metabolic phenotyping allowed identification of a panel of 202 urinary and 223 fecal metabolites significantly related to end points of a functional metagenome (p < 0.05 in at least one day), many of which have not been previously reported such as oligopeptides and carbohydrates. This study shows extensive gut microbiota modulation of host systemic metabolism involving short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan, tyrosine metabolism, and possibly a compensatory mechanism of indole-melatonin production. Given the integral nature of the mammalian genome and metagenome, this panel of metabolites will provide a new platform for potential therapeutic markers and mechanistic solutions to complex problems commonly encountered in pathology, toxicology, or drug metabolism studies. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84857789813	Urine metabolite profiling offers potential early diagnosis of oral cancer	Oral cancer is the sixth most common human cancer, with a high morbidity rate and an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 50%. It is often not diagnosed until it has reached an advanced stage. Therefore, an early diagnostic and stratification strategy is of great importance for oral cancer. In the current study, urine samples of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC, n = 37), oral leukoplakia (OLK, n = 32) and healthy subjects (n = 34) were analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS). Using multivariate statistical analysis, the urinary metabolite profiles of OSCC, OLK and healthy control samples can be clearly discriminated and a panel of differentially expressed metabolites was obtained. Metabolites, valine and 6-hydroxynicotic acid, in combination yielded an accuracy of 98.9%, sensitivity of 94.4%, specificity of 91.4%, and positive predictive value of 91.9% in distinguishing OSCC from the controls. The combination of three differential metabolites, 6-hydroxynicotic acid, cysteine, and tyrosine, was able to discriminate between OSCC and OLK with an accuracy of 92.7%, sensitivity of 85.0%, specificity of 89.7%, and positive predictive value of 91.9%. This study demonstrated that the metabolite markers derived from this urinary metabolite profiling approach may hold promise as a diagnostic tool for early stage OSCC and its differentiation from other oral conditions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84859138219	Use of the metabolomics approach to characterize chinese medicinal material Huangqi	Integration of the genetic and metabolic fingerprinting can provide a new approach to differentiate similar Traditional Chinese Medical (TCM) materials. Two leguminous plants, Mojia Huangqi and Menggu Huangqi, are important medical herbs and share great similarities in morphology, chemical constituent, and genomic DNA sequence. The taxonomy of Mojia Huangqi and Menggu Huangqi has been debated for more than 50years and discrimination of TCM materials directly affects the pharmacological and clinical effects. AFLP based genetic fingerprinting and GC-TOF/MS-based metabolic fingerprinting were used to successfully discriminate the two species. The results of AFLP supported the opinion that Menggu Huangqi was a variant of Mojia Huangqi. The metabolic fingerprinting showed growth locations have greater impacts on the metabolite composition and quantity than the genotypes (cultivated versus wild) in Menggu Huangqi. The difference of some soluble sugars, fatty acids, proline, and polyamine reflected plant adaptation to different growth environments. Using multivariate and univariate statistical analysis, three AFLP markers and eight metabolites were identified as candidate DNA and metabolic markers to distinguish the two herb materials. The correlation network between AFLP markers and metabolites revealed a complex correlation network, which indicated the special metabolic pathways and the regulation networks of Huangqi. © 2011 The Author Published by the Molecular Plant Shanghai Editorial Office in association with Oxford University Press on behalf of CSPB and IPPE, SIBS, CAS.

84860912886	Metabolic profiling research of primary liver tumor based on multiple discriminant analysis	Objective: To compare the diagnosis performance of discriminant analysis methods through application on clinical serum samples. Methods: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and logistic discriminant analysis (LogDA) were applied to metabolic profiling analysis deriving from clinical serum samples of 109 healthy controls, 87 patients with benign liver tumor and 31 patients with malignant liver tumor. The diagnosis performance of these three methods was compared in discrimination of healthy controls and patients with liver tumor(benign tumor and malignant tumor) and in discrimination of patients with benign tumor and those with malignant tumor. Results: Based on current clinical metabolic profiling data, the effectiveness of all these three methods worked better in discrimination of healthy controls and patients with liver tumor than in discrimination of patients with benign tumor and those with malignant tumor. The overall performance of QDA was superior to LDA and LogDA, with the precision of 87.67% in discrimination of healthy controls and patients with liver tumor and the precision of 67.80% in discrimination of patients with benign tumor and those with malignant tumor. Conclusion: QDA outperforms LDA and LogDA in processing primary liver tumor metabolic data.

84863024905	Distinct urinary metabolic profile of human colorectal cancer	A full spectrum of metabolic aberrations that are directly linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) at early curable stages is critical for developing and deploying molecular diagnostic and therapeutic approaches that will significantly improve patient survival. We have recently reported a urinary metabonomic profiling study on CRC subjects (n = 60) and health controls (n = 63), in which a panel of urinary metabolite markers was identified. Here, we report a second urinary metabonomic study on a larger cohort of CRC (n = 101) and healthy subjects (n = 103), using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Consistent with our previous findings, we observed a number of dysregulated metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, TCA cycle, urea cycle, pyrimidine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, polyamine metabolism, as well as gut microbial-host co-metabolism in CRC subjects. Our findings confirm distinct urinary metabolic footprints of CRC patients characterized by altered levels of metabolites derived from gut microbial-host co-metabolism. A panel of metabolite markers composed of citrate, hippurate, p-cresol, 2-aminobutyrate, myristate, putrescine, and kynurenate was selected, which was able to discriminate CRC subjects from their healthy counterparts. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis of these markers resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.993 and 0.998 for the training set and the testing set, respectively. These potential metabolite markers provide a novel and promising molecular diagnostic approach for the early detection of CRC. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84862963570	Urinary metabolite markers of precocious puberty	The incidence of precocious puberty (PP, the appearance of signs of pubertal development at an abnormally early age), is rapidly rising, concurrent with changes of diet, lifestyles, and social environment. The current diagnostic methods are based on a hormone (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) stimulation test, which is costly, time-consuming, and uncomfortable for patients. The lack of molecular biomarkers to support simple laboratory tests, such as a blood or urine test, has been a long standing bottleneck in the clinical diagnosis and evaluation of PP. Here we report a metabolomic study using an ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry. Urine metabolites from 163 individuals were profiled, and the metabolic alterations were analyzed after treatment of central precocious puberty (CPP) with triptorelin depot. A panel of biomarkers selected from >70 differentially expressed urinary metabolites by receiver operating characteristic and logistic regression analysis provided excellent predictive power with high sensitivity and specificity for PP. The altered metabolic profile of the PP patients was characterized by three major perturbed metabolic pathways: catecholamine, serotonin metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid cycle, presumably resulting from activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Treatment with triptorelin depot was able to normalize these three altered pathways. Additionally, significant changes in the urine levels of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, indoleacetic acid, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and 5-hydroxykynurenamine in the CPP group suggest that the development of CPP condition may involve an alteration in symbiotic gut microbial composition. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84863273758	Human gouty arthritis is associated with a distinct serum trace elemental profile	Homeostatic imbalance of essential trace elements is deeply involved in many pathophysiological states, especially in joint disorders such as gout. A total of 64 elements were measured in the serum samples in three regionally independent groups of patients with gouty arthritis (n = 100) and an age-matched healthy control group (n = 40) by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A distinct elemental profile of gouty arthritis encompassing significantly altered Li, Al, Ti, Fe, Cu, Se, Sr, Ta, Hg, Bi, Th, and U was obtained with a sensitivity of 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.92-0.99) and a specificity of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.83-0.99) for gout diagnosis. An independent group of 52 subjects (39 gout patients and 13 healthy controls) was further used to validate the elemental signature, yielding a sensitivity of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.91-1.00) and a specificity of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.75-1.00) for gout prediction. It is also noteworthy that we were able to achieve ≥95.7% correct classification rate in both discovery and validation groups using only three elemental markers, Li, Al, and U. We also observed a good correlation between Li, Zn, and Cu and the other two risk factors, age and serum urate concentration, in gout patients. Our findings underscore that gouty arthritis possesses a unique elemental expression profile regardless of many other nutritional and environmental factors. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84866133036	Serum metabolic signatures of fulminant type 1 diabetes	Fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1DM) is a relatively new clinical entity featured by acute destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Clinical consequences of FT1DM could be fatal when timely medications are not provided, suggesting the particular importance of rapid and accurate diagnosis. Here we report a serum metabonomics study of FT1DM patients, together with healthy control subjects (NC), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), classic type 1 diabetes (T1DM), and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) patients, with the aim of discovering metabolic markers associated with FT1DM. A total of 79 subjects were enrolled (22 NC, 22 T1DM, 22 T2DM, 8 DKA and 5 FT1DM) and the serum metabolic profiling of fasting blood samples was performed using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) coupled with multivariate and univariate statistical analyses. Serum metabolites differentially expressed in FT1DM relative to NC, or to T2DM, T1DM and DKA were identified. Three metabolite markers, 5-oxoproline, glutamate, and homocysteine, were significantly altered among FT1DM, T2DM, T1DM, and DKA. In addition, the three metabolite markers, 5-oxoproline, glutamate, and homocysteine, presented similar patterns of distribution across groups. The results showed that the metabolic signatures of FT1DM identified in this study could be of potential clinical significance for the accurate diagnosis of FT1DM. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84866312948	The Metabolic Responses to Aerial Diffusion of Essential Oils	Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and affect a great number of people worldwide. Essential oils, take effects through inhalation or topical application, are believed to enhance physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Although clinical studies suggest that the use of essential oils may have therapeutic potential, evidence for the efficacy of essential oils in treating medical conditions remains poor, with a particular lack of studies employing rigorous analytical methods that capture its identifiable impact on human biology. Here, we report a comprehensive gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) based metabonomics study that reveals the aromas-induced metabolic changes and the anxiolytic effect of aromas in elevated plus maze (EPM) induced anxiety model rats. The significant alteration of metabolites in the EPM group was attenuated by aromas treatment, concurrent with the behavioral improvement with significantly increased open arms time and open arms entries. Brain tissue and urinary metabonomic analysis identified a number of altered metabolites in response to aromas intervention. These metabolic changes included the increased carbohydrates and lowered levels of neurotransmitters (tryptophan, serine, glycine, aspartate, tyrosine, cysteine, phenylalanine, hypotaurine, histidine, and asparagine), amino acids, and fatty acids in the brain. Elevated aspartate, carbohydrates (sucrose, maltose, fructose, and glucose), nucleosides and organic acids such as lactate and pyruvate were also observed in the urine. The EPM induced metabolic differences observed in urine or brain tissue was significantly reduced after 10 days of aroma inhalation, as noted with the loss of statistical significance on many of the metabolites in the aroma-EPM group. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the metabonomics approach can capture the subtle metabolic changes resulting from exposure to essential oils and provide the basis for pinpointing affected pathways in anxiety-related behavior, which will lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of anxiolytic effect of essential oils. © 2012 Wu et al.

Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups (the control group, GBE group, high-fat diet [HFD] group and HFD+GBE group). The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) was treated with GBE and its flavonoid ingredients. The fatty acid composition of the rat liver was analyzed with gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOFMS). Triglyceride contents of both the rat liver and HepG2 cells were measured by enzymatic colorimetric method. The expressions of fatty acid metabolism-related genes were analyzed with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein expression and enzymatic activity were subsequently measured. Results: In rat livers, GBE reduced the elevations of hepatic triglyceride contents caused by HFD and the increased hepatic fatty acids were differentially affected by GBE. Notably, the expression and total activity of the fatty acid β-oxidation rate-limiting enzyme, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1A), were also promoted with GBE ingestion. In HepG2 cells, GBE and its ingredients, quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin, could decrease the cellular triglyceride content and upregulate the expression and total activity of CPT1A, respectively. Conclusions: The triglyceride-lowering effect of GBE on the HFD rat liver is closely associated with the increased expression and activity of CPT1A, and the flavonoid ingredients are the major contributors of GBE. © 2012 The Authors.

84870878531	Metabonomics approach to assessing the modulatory effects of St John's Wort, ginsenosides, and clomipramine in experimental depression	The protective effects of St John's Wort extract (SJ), ginsenosides (GS), and clomipramine (CPM) on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression in rats were investigated by using a combination of behavioral assessments and metabonomics. Metabonomic analyses were performed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in conjunction with multivariate and univariate statistical analyses. During and at the end point of the chronic stress experiment, food consumption, body weight, adrenal gland, thymus and spleen indices, behavior scores, sucrose consumption, and stress hormone levels were measured. Changes in these parameters reflected characteristic phenotypes of depression in rats. Metabonomic analysis of serum, urine, and brain tissue revealed that CPM and SJ mainly attenuated the alteration of monoamine neurotransmitter metabolites, while GS affected both excitatory/inhibitory amino acids and monoamine neurotransmitter metabolites. GS also attenuated the stress-induced alterations in cerebrum and peripheral metabolites to a greater extent than CPM and SJ. These results provide important mechanistic insights into the protective effects of GS against CUMS-induced depression and metabolic dysfunction. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84871291341	Potential metabolite markers of schizophrenia	Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects 0.5-1% of the population worldwide. Current diagnostic methods are based on psychiatric interviews, which are subjective in nature. The lack of disease biomarkers to support objective laboratory tests has been a long-standing bottleneck in the clinical diagnosis and evaluation of schizophrenia. Here we report a global metabolic profiling study involving 112 schizophrenic patients and 110 healthy subjects, who were divided into a training set and a test set, designed to identify metabolite markers. A panel of serum markers consisting of glycerate, eicosenoic acid, β-hydroxybutyrate, pyruvate and cystine was identified as an effective diagnostic tool, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.945 in the training samples (62 patients and 62 controls) and 0.895 in the test samples (50 patients and 48 controls). Furthermore, a composite panel by the addition of urine β-hydroxybutyrate to the serum panel achieved a more satisfactory accuracy, which reached an AUC of 1 in both the training set and the test set. Multiple fatty acids and ketone bodies were found significantly (P0.01) elevated in both the serum and urine of patients, suggesting an upregulated fatty acid catabolism, presumably resulting from an insufficiency of glucose supply in the brains of schizophrenia patients. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84874048883	Melamine-induced renal toxicity is mediated by the gut microbiota	Melamine poisoning has become widely publicized after a recent occurrence of renal injury in infants and children exposed to melamine-tainted milk in China. This renal damage is believed to result from kidney stones formed from melamine and uric acid or from melamine and its cocrystallizing chemical derivative, cyanuric acid. However, the composition of the stones and the mechanism by which the stones are formed in the renal tubules are unknown. We report that cyanuric acid can be produced in the gut by microbial transformation of melamine and serves as an integral component of the kidney stones responsible for melamine-induced renal toxicity in rats. Melamine-induced toxicity in rats was attenuated, and melamine excretion decreased after antibiotic suppression of gut microbial activity. We further demonstrated that melamine is converted to cyanuric acid in vitro by bacteria cultured from normal rat feces; Klebsiella was subsequently identified in fecal samples by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. In culture, Klebsiella terrigena was shown to convert melamine to cyanuric acid directly. Rats colonized by K. terrigena showed exacerbated melamine-induced nephrotoxicity. Cyanuric acid was detected in the kidneys of rats administered melamine alone, and the concentration after Klebsiella colonization was increased. These findings suggest that the observed toxicity of melamine may be conditional on the exact composition and metabolic activities of the gut microbiota.

84874482071	Robust and high throughput UPLC-QTOFMS method for the global metabolic profiling study of human serum	A robust and high throughput method was developed based on ultra performance liquid chromato-graphy and quadruple/time-of-flight mass spectrometry(UPLC-QTOFMS) for performing global metabolic profiling analysis on a large batch of human serum. Proteins in serum samples were precipitated by organic solvents. Using 38 reference standards, we compared serum preparation methods for protein precipitation by different organic solvents. Different conditions for global metabolic profiling analysis were performed and optimized on UPLC-QTOFMS. We also assayed the reproducibility, precision and stability of the method of profiling. The results indicated that methanol/acetonitrile(volume ratio 1:9) could effectively and reproducibly precipitated human serum proteins, performing the best extracting effect on the assayed reference standards. At least four fold of pre-cold organic solvents coupled with vortex for 2 min, ultrasonic treatment for 1 min and stayed at -20°C for 10 min were the most optimal for the extracting effect and protein precipitation. The results, according to the reproducibility, precision and stability, showed that the method was satisfactory in global metabolic profiling analysis of human serum. Furthermore, reproducibility of the method verified by principal component analysis(PCA) was consistent with the coefficient of variation(CV) analysis in the results. The method was adapted to metabolomics study, especially the large batch metabolomics study, with a high throughput of over 100 samples a day(13 min for each sample run).

84874507532	Random forest in clinical metabolomics for phenotypic discrimination and biomarker selection	Metabolomic data analysis becomes increasingly challenging when dealing with clinical samples with diverse demographic and genetic backgrounds and various pathological conditions or treatments. Although many classification tools, such as projection to latent structures (PLS), support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and random forest (RF), have been successfully used in metabolomics, their performance including strengths and limitations in clinical data analysis has not been clear to researchers due to the lack of systematic evaluation of these tools. In this paper we comparatively evaluated the four classifiers, PLS, SVM, LDA, and RF, in the analysis of clinical metabolomic data derived from gas chromatography mass spectrometry platform of healthy subjects and patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer, where cross-validation, R 2 / Q 2 plot, receiver operating characteristic curve, variable reduction, and Pearson correlation were performed.

Although clinical studies suggest that the use of essential oils may have therapeutic potential, evidence for the efficacy of aromatherapy in treating medical conditions remains poor, with a particular lack of studies employing rigorous analytical methods that capture its identifiable impact on human biology. Here, we report a comprehensive metabolomics study that reveals metabolic changes in people after exposed to aroma inhalation for 10 continuous days. In this study, the metabolic alterations in urine of 31 females with mild anxiety symptoms exposed to aerial diffusion of aromas were measured by GC-TOF-MS and UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analyses. A significant alteration of metabolic profile in subjects responsive to essential oil was found, which is characterized by the increased levels of arginine, homocysteine, and betaine, as well as decreased levels of alcohols, carbohydrates, and organic acids in urine. Notably, the metabolites from tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and gut microbial metabolism were significantly altered. This study demonstrates that the metabolomics approach can capture the subtle metabolic changes resulting from exposure to essential oils, which may lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of aromatherapy. © 2013 Yinan Zhang et al.

84879388581	Metabonomics identifies serum metabolite markers of colorectal cancer	Recent studies suggest that biofluid-based metabonomics may identify metabolite markers promising for colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis. We report here a follow-up replication study, after a previous CRC metabonomics study, aiming to identify a distinct serum metabolic signature of CRC with diagnostic potential. Serum metabolites from newly diagnosed CRC patients (N = 101) and healthy subjects (N = 102) were profiled using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS). Differential metabolites were identified with statistical tests of orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (VIP > 1) and the Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05). With a total of 249 annotated serum metabolites, we were able to differentiate CRC patients from the healthy controls using an orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) in a learning sample set of 62 CRC patients and 62 matched healthy controls. This established model was able to correctly assign the rest of the samples to the CRC or control groups in a validation set of 39 CRC patients and 40 healthy controls. Consistent with our findings from the previous study, we observed a distinct metabolic signature in CRC patients including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, urea cycle, glutamine, fatty acids, and gut flora metabolism. Our results demonstrated that a panel of serum metabolite markers is of great potential as a noninvasive diagnostic method for the detection of CRC. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84880627110	A targeted metabolomic protocol for short-chain fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids	Research in obesity and metabolic disorders that involve intestinal microbiota demands reliable methods for the precise measurement of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) concentration. Here, we report a rapid method of simultaneously determining SCFAs and BCAAs in biological samples using propyl chloroformate (PCF) derivatization followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. A one-step derivatization using 100 μL of PCF in a reaction system of water, propanol, and pyridine (v/v/v = 8:3:2) at pH 8 provided the optimal derivatization efficiency. The best extraction efficiency of the derivatized products was achieved by a two-step extraction with hexane. The method exhibited good derivatization efficiency and recovery for a wide range of concentrations with a low limit of detection for each compound. The relative standard deviations of all targeted compounds showed good intra- and inter-day (within 7 days) precision (<10 %), and good stability (<20 %) within 4 days at room temperature (23-25 °C), or 7 days when stored at -20 °C. We applied our method to measure SCFA and BCAA levels in fecal samples from rats administrated with different diet. Both univariate and multivariate statistical analysis of the concentrations of these targeted metabolites could differentiate three groups with ethanol intervention and different oils in diet. This method was also successfully employed to determine SCFA and BCAA in the feces, plasma and urine from normal humans, providing important baseline information of the concentrations of these metabolites. This novel metabolic profile study has great potential for translational research. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84881159364	Serum metabolic signatures of four types of human arthritis	Similar symptoms of the different types of arthritis have continued to confound the clinical diagnosis and represent a clinical dilemma making treatment choices with a more personalized or generalized approach. Here we report a mass spectrometry-based metabolic phenotyping study to identify the global metabolic defects associated with arthritis as well as metabolic signatures of four major types of arthritis - rheumatoid arthritis (n = 27), osteoarthritis (n = 27), ankylosing spondylitis (n = 27), and gout (n = 33) - compared with healthy control subjects (n = 60). A total of 196 metabolites were identified from serum samples using a combined gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) and ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF MS). A global metabolic profile is identified from all arthritic patients, suggesting that there are common metabolic defects resulting from joint inflammation and lesion. Meanwhile, differentially expressed serum metabolites are identified constituting an unique metabolic signature of each type of arthritis that can be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and patient stratification. The results highlight the applicability of metabonomic phenotyping as a novel diagnostic tool for arthritis complementary to existing clinical modalities. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84885759123	Prognostic significance of 2-hydroxyglutarate levels in acute myeloid leukemia in China	The 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) has been reported to result from mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) genes and to function as an "oncometabolite." To evaluate the clinical significance of serum 2-HG levels in hematologic malignancies, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in particular, we analyzed this metabolite in distinct types of human leukemia and lymphoma and established the range of serum 2-HG in appropriate normal control individuals by using gas chromatograph-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Aberrant serum 2-HG pattern was detected in the multicenter group of AML, with 62 of 367 (17%) patients having 2-HG levels above the cutoff value (2.01, log2-transformed from 4.03 μg/mL). IDH1/2 mutations occurred in 27 of 31 (87%) AML cases with very high 2-HG, but were observed only in 9 of 31 (29%) patients with moderately high 2-HG, suggesting other genetic or biochemical events may exist in causing 2-HG elevation. Indeed, glutamine-related metabolites exhibited a pattern in favor of 2-HG synthesis in the high 2-HG group. In AML patients with cytogenetically normal AML (n = 234), high 2-HG represented a negative prognostic factor in both overall survival and event-free survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed high serum 2-HG as a strong prognostic predictor independent of other clinical and molecular features. We also demonstrated distinct gene-expression/ DNA methylation profiles in AML blasts with high 2-HG compared with those with normal ones, supporting a role that 2- HG plays in leukemogenesis.

84885358240	Metabolic signatures of kidney yang deficiency syndrome and protective effects of two herbal extracts in rats using GC/TOF MS	Kidney Yang Deficiency Syndrome (KDS-Yang), a typical condition in Chinese medicine, shares similar clinical signs of the glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome. To date, the underlying mechanism of KDS-Yang has been remained unclear, especially at the metabolic level. In this study, we report a metabolomic profiling study on a classical model of KDS-Yang in rats induced by hydrocortisone injection to characterize the metabolic transformation using gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. WKY1, a polysaccharide extract from Astragalus membranaceus and Lycium barbarum, and WKY2, an aqueous extract from a similar formula containing Astragalus membranaceus, Lycium barbarum, Morinda officinalis, Taraxacum mongolicum, and Cinnamomum cassia presl, were used separately for protective treatments of KDS-Yang. The changes of serum metabolic profiles indicated that significant alterations of key metabolic pathways in response to abrupt hydrocortisone perturbation, including decreased energy metabolism (lactic acid, acetylcarnitine), lipid metabolism (free fatty acids, 1-monolinoleoylglycerol, and cholesterol), gut microbiota metabolism (indole-3-propionic acid), biosynthesis of catecholamine (norepinephrine), and elevated alanine metabolism, were attenuated or normalized with different degrees by the pretreatment of WKY1 or WKY2, which is consistent with the observations in which the two herbal agents could ameliorate biochemical markers of serum cortisone, adrenocorticotropic (ACTH), and urine 17- hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS). © 2013 Linjing Zhao et al.

84890059083	Very low carbohydrate diet significantly alters the serum metabolic profiles in obese subjects	Emerging evidence has consistently shown that a very low carbohydrate diet (VLCD) can protect against the development of obesity, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we applied a comprehensive metabonomics approach using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to study the effects of an 8-week dietary intervention with VLCD on serum metabolic profiles in obese subjects. The VLCD intervention resulted in a weight loss and significantly decreased homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance. The metabonomics analysis identified a number of differential serum metabolites (p < 0.05) primarily attributable to fatty acids, amino acids including branched chain amino acids, amines, lipids, carboxylic acids, and carbohydrates in obese subjects compared to healthy controls. The correlation analysis among time, VLCD intervention, and clinical parameters revealed that the changes of metabolites correlated with the changes of clinical parameters and showed differences in males and females. Fatty acids, amino acids, and carboxylic acids were increased in obese subjects compared with their normal healthy counterparts. Such increased levels of serum metabolites were attenuated after VLCD intake, suggesting that the health beneficial effects of VLCD are associated with attenuation of impaired fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. It also appears that VLCD induced significant metabolic alterations independent of the obesity-related metabolic changes. The altered metabolites in obese subjects post-VLCD intervention include arachidonate, cis-11,14-eicosadienoate, cis-11,14,17-eicosatrienoate, 2-aminobutyrate, acetyl-carnitine, and threonate, all of which are involved in inflammation and oxidation processes. The results revealed favorable shifts in fatty acids and amino acids after VLCD intake in obese subjects, which should be considered biomarkers for evaluating health beneficial effects of VLCD and similar dietary interventions. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84893824048	Metabonomic profiling of human placentas reveals different metabolic patterns among subtypes of neural tube defects	Neural tube defects (NTDs) are one of the most common types of birth defects with a complex etiology. We have previously profiled serum metabolites of pregnant women in Lvliang prefecture, Shanxi Province of China, which revealed distinct metabolic changes in pregnant women with NTDs outcome. Here we present a metabonomics study of human placentas of 144 pregnant women with normal pregnancy outcome and 115 pregnant women affected with NTDs recruited from four rural counties (Pingding, Xiyang, Taigu, and Zezhou) of Shanxi Province, the area with the highest prevalence worldwide. A panel of 19 metabolites related to one-carbon metabolism was also quantitatively determined. We observed obvious differences in global metabolic profiles and one-carbon metabolism among three subtypes of NTDs, anencephaly (Ane), spina bifida (SB), and Ane complicated with SB (Ane & SB) via mass-spectrometry-based metabonomics approach. Disturbed carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid, and nucleic acid metabolism were identified. Placental transport of amino acids might be depressed in Ane and Ane & SB group. Deficiency of choline contributes to Ane and Ane & SB pathogenesis via different metabolic pathways. The formation of NTDs seemed to be weakly related to folates. The metabonomic analysis reveals that the physiological and biochemical processes of the three subtypes of NTDs might be different and the subtype condition should be considered for the future investigation of NTDs. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84896338313	Metabolomics analysis reveals variation in Schisandra chinensis cetabolites from different origins	Wu Wei Zi (Schisandra chinensis), an important herbal medicine, is mainly distributed in the northeast of China. Its phytochemical compositions, which depend on geographical origin, climatic conditions and cultural practices, may vary largely among Wu Wei Zi from different areas. In this study, we applied a comprehensive metabolite profiling approach using GC-TOF-MS, ultra-performance LC (UPLC) quadrupole TOF (QTOF) MS and inductively coupled plasma MS to systematically investigate the metabolite variations of S. chinensis from four different areas including Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, and Shanxi of China. A total of 65 primary metabolites, 35 secondary metabolites and 64 inorganic elements were identified. Several primary metabolites, including shikimic acid and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, were abundant in those located in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning. Besides, bioactive lignans are also highly abundant in those from northeastern China than those from northwestern China. Inorganic elements varied significantly among the different locations. Our results suggested that the metabolite profiling approach using GC-TOF-MS, ultra-performance LC quadrupole TOF MS, and inductively coupled plasma MS is a robust and reliable method that can be effectively used to explore subtle variations among plants from different geographical locations. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84899020281	A distinct metabolic signature of human colorectal cancer with prognostic potential	Purpose: Metabolic phenotyping has provided important biomarker findings, which, unfortunately, are rarely replicated across different sample sets due to the variations from different analytical and clinical protocols used in the studies. To date, very few metabolic hallmarks in a given cancer type have been confirmed and validated by use of a metabolomic approach and other clinical modalities. Here, we report a metabolomics study to identify potential metabolite biomarkers of colorectal cancer with potential theranostic value. Experimental Design: Gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS)-based metabolomics was used to analyze 376 surgical specimens, which were collected from four independent cohorts of patients with colorectal cancer at three hospitals located in China and City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in the United States. Differential metabolites were identified and evaluated as potential prognostic markers. A targeted transcriptomic analysis of 29 colorectal cancer and 27 adjacent nontumor tissues was applied to analyze the gene expression levels for key enzymes associated with these shared metabolites. Results: A panel of 15 significantly altered metabolites was identified, which demonstrates the ability to predict the rate of recurrence and survival for patients after surgery and chemotherapy. The targeted transcriptomic analysis suggests that the differential expression of these metabolites is due to robust metabolic adaptations in cancer cells to increased oxidative stress as well as demand for energy, and macromolecular substrates for cell growth and proliferation. Conclusions: These patients with colorectal cancer, despite their varied genetic background, mutations, pathologic stages, and geographic locations, shared a metabolic signature that is of great prognostic and therapeutic potential. © 2014 AACR.

84899846964	Plasma metabolite profiles of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment	Previous studies have demonstrated altered metabolites in samples of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the sample size from many of them is relatively small and the metabolites are relatively limited. Here we applied a comprehensive platform using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-time-of- flight mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to analyze plasma samples from AD patients, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, and normal controls. A biomarker panel consisting of six plasma metabolites (arachidonic acid, N,N-dimethylglycine, thymine, glutamine, glutamic acid, and cytidine) was identified to discriminate AD patients from normal control. Another panel of five plasma metabolites (thymine, arachidonic acid, 2-aminoadipic acid, N,N-dimethylglycine, and 5,8-tetradecadienoic acid) was able to differentiate aMCI patients from control subjects. Both biomarker panels had good agreements with clinical diagnosis. The 2 panels of metabolite markers were all involved in fatty acid metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and nucleic acid metabolism. Additionally, no altered metabolites were found among the patients at different stages, as well as among those on anticholinesterase medication and those without anticholinesterase medication. These findings provide a comprehensive global plasma metabolite profiling and may contribute to making early diagnosis as well as understanding the pathogenic mechanism of AD and aMCI. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

84907052446	A distinct glucose metabolism signature of acute myeloid leukemia with prognostic value	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a group of hematological malignancies with high heterogeneity. There is an increasing need to improve the risk stratification of AML patients, including those with normal cytogenetics, using molecular biomarkers. Here, we report a metabolomics study that identified a distinct glucose metabolism signature with 400 AML patients and 446 healthy controls. The glucose metabolism signature comprises a panel of 6 serum metabolite markers, which demonstrated prognostic value in cytogenetically normal AML patients. We generated a prognosis risk score (PRS) with 6 metabolite markers for each patient using principal component analysis. A low PRS was able to predict patients with poor survival independently of well-established markers. We further compared the gene expression patterns of AML blast cells between low and high PRS groups, which correlated well to the metabolic pathways involving the 6 metabolite markers, with enhanced glycolysis and trichloracetic acid cycle at gene expression level in low PRS group. In vitro results demonstrated enhanced glycolysis contributed to decreased sensitivity to antileukemic agent arabinofuranosyl cytidine (Ara-C), whereas inhibition of glycolysis suppressed AML cell proliferation and potentiated cytotoxicity of Ara-C. Our study provides strong evidence for the use of serum metabolites and metabolic pathways as novel prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for AML.

84914170164	The metabolite profiles of the obese population are gender-dependent	Studies have identified that several amino acids, in particular, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), have increased significantly in obese individuals when compared to lean individuals. Additionally, these metabolites were strongly associated with future diabetes, which rendered them prognostic markers suitable for obese populations. Here we report a metabonomic study that reveals new findings on the role of these amino acid markers, particularly BCAAs, in a Chinese cohort including 106 healthy obese and 105 healthy lean participants. We found that the BCAAs were correlated with insulin resistance and differentially expressed in obese men, but not in obese women. The results were verified with two independent groups of participants (Chinese, n = 105 and American, n = 72) and demonstrate that the serum metabolite profiles of the obese population are gender-dependent. The study supports the previous findings of a panel of several key metabolites as prognostic markers of the obese population and highlights the need to take into account gender differences when using these markers for risk assessment.
