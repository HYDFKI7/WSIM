84931748991	Insight into the thermal decomposition of kaolinite intercalated with potassium acetate: An evolved gas analysis	The thermal decomposition process of kaolinite-potassium acetate intercalation complex has been studied using simultaneous thermogravimetry coupled with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (TG-FTIR-MS). The results showed that the thermal decomposition of the complex took place in four temperature ranges, namely 50-100, 260-320, 320-550, and 650-780 °C. The maximal mass losses rate for the thermal decomposition of the kaolinite-potassium acetate intercalation complex was observed at 81, 296, 378, 411, 486, and 733 °C, which was attributed to (a) loss of the adsorbed water, (b) thermal decomposition of surface-adsorbed potassium acetate (KAc), (c) the loss of the water coordinated to potassium acetate in the intercalated kaolinite, (d) the thermal decomposition of intercalated KAc in the interlayer of kaolinite and the removal of inner surface hydroxyls, (e) the loss of the inner hydroxyls, and (f) the thermal decomposition of carbonate derived from the decomposition of KAc. The thermal decomposition of intercalated potassium acetate started in the range 320-550 °C accompanied by the release of water, acetone, carbon dioxide, and acetic acid. The identification of pyrolysis fragment ions provided insight into the thermal decomposition mechanism. The results showed that the main decomposition fragment ions of the kaolinite-KAc intercalation complex were water, acetone, carbon dioxide, and acetic acid. TG-FTIR-MS was demonstrated to be a powerful tool for the investigation of kaolinite intercalation complexes. It delivers a detailed insight into the thermal decomposition processes of the kaolinite intercalation complexes characterized by mass loss and the evolved gases. © 2014 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

33745300074	Vulcanized rubber composites filled with nanokaolin and precipitated silica	With methods of vulcanizing and mechanical testing, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscope (TEM), the curability, mechanical properties, microstructure, and the thermal stability of the styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), natural rubber (NR), butadiene rubber (BR), and ethylene-propylene diene methylene (EPDM) composites which are filled respectively by nanokaolin (NK) and precipitated silica (PS) were characterized and compared. The results show that NK effectively improves the operation safety of prophase vulcanizing rubbers, quickens the vulcanization rate, and availably advances the production efficiency. The rubber composites filled with nanokaolin are of outstanding elasticity, and its tensile strength closes to the precipitated silica, but the tear strength and the modulus is not superior to the precipitated silica. NK sheets are well dispersed in the rubber matrix in the parallel direction with less than 100 nm. The good interface links between NK and rubber molecules are contributed to the excellent thermal stability of the rubber composites.

0032661286	Study on surface modification of calcined kaolin from coal-bearing strata	The surface modification of calcined kaolin from coal-bearing strata in Xiaoyu Coal Mine of Shanxi Province is studied. The calcined kaolin is modified by silane coupling agent under certain program. The results indicate that the modification process has greatly changed the surface feature of calcined kaolin from hydrophilic to oleophilic. The modified kaolin, when used as filler of rubber, is better in improving the mechanic property of rubber than that of the unmodified. In order to explore the modification mechanism, the modified samples are analyzed by IR and MAS NMR, and compared with the unmodified ones. The result shows that the chemical environment of Al-O in the surface of calcined kaolinite is changed obviously, but that of Si-O changed only a little. This result shows that the modification is mainly completed by linking Al on the surface of calcined kaolin with the silane coupling agent molecules, but no sufficient evidences can certify if Si-O is also linked with the silane coupling agent molecules.

The activated treatment may be followed by treatment with silane coupling agent KH-560 to further modify the surface properties of the mineral. The factors of different treatment conditions such as temperature time PH value and amount of activated agent were analyzed. The effect of the activated modification was investigated by means of sedimentation volume and bulk density. Finally, precipitated silica direct modified and activated modified clay fillers have been incorporated in styrene butadiene rubber (SBR). Mechanical properties reveal that there is a definite improvement using activated modified kaolin compared to the control samples, probably due to successful enhancement in interaction between the activated modified clay and the base polymer.

69249208439	A novel biodegradable nanocomposite based on poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) and silylated kaolinite/silica core-shell nanoparticles	A novel biodegradable nanocomposite was fabricated based on poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) and silane-modified kaolinite/silica core-shell nanoparticles (SMKS), via solution-casting method using chloroform as solvent. Unmodified (ORK) and glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (G-silane) surface-modified kaolin (SMK) were also introduced into PHBHHx matrix for comparison. SMKS significantly improved the mechanical properties of the PHBHHx compared to that of ORK and SMK. The composite filled with a low loading of SMKS increased the tensile strength and toughness from 18.2 to 23.5 MPa and 2.6 to 4.2 MPa, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that SMKS was finely distributed in the PHBHHx matrix compared with the other two kinds of fillers. These significant improvements in these mechanical properties were attributed to the fine dispersion of SMKS into the polymer and covalent interaction between polymer chains and the surface of SMKS. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

0035456089	The origins of kaolinite-rich rocks associated with coal measures in China	Kaolinite-rich rocks are widespread in Chinese coal-bearing strata. Three main types of deposits are recognized. Those deposits identified as flint clays are several metres thick and show lateral variations in bed composition. The kaolinite is thought to have formed mainly on the adjacent landmass, but some crystallization of gels within the basin is not ruled out. Tonsteins, which formed from the in situ alteration of airfall volcanic ashes, are very common in the coal measures and are up to 0.5 m thick. Finally, kaolinite deposits are described where the development of kaolin is related to weathering of coals either close to or at the present land surface.

71749100030	Study of kaolinite rock in coal bearing stratum, North China	The proved reserves of kaolinite in coal measures in China is very rich, most of which are excellent industrial materials and are associated with the Permo-Carboniferous strata of North China. There are three types of kaolinite rocks in the present research area: the first type (be called tonsteins) occurs in the roofs, partings and floors of coal seams, normally called tonsteins, which are thinner and widespread; the second type, usually 2~6 m thick, is not adjacent to coal seams, usually in the lower part of coal measures of Upper Permian, similar to the flint clay in North America; the third type is soft kaolin clay of 0.5~5 m in thickness and associated with surficial weathered coals. Results of XRD, IR, DTA and SEM studies show that the content of kaolinite minerals is in general more than 70% and up to 90%~100% in some good quality rocks. The elements of Mo, W, Zr, Hf, Th, Ag and Sb are very rich in kaolinite rocks in the study area, with their average contents being higher than those in the earth's crust, basalt and granite. It is suggested that tonsteins formed from the in situ alteration of air fall volcanic ashes, second type of kaolinite have formed mainly on the adjacent landmass, but some crystallization of gels within the basin is not ruled out, the third type of kaolinite is related to weathering of coals. © 2009.

The mechanical properties, gas barrier properties, thermal stability and microstructure of SBR composites were investigated. Results showed that MK was well dispersed in the nano-scale and was on parallel arrangement clearly in the rubber matrix. The kaolin sheets trapped the rubber molecular chains and confined its free movement, which improved the mechanical properties and thermal stability of SBR composites markedly. The impervious kaolin sheets prolonged the penetrating path of gas molecules in the rubber composites, which reduced the permeability about 40% ∼60% and improved the gas barrier property of the rubber composite effectively. Moreover, the plate-like MK provided better barrier capability than the spherical PS.

XRD, FT-IR and DSC-TG were used to investigate the intercalation complex. It is revealed that DMSO molecule intercalated successfully into the interlayer of kaolinite, and formed new hydrogen bonds with the inner surface hydroxyls of kaolinite. Thus led to the basal spacing of kaolinite increased from 0.714 to 1.121nm, and the dehydroxylation temperature of kaolinite decreased from 541 to 523°C.

It is also found that decarbonization took place at 710 °C due to the decomposition of calcite impurity in kaolin. The temperature of dehydroxylation of kaolinite is found to be influenced by the degree of disorder of the kaolinite structure and the gases evolved in the decomposition process can be various because of the different amount and kinds of impurities. It is evident by the mass-spectra that the interlayer carbonate from impurity of calcite and organic carbon is released as CO

77957607645	Thermal behavior and decomposition of kaolinite-potassium acetate intercalation composite	A series of kaolinite-potassium acetate intercalation composite was prepared. The thermal behavior and decomposition of these composites were investigated by simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetric analysis (DSC-TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transformation infrared (FT-IR). The XRD pattern at room temperature indicated that intercalation of potassium acetate into kaolinite causes an increase of the basal spacing from 0.718 to 1.428 nm. The peak intensity of the expanded phase of the composite decreased with heating above 300 °C, and the basal spacing reduced to 1.19nm at 350 °C and 0.718nm at 400 °C. These were supported by DSC-TGA and FT-IR results, where the endothermic reactions are observed between 300 and 600 °C. These reactions can be divided into two stages: (1) removal of the intercalated molecules between 300 and 400 °C. (2) dehydroxylation of kaolinite between 400 and 600 °C.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to characterize the NR composites. The kaolinite particles were finely dispersed into the natural rubber matrix and arranged in parallel orientation. Compared to the pure NR, these highly filled NR/SMK composites exhibited outstanding mechanical properties, excellent gas barrier properties and much higher thermal stability. The gas barrier properties of NR composites with SMK and PS were much higher than those of NR/PS composites and better than those of NR/SMK. The nitrogen permeability of NR/SMK composites was decreased by 20-40% after filling with kaolin. The significant improvements in the mechanical properties, thermal stability and gas barrier properties may be attributed to the parallel kaolinite particles which restricted the free movement of rubber chains and retarded the diffusion of the gas molecules. Thus, the highly filled NR/SMK composites may be used to improve the air-tightness of rubber products. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

78649442196	Influencing factors on kaolinite-potassium acetate intercalation complexes	This paper presents an immersion method for preparing the kaolinite-potassium acetate intercalation complexes. The effectiveness of intercalation and influencing factors were analysed and evaluated. The results show that the intercalation of kaolinite by potassium acetate is strongly related to crystallinity of kaolinite, concentration of intercalating agent solution, aging time and pH. The well-crystallized kaolinite is conducive to intercalation by potassium acetate. A higher concentration of intercalating agent (≥ 30%) can complete the intercalation in a short time (< 12. h), but at lower concentrations intercalation took significantly longer (≥ 144 h). The weak alkaline condition of pH = 10 proved to be the most suitable environment for the formation of intercalation complex. A good intercalated complex can be obtained at room temperature. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that a layer of ultrafine silica particles was deposited on the kaolinite surface. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy also indicated the grafting of the silane onto the silica coated kaolinite particles. To evaluate the improved properties of SMKS filled SBR composite, samples filled with unmodified kaolinite (ORK), silane modified kaolinite (SMK) and precipitated silica (PS) were also analyzed. The composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal analysis and mechanical properties analysis. SMKS had a great effect on the thermal properties, and achieved high performance and pronounced mechanical properties. The stress at a strain of 300% and 500% and the tensile strength of the SMKS-rubber were much better than the rubber loaded with SMK and ORK. The tensile strength of the SMKS filled rubber reached to 15.5. MPa, much higher than that of SMK (11.6. MPa) and ORK (9.9. MPa).

84865029144	The thermal behavior of kaolinite intercalation complexes-A review	The kaolinite intercalation and its application in polymer-based functional composites have attracted great interest, both in industry and in academia fields, since they frequently exhibit remarkable improvements in materials properties compared with the virgin polymer or conventional micro and macro-composites. Also of significant interest regarding the kaolinite intercalation complex is its thermal behavior and decomposition. This is because heating treatment of intercalated kaolinite is necessary for its further application, especially in the field of plastic and rubber industry. Although intercalation of kaolinite is an old and ongoing research topic, there is a limited knowledge available on kaolinite intercalation with different reagents, the mechanism of intercalation complex formation as well as on thermal behavior and phase transition. This review attempts to summarize the most recent achievements in the thermal behavior study of kaolinite intercalation complexes obtained with the most common reagents including potassium acetate, formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, hydrazine and urea.

84865434820	An infrared spectroscopic comparison of four Chinese palygorskites	Infrared spectroscopy has been used to characterize and compare four palygorskite mineral samples from China. The position of the main bands identified by infrared spectra is similar, but there are some differences in intensity, which are significant. In addition, several additional bands are observed in the spectra of palygorskite and their impurities. This variability is attributed to differences in the geological environment, such as the degree of weathering and the extent of transportation of the minerals during formation or deposition, and the impurity content in these palygorskites. The bands of water and hydroxyl groups in these spectra of palygorskite samples have been studied. The characteristic band of palygorskite is observed at 1195 cm

84870279428	Preparation and properties of PP/modified kaolin composites	Kaolin from coal measures was modified by silane coupling agent. Using polypropylene (PP) and modified kaolin as raw materials, the PP/modified kaolin composites were prepared with a melt-blending method. XRD, FT-IR, SEM and the mechanical properties testing were used to characterize the modification of kaolin and the effect of filling content of modified kaolin on the mechanical properties of the composites. The results show that the surface modification of kaolin is successful. The optimum impact toughness is achieved with 3% modified kaolin filling, while the elongation at break of the composite filled with 5% modified kaolin reaches the maximum value. The flexural strength and the flexural modulus of the composites increase with the content of modified kaolin increasing. For the composites filled with 10% modified kaolin, these values are increased by 14.5% and 27.5%, respectively, comparing with those of pure PP.

84870920376	Thermal behavior analysis of kaolinite-dimethylsulfoxide intercalation complex	The thermal behavior of kaolinite-dimethylsulfoxide intercalation complex was investigated by thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic analysis. The samples gradually heated up to different temperatures were studied by XRD and FT-IR. The kaolinite-dimethylsulfoxide intercalation complex is stable below 130 °C. With the rise in the temperature, the relative intensity of the 1.124-nm peak gradually decreased and disappeared at 200 °C, however, the intensity of the 0.714 nmpeak increased in the XRD patterns. In the infrared spectra, the appearance of methyl bands at 3018, 2934, 1428, and 1318 cm

84890936147	Influence of kaolinite/carbon black hybridization on combustion and thermal decomposition behaviors of NR composites	A series of NR composites filled with modified kaolinite (MK), carbon black (CB) and the hybrid filler contained MK and CB, were prepared by melt blending. The microstructure, combustion and thermal decomposition behaviors of NR composites were characterized by TEM, XRD, infrared spectroscopy, cone calorimeter test (CCT) and thermal-gravimetric analysis (TG). The results show that the filler hybridization can improve the dispensability and shape of the kaolinite sheets in the rubber matrix and change the interface bond between kaolinite particles and rubber molecules. NR-3 filled by 10 phr MK and 40 phr CB has the lowest heat release rate (HRR), mass loss rate (MLR), total heat release (THR), smoke production rate (SPR) and the highest char residue among all the NR composites. Therefore, the hybridization of the carbon black particles with the kaolinite particles can effectively improve the thermal stability and combustion properties of NR composites. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84893690051	Thermal stability of styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) composites filled with kaolinite/silica hybrid filler	Styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) composites filled with fillers, such as modified kaolinite (MK), precipitated silica (PS), and the hybrid fillers containing MK and PS, were prepared by melt blending. The kaolinite sheets were finely dispersed in the SBR matrix around 20-80 nm in thickness and reached the nano-scale. The SBR composites with fillers exhibited excellent thermal stability compared to the pure SBR. The thermal stability of SBR composites was improved with the increasing of MK mass fraction. When MK hybridized with PS, kaolinite sheets were covered by the fine silica particles and the interface between filler particles and rubber matrix became more indistinct. SBR composite filled by hybrid fillers containing 40 phr MK and 10 phr PS became more difficult in decomposition and was better than that of 50 phr PS/SBR and 50 phr MK/SBR in thermal stability. Therefore, the hybridization of the fine silica particles with the kaolinite particles can effectively improve the thermal stability of SBR composites. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

84896297108	Purification of kaolin by selective activation-flocculation method	In order to remove the finely associated titanous and ferrous impurities and improve the grade and application of kaolin, this paper proposed a novel selective activation-flocculation method for the kaolin purification. The effect of sodium oleate and polyacrylamide for the beneficiation was studied. The mechanism of selective activation-flocculation of titanous and ferrous minerals was revealed. The results show that sodium oleate dramatically improved the purification of kaolin by selective flocculation. The best condition was as follows: the molecular weight of polyacrylamide was 12 million; the dosages of polyacrylamide and sodium oleate were 0.01% and 0.15% respectively. After selective activation-flocculation treatment, the whiteness was increased from the 74.1% to 80.2%. The energy spectrum analysis revealed that the iron and titanous oxide content were separately decreased to 0.45% and 0.68% from 1.37% and 1.52% of the raw kaolin. This technique is expected to be useful for the purification of other kind of clay and the beneficiation of the fine titanous and ferrous minerals.

84899124421	Insight into morphology and structure of different particle sized kaolinites with same origin	The particle size, morphology, crystallinity order and structural defects of four kaolinite samples are characterized by the techniques including particle size analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR). The particle size of four kaolinite samples gradually increases. Four samples all belong to the ordered kaolinite and show a decrease in structural order with the increase of kaolinite particle size. The changes of structural defect are proved by the increase of the band splitting in Raman spectroscopy, the decrease of the intensity of absorption bands in infrared spectroscopy, and the decrease of equivalent silicon atom and the increase of non-equivalent aluminum atom in MAS NMR spectroscopy. The differences in morphology and structural defect are attributed to the broken bonds of Al-O-Si, Al-O-Al and Si-O-Si and the Al substitution for Si in tetrahedral sheets. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84902079183	Thermal stability and decomposition kinetics of styrene-butadiene rubber nanocomposites filled with different particle sized kaolinites	A series of styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) nanocomposites filled with different particle sized kaolinites are prepared via a latex blending method. The thermal stabilities of these clay polymer nanocomposites (CPN) are characterized by a range of techniques including thermogravimetry (TG), digital photos, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. These CPN show some remarkable improvement in thermal stability compared to that of the pure SBR. With the increase of kaolinite particle size, the residual char content and the average activation energy of kaolinite SBR nanocomposites all decrease; the pyrolysis residues become porous; the crystal carbon in the pyrolysis residues decrease significantly from 58.23% to 44.41%. The above results prove that the increase of kaolinite particle size is not beneficial in improving the thermal stability of kaolinite SBR nanocomposites. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84903380397	Intercalation of dodecylamine into kaolinite and its layering structure investigated by molecular dynamics simulation	Dodecylamine was successfully intercalated into the layer space of kaolinite by utilizing the methanol treated kaolinite-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) intercalation complex as an intermediate. The basal spacing of kaolinite, measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD), increased from 0.72. nm to 4.29. nm after the intercalation of dodecylamine. Also, the significant variation observed in the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of kaolinite when intercalated with dodecylamine verified the feasibility of intercalation of dodecylamine into kaolinite. Isothermal-isobaric (NPT) molecular dynamics simulation with the use of Dreiding force field was performed to probe into the layering behavior and structure of nanoconfined dodecylamine in the kaolinite gallery. The concentration profiles of the nitrogen atom, methyl group and methylene group of intercalated dodecylamine molecules in the direction perpendicular to the kaolinite basal surface indicated that the alkyl chains within the interlayer space of kaolinite exhibited an obvious layering structure. However, the unified bilayer, pseudo-trilayer, or paraffin-type arrangements of alkyl chains deduced based on their chain length combined with the measured basal spacing of organoclays were not found in this study. The alkyl chains aggregated to a mixture of ordered paraffin-type-like structure and disordered gauche conformation in the middle interlayer space of kaolinite, and some alkyl chains arranged in two bilayer structures, in which one was close to the silica tetrahedron surface, and the other was close to the alumina octahedron surface with their alkyl chains parallel to the kaolinite basal surface. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84903867976	Influence of the structural characteristic of pyrolysis products on thermal stability of styrene-butadiene rubber composites reinforced by different particle sized kaolinites	A series of rubber composites were prepared by blending styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) latex and the different particle sized kaolinites. The thermal stabilities of the rubber composites were characterized using thermogravimetry, digital photography, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Kaolinite SBR composites showed much greater thermal stability when compared with that of the pure SBR. With the increase of kaolinite particle size, the pyrolysis products became much looser; the char layer and crystalline carbon content gradually decreased in the pyrolysis residues. The pyrolysis residues of the SBR composites filled with the different particle sized kaolinites showed some remarkable changes in structural characteristics. The increase of kaolinite particle size was not beneficial to form the compact and stable crystalline carbon in the pyrolysis process, and resulted in a negative influence in improving the thermal stability of kaolinite/SBR composites. © 2014 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

84904111120	A new method for determining platy particle aspect ratio: A kaolinite case study	A technique based on the detection method of particle size is presented to calculate the aspect ratio of particles with known layered silicate minerals. The principle relies on the premise that objects placed in an electric field modify the current flow of that field. The accurate volume of the testing particle is obtained from the difference of the conductivity of the particles and that of the conductive liquid. Platy particles have a disc-like shape. Therefore, the thickness and diameter of the particle can be calculated from its volume. The aspect ratio of the platy particle is successfully obtained from the results. This study uses a spherical standard sample with a diameter of 10. μm and two different kaolinites that vary in the conductivity of two electrodes by the particles as they pass through the aperture tube. According to the thickness of the particle size and the diameter (width and length) of the disc the particle extracted from the raw data, and the standard particles of the particle-size analyzer (Coulter Multisizer 3), a new method of determining the aspect ratio of the disc-shaped particle is obtained. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84904459389	Thermal behavior of kaolinite-urea intercalation complex and molecular dynamics simulation for urea molecule orientation	The thermal behavior of kaolinite-urea intercalation complex was investigated by thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In addition, the interaction mode of urea molecules intercalated into the kaolinite gallery was studied by means of molecular dynamics simulation. Three main mass losses were observed at 136 °C, in the range of 210-270°C, and at 500 °C in the TG-DSC curves, which were, respectively, attributed to (1) melting of the surface-adsorbed urea, (2) removal of the intercalated urea, and (3) dehydroxylation of the deintercalated kaolinite. The three DSC endothermic peaks at 218, 250, and 261 °C were related to the successive removals of intercalated urea with three different distribution structures. Based on the angle between the dipole moment vector of urea and the basal surface of kaolinite, the three urea models could be described as follows: (1) Type A, the dipole moment vector is nearly parallel to the basal surface of kaolinite; (2) Type B, the dipole moment vector points to the silica tetrahedron with the angle between it and the basal surface of kaolinite ranging from 20°to 40°; and (3) Type C, the dipole moment vector is nearly perpendicular to the basal surface of kaolinite. The three distribution structures of urea molecules were validated by the results of the molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, the thermal behavior of the kaolinite-urea intercalation complex investigated by TG-DSC was also supported by FTIR and XRD analyses. © 2014 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

84907054858	Formation of nanoscrolls and preparation of kaolinite intercalation compound with alkylamines	Kaolinite-alkylamine intercalation compounds were prepared via the intercalation and displacement of Zhangjiakou kaolinite with dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol, and different alkylamines (i.e., isopropylamine, n-butylamine, hexylamine and dodecylamine). The structure and morphology of the kaolinite and its intercalation compounds were characterized. The results show that alkylamines can be intercalated into the interlayer of methoxy-grafted kaolinite, causing the increase of kaolinite basal spacing ranging from 1.24 nm to 4.23 nm. The basal spacing and structure stability of kaolinite intercalation compounds increase with the increment of carbon chain length of alkylamines. The kaolinite sheets intercalated by alkylamine can be delaminated to nanoscrolls with the sizes of 30-100 nm in diameter and 250-2000 nm in length. The shape and productivity of nanoscrolls are related to the alkylamine molecular structure. The more productivity and the better morphology of nanoscrolls, the longer the carbon chain length of alkylamine will be. The entrance of alkylamine into interlayer of kaolinite reduces the hydrogen bonds between kaolinite sheets and provides a large and free space for the formation of nanoscrolls.

84910093260	Resistance method to measure the aspect ratio of kaolinite	Aspect ratio of kaolinite was an important parameter in many areas of kaolin application, however, the appropriate instruments and techniques to measure it have not been put forward so far. The principle of resistance method for grain size measurement reflects the relationship of resistance changes with the particle size and morphology, based on that, the aspect ratio of kaolinite can be calculated. Through detailed analysis of the output data and graph of Coulter Counter instrument worked on resistance law, it was found that the output electrical pulse height reflects the volume of a particle, the electrical pulse width reflects particle length through the hole, and by comparing with standard spherical particle pulse data, the aspect ratio calculation formula of kaolinite was established: AR=3/2{(n+(W-W

84912527318	Mechanism of displacement intercalation preparation of kaolinite-methanol compound	The kaolinite-methanol intercalation compound was synthesized with the precursors of kaolinite-dimethyl sulfoxide compound (KD) and kaolinite-urea compound (KU) via multiple displacements intercalation. The product structure in different stages was determined by X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy, and the displacement mechanism of different precursors by methanol was proposed. The results show that the displacement behaviors vary with different intercalation precursors. It is found that the methanol molecules enter the interlayer of kaolinite in the beginning for the KD precursors, and gradually graft on the inner surface of kaolinite through chemical bonds with increasing the displacement time, thus causing a varied (001) space of kaolinite-methanol intercalation compound. For the KU precursors, the methanol molecules are grafted directly on the inner surface of kaolinite by chemical bonds in the beginning.

0346971060	Preparation and thermal stability of La-Al pillared montmorillonite prepared by power ultrasonics treatment	La-Al pillared montmorillonite was prepared by reacting montmorillonite mixture of aluminum chlorohydrate and lanthanum nitrate under power ultrasonics treatment with the input power of 250 W and the frequency of 20 kHz. The pillaring solution for forming La-Al montmorillonite has an OH/A1 ratio of 2.4, and a La/Al ratio of 1/20. The La-Al pillared montmorillonite is characterized by basal spacing of about 2.65 nm, and its pillared structure is stable at a temperature lower than 650°C. The large spacing and high thermal stability of La-Al pillared montmorillonite are related to the formation of La-bearing Johansson cations intercalated into montmorillonite under the power ultrasonics treatment.

12444327228	Preparation and characterization of polyethylene/montmorillonite nano-composites	Using the organic montmorillonite/cetyltrimethy ammonium bromide (MMT/CTAB) deposited with Ziegler-Natta catalyst as precursor the granular polyethylene/montmorillonite (PE/MMT) nano-composites were prepared by the in situ polymerization method. The microstructure and properties of the nano-composites were investigated by SEM, TEM, XRD and DSC etc and the effects of the content for montmorillonite on the melt point and crystalline behaviors were analyzed. The results show that the structure of montmorillonite is destroyed and the exfoliated nano-montmorillonite slices are dispersed uniformly in the polyethylene matrix. The PE/MMT composites with good properties are obtained when the mass fraction of montmorillonite in the nano-composite materials is about 3%.
