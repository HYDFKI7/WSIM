9444239771	Stable expression of QTL for grain shape of milled rice (Oryza Sativa L.) using a CSSLs population	A set of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs), derived from Asominori/IR24 with Asominori as the recurrent parent, was planted and phenotyped for grain length (GL), grain width (GW) and length-width ratio (LWR) of milled rice in two successive years and four sites. QTL for GL, GW and LWR were characterized and stability of their expression was investigated. The phenotypic values for each trait showed a continuous distribution and some transgressive lines were also observed in the CSSLs population. Additionally, a total of 13 QTL for GL, GW and LWR were identified, and six of them were consistently detected in the eight different environments. Phenotypic values were different significantly (P < 0.001) between the CSSLs harboring any of the six QTL alleles and the genetic background parent, Asominori.

1942505297	QTL Analysis for Rice Stripe Disease Resistance Gene Using Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) Derived from Crossing of Kinmaze and DV85	Rice stripe disease transmitted by small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus Fall.) is one of the most serious viral diseases in East Asia. The disease is severely epidemic in most rice growing areas where the main cultivars are susceptible or moderately susceptible to rice stripe virus. In this research, a recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population of 81 lines derived from a cross of Kinmaze (japonica)/DV85(indica) by the single seed descent method was used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring resistance to rice stripe virus(RSV). The response of the two parents and 81 RILs to RSV were investigated by inoculating seedlings with viruliferous small brown planthopper insects, and scored by the disease rate index. The quantitative trait loci for rice stripe disease resistance were analyzed by QTL Cartographer software. Three QTL controlling RSV resistance were detected on chromosomes 1,7 and 11, respectively. Individual QTL accounted for 19.8%-30.9% of the phenotypic variance in the RILs population. The direction of the additive gene effects at two loci qStv7 and qStv11 coincided with that predicted by phenotypes of the parents. At these two loci, the DV85 alleles increased the resistance to RSV, while at qStv1, the Kinmaze alleles increased the resistance to RSV.

18844375362	Stability of QTLs for rice grain dimension and endosperm chalkiness characteristics across eight environments	Rice appearance quality, including traits specifying grain dimension and endosperm chalkiness, represents a major problem in many rice-producing areas of the world. In this study, the genetic basis of six appearance quality traits of milled rice was dissected into quantitative trait loci (QTL) main effects, and the stability of these QTLs was assessed in a population of 66 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) across eight environments. The CSSLs showed transgressive segregation for many of the traits, and significant correlations were detected among most of the traits. Twenty-two QTLs were identified on eight chromosomes, and numerous QTLs affecting related traits were mapped in the same regions, probably reflecting pleiotropic effects. Nine QTLs, namely qGL-1,qGL-3, qGW-5,qLWR-3, qLWR-5,qPGWC-8, qPGWC-9, qACE-8, and qDEC-8, were consistently detected across the eight environments.

29144522231	The origin of weedy rice Ludao in China deduced by genome wide analysis of its hybrid sterility genes	The authors report here a case of hybrid sterility between an indica cultivar, IR36 and a weedy strain, Ludao, which naturally grows in and around farms in Jiangsu province, China. A genome-wide analysis was performed with a backcross population of IR36/Ludao//IR36 using a total of 151 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers covering the entire rice linkage map. As a result, two loci were found to induce independently the hybrid sterility via female gamete abortion. Of the two loci, the locus on chromosome 6 corresponded to S10 according to its chromosomal location, while the other one on chromosome 7 was different from all the previously reported hybrid sterility loci, and was designated as S30(t). Based on the allelic interaction which causes female gamete abortion, two alleles were identified: S30(t)-i in IR36 and S30(t)-j in Ludao. In the heterozygote, S30(t)-i/S30(t)-j, which was semi-sterile, female gametes carrying S30(t)-j were partially aborted. A javanica variety, Ketan Nangka, and an Aus variety, N22, carried the neutral allele, S30(t)-n. Thus, Ludao was found to harbor a hybrid sterility gene different from that of existing cultivars in China, as an evidence of its origin from an ancient wild rice variety.

3142709370	Inheritance and QTL mapping of low temperature germinability in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling low temperature germinability (LTG) in rice were identified using 81 recombinant inbreed lines (RILs) derived from a cross between a japonica variety Kinmaze and an indica variety DV85. The accurate condition of LTG evaluation was assumed at 15°C for 10 d after removing the effect of dormancy and the second dormancy. By setting check, the scores of LTG in this study were evaluated. The germination rate at 15°C for 10 d was scored to represent the LTG. The LTG of the RILs ranged from 0 to 99%. By single point analysis, simple interval mapping, and composite interval mapping, 5 putative QTL, qLTG-2, qLTG-6, qLTG-7, qLTG-11 and qLTG-12 were detected on chromosomes 2, 6, 7, 11 and 12. respectively. At the regions of qLTG-2, qLTG-6 and qLTG-11, DV85 alleles increased the LTG, while Kinmaze alleles increased it at the regions of qLTG-7 and qLTG-12. Among the five QTLs reported here, qLTG-2, qLTG-7 and qLTG-12 were newly detected, while the other two QTL-containing regions were close to those previously reported. Epistatic QTL were also detected in this paper.

Heading date in most combinations using II-32A shows transgressive inheritance or similarity to the latter parent, but the genotype of II-32A with respect to major genes for heading time is unknown. This limits the further exploitation of this sterile line in breeding and hybrid seed production. Using a number of major gene heading date isogenic lines and heading date QTL near-isogenic lines, we genetically analyzed II-32B under both long- and short-day conditions. We show that II-32B carries two photoperiod-sensitive genes, E1 and E3, a recessive late-heading gene, ef-1, and a photoperiod-sensitive allele, Se-1

33749508095	QTL analysis of aluminum resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Aluminum (Al) toxicity is considered as one of the primary causes of low-rice productivity in acid soils. In the present study, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling Al resistance based on relative root elongation (RRE) were dissected using a complete linkage map and a recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross of Al-tolerant japonica cultivar Asominori (Oryza sativa L.) and Al-sensitive indica cultivar IR24 (O. sativa L.). A total of three QTLs (qRRE-1, qRRE-9, and qRRE-11) were detected on chromosomes 1, 9, and 11 with LOD score ranging from 2.64 to 3.60 and the phenotypic variance explained from 13.5 to 17.7%. The Asominori alleles were all associated with Al resistance at all the three QTLs. The existence of these QTLs was confirmed using Asominori chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) in IR24 genetic background (IAS). By QTL comparative analysis, the two QTLs (qRRE-1and qRRE-9) on chromosomes 1 and 9 appeared to be consistent among different rice populations while qRRE-11 was newly detected and syntenic with a major Al resistance gene on chromosome 10 of maize. This region may provide an important case for isolating genes responsible for different mechanisms of Al resistance among different cereals. These results also provide the possibilities of enhancing Al resistance in rice breeding program by marker-assisted selection (MAS) and pyramiding QTLs. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

33847389868	Two novel loci for pollen sterility in hybrids between the weedy strain Ludao and the Japonica variety Akihikari of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Partial pollen sterility has been observed in hybrid progeny derived from a japonica cultivar, Akihikari and a weedy strain, Ludao, which naturally grows in Jiangsu province of east China. Cytological and histological analyses revealed that pollen abortion occurred largely at the bicellular pollen stage, primarily due to the gradual disaggregation of generative and vegetative cells. A genome-wide analysis was further carried out in a backcross population of Akihikari //Ludao/Akihikari using a total of 118 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and an expressed sequence tag (EST) marker distributed on the entire rice linkage map. Two loci controlling hybrid pollen sterility, designated as S33(t) and S34(t), were located on chromosomes 3 and 11, respectively. Both loci were putatively different from all the previously reported gametophyte genes and hybrid pollen sterility loci. Interaction between the Ludao and Akihikari alleles at each of the two loci resulted in reduction of fertility in the pollens carring the Ludao alleles. To map the precise location of the major locus, S33(t), we selected 165 plants of the backcross population with pollen fertility higher than 80.0%, and assayed the recombinant events surrounding the S33(t) locus using newly developed SSR markers. The S33(t) was delimited to an 86 kb region between SSR markers RM15621 and RM15627. Sequence analysis of this region indicated that there were ten open reading frames. These results will be valuable for cloning this gene and marker-assisted transferring of the corresponding neutral allele in rice breeding programs. Furthermore, the origin of the weedy strain Ludao is discussed. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

34248324821	Physiological function of the qPGWC-9 related to high percentage of rice grains with chalkiness	Percentage of grains with chalkiness (PGWC), one of the important traits assessing rice grain appearance quality, belonged to qualitative trait controlled by many genes. Our previous study identified a novel quantitative trait locus (QTL), namely qPGWC-9, related to high PGWC using chromosomal segment substitution line (CSSL) population. qPGWC-9 was shown to be expressed stably in eight environments. AIS82 which carried a IR24 chromosomal segment corresponding to qPGWC-9 in the Asominori genetic background was selected and analyzed to clarify the physiological function of qPGWC-9 from the relationship of source and sink of carbohydrates. It showed that AIS82 had higher PGWC than Asominori (control variety with low PGWC) (Table 1). The net photosynthetic rate of flag leaf of AIS82 showed no significant difference from that of Asominori (Figs.1, 2), so photosynthetic ability in flag leaf was not directly related with high PGWC in AIS82. But, the changes in pattern of activity of the key enzymes associated with starch synthesis were different in these plants. Activities of some key enzymes in starch synthesis in AIS82 changed more radically than those in Asominori (Fig.3). These results suggest that qPGWC-9 might determine the activities of some enzymes associated with starch synthesis and therefore affect the degree of grain chalkiness.

34548525127	Fine mapping of S31, a gene responsible for hybrid embryo-sac abortion in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Partial abortion of female gametes and the resulting semi-sterility of indica x japonica inter-subspecific rice hybrids have been ascribed to an allelic interaction, which can be avoided by the use of wide compatibility varieties. To further understand the genetic mechanism of hybrid sterility, we have constructed two sets of hybrids, using as male parent either the typical japonica variety Asominori, or the wide compatibility variety 02428; and as female, a set of 66 chromosome segment substitution lines in which various chromosomal segments from the indica variety IR24 have been introduced into a common genetic background of Asominori. Spikelet semi-sterility was observed in hybrid between CSSL34 and Asominori, which is known to carry the sterility gene S31 (Zhao et al. in Euphytica 151:331-337, 2006). Cytological analysis revealed that the semi-sterility of the CSSL34 x Asominori hybrid was caused primarily by partial abortion of the embryo sac at the stage of the mitosis of the functional megaspore. A population of 1,630 progeny of the three-way cross (CSSL34 x 02428) x Asominori was developed to map S31. Based on the physical location of linked molecular markers, S31 was thereby delimited to a 54-kb region on rice chromsome 5. This fragment contains eight predicted open reading frames, four of which encode known proteins and four putative proteins. These results are relevant to the map-based cloning of S31, and the development of marker-assisted transfer of non-sterility allele inducing alleles to breeding germplasm, to allow for a more efficient exploitation of heterosis in hybrid rice. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

34548697707	A chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant with impaired chlorophyllide esterification in chlorophyll biosynthesis	Chlorophyll (Chl) synthase catalyzes esterification of chlorophyllide to complete the last step of Chl biosynthesis. Although the Chl synthases and the corresponding genes from various organisms have been well characterized, Chl synthase mutants have not yet been reported in higher plants. In this study, a rice (Oryza Sativa) Chl-deficient mutant, yellow-green leaf1 (ygl1), was isolated, which showed yellow-green leaves in young plants with decreased Chl synthesis, increased level of tetrapyrrole intermediates, and delayed chloroplast development. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the phenotype of ygl1 was caused by a recessive mutation in a nuclear gene. The ygl1 locus was mapped to chromosome 5 and isolated by map-based cloning. Sequence analysis revealed that it encodes the Chl synthase and its identity was verified by transgenic complementation. A missense mutation was found in a highly conserved residue of YGL1 in the ygl1 mutant, resulting in reduction of the enzymatic activity. YGL1 is constitutively expressed in all tissues, and its expression is not significantly affected in the ygl1 mutant. Interestingly, the mRNA expression of the cab1R gene encoding the Chl a/b-binding protein was severely suppressed in the ygl1 mutant. Moreover, the expression of some nuclear genes associated with Chl biosynthesis or chloroplast development was also affected in ygl1 seedlings. These results indicate that the expression of nuclear genes encoding various chloroplast proteins might be feedback regulated by the level of Chl or Chl precursors. © 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists.

79952309935	Pollen semi-sterility1 encodes a kinesin-1-like protein important for male meiosis, anther dehiscence, and fertility in rice	In flowering plants, male meiosis produces four microspores, which develop into pollen grains and are released by anther dehiscence to pollinate female gametophytes. The molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating male meiosis in rice (Oryza sativa) remain poorly understood. Here, we describe a rice pollen semi-sterility1 (pss1) mutant, which displays reduced spikelet fertility (~40%) primarily caused by reduced pollen viability (~50% viable), and defective anther dehiscence. Map-based molecular cloning revealed that PSS1 encodes a kinesin-1-like protein. PSS1 is broadly expressed in various organs, with highest expression in panicles. Furthermore, PSS1 expression is significantly upregulated during anther development and peaks during male meiosis. The PSS1-green fluorescent protein fusion is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of rice protoplasts. Substitution of a conserved Arg (Arg-289) to His in the PSS1 motor domain nearly abolishes its microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity. Consistent with this, lagging chromosomes and chromosomal bridges were found at anaphase I and anaphase II of male meiosis in the pss1 mutant. Together, our results suggest that PSS1 defines a novel member of the kinesin-1 family essential for male meiotic chromosomal dynamics, male gametogenesis, and anther dehiscence in rice. © American Society of Plant Biologists.

80052269591	Fine mapping of a gene responsible for pollen semi-sterility in hybrids between Oryza sativa L. and O. glaberrima Steud	Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) and African cultivated rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud.) are the two main cultivated rice species in the world, with strong heterosis in their F1 hybrids. However, hybrid sterility is a major barrier, although significant heterosis has been observed. In this study, an F1 pollen semi-sterility locus, S19, was identified on rice chromosome 3 by using near-isogenic lines derived from repeated backcross and marker-assisted selection. The typical pollen semi-sterility was observed in F1 hybrids between S19-NIL and Dianjingyou 1. Cytological study of pollen developmental stages indicated that pollen abortion occurred at the late binucleate stage because of a starch accumulation obstacle in some pollen grains. Molecular analysis revealed that the semi-sterility was caused by the abortion of most male gametophytes carrying the S19 allele from the japonica variety Dianjingyou 1. In a population of 12,780 F2 plants derived from S19-NIL/Dianjingyou 1, the S19 locus was fine-mapped to a chromosomal region of 54 kb based on BAC clones of cv. Nipponbare. Interestingly, an addition of a DNA fragment of about 89 kb to the 54-kb region was found in S19-NIL based on BAC clones of O. glaberrima. Gene prediction analysis identified 12 open reading frames (ORF) based on the region of Dianjingyou 1, while 32 ORFs were predicted in S19-NIL. Map-based cloning of this gene will help us to understand the underlying mechanism of hybrid sterility between the two cultivated rice species. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

43049100333	A novel lipoxygenase gene from developing rice seeds confers dual position specificity and responds to wounding and insect attack	OsLOX1 is a novel full-length cDNA isolated from developing rice seeds. We have examined its biochemical properties and expression patterns. The protein has dual positional specificity, as it releases both C-9 and C-13 oxidized products in a 4:3 ratio. OsLOX1 transcripts were detected at low abundance in immature seeds and newly germinated seedlings, but accumulate rapidly and transiently in response to wounding or brown planthopper (BPH) attack, reaching a peak 3 h after wounding and 6 h after insect feeding. We produced transgenic rice lines carrying either sense or antisense constructs under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, and these rice lines showed altered OsLOX1 activity. In all of the antisense lines and more than half of the sense lines the expression levels of OsLOX1, the levels of enzyme activity, and the levels of the endogenous OsLOX1 products (jasmonic acid, (Z)-3-hexenal and colneleic acid) at 6, 48, and 48 h after BPH feeding respectively, were below the levels found in non-transgenic control plants; yet, the levels in the remaining sense transformants were enhanced relative to controls. Transformants with a lower level of OsLOX1 expression were less able to tolerate BPH attack, while those with enhanced OsLOX1 expression were more resistant. Our data suggest that the OsLOX1 product is involved in tolerance of the rice plant to wounding and BPH attack. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

In the present study, 71 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from the cross of Asominori (Japonica) and IR24 (Indica) were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting cold tolerance at seedling stage. The putative QTL was further confirmed using some chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs), in which IR24 was used as the donor parent and Asominori as the recurrent parent. The average seedling mortality was used as cold tolerance after cold treatment with 6 °C for 7 days and recovery culture with 25 °C for 4 days at three-leaf seedling stage. Three QTL affecting cold tolerance at seedling stage were detected on chromosomes 1, 5 and 6 with LOD scores ranging from 2.2 to 4.1 using composite interval mapping (CIM). Among them, qSCT-1 located in the region of XNpb87-2-C955 on chromosome 1 was a major QTL which explained 24.51% of total phenotypic variance and favorable allele came from japonica parent, Asominori. In addition, IR24 alleles at the other two loci (qSCT-5 and qSCT-6) increased cold tolerance. And these three QTL were confirmed by four lines from the IR24 CSSLs. Transferring favorable allele from japonica variety to indica background or pyramiding different QTL identified from indica is an effective way to improve cold tolerance of rice. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

46149092730	Regulation of IRF2 transcriptional activity by its sumoylation	IRFs constitute a family of transcription factors involved in IFN signaling and in the development and differentiation of the immune system. IRFs activities are regulated at transcriptional level (such as IRF1) and post-translational modifications (such as IRF3 and IRF7). Here we show that IRF2 interacts with the SUMO-E3 ligase PIASy and is sumoylated in vivo. Mutagenesis analysis suggests that IRF2 contains three sumoylation sites. Sumoylation of IRF2 has no significant effects on its nuclear localization and DNA-binding activity, but increases its ability to inhibit IRF1 transcriptional activity and decreases its ability to activate the ISRE and H4 promoters. Our findings suggest that sumoylation of IRF2 regulates its transcriptional activities. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To purify and characterize the OsLOX1 gene from rice seeds, the entire coding region of the OsLOX1 gene was inserted into an expression vector pET30a(+) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Expression of the fusion protein was successfully induced by isopropyl-β-D- thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and the purified recombinant protein was obtained by His·Bind® Kits. Further assay showed that the purified recombinant protein exhibited the LOX activity. The optimum pH was 4.8 (acetate buffer) and the optimum temperature was 30°C for the above enzyme. Thus, the recombinant might confer an available usage for the synthesis of jasmonate in vitro, and also provides a possibility for elucidating the inter-relationship between the primary structure of the plant seed lipoxygenase protein and its physiological functions. © 2008 China National Rice Research Institute.

A total of 16 QTL were identified and mapped on eight chromosomes. Several QTL affecting contents of different protein fractions were mapped in the same chromosomal region. In particular, two QTL with a significant contribution were identified to simultaneously affect prolamin and glutelin contents. One QTL denoted as qCP-12 affecting crude protein content (CP) was located in the same region as QTL qGLT-12 affecting glutelin content, in agreement with the positive correlation between glutelin level and protein content. QTL with larger genetic effects were further confirmed using two sets of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSL), where Asominori and IR24 were used as the recurrent parents. By QTL comparative analysis, two QTL for CP, three for globulin content and one for prolamin content were located in the vicinity of CP QTL previously identified in polished rice.

The germination rate at 15°C, after a 10-day germination culture, was taken as an LTG indicator. A total of 11 QTLs on chromosomes 2, 5, 7, 8, 11, and 12 were detected in the 3 environments by QTL Mapping 2.0 software including the 2 QTLs mapped in similar genomic regions in all the enviroments. The 2 QTLs were located on chromosomes 7 and 11 and origniated from Kinmaze and DV85 each. The maximum percentages of phenotypic variation explained (PVE) of the 2 QTLs were both 27.9%. Epistatic interaction analysis showed slightly low PVE of the 2 QTLs. © 2008 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

A quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis based on a set of recombinant inbred lines extracted from an indica x japonica cross identified a major effect locus (designated qTA-9a) on chromosome 9, which was expressed in two independent environments. The qTA-9a allele derived from the indica parent IR24 increased tiller angle. This QTL was validated in a set of chromosome segment substitution lines involving the same two parental lines.

57449091176	Dynamic QTL analysis on rice fat content and fat index using recombinant inbred lines	Fat content (FC) and fat index (FI) play an important role in determining quality of eating and nutrition for rice . The objective of this study was to determine genetic information during the grain-filling period. Seventy-one recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between japonica cultivar Asominori and indica cultivar IR24 were used to analyze the developmental behavior of FC and FI by conditional and unconditional quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping methods. At four developmental stages of grain filling, 11 unconditional QTL and 10 conditional QTL for FC as well as 11 unconditional QTL and eight conditional QTL for FI were identified. In unconditional QTL analysis, qFC-11-2 and qFI-3 were consistently detected at 21 and 28 days after flowering (DAF), whereas all the conditional QTL for FC and FI could be detected at only one stage. Nine conditional and nine unconditional QTL for FC and FI were detected in the earlier three stages while three and two unconditional QTL for FC and FI, respectively, were detected in the mature stage, which suggested that more QTL could be found in the early developmental stages. The qFC-1-2 and qFI-1-2, qFC-2-2 and qFI-2, qFC-4 and qFI-4, and qFC-9 and qFI-9 were located on the vicinal marker intervals. The present study suggested that accumulation of fat was governed by time-dependent gene expression. In addition, dynamic QTL mapping might be a valid way to reveal more genetic information about the fat accumulation. © 2008 AACC International, Inc.

56849089282	Combining Ability of Yield-Component Traits for Indica Chromosome Substituted Segments in Japonica Hybrid Rice	To study the heterosis of inter-subspecies hybrid in rice (Oryza sativa L.), 10 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) with Asominori (japonica) background derived from Asominori × IR24 (indica) and the parent Asominori were crossed with 6 japonica tester lines (as male parents). A total of 66 combinations were planted in the field with NCII design. The 10 CSSLs had higher general combining abilities (GCAs) than the parent Asominori in the main yield-component traits, excluding the thousand-grain weight. Five CSSLs, AIS84, AIS27, AIS3, AIS80, and AIS76 with chromosome substitution segments from chromosomes 12, 4, 1, 11, and 11, respectively, ranked as the top 5 in the GCA of yield-related characteristics. The results showed stronger heterosis in the indica/japonica combinations at the chromosome segment level than in the typical japonica hybrid rice. Intentionally substituting japonica chromosome segments with indica counterparts, such as, X24-2-R367 in chromosome 12, R1854-R288 in chromosome 4, C970-C955 in chromosome 1, C1350-R257 in chromosome 11, and X52-R2913 in chromosome 11, could significantly promote the yield potential of japonica hybrid rice. Different combinations with one identical parent or different traits in the same combination had significant differences in the specific combining ability (SCA). Combinations with the highest and lowest SCA values were derived from different parental GCA groups, indicating no causal relations between SCA and parental GCA. High GCA combined with strong SCA is a basic principle of parental selection in the breeding programs of super high-yielding hybrid rice. © 2008 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

57049139307	Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight	Grain weight is a major determinant of crop grain yield and is controlled by naturally occurring quantitative trait loci (QTLs). We earlier identified a major QTL that controls rice grain width and weight, GW5, which was mapped to a recombination hotspot on rice chromosome 5. To gain a better understanding of how GW5 controls rice grain width, we conducted fine mapping of this locus and uncovered a 1 212-bp deletion associated with the increased grain width in the rice cultivar Asominori, in comparison with the slender grain rice IR24. In addition, genotyping analyses of 46 rice cultivars revealed that this deletion is highly correlated with the grain-width phenotype, suggesting that the GW5 deletion might have been selected during rice domestication. GW5 encodes a novel nuclear protein of 144 amino acids that is localized to the nucleus. Furthermore, we show that GW5 physically interacts with polyubiquitin in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Together, our results suggest that GW5 represents a major QTL underlying rice width and weight, and that it likely acts in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to regulate cell division during seed development. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling rice grain development and suggests that GW5 could serve as a potential tool for high-yield breeding of crops. © 2008 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

58249125436	Overexpression of a cytosol-localized rhamnose biosynthesis protein encoded by Arabidopsis RHM1 gene increases rhamnose content in cell wall	l-Rhamnose (Rha) is an important constituent of pectic polysaccharides, a major component of the cell walls of Arabidopsis, which is synthesized by three enzymes encoded by AtRHM1, AtRHM2/AtMUM4, and AtRHM3. Despite the finding that RHM1 is involved in root hair formation in Arabidopsis, experimental evidence is still lacking for the in vivo enzymatic activity and subcellular compartmentation of AtRHM1 protein. AtRHM1 displays high similarity to the other members of RHM family in Arabidopsis and in other plant species such as rice and grape. Expression studies with AtRHM1 promoter-GUS fusion gene showed that AtRHM1 was expressed almost ubiquitously, with stronger expression in roots and cotyledons of young seedlings and inflorescences. GFP::AtRHM1 fusion protein was found to be localized in the cytosol of cotyledon cells and of petiole cells of cotyledon, indicating that AtRHM1 is a cytosol-localized protein. The overexpression of AtRHM1 gene in Arabidopsis resulted in an increase of rhamnose content as much as 40% in the leaf cell wall compared to the wild type as well as an alteration in the contents of galactose and glucose. Fourier-transform infrared analyses revealed that surplus rhamnose upon AtRHM1 overexpression contributes to the construction of rhamnogalacturonan. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

58549108594	Fine mapping of the grain chalkiness QTL qPGWC-7 in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Chalkiness of rice grain is an important quality component of rice, as it has a profound influence on eating and milling qualities. We has determined the inheritance of percentage of grain with chalkiness (PGWC) using a set of chromosome segment substitution lines, made from a cross between cv. PA64s and cv. 9311. Two loci controlling PGWC, designated as qPGWC-6 and qPGWC-7, were located on, respectively, chromosomes 6 and 7. Comparisons were made between C-51 (a CSSL harbouring qPGWC-7 and having a chalky endosperm) and the recurrent parent 9311 (translucent endosperm) to characterize the physical and chemical differences between translucent and chalky endosperm. Unlike the translucent endosperm, the chalky endosperm contains loosely packed starch granules, and there were significant difference between C-51 and 9311 for amylopectin structure and degree of crystallinity, but not for either amylose content or starch viscosity.

66149173194	The vacuolar processing enzyme OsVPE1 is required for efficient glutelin processing in rice	Summary Rice (Oryza sativa L.) accumulates prolamines and glutelins as its major storage proteins. Glutelins are synthesized on rough endoplasmic reticulum as 57-kDa precursors; they are then sorted into protein storage vacuoles where they are processed into acidic and basic subunits. We report a novel rice glutelin mutant, W379, which accumulates higher levels of the 57-kDa glutelin precursor. Genetic analysis revealed that the W379 phenotype is controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene. Using a map-based cloning strategy, we identified this gene, OsVPE1, which is a homolog of the Arabidopsis βVPE gene. OsVPE1 encodes a 497-amino-acid polypeptide. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a missense mutation in W379 that changes Cys269 to Gly. Like the wild-type protein, the mutant protein is sorted into vacuoles; however, the enzymatic activity of the mutant OsVPE1 is almost completely eliminated. Further, we show that OsVPE1 is incorrectly cleaved, resulting in a mature protein that is smaller than the wild-type mature protein. Taken together, these results demonstrate that OsVPE1 is a cysteine protease that plays a crucial role in the maturation of rice glutelins. Further, OsVPE1 Cys269 is a key residue for maintaining the Asn-specific cleavage activity of OsVPE1. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Correlation analysis showed that there was a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.42 in 2005, and r = 0.35 in 2006, P<0.001) between TGW and PGWC in the BIL population. A total of 11 main-effect QTLs for TGW were identified, including 5 common QTLs in both years and 5 QTLs with significant QE effect. There were 8 pairs of epistatic effect for TGW, and 7 pairs of them with significant QE effect. Six main-effect QTLs and 9 epistatic effects for PGWC were identified, and 3 main-effect QTLs and 4 epistatic effects had QE effect. Three main-effect QTLs simultaneously controlled TGW and PGWC, and their alleles from the same parent increased TGW and PGWC. One epistatic effect had similar effects on both traits. Some main-effect QTLs, such as qTGW-3c, qTGW-4a, and qTGW-6b, only controlled TGW and could be used in breeding programs. © 2009 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

68949151974	Quantitative trait loci mapping and stability for low temperature germination ability of rice	A high rate of germination at low temperatures is necessary for economic yields to be maintained. In this paper, the genetic control of low temperature germination ability (LTG) was assessed by the measurement of germination rate (GR), germination rate index (GI) and mean germination time (MGT), and genetically mapped using a set of recombinant inbred lines, derived from a cross between the japonica cultivar 'Asominori' and the indica cultivar 'IR24'. Putative quantitative trait loci (QTL) were validated by testing in two related sets of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSL). In this genetic background, LTG is under the control of a number of QTL, each of relatively small effect, and is spread over six chromosomes. The most stable of these QTL was for GR, mapping to a segment of chromosome ll which also carries a QTL for GI. On chromosome 2, qGR-2 not only controlled GR, but also was associated with GI and MGT. Significant differences in LTG were detected between 'Asominori' and some CSSL harbouring qGR-2 or qGR-11. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.

70349970010	The distribution of Japonica rice cultivars in the lower region of the yangtze river valley is determined by its photoperiod-sensitivity and heading date genotypes	There are generally four recognized classes of japonica rice cultivars grown in the lower region of the Yangtze River valley. The geographical distribution of the four classes is latitude-dependent. Variation for heading date (HD) among 29 japonica rice cultivars grown in the lower region of the Yangtze River valley and belonging to the four classes was characterized, and their sensitivity to variations in photoperiod and temperature was analyzed. All of the cultivars were sensitive to both photoperiod and temperature. A regression analysis showed that HD is closely correlated with photoperiod sensitivity (PS). The PS of the four classes increased gradually from the medium maturing middle (MMM) types, through the late maturing middle (LMM) and early maturing late (EML) types to the medium maturing late (MML) types.

75549091421	Identification of glucose-responsive elements in the promoter of UDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis gene RHM1 in Arabidopsis thaliana	In plants, UDP-L-rhamnose is one of the major components of cell wall skeleton. Rhamnose synthase plays a key role in rhamnose synthesis which converts UDP-D-glucose into UDP-L-rhamnose in plants. In this study, we isolated the 1058 bp promoter region of the rhamnose synthase gene AtRHM1 from Arabidopsis genome by PCR, and created a series of deletions of AtRHM1 promoter ranging from -931 bp to +127 bp. The full length of the promoter and its deletion derivatives fused with GUS reporter gene were introduced into wild-type Arabidopsis by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation respectively. The GUS staining and GUS enzymatic activity assay showed that the expression of AtRHM1 is induced at transcriptional level by glucose and the regulatory elements involved in the glucose response are located in the region of -931 bp~-752 bp which contains three G-box motifs. © 2008 Institute of Microbiology, CAS & CSM, All rights reserved.

76149135999	Silencing induced by inverted repeat constructs in protoplasts of Nicotiana benthamiana	Double-stranded RNA interference can be used to silence gene expression in various organisms. Sustained RNAi-mediated gene silencing is typically triggered by hairpin RNAs (hpRNAs) generated by the transcription of inverted repeat (IR) DNA constructs. In this paper, we describe a transient expression assay that uses a green fluorescent protein marker gene (GFP) fused to the coat protein gene (CP) of papaya ring spot virus. This yields a nuclear and cytomembrane localized protein expression vector that can be used to monitor the silencing efficiency of inverted repeats. An ihpRNA was derived from a 215 nt IR segment of the 3′ end of the CP gene and recombined into the pHellsgate12 vector.

The objective of this study was to identify stably expressed quantitative trait loci (QTL) for FC. A total of 85 inbred lines derived from the backcross between Sasanishiki (japonica, as the recurrent parent) and Habataki (indica) were used to detect QTLs for rice fat content. Seven QTLs (denoted as qFC-1, qFC-2, qFC-3, qFC-6, qFC-10, qFC-11, and qFC-12) were detected on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6 10, 11, and 12, respectively, using inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) method. Among them, three major QTLs (qFC-3, qFC-6, and qFC-11) with large effect were further confirmed across two different environments using some chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs), where Habataki was used as the donor parent and Sasanishiki as the recurrent parent. Further experiments showed that one of the major QTLs (qFC-11) could increase fat content, fat index, and grain yield together. To our knowledge, qFC-11 is a newly detected stable QTL that will provide new opportunities for improving rice fat content through marker-assisted selection. © 2010 AACC International, Inc.

77951939082	A study of the in vitro protein digestibility of indica and japonica cultivars	Protein digestibility was determined in 18 indica and japonica raw milled rices using an in vitro pH-drop method with three- or four-enzyme system. Similar protein digestibility was found between indica and japonica rices, which is in agreement with the in vivo digestibilities in human. Cooking improved protein digestibility in the four-enzyme assay, while reducing agents exhibited apparent inhibition in multienzyme digestibility of indica and japonica rices. A significant correlation was detected between protein content and the estimates of digestibility, whereas no significant correlation was found between amylose content and digestibility estimates. SDS-PAGE analysis showed a significant difference in the degradation extent of prolamin between multienzyme and pepsin digestion, which might contribute to the inconsistence between results of this study and previous findings that in vitro protein digestibility of japonica rice was higher than that of indica rice. In addition, our results supported the previous report that waxy gene product level is not a major determinant of protein digestibility in milled rice. © 2010.

77955673890	DTH8 suppresses flowering in rice, influencing plant height and yield potential simultaneously	The three most important agronomic traits of rice (Oryza sativa), yield, plant height, and flowering time, are controlled by many quantitative trait loci (QTLs). In this study, a newly identified QTL, DTH8 (QTL for days to heading on chromosome 8), was found to regulate these three traits in rice. Map-based cloning reveals that DTH8 encodes a putative HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor and the complementary experiment increased significantly days to heading, plant height, and number of grains per panicle in CSSL61 (a chromosome segment substitution line that carries the nonfunctional DTH8 allele) with the Asominori functional DTH8 allele under long-day conditions. DTH8 is expressed in most tissues and its protein is localized to the nucleus exclusively. The quantitative real-time PCR assay revealed that DTH8 could down-regulate the transcriptions of Ehd1 (for Early heading date1) and Hd3a (for Heading date3a; a rice ortholog of FLOWERING LOCUS T) under long-day conditions. Ehd1 and Hd3a can also be down-regulated by the photoperiodic flowering genes Ghd7 and Hd1 (a rice ortholog of CONSTANS). Meanwhile, the transcription of DTH8 has been proved to be independent of Ghd7 and Hd1, and the natural mutation of this gene caused weak photoperiod sensitivity and shorter plant height. Taken together, these data indicate that DTH8 probably plays an important role in the signal network of photoperiodic flowering as a novel suppressor as well as in the regulation of plant height and yield potential.

77955119494	Difference of amylopectin structure among rice varieties differing in grain quality and its correlations with starch physicochemical properties	To explain the forming mechanism of taste quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.), the amylopectin structures of 50 rice varieties were characterized using improved fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis method that was based on DNA sequencer. The correlations between amylopectin structure and rice starch physicochemical properties were analyzed on the basis of eliminating the influence of amylose content (AC). The amylopectin structures in the 50 varieties were classified into type-I and type-II according to the chain ratio of ΣDP ≤ 11/ΣDP ≤ 24. The chain ratio of type-I amylopectin was smaller than 0.22, whereas the chains ratio of type-II amylopectin was greater than 0.26. Amylopectins of all the 15 japonica varieties belong to type-II, and those of indica varieties belong to type-I (15 varieties) and type-II (20 varieties). The ΣDP 6-11 and chain ratio of ΣDP ≤ 11/ΣDP ≤ 24 were negatively correlated (P < 0.01) with pasting temperature (PT) and relative crystallinity (RC). The ΣDP 28-34 had a negative correlation (P<0.01) with PT, but had no significant correlation with RC. The ΣDP 13-24 and ΣDP 39-49 were correlated with PT (P<0.01) and RC (P<0.05). The glutinous, low AC, and high AC varieties showed consistency to the total varieties in the correlations of ΣDP 6-11, ΣDP 28-34, and chain ratio of ΣDP ≤ 11/ΣDP ≤ 24 with PT and RC. Besides, the glutinous varieties were in agreement with the total varieties in the correlation between ΣDP 39-49 and PT; the low AC varieties in agreement with the total varieties in the correlation between ΣDP 28-34 and PT; and the high AC varieties had similar correlations between ΣDP 39-49 and PT and between ΣDP 39-49 and RC to the total varieties. The proportion of amylopectin chain was not correlated with gel consistency and Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA) profile properties despite of different amylopectin branch chain-length. Therefore, the amylopectin structure is mainly related to starch PT and RC in rice rather than GC and RVA profile properties. The short (DP 6-11), intermediate (DP 13-24), moderately long (DP 28-34), and long amylopectin chains (DP 39-49) might have functions on decreasing PT and RC, increasing PT and RC, decreasing PT, and increasing PT and RC of starch in rice grains, respectively. © 2010 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

77957346213	Transcriptomics Analysis Identified Candidate Genes Colocalized with Seed Dormancy QTLs in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Rice seed dormancy is an important trait related to the preharvest sprouting resistance of rice and is controlled by a polygene network. To identify the genes involved in this process, transcriptome analysis was applied to strong seed dormancy indica cultivar N22 and its weak dormancy mutant Q4646. The results showed that 280 genes were significantly upregulated and 244 genes significantly downregulated in the seed of Q4646 as compared to N22 during 25 to 28 days after heading. These genes were mainly involved in stress response, C-compound metabolism, plant development, DNA processing, and lipid metabolism. Some of these genes were colocalized with several reported dormancy QTLs, suggesting that they are possibly candidate genes underlying rice seed dormancy.

77957736597	Proper levels of the arabidopsis cohesion establishment factor CTF7 are essential for embryo and megagametophyte, but not endosperm, development	CTF7 is an essential gene in yeast that is required for the formation of sister chromatid cohesion. While recent studies have provided insights into how sister chromatid cohesion is established, less is known about how specifically CTF7 facilitates the formation of cohesion, and essentially nothing is known about how sister chromatid cohesion is established in plants. In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of CTF7 from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Arabidopsis CTF7 is similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTF7 in that it lacks an amino-terminal extension, exhibits acetyltransferase activity, and can complement a yeast ctf7 temperature-sensitive mutation. CTF7 transcripts are found throughout the plant, with the highest levels present in buds. Seeds containing T-DNA insertions in CTF7 exhibit mitotic defects in the zygote. Interestingly, the endosperm developed normally in ctf7 seeds, suggesting that CTF7 is not essential for mitosis in endosperm nuclei. Minor defects were observed in female gametophytes of ctf7

78649596748	OsRab5a regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells	Rice glutelins are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as precursors (pro-glutelins), and are transported to protein storage vacuoles, where they are processed into mature proteins. The molecular basis of this process is largely unknown. Here, we report the isolation of a rice mutant, gpa1, that accumulates 57 kDa pro-glutelins in seeds and whose endosperm has a floury appearance. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the gpa1 endosperm cells have an enlarged ER lumen and a smaller protein body II (PBII), and accumulated three types of newly generated subcellular structures. Moreover, a proportion of glutelins in the gpa1 endosperm cells were not delivered to PBII, and instead were mis-targeted to two of the newly generated structures or secreted. The gene corresponding to the gpa1 mutation was found to be OsRab5a, which encodes a small GTPase. In Arabidopsis protoplasts, OsRab5a protein was found to co-localize predominantly with AtVSR2, a molecular marker for the pre-vacuolar compartments (PVC). We conclude that OsRab5a plays an essential role in trafficking of storage protein to PBII, possibly as part of its function in organizing the endomembrane system in developing endosperm cells of rice.

78349244449	EMB1211 is required for normal embryo development and influences chloroplast biogenesis in Arabidopsis	Chloroplast biogenesis is tightly linked with embryogenesis and seedling development. A growing body of work has been done on the molecular mechanisms underlying chloroplast development; however, the molecular components involved in chloroplast biogenesis during embryogenesis remain largely uncharacterized. In this paper, we show that an Arabidopsis mutant carrying a T-DNA insertion in a gene encoding a multiple membrane occupation and recognition nexus (MORN)-containing protein exhibits severe defects during embryogenesis, producing abnormal embryos and thereby leading to a lethality of young seedlings. Genetic and microscopic studies reveal that the mutation is allelic to a previously designated Arabidopsis embryo-defective 1211 mutant (emb1211). The emb1211 +/- mutant plants produce approximately 25% of white-colored ovules with abnormal embryos since late globular stage when primary chloroplast biogenesis takes place, while the wild-type plants produce all green ovules. Transmission electron microscopic analysis reveals the absence of normal chloroplast development, both in the mutant embryos and in the mutant seedlings, that contributes to the albinism. The EMB1211 gene is preferentially expressed in developing embryos as revealed in the EMB1211::GUS transgenic plants. Taken together, the data indicate that EMB1211 has an important role during embryogenesis and chloroplast biogenesis in Arabidopsis. © Physiologia Plantarum 2010.

78650130728	Quantitative Trait Loci associated with resistance to rice stripe virus and small brown planthopper infestation in rice	Rice stripe is a serious viral disease of japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars in Asia. Resistance to this disease can be divided into that to rice stripe virus (RSV) and to the pest (small brown planthopper, SBPH). Here we have used a doubled-haploid (DH) population bred from the cross Zhaiyeqing8 (ZYQ8) × Jingxi17 (JX17) and four separate inoculation methods to genetically dissect the rice stripe resistance present in ZYQ8. Two linked RSV resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were located on chromosome 1, and one on chromosome 11, jointly explaining 30 to 44% of the trait variance. The main-effect qSTV11 was mapped close to the established RSV resistance gene Stvb-i. For resistance to SBPH, three QTLs were located, mapping to chromosomes 1, 2, and 11, and jointly explaining 44 to 51% of the trait variance. The large-effect qSBPH1 appears to be a novel QTL conferring a degree of tolerance and antibiosis against SBPH. The positive alleles at all six QTLs were present in ZYQ8. Analysis of a set of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) in which chromosomal segments of various indica varieties were present in a japonica background showed that rice stripe resistance genes/QTLs are common on the long arm of chromosome 1. © Crop Science Society of America.

This set was developed by marker aided selection, based on 136 SSR and in/del markers. The introgressed chromosomal segments presented in the 108 CSSLs covered 98.3% of the cultivar C418 genome. The CSSL set was used to genetically analyze variation for 1000-grain weight (TGW) and related traits in two contrasting environments, and led to the identification of 41 quantitative trait loci (QTLs), five of which were expressed in both environments. More detailed mapping of qTGW7 showed that it is cosegregated with RM22034 on the short arm of chromosome 7. The CSSLs varied phenotypically with respect to a number of agronomic traits besides TGW. CSSL populations would be effective in identifying QTLs for these various traits, and could provide germplasm relevant for crop improvement.

As hybrid sterility is caused by an allelic interaction at a small number of loci, it is possible to overcome it by simple introgression at the major sterility loci. Here we report the use of marker-assisted backcrossing to transfer into the elite japonica cv. Zhendao88 a photoperiod-sensitive male sterility gene from cv. Lunhui422S (indica) and the yellow leaf gene from line Yellow249 (indica). The microsatellite markers RM276, RM455, RM141 and RM185 were used to tag the fertility genes S5, S8, S7 and S9, respectively. Line 509S is a true-breeding photoperiod-sensitive male sterile plant, which morphologically closely resembles the japonica type. Genotypic analysis showed that the genome of line 509S comprises about 92% japonica DNA. Nevertheless, hybrids between line 509S and japonica varieties suffer from a level of hybrid sterility, although the line is highly cross-compatible with indica types, with the resulting hybrids expressing a significant degree of heterosis. Together, these results suggest that segment substitution on fertility loci based on known information and marker-assisted selection are an effective approach for utilizing the heterosis of rice inter-subspecies. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

79953074868	Nitric oxide production is associated with response to brown planthopper infestation in rice	Nilaparvata lugens Stål, the brown planthopper (BPH), is one of the most destructive phloem-feeding insects of rice (Oryza sativa L.) throughout Asia. Here, we show that BPH feeding increases the level of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) in the leaf and sheath tissue of both resistant and susceptible rice cultivars. However, in the roots, the NO level increased in the resistant cultivar, but decreased in the susceptible one. A burst of NO production occurred in the sheath within 1. h of infestation with BPH. The production of NO in response to BPH feeding appears to be dependent primarily on the activity of nitric oxide synthase. The application of exogenous NO reduced plant water loss by its effect on both stomatal opening and root architecture. It also stimulated the expression of certain drought stress-related genes, reduced plant height and delayed leaf senescence. Over the short term, NO supplementation reduced the seedling mortality caused by BPH feeding. This suggests that NO signaling plays a role in the rice tolerance response to BPH feeding. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

79953279631	Heading date QTL in rice derived from an analysis of chromosome segment substitution lines	The inheritance of heading date (HD) in rice was investigated using a set of lines in which chromosome segments of the photoperiod- and temperature-sensitive male sterile line Peiai 64S had been incorporated into a genetic background of the cv. 9311. The flowering time of each line was contrasted with that of cv. 9311 in four distinct environments: natural long days (13.2-14.2h photoperiod) and artificially shortened days (9h photoperiod) at Nanjing; and natural (low) temperature and enhanced temperature at Hainan. A set of 21 heading date quantitative trait loci (QTL) was identified, covering eight of the 12 rice chromosomes, and their dependence on photoperiod and/or temperature was characterized. Two of the QTL were photoperiod-sensitive, and eight were insensitive; while two were temperature-sensitive and four insensitive; the remaining five QTL were independent of both temperature and photoperiod.

79957891525	QTL mapping for resistance to strip virus disease in rice	To discover new resistance genes to rice stripe virus disease (RSVD), quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis was conducted by using 162 recombinant inbred lines, derived from a cross between 'Guichao 2' and 'Koshihikari', RSVD resistances were evaluated using both artificial inoculation and natural infection methods by scoring the ratio of the disease rating index. Three QTL-controlling RSVD resistance were detected by the above two methods, which located on chromosomes 4(qStv4), 9(qStv9) and 12(qStv12), respectively. The qStv9 and qStv12 was repeatedly detected in artificial inoculation test in 2006 and 2008. In natural inoculation test, the qStv4 and qStv9 was detected in 2006, and the qStv12 was detected in 2008. As qStv9 and qStv12 explained 11.3-32.1% of the resistance effect from 'Guichao 2' across two environments, they should be a useful genetic resource in rice MAS breeding programme against RSVD. Further analysis revealed that the lines harbouring the alleles of qStv9 and qStv12 exhibited significantly increased resistance to RSVD, implying the possibility of breeding new resistant varieties by pyramiding resistant QTL through marker-assisted selection. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

The trait is closely related to seed dormancy, for which there is known genetic variation in rice and other cereals. A set of 122 back-cross-inbred lines from the cross of 'N22' (indica, strongly dormant) and 'Nanjing 35' (japonica, no-dormant) were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seed dormancy.

We previously showed a major quantitative trait locus for the percentage of grains with white chalkiness (QTLqPGWC-8) in the interval G1149-R727 on chromosome 8 using a chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL). Here, we selected the line-CSSL50 harboring the QTLqPGWC-8 allele from the CSSLs derived from a cross between Asominori (as a recurrent parent) and IR24 (as a donor parent), which had higher percentage chalkiness, markedly different from that of Asominori.

79961184948	Double repression of soluble starch synthase genes SSIIa and SSIIIa in rice (Oryza sativa L.) uncovers interactive effects on the physicochemical properties of starch	Soluble starch synthases (SSs) are major enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis in developing rice (Oryza sativa L.) endosperm. Despite extensive studies of SSs in various plant species including rice, the functional modes of action among multiple SS genes are still not clear. Here, we generated transgenic RNA interference (RNAi) repressed lines for seven of the eight members of the rice SS gene family and studied their effects on starch synthesis and grain formation. Consistent with their expression domains, RNAi repression of genes that encode isozymes SSI, SSIIa, and SSIIIa had strong effects on grain development, whereas no obvious phenotypic changes were observed in transgenic plants with the other SS genes being RNAi repressed, indicating functional redundancies among the genes. To study the potential functional interactions of SS genes, we generated SSIIa/SSIIIa double repression lines whose kernels displayed a chalky kernel appearance and had increased amylose levels, increased pasting temperatures, and decreased viscosities. The double mutation also reduced short (degree of polymerization (DP) 5-6) and long (DP 12-23) amylopectin chain contents in the grain and increased the medium long types (DP 7-11). The nonadditive nature of the double mutation line suggests that SSIIa and SSIIIa interact with each other during starch synthesis. Such interaction may be physical via starch phophorylase as indicated by our pair-wise yeast two-hybrid assays on major starch synthesis enzymes. Collectively, the data showed that SSIIa and SSIIIa play distinctive, but partially overlapping, roles during rice grain starch synthesis. The possibility of extensive redundancy or complementarity among SS isozymes is discussed. © 2011 Published by NRC Research Press.

Marker-assisted selection (MAS) was applied to select derivatives carrying one or both of qSdn-1 and qSdn-5 in a genetic background which was nearly isogenic to Nanjing35. An analysis of dormancy in the BC4F2 population allowed qSdn-1 to be located between the simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers RM11669 and RM1216; the QTL explained 24. 58% of the overall phenotypic variation and the most closely linked marker was RM11694. qSdn-5 was mapped between RM480 and RM3664, and explained 17. 58% of the overall phenotypic variation. The SSR locus RM19080 mapped within 0. 4 cM of qSdn-5. No epistasis was observed between qSdn-1 and qSdn-5. The mean germination rates of lines containing qSdn-1, qSdn-5 and both qSdn-1 and qSdn-5 were 7. 9, 11. 1 and 6. 1%, respectively, whereas that of the check line lacking both QTL was 86. 3%. The SSR loci linked most tightly to qSdn-1 and qSdn-5 are suitable for MAS for reduced pre-harvest sprouting in rice. The dormancy of both qSdn-1 and qSdn-5 could be readily broken by a 7-day post-harvest treatment at 50°C. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84555188539	The failure to express a protein disulphide isomerase-like protein results in a floury endosperm and an endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice	The rice somaclonal mutant T3612 produces small grains with a floury endosperm, caused by the loose packing of starch granules. The positional cloning of the mutation revealed a deletion in a gene encoding a protein disulphide isomerase-like enzyme (PDIL1-1). In the wild type, PDIL1-1 was expressed throughout the plant, but most intensely in the developing grain. In T3612, its expression was abolished, resulting in a decrease in the activity of plastidial phosphorylase and pullulanase, and an increase in that of soluble starch synthase I and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. The amylopectin in the T3612 endosperm showed an increase in chains with a degree of polymerization 8-13 compared with the wild type. The expression in the mutant's endosperm of certain endoplasmic reticulum stress-responsive genes was noticeably elevated. PDIL1-1 appears to play an important role in starch synthesis. Its absence is associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress in the endosperm, which is likely to underlie the formation of the floury endosperm in the T3612 mutant. © 2011 The Author(s).

84856714980	A new gene controlling hybrid sterility in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Hybrids between rice subspecies indica and japonica display strong heterosis. However, semi-sterility of inter-subspecific hybrids between indica and japonica varieties is a major obstacle for application of hybrid vigor in rice production. Semisterility was previously ascribed to allelic interaction at a number of different loci, whereas, wide-compatibility varieties can overcome hybrid sterility. Variety Nekken 2, which is a source of wide compatibility genes, showed sterility when crossed to the Korean variety Yeong Pung. Genetic and cytological analyses revealed that the semi-sterility was caused by partial abortion of the embryo sac. Genome-wide analysis of the backcross population, Nekken 2/Yeong Pung//Nekken 2 identified two independent loci for hybrid sterility on chromosomes 1 and 12, explaining 18.99 and 18.03% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. To confirm this result, another population of the same backcross containing 216 individuals was tested at a different site in a different year. The locus on chromosome 12 was detected again. Based on the study, the stable QTL on chromosome 12 appeared to be different from previously reported genes for this trait, and was designated as S35(t). © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84860551750	Disruption of a rice pentatricopeptide repeat protein causes a seedling-specific albino phenotype and its utilization to enhance seed purity in hybrid rice production	The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) gene family represents one of the largest gene families in higher plants. Accumulating data suggest that PPR proteins play a central and broad role in modulating the expression of organellar genes in plants. Here we report a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant named young seedling albino (ysa) derived from the rice thermo/photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile line Pei'ai64S, which is a leading male-sterile line for commercial two-line hybrid rice production. The ysa mutant develops albino leaves before the three-leaf stage, but the mutant gradually turns green and recovers to normal green at the sixleaf stage. Further investigation showed that the change in leaf color in ysa mutant is associated with changes in chlorophyll content and chloroplast development. Map-based cloning revealed that YSA encodes a PPR protein with 16 tandem PPR motifs. YSA is highly expressed in young leaves and stems, and its expression level is regulated by light. We showed that the ysa mutation has no apparent negative effects on several important agronomic traits, such as fertility, stigma extrusion rate, selfed seed-setting rate, hybrid seed-setting rate, and yield heterosis under normal growth conditions. We further demonstrated that ysa can be used as an early marker for efficient identification and elimination of false hybrids in commercial hybrid rice production, resulting in yield increases by up to approximately 537 kg ha

84862490160	Identification of novel MiRNAs and MiRNA expression profiling during grain development in indica rice	Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate gene expression in different tissues and at diverse developmental stages, including grain development in japonica rice. To identify novel miRNAs in indica rice and to study their expression patterns during the entire grain filling process, small RNAs from all stages of grain development were sequenced and their expression patterns were studied using customized miRNA chips.Results: A total of 21 conserved and 91 non-conserved miRNA families were found in developing indica grains. We also discovered 11 potential novel miRNAs based on the presence of their miRNA*s. Expression patterns of these identified miRNAs were analyzed using customized miRNA chips. The results showed that during the filling phase about half of the detected miRNAs were up-regulated, whereas the remainder were down-regulated. Predicted targets of differentially expressed miRNAs may participate in carbohydrate metabolism, hormone signaling and pathways associated with seed maturity, suggesting potentially important roles in rice grain development.Conclusions: This study is the first genome-wide investigation of miRNAs during the grain-filling phase of an indica variety of rice. The novel miRNAs identified might be involved in new miRNA regulatory pathways for grain development. The complexity of these miRNAs and their targets and interactions require further study to obtain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying grain development. © 2012 Lan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Three FC QTLs were identified from an analysis of a set of rice 'Kasalath'/'Koshihikari' backcross inbred lines, which were grown in three independent environments. Two of these QTLs (qFC7.1 and qFC7.2) were located on chromosome 7, and they were detected in all three environments. The presence of qFC7.1 and qFC7.2 was further confirmed by testing a set of 'Kasalath' (donor) / 'Koshihikari' (recipient) chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) across six environments. Both QTLs significantly increased grain FC and they might be involved in lipid metabolism. The two QTLs were stably expressed in a number of environments and populations, making them suitable candidates for the improvement of FC via marker assisted breeding. © 2012 Published by NRC Research Press.

A total of 11 traits (or parameters) were analyzed, including percentage of grains with chalkiness (PGWC), protein content (PC) and protein index (PI), and eight parameters from the viscosity profile. PGWC, PC and PI were significantly correlated with the paste viscosity parameters. We identified 39 QTLs in three environments; ten QTL clusters emerged. Eight QTLs were consistently detected across the three environments and further confirmed using a set of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) where Kasalath was used as the donor parent and Koshihikari as the recurrent parent. One and two major clusters on chromosome 6 corresponded to the Wx and Alk loci, respectively. The former was responsible for PGWC and most of the viscosity parameters, and the latter for PI and some viscosity parameters. Particularly, QTL qPI-6.1 was linked with both the Wx and Alk loci. The co-locations of QTLs for PGWC and viscosity parameters and the linkage of qPI-6.1 and qBDV-6 at the Wx locus could be largely responsible for the phenotypic correlations between these traits. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

CSSL1 were a series of IR24 chromosome segment substitution lines in Asominori background, and CSSL2 were a series of introgression lines of Asominori in the background of IR24. Three QTL were detected on chromosome 3,6 and 9 in RIL population, and individual QTL accounted for between 12.3% and 13%. Three QTL were detected on chromosome 1,3 and 7 in CSSL1, and individual QTL accounted for between 11.5% and 18.9%. Three QTL were detected on chromosome 1,2 and 7 in CSSL2, and individual QTL accounted for between 11% and 16%. The QTLs on chromosome 1 and 7 were detected in CSSL1 and CSSL2 populations simultaneously, QTL came from Asomonori, the moderate dormant cultivar, increased seed dormancy, and QTL from IR24, the weakly dormant cultivar, decreased seed dormancy.

0038376472	Screening and genetic analysis of rice glutelin mutant	The contribution of rice as a protein source is important. Rice seed protein can be divided into four forms, glutelin (57 kDa, 37-39 kDa, 22-23 kDa), prolamine (13 kDa), albumin (16 kDa) and globulin (10 kDa, 26 kDa) on its solubility. Glutelin is the major storage protein of rice and accounted for 80% of total protein found in the rice grain, the mature glutelin comprises an acidic (37-39 kDa) and an basic subunit (22-23 kDa) coming from a common precursor (57 kDa) by post-transcriptional hydrolytic cleavage. Prolamine is the second important. Rice seed proteins localize in two types of protein bodies, PB - I, PB - II. PB - I containing prolamine is indigestible, whereas PB - II being rich in glutelin is digestible. The nutritional value of rice could thus be raised by improving its digestible protein glutelin content. On the other hand, the character of low digestible protein is also an important target of rice breeding. Low protein rice is required for the diet of patients with kidney disease. Three glutelin mutants, W3660, W204, W379, were found by screening 168 rice varieties through SDS-PAGE analysis of the seeds total proteins. The amounts of 37-39 kDa and 22-23 kDa glutelin subunits were much lower and that of 13 kDa prolamine polypeptide was higher in W3660 seeds than in ordinary rice; The amounts of 37-39 kDa and 22-23 kDa glutelin subunits in W204 or W379 seeds were between those in W3660 and ordinary rice. Especially, in W379 seed, there was a large quantity of 57 kDa polypeptide. For characterizing the genetics of the glutelin mutant, the cross population between W3660 and Otorokimochi was constructed.

Germination rate was used as the phenotype of seed storability under room temperature conditions after storage for 32months (grown only at Nanjing) and 48months (grown at Nanjing, Jinhu and Lianyungang).

84871882077	Identification and characterization of an Epi-allele of FIE1 reveals a regulatory linkage between two epigenetic marks in rice	DNA methylation and histone H3 Lys 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) are important epigenetic repression marks for silencing transposons in heterochromatin and for regulating gene expression. However, the mechanistic relationship to other repressive marks, such as histone H3 Lys 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is unclear. FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM1 (FIE1) encodes an Esc-like core component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2, which is involved in H3K27me3-mediated gene repression. Here, we identify a gain-of-function epi-allele (Epi-df) of rice (Oryza sativa) FIE1; this allele causes a dwarf stature and various floral defects that are inherited in a dominant fashion. We found that Epi-df has no changes in nucleotide sequence but is hypomethylated in the 59 region of FIE1 and has reduced H3K9me2 and increased H3K4me3. In Epi-df, FIE1 was ectopically expressed and its imprinting was disrupted. FIE1 interacted with rice Enhancer of Zeste homologs, consistent with its role in H3K27me3 repression. Ectopic expression of FIE1 in Epi-df resulted in alteration of H3K27me3 levels in hundreds of genes. In summary, this work identifies an epi-allele involved in H3K27me3-mediated gene repression that itself is highly regulated by DNA methylation and histone H3K9me2, thereby shedding light on the link between DNA methylation and histone methylation, the two important epigenetic marks regulating rice development. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

84872452400	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice	Nitrogen is a crucial nutrient for plant growth and development. Arginine is considered to be an important amino acid for nitrogen transport and storage, playing a crucial role during plant seedling development. However, little is known about the role of arginine in nitrogen remobilization at the reproductive stage. We isolated a rice mutant nglf-1 with reduced plant height, small panicle and grain size, and low seed-setting rate (10% in nglf-1 compared to 93% in wild-type). Map-based cloning revealed that the mutant phenotype was caused by loss of function of a gene (OsARG) encoding an arginine hydrolysis enzyme, which is consistent with arginine accumulation in the mutant. The phenotype was partially corrected supplying exogenous nitrogen, and fully corrected by expression of a wild-type OsARG transgene. Over-expression of OsARG in rice (cv. Kitaake) increased grain number per plant under nitrogen-limited conditions. OsARG was ubiquitously expressed in various organs, but most strongly in developing panicles. The OsARG protein was localized in the mitochondria, consistent with other arginases. Our results suggest that the arginase encoded by OsARG, a key enzyme in Arg catabolism, plays a critical role during panicle development, especially under conditions of insufficient exogenous nitrogen. OsARG is a potential target for crop improvement. © 2012 The Authors. The Plant Journal © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84873257385	The mitochondrial folylpolyglutamate synthetase gene is required for nitrogen utilization during early seedling development in arabidopsis	Investigations into the biochemical processes and regulatory mechanisms of nitrogen (N) utilization can aid in understanding how N is used efficiently in plants. This report describes a deficiency in N utilization in an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transfer DNA insertion mutant of the mitochondrial folylpolyglutamate synthetase gene DFC, which catalyzes the conjugation of glutamate residues to the tetrahydrofolate during folate synthesis. The mutant seedlings displayed several metabolic changes that are typical of plant responses to low-N stress, including increased levels of starch and anthocyanin synthesis as well as decreased levels of soluble protein and free amino acid, as compared with those in wild-type seedlings when external N was sufficient. More striking changes were observed when dfc seedlings were grown under N-limited conditions, including shorter primary roots, fewer lateral roots, higher levels of glycine and carbon-N ratios, and lower N content than those in wild-type seedlings. Gene expression studies in mutant seedlings revealed altered transcript levels of several genes involved in folate biosynthesis and N metabolism. The biochemical and metabolic changes also suggested that N assimilation is drastically perturbed due to a loss of DFC function. The observation that elevated CO

In order to identify the BPH resistance gene in Balamawee, an F2 population was derived by crossing Balamawee and susceptible japonica cultivar 02428. A single major resistance gene was identified and mapped to the long arm of chromosome 4. Further recombination analysis showed that the gene was located in an interval of about 63 kb between InDel markers Q52 and Q20. This new BPH resistance locus was designated Bph27(t). © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84874258756	Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia	Flowering time (i.e., heading date in crops) is an important ecological trait that determines growing seasons and regional adaptability of plants to specific natural environments. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a short-day plant that originated in the tropics. Increasing evidence suggests that the northward expansion of cultivated rice was accompanied by human selection of the heading date under noninductive long-day (LD) conditions. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of DTH2 (for Days to heading on chromosome 2), a minor-effect quantitative trait locus that promotes heading under LD conditions. We show that DTH2 encodes a CONSTANS-like protein that promotes heading by inducing the florigen genes Heading date 3a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1, and it acts independently of the known floral integrators Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1. Moreover, association analysis and transgenic experiments identified two functional nucleotide polymorphisms in DTH2 that correlated with early heading and increased reproductive fitness under natural LD conditions in northern Asia. Our combined population genetics and network analyses suggest that DTH2 likely represents a target of human selection for adaptation to LD conditions during rice domestication and/or improvement, demonstrating an important role of minor-effect quantitative trait loci in crop adaptation and breeding.

84874786199	Ehd4 Encodes a Novel and Oryza-Genus-Specific Regulator of Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice	Land plants have evolved increasingly complex regulatory modes of their flowering time (or heading date in crops). Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a short-day plant that flowers more rapidly in short-day but delays under long-day conditions. Previous studies have shown that the CO-FT module initially identified in long-day plants (Arabidopsis) is evolutionary conserved in short-day plants (Hd1-Hd3a in rice). However, in rice, there is a unique Ehd1-dependent flowering pathway that is Hd1-independent. Here, we report isolation and characterization of a positive regulator of Ehd1, Early heading date 4 (Ehd4). ehd4 mutants showed a never flowering phenotype under natural long-day conditions. Map-based cloning revealed that Ehd4 encodes a novel CCCH-type zinc finger protein, which is localized to the nucleus and is able to bind to nucleic acids in vitro and transactivate transcription in yeast, suggesting that it likely functions as a transcriptional regulator. Ehd4 expression is most active in young leaves with a diurnal expression pattern similar to that of Ehd1 under both short-day and long-day conditions. We show that Ehd4 up-regulates the expression of the "florigen" genes Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1, but it acts independently of other known Ehd1 regulators. Strikingly, Ehd4 is highly conserved in the Oryza genus including wild and cultivated rice, but has no homologs in other species, suggesting that Ehd4 is originated along with the diversification of the Oryza genus from the grass family during evolution. We conclude that Ehd4 is a novel Oryza-genus-specific regulator of Ehd1, and it plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice. © 2013 Gao et al.

84877055181	Detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistances to small brown planthopper and rice stripe virus in rice using recombinant inbred lines	Small brown planthopper (SBPH) and rice stripe virus (RSV) disease transmitted by SBPH cause serious damage to rice (Oryza sativa L.) in China. In the present study, we screened 312 rice accessions for resistance to SBPH. The indica variety, N22, is highly resistant to SBPH. One hundred and eighty two recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross of N22 and the highly susceptible variety, USSR5, were used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of resistances to SBPH and RSV. In a modified seedbox screening test, three QTLs for SBPH resistance, qSBPH2, qSBPH3 and qSBPH7.1, were mapped on chromosomes 2, 3 and 7, a total explaining 35.1% of the phenotypic variance. qSBPH7.2 and qSBPH11.2, conferring antibiosis against SBPH, were detected on chromosomes 7 and 11 and accounted for 20.7% of the total phenotypic variance. In addition, qSBPH5 and qSBPH7.3, expressing antixenosis to SBPH, were detected on chromosomes 5 and 7, explaining 23.9% of the phenotypic variance. qSBPH7.1, qSBPH7.2 and qSBPH7.3, located in the same region between RM234 and RM429 on chromosome 7, using three different phenotyping methods indicate that the locus or region plays a major role in conferring resistance to SBPH in N22. Moreover, three QTLs, qSTV4, qSTV11.1 and qSTV11.2, for RSV resistance were detected on chromosomes 4 and 11. qSTV11.1 and qSTV11.2 are located in the same region between RM287 and RM209 on chromosome 11. Molecular markers spanning these QTLs should be useful in the development of varieties with resistance to SBPH and RSV. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84880989890	A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants	The plastidic caseinolytic protease (Clp) of higher plants is an evolutionarily conserved protein degradation apparatus composed of a proteolytic core complex (the P and R rings) and a set of accessory proteins (ClpT, ClpC, and ClpS). The role and molecular composition of Clps in higher plants has just begun to be unraveled, mostly from studies with the model dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In this work, we isolated a virescent yellow leaf (vyl) mutant in rice (Oryza sativa), which produces chlorotic leaves throughout the entire growth period. The young chlorotic leaves turn green in later developmental stages, accompanied by alterations in chlorophyll accumulation, chloroplast ultrastructure, and the expression of chloroplast development and photosynthesis-related genes. Positional cloning revealed that the VYL gene encodes a protein homologous to the Arabidopsis ClpP6 subunit and that it is targeted to the chloroplast. VYL expression is constitutive in most tissues examined but most abundant in leaf sections containing chloroplasts in early stages of development. The mutation in vyl causes premature termination of the predicted gene product and loss of the conserved catalytic triad (serine-histidine-aspartate) and the polypeptide-binding site of VYL. Using a tandem affinity purification approach and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified OsClpP4 as a VYL-associated protein in vivo. In addition, yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that VYL directly interacts with OsClpP3 and OsClpP4. Furthermore, we found that OsClpP3 directly interacts with OsClpT, that OsClpP4 directly interacts with OsClpP5 and OsClpT, and that both OsClpP4 and OsClpT can homodimerize. Together, our data provide new insights into the function, assembly, and regulation of Clps in higher plants. © 2013 American Society of Plant Biologists. All Rights Reserved.

84881077945	Molecular genetic characterization of rice seed lipoxygenase 3 and assessment of its effects on seed longevity	Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are enzymes involved in lipid peroxidation. Here we reported the identification, molecular and functional characterization of the gene encoding rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed LOX3 (sLOX3). Via a map-based cloning strategy we identified Os03g0700400 as the candidate gene encoding sLOX3. Further functional complementary test and biochemical characterization of the recombinant Os03g0700400 protein verified the identification. The sLOX3 gene was highly expressed in roots, moderately in embryos and very weakly in leaves, leaf sheaths and stems. Transient expression experiment (in rice protoplasts) and subsequent laser confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that the sLOX3 protein was localized into the cytosol. We next showed that overexpression of sLOX3 in a japonica sLOX3-normal rice cultivar, Wuyunjing 7 accelerated the decrease of seed germination ability when the seeds were routinely stored, which demonstrated that sLOX3 had a negative effect on seed longevity (storability). Meanwhile, an increased occurrence of embryo decay was observed in the same transgenic seeds, suggesting that sLOX3 might negatively affect seed longevity by facilitating colonization of particular seed pathogens. Our result forwarded the understanding of the effects of 9-LOX on rice seed longevity. © 2013 Korean Society of Plant Biologists and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84883220701	qLTG-9, a stable quantitative trait locus for low-temperature germination in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Low-temperature germination (LTG) is an important agronomic trait for direct seeding of rice in temperate regions of East Asia. To dissect the genetic control of LTG, we constructed a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross of japonica variety USSR5 and indica variety N22. Three putative QTL involved in LTG were detected and named qLTG-7, qLTG-9 and qLTG-12. They explained 9.5, 12.12 and 7.08 % of the phenotypic variation, respectively, and the alleles from USSR5 enhanced LTG. A set of advanced backcross lines selected for the presence of qLTG-9 (with the biggest contribution of the three QTL), by both linked markers and phenotype, was used to validate qLTG-9 in different generations, years and locations. A near-isogenic line in USSR5 background with a qLTG-9 insertion from N22 had retarded germination under low-temperature conditions. Finally, qLTG-9 was fine mapped between markers L9-25D and ID-1, to a 72.3-kb region in chromosome 9, which in the Nipponbare genome contains five predicted genes. This result provides a springboard for map-based cloning of qLTG-9 and is helpful in understanding the mechanism of seed germination under low-temperature conditions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84883167521	Folate polyglutamylation is involved in chromatin silencing by maintaining global DNA methylation and histone H3K9 dimethylation in Arabidopsis	DNA methylation and repressive histone Histone3 Lysine9 (H3K9) dimethylation correlate with chromatin silencing in plants and mammals. To identify factors required for DNA methylation and H3K9 dimethylation, we screened for suppressors of the repressor of silencing1 (ros1) mutation, which causes silencing of the expression of the RD29A (RESPONSE TO DESSICATION 29A) promoter-driven luciferase transgene (RD29A-LUC) and the 35S promoter-driven NPTII (NEOMYCIN PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE II) transgene (35S-NPTII). We identified the folylpolyglutamate synthetase FPGS1 and the known factor DECREASED DNAMETHYLATION1 (DDM1). The fpgs1 and ddm1 mutations release the silencing of both RD29A-LUC and 35S-NPTII. Genome-wide analysis indicated that the fpgs1 mutation reduces DNAmethylation and releases chromatin silencing at a genome-wide scale. The effect of fpgs1 on chromatin silencing is correlated with reduced levels of DNA methylation and H3K9 dimethylation. Supplementation of fpgs1 mutants with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, a stable form of folate, rescues the defects in DNA methylation, histone H3K9 dimethylation, and chromatin silencing. The competitive inhibitor of methyltransferases, S-adenosylhomocysteine, is markedly upregulated in fpgs1, by which fpgs1 reduces S-adenosylmethionine accessibility to methyltransferases and accordingly affects DNA and histone methylation. These results suggest that FPGS1-mediated folate polyglutamylation is required for DNA methylation and H3K9 dimethylation through its function in one-carbon metabolism.

84885373147	A Role for a Dioxygenase in Auxin Metabolism and Reproductive Development in Rice	Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the natural auxin in plants, regulates many aspects of plant growth and development. Extensive analyses have elucidated the components of auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling, but the physiological roles and molecular mechanisms of auxin degradation remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the dioxygenase for auxin oxidation (DAO) gene, encoding a putative 2-oxoglutarate-dependent-Fe (II) dioxygenase, is essential for anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed initiation in rice. Rice mutant lines lacking a functional DAO display increased levels of free IAA in anthers andovaries. Furthermore, exogenous application of IAA or overexpression of the auxin biosynthesis gene OsYUCCA1 phenocopies the dao mutants. We show that recombinant DAO converts the active IAA into biologically inactive 2-oxoindole-3-acetic acid (OxIAA) invitro. Collectively, these data support a key role of DAO in auxin catabolism and maintenance of auxin homeostasis central to plant reproductive development. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84887017825	An allotetraploid Brassica napus early-flowering mutant has BnaFLC2-regulated flowering	BACKGROUND: Flowering time is an important agronomic trait, and wide variation in flowering time exists among Brassica napus accessions. GX50 early-flowering mutant, induced from Brassica napus by Ethyl Methane Sulfonate (EMS), exhibits a remarkable early transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. RESULTS: GX50 plants flowered about 60 days earlier than the control wild-type plant B. napus XY15 under greenhouse conditions. Cytological examination revealed that the GX50 plants form inflorescences as early as from 5 weeks old, flower primordium from 6 weeks old, and siliques from 10 weeks old, whereas 10-week-old XY15 plants are still at vegetative growth stage. To unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the GX50 flowering phenotype, we analyzed the expression of several key regulatory genes. Expressions of all five BnaFLCs (BnaFLC1 to BnaFLC5), BnaFT and BnaSOC1 were detected. Interestingly, BnaFLCs expression levels were lower in GX50 than those in XY15. Among the five BnaFLCs, only the expression pattern of BnaFLC2 corresponded to the timing of floral organ differentiation in GX50. In agreement with previous knowledge that BnaFLCs repress expression of BnaFT and BnaSOC1, increased levels of BnaFT and BnaSOC1 were observed in GX50 compared with XY15. CONCLUSION: BnaFLC2, but not the other BnaFLC genes, plays an important role in B. napus GX50 floral transition. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.

84887056713	A comprehensive genetic study reveals a crucial role of CYP90D2/D2 in regulating plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa)	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are essential regulators of plant architecture. Understanding how BRs control plant height and leaf angle would facilitate development of new plant type varieties by biotechnology. A number of mutants involved in BR biosynthesis have been isolated but many of them lack detailed genetic analysis. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a severe dwarf mutant, chromosome segment deleted dwarf 1 (csdd1), which was deficient in BR biosynthesis in rice. We isolated the mutant by screening a tissue culture-derived population, cloned the gene by mapping, and confirmed its function by complementary and RNAi experiments, combined with physiological and chemical analysis. We showed that the severe dwarf phenotype was caused by a complete deletion of a cytochrome P450 gene, CYP90D2/D2, which was further confirmed in two independent T-DNA insertion lines in different genetic backgrounds and by RNA interference. Our chemical analysis suggested that CYP90D2/D2 might catalyze C-3 dehydrogenation step in BR biosynthesis. We have demonstrated that the CYP90D2/D2 gene plays a more important role than previously reported. Allelic mutations of CYP90D2/D2 confer varying degrees of dwarfism and leaf angle, thus providing useful information for molecular breeding in grain crop plants. © 2013 New Phytologist Trust.

84890492360	D14-SCF D3 -dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling	Strigolactones (SLs), a newly discovered class of carotenoid-derived phytohormones, are essential for developmental processes that shape plant architecture and interactions with parasitic weeds and symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Despite the rapid progress in elucidating the SL biosynthetic pathway, the perception and signalling mechanisms of SL remain poorly understood. Here we show that DWARF 53 (D53) acts as a repressor of SL signalling and that SLs induce its degradation. We find that the rice (Oryza sativa) d53 mutant, which produces an exaggerated number of tillers compared to wild-type plants, is caused by a gain-of-function mutation and is insensitive to exogenous SL treatment. The D53 gene product shares predicted features with the class I Clp ATPase proteins and can form a complex with the α/β hydrolase protein DWARF 14 (D14) and the F-box protein DWARF 3 (D3), two previously identified signalling components potentially responsible for SL perception. We demonstrate that, in a D14- and D3-dependent manner, SLs induce D53 degradation by the proteasome and abrogate its activity in promoting axillary bud outgrowth. Our combined genetic and biochemical data reveal that D53 acts as a repressor of the SL signalling pathway, whose hormone-induced degradation represents a key molecular link between SL perception and responses. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84891914635	OsVPS9A functions cooperatively with OsRAB5A to regulate post-golgi dense vesicle-mediated storage protein trafficking to the protein storage vacuole in rice endosperm cells	In the rice endosperm cells, glutelins are synthesized on rough endoplasmic reticulum as proglutelins and are sorted to the protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) called protein body IIs (PBIIs), where they are converted to the mature forms. Dense vesicle (DV)-mediated trafficking of proglutelins in rice seeds has been proposed, but the post-Golgi control of this process is largely unknown. Whether DV can fuse directly with PSV is another matter of debate. In this study, we propose a regulatory mechanism underlying DV-mediated, post-Golgi proglutelin trafficking to PBII (PSV). gpa2, a lossof- function mutant of OsVPS9A, which encodes a GEF of OsRAB5A, accumulated uncleaved proglutelins. Proglutelins were mis-targeted to the paramural bodies and to the apoplast along the cell wall in the form of DVs, which led to a concomitant reduction in PBII size. Previously reported gpa1, mutated in OsRab5a, has a similar phenotype, while gpa1gpa2 double mutant exacerbated the conditions. In addition, OsVPS9A interacted with OsRAB5A in vitro and in vivo. We concluded that OsVPS9A and OsRAB5A may work together and play a regulatory role in DV-mediated post-Golgi proglutelin trafficking to PBII (PSV). The evidence that DVs might fuse directly to PBII (PSV) to deliver cargos is also presented.© The Author 2013.

84895069299	Gene SGL, encoding a kinesin-like protein with transactivation activity, is involved in grain length and plant height in rice	Key message: A kinesin-like protein regulates grain length and plant height by affecting expression levels of genes involved in GA synthesis and response in rice Grain shape, a complex agronomic trait, plays an important role in determining yield and quality in rice. In the present study, a mutant named short grain length (sgl) was identified among explants of tissue cultured japonica variety Kita-ake. It exhibited reduced plant height (about 72 % of WT) and short grain length (about 80 % of WT). The reduced length was due to decreased cell elongation. The Short Grain Length (SGL) gene was isolated via map-based cloning and identified to encode a kinesin-like protein. SGL was expressed in the whole plant, especially in the stem and panicles. SGL was shown to have transcriptional activity. In onion epidermal cells, SGL protein was found mainly in the nucleus. Real-time PCR analyses showed that expression levels of genes involved in gibberellin metabolic pathways were affected in the sgl mutant. These data suggested that SGL protein may be involved in regulating GA synthesis and response genes, that in turn, regulates grain length and plant height. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84896390052	Fine mapping of brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) resistance gene Bph28(t) in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens Stål) is one of the most destructive insect pests of rice (Oryza sativa L.) throughout the Asian rice-growing countries. DV85 is a BPH-resistant indica variety. A single dominance gene conferring resistance in DV85 was previously mapped on the long arm of chromosome 11. The objectives of this study were to investigate feeding behaviors of BPH on DV85 plants and fine-map the BPH resistance gene, here designated Bph28(t). A seedling bulk test was conducted to identify resistant plant reactionsvg to BPH feeding. The results showed that the resistance of DV85 functions by means of tolerance during BPH attack, rather than non-preference and antibiosis. For fine mapping, two F2 populations were developed by crossing DV85 with the susceptible japonica variety Kinmaze and indica 9311. A high-resolution genetic map harboring Bph28(t) was constructed and Bph28(t) was finally physically defined to an interval of 64.8 kb between markers Indel55 and Indel66. The fine-mapped Bph28(t) gene will facilitate marker-assisted gene pyramiding for BPH resistance. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84895918412	FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm	Starch is the most widespread form of energy storage in the plant kingdom. Although many enzymes and related factors have been identified for starch biosynthesis, unknown players remain to be identified, given that it is a complicated and sophisticated process. The endosperm of rice (Oryza sativa) has been used for the study of starch synthesis. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 (FLO6) gene in rice. In the flo6 mutant, the starch content is decreased and the normal physicochemical features of starch are changed. Significantly, flo6 mutant endosperm cells show obvious defects in compound granule formation. Map-based cloning showed that FLO6 encodes a protein of unknown function. It harbors an N-terminal transit peptide that ensures its correct localization and functions in the plastid, and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module 48 (CBM48) domain that binds to starch. Furthermore, FLO6 can interact with isoamylase1 (ISA1) both in vitro and in vivo, whereas ISA1 does not bind to starch directly. We thus propose that FLO6 may act as a starch-binding protein involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation through a direct interaction with ISA1 in developing rice seeds. Our data provide a novel insight into the role of proteins with the CBM48 domain in plant species. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

84896868823	GLUTELIN PRECURSOR ACCUMULATION3 encodes a regulator of post-golgi vesicular traffic essential for vacuolar protein sorting in rice endosperm	In seed plants, a major pathway for sorting of storage proteins to the protein storage vacuole (PSV) depends on the Golgi-derived dense vesicles (DVs). However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the directional trafficking of DVs to PSVs remain largely elusive. Here, we report the functional characterization of the rice (Oryza sativa) glutelin precursor accumulation3 (gpa3) mutant, which exhibits a floury endosperm phenotype and accumulates excess proglutelins in dry seeds. Cytological and immunocytochemistry studies revealed that in the gpa3 mutant, numerous proglutelin-containing DVs are misrouted to the plasma membrane and, via membrane fusion, release their contents into the apoplast to form a new structure named the paramural body. Positional cloning of GPA3 revealed that it encodes a plant-specific kelch-repeat protein that is localized to the trans-Golgi networks, DVs, and PSVs in the developing endosperm. In vitro and in vivo experiments verified that GPA3 directly interacts with the rice Rab5a-guanine exchange factor VPS9a and forms a regulatory complex with Rab5a via VPS9a. Furthermore, our genetic data support the notion that GPA3 acts synergistically with Rab5a and VPS9a to regulate DV-mediated post-Golgi traffic in rice. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating the plant-specific PSV pathway and expand our knowledge of vesicular trafficking in eukaryotes. © 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

84900441395	Crystal structures and kinetic properties of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase i from Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus	Huanglongbing (HLB) is a destructive citrus disease. The leading cause of HLB is Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. Fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for bacterial viability and has been validated as a target for the discovery of novel antibacterial agents. Enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (also called ENR or FabI and a product of the fabI gene) is an enzyme required in a critical step of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and has attracted attention as a target of novel antimicrobial agents. We determined the crystal structures of FabI from Ca. L. asiaticus in its apoform as well as in complex with b-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) at 1.7 and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively, to facilitate the design and screening of small molecule inhibitors of FabI. The monomeric ClFabI is highly similar to other known FabI structures as expected; however, unlike the typical tetramer, ClFabI exists as a hexamer in crystal, whereas as dimer in solution, on the other hand, the substrate binding loop which always disordered in apoform FabI structures is ordered in apo-ClFabI. Interestingly, the structure of ClFabI undergoes remarkable conformational change in the substrate-binding loop in the presence of NAD. We conclude that the signature sequence motif of FabI can be considered as Gly-(Xaa)

84899623786	Rice LTG1 is involved in adaptive growth and fitness under low ambient temperature	Low temperature (LT) is one of the most prevalent factors limiting the productivity and geographical distribution of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Although significant progress has been made in elucidating the effect of LT on seed germination and reproductive development in rice, the genetic component affecting vegetative growth under LT remains poorly understood. Here, we report that rice cultivars harboring the dominant LTG1 (Low Temperature Growth 1) allele are more tolerant to LT (15-25°C, a temperature range prevalent in high-altitude, temperate zones and high-latitude areas), than those with the ltg1 allele. Using a map-based cloning strategy, we show that LTG1 encodes a casein kinase I. A functional nucleotide polymorphism was identified in the coding region of LTG1, causing a single amino acid substitution (I357K) that is associated with the growth rate, heading date and yield of rice plants grown at LT. We present evidence that LTG1 affects rice growth at LT via an auxin-dependent process(es). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of this locus suggests that the ltg1 haplotype arose before the domestication of rice in tropical climates. Together, our data demonstrate that LTG1 plays an important role in the adaptive growth and fitness of rice cultivars under conditions of low ambient temperature. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

84901542002	Loss of Function of the Cytochrome P450 Gene CYP78B5 Causes Giant Embryos in Rice	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important food crops in the world. Most kernel oil and micro-nutrients are located in the embryo whereas starch is mainly in the endosperm. Although embryo size is important for rice grain yield and food processing, little is known about the genetic mechanisms controlling embryo size. We characterized a rice giant embryo mutant, giant embryo (ge), which was derived from wild-type Kinmaze by chemical mutagenesis. The large embryo size resulted from larger cell size. The gene controlling the giant embryo trait was cloned by a map-based approach, and shown to encode cytochrome P450 protein CYP78B5, which was previously designated as CYP78A13. Gain-of-function transgenic experiments on OsGE/CYP78B5 in the ge mutant restored the normal seed phenotype. Expression analysis showed that the OsGE/CYP78B5 gene product accumulated mainly in young developing seeds. Subcellular localization indicated that OsGE/CYP78B5 resides in the peroxisomes, and the N-terminal 51 amino acid residues function as a targeting signal. The IAA levels were one-third those of wild type in GE mutants at 6 days after fertilization, yet the embryonic cells were much larger. OsGE/CYP78B5 also regulates expression levels of auxin-responsive and cyclin-related genes. Isolation of GE provides an opportunity to manipulate the nutritive composition and distribution of the grain by marker-assisted selection and transgenic approaches. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84902540009	OsLOX2, a rice type I lipoxygenase, confers opposite effects on seed germination and longevity	Rice production and seed storage are confronted with grain deterioration and loss of seed viability. Some members of the lipoxygenase (LOX) family function in degradation of storage lipids during the seed germination, but little is known about their influence on seed longevity during storage. We characterized the role of rice OsLOX2 gene in seed germination and longevity via over-expression and knock-down approaches. Abundant expression of OsLOX2 was detected in panicles, roots, and stems, but not in leaves. Moreover, OsLOX2 was highly induced during germination. OsLOX2 protein, located in the cytoplasm, showed a wide range of temperature adaptation (20-50 °C) and a substrate preference to linoleic acid. Lines over-expressing OsLOX2 showed accelerated seed germination under normal condition and lower seed viability after accelerated aging. RNA interference (RNAi) of OsLOX2 caused delayed germination and enhanced seed longevity. RNAi lines with strongly repressed OsLOX2 activity completely lost the capability of germination after accelerated aging. More lipid hydroperoxide were found in OE15 than the control, but less in RNAi lines than in the WT Nipponbare. Therefore, OsLOX2 acts in opposite directions during seed germination and longevity during storage. Appropriate repression of the OsLOX2 gene may delay the aging process during the storage without compromising germination under normal conditions. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

84901848338	Semidwarf gene sdk has pleiotropic effects on rice (Oryza sativa L.) plant architecture	Ideal plant architecture has become a significant objective in high-yield rice breeding. In this study, a new semidwarf gene in sdk, a spontaneous dwarf mutant of 'Kasalath', was characterized and genetically mapped. The mutant has smaller panicles and seeds, reduced awns, and is 6-8 days earlier in heading than 'Kasalath'. There was no significant difference in number (No.) of seeds and fertile seeds per panicle. Genetic analysis indicated that the dwarf character of sdk is controlled by a recessive gene, semidwarf k (sdk). From a segregating population of about 65 000 individuals, 4987 sdk-type individuals were sampled. Gene sdk was located in a genomic region of 2622 kb flanked by markers R-12 and R-43 in the centromeric region of chromosome 2.

84904369618	Arabidopsis plastidial folylpolyglutamate synthetase is required for seed reserve accumulation and seedling establishment in darkness	Interactions among metabolic pathways are important in plant biology. At present, not much is known about how folate metabolism affects other metabolic pathways in plants. Here we report a T-DNA insertion mutant (atdfb-3) of the plastidial folylpolyglutamate synthetase gene (AtDFB ) was defective in seed reserves and skotomorphogenesis. Lower carbon (C) and higher nitrogen (N) content in the mutant seeds than that of the wild type were indicative of an altered C and N partitioning capacity. Higher levels of organic acids and sugars were detected in the mutant seeds compared with the wild type. Further analysis revealed that atdfb-3 seeds contained less total amino acids and individual Asn and Glu as well as NO

84906006758	EF8 is involved in photoperiodic flowering pathway and chlorophyll biogenesis in rice	Key message ADTH8/Ghd8allele suppresses flowering by altering the expression patterns of the 'florigen' genes, but also negatively regulates chlorophyll biogenesis. Flowering time is a critical agronomic trait determining the growing season, regional adaptation and yield potential in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We characterized a mutant named early flowering 8 (ef8) selected from an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-treated population of indica cultivar 93-11. It showed earlier flowering, less grains per main panicle and slightly darker green leaves than the wild-type 93-11 under natural long-day conditions, but was not significantly different from 93-11 under natural short-day conditions. We isolated the Early Flowering 8 (EF8) gene by map-based cloning. EF8 encodes a putative HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor, which is localized to the nucleus. EF8 was expressed in various tissues, especially in leaves, with a rhythmic expression pattern. Our data showed that EF8 delayed flowering time under long-day conditions by altering the rhythmic expression patterns of 'florigen' genes Hd3a and RFT1. We also found that EF8 negatively regulates the expression of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes to reduce the chlorophyll content. Our data indicate that EF8 plays an important role in rice photoperiodic flowering pathway as well as yield potential and chlorophyll biogenesis and will be an important target for rice breeding programs. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84906223542	A novel chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in splicing affects chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice	Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins comprise a large family in higher plants and modulate organellar gene expression by participating in various aspects of organellar RNA metabolism. In rice, the family contains 477 members, and the majority of their functions remain unclear. In this study, we isolated and characterized a rice mutant, white stripe leaf (wsl), which displays chlorotic striations early in development. Map-based cloning revealed that WSL encodes a newly identified rice PPR protein which targets the chloroplasts. In wsl mutants, PEP-dependent plastid gene expression was significantly down-regulated, and plastid rRNAs and translation products accumulate to very low levels. Consistently with the observations, wsl shows a strong defect in the splicing of chloroplast transcript rpl2, resulting in aberrant transcript accumulation and its product reduction in the mutant. The wsl shows enhanced sensitivity to ABA, salinity, and sugar, and it accumulates more H

84911873194	Days to heading 7, a major quantitative locus determining photoperiod sensitivity and regional adaptation in rice	Success of modern agriculture relies heavily on breeding of crops with maximal regional adaptability and yield potentials. A major limiting factor for crop cultivation is their flowering time, which is strongly regulated by day length (photoperiod) and temperature. Here we report identification and characterization of Days to heading 7(DTH7), a major genetic locus underlying photoperiod sensitivity and grain yield in rice. Map-based cloning reveals that DTH7 encodes a pseudo-response regulator protein and its expression is regulated by photoperiod. We show that in long days DTH7 acts downstream of the photoreceptor phytochrome B to repress the expression of Ehd1, an up-regulator of the "florigen" genes (Hd3a and RFT1), leading to delayed flowering. Further, we find that haplotype combinations of DTH7 with Grain number, plant height, and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and DTH8 correlate well with the heading date and grain yield of rice under different photoperiod conditions. Our data provide not only a macroscopic viewof the genetic control of photoperiod sensitivity in rice but also a foundation for breeding of rice cultivars better adapted to the target environments using rational design.

12344338363	Analysis of heading time genotype for a rice photoperiod and thermo - sensitive male sterile line PeiAi64S	PeiAi64S, a photoperiod and thermo - sensitive genic male sterile, has been wildly applied to hybrid rice seed production in China, but its photoperiod-sensitivity gene for heading date in this sterile line was still unknown. This definitely limited the further use of this sterile line in breeding practice and re-production of hybrid seeds. To solve this problem, using heading time nearly isogenic lines EG0 - EG7, ER - LR, T65 - T65m and six heading date QTL-isogenic lines, NIL (Hd1) - NIL (Hd6) with the genes of Nipponbare but Hd1 - Hd6 genes from Kasalath respectively, we performed a genetic analysis of PeiAi64S with special reference to photoperiodsensitivity loci, in natural long days at Nanjing(32° N) where the average day-length is about 14 h and in natural short days at Linshui county, Hainan province(18° 29′N), where the average day-length is about 11.6 h during the course of rice growing respectively.
