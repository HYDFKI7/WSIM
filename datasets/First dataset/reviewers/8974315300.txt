16244380830	Unified SPM-ICA for fMRI analysis	A widely used tool for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis, statistical parametric mapping (SPM), is based on the general linear model (GLM). SPM therefore requires a priori knowledge or specific assumptions about the time courses contributing to signal changes. In contradistinction, independent component analysis (ICA) is a data-driven method based on the assumption that the causes of responses are statistically independent. Here we describe a unified method, which combines ICA, temporal ICA (tICA), and SPM for analyzing fMRI data. tICA was applied to fMRI datasets to disclose independent components, whose number was determined by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The resulting components were used to construct the design matrix of a GLM. Parameters were estimated and regionally-specific statistical inferences were made about activations in the usual way. The sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicated that the unified SPM-ICA method had a better performance. Moreover, SPM-ICA was applied to fMRI datasets from twelve normal subjects performing left and right hand movements. The areas identified corresponded to motor (premotor, sensorimotor areas and SMA) areas and were consistently task related. Part of the frontal lobe, parietal cortex, and cingulate gyrus also showed transiently task-related responses. The unified method requires less supervision than the conventional SPM and enables classical inference about the expression of independent components. Our results also suggest that the method has a higher sensitivity than SPM analyses. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

26844477178	Self-organized Locally Linear Embedding for nonlinear dimensionality reduction	Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) is an efficient nonlinear algorithm for mapping high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional observed space. However, the algorithm is sensitive to several parameters that should be set artificially, and the resulting maps may be invalid in case of noises. In this paper, the original LLE algorithm is improved by introducing the self-organizing features of a novel SOM model we proposed recently called DGSOM to overcome these shortages. In the improved algorithm, nearest neighbors are selected automatically according to the topology connections derived from DGSOM. The proposed algorithm can also estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold and eliminate noises simultaneously. All these advantages are illustrated with abundant experiments and simulations. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

The new DGSOM model can compartmentalize input space rationally and efficiently, and generated topological connections among neurons can reflect the dimensionality and structure of input signals.

26844555806	A novel LDA approach for high-dimensional data	Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is one of the most popular linear projection techniques for feature extraction. The major drawback of this method is that it may encounter the small sample size problem in practice. In this paper, we present a novel LDA approach for high-dimensional data. Instead of direct dimension reduction using PCA as the first step, the high-dimensional data are mapped into a relatively lower dimensional similarity space, and then the LDA technique is applied. The preliminary experimental results on the ORL face database verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

33646687498	Spatial and temporal analysis for optical imaging data using CWT and tICA	In this paper a novel temporal-spatial analysis procedure for optical imaging (OI) data of single trail is proposed which exploits the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to detect the activated voxels of cortex and exploits temporal independent component analysis (tICA) to extract the underlying independent sources whose number is determined by Bayesian information criterion. The neural response signals and the V-signals are picked out by investigating the temporal architecture of the independent sources given by tICA. Simulated data is generated to test the validity of the procedure and then the procedure was applied to two sets of OI data of single trail collected from the rats' HP area. The neural response signals together with the pulse-induced and the 0.1 Hz fluctuation signals are extracted from data successfully. The procedure we proposed is a valuable technique for researchers to investigate the temporal and spatial architectures of cortical functional mapping. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

We compare the GIF and RGIF algorithms using the simulated and experimental datum, the results show that the RGIF algorithm can relieve the computational burden substantially with at almost the same computing precision as that with GIF algorithm.

33746334453	A novel method for spatio-temporal pattern analysis of brain fMRI data	A novel data processing procedure for fMRI was suggested in this paper, by which spatial and temporal characteristics of stimuli-induced signal dynamic responses can be investigated simultaneously. First the multitaper spectral estimation was utilized to estimate the spectrum of each voxel; the significance of the line frequency components at the interested frequency was tested to detect the task-related cortex areas; the temporal independent component analysis (tICA) was then applied to the activated voxels to obtain stimuli-induced signal dynamic responses. The advantages of this procedure are: few assumptions are needed for the cerebral hemodynamics and spatial distribution of task-related areas, problems which often appear in tICA analysis of fMRI data, such as the lack of stability, reliability and robustness, are overcome by the suggested method.

Here, we found that intratask evoked asymmetry responses in the motor cortex and cerebellum, and interestingly in the Extra-Nuclear and insula. Intertask comparisons between left and right hand-activated images and between the asymmetries of intratasks of left and right hand, however, revealed distinct lateralization responses in the temporal cortex, extranuclear, parahippocampal gyrus, cingulate gyrus and prominently in basal ganglia. These results suggest that multiple aspects of functional asymmetries in motor organization are reflected in specific brain regions. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

With the development of modern signal processing and statistics techniques, we have the ability to explore more information from EEG, much beyond classic trial-averaging approach. This paper discusses some characteristic methods for feature extraction and pattern classification on EEG data theoretically, and a combined spatial-temporal-frequency analysis strategy is proposed. After comparison of the linear function and support vector machine, reinforcement training is introduced to optimize a pre-designed linear classifier while at the same time restrain over-fitting of the classifier.

33847161201	ReART: A novel adaptive resonance theory for pattern learning and recognition based on NO retrograde	A novel adaptive resonance theory (ART) based on Nitric Oxide (NO) retrograde mechanism, named retrograde ART (ReART), is presented in this paper. Within the theoretical framework of the searching process in ART 3, we analyze the transmitter release among chemical synapses, and propose a novel search hypothesis which incorporates angle and amplitude information to decide whether an external input matches the long-term memory (LTM) weights of an active node or not. By introducing NO retrograde mechanism, the dynamic search and mismatch-reset cycle of ART 3 is improved. To avoid the potential phenomenon of pattern excursion in the node growing process, the forgetting mechanism is constructed. By incorporating the matched nodes and abandoning the erroneous nodes, the novel algorithm optimizes the node growing mechanism. The following simulations indicate that the proposed model has perfect classification, faster convergence and excellent disturbance rejection capability. © 2005 IEEE.

34548758085	Retrograde adaptive resonance theory based on the role of nitric oxide in long-term potentiation	Adaptive resonance theory (ART) demonstrates how the brain learns to recognize and categorize vast amounts of information by using top-down expectations and attentional focusing. ART 3, one member of the ART family, embeds the computational properties of the chemical synapse in its search process, but it converges slowly and is lack of stability when being applied in pattern recognition and analysis. To overcome these problems, Nitric Oxide (NO), which serves as a newly discovered retrograde messenger in Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), is introduced in retrograde adaptive resonance theory (ReART) model presented in this paper. In the presented model a novel search hypothesis is proposed to incorporate angle and amplitude information of an external input vector to decide whether the input matches the long-term memory (LTM) weights of an active node or not, and the embedded NO retrograde mechanism makes the search procedure a closed loop, which improves the stability and convergence speed of the transmitter releasing mechanism in a synapse. To make the model more adaptive and practical, a forgetting mechanism is built to improve the weights updating process. Experimental results indicate that the proposed ReART model achieves low error rate, fast convergence and self-organizing weights regulation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

34548774716	Manifold learning using growing locally linear embedding	Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) is an effective nonlinear dimensionality reduction method for exploring the intrinsic characteristics of high dimensional data. This paper mainly proposes a hierarchical framework manifold learning method, based on LLE and Growing Neural Gas (GNG), named Growing Locally Linear Embedding (GLLE). First, we address the major limitations of the original LLE: intrinsic dimensionality estimation, neighborhood number selection and computational complexity. Then by embedding the topology learning mechanism in GNG, the proposed GLLE algorithm is able to preserve the global topological structures and hold the geometric characteristics of the input patterns, which make the projections more stable and robust. Theoretical analysis and experimental simulations show that GLLE with global topology preservation tackles the three limitations, gives faster learning procedure and lower reconstruction error, and stimulates the wide applications of manifold learning. © 2007 IEEE.

The experiments are in block design paradigm and the scans in task blocks are investigated in a sequential manner. Spatial evolvement of the activated regions along with the time-course are demonstrated. The time series of each region is predicated as the convolution of the stimuli with the hemodynamic response function (HRF) formulated as the sum of two gamma functions. The predicted time series is fitted to the actual one by using a nonlinear least-squares procedure to estimate the HRF parameters.

36448987535	Globally consistent reconstruction of ripped-up documents	One of the most crucial steps for automatically reconstructing ripped-up documents is to find a globally consistent solution from the ambiguous candidate matches. However, little work has been done so far to solve this problem in a general computational framework without using application-specific features. In this paper, we propose a global approach for reconstructing ripped-up documents by first finding candidate matches from document fragments using curve matching and then disambiguating these candidates through a relaxation process to reconstruct the original document. The candidate disambiguation problem is formulated in a relaxation scheme, in which the definition of compatibility between neighboring matches is proposed and global consistency is defined as the global criterion. Initially, global match confidences are assigned to each of the candidate matches. After that, the overall local relationships among neighboring matches are evaluated by computing their global consistency. Then these confidences are iteratively updated using the gradient projection method to maximize the criterion. This leads to a globally consistent solution and thus provides a sound document reconstruction. The overall performance of our approach in several practical experiments is illustrated. The results indicate that the reconstruction of ripped-up documents up to fifty pieces is possibly accomplished automatically. © 2008 IEEE.

36348997473	Structured noise analysis for functional magnetic resonance image	A nonparametric fMRI data noise analysis procedure is proposed in the paper. The fMRI noise is classified into structured and unstructured noise by their temporal characteristics, and their impacts to efficiency of statistical tests are discussed separately. The canonical correlation analysis technique is exploited to extract the underlying structured signals from which the neural response signals are picked up by surrogate test based on reduced autoregression model. The temporal autocorrelation of unstructured noise is eliminated by the randomization method without changing the spectral power. The spectral power of noise in low frequency range descends and the 'white noise' assumption applies better after the application of the procedure. Two kinds of simulation data sets are generated and to which the F-test based on multitaper spectral analysis is applied to test the validity of the technique. Twenty sets of fMRI data are then processed and some task-related areas go undetected in original data are gotten.

This filter applies different competition strategy to monocular cells and binocular cells when cells are cooperating and competing, and then rearranges the activity of the cells to reflect monocular cues and binocular cues. The results show that the approach is feasible to handle monocular cues and it helps us to begin a new method in the field of computer vision.

77954640738	OI and fMRI signal separation using both temporal and spatial autocorrelations	Separating brain imaging signals by maximizing their autocorrelations is an important component of blind source separation (BSS). Canonical correlation analysis (CCA), one of leading BSS techniques, has been widely used for analyzing optical imaging (OI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. However, because of the need to reduce dimensionality and ignore spatial autocorrelation, CCA is problematic for separating temporal signal sources. To solve the problems of CCA, straightforward image projection (SIP) has been incorporated into temporal BSS. This novel method, termed low-dimensional canonical correlation analysis (LD-CCA), relies on the spatial and temporal autocorrelations of all genuine signals of interest. Incorporating both spatial and temporal information, here we introduce a generalized timecourse technique in which data are artificially reorganized prior to separation. The quantity of spatial plus temporal autocorrelations can then be defined. By maximizing temporal and spatial autocorrelations in combination, LD-CCA is able to obtain expected real signal sources. Generalized timecourses are low-dimensional, eliminating the need for dimension reduction. This removes the risk of discarding useful information. The new method is compared with temporal CCA and temporal independent component analysis (tICA). Comparison of simulated data showed that LD-CCA was more effective for recovering signal sources. Comparisons using real intrinsic OI and fMRI data also supported the validity of LD-CCA. © 2010 IEEE.

79952308299	Processing real-world imagery with FACADE-based approaches	This paper considers the processing of real-world imagery in the so-called Form-And-Color-And-DEpth (FACADE) framework, which features some superior mechanisms of the human vision system (HVS). FACADE framework was originally proposed by Grossberg et al. as an integrative model of the HVS to illustrate the possible procedures for visual perception of shape (the boundary contour), surface (luminance and color), and binocular depth. As a simplified, reasonable and mathematically full-fledged approach to the HVS, we saw FACADE as a promising infrastructure through which to construct a powerful image processing engine. However, in our attempts to use the approach in its original modality, to deal with real-world imagery, we found it to be inefficient and non-robust. After re-introducing the model hierarchy and illustrating the involved cell dynamics of the FACADE framework, this paper reveals the crucial issues that lead to the deficiency and accordingly present our substitutive solutions by incorporating the mechanisms of anisotropic spatial- and diffusive orientational-competition to make the HVS-featured model efficient and robust. A computer system based on the improved FACADE engine has been implemented and tested not only with illustrative images to highlight the model characteristics, but also with some real-world imagery in both monocular and binocular situations, thereby demonstrating the ability of the FACADE-based image processing approach featuring the HVS. © 2011 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The number of items of a P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) should be adjustable in accordance with the requirements of the specific tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel task-oriented optimal approach aimed at increasing the performance of general P300 BCIs with different numbers of items. Approach. First, we proposed a stimulus presentation with variable dimensions (VD) paradigm as a generalization of the conventional single-character (SC) and row-column (RC) stimulus paradigms. Furthermore, an embedding design approach was employed for any given number of items. Finally, based on the score-P model of each subject, the VD flash pattern was selected by a linear interpolation approach for a certain task. Main results. The results indicate that the optimal BCI design consistently outperforms the conventional approaches, i.e., the SC and RC paradigms. Specifically, there is significant improvement in the practical information transfer rate for a large number of items. Significance. The results suggest that the proposed optimal approach would provide useful guidance in the practical design of general P300-based BCIs.

45449119083	Noisy manifold learning using neighborhood smoothing embedding	Manifold learning is an important dimensionality reduction tool that discovers the structure of high dimensional data and provides understanding of multidimensional patterns in data mining, pattern recognition, and machine learning. Several manifold learning algorithms are applied to extract the intrinsic features of different prototypes in high dimensional space by preserving the local geometric characteristics. However, due to the locality geometry preservation, these manifold learning methods, including locally linear embedding (LLE), are sensitive to noise. To solve the noisy manifold learning problem, this paper proposes a Neighbor Smoothing Embedding (NSE) for noisy points sampled from a nonlinear manifold. Based on LLE and local linear surface estimator, the NSE smoothes the neighbors of each manifold data and then computes the reconstruction matrix of the projections on the principal surface. Experiments on synthetic data as well as real world patterns demonstrate that the suggested algorithm can efficiently maintain an accurate low-dimensional representation of the noisy manifold data with less distortion, and give higher average classification rates compared to others. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

53849106823	Functional asymmetry in the cerebellum: A brief review	Recent discoveries on the way in which the cerebellum carries out higher non-motor functions, have stimulated a proliferation of researches into functional integration and neural mechanisms in the cerebellum. Cerebellar functional asymmetry is a special characteristic of cerebellar functional organization and the cerebro-cerebellar circuitry that underlies task performance. Multi-level neuroimaging studies demonstrate that cerebellar functional asymmetry has a rather complex pattern, and may be correlated with practice or certain disorders. In this review, we summarize some new and important advances in the understanding of functional laterality of the cerebellum in primary motor and higher cognitive functions, and highlight the differences in the patterns of cerebellar functional asymmetry in the various functional domains. We propose that cerebellar functional asymmetry may be associated with the pattern of connectivity between a large number of widely distributed brain areas and between special cerebellar functional regions. It is suggested that cerebro-cerebellar circuits in particular play an important role in cerebellar functional asymmetry. Finally, we propose that multi-scale connectivity analyses and careful studies of high-level cerebellar functional asymmetry would make an important contribution to the understanding of the human cerebellum and cerebral neural networks. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

In order to resolve this problem, we first study the distribution of the 0.1 Hz low frequency vibration in the brain, then according to the vibration characteristic, present a new low frequency vibration difference image (LFVDI) method. The LFVDI method gets the differential maps with the help of the low frequency vibration characteristic, so it can remove the vascular artifact sharply, Compared to the DI method, the LFVDI method increases the detection performance and robustness greatly. Further, in our study, we find though in the high SNR, the DI and LFVDI methods can not detect the activity maps accurately because of the impact of phase of 0.1 Hz low frequency vibration and the incorrect parameters set. So in this circumstance, we design a select strategy for the pix time series, and using this select strategy, the nonparametric temporal decorrelation source separation (TDSEP) algorithm is introduced into the optical imaging of functional brain successfully, the simulation results show that the detection performance can be improved greatly.

To discriminate nonorthogonal quantum states in some optimal way, a priori knowledge of the discriminated states has to be relied upon. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate some impact of a priori classical knowledge of two quantum states on the optimal unambiguous discrimination. It is exemplified that a priori classical knowledge of the discriminated states, incomplete or complete, can be utilized to improve the optimal success probabilities, whereas the lack of a prior classical knowledge can not be compensated even by more resources. © Rinton Press.

In our method, block-designed task paradigm was employed. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) technique was used to extract the underlying structured sources voxel by voxel. The response signals were detected among structured sources by surrogate test based on the reduced autoregression model (ST-RARM) technique. The power of structured noise was eliminated from original time series and then the data were reconstructed. Monte-Carlo simulation was applied to demonstrate the validity of our method. The results showed that our method was more efficient in activated voxel detection compared to the generally used methods PCA, DCT. Further, by using our method the phase knowledge of response signals was well preserved in the reconstructed data and hence a more accurate estimate was obtained. The final activity mapping was generated by utilizing the knowledge of both response amplitude and phase. The vein artifacts were efficiently reduced. Six sets of true OI data collected from the hind-paw (HP) area of rat's cortex were processed and improved activity mappings were obtained. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

70449338006	From laplacian eigenmaps to kernel locality preserving projections: Equivalence or improvement?	Kernel Locality Preserving Projections (KLPP) and Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) are often taken as two different kinds of approaches in the application of nonlinear dimensionality reduction, but they are more closely related actually than expected. In this paper, KLPP is proved theoretically to solve exactly the same constrained minimization problem as LE. However, the application of KLPP is sensitive to the selections of kernel type and parameters, whereas LE is more efficient and straightforward. Unfolding results on different datasets of the two approaches are presented, together with the comparison of the computation time between KLPP and LE. In our experiments, the actual running time of LE is shorter than that of KLPP, though the time complexity of the two algorithms is comparable. The conclusion of this paper is a beneficial supplement to the nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods system and can be generalized to other algorithms. © 2009 IEEE.

77950025533	Bilateral functional asymmetry disparity in positive and negative schizophrenia revealed by resting-state fMRI	Brain functional asymmetry abnormalities have previously been reported in schizophrenia. In the present study, we hypothesized that the pattern of functional asymmetry in schizophrenia may differ between patients suffering from positive and negative symptoms. We examined the relationship between altered asymmetry of functional connectivity and symptom type (positive/negative) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We selected the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and hippocampus as regions of interest, and analyzed functional connectivity patterns between these and other brain regions. Furthermore, a voxel-based two-level asymmetry analysis was conducted to investigate differences in the asymmetry of functional connectivity patterns within and between groups. Our results showed that patients exhibiting positive symptoms had significantly increased leftward asymmetry of functional connectivity. The negative symptom group, in contrast, exhibited increased rightward asymmetry of functional connectivity. The strength of the asymmetry in these regions was found to be significantly correlated with symptom ratings obtained using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. These results suggest that predominantly positive and predominantly negative schizophrenia may have different neural underpinnings, and that certain regions in the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as the cingulate gyrus and precuneus, play important roles in mediating the symptoms of this complex disease. Our study also provided further evidence for the hypothesis that schizophrenia is related to abnormalities in functional brain networks. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Corresponding gray matter regions showed reduced functional connectivity with other regions in the brain in patients with early-onset schizophrenia, compared with healthy controls. Our results demonstrated abnormal function-structure relationships in early-onset schizophrenia, and supported the view that white matter lesions might disrupt the neural circuits between frontal regions and other brain regions, and affect the functional connectivity in the frontal cortex.

78649855178	Structured noise analysis in intrinsic optical imaging	In this paper, a novel structured noises-reduction technique for OI data is proposed. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) technique is exploited to separate the underlying independent sources among which the neural response signal is picked out by the correlation analysis. The white noise (WN) criterion is applied to discern the structured components from the unstructured ones. The energy of structured noises is then eliminated from the original data. Monte Carlo simulation is used to test the validity of the procedure. The result shows that after the noise reduction, the true positive rate improves significantly without raising the false positive rate. Five sets of OI data of single trial collected from the HP area of rat's cortex are processed by the procedure and the resulting activation maps present more detailed spatial architecture than those without noise reduction. © 2010 IEEE.

The performance of the classical P300 speller, however, declines noticeably in the gaze fixation condition. The speller paradigm presented in this paper aims to release the gaze dependency at the cost of an extra covert visual search task. Methods: Clusters of characters were presented sequentially in the near-central vision as stimulation. Participants fixed their gaze on the center, searched and recognized the target character with covert shift of attention. Random position (RP) and fixed position (FP) presentation modes designed with different searching set size (6 for RP, and ≤2 for FP) were examined. Results: Online sessions using 10 stimulus sequences achieved character accuracies of 94.4% and 96.3% for RP and FP mode, respectively. For offline overall evaluation, the peak written symbol rate (WSR) of 1.38 symbols/min was obtained, with corresponding accuracies of 87.8% (RP) and 84.1% (FP). The P300 waveform of RP mode has evident longer latency and larger amplitude. Electrooculogram (EOG) analysis indicated that the performance was independent of gaze shift. Conclusions: The proposed speller could be operated effectively and gaze independently by healthy participants. Significance: The proposed gaze independent BCI approach promises reasonable communication capability for the profoundly paralyzed patients with head or ocular motor impairments. © 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

79958740004	Natural scene recognition using weighted histograms of gradient orientation descriptor	The automatic recognition of the contents of a scene is an important issue in the computer vision field. Though considerable progress has been made, the complexity of scenes remains an important challenge to computer vision research. Most of the previous scene recognition models are based on the so-called "bag of visual words" method, which uses some clustering method to quantize the numerous local region descriptors into a codebook. The size of the codebook and the selection of initial clustering center have great influence on the performance. Furthermore, the big size of the codebook has high computational cost and memory consumption. To overcome these drawbacks, we present an unsupervised natural scene recognition approach that is not based on the "bag of visual words" method. This approach works by creating multiple resolution images and partitioning them into sub-regions at different scales. The descriptors of all sub-regions in the same resolution image are directly concatenated for support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. To represent images more effectively, we present a new visual descriptor: weighted histograms of gradient orientation (WHGO). We evaluate our approach on three data sets: the 8 scene categories of Oliva et al., the 13 scene categories of Fei-Fei et al. and the 15 scene categories of Lazebnik et al. Experiments show that the WHGO descriptor outperforms the classical scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptor in natural scene recognition, and our approach achieves good performances with respect to the state of the art methods. © 2011 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79957546917	SMR-speller: A novel brain-computer interface spell paradigm	P300-Speller is a typical Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) application, which aimed to construct a direct communication pathway between human brain and computer. Its performance declines as time goes by. And it can cause uncomfortable visual fatigue which makes it not adequate for longtime use. In this paper, we present a novel mental speller paradigm, Sensorimotor Rhythms Speller (SMR-Speller), in which four Motor Imagery (MI) potentials are translated into four move commands, respectively, to select symbols arranged in two cross-like layers. Symbols are distributed by the letters' use frequencies. The proposed mental speller can provide an enduring communication channel for people who are suffering severe neuromuscular disorders only through decoding their brain oscillations. © 2011 IEEE.

79960967896	Brain functional network for chewing of gum	Recent studies showed that gum-chewing induced significant increases in cerebral blood flow and blood-oxygenation level in the widespread brain regions. However, little is known about the underlying mechanism of chewing-induced regional interconnection and interaction within the brain. In this study, we investigated the human brain functional network during chewing of gum by using functional magnetic resonance imaging and complex network theory. Adjacency matrix of the network was constructed by the active voxels of chewing-related. The global statistical properties of the network revealed the brain functional network for chewing of gum had small-world effect and scale-free property. Computing the degree and betweenness which belong to the centrality indices, we found that the neocortical hubs of the network were distributed in the sense and motor cortex, and the nodes in the thalamus and lentiform nucleus held the largest betweenness. The sense and motor cortices as well as thalamus and lentiform nucleus have the important roles in dispatch and transfer information of network. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

80051984501	Sustained negative BOLD response in human fMRI finger tapping task	In this work, we investigated the sustained negative blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response (sNBR) using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a finger tapping task. We observed that the sNBR for this task was more extensive than has previously been reported. The cortical regions involved in sNBR are divided into the following three groups: frontal, somatosensory and occipital. By investigating the spatial structure, area, amplitude, and dynamics of the sNBR in comparison with those of its positive BOLD response (PBR) counterpart, we made the following observations. First, among the three groups, the somatosensory group contained the greatest number of activated voxels and the fewest deactivated voxels. In addition, the amplitude of the sNBR in this group was the smallest among the three groups. Second, the onset and peak time of the sNBR are both larger than those of the PBR, whereas the falling edge time of the sNBR is less than that of the PBR. Third, the long distance between most sNBR foci and their corresponding PBR foci makes it unlikely that they share the same blood supply artery. Fourth, the couplings between the sNBR and its PBR counterpart are distinct among different regions and thus should be investigated separately. These findings imply that the origin of most sNBR foci in the finger-tapping task is much more likely to be neuronal activity suppression rather than "blood steal.". © 2011 Liu et al.

84860631276	Identifying major depression using whole-brain functional connectivity: A multivariate pattern analysis	Recent resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown significant group differences in several regions and networks between patients with major depressive disorder and healthy controls. The objective of the present study was to investigate the whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity patterns of depressed patients, which can be used to test the feasibility of identifying major depressive individuals from healthy controls. Multivariate pattern analysis was employed to classify 24 depressed patients from 29 demographically matched healthy volunteers. Permutation tests were used to assess classifier performance. The experimental results demonstrate that 94.3 (P<0.0001) of subjects were correctly classified by leave-one-out cross-validation, including 100 identification of all patients. The majority of the most discriminating functional connections were located within or across the default mode network, affective network, visual cortical areas and cerebellum, thereby indicating that the disease-related resting-state network alterations may give rise to a portion of the complex of emotional and cognitive disturbances in major depression. Moreover, the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, which exhibit high discriminative power in classification, may play important roles in the pathophysiology of this disorder. The current study may shed new light on the pathological mechanism of major depression and suggests that whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging may provide potential effective biomarkers for its clinical diagnosis. © 2012 The Author.

84861097368	On the role of a priori knowledge in the optimization of quantum information processing	This paper explores the role of a priori knowledge in the optimization of quantum information processing by investigating optimum unambiguous discrimination problems for both the qubit and qutrit states. In general, a priori knowledge in optimum unambiguous discrimination problems can be classed into two types: a priori knowledge of discriminated states themselves and a priori probabilities of preparing the states. It is clarified that whether a priori probabilities of preparing discriminated states are available or not, what type of discriminators one should design just depends on what kind of the classical knowledge of discriminated states. This is in contrast to the observation that choosing the parameters of discriminators not only relies on the a priori knowledge of discriminated states, but also depends on a priori probabilities of preparing the states. Two types of a priori knowledge can be utilized to improve optimum performance but play the different roles in the optimization from the view point of decision theory. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84865169506	Balancing a simulated inverted pendulum through motor imagery: An EEG-based real-time control paradigm	Most brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are non-time-restraint systems. However, the method used to design a real-time BCI paradigm for controlling unstable devices is still a challenging problem. This paper presents a real-time feedback BCI paradigm for controlling an inverted pendulum on a cart (IPC). In this paradigm, sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) were recorded using 15 active electrodes placed on the surface of the subject's scalp. Subsequently, common spatial pattern (CSP) was used as the basic filter to extract spatial patterns. Finally, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to translate the patterns into control commands that could stabilize the simulated inverted pendulum. Offline trainings were employed to teach the subjects to execute corresponding mental tasks, such as left/right hand motor imagery. Five subjects could successfully balance the online inverted pendulum for more than 35. s. The results demonstrated that BCIs are able to control nonlinear unstable devices. Furthermore, the demonstration and extension of real-time continuous control might be useful for the real-life application and generalization of BCI. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84866009594	Scene classification using a multi-resolution bag-of-features model	This paper presents a simple but effective scene classification approach based on the incorporation of a multi-resolution representation into a bag-of-features model. In the proposed approach, we construct multiple resolution images and extract local features from all the resolution images with dense regions. We then quantize these extracted features into a visual codebook using the k-means clustering method. To incorporate spatial information, two modalities of horizontal and vertical partitions are adopted to partition all resolution images into sub-regions with different scales. Each sub-region is then represented as a histogram of codeword occurrences by mapping the local features to the codebook. The proposed approach is evaluated over five commonly used data sets including indoor scenes, outdoor scenes, and sports events. The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs competitively against previous methods across all data sets. Furthermore, for the 8 scenes, 13 scenes, 67 indoor scenes, and 8 sport events data sets, the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

84875853575	A novel hybrid BCI speller based on the incorporation of SSVEP into the P300 paradigm	Objective. Although extensive studies have shown improvement in spelling accuracy, the conventional P300 speller often exhibits errors, which occur in almost the same row or column relative to the target. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) approach by incorporating the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) into the conventional P300 paradigm. Approach. We designed a periodic stimuli mechanism and superimposed it onto the P300 stimuli to increase the difference between the symbols in the same row or column. Furthermore, we integrated the random flashings and periodic flickers to simultaneously evoke the P300 and SSVEP, respectively. Finally, we developed a hybrid detection mechanism based on the P300 and SSVEP in which the target symbols are detected by the fusion of three-dimensional, time-frequency features. Main results. The results obtained from 12 healthy subjects show that an online classification accuracy of 93.85% and information transfer rate of 56.44 bit/min were achieved using the proposed BCI speller in only a single trial. Specifically, 5 of the 12 subjects exhibited an information transfer rate of 63.56 bit/min with an accuracy of 100%. Significance. The pilot studies suggested that the proposed BCI speller could achieve a better and more stable system performance compared with the conventional P300 speller, and it is promising for achieving quick spelling in stimulus-driven BCI applications. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84879931131	Scene recognition combining structural and textural features	Automatic recognition of the contents of a scene is an important issue in the field of computer vision. Although considerable progress has been made, the complexity of scenes remains an important challenge to computer vision research. Most previous approaches for scene recognition are based on the so-called "bag of visual words" model, which uses clustering methods to quantize numerous local region descriptors into a codebook. The size of the codebook and the selection of initial clustering centers greatly affect the performance. Furthermore, the large size of the codebook leads to high computational costs and large memory consumption. To overcome these weaknesses, we present an unsupervised natural scene recognition approach that is not based on the "bag of visual words" model. This approach constructs multiple images of different resolutions and extracts structural and textural features from these images. The structural features are represented by weighted histograms of the gradient orientation descriptor, which is presented in this paper, and the textural features are represented by filter responses of Gabor filters and a Schmid set. We regard the structural and textural features as two independent feature channels, and combine them to realize automatic categorization of scenes using a support vector machine. We then evaluated our approach using three commonly used datasets with various scene categories. Our experiments demonstrate that the weighted histograms of the gradient orientation descriptor outperform the classical scale invariant feature transform descriptor in natural-scene recognition, and our approach achieves good performance with respect to current state-of-the-art methods. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84884208323	Scene classification using multi-resolution low-level feature combination	Most of the current scene classification approaches are based on either low-level or semantic modeling strategies. However, the both strategies have some inherent weaknesses. The low-level modeling based approaches normally classify images into a small number of scene categories and often exhibit poor performance. And the semantic modeling strategies usually bring high computational cost and memory consumption. In this paper, we present a novel approach which retains the advantages of both the low-level and semantic modeling strategies, while at the same time getting over the weaknesses of these two strategies. To represent scene images more effectively, a new visual descriptor called GBPWHGO is introduced. Experimental results on six commonly used data sets demonstrate that our approach performs competitively against previous methods across all data sets, and the GBPWHGO descriptor outperforms the SIFT, LBP and Gist descriptors in scene classification. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84892876971	A subarea-location joint spelling paradigm for the BCI control	Brain computer interface (BCI) speller is an important issue in BCI research. In this paper, we propose a novel spelling paradigm for enhancing the performance of BCI speller. In our approach, the target character is detected by the combination of the P300 potential and the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP). Specifically, the P300 detection mechanism and the SSVEP detection mechanism are employed as two sub-spellers for identifying the number of the subarea and location of target character, respectively and simultaneously. The experimental results show that the information transfer rate (ITR) of our BCI system was significantly improved compared to the traditional BCI approaches, i.e. P300 speller and SSVEP speller. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

In the MISC protocol, each mental task was divided into several continuous epochs with the same duration. During each epoch, one of the two MI tasks was executed. With this protocol, multiple mental states can be coded by the two MI tasks. Additionally, the difficulty of classifier design was also reduced as only two MI tasks were needed to be classified. Three subjects participated in our experiments, and achieved an average accuracy of 85.7%, with the ITR of 16.5 bits/min. The results confirmed that the MISC protocol can generate more commands in BCI system with the equal number of MI tasks. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84893284743	A speedy hybrid BCI spelling approach combining P300 and SSVEP	This study proposes a novel hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) approach for increasing the spelling speed. In this approach, the P300 and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) detection mechanisms are devised and integrated so that the two brain signals can be used for spelling simultaneously. Specifically, the target item is identified by 2-D coordinates that are realized by the two brain patterns. The subarea/location and row/column speedy spelling paradigms were designed based on this approach. The results obtained for 14 healthy subjects demonstrate that the average online practical information transfer rate, including the time of break between selections and error correcting, achieved using our approach was 53.06 bits/min. The pilot studies suggest that our BCI approach could achieve higher spelling speed compared with the conventional P300 and SSVEP spellers. © 2013 IEEE.

84899002420	Brain-actuated humanoid robot control using one class motor imagery task	Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is a new control interface which can translate brain activities directly to computer commands. This paper presents a brain direct-control system for humanoid robot based on one class motor imagery (MI) BCI paradigm. In the paradigm, a hierarchical human-robot interaction protocol was designed based on special gestures of the robot, which can modulate four robot motion commands by only one class of MI task. With this protocol, more available commands can be exported using a small set of MI tasks. Furthermore, as only one MI task needed to be classified directly from the electroencephalograph (EEG) signals, the difficulty of classifier design was also reduced significantly comparing to the traditional multi-class BCI system. The proposed BCI control system was tested in a robot navigation experiment. The average accuracy of the BCI paradigm was 90.7%, and all the subjects could complete the robot navigation task successfully. The results showed that the present BCI control system is feasible and efficient, which can be applied to practical control applications © 2013 IEEE.

84901014902	Balancing an inverted pendulum with an EEG-based BCI	To research the brain computer interface (BCI) for dynamic objects control, in this study, we constructed a BCI paradigm for balancing a virtual inverted pendulum on a cart (IPC). In the paradigm, subjects balanced the pendulum by imaging left/right movements. Not only was the direction, but also the strength of motor imagery was estimated simultaneously from the EEG signals, to generate suitable control force for IPC. Additionally, to solve the inconsistent problem between offline training and online controlling, a special online training experiment was designed to obtain more robust parameters of BCI. Three graduate subjects participated in this study, and two of them fast grasped the skill of IPC balancing, achieved balancing time of about 20 seconds.

84907264711	Hybrid Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based on the EEG and EOG signals	Recently, the integration of different electrophysiological signals into an electroencephalogram (EEG) has become an effective approach to improve the practicality of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, referred to as hybrid BCIs. In this paper, a hybrid BCI was designed by combining an EEG with electrocardiograph (EOG) signals and tested using a target selection experiment. Gaze direction from the EOG and the event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) induced by motor imagery from the EEG were simultaneously detected as the output of the BCI system. The target selection mechanism was based on the synthesis of the gaze direction and ERD activity. When an ERD activity was detected, the target corresponding to the gaze direction was selected; without ERD activity, no target was selected, even when a subjects gaze was directed at the target. With this mechanism, the operation of the BCI system is more flexible and voluntary. The accuracy and completion time of the target selection tasks during the online testing were 89.3% and 2.4 seconds, respectively. These results show the feasibility and practicality of this hybrid BCI system, which can potentially be used in the rehabilitation of disabled individuals.

The scene captured from robot camera was divided into different target regions and displayed to the human subjects with extra visual stimulus superposed on it to reduce the influence of dynamic background scene and the side-effect of gaze shift. The visually evoked potentials was captured from the subjects' EEG signals to accomplish the directions selection mission and to control the NAO robot's movements towards the target region. All the subjects could complete the mission using our BCI paradigm in the real-world environment. The results showed the feasibility of our BCI paradigm in brain-actuated robot control.
