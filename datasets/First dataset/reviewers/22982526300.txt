15044355637	Control of hybrid machines with 2-DOF for trajectory tracking problems	There are two types of drivers in production machine systems: Constant velocity (CV) motor and servo-motor. If a system contains two drivers or more, among which some are of the CV motor while the other are the servo-motor, the system has the so-called hybrid driver architecture and is called hybrid machine for short. The hybrid system has the advantage of high payload and application flexibility. In this brief, we propose a control algorithm and show that the controlled hybrid machine is stable. A simulation is performed to verify the proposed controller. The CV motor has the velocity fluctuation due to the change of its workload. The common approach to attenuate the velocity fluctuation is via a flywheel which is attached on the shaft of the CV motor. We show that this can further improve the tracking performance of the hybrid system. A five-bar linkage with two degrees of freedom is used for illustration throughout the brief. © 2005 IEEE.

18344388684	Optimal design of novel UWB SSCI synthesis pulse signal	A Spread Spectrum CI (SSCI) synthesized narrow pulse technique is put forward based on UWB CI pulse, a narrow pulse signal synthesized by several coherent careers. The power spectrum density is decreased, the frequency usage efficiency is improved and the multi-access application is allowed. Through CI spectrum spreading of each coherent carrier and synthesizing them together, good results can be obtained. The narrow pulse signal synthesized by several SS subcarriers features good signal waveform and anti-multipath high resolution performance of UWB signal. Meanwhile, it is capable of correlative receiving the SS coherent subcarriers, so that the correlative receiving gain is improved and the intersymbol cross-interference is decreased. This study, the ultra-wide band SSCI signal is design to an optimal signal conforming to FCC and ETSI standards by signal optimizing design method, which can reduce the interference with other wireless systems. The paper gives theoretical analysis, design method and computer simulation results. This design method is significant to improve the performance of UWB communication system.

26944454015	Synchronization timing tracking scheme for single user TH-SS PPM ultra wide band system	To date the propagation delay between the transmitter and the receiver is assumed to be perfectly known at the receiver of ultra wide band (UWB) systems. Actually it is impossible for UWB systems to do this because the synchronization timing error must exist between the receiver and the transmitter. Proposed is a synchronization timing tracking scheme for a single user time hopping-spread spectrum pulse position modulation (TH-SS PPM) UWB system. The system framework is described and how it works in details. Computer simulations present system synchronization timing tracking results at the situations of different initial synchronization timing error, sampling interval and signal-to-noise ratio. Simulation results indicate that the less the sampling interval and the greater the signal to noise ratio, the better the system synchronization result.

33749666838	Gold nanoparticles probe for recognition of specific DNA sequence based on non-cross-link system	Simpler, cheaper method for DNA sequence recognition is of a greater scientific and economic interest. In this paper, we develop a novel colorimetric detection method for recognition of specific DNA. The detection method bases on the strong distance-dependent optical properties of gold nanoparticles (Au-nps) and the DNA sequences' electrostatic interactions with the Au-nps. As a result of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) displaying far higher affinities than double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to negatively charged Au-nps, when the concentration of salt is added, Au-nps in ssDNA keep stable because of the absorption of large amount of ssDNA, the mixture's color is red. But Au-nps in dsDNA aggregate immediately, and the mixture's color turns out to be blue. Therefore, we can judge whether the hybridization occurs by the mixture's color or absorption spectrums. Au-nps aggregation in this detection mode is not induced by hybridization of target DNA which cross-links the nanoparticles but by salt, then the color transition is rapid and clearly visible. This method is simple, cheap, and we can detect about 20pmol specific DNA sequences.

33750425176	Detection of K-ras point mutation by unmodified gold nanoparticles and allele-specific amplification	A novel method for point mutation detection was developed. This approach combined the optical properties of gold nanoparticles with the specificity of allele-specific amplification (ASA). K-ras oncogene was studied for its possible point mutation at codon 12. In ASA, only the mutant K-ras gene can be amplified using the mutant-specific primers. Thus, the mutant amplification products were made of mostly double-stranded DNA, while the wild-type products were made of mostly unconsumed single-stranded DNA. Unmodified gold nanoparticles were used as reported groups. The amplification products were mixed with the gold colloid, followed by addition of salt solution. Because single- and double-stranded DNA have different electrostatic interactions with gold nanoparticles, only the gold nanoparticles in the wild-type mixtures did not aggregate due to the adsorption of ss-strand DNA. Therefore, the two kinds of genotype mixtures gave different absorption spectra and colors were observed easily by naked eyes. This new method is rapid, simple, low cost, and will offer a broad application for point mutation detection.

34548324136	Clock domain crossing fault model and coverage metric for validation of SoC design	Multiple asynchronous clock domains have been increasingly employed in System-on-Chip (SoC) designs for different I/O interfaces. Functional validation is one of the most expensive tasks in the SoC design process. Simulation on register transfer level (RTL) is still the most widely used method. It is important to quantitatively measure the validation confidence and progress for clock domain crossing (CDC) designs. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for definition of CDC coverage, which can be used in RTL simulation for a multi-clock domain SoC design. First, we develop a CDC fault model to present the actual effect of metastability. Second, we use a temporal data flow graph (TDFG) to propagate the CDC faults to observable variables. Finally, CDC coverage is defined based on the CDC faults and their observability. Our experiments on a commercial IP demonstrate that this method is useful to find CDC errors early in the design cycles. © 2007 EDAA.

34548073789	An analytical method for calculating torsional constants for arbitrary complicated thin-walled cross-sections	In this paper, an analytical method is proposed for calculating torsional constants for complicated thin-walled cross-sections with arbitrary closed or open rib stiffeners. This method uses the free torsional theory and the principle of virtual work to build governing equilibrium equations involving unknown shear flows and twisting rate. After changing the form of the equations and combining these two unknowns into one, torsional function, which is a function of shear flow, shear modulus, and twisting rate, is included in the governing equations as only one of the unknowns. All the torsional functions can be easily obtained from these homogeneous linear equations, and torsional constants can be easily obtained from the torsional functions. The advantage of this method is that we can easily and directly obtain torsional constants from the torsional functions, rather than the more sophisticated shear flow and twisting rate calculations. Finally, a complicated thin-walled cross-section is given as a valid numerical example to verify the analytical method, which is much more accurate and simpler than the traditional finite element method. © 2007 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag.

35148851428	A novel adaptive energy saving mode in IEEE 802.16E system	Minimizing energy consumption is crucial for portable wireless devices because they operate on a limited battery supply. In this paper, an adaptive energy consumption mechanism for the IEEE 802.16e broadband wireless access (BWA) network was proposed. A mobile subscriber station goes to sleep mode after negations with the base station and temporarily wake-up periodically for a short interval to check whether there is downlink traffic to it to decide whether it goes to awake mode or continues to be in the sleep-mode. The sleep interval is increased exponentially if there is no incoming or outgoing packet during that period. Moreover, the initial sleep interval and maximum interval is adaptive according to the traffic condition. We analytically model the sleep-mode scheme and compare the performance of our scheme with that of traditional energy saving mode by simulations. The result shows that our scheme not only reduces the power consumption dramatically, but also decreases the packet response time.

This mutant displayed spontaneous disease-like lesions in the absence of any pathogen, and was found to confer resistance to multiple isolates of rice blast. We employed a map-based cloning strategy to localize the Spl1 gene. A total of ten cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers linked to the Spl1 gene were identified and mapped to an 8.5-cM region on chromosome 12. A high-resolution genetic map was developed using these ten CAPS markers and a segregating population consisting of 3202 individuals. A BAC contig containing four BAC clones was constructed, and Spl1 was localized to a 423-kb region. Seven spl1 mutants were obtained from the IR64 deletion mutant collection, and molecular analysis using these mutants delimited the Spl1 gene to a 70-kb interval, covered by two BAC clones.

50249130681	Detection and avoidance scheme for direct-sequence ultra-wideband system: A step towards cognitive radio	Detection and avoidance (DAA) is a soft-spectrum-based adaptation scheme proposed for multi-band ultra-wideband (MB-UWB) radio as a measure of co-existence between UWB devices and existing radio systems in overlapped bands. However, the principle of DAA in the direct-sequence UWB (DS-UWB) is very different from that in MB-UWB method. In DS-UWB, re-design of transmission pulses is required each time a new set of allowed bandwidths is discovered, as opposed to the turning-off-carrier-tone way in MB-UWB. Therefore the re-design of DS-UWB pulses in a cognitive radio environment must be easily reconfigurable. The problem of synthesising DS-UWB pulses conforming to arbitrary spectrum masks is addressed. In the proposed method, the masks are expanded by orthonormal functions chosen to be Hermite-Gaussian functions (HGFs). As the HGFs are eigenfunctions to the fractional Fourier transform, of which the inverse Fourier transform is a particular case, the set of the HGFs constitutes both a time-domain and a frequency-domain basis, that is, a co-basis, and therefore the transmission pulses can be easily obtained from the expansion of the specified spectrum masks. The co-basis-expansion-based DAA scheme for DS-UWB is evaluated through computer simulations. © 2008 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The complexity of maximum likelihood detection algorithm, such as general Viterbi algorithm for MTCM, is very high. Based on the design characters of MTCM, an applicable decoding algorithm is presented: First, the state sequence of MTCM is determined, and then the symbol sequence between two successive determined states is decoded. With this algorithm, it is not necessary for the decoding output to wait for until the whole symbol sequence is received, that will lead to an acceptable short decoding delay. For MTCM symbol sequences suffering from wireless fading, the decoding performance can approximate that of the maximum likelihood decoding algorithm by changing one parameter. Theoretic analysis and simulation can prove the proposed.

58449101860	An efficient game-based competitive spectrum offering scheme in cognitive radio networks with dynamic topology	In practical cognitive radio networks, the topology is constantly changing since the primary and secondary users join and leave the network at any moment. So it is very important to design a distributed spectrum offering scheme that can coordinate the spectrum offering scheme adapt to dynamic topology with only local information. In this paper, we propose a game-based distributed spectrum offering scheme in cognitive radio network with dynamic topology in which multiple primary users with spectrum opportunity compete with each other to offer spectrum access to the secondary users. We obtain the Nash equilibrium of the game and analyze the impacts of the dynamic topology on the Nash equilibrium. In addition, we present a iterative distributed spectrum offering algorithm for the case when the primary users can not observe the current action and utility adopted by others. We theoretically prove that the algorithm can converge to Nash equilibrium within a few iterative steps. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve better performances. © 2008 IEEE.

The derived optimal weights are determined by individual signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of each cooperative sensing node. However, to obtain the precise realistic measurement of each node's SNR is somehow impractical or even infeasible in implementation. Reference matrices are therefore proposed to adaptively record primary user's history behaviors and scavenge the indispensable individual SNR information hidden behind them for setting the weights.

60649088860	A type of MTCM-OFDM system model and its performance analysis	By applying the technique of multiple trellis coded modulation (MTCM) to an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, the paper proposes a type of MTCM-OFDM system model, and gives the results of analysis and simulation of it. The analysis indicates that the MTCM has its exclusive merit that the information rate and frequency band utilization are not sacrificed after coding and modulating, and an OFDM system in combination with MTCM can enlarge the signal Euclidean composed by k sub carriers signals, so the bit error rate (BER) performance is improved. According to the MTCM design, the output sequences from different state can have much larger Euclidean distance. Based on this fact, the symbols carried by sub carriers can be determined by two steps: first, the state sequence of the trellis diagram can be determined for a larger probability by the maximum likelihood sequence detection method, and then the symbol sequence is determined between the two successive determined states. This algorithm is advanced based on the design character of MTCM, so its decoding delay is lower and the complexity is reduced. The BER performance can approach that of the direct maximum likelihood detection. The theoretic analysis and the Monte-Carlo simulation results can prove the above performance features.

Based on this method, the side-lobe signal of MB-OFDM decreases quickly, and then the frequency notch, overlapping with other radio services, is deep enough. Consequently, interferences from cognitive radio systems is decreased, and the coexistence with other narrow band radio services is realized. In addition, theoretic analysis and simulation results show that the coded-modulation scheme has an additional merit: When SNR arrives at a certain value, compared with traditional modulation, much better Bit Error Rate (BER) performance can be achieved over Rayleigh fading channels.

With the help of multiple secondary users (SU) in the cognitive radio network, various cooperative sensing schemes are investigated to enhance the energy detection performance. However, the impacts of noise power fluctuating effects on the detection performance in multipath fading and user cooperative sensing scenarios are seldom evaluated in relevant literature. In this paper, a modified version of the classic energy detection model is presented, where the noise power uncertainty (U) is introduced into threshold setting. With a reasonable approximate derivation, we provide accurate predictions of SNRwall constraints imposed by U in Rayleigh fading environments. In addition, by employing a simple hard decision fusion rule, the collaborative gain in spectrum sensing performance is also quantified with respect to U.

67649978008	Balanced clustering multi-hop routing algorithm for LEACH protocol in wireless sensor networks	LEACH protocol is one of the most popular cluster-based protocols, which has been widely proposed in wireless sensor network. To maintain balanced energy consumption, LEACH probabilistically rotates the role of cluster head among all the nodes. However, the performance of the LEACH protocol is far from optimal. To reduce the energy consumption and prolong the network lifetime, a balanced clustering multi-hop (BCM) routing algorithm is introduced in this paper. The BCM improves the method of choosing cluster head, makes the node that has the largest residual energy as the cluster head in next round and at the same time takes the communication radius and cluster size into account in cluster setup state. The multi-hop communication among cluster heads and intra-cluster cycle conception are also introduced in BCM, which improve communication mode from single hop to multi-hop between the cluster head and the sink, and keep the cluster structure unchanged in several rounds. Simulation results show that BCM results in more balanced cluster distribution, more efficient energy consumption, and compared with LEACH protocol, this algorithm consumes less power and has longer network lifetime.

PCC-OFDM has the good performance of compressing intercarrier interference (ICI) at the cost of high PAPR. The most PAPR analysis assume the subcarriers to be identically and independently distributed (i.i.d).

Exploiting the particular filter with zero group delay, ultra narrow band (UNB) modulation is intended for acquiring the high frequency efficiency. Unfortunately, this UNB filter is confronted with great challenges from the classical communication theories. The validation on its realization is also difficult. This paper proposes a novel UNB modulation, namely random pulse position keying (RPPK). It is demonstrated from analysis that there is no inessential discrete spectral line in modulated signal's power density spectrum (PDS), and the UNB filter has been successfully avoided. Consequently, RPPK is rather explicit in theory and simple in implementation. As is shown by the simulation, the frequency utilization of RPPK can even reach 100 bits/s/Hz. Its optimum receiving performance is slightly inferior to BPSK, yet is much superior to that of other UNB modulations such as VMSK/2.

The techniques of the quantum router, optical switch and trusted relay are assembled here to divide the seven-user network into a four-node backbone net, a two-user subnet and a single-fiber access link. Secure keys distributed in this network can be utilized to encrypt the instant video, sound, text messages and confidential files transmitting between nodes. The whole implementation including the hierarchical quantum cryptographic communication links and the corresponding application software shows a big step toward the practical user-oriented network with a high security level. © 2010 Optical Society of America.

77955727883	Distributed water-filling algorithm for direct-sequence ultra wideband cognitive radio network with limit on aggregate power emission	Despite their near-noise power emission, ultra wideband (UWB) radios, particularly direct-sequence ultra wideband (DS-UWB), are still possible to cause harmful interference to legacy radio systems. When they participate in a large dense cognitive radio network (CRN) and transmit simultaneously, their joint power emission would be disastrous if without control. We address this problem by imposing a limit on the aggregate power emission of DS-UWB CRN. The limit is negotiable. It takes effect by letting each transmitter adapt to a spectrum void defined as the area below the limit itself and above the interference temperature experienced instantly by the transmitter. We propose a water-filling algorithm that maximises the sum capacity while enabling each transmitter to fit its power spectral density into, and thus to make the most of, the spectrum void. The algorithm is performed locally at the transmitter with low complexity. Numerical analysis based on a realistic office network shows that the algorithm can bring the aggregate power emission even down below the Federal Communications Commission limit for individual UWB device, but still guarantees a given bit-error performance to nearly 40 active users. © 2010 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

0035759452	Synchronization of separation and analysis based on multi-channel mode-filtered light detection with CE	A novel method of synchronization of separation and analysis is described, which use the mode-filtered light detection as an on line detector of capillary electrophoresis, furthermore, corresponding to this method an instrument has been established. Capillary electrophoresis runs in an annular column, which is constructed by a naked optical fiber inserted into a fused silica capillary, instead of a round capillary. Moreover, the annular column isn't only a vessel for electrophoresis but also a sensor to the mode-filtered light. Along the annular column side several detection channels are set up to gather the mode-filtered light and transmit it to CCD, so every channel provides the information of the sample from where it is located. Using the capillary isotachophoresis in this annular column, a sample containing alanine and glycin is separated and analyzed simultaneously by the multi-channel mode-filtered light detection.

12844278100	Performance analysis of a single user TH-SS PPM UWB system with synchronization timing tracking ability	It is usually assumed that the perfect propagation delay has been achieved between the receiver and the transmitter, the receiver and the transmitter synchronize perfectly, actually it is impossible to do this. Because of this, this paper proposes a single user TH-SS PPM UWB system with synchronization timing tracking ability, designs the synchronization timing tracking scheme, derives the receiver demodulator output SNR while the synchronization timing error exists between the transmitter and the receiver. The synchronization timing error has great effects on the system BER performance. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the less the synchronization timing error, the less the system BER.
