Analysis of the system's internal flow quality , indicated that the system's back pressure fulfilled the design requirements, the pre-muffler's internal flow field is smooth, but the main muffler's wall temperature differences are high, and there are large turbulent flow and jet flow in it, therefore the main muffler's wall has a higher risk of hot deformation, the main muffler has a greater potential for regenerative noise and one of its inner bafflers is more likely to be damaged because of shock. For these reasons, the main muffler's structure should be improved. After modified, the main muffler's temperature distribution is more even, turbulence energy grows down, and the baffler opposite the jet flow is thickened. ©2010 IEEE.

Based on oxygen storage and release properties of three-way catalyst and analyzing its working process, a catalytic converter oxygen storage and release model was established on the basis of double linear oxygen sensor signals and a series of indexes, e.g. oxygen storage and release capacity index φ, oxygen storage capacity OSC, oxygen storage and release rate μ etc. were introduced to evaluate catalytic converter performance. Based on the test of transition between "rich and lean" and adopting least square method to identify the model parameters, the performance parameters were estimated by using model simulation, and the catalytic converter aging factor ρ was introduced. Under different aging levels (ρ=1, 0.8, 0.6), the catalyst performance indexes (φ, OSC and μ) decline, effectively reflecting the changes of converter performance, thus these indexes can be used for catalytic converter online estimation.

At the same time an energy consumption test of PHEV in laboratory is also conducted with ECE R101 as reference. Based on the results of laboratory test, both schemes of weighting by average charged range (ECE R101) and utility factor (SAE J2814) are adopted for post-processing and the results of energy consumption are compared with that of fleet's data for exploring a comprehensive evaluation method better reflecting the real-world PHEV energy consumption on road. The results show that both schemes can well predict the energy consumption of PHEV in real operation, but with different weighting factors the results of comprehensive energy consumption all have a some 10 % deviation from real-world data. So for laboratory test to more accurately reflect the real road energy consumption of PHEV, both weighting factors and the conditions of laboratory test should be adjusted.

Applying the simulation of pantograph-catenary interaction based on infinite element method, this paper simulated the dynamic performance of pantograph-catenary system for high-tension overhead contact system at over 350km/h. The research findings showed that wave propagation speed can still serve as a brief computing method for the running speed within the range of 350-400km/h. When the running speed reaches 80% of the wave propagation speed or higher, the current-carrying quality of double-pantograph-catenaries system might not satisfy the standard of EN 50367 all the time. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84897805552	Numerical study on evaporation characteristics of DME/LPG dual fuel droplet	Based on simple-component droplet evaporation model, a conversion model for multi-component droplet evaporation was established and used to simulate subcritical evaporation process of dimethyl ether (DME)/liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) mixture droplet, wet bulb temperature of each component under different ambient temperatures and pressures, and bi-component droplet wet bulb temperature variation with each component mole fraction were obtained. The effects of initial mole fraction and initial temperature of each component in droplet, environment temperature and pressure, and mixing-rules on the multi-component droplet evaporation were examined. The results show that in same environment conditions, the mixture wet bulb temperature increases with DME mole fraction increasing, and for droplet of same initial quality, the larger the DME mole fraction, the longer the evaporation time. For the multi-component droplet with same initial quality and component concentration, the closer to wet bulb temperature the initial temperature is, the shorter the evaporation time; the higher the environment pressure and the wet bulb temperature, the smaller the mixture diffusion coefficient, the heated time proportion during droplet survival period increases obviously and the evaporation time gets longer; when using the No. 2 Mixing Rule the evaporation time becomes longer.

84901663618	Comparison of comprehensive properties of Ni-MH (nickel-metal hydride) and Li-ion (lithium-ion) batteries in terms of energy efficiency	In this work, we successfully proposed a method to compare the comprehensive properties of different battery systems in terms of a parameter, energy efficiency. The quantitative relationship of OCV (open circuit voltage) and SOC (state of charge) for Ni-MH batteries is firstly established to calculate the energy efficiency. Then a comprehensive comparison of the energy efficiency for Ni-MH and Li-ion batteries is systemically analyzed under different operating conditions. The results suggest that the energy efficiency is larger for Li-ion batteries than for Ni-MH batteries under charge and charge-discharge cycles, but lesser under a large current rate discharge. The outcome indicates that Ni-MH batteries are more favorable in the case of large current rates discharge than Li-ion batteries. Under plus current rates, two factors, SOC and current rates are analyzed with respect to energy efficiency. For both the batteries, the energy efficiency is varied slightly with SOC, but declines greatly with increased current rates. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
