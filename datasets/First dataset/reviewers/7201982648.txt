84926656516	PML represses lung cancer metastasis by suppressing the nuclear EGFR-mediated transcriptional activation of MMP2	Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is emerging as an important tumor suppressor. Its expression is lost during the progression of several types of cancer, including lung cancer. The EGF receptor (EGFR), a membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase, transduces intracellular signals responsible for cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. EGFR activity is frequently abnormally upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) and thus is considered to be a driving oncogene for LAC. EGFR translocates into the nucleus and transcriptionally activates genes, such as CCND1, that promote cell growth. Recently, we demonstrated that PML interacted with nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) and suppressed the nEGFR-mediated transcriptional activation of CCND1 in lung cancer cells, thereby restraining cell growth. When we further investigated the interplay between PML and EGFR in lung cancer metastasis, we found that the matrix metalloprotease-2 gene (MMP2) was a novel nEGFR target gene and was repressed by PML. We provide evidence that nEGFR bound to the AT-rich sequence (ATRS) in the MMP2 promoter and enhanced its transcriptional activity. In addition, we demonstrated that PML repressed nEGFR-induced MMP2 transcription and reduced cell invasion. PML was recruited by nEGFR to the MMP2 promoter where it reduced histone acetylation, leading to the transcriptional repression of MMP2. Finally, we demonstrated that PML upregulation by interferon-β (IFNβ) in lung cancer cells decreased MMP2 expression and cell invasion. Together, our results suggested that IFNβ induced PML to inhibit lung cancer metastasis by repressing the nEGFR-mediated transcriptional activation of MMP2.

15444380557	Daxx mediates the small ubiquitin-like modifier-dependent transcriptional repression of Smad4	Daxx has been shown to function as an apoptosis regulator and transcriptional represser via its interaction with various cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. Here, we showed that Daxx interacts with Smad4 and represses its transcriptional activity via the C-terminal domain of Daxx. In vitro and in vivo interaction studies indicated that the binding of Smad4 to Daxx depends on Smad4 sumoylation. Substitution of Smad4 SUMO conjugation residue lysine 159, but not 113, to arginine not only disrupted Smad4-Daxx interaction but also relieved Daxx-elicited repression of Smad4 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed the recruitment of Daxx to an endogenous, Smad4-targeted promoter in a Lys

1842534326	The role of tyrosine kinase Etk/Bmx in EGF-induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells	Etk/Bmx, a member of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases, mediates various signaling pathways and confers several cellular functions. In the present study, we have explored the functional role of Etk in mediating EGF-induced apoptosis, using MDA-MB-468 cell line as a model. We first demonstrated that EGF treatment induces Etk tyrosine phosphorylation in both HeLa and MDA-MB-468 cells. Overexpression of Etk by recombinant adeno-virus in MDA-MB-468 cells potentiates the extent of EGF-induced cell apoptosis. The observed Etk-enhanced MDA-MB-468 cell apoptosis is associated with the Stat1 activation, as demonstrated by electrophoresis mobility shift assays and reporter gene assays. By contrast, a kinase domain deletion mutant EtkΔK, functioning as a dominant-negative mutant, ameliorates EGF-induced Stat1 activation and apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells. To explore whether the activated Etk alone is sufficient for inducing apoptosis, a conditionally activated Etk (ΔEtk-ER), a chimeric fusion protein of PH domain-truncated Etk and ligand-binding domain of estrogen receptor, was introduced into MDA-MB-468 cells. Upon β-estradiol ligand activation, the ΔEtk-ER could stimulate Stat1 activity and confer cell apoptosis independent of EGF treatment. Taken together, our findings indicate that Etk is a downstream signaling molecule of EGF receptor and suggest that Etk activation is essential for transducing the EGF-induced apoptotic signaling.

0030753971	Regulation of the expression of lipogenic enzyme genes by carbohydrate	Diets high in simple carbohydrates and low in fats lead in the mammalian liver to induction of a set of enzymes involved in lipogenesis. This induction occurs, in part, through transcriptional mechanisms that lead to elevated levels of the mRNA for these enzymes. For most of the lipogenic enzymes, an increase in glucose metabolism is required to trigger the transcriptional response. The intracellular mediator of this signaling pathway is unknown, although evidence suggests either glucose-6-phosphate or xylulose-5-phosphate. Studies to map the regulatory sequences of lipogenic enzyme genes involved in the transcriptional response have been performed for the L-type pyruvate kinase, S

2342445865	YY1AP, A Novel Co-activator of YY1	With the aim of identifying potential cellular proteins that mediate the transcriptional regulation of YY1, a HeLa cDNA library was screened using the yeast two-hybrid system. A previously unknown protein interacting with YY1 was identified and named YY1AP. By using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique, the full-length cDNA of YY1AP was cloned and sequenced. The cDNA was 2253 bp in length and encoded an open reading frame of 750 amino acids. The chromosomal gene was made up of 10 exons separated by nine introns and is localized on chromosome 1 (1q21.3). Northern blot analysis revealed that YY1AP is ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues and cancer cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunostaining of cells further indicated that YY1AP co-localizes with YY1 in the nucleus. Furthermore, YY1AP was shown to be capable of enhancing the transcriptional activation of an YY1 responsive promoter. Subsequent analysis by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay showed that YY1AP contained two YY1 binding regions. The transactivation region of YY1AP would seem to be localized within the section of amino acids 260-345. It is proposed that YY1AP is a novel co-activator of YY1.

27144529047	Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr interacts with antiapoptotic mitochondrial protein HAX-1	Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 viral protein R (Vpr) is required for viral pathogenesis and has been implicated in T-cell apoptosis through its activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9 and perturbation of mitochondrial membrane potential. To understand better Vpr-mitochondria interaction, we report here the identification of antiapoptotic mitochondrial protein HAX-1 as a novel Vpr target. We show that Vpr and HAX-1 physically associate with each other. Overexpression of Vpr in cells dislocates HAX-1 from its normal residence in mitochondria and creates mitochondrion instability and cell death. Conversely, overexpression of HAX-1 suppressed the proapoptotic activity of Vpr. Copyright © 2005, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

28044437730	SUMO modification negatively modulates the transcriptional activity of CREB-binding protein via the recruitment of Daxx	Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification is emerging as an important control in transcription regulation. Here, we show that CREB-binding protein (CBP), a versatile transcriptional coactivator for numerous transcription factors in response to diverse signaling events, can be modified by SUMO-1 at lysine residues 999, 1034, and 1057 both in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of the SUMO acceptor lysine residues either individually or in combination enhanced CBP transcriptional activity, and expression of a SUMO protease SENP2 potentiated the transcriptional activity of CBP wild-type but not its sumoylation mutant, indicating that SUMO modification negatively regulates CBP transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated an interaction of SUMO-1-modified CBP with the transcriptional corepressor Daxx and an essential role of Daxx in mediating SUMO-dependent transcriptional regulation of CBP through histone deacetylase 2 recruitment. Together, our findings indicate that SUMO modification and subsequent recruitment of Daxx represent a previously undescribed mechanism in modulating CBP transcriptional potential. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

27844467195	FLI-1 functionally interacts with PIASxα, a member of the PIAS E3 SUMO ligase family	FLI-1 is a transcription factor of the ETS family that is involved in several developmental processes and that becomes oncogenic when overexpressed or mutated. As the functional regulators of FLI-1 are largely unknown, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with FLI-1 and identified the SUMO E3 ligase PIASxα/ARIP3 as a novel in vitro and in vivo binding partner of FLI-1. This interaction involved the ETS domain of FLI-1 and required the integrity of the SAP domain of PIASxα/ARIP3. SUMO-1 and Ubc9, the ubiquitin carrier protein component in the sumoylation pathway, were also identified as interactors of FLI-1. Both PIASxα/ARIP3 and the closely related PIASxβ isoform specifically enhanced sumoylation of FLI-1 at Lys

33749031320	Male germ cell-associated kinase, a male-specific kinase regulated by androgen, is a coactivator of androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells	Androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-induced transcriptional factor, which plays an important role in the normal development of prostate as well as in the progression of prostate cancer. Numerous coactivators, which associate with AR and function to remodel chromatin and recruit RNA polymerase II to enhance the transcriptional potential of AR, have been identified. Among these coactivators, few are protein kinases. In this study, we describe the characterization of a novel protein kinase, male germ cell-associated kinase (MAK), which serves as a coactivator of AR. We present evidence, which indicates that (a) MAK physically associates with AR (MAK and AR are found to be coprecipitated from cell extracts, colocalized in nucleus, and corecruited to prostate-specific antigen promoter in LNCaP as well as in transfected cells); (b) MAK is able to enhance AR transactivation potential in an androgen- and kinase-dependent manner in several prostate cancer cells and synergize with ACTR/steroid receptor coactivator-3 coactivator; (c) small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knocks down MAK expression resulting in the reduction of AR transactivation ability; (d) MAK-shRNA or kinase-dead mutant, when introduced into LNCaP cells, reduces the growth of the cells; and (e) microarray analysis of LNCaP cells carrying kinase-dead MAK mutant showed a significant impediment of AR signaling, indicating that endogenous MAK plays a general role in AR function in prostate cancer cells and likely to be a general coactivator of AR in prostate tissues. The highly restricted expression of this kinase makes it a potentially useful target for intervention of androgen independence. ©2006 American Association for Cancer Research.

33749045454	Human cellular protein VRK2 interacts specifically with Epstein-Barr virus BHRF1, a homologue of Bcl-2, and enhances cell survival	BHRF1, an early gene product of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), is structurally and functionally homologous to BcI-2, a cellular anti-apoptotic protein. BHRF1 has been shown to protect cells from apoptosis induced by numerous external stimuli. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is an epithelial cancer associated closely with EBV infection. Specific proteins that might interact with and modulate the BHRF1 anti-apoptotic activity in normal epithelial cells are of interest. Therefore, a cDNA library derived from normal human foreskin keratinocytes was screened by the yeast two-hybrid system and a cellular gene encoding human vaccinia virus B1R kinase-related kinase 2 (VRK2) was isolated. Interaction between the cellular VRK2 and viral BHRF1 proteins was further demonstrated by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, confocal laser-scanning microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation. Analyses of VRK2-deletion mutants revealed that a 108 aa fragment at the C terminus was important for VRK2 to interact with BHRF1. For BHRF1, aa 1-18 and 89-142 were crucial in interacting with VRK2 and these two regions are counterparts of BcI-2 homology domains 4 and 1. Overexpressed VRK2 alone showed a modest effect in anti-apoptosis and appeared to enhance cell survival in the presence of BHRF1. However, this enhancement was not observed when VRK2 was co-expressed with BcI-2. The results indicate that human VRK2 interacts specifically with EBV BHRF1 and that the interaction is involved in protecting cells from apoptosis. © 2006 SGM.

33750491062	Role of SUMO-Interacting Motif in Daxx SUMO Modification, Subnuclear Localization, and Repression of Sumoylated Transcription Factors	Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification has emerged as an important posttranslational control of protein functions. Daxx, a transcriptional corepressor, was reported to repress the transcriptional potential of several transcription factors and target to PML oncogenic domains (PODs) via SUMO-dependent interactions. The mechanism by which Daxx binds to sumoylated factors mediating transcriptional and subnuclear compartmental regulation remains unclear. Here, we define a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) within Daxx and show it to be crucial for targeting Daxx to PODs and for transrepression of several sumoylated transcription factors, including glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In addition, the capability of Daxx SIM to bind SUMO also controls Daxx sumoylation. We further demonstrate that arsenic trioxide-induced sumoylation of PML correlates with a change of endogenous Daxx partitioning from GR-regulated gene promoter to PODs and a relief of Daxx repression on GR target gene expression. Our results provide mechanistic insights into Daxx in SUMO-dependent transcriptional control and subnuclear compartmentalization. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

34249717337	Heptad repeats regulate protein phosphatase 2A recruitment to I-κB kinase γ/NF-κB essential modulator and are targeted by human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 tax	The switching on-and-off of I-κB kinase (IKK) and NF-κB occurs rapidly after signaling. How activated IKK becomes down-regulated is not well understood. Here we show that following tumor necrosis factor-α stimulation, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) association with IKK is increased. A heptad repeat in IKKγ, helix 2 (HLX2), mediates PP2A recruitment. Two other heptad repeats downstream of HLX2, termed coiled-coil region 2 (CCR2) and leucine zipper (LZ), bind HLX2 and negatively regulate HLX2 interaction with PP2A. HTLV-1 transactivator Tax also binds HLX2, and this interaction is enhanced by CCR2 but reduced by LZ. In the presence of Tax, PP2A-IKKγ binding is greatly strengthened. Interestingly, peptides spanning CCR2 and/or LZ disrupt IKKγ-Tax and IKKγ-PP2A interactions and potently inhibit NF-κB activation by Tax and tumor necrosis factor-α. We propose that when IKK is resting, HLX2, CCR2, and LZ form a helical bundle in which HLX2 is sequestered. The HLX2-CCR2-LZ bundle becomes unfolded by signal-induced modifications of IKKγ or after Tax binding. In this conformation, IKK becomes activated. IKKγ then recruits PP2A via the exposed HLX2 domain for rapid down-regulation of IKK. Tax-PP2A interaction, however, renders PP2A inactive, thus maintaining Tax-PP2A-IKK in an active state. Finally, CCR2 and LZ possibly inhibit IKK activation by stabilizing the HLX2-CCR2-LZ bundle.

37749036302	Daxx mediates SUMO-dependent transcriptional control and subnuclear compartmentalization	SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) modification is emerging as an important post-translational control in transcription. In general, SUMO modification is associated with transcriptional repression. Although many SUMO-modified transcription factors and co-activators have been identified, little is known about the mechanism underlying SUMOylation-elicited transcriptional repression. Here, we summarize that SUMO modification of transcription factors such as androgen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, Smad4 and CBP [CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein)-binding protein] co-activator results in the recruitment of a transcriptional co-repressor Daxx, thereby causing transcriptional repression. Such a SUMO-dependent recruitment of Daxx is mediated by the interaction between the SUMO moiety of SUMOylated factors and Daxx SUMO-interacting motif. Interestingly, the transrepression effect of Daxx on these SUMOylated transcription factors can be relieved by SUMOylated PML (promyelocytic leukaemia) via altering Daxx partition from the targeted gene promoter to PML nuclear bodies. Because Daxx SUMO-interacting motif is a common binding site for SUMOylated factors, a model of competition for Daxx recruitment between SUMOylated PML and SUMOylated transcription factors was proposed. Together, our findings strongly suggest that Daxx functions as a SUMO reader in the SUMO-dependent regulation of transcription and subnuclear compartmentalization. ©The Authors.

0033542079	Functional analysis of human Smad1: Role of the amino-terminal domain	The signals originating from transforming growth factor β/activin/bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are transduced by a set of evolutionarily conserved family of Smad proteins which, upon activation, directly translocate to the nucleus where they may activate transcription. Smad proteins of different species contain conserved amino- (N) and carboxy- (C) terminal domains separated by a proline-rich linker. Human, Drosophila, and Xenopus Smad1 all have been shown to mediate the biological effects of BMP-4 in Xenopus embryos. We have investigated the functional domains of human Smad1 (hSmad1) using the Xenopus embryo system. Dorsal injection of hsmad1 RNA into the 4-cell-stage embryos results in embryonic ventralization. Since the C-terminus of Smads has been shown to mediate the transcriptional activity, whereas this activity is masked by the presence of the N-terminus, we tested the effect of a hSmad1 construct lacking the C-terminal domain [hSmad1(N)] in the Xenopus embryo system. Surprisingly, we found that hSmad1(N) not only synergizes with hSmad1 in embryonic ventralization, but induces ventralization by itself. Ectopic expression of a dominant negative BMP receptor (DN-BR) as well as neural inducers noggin and chordin induce neurogenesis in the animal cap, which is inhibited by co-expression of either hSmad1 or hSmad1(N). Ventral expression of DN-BR induces formation of a second body axis at tailbud stage, which is also prevented by hSmad1 and hSmad1(N). It has recently been reported that calmodulin interacts with the N-terminal domain of Smad proteins. We demonstrate that the ventralizing activity of hsmad1 and hSmad1(N) is markedly inhibited by calmodulin. Thus, calmodulin acts as a Smad1 inhibitor. A model is proposed to accomodate these findings.

0033621489	Kinase activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Etk/BMX alone is sufficient to transactivate STAT-mediated gene expression in salivary and lung epithelial cells	Etk/BMX is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that requires a functional phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase via the pleckstrin homology domain to be activated by cytokine. In the present study, a conditionally active form of Etk was constructed by fusing the hormone-binding domain of estrogen receptor (ER) to an amino terminus truncated form of Etk, PHA1-68Etk, to generate ΔEtk:ER. In stably transfected Pa-4AEtk:ER cells, the activity of ΔEtk:ER was stimulated within minutes by the treatment of ΔEtk:ER stimulant, estradiol, and sustained for greater than 24 h. A robust induction in the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins, including STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5, was accompanied with ΔEtk:ER activation. Moreover, the conditionally activated Etk stimulated STAT1- and STAT5-dependent reporter activities by ~160- and ~15-fold, respectively, however, elicited only a modest STAT3-mediated reporter activation. Qualitatively comparable results were obtained in lung A549 cells, indicating that ΔEtk:ER inducible system could function in an analogous fashion in different epithelial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Etk activation alone augmented cyclin D1 promoter/enhancer activity via its STAT5 response element in both Pa-4ΔEtK:ER and A549 cells. Altogether, these findings support the notion that the activation of Etk kinase is sufficient to transactivate STAT-mediated gene expression. Hence, our inducible ΔEtK:ER system represents a novel approach to investigate the biochemical events following Etk activation and to evaluate the contribution by kinase activation of Etk alone or in conjunction with other signaling pathway(s) to the ultimate biological responses.

0034002476	Etk, a Btk family tyrosine kinase, mediates cellular transformation by linking src to STAT3 activation	Etk (also called Bmx) is a member of the Btk tyrosine kinase family and is expressed in a variety of hematopoietic, epithelial, and endothelial cells. We have explored biological functions, regulators, and effectors of Etk. Coexpression of v-Src and Etk led to a transphosphorylation on tyrosine 566 of Etk and subsequent autophosphorylation. These events correlated with a substantial increase in the kinase activity of Etk. STAT3, which was previously shown to be activated by Etk, associated with Etk in vivo. To investigate whether Etk could mediate v-Src-induced activation of STAT3 and cell transformation, we overexpressed a dominant-negative mutant of Etk in an immortalized, untransformed rat liver epithelial cell line, WB, which contains endogenous Etk. Dominant-negative inactivation of Etk not only blocked v-Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 but also caused a great reduction in the transforming activity of v-Src. In NIH3T3 cells, although Etk did not itself induce transformation, it effectively enhanced the transforming ability of a partially active c-Src mutant (c-Src378G). Furthermore, Etk activated STAT3-mediated gene expression in synergy with this Src mutant. Our findings thus indicate that Etk is a critical mediator of Src-induced cell transformation and STAT3 activation. The role of STAT3 in Etk-mediated transformation was also examined. Expression of Etk in a human hepatoma cell line Hep3B resulted in a significant increase in its transforming ability, and this effect was abrogated by dominant-negative inhibition of STAT3. These data strongly suggest that Etk links Src to STAT3 activation. Furthermore, Src-Etk-STAT3 is an important pathway in cellular transformation.

34248595692	SUMO modification modulates the transrepression activity of PLZF	Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification has recently been shown to associate with transcriptional regulation and nuclear body formation. Here, we show that transcription factor PLZF can be SUMO modified at lysine residue 242, 387 and 396. Converting these three SUMO acceptor Lys to Arg 3KR does not significantly affect PLZF nuclear body formation, which is distinct from the scenario of PML sumoylation in PML nuclear body formation. Furthermore, PLZF-3KR markedly reduced the transcriptional repression activity, correlating with a loss of PLZF-mediated growth suppression. These results reveal an important role of SUMO modification in PLZF-mediated transcriptional repression. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

58249093609	HLA-A33 is associated with susceptibility to enterovirus 71 infection	OBJECTIVE. Enterovirus 71 has caused large epidemics of disease, resulting in many fatalities and severe sequelae, in Taiwan and some other countries. In this study, host genetic factors were investigated to link susceptibility to and clinical severity of enterovirus 71 infections. METHODS. We enrolled 219 enterovirus 71 case subjects and 97 control children. HLA typing was performed with sequence-specific primers, and polymorphisms of immune-related candidate genes were detected with polymerase chain reaction, followed by automated gene sequencing. RESULTS. Of the 219 enterovirus 71 cases, 26% (56 of 219 cases) were uncomplicated cases, 74% (163 of 219 cases) were complicated cases, 57% (125 of 219 cases) were complicated cases with central nervous system involvement, and 17% (38 of 219 cases) involved cardiopulmonary failure after central nervous system involvement. Univariate analyses showed that tumor necrosis factor α promoter type II (-308 A allele), HLA-A33, and HLA-DR17 were significantly associated with enterovirus 71 susceptibility. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that HLA-A33 was the gene most significantly susceptible to enterovirus 71. HLA-A2 was associated with the development of cardiopulmonary failure. CONCLUSIONS. HLA-A33, which is a common phenotype in Asian populations but is rare in white populations, was most significantly associated with enterovirus 71 infection, compared with the other candidate genes we studied, whereas HLA-A2 was significantly related to cardiopulmonary failure.

0034731509	Protein-tyrosine phosphatase D1, a potential regulator and effector for Tec family kinases	Etk, also named Bmx, is a member of the Tec tyrosine kinase family, which is characterized by a multimodular structure including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, and a catalytic domain. The signaling mechanisms regulating Etk kinase activity remain largely unknown. To identify factor(s) regulating Etk activity, we used the PH domain and a linker region of Etk as a bait for a yeast two-hybrid screen. Three independent clones encoding protein-tyrosine phosphatase D1 (PTPDI) fragments were isolated. The binding of PTPD1 to Etk is specific since PTPD1 cannot associate with either the Akt PH domain or lamin. In vitro and in vivo binding studies demonstrated that PTPD1 can interact with Etk and that residues 726-848 of PTPD1 are essential for this interaction. Deletion analysis of Etk indicated that the PH domain is essential for PTPDI interaction. Furthermore, the Etk-PTPD1 interaction stimulated the kinase activity of Etk, resulting in an increased phosphotyrosine content in both factors. The Etk-PTPD1 interaction also increased Stat3 activation. The effect of PTPD1 on Etk activation is specific since PTPD1 cannot potentiate Jak2 activity upon Stat3 activation. In addition, Tec (but not Btk) kinase can also be activated by PTPDI. Taken together, these findings indicate that PTPD1 can selectively associate with and stimulate Tec family kinases and modulate Stat3 activation.

77954393655	Clathrin heavy chain mediates TACC3 targeting to mitotic spindles to ensure spindle stability	Mitotic spindles play essential roles in chromosome congression and segregation during mitosis. Aurora A regulates spindle assembly in part via phosphorylating human TACC3 on S558, which triggers TACC3 relocalization to mitotic spindles and stabilizes microtubules (MTs). In this study, we identified clathrin heavy chain (CHC) as an adaptor protein to recruit S558-phosphorylated TACC3 onto the spindle during mitosis for MT stabilization. CHC binds phospho-S558 TACC3 via its linker domain and first CHC repeat. CHC depletion or mutation on phospho-TACC3 binding abrogates TACC3 spindle relocalization. Depletion of either or both CHC and TACC3 yields similar defective phenotypes: loss of ch-TOG on spindles, disorganized spindles, and chromosome misalignment with comparable mitotic delay. Our findings elucidate the association between aurora A phosphorylation and spindle apparatus and demonstrate that regulation from aurora A is mediated by CHC in recruiting phospho-TACC3 and subsequently ch-TOG to mitotic spindles. © 2010 Lin et al.

42249109186	SUMOylation of HMGA2: Selective destabilization of promyelocytic leukemia protein via proteasome	The HMGA2 architectural protein functions in a variety of cellular processes, such as cell growth, transcription regulation, neoplastic transformation, and progression. Up-regulation of HMGA2 protein is observed in many tumors and is associated with advanced cancers with poor prognoses. Although the expression and biochemical properties of HMGA2 protein are regulated by microRNA and phosphorylation, it is unknown whether HMGA2 activity can also be regulated by SUMOylation, and that is what is investigated in this report. We identified HMGA2 as a SUMOylation target and showed that the expression of wild-type HMGA2, but not SUMOylation-defective HMGA2(2K/R), selectively lowered the steady-state level of PML protein. Consequently, the HMGA2-elicited PML down-regulation rendered a reduction in the average number of PML nuclear bodies per cell and the volume of PML assembled per PML nuclear body. Using small interfering RNA to suppress endogenous ubiquitin expression and proteasome inhibitor to repress ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, we showed that HMGA2 confers PML down-regulation through ubiquitin-proteasome- dependent protein degradation. Importantly, arsenic trioxide treatment stimulated HMGA2 SUMOylation, leading to the formation of HMGA2 nuclear foci surrounding PML nuclear bodies and the stimulation of PML degradation. Collectively, our results unveil a previously unrecognized effect by HMGA2 on the modulation of PML protein level, providing a novel mechanism underlying HMGA2 function and underscoring the molecular basis for oncogenic progression by HMGA2.

45549087530	Selective activation of NFAT by promyelocytic leukemia protein	Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is a tumor suppressor with complicated action mechanisms not yet fully understood. In this study, we found that the nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) is an unexpected partner of PML: PML specifically enhanced the transcription activation of NFAT. In PML-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, no transcription activity of NFAT could be detected. There was a selective requirement of PML isoform in NFAT activation: PML-I and PML-VI, but not PML-IV, increased NFAT transactivation. PML specifically promoted the expression of many, but not all, NFAT-targeted genes. We found a specific binding of PML to NFATc. The interaction of PML with NFATc in vivo was further confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA affinity precipitation assay analysis. The unexpected coupling of PML with NFAT reveals a novel mechanism underlying the diverse physiological functions of PML. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

4744346709	Stimulation of c-Rel transcriptional activity by PKA catalytic subunit β	Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a eukaryotic transcription factor which responds to different extracellular signals. It is involved in immune response, inflammation, and cell proliferation. Increased expression of c-Rel (or its viral homolog v-Rel), one component of the NF-κB factors, induces tumorigenesis in different systems. The activity of NF-κB can be regulated by protein kinase A (PKA) in a cAMP-independent manner. Our previous results showed that c-MYC induces the activity of PKA by inducing the transcription of the gene encoding the PKA catalytic subunit β (PKA-Cβ). Constitutive expression of PKA-Cβ in Rat1a cells induces their transformation. Here we show that CREB is unlikely to be a phosphorylation target of PKA-Cβ as characterized by different cell lines. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that c-Rel is present as a significant component of the NF-κB factors in c-MYC overexpressing status. The transcriptional activity of c-Rel was significantly stimulated by PKA-Cβ. Coactivators p300/CBP are at least partially responsible for the enhanced activation mediated by c-Rel and PKA-Cβ. Interaction between c-Rel and PKA-Cβ was demonstrated using coimmunoprecipitation assays. Immunoprecipitation-in vitro phosphorylation assays showed the direct phosphorylation of c-Rel by PKA-Cβ. These results indicate that c-Rel is a reasonable phosphorylation target of PKA-Cβ, and that the transcriptional activity of c-Rel is stimulated by PKA-Cβ possibly through the interaction with p300/CBP.

51349091041	Histone deacetylase 7 promotes PML sumoylation and is essential for PML nuclear body formation	Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) sumoylation has been proposed to control the formation of PML nuclear bodies (NBs) and is crucial for PML-dependent cellular processes, including apoptosis and transcriptional regulation. However, the regulatory mechanisms of PML sumoylation and its specific roles in the formation of PML NBs remain largely unknown. Here, we show that histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) knockdown reduces the size and the number of the PML NBs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HDAC7 coexpression stimulates PML sumoylation independent of its HDAC activity. Furthermore, HDAC7 associates with the E2 SUMO ligase, Ubc9, and stimulates PML sumoylation in vitro, suggesting that it possesses a SUMO E3 ligase-like activity to promote PML sumoylation. Importantly, HDAC7 knockdown inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced PML sumoylation and the formation of PML NBs in HUVECs. These results demonstrate a novel function of HDAC7 and provide a regulatory mechanism of PML sumoylation. Copyright © 2008, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

However, very little is known about the process of cell migration being modulated by SUMO modification. Here, we show that calpain-2, a protease involved in cell motility, can be SUMO modified at lysine residue 390. Converting the SUMO acceptor lysine residue to arginine residue significantly attenuated calpain-2 activity, correlating well with a loss of calpain-2-elicited cell motility. Accordingly, expression of SENP1 could abrogate calpain-2 sumoylation, causing an inhibition on calpain-2-dependent activity and cell motility. These results not only identify calpain-2 as a substrate for sumoylation but also provide an important role of sumoylation in regulating cell migration. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

67650485283	Daxx positively modulates β-catenin/TCF4-mediated transcriptional potential	Constitutive activation of the transcription factor TCF4 activity by mutated APC or β-catenin contributes to cell neoplastic transformation. While numerous proteins were identified to activate TCF4-dependent activity via β-catenin interaction, little is known about factors directly acting on TCF4. Here we report that Daxx binds to TCF4 and potentiates β-catenin/TCF4-mediated transcriptional activation and target gene expression. Binding studies revealed that Daxx-TCF4 interaction is through the C-terminal domain of Daxx and TCF4 segment containing amino acid residue 269-327. Alteration of Daxx levels in cells by overexpression or RNA interference resulted in an increase or decrease of the β-catenin/TCF4-dependent transactivation activity and target gene expression, respectively. Furthermore, TCF4-(269-327) segment acts as a dominantly negative mutant by blocking Daxx-TCF4 interaction and TCF4-mediated transactivation potential. Together, our results suggest that Daxx functions as a positive coregulator in modulating the β-catenin/TCF4-dependent transcriptional potential via TCF4 interaction. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

70449698023	Cdh1 controls the stability of TACC3	Transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3) was reported to be important for regulating mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. While the protein level of TACC3 was shown to be altered during cell cycle progression, the molecular mechanism in controlling TACC3 level is unclear. Here, we show that TACC3 protein level can be regulated by Cdh1, a well known activator of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. We identified Cdh1 as an interacting partner of TACC3 by a yeast array screen. Both in vitro and in vivo binding studies indicated that TACC3 can form complexes with Cdh1. Depletion of endogenous Cdh1 prolonged TACC3 protein level during mitotic exit. Alteration of Cdh1 level by ectopic overexpression or siRNA knockdown correlated well with an increase or decrease of ubiquitinated TACC3, respectively. Furthermore, the domain mapping studies of TACC3 revealed that multiple domains are involved in Cdh1-regulated degradation of TACC3. Altogether, our findings suggest that Cdh1 controls TACC3 protein stability during mitotic exit. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.

0035172209	Multiple signals required for cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) binding protein interaction induced by CD3/CD28 costimulation	The optimal activation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), similar to the full activation of T lymphocytes, requires the stimulation of both CD3 and CD28. Using a reporter system to detect interaction of CREB and CREB-binding protein (CBP), in this study we found that CREB binds to CBP only by engagement of both CD3 and CD28. CD3/CD28-promoted CREB-CBP interaction was dependent on p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) IV in addition to the previously identified extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase, CaMKIV, and p38 MAPK were also the kinases involved in CREB Ser

77952580741	The Cullin 3 substrate adaptor KLHL20 mediates DAPK ubiquitination to control interferon responses	Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) was identified as a mediator of interferon (IFN)-induced cell death. How IFN controls DAPK activation remains largely unknown. Here, we identify the BTB-Kelch protein KLHL20 as a negative regulator of DAPK. KLHL20 binds DAPK and Cullin 3 (Cul3) via its Kelch-repeat domain and BTB domain, respectively. The KLHL20-Cul3-ROC1 E3 ligase complex promotes DAPK polyubiquitination, thereby inducing the proteasomal degradation of DAPK. Accordingly, depletion of KLHL20 diminishes DAPK ubiquitination and degradation. The KLHL20-mediated DAPK ubiquitination is suppressed in cells receiving IFN-α or IFN-γ, which induces an enrichment/sequestration of KLHL20 in the PML nuclear bodies, thereby separating KLHL20 from DAPK. Consequently, IFN triggers the stabilization of DAPK. This mechanism of DAPK stabilization is crucial for determining IFN responsiveness of tumor cells and contributes to IFN-induced autophagy. This study identifies KLHL20-Cul3-ROC1 as an E3 ligase for DAPK ubiquitination and reveals a regulatory mechanism of DAPK, through blocking its accessibility to this E3 ligase, in IFN-induced apoptotic and autophagic death. Our findings may be relevant to the problem of IFN resistance in cancer therapy. © 2010 European Molecular Biology Organization.

The mammalian SUMO family includes four paralogues, SUMO-1 through SUMO-4. Death-associated protein-6, Daxx, is a 740 residue important transcription corepressor known to represses transcriptional potential of several sumolyted transcription factors. Daxx also plays important role in apoptosis. Both terminals of Daxx harbor separate SUMO Interaction Motifs (SIM), which mediate its interaction with SUMO and hence the sumolyted transcription factors.

0035807216	MST4, a new Ste20-related kinase that mediates cell growth and transformation via modulating ERK pathway	In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel human Ste20-related kinase that we designated MST4 (accession number AF231012). The 416 amino acid full-length MST4 contains an amino-terminal kinase domain, which is highly homologous to MST3 and SOK, and a unique carboxy-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis indicated that MST4 is highly expressed in placenta, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Wild-type but not kinase-dead MST4 can phosphorylate myelin basic protein in an in vitro kinase assay. MST4 specifically activates ERK but not JNK or p38 MAPK in transient transfected cells or in stable cell lines. Overexpression of dominant negative MEK1 or treatment with PD98059 abolishes MST4-induced ERK activity, whereas dominant-negative Ras or c-Raf-1 mutants failed to do so, indicating MST4 activates MEK1/ERK via a Ras/Raf-1 independent pathway. HeLa and Phoenix cell lines overexpressing wild-type, but not kinase-dead, MST4 exhibit increased growth rate and form aggressive soft-agar colonies. These phenotypes can be inhibited by PD98059. These results provide the first evidence that MST4 is biologically active in the activation of MEK/ERK pathway and in mediating cell growth and transformation.

0035918324	Reciprocal Regulatory Interaction between Human Herpesvirus 8 and Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1	Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) is the primary viral etiologic agent in Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). However, individuals dually infected with both HHV8 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) show an enhanced prevalence of KS when compared with those singularly infected with HHV8. Host immune suppression conferred by HIV infection cannot wholly explain this increased presentation of KS. To better understand how HHV8 and HIV-1 might interact directly in the pathogenesis of KS, we queried for potential regulatory interactions between the two viruses. Here, we report that HHV8 and HIV-1 reciprocally up-regulate the gene expression of each other. We found that the KIE2 immediate-early gene product of HHV8 interacted synergistically with Tat in activating expression from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. On the other hand, HIV-1 encoded Tat and Vpr proteins increased intracellular HHVS-specific expression. These results provide molecular insights correlating coinfection with HHV8 and HIV-1 with an unusually high incidence of KS.

0035920120	The Cellular Protein PRA1 Modulates the Anti-apoptotic Activity of Epstein-Barr Virus BHRF1, a Homologue of Bcl-2, through Direct Interaction	The Epstein-Barr virus-encoded early protein, BHRF1, is a structural and functional homologue of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2. There is accumulating evidence that BHRF1 protects a variety of cell types from apoptosis induced by various external stimuli. To identify specific proteins from normal epithelial cells that interact with BHRF1 and that might promote or inhibit its anti-apoptotic activity, we screened a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library derived from human normal foreskin keratinocytes and identified a cellular gene encoding human prenylated rab acceptor 1 (hPRA1). The interaction of hPRA1 with BHRF1 was confirmed using glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation. Two regions of PRA1, amino acids 30-53 and the carboxyl-terminal 21 residues, are important for BHRF1 interactions and two regions of BHRF1, amino acids 1-18 and 89-142, including the Bcl-2 homology domains BH4 and BH1, respectively, are crucial for PRA1 interactions. PRA1 expression interferes with the anti-apoptotic activity of BHRF1, although not of Bcl-2. These results indicate that the PRA1 interacts selectively with BHRF1 to reduce its anti-apoptotic activity and might play a role in the impeding completion of virus maturation.

0036272305	Increased p300 expression inhibits glucocorticoid receptor-T-cell receptor antagonism but does not affect thymocyte positive selection	Positive selection of T cells is postulated to be dependent on the counterinteraction between glucocorticoid receptor (GR)- and T-cell-receptor (TCR)-induced death signals. In this study we used T-cell-specific expression of p300 to investigate whether GR-TCR cross talk between thymocytes was affected. Activation of the p300-transgenic T cells led to enhanced thymocyte proliferation and increased interleukin 2 production. Thymocyte death, induced by TCR engagement, was no longer prevented by dexamethasone in p300-transgenic mice, indicating an absence of GR-TCR cross-inhibition. This was accompanied by a 50% reduction in the number of thymocytes in p300-transgenic mice. However, the CD4/CD8 profile of thymocytes remained unchanged in p300-transgenic mice. There was no effect on positive selection of the bulk thymocytes or thymocytes with transgenic TCR in p300-transgenic mice. In addition, there was no apparent TCR repertoire "hole" in the selected antigens examined. Our results illustrate a critical role of CBP/p300 in thymic GR-TCR counterinteraction yet do not support the involvement of GR-TCR antagonism in thymocyte positive selection.

79959419265	High-mobility group A2 protein modulates hTERT transcription to promote tumorigenesis	The high-mobility group A2 gene (HMGA2) is one of the most frequently amplified genes in human cancers. However, functions of HMGA2 in tumorigenesis are not fully understood due to limited knowledge of its targets in tumor cells. Our study reveals a novel link between HMGA2 and the regulation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic subunit of telomerase, which offers critical insight into how HMGA2 contributes to tumorigenesis. The expression of HMGA2 modulates the expression of hTERT, resulting in cells with enhanced telomerase activities and increased telomere length. Treatment with suberoylanilide hydroxamide (SAHA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, causes dose-dependent hTERT reporter activation, mimicking HMGA2 overexpression. By interacting with Sp1, HMGA2 interferes with the recruitment of HDAC2 to the hTERT proximal promoter, enhancing localized histone H3-K9 acetylation and thereby stimulating hTERT expression and telomerase activity. Moreover, HMGA2 knockdown by short hairpin HMGA2 in HepG2 cells leads to progressive telomere shortening and a concurrent decrease of steady-state hTERT mRNA levels, attenuating their ability to form colonies in soft agar. Importantly, HMGA2 partially replaces the function of hTERT during the tumorigenic transformation of normal human fibroblasts. These findings are potentially clinically relevant, because HMGA2 expression is reported to be upregulated in a number of human cancers as telomere maintenance is essential for tumorigenesis. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

80051583598	A Cullin3-KLHL20 Ubiquitin Ligase-Dependent Pathway Targets PML to Potentiate HIF-1 Signaling and Prostate Cancer Progression	Tumor hypoxia is associated with disease progression and treatment failure, but the hypoxia signaling mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we show that KLHL20, a Cullin3 (Cul3) substrate adaptor induced by HIF-1, coordinates with the actions of CDK1/2 and Pin1 to mediate hypoxia-induced PML proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, this PML destruction pathway participates in a feedback mechanism to maximize HIF-1α induction, thereby potentiating multiple tumor hypoxia responses, including metabolic reprogramming, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, tumor growth, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance. In human prostate cancer, overexpression of HIF-1α, KLHL20, and Pin1 correlates with PML down-regulation, and hyperactivation of the PML destruction pathway is associated with disease progression. Our study indicates that the KLHL20-mediated PML degradation and HIF-1α autoregulation play key roles in tumor progression. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

80052413411	Sumoylation-promoted enterovirus 71 3C degradation correlates with a reduction in viral replication and cell apoptosis	Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a member of the Picornaviridae family, may cause serious clinical manifestations associated with the central nervous system. Enterovirus 3C protease is required for virus replication and can trigger host cell apoptosis via cleaving viral polyprotein precursor and cellular proteins, respectively. Although the role of the 3C protease in processing viral and cellular proteins has been established, very little is known about the modulation of EV71 3C function by host cellular factors. Here, we show that sumoylation promotes EV71 3C protein ubiquitination for degradation, correlating with a decrease of EV71 in virus replication and cell apoptosis. SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 was identified as an EV71 3C-interacting protein. Further studies revealed that EV71 3C can be SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier)-modified at residue Lys-52. Sumoylation down-regulated 3C protease activity in vitro and also 3C protein stability in cells, in agreement with data suggesting 3C K52R protein induced greater substrate cleavage and apoptosis in cells. More importantly, the recombinant EV71 3C K52R virus infection conferred more apoptotic phenotype and increased virus levels in culture cells, which also correlated with a mouse model showing increased levels of viral VP1 protein in intestine and neuron loss in the spinal cord with EV71 3C K52R recombinant viral infection. Finally, we show that EV71 3C amino acid residues 45-52 involved in Ubc9 interaction determined the extent of 3C sumoylation and protein stability. Our results uncover a previously undescribed cellular regulatory event against EV71 virus replication and host cell apoptosis by sumoylation at 3C protease. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84862498489	Location and level of Etk expression in neurons are associated with varied severity of traumatic brain injury	Background: Much recent research effort in traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been devoted to the discovery of a reliable biomarker correlating with severity of injury. Currently, no consensus has been reached regarding a representative marker for traumatic brain injury. In this study, we explored the potential of epithelial/endothelial tyrosine kinase (Etk) as a novel marker for TBI. Methodology/Principal Findings: TBI was induced in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats by controlled cortical impact. Brain tissue samples were analyzed by Western blot, Q-PCR, and immunofluorescence staining using various markers including glial fibrillary acidic protein, and epithelial/endothelial tyrosine kinase (Etk). Results show increased Etk expression with increased number and severity of impacts. Expression increased 2.36 to 7-fold relative to trauma severity. Significant upregulation of Etk appeared at 1 hour after injury. The expression level of Etk was inversely correlated with distance from injury site. Etk and trauma/inflammation related markers increased post-TBI, while other tyrosine kinases did not. Conclusion/Significance: The observed correlation between Etk level and the number of impacts, the severity of impact, and the time course after impact, as well as its inverse correlation with distance away from injury site, support the potential of Etk as a possible indicator of trauma severity. © 2012 Wu et al.

Several reports indicate that proteins binding to CREB and/or CBP play important roles in modulating the CREB-dependent transactivation. Here, we show that Daxx interacts with CREB and modulates CREB-mediated transcription. Daxx was identified as a CREB-interacting protein by a yeast two-hybrid screen. Depletion of endogenous Daxx by specific shRNA or overexpression of Daxx resulted in decreased or increased levels of the cAMP/PKA-induced reporter activity and target gene expression, respectively. In vitro and in vivo binding studies revealed that Daxx C-terminal domain binds to CREB basic leucine zipper domain. The binding of Daxx to CREB correlates with its repressive effect on a CRE-mediated reporter activity induced by forskolin or PKA. Furthermore, the results of electrophoresis mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Daxx attenuated the DNA binding potential of the CREB. Our study provides a previously undescribed role of Daxx in repressing cAMP-responsive gene expression and also a mechanism underlying the repressive effect of Daxx on CREB transcriptional potential. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

84863174863	Death-associated protein 6 (Daxx) mediates cAMP-dependent stimulation of Cyp11a1 (P450scc) transcription	SF-1 is a key transcription factor for all steroidogenic genes. It up-regulates the expression of the steroidogenic Cyp11a1 gene in the adrenal in a pathway stimulated by cAMP through HIPK3-mediated JNK/c-Jun phosphorylation. In the present study, we have investigated the factors mediating cAMP-dependent HIPK3 action to potentiate the activity of SF-1 for Cyp11a1 transcription in mouse adrenocortical Y1 cells. We found Daxx, a HIPK kinase substrate in the apoptosis pathway, was phosphorylated by HIPK3 at Ser-669 in response to cAMP stimulation. Daxx participated in SF-1-dependent Cyp11a1 expression as shown by experiments involving both overexpression and down-regulation via a dominant negative Daxx mutant. The S669A mutant of Daxx, which could not be phosphorylated by HIPK3, lost the ability to potentiate SF-1 activity for Cyp11a1 expression. The enhancement of SF-1 activity by Daxx required JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. Thus, Daxx functioned as a signal transducer linking cAMP-stimulated HIPK3 activity with JNK/c-Jun phosphorylation and SF-1-dependent Cyp11a1 transcription for steroid synthesis. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84863298470	Identification of an AAA ATPase VPS4B-dependent pathway that modulates epidermal growth factor receptor abundance and signaling during hypoxia	VPS4B, an AAA ATPase (ATPase associated with various cellular activities), participates in vesicular trafficking and autophagosome maturation in mammalian cells. In solid tumors, hypoxia is a common feature and an indicator of poor treatment outcome. Our studies demonstrate that exogenous or endogenous (assessed with anchorage-independent three-dimensional multicellular spheroid culture) hypoxia induces VPS4B downregulation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Inhibition of VPS4B function by short hairpin VPS4B (sh-VPS4B) or expression of dominant negative VPS4B(E235Q) promotes anchorageindependent breast cancer cell growth and resistance to gefitinib, U0126, and genotoxicity. Biochemically, hyperactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase essential for cell proliferation and survival, accompanied by increased EGFR accumulation and altered intracellular compartmentalization, is observed in cells with compromised VPS4B. Furthermore, enhanced FOS/JUN induction and AP-1 promoter activation are noted in EGF-treated cells with VPS4B knockdown. However, VPS4B depletion does not affect EGFRvIII stability or its associated signaling. An inverse correlation between VPS4B expression and EGFR abundance is observed in breast tumors, and high-grade or recurrent breast carcinomas exhibit lower VPS4B expression. Together, our findings highlight a potentially critical role of VPS4B downregulation or chronichypoxia- induced VPS4B degradation in promoting tumor progression, unveiling a nongenomic mechanism for EGFR overproduction in human breast cancer. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

84866146382	HTLV-1 tax-induced rapid senescence is driven by the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and depends on chronically activated IKKα and p65/RelA	The HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax is a ptent activator of classical and alternative NF-κB pathways and is thought to promote cell proliferation and transformation via NF-κB activation. We showed recently that hyperactivation of NF-κB by Tax triggers a cellular senescence response (H. Zhi et al., PLoS Pathog. 7:e1002025, 2011). Inhibition of NF-κB activation by expression of I-κBα superrepressor or by small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of p65/RelA rescues cells from Tax-induced rapid senescence (Tax-IRS). Here we demonstrate that Tax-IRS is driven by the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Knockdown of IKKγ, the primary Tax target, by shRNAs abrogated Tax-mediated activation of both classical and alternative NF-κB pathways and rendered knockdown cells resistant to Tax-IRS. Consistent with a critical role of IKKα in the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, IKKα deficiency drastically decreased NF-κB trans-activation by Tax, although it only modestly reduced Tax-mediated I-κBα degradation and NF-κB nuclear localization. In contrast, although IKKβ knockdown attenuated Tax-induced NF-κB transcriptional activation, the residual NF-κB activation in IKKβ-deficient cells was sufficient to trigger Tax-IRS. Importantly, the phenotypes of NIK and TAK1 knockdown were similar to those of IKKα and IKKβ knockdown, respectively. Finally, double knockdown of RelB and p100 had a minor effect on senescence induction by Tax. These data suggest that Tax, through its interaction with IKKγ, helps recruit NIK and TAK1 for IKKα and IKKβ activation, respectively. In the presence of Tax, the delineation between the classical and alternative NF-κB pathways becomes obscured. The senescence checkpoint triggered by Tax is driven by the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, which depends on activated IKKα and p65/RelA. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

0037067668	Essential role of the 58-kDA microspherule protein in the modulation of Daxx-dependent transcriptional repression as revealed by nucleolar sequestration	Daxx has been reported to mediate the Fas/JNK-dependent signals in the cytoplasm.

Recent studies have further indicated that Daxx-elicited transcriptional repression can be inhibited by the nuclear body-associated promyelocytic leukemia protein and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 by sequestering Daxx to the nuclear bodies and the cytoplasm, respectively. Here, we further investigated the coordinated molecular mechanism by which Daxx function is regulated through protein-protein interaction. Using yeast two-hybrid screens to identify Daxx-interacting protein(s), three independent clones encoding the 58-kDa microspherule protein (MSP58) fragments were identified.

0037069931	Coordinating Etk/Bmx activation and VEGF upregulation to promote cell survival and proliferation	Etk/Bmx, a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is characterized by an N-terminal PH domain and has recently been shown to be involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, motility and apoptosis. Since VEGF and the activation of its signaling pathway have been implicated in modulating a variety of biological responses, we characterized the role of Etk-dependent signaling pathways involved in the upregulation of VEGF expression, and explored the functional implications of this enhancement in sustaining cell proliferation and survival. Using Northern and Western analyses, transient transfections, and pharmacological agents, we demonstrate that Etk activation alone is sufficient to transcriptionally induce VEGF expression, independent of the previously identified hypoxia response element (HRE), in both Pa-4 epithelial and TR-BBB endothelial cells under normoxia. In addition, Etk utilizes both MEK/ERK and PI3-K/Pak1 signaling pathways in concert to activate VEGF transcription. Functionally, Etk activation elicits a profound stimulatory effect on TR-BBB cell proliferation and formation of capillary-like networks in Matrigel containing reduced levels of growth factors. Finally, antisense oligonucleotides against either endogenous VEGF or Etk abrogate the proliferation of Etk-activated TR-BBB cells, and exogenous VEGF treatment stimulates endogenous Etk tyrosine phosphorylation in HUVECs. Taken together, these results indicate that VEGF is both an Etk downstream target gene and an Etk upstream activator, constituting a reciprocal Etk-VEGF autoregulatory loop. These findings, to our knowledge, are the first delineation of a network of positive feedforward signaling pathways that converge on the Etk-VEGF axis, causally associating Etk-mediation of VEGF induction with enhanced cellular processes in both epithelial and endothelial cells.

0037507271	Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) functions as a glucocorticoid receptor co-activator by sequestering Daxx to the PML oncogenic domains (PODs) to enhance its transactivation potential	Daxx has been reported to function as a transcriptional modulator in the nucleus. In the present study, we have explored the role of Daxx in regulating the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Overexpression of Daxx suppressed GR-mediated activation of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in COS-1, HeLa, and 293T cells. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that Daxx could directly bind to GR. The mapping analysis further demonstrated that the C-terminal region of Daxx-(501-740) mediates the interaction and transcriptional repression of GR. The repressive effect of Daxx and Daxx-(501-740) on GR could be alleviated by co-expression of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis showed that overexpression of wild-type PML results in the translocation of Daxx and Daxx-(501-740) to the PML oncogenic domains (PODs). By contrast, a PML PA sumoylation-defective mutant failed to recruit Daxx to PODs and to reverse the Daxx repression effect on GR. Accordingly, AS

84870661687	Different sham procedures for rats in traumatic brain injury experiments induce corresponding increases in levels of trauma markers	Background: In traumatic brain injury animal models, sham or naïve control groups are often used for the analysis of injured animals; however, the existence and/or significance of differences in the control groups has yet to be studied. In addition, recent controversies regarding the decompressive craniectomy trial in which decompressive craniectomies in patients with severe traumatic brain injury and refractory increased intracranial pressure remains unsettled. Although the report demonstrated that the procedure may result in less favorable long-term outcomes despite the decrease in intracranial pressure and shorter length of intensive care unit stay, the study has been criticized, and the debate is still inconclusive partly because of a lack of mechanistic explanation. We have recently discovered epithelial and endothelial tyrosine kinase (Etk) to exhibit upregulation after traumatic neural injury and will compare the effects of craniectomy procedure with those of other procedures inducing different levels of severity. Materials and methods: Four groups of rats receiving different procedures (controlled cortical impact, craniectomy, bicortical drilling, and unicortical drilling [UD]) were compared. Polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and immunoflorescence staining of Etk, S100, and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels were used to analyze the results and compare the different groups. Results: Etk upregulation was statistically significant between craniectomy and UD groups. The level of change for glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100 was only significant when cortex was impacted. Conclusions: UD may be preferable as a sham control procedure over craniectomy or bicortical drilling. Increases in the expression of Etk in the craniectomy group suggest a possible mechanism by which unfavorable outcome occurs in patients receiving craniectomy procedures. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84875460764	Ubc9 acetylation modulates distinct SUMO target modification and hypoxia response	While numerous small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugated substrates have been identified, very little is known about the cellular signalling mechanisms that differentially regulate substrate sumoylation. Here, we show that acetylation of SUMO E2 conjugase Ubc9 selectively downregulates the sumoylation of substrates with negatively charged amino acid-dependent sumoylation motif (NDSM) consisting of clustered acidic residues located downstream from the core ψ-K-X-E/D consensus motif, such as CBP and Elk-1, but not substrates with core ψ-K-X-E/D motif alone or SUMO-interacting motif. Ubc9 is acetylated at residue K65 and K65 acetylation attenuates Ubc9 binding to NDSM substrates, causing a reduction in NDSM substrate sumoylation. Furthermore, Ubc9 K65 acetylation can be downregulated by hypoxia via SIRT1, and is correlated with hypoxia-elicited modulation of sumoylation and target gene expression of CBP and Elk-1 and cell survival. Our data suggest that Ubc9 acetylation/deacetylation serves as a dynamic switch for NDSM substrate sumoylation and we report a previously undescribed SIRT1/Ubc9 regulatory axis in the modulation of protein sumoylation and the hypoxia response. © 2013 European Molecular Biology Organization.

Therefore, unraveling the underlying mechanisms of the DDR is important for understanding tumor suppression and cellular resistance to clastogenic cancer therapeutics. Because the DDR is likely to be influenced by chromatin regulation at the sites of DNA damage, we investigated the role of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) during the DDR process. We monitored double-strand breaks (DSBs) using the γH2AX foci marker and found that depleting cells of HP1 caused genotoxic stress, a delay in the repair of DSBs and elevated levels of apoptosis after irradiation. Furthermore, we found that these defects in repair were associated with impaired BRCA1 function.

84880063596	SENP1 deSUMOylates and regulates pin1 protein activity and cellular function	The Pin1 prolyl isomerase regulates phosphorylation signaling by controlling protein conformation after phosphorylation, and its upregulation promotes oncogenesis via acting on numerous oncogenic molecules. SUMOylation and deSUMOylation are dynamic mechanisms regulating a spectrum of protein activities. The SUMO proteases (SENP) remove SUMO conjugate from proteins, and their expression is deregulated in cancers. However, nothing is known about the role of SUMOylation in regulating Pin1 function. Here, we show that Pin1 is SUMOylated on Lys6 in theWWdomain and on Lys63 in the PPIase domain. Pin1 SUMOylation inhibits its protein activity and oncogenic function. We further identify that SENP1 binds to and deSUMOylates Pin1. Importantly, either overexpression of SENP1 or disruption of Pin1 SUMOylation promotes the ability of Pin1 to induce centrosome amplification and cell transformation. Moreover, SENP1 also increases Pin1 protein stability in cell cultures, and Pin1 levels are positively correlated with SENP1 levels in human breast cancer specimens. These results not only uncover Pin1 SUMOylation on Lys6/63 as a novel mechanism to inhibit its activity and function but also identify a critical role for SENP1-mediated deSUMOylation in promoting Pin1 function during tumorigenesis. © 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.

84880443531	HIC1 interacts with and modulates the activity of STAT3	HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer 1) is a tumor suppressor gene, expression of which is frequently suppressed in human cancers. Very little is known about the molecular basis of HIC1 in antagonizing oncogenic pathways. Here, we report that HIC1 forms complexes with the signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and attenuates STAT3- mediated transcription. STAT3 was identified as a HIC1-interacting protein by affinity capture and followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Overexpression or depletion of HIC1 resulted in decreased or increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6)/oncostatin M (OSM)-induced STAT3-mediated reporter activity and expression of target genes such as VEGF and c-Myc, respectively. Furthermore, HIC1 suppressing the VEGF and c-Myc promoter activity and the colony formation of MDA-MB 231 cells were STAT3-dependent. Further studies showed that HIC1 interacts with the DNA binding domain of STAT3 and suppresses the binding of STAT3 to its target gene promoters. Domain mapping study revealed that HIC1 C-terminal domain binds to STAT3. HIC1 mutant defective in STAT3 interaction reduced its repressive effect on STAT3 DNA binding activity, the reporter activity and gene expression of the VEGF and c-Myc genes, and cell growth in MDA-MB 231 cells. Altogether, our findings not only provide a novel role of HIC1 in antagonizing STAT3-mediated activation of VEGF and c-Myc gene expression and cell growth, but also elucidate a molecular basis underlying the inhibitory effect of HIC1 on STAT3 transcriptional potential. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

84881518308	The PML isoform IV is a negative regulator of nuclear EGFR's transcriptional activity in lung cancer	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase, which can transduce intracellular signals responsible for cell proliferation. It is frequently overexpressed and/or constitutively activated in non-small cell lung cancer and thus is considered as a major cause of this disease. Recently, EGFR has been found in the nucleus where the nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) can function as a transcription factor activating the transcription of genes such as cyclin D1 gene (CCND1), which is essential for cell proliferation. Nevertheless, how nEGFR's transcriptional activity is regulated remains unclear. Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is a tumor suppressor, which is lost in various cancers including lung cancer. However, the role of PML in the suppression of lung cancer growth is still unclear. When we investigated the role of PML in the regulation of lung cancer cell growth, we found that PML isoform IV (PMLIV) preferentially represses the growth of lung cancer cells bearing constitutively active EGFR. Besides, when growing in the EGFR activating conditions, the growth of EGFR wild-type bearing A549 cells has been repressed by PMLIV overexpression. We also found that PMLIV can interact physically with nEGFR and represses the transcription of nEGFR target genes. We showed that PMLIV is recruited by nEGFR to the target promoters and reduces the promoter histone acetylation level via HDAC1. Together, our results suggest that PMLIV interacts with nEGFR upon EGFR activation and represses the transcription of nEGFR target genes such as CCND1 and thus leading to inhibition of the lung cancer cell growth. © The Author 2013.

84886799764	The deubiquitinating enzyme USP37 regulates the oncogenic fusion protein PLZF/RARA stability	Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is predominantly characterized by chromosomal translocations between the retinoic acid receptor, alpha (RARA) gene and the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) or promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) gene. In APL cells with PML/RARA fusions, arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid treatments specifically target the fusion protein for proteasome-dependent degradation, thereby promoting cellular differentiation and clinical remission of disease. In contrast, APL cells expressing PLZF/RARA fusion proteins are largely resistant to similar treatments and prognosis for patients with this translocation is poor. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating PLZF/RARA protein stability would provide novel therapeutic targets for PLZF/RARA-associated APL. Toward this end, we have performed an RNAi-based screen to identify factors affecting PLZF/RARA stability. Among the factors identified was the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 37 (USP37). We showed that USP37 interacted with PLZF/RARA through the PLZF moiety and sustained PLZF/RARA steady state levels. Domain mapping study revealed that N-terminal domain of USP37 is required for the PLZF/RARA interaction and protein regulation. Furthermore, overexpression or depletion of USP37 caused an increase or decrease of PLZF/RARA protein half-life, correlating with down- or upregulation of PLZF/RARA poly-ubiquitination, respectively. By PLZF/RARA-transduced primary mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells, we demonstrated that Usp37 knockdown alleviated PLZF/RARA-mediated target gene suppression and cell transformation potential. Altogether, our findings of USP37-modulating PLZF/RARA stability and cell transformation suggest that USP37 is a potential therapeutic target for PLZF/RARA-associated APL. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

0041689978	Nuclear factor of activated T cells c is a target of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in T cells	p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) is essential for T-cell activation. Here we demonstrated that nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is a direct target of p38 MAPK. Inhibition of p38 MAPK led to selective inactivation of NFAT in T cells. We further linked a strict requirement of p38 MAPK to activation of NFATc. A stimulatory effect of p38 MAPK on at least four other stages of NFATc activation was found. First, the p38 MAPK cascade activated the NFATc promoter and induced the transcription of NFATc mRNA. Second, p38 MAPK mildly increased the mRNA stability of NFATc. Third, p38 MAPK enhanced the translation of NFATc mRNA. Fourth, p38 MAPK promoted the interaction of NFATc with the coactivator CREB-binding protein. In contrast, p38 MAPK moderately enhanced the expulsion of NFATc from the nucleus in T cells. Therefore, p38 MAPK has opposite effects on different stages of NFATc activation. All together, the overall effect of p38 MAPK on NFATc in T cells is clear activation.

84904670337	Structural analysis of poly-SUMO chain recognition by the RNF4-SIMs domain	The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF4 (RING finger protein 4) contains four tandem SIM [SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier)-interaction motif] repeats for selective interaction with poly-SUMO-modified proteins, which it targets for degradation. We employed a multi-faceted approach to characterize the structure of the RNF4-SIMs domain and the tetra-SUMO2 chain to elucidate the interaction between them. In solution, the SIM domainwas intrinsically disordered and the linkers of the tetra-SUMO2 were highly flexible. Individual SIMs of the RNF4-SIMs domains bind to SUMO2 in the groove between the β2-strand and the α1-helix parallel to the β2-strand. SIM2 and SIM3 bound to SUMO with a high affinity and together constituted the recognition module necessary for SUMO binding. SIM4 alone bound to SUMO with low affinity; however, its contribution to tetra-SUMO2 binding avidity is comparable with that of SIM3 when in the RNF4-SIMs domain. The SAXS data of the tetra-SUMO2-RNF4-SIMs domain complex indicate that it exists as an ordered structure. The HADDOCK model showed that the tandem RNF4-SIMs domain bound antiparallel to the tetra-SUMO2 chain orientation and wrapped around the SUMO protamers in a superhelical turn without imposing steric hindrance on either molecule. © The Authors Journal compilation © 2014 Biochemical Society.

84905377390	An arginine-rich motif of ring finger protein 4 (RNF4) oversees the recruitment and degradation of the phosphorylated and SUMOylated Krüppel-associated box domain-associated protein 1 (KAP1)/TRIM28 protein during genotoxic stress	Krüppel-associated box domain-associated protein 1 (KAP1) is a universal transcriptional corepressor that undergoes multiple posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including SUMOylation and Ser-824 phosphorylation. However, the functional interplay of KAP1 PTMs in regulating KAP1 turnover during DNA damage response remains unclear. To decipher the role and cross-talk of multiple KAP1 PTMs, we show here that DNA double strand break-induced KAP1 Ser-824 phosphorylation promoted the recruitment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase, ring finger protein 4(RNF4), and subsequent RNF4-mediated, SUMO-dependent degradation. Besides the SUMO interacting motif (SIM), a previously unrecognized, but evolutionarily conserved, argininerich motif (ARM) in RNF4 acts as a novel recognition motif for selective target recruitment. Results from combined mutagenesis and computational modeling studies suggest that RNF4 utilizes concerted bimodular recognition, namely SIM for Lys-676 SUMOylation and ARM for Ser(P)-824 of simultaneously phosphorylated and SUMOylated KAP1 (Ser(P)-824-SUMO-KAP1). Furthermore, we proved that arginines 73 and 74 within the ARM of RNF4 are required for efficient recruitment to KAP1 or accelerated degradation of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) under stress. In parallel, results of bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays validated the role of the ARM in recognizing Ser(P)-824 in living cells. Taken together, we establish that the ARM is required for RNF4 to efficiently target Ser(P)-824-SUMO-KAP1, conferring ubiquitin Lys-48-mediated proteasomal degradation in the context of double strand breaks. The conservation of such a motif may possibly explain the requirement for timely substrate selectivity determination among a myriad of SUMOylated proteins under stress conditions. Thus, the ARM dynamically regulates the SIM-dependent recruitment of targets to RNF4, which could be critical to dynamically fine-tune the abundance of Ser(P)-824-SUMOKAP1and, potentially, other SUMOylated proteins duringDNA damage response. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84907560655	Urinary Xist is a potential biomarker for membranous nephropathy	Membranous nephropathy (MN), a type of glomerular nephritis, is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in human adults. Changes in gene expression as a result of epigenetic dysregulation through long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly being recognized as important factors in disease. Using an experimental MN mouse model, we identify the first dysregulated lncRNAs, Xist and NEAT1, whose levels are significantly upregulated in both tubular epithelial and glomerular cells. MN is also often characterized by glomerular podocyte injury. Treatment of a mouse podocyte cell line with lipopolysaccharides to induce injury resulted in the stable elevation of Xist, but not NEAT1 levels. In mice, the observed changes in Xist levels are specific: Xist can be effectively detected in urine, with a strong correlation to disease severity, but not serum in MN samples. We find that regulation of Xist may be controlled by post-translational modifications. H3K27me3 levels are significantly downregulated in mouse MN kidney, where chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments also showed decreased H3K27me3 at Xist promoter regions. Finally, we show that our findings in mice can be extended to human clinical samples. Urinary Xist is significantly elevated in urine samples from patients with different types of glomerular nephritis, including MN, compared to normal counterparts. Together, our results suggest that a reduction of H3K27me3 at Xist promoter regions leads to elevated levels of urinary Xist, which may be used as a biomarker to detect MN.

10044264506	Negative modulation of androgen receptor transcriptional activity by Daxx	The transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR) modulated by positive or negative regulators plays a critical role in controlling the growth and survival of prostate cancer cells. Although numerous positive regulators have been identified, negative regulators of AR are less well understood. We report here that Daxx functions as a negative AR coregulator through direct protein-protein interactions. Overexpression of Daxx suppressed AR-mediated promoter activity in COS-1 and LNCaP cells and AR-mediated prostate-specific antigen expression in LNCaP cells. Conversely, downregulation of endogenous Daxx expression by RNA interference enhances androgen-induced prostate-specific antigen expression in LNCaP cells. In vitro and in vivo interaction studies revealed that Daxx binds to both the amino-terminal and the DNA-binding domain of the AR. Daxx proteins interfere with the AR DNA-binding activity both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, sumoylation of AR at its amino-terminal domain is involved in Daxx interaction and trans-repression. Together, these findings not only provide a novel role of Daxx in controlling AR transactivation activity but also uncover the mechanism underlying sumoylation-dependent transcriptional repression of the AR.

84922059521	Large isoform of mammalian relative of dnaJ is a major determinant of human susceptibility to HIV-1 infection	Individual differences in susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection have been of interest for decades. We aimed to determine the contribution of large isoform of Mammalian DnaJ (MRJ-L), a HIV-1 Vpr-interacting cellular protein, to this natural variation. Expression ofMRJ-L in monocyte-derived macrophages was significantly higher in HIV-infected individuals (n=31) than their uninfected counterparts (n=27) (p= 0.009). Fifty male homosexual subjects (20 of them are HIV-1 positive) were further recruited to examine the association between MRJ-L levels and occurrence of HIV infection. Bayesian multiple logistic regression revealed that playing a receptive role and increased levels of MRJ-L in macrophages were two risk factors for HIV-1 infection. A 1% rise in MRJ-L expression was associated with a 1.13 fold (95% CrI 1.06-1.29) increase in odds of contracting HIV-1 infection. Ex vivo experiments revealed that MRJ-L facilitated Vpr-dependent nuclear localization of virus. Infection ofmacrophage-tropic strain is a critical step in HIV-1 transmission.MRJ-L is a critical factor in this process; hence, subjects with higher macrophage MRJ-L levels are more vulnerable to HIV-1 infection.
