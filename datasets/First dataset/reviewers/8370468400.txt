In the synchronization method, the output voltage and current of individual inverter are detected to calculate the equivalent reactive power. As the equivalent reactive power can reflect the phase information, so the inverter can adjust Its own phase to track the voltage of the output bus by controlling Its value of equivalent reactive power. The current-sharing method uses the AC signal on the output line to realize current-sharing control. The frequency of the small signal is inversely proportional to the output active power of the inverter. By comparing RMS of the local small signal with that of the overall signals added to the bus, the controller then regulate its own reference voltage to track the minimum output active power of the inverter in the system. An experiment system was built to verify the proposed method, and the results indicate the precise power balance performance for parallel operation.

34547562725	A new integrator for voltage model flux estimation in a digital dtc system	This paper presents a new solution, which can completely remove the DC offset and compensate the steady-state error for voltage model flux estimation in an induction motor (IM) direct torque control (DTC) system. The voltage model flux estimator has been paid more attention for its clear concept and simple signal processing, however, the integration drift associated with the inherent initial value error and DC offset input, especially in low speed region, can not be completely eliminated by the conventional low-pass-filter (LPF), in addition, LPF also brings steady-state amplitude and phase errors. Based on Bode plots analysis of some existing integrators, a new integrator with a first-order LPF and a high-pass-filter (HPF) in series is proposed to replace the pure integrator. The filters have adaptive cutoff frequency so as to suit various conditions. With the time phasor method, an error compensation formula is derived, which makes it simpler and easier for the new integrator to be applied to the digital control system. The new integrator with error compensation not only completely eliminates the integration drift, but also realizes errorless flux estimation in steady state. Both the simulation and experimental results on a prototype of 4kW IM DTC system show that the performance of the system especially in low speed region has been improved remarkably. This also verifies the effectiveness of the new integrator. © 2006 IEEE.

41549168706	A new torque control method for torque ripple minimization of BLDC motors with un-ideal back EMF	In classical control of brushless dc (BLDC) motors, flux distribution is assumed trapezoidal and fed current is controlled rectangular to obtain a desired constant torque. However, in reality, this assumption may not always be correct, due to nonuniformity of magnetic material and design trade-offs.

77951099352	Single current sensor operation with fixed sampling points using a common-mode voltage reduction PWM technique	A method is proposed for reconstructing AC currents with a single DC side current sensor in three-phase AC motor drive system. The method is based on a common-mode voltage (CMV) reduction PWM technique called LuPWM, which eliminates most of the invalid regions for current reconstruction both around zero voltage and near active-vectors. It realizes fixed-point sampling which is favorable for implementation. And the current prediction is also easier than traditional methods. Furthermore, it remains the good property of LuPWM that the peak-to-peak value of CMV, which leads to the premature deterioration of motor bearings, is reduced to 1/3 of the traditional three-phase PWM method in each sector. The additional computation load is minimal, and it can be widely applied. Experimental results are presented to fully support the above-mentioned claims. ©2009 IEEE.

78650146280	Single current sensor operation with fixed sampling points based on TSPWM	The single current sensor operation (SCSO) is favorable for cost reduction and fault-tolerance purposes in three-phase inverter-driven systems. This paper addresses a SCSO method based on tri-state pulse-width modulation technique (TSPWM). It enables fixed sampling points with minimal hardware and software requirements. Simultaneous three phase currents can be easily computed due to symmetrical sampling. No change to TSPWM is needed for most working points, thus it maintains advantages in common-mode voltage (CMV), switching loss and DC current ripple reduction. Based on the detailed analysis of non-ideal factor effects, regional modifications enlarge the feasible voltage region to almost the whole hexagon. It works well in close-loop systems and enables seamless transition in fault-tolerance operation for current sensor. Experimental results on a 4-kW induction motor drive are presented to verify the above-mentioned conclusions. © 2010 IEEE.

83355177324	Segment phase-shifted carrier PWM to reduce common-mode-voltage	In this paper, a segment phase-shifted carrier PWM method is proposed. According to the sector, the modulation wave can be discontinuous with different zero sequence signal injected and the carrier wave are phase shifted, which is different from conventional SVPWM. Using this technique, the peak-to-peak value of the common-mode voltage in one PWM cycle can be reduced to one third of the DC bus voltage at any speed, even despite of the dead-time effect. The good natural over modulation characteristic performance with high voltage utility is also researched. Furthermore, the technique can be generalized to obtain a series of PWM methods.

81855177163	An accurate rotor time constant estimation method for self-commissioning of multi-scale induction motor drives	This paper presents a novel strategy for accurate rotor time constant estimation while the induction motor keeps standstill. Based on the 'Γ' equivalent motor circuit model with all leakage located in the stator, the inertial first-order delay occurs in the mutual current relative to the stator current. Moreover, the delay time constant is only decided by the rotor time constant. Thus, an observer to estimate the mutual current by sample signal can be constructed. By changing the stator current at special moment according to the estimated mutual current, a significant transient response of stator voltage can be observed if estimated rotor time constant incorrect. Subsequently, a fast and robust close-loop null regulator is built to self-tune the rotor time constant. This method is completely independent of motor parameters and immune to the influence of dead time effect and voltage drop of semiconductor device. Experimental results on two different IMs are presented to prove the validity of the proposed method. © 2011 IEEE.

84866779333	A novel sensorless control method of IPMSM using dual PLL structure	Harmonics in back electromotive force (EMF) would greatly affect the accuracy of traditional sensorless control methods, and some of them may even fail. Phase locked loop (PLL) is a useful tool for phase detection in multiple-harmonic system, and is suitable for the control system of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (IPMSM) as it is often filled with harmonics when the motor is not carefully designed. In this paper, Dual-PLL structure is proposed to obtain the fundamental harmonic of the quantities of the motor, which are used in the speed and position estimation. The first PLL is the main path of the estimation and the phase of αβ-axes voltage is determined, while the second PLL focuses on speed estimation with low ripples. Extra measurement of the terminal voltage of the motor is not necessary and only the q-axis inductance is needed when the motor is run at i

84874528872	A novel initial rotor position estimation method for permanent magnet synchronous motors	When the permanent magnet synchronous (PMSM) is surface mounted and the magnetic saturation is not obvious, the inductances of dq-axes are almost the same, the traditional methods based on measuring the inductance cannot be used. In order to solve the problem, a novel initial rotor position estimation method based on rotor micro-movement is proposed. A rotating voltage vector is imposed on the stator, and the pulsating torque would be produced due to the generated rotating current vector. Rotor micro-movement would emerge with appropriate pulsating torque, and it will affect the current response. As the pulsating torque is concerned with the rotor position, the rotor position information would be contained in the current response. According to the model of the motor, the current responses under voltage vector with different frequencies are analyzed in this paper. Fourier analysis is used to calculate the current response, and the rotor position is obtained. Experiments are done on a built 1.25 kW PMSM platform, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. © 2013 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.

84875578820	Rotor time constant identification for a stationary induction motor	The mutual inductance and rotor resistance of an induction machine determines its rotor time constant. However, the mutual inductance is difficult to measure when the motor is not moving. Some estimation methods are based on the transient current response and optimization theory, but these are complicated and not accurate. This paper describes a direct method for measuring the rotor time constant using the 'inverse-Γ' equivalent motor circuit model to construct a closed-loop regulator for the rotor time constant due to the inertial first-order delay in the mutual current relative to the stator current. This delay time constant is uniquely related to the rotor time constant. Thus, the rotor time constant can be accurately measured by adjusting the estimated value of the rotor time constant to eliminate the transient response of the stator voltage, which was generated by giving an additional stator current into the motor. This regulator is fast and simple, completely independent of other motor parameters, and immune to the influence of the dead time effect of the inverter and the voltage drop in the semiconductor device. The validity is shown by experiments on two different induction motor drive systems. The results show that the rotor time constant can be quickly and accurately acquired by a simple program when the motor is not moving.

Based on the vector decomposition algorithm, the reference voltage vector was calculated on the fundamental subspace where the low order harmonics are eliminated. To realize smooth transitions from linear modulation to six-step operation, the proper switching state vectors were chosen according to superposition algorithm to recompose the reference voltage vector in over modulation section. The pulse width modulation (PWM) modulation strategy in full region was described in detail. The experimental results show that the amplitude of fundamental voltage is proportional to the modulation factor and the harmonics of stator currents are obviously reduced. © 2013 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.

84884769434	A three-phase current reconstruction technique using single DC current sensor based on TSPWM	Three-phase current reconstruction technique using dc current information in conventional two-level inverters can be used for the purpose of cost reduction and sensor fault tolerance. A novel phase current reconstruction scheme, with reduced immeasurable area and common mode voltage, is proposed in this paper. A tristate pulse-width modulation technique has been employed, in which three adjacent switching states are used to construct the reference voltage. The active switching states are arranged at the edge and the center of a PWM cycle. Fixed sampling and simultaneous three-phase currents can be easily achieved with very little hardware and software requirements. A detailed analysis of the effects of nonidealities leads to regional modifications of the switching sequence resulting in almost the whole hexagon as the feasible area. The usefulness of the proposed reconstruction algorithm has been verified by experimental results obtained from a 4-kW induction motor drive system. Smooth transitions between the redundant and fault-tolerant modes were observed. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

84883661966	Sensorless control of PMSM based on low frequency voltage injection at low speeds and standstill	Most sensorless control methods have problems when they are used in surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) that has little salient effect. To solve this problem, a novel low frequency voltage injection method is developed in this paper. Low frequency rotating voltage vectors are imposed on the stator, and the current responses are analyzed to get the rotor position information. Different from high frequency voltage injection, electric torque produced by low frequency voltage would has enough time to move the rotor a little but not big enough to rotate the rotor. The electric torque, friction torque and the cogging torque together will make the rotor oscillate around an equilibrium point. The back electromotive force produced by the rotor movement would have effect in the current response, which is finally used in the rotor position estimation. A rotor position estimation structure based on phase lock loop (PLL) is designed to continuously estimate the rotor position at low speeds and some offline experiments and compensation are added to get more accuracy estimation results. Experiments have been finished on a 1.25 kW PMSM at low speeds and standstill, the correctness of the proposed method has been demonstrated. © 2013 IEEE.

84890821659	Improved repetitive control for inverter current harmonics suppression	Repetitive control (RC) has been widely used for current harmonics suppression. However, RC is hard to use in variable frequency systems due to structural constraints with complex stability designs and large memory space. This paper presents an improved RC method using Fourier analyses and signal reconstruction at selected frequencies, which simplifies the stability design. The method requires almost no extra memory space and can be used in variable frequency systems without adjustment. The RC method is used to suppress current harmonics in a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) control system fed by an inverter. The current harmonics caused by the dead-time effects of the inverter and the non-sinusoidal shape of the back electromotive force of the PMSM are effectively suppressed. Tests on a 1.25 kW PMSM platform in the laboratory show that the amplitudes of the 6th and 12th current harmonics are decreased by 70%.

84894593177	A permanent magnet synchronous motor current suppression method based on resonant controllers	When permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is controlled by field oriented control method, dq-axes current will contain harmonics due to non-ideal factors including slot effect of the motor, dead-time effect of the inverter, etc. To suppress the current harmonics, the resonant controllers are used in this paper by adding to the current control loop. The gain of resonant controller at the given resonant frequency is infinite, so it can suppress the harmonic totally at this frequency, however, when the input happens to be a step signal, the overshoot will occur in the current response. To eliminate the overshoot, and also to improve the dynamic response of the current, a command feed-forward compensation method is used in this paper, meanwhile the effects of the digital control delay are considered. Current response without overshoot is achieved with fast current response. To demonstrate the method proposed in this paper, simulation study is done, experiments are also finished on a built 1.25 kW PMSM platform, the effectiveness of the proposed method including the suppression of current harmonics and the improvement of the dynamic response is verified. © 2014 Chin.
