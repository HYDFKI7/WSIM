13944278057	Dynamic performance of magneto-optical Bi-substituted rare-earth iron garnet	The dynamic performances of magneto-optical Bi-substituted rare-earth iron garnet (BIG) under different external magnetic fields and at different frequencies are experimentally studied. The measurement data indicate that the Faraday rotation angle is almost proportional to the external magnetic field when the garnet is far less saturated, while there is good switch performance when it is saturated. The higher the working frequency is, the larger the saturation magnetic field and the phase delay of Faraday angle relative to the field. The saturation fields and the phase delays at different frequencies are measured. The dynamic performance of the BIG determines the performance of BIG-based optical devices. To get the better performance of such devices, the garnets with small dampness and large stiffness should be chosen elaborately.

1442263973	Flat Broad-Band Wavelength Conversion Based on Sinusoidally Chirped Optical Superlattices in Lithium Niobate	We report the enhancement of the bandwidth and the response flatness of wavelength conversion through cascaded second-order nonlinear processes by sinusoidally chirped optical superlattices (SCOSs) in lithium niobate crystal. The conversion bandwidth of the SCOS is significantly larger than that of uniform and segmented gratings. The SCOS shows very flat conversion response in the 1.5-μm region. The physical origin of the bandwidth enhancement is ascribed to the plentiful reciprocal wave vectors of the SCOS, which provide enough momenta to simultaneously satisfy quasi-phase matching conditions for both second-harmonic generation and difference-frequency generation.

18944388638	Simple-structured all-order polarization mode dispersion emulator in DWDM systems	The PMD at a wide range of optical frequencies and statistics of all-order PMD, especially the first-, second- and third-order PMD, of a n-segment DGD units combination separated by PCs or PRs are fully analysed with Poincare sphere, Mueller matrix and Fourier transform methods. The results show that, to simulate all-order PMD in DWDM systems as truly as possible, the number of n should be as large as possible, the least value of 4 is preferred. The DGD units should be variable or unequal. Choosing PC or PR just affects the probability density function of PMD when n is not too much and the DGD values of the DGD units are unchangeable. At last, a simple, practical, and low cost all-order PMD emulator in DWDM systems is proposed.

When all crystal axes are aligned, the device can compensate for the first-order PMD. However, if all crystal axes are coupled with arbitrary angles, it can compensate for high-order PMD.

2942746513	Polarization-dependent coupling in twin-core photonic crystal fibers	The polarization dependence of light coupling in photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) with sixfold symmetric dual cores and highly birefringent dual cores are numerically investigated. The characteristics of PCF-based couplers, such as coupling length, extinction ratio and form birefringence, are examined as functions of the air-hole size and pitch. The silica bridges between air holes take an important role in the energy transfer across the two cores. We believe that the mechanism of light coupling in PCF-based couplers is different from that of conventional waveguide couplers. The polarization dependent coupling can be reduced by adjusting the air holes around the cores of PCFs. On the other hand, the polarization dependent coupling can be enhanced by introducing high birefringence in the two cores. © 2004 IEEE.

Different from conventional fiber-based polarization splitters, the birefringence in the new splitters results mainly from narrow silica regions physically connecting the two cores. This means that polarization splitting can be achieved without employing highly birefringent cores, which provides a possibility to greatly simplify the structures of the PCF-based polarization splitters and make them more practical. A 5-mm-long splitter with an extinction ratio of 20 dB has been obtained. We also discuss how the silica regions influence coupling characteristics of the dual-core PCFs and present a design guidance for the polarization splitters based on polarization-dependent coupling. © 2005 IEEE.

33645086124	Estimation the nonlinear impairment of single channel transmission systems with arbitrary parameters	A database is founded to estimate the nonlinear impairments of single channel return-to-zero (RZ) transmission systems with arbitrary parameters. Our link setup consists of multi-span transmission fiber and dispersion compensation component, with dispersion slope full compensating. The total transmission distance and the transmission fiber could be arbitrary, i.e. with arbitrary nonlinear coefficient, attenuation and dispersion. The parameters of input signal could also be arbitrary, i.e. with arbitrary transmission rate, input power, and any duty cycle of RZ pulse. Even the amplification schemes could be single-stage erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), or double-stage EDFA, or hybrid EDFA-Raman amplification. The database is obtained by numerous numerical simulations, neglecting the amplified spontaneous emission noise, polarization mode dispersion. The performance of transmission system impaired by nonlinear effects is represented by eye opening penalty (EOP). One can use the database to estimate the EOP of single channel transmission systems with bit rate up to 160 Gb/s, and can also evaluate the maximum transmission distance for given system impairment conveniently. For high-bit-rate transmission systems, intra-channel nonlinearity dominates the nonlinear impairments, therefore, the database to asses the nonlinear impairment of single channel transmission link is also valid for high-bit-rate wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) systems. The accuracy and the limitation of the database are also discussed.

33646935419	Analytical optimization of the net residual dispersion in SPM-limited dispersion-managed systems	Dispersion management is an effective technique to suppress the nonlinear impairment in fiber transmission systems, which includes tuning the amounts of precompensation, residual dispersion per span (RDPS), and net residual dispersion (NRD) of the systems. For self-phase modulation (SPM)-limited systems, optimizing the NRD is necessary because it can greatly improve the system performance. In this paper, an analytical method is presented to optimize NRD for SPM-limited dispersion-managed systems. The method is based on the correlation between the nonlinear impairment and the output pulse broadening of SPM-limited systems; therefore, dispersion-managed systems can be optimized through minimizing the output single-pulse broadening. A set of expressions is derived to calculate the output pulse broadening of the SPM-limited dispersion-managed system, from which the analytical result of optimal NRD is obtained. Furthermore, with the expressions of pulse broadening, how the nonlinear impairment depends on the amounts of precompensation and RDPS can be revealed conveniently. © 2006 IEEE.

We found that OPC cannot completely compensate for all Kerr nonlinearities in absence of power symmetry, and some nonlinearities may become even worse if one of the nonlinearities is fully compensated. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the compensation system to eliminate the most dominating nonlinearity. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the interplay of various kinds of nonlinearities. The need of proper design for transmission systems to suppress the dominating nonlinear effect is shown when all manifestations of Kerr nonlinearity are not compensated simultaneously. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33748472070	Bandwidth enhancement and response flattening of cascaded sum- and difference-frequency generation-based wavelength conversion	We investigate bandwidth enhancement and response flattening of wavelength conversion based on cascaded sum-frequency generation and difference-frequency generation (SFG/DFG) in quasi-phase-matched periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides by use of two pump lights. Analysis shows that the conversion properties deeply depend on the pump settings. The bandwidth is efficiently enhanced by augmenting the pump wavelength difference. The critical bandwidth corresponding to the response fluctuation of 1 dB in a 3-cm-long waveguide reaches 80-90 nm, which is enough to cover the entire conventional-band and long-wavelength-band. The cascaded SFG/DFG bandwidth is about 24% broader than that of the cascaded second-harmonic generation and difference-frequency generation-based configuration with the same waveguide length. However, the response fluctuation is also enhanced together with the bandwidth enhancement. The method of pump detuning is presented to flatten the response fluctuation. The fluctuation is reduced by more than 1 dB and it can be further reduced by increasing the pump detuning value with a little efficiency penalty. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

34247092101	Performance evaluation of tunable channel-selective wavelength shift by cascaded sum- and difference-frequency generation in periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides	We theoretically evaluate the performance of tunable channel-selective wavelength shift based on cascaded sum- and difference-frequency generation by the use of two pump lights in periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides. In double-pass configurations, the functions of wavelength add/drop and wavelength shift are easy to integrate in the same waveguide. Analysis shows that a longer waveguide more competently adapts narrower channel spacing in wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) systems. This wavelength shifter is flexible due to the almost separable operations of the two pumps: The channel is selected by setting the first pump, and the wavelength-shifting value is tuned by adjusting the second pump. This wavelength shifter has a very large dynamic region. For a 2.56-cm-long waveguide, the maximum dynamic region is as broad as 67 nm in a 0.4-nm channel-spacing WDM system. The dynamic region is mainly dominated by the limitation of multiple-channel crosstalk in a dense WDM system. However, it is dominated by the limitation of single-channel efficiency fluctuation in a coarse one. © 2007 IEEE.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to optimize the NRD for SPM-impaired systems. We find that in SPM-impaired system, the optimal NRD can be obtained by minimizing the output distortion of a single pulse. Using a perturbation theory, a semianalytical expression is derived to calculate the output distortion of a single pulse. With the obtained expression, the NRD of SPM-impaired dispersion-managed systems can be optimized conveniently. Compared to previous methods, the present method is simple and fast. The validity of this method is verified by numerical simulations for various SPM-impaired systems. © 2007 IEEE.

The excitation light is coupled into the fiber core from one end (measuring-tip) while the sample entrance is at the other end (probing-tip) of the fiber. The SERS signal scattered by the sample propagates through the fiber core back to the measuring-tip; then is coupled out of the fiber into the Raman spectrometer. The advantages of such probes include, the confinement of light inside the HCPCF provides a higher light efficiency; and the nanoparticles coated inside the air holes offers a larger interaction area for SERS. Both experimental results and theoretical analysis are presented and discussed.

We investigated the impact of PMD-PDL interaction on degree of polarization (DOP), which is the most commonly used feedback signal in PMD compensation. The simulation results of a 40-Gb/s NRZ code optical transmission system show that the maximum PMD increases from approximately 40 ps to more than 45 ps, while minimum DOP declines from approximately 0.6 to approximately 0.2. The interaction of PMD and PDL also induces residual PMD underestimation of 5-8 ps, which causes degradation of PMD compensation performance.

However, for practical systems without power-symmetry, it is found that the effects of OPC on various nonlinearities are different in the same link. Even some nonlinearities are suppressed and some are enhanced. Therefore, optimizing the transmission link with OPC to suppress the dominant nonlinearity is demanded. By using 1 -km-long highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) and tuning the pump wavelength near the zero dispersion wavelength of the HNLF, we experimentally generate the phase conjugation of the dispersed ∼300 fs pulses.

A set of analytical expressions for the amplitude and phase of the output pulses is derived. Analytical analysis shows that the generated idler pulse is far away from the phase conjugation of the input signal, and that the output signal is not an amplified replica of the input signal. These phenomena are due to both the phase distortion caused by self- and cross-phase modulation and the temporal envelope broadening resulting from pump depletion. Besides, in the frequency domain, the spectral inversion between signal/idler will be destroyed. The implications of the phase and shape distortions in all-optical signal processing by FWM are discussed.

Analyte solution mixed with the silver nanoparticles enters each core via the capillary effect, and the silver nanoparticles serve as the SERS substrate. The excitation light transmitting in each hollow core can interact directly with the analyte and the silver nanoparticles in the air cores along the fiber axis. The SERS signal scattered by the sample propagates through the fiber back to the measuring-tip; then couples out of the fiber into the Raman spectrometer. Comparing to a single core PCF SERS probe, the multi-core probe not only takes the advantages of high efficiency of light usage and large interaction space for SERS in each channel, but also is more robust and could provide multi-data. Basing on the seven data of the analyte from the seven channels, an accurate average result could be achieved with less instability. Different concentration Rhodamine 6G solutions have been used as test samples, and the multi-channel sensing idea has been demonstrated by the proof-of-concept experiments. © 2009 SPIE.

69949138930	Ultrafast depolarizer based on four-wave mixing in highly nonlinear optical fiber	We present an ultrafast depolarizer based on four-wave mixing (FWM) in highly nonlinear optical fiber (HNLF), in which a completely polarized laser beam with any fixed state of polarization (SOP) mixed with an unpolarized pump can be instantaneously converted into an unpolarized idler wave. The degree-of-polarization (DOP) of the idler wave is experimentally measured to be 0.33 when the DOPs of the polarized signal and unpolarized pump are 0.986 and 0.036, respectively. We analyze the beam couplings between a polarized beam and a completely unpolarized pump in the ultrafast depolarizer by using vector FWM theory. The nonzero DOP of the idler wave ascribes to the polarization dependence of the FWM conversion efficiency. The speed of the depolarizer is determined by the intrinsic nonlinear response of silica, which could be just a few femtoseconds. © 2009 SPIE.

70349599523	Four-wave mixing between coherent signal and incoherent pump light in nonlinear fiber	We report an experimental and theoretical investigation of the four-wave mixing (FWM) process between a coherent signal light and an incoherent pump light in a highly nonlinear fiber. In the experiment, two main phenomena are observed: 1) the peak power of the spectrum of the coherent signal light decreases along the fiber rather than be amplified; 2) the spectrum of the coherent signal is broadened. A theory of the FWM process between incoherent pump and coherent signal is proposed by considering the incoherence of the pump which has amplitude and phase fluctuations.

We prove that in the four-wave mixing process, the signal and idler waves would finally propagate in a common group velocity in spite of their different group indices. When the effective phase mismatch in four-wave mixing is not zero, their carrier frequencies shift in different directions. The asymptotic result of the signal and idler shape and carrier frequency shift are obtained. The theoretical prediction is validated by the numerical simulation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

75349086143	Dynamics of relaxation oscillation caused by stimulated Brillouin scattering in optical fiber and its suppression	In order to further study the dynamics of relaxation oscillation during stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and to avoid optical damage caused by SBS under high power lasers in applications such as fiber amplifier and fiber phase conjugate mirror, etc., the dynamics of relaxation oscillation during SBS in fibers are studied on the basis of the SBS coupled amplitude equations using numerical simulations of finite difference methods. Meanwhile, we propose a method to suppress the relaxation oscillation. For different rise time of SBS pump pulse, the temporal and spatial variation of intensities of pump and Stokes waves is plotted as three-dimensional figures. The corresponding experiments have been conducted and the experimental results agree well with the theoretical results. From the experiments and numerical calculations it can be concluded that, by increasing the rise time of SBS pump pulse the relaxation oscillation can be suppressed effectively and the optical damage caused by SBS can be avoided consequently. © 2009 Chin.Phys.Soc.

Formulas for output phase and power are derived. It is found that, for a single-pulse signal input, the SPM/XPM of the signal will cause frequency chirping to the output; for a pulse-sequence, the amplitude-fluctuation of the input signal will destroy the phase regeneration through the SPM/XPM. In addition, the amplified signal pulse will initially be compressed and distorted, and then it will get broadened due to pump-depletion. © 2009 IEEE.

Depending on output coupling ratios, the polarization states of the pulse peak before the polarizer can be either nearly circular or nearly linear polarizations. The polarization dependent component in NPR is found to play a role of spectral filter under high and medium output coupling. However, NPR may work as a weak optical limiter under low output coupling, when additional spectral filtering is necessary to maintain steady mode-locking state. © 2011 Optical Society of America.

The influences of pump power, gain fiber length, and cavity length (i.e., repetition rate) on the mode-locking wavelength and output spectrum are investigated. It is found that the tunable range of mode-locking wavelength depends on the length of the Yb-doped fiber, as well as the cavity loss, and is independent of the cavity length. Mode-locking in a longer wavelength regime can be obtained by increasing the gain fiber length, although the length depends on the cavity loss. Moreover, the effects of pump power, central wavelength, Yb-doped fiber length, and cavity length on other output parameters are discussed. The variation range of pump power to keep the mode-locking status is also analyzed. We find that the pump power range for keeping the mode-locking status decreases, and the typical output pulsewidth increases dramatically as the repetition rate decreases. Guidelines for designingANDi Yb-doped mode-locked fiber lasers are proposed. © 2009-2012 IEEE.

84916625074	Mode-pulling and phase-matching in broadband Kerr frequency comb generation	We present a quantitative analysis of Kerr effect induced cavity resonance pulling and phase-matching in broadband Kerr frequency comb generation based on the Lugiato-Lefever equation. Unevenly spaced cavity modes are pulled to be evenly spaced by the Kerr effect when cavity solitons are formed. Phase-matching in the cascaded four-wave mixing is achieved simultaneously, giving the cavity solitons strong stability. The number of modes that can be pulled into alignment in the cavity soliton regime depends on the pump condition and decreases exponentially with linearly increasing anomalous dispersion. However, in the chaotic modulation instability and breather soliton regimes, well-aligned cavity modes and phase-matching are not achieved. Compared to intracavity pulse dynamics, the mode-pulling effect and phase-matching are less sensitive to high-order dispersion as long as the cavity solitons stay stable.

0347589515	Comparison of interchannel four-wave mixing with continuous waves, quasi-continuous waves and ultrashort pulses	We compare the interchannel four-wave mixing (FWM) in dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) systems with continuous waves, quasi-continuous waves and ultrashort pulses. The differences are theoretically analyzed for the three inputs. We investigate the FWM conversion efficiency as a function of the channel spacing, the fiber length, the single bit energy and the pulse width. It is shown that the FWM effect in DWDM systems with quasi-continuous waves is the strongest and with ultrashort pulses is the lowest among the three cases. The FWM conversion efficiency changes periodically with the propagation length, and it is approximately an exponential function of the single bit energy. The performance of the pulse FWM effect versus the pulse width is different from that of the quasi-continuous wave FWM, which may be one possible way to suppress the interchannel FWM.

12844257534	Analysis of ultrashort-pulse second-harmonic generation in both phase- and group-velocity-matched structures	Second-harmonic generation (SHG) of ultrashort pulse in both phase- and group-velocity mismatch structures is studied theoretically in temporal and frequency domains taking account of the effects of group-velocity dispersion (GVD) and high-order phase mismatch. Under the plane-wave and pump undepletion approximation, a set of simple analytical expressions is derived in frequency domain for Gaussian pulse. Furthermore, a formula describing the SH pulse is obtained under pump depletion condition. The obtained expressions are valid in large range of interaction length and have features such as explicit form, high accuracy, and less computing time. Meanwhile, the influences of intensity, pulse duration, chirp coefficient and shape of pump pulses, as well as the linear loss of material, on the pulsewidth preservation length are investigated by numerical method. In the case of both phase- and group-velocity mismatch structures, the conversion efficiency larger than 45% could be obtained without pulse distortion for weak input ultrashort pulse. © 2005 IEEE.

13144275275	Compact optical roll-angle sensor with large measurement range and high sensitivity	A simple and effective optical roll-angle sensor based on a magnetic garnet single crystal is demonstrated. The measurement is based on the principle that, when linearly polarized light whose polarization varies alternately in two orthogonal directions passes through a polarization analyzer, the transmitted optical intensity varies. The output voltage from an optical detector located after the analyzer can be used to determine the roll angle. The chief advantages of the sensor are that it is compact, flexible, low cost, and power effective and provides a fast response. Most importantly, the sensor is insensitive to various fluctuations such as optical intensity, photodiode responsivity, and temperature and to vibrations. This performance is most advantageous in long-distance or long-term measurements. Experimental results have shown that the angular resolution is 0.01° in a ±30° range. © 2005 Optical Society of America.

1242264499	Broadband and multiple-channel visible laser generation by use of segmented quasi-phase-matching gratings	We investigate frequency conversion of near-infrared laser sources to generate visible laser outputs with segmented quasi-phase-matching (QPM) gratings through second-harmonic generation process. Analysis shows that segmented gratings have much broader conversion bandwidth and environment temperature tolerance than periodic gratings, which is extremely beneficial for reducing the difficulties of QPM for both laser sources and temperature-controlled devices. By use of a near-infrared broadband laser source, segmented gratings provide potential to realize multichannel visible laser sources that have many applications in, such as, high-density optical storage and high-definition television. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.
