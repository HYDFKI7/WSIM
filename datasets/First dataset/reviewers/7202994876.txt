17844363276	Magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging in the diagnosis of diffuse liver diseases in rats	Background: The diagnosis of diffuse hepatic lesions in early stage is a tough task at any time for clinical conventional imaging. Magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (MR DWI) can detect the changes of tissue structure at molecular level. This study was designed to determine the value of DWI in the diagnosis of diffuse liver lesions in early stage. Methods: Diffuse liver lesions were induced by diethylnitrosamine in 42 rats of test group. Fourteen rats in control group were fed with pure water. Dynamic changes of MR DWI were observed every week in both groups during the early stage of diffuse liver lesions (1 to 12 weeks after drug administration in the test group). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of liver parenchyma in different stages and pathologic changes were analyzed. Results: The process of diffuse hepatic lesions in the test group was classified into three stages according to pathological changes, namely hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. No obvious morphological changes were shown by conventional imaging in both groups during this stage. But MR DWI demonstrated heterogeneous signal changes in early stage of hepatic cirrhosis in the test group. No significant change of ADC values was found in the control group between different weeks (P > 0.05). The ADC values of the test group declined from the fifth week, and after the tenth week the ADC values were significantly different between the test and control groups at gradient factor (b) value 300 sec/mm

20344388558	X-ray diffraction-enhanced imaging of uterine leiomyomas	Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the microstructures of a uterine leiomyoma using a synchrotron-based imaging technique. Material/Methods: The tissues of different regions of a uterine leiomyoma were imaged using X-ray diffraction-enhanced imaging. Results: Compared with optical microscopy and conventional X-ray, X-ray diffraction-enhanced imaging can show not only the surface, but also the internal structure of organs or soft tissues with better contrast. Internal hyaline degeneration and the cavum of liquefied uterine leiomyomas are shown very clearly. Some microstructures, such as the myomatous burble, rupture and conglomeration of muscle fiber, and the cavum resulting from red degeneration, can be displayed in X-ray diffraction-enhanced images. These microstructures can show the developmental progress of necrosis in uterine leiomyomas and indicate their potential canceration. Conclusions: X-ray diffraction-enhanced imaging can clearly show internal microstructures of uterine leiomyomas, making the complex procedure of doing this with a large number of pathology slices avoidable. © Med Sci Monit, 2005.

21044434768	CT perfusion at early stage of hepatic diffuse disease	Aim: To determine the validity of the non-invasive method of CT perfusion (CTP) in rat model of hepatic diffuse disease. Methods: Twenty-eight Wistar rats were divided into two groups. Liver diffuse lesions were induced by diethylnitrosamine in 14 rats of test group. Rats in control group were bred with pure water. From the 1st to 12th wk after the test group was intervened, both groups were studied every week with CTP. CTP parameters of liver parenchyma in different periods and pathologic changes in two groups were compared and analyzed. Results: The process of hepatic diffuse lesions in test groups was classified into three stages or periods according to the pathologic alterations, namely hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, and cirrhosis. During this period, hepatic artery flow (HAF) of control group declined slightly, mean transit time (MTT), blood flow (BF) and volume (BV) increased, but there were no significant differences between different periods. In test group, HAF tended to increase gradually, MTT prolonged obviously, BV and BF decreased at the same time. The results of statistical analysis revealed that the difference in the HAF ratio of test group to control group was significant. The ratio of BV and BF in test group to control group in stage of hepatitis and hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic fibrosis and early stage of hepatic cirrhosis was significantly different, but there was no significant difference between hepatitis and hepatic fibrosis. The main pathological changes in stage of hepatitis were swelling of hepatic cells, while sinusoid capillarization and deposition of collagen aggravated gradually in the extravascular Disse's spaces in stage of fibrosis and early stage of cirrhosis. Conclusion: The technique could reflect some early changes of hepatic blood perfusion in rat with liver diffuse disease and is valuable for their early diagnosis. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

30044447660	Diffraction enhanced imaging of breast tissue	For evaluating the X-ray diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI) technology in the early diagnosis of breast cancer, the massive samples of normal breast tissue and cancerous one were imaged by DEI method using hard X-rays from 4W1A beamline at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). DEI images of both normal and cancerous breast tissues have been comparatively analyzed. The results show that diffraction images obtained at the top position of the rocking curve is clear enough and approximately display the structures of the soft tissue. The apparent absorption image is basically similar to the conventional mammography, and there are definite difficulties in distinguishing variant soft-tissues and its ability of finding cancerous soft-tissues is lower than the diffraction image. The inner structures of samples and the differences in shape, size, distribution and structure of the gland for normal and cancerous breast tissues can be clearly shown in refraction images. So, the DEI technology has high value in diagnosing breast cancer and may be an important complementary to early diagnostic method.

33645992787	Diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery MRI for intracranial tumors in comparison with post-contrast T1W spin-echo MRI	Background: Contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAI R) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been reported to have higher sensitivity for detecting leptomeningeal disease compared with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI CE T1WI). However, currently there are no studies showing the potential value of clinical applications of contrast-enhanced FLAIR (CE FLAIR) sequence in diagnosing intracranial tumors in a larger group of patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of CE FLAIR in comparison with CE T1WI for intracranial tumors and to provide more information for clinical diagnosis and therapy. Methods: One hundred and four consecutive cases of intracranial tumors referred for CE brain MRI were analyzed with regard to FLAIR and T1WI pre- and post-administration of Gd-DTPA. The CE FLAIR and CE T1WI were evaluated independently by two radiologists for the number of examinations with one or more enhanced lesions, the number and location of enhanced lesions per examination, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-enhancement ratio (CER) of lesions, as well as the size and extent of the enhanced lesions. Results: In 98 of 104 cases, enhanced lesions were seen both on the FLAIR and T1W images. More lesions were seen on CE T1WI (n=120) than those on CE FLAIR sequence (n=117), but no differences of statistical significance were found between the two sequences (P>0.05). Four lesions were revealed only on the CE FLAIR images whereas 7 lesions were only found on CE T1WI. Enhanced lesions located in the cerebral hemisphere or the forth ventricle were revealed much more on CE T1WI than on CE FLAIR images. However, CE FLAIR images may be useful in showing superficial abnormalities and those located in the sulcus or lateral ventricle. The CER and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) on CE T1WI was significantly higher (t=7.10, P=0.00; t=9.67, P=0.00, respectively), but grey matter/ white matter contrast was lower (t=2.46, P=0.02) than those on CE FLAIR images. The SNR did not show any statistically significant difference between the two sequences (t=1.1,P=0.27). The size and extent of lesions on the CE FLAIR images were significantly larger than those on CE T1WI (t=4.13, P=0.00) Conclusions: CE FLAIR and CE T1WI may complement each other in showing intracranial tumors and the CE FLAIR sequence should be selected as a routine MRI sequence.

33947714250	MR imaging evaluation of ductal carcinoma in situ and ductal carcinoma in situ with small invasive foci of breast	Objective: To retrospectively assess diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in preoperative assessment of local extent of breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and DCIS with small invasive foci, compared with the mammography and ultrasonography (US) imagings. Methods: Results of MRI, mammography, and US imaging from 17 consecutive women with known breast DCIS and DCIS with invasive foci were analyzed, and then compared with pathologic examination. Results: (1) Fourteen lesions showed enhancement on dynamic breast MRI, of which 11 lesions were no-mass-like enhancement. Six of 11 lesions appeared segmental enhancement, and 2 were regional enhancement. Ductal and multiple focal areas enhancement were 1 case respectively. Symmetric diffuse enhancement in bilateral breast was showed in 1 patient. Ductal dilation was visible in ipsilateral breast on pre-contrast MRI in 2 cases, which manifested bloody nipple discharge in clinical examination, and duct enhanced on post-contrast imaging in one of them. Two lesions appeared mass enhancement with irregular shape and homogeneous signal. Linear enhancement surrounding the oval homogeneous mass with smooth margin found in 1 case. (2) Thirteen of 17 patients underwent bilateral mammography. There were various findings in mammograms, including microcalcifcations (6 cases), normal mammograms (2 cases), calcifications with other appearance (2 cases), and non-calcification abnormity (3 cases). In 8 lesions with calcifications, 5 were noted higher probability of malignancy calcifications and 3 intermediate concern calcifications. Calcifications distributed clustered (5 cases), regional (2 cases) and diffuse (1 case) shape. (3) Sixteen of 17 patients were performed breast US examination. Eleven lesions, which were correct diagnosed, appeared higher echo spots within irregular lower echo area. One lesion diagnosed benign and 4 were negative on US examination. (4) Regarded the size measured on pathologic examination as golden standard, accordance of lesion extent was 13 of 17 case in MRI, 7 of 13 in mammography, and 7 of 16 in US. There were 2 lesions overestimation of extent in MRI, 3 in mammography, and 2 in US. Underestimation of extent showed 1 case and 3 cases in mammography and US imaging respectively. The difference was not significant (P = 0.161). Conclusion: The MR imaging features of DCIS and DCIS with small invasive foci were characteristic. The combination of MRI and mammography could improve diagnostic accuracy.

34247141077	Assessment of hemodynamics in precancerous lesion of hepatocellular carcinoma: Evaluation with MR perfusion	Aim: To investigate the hemodynamic changes in a precancerous lesion model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Hemodynamic changes in 18 Wistar rats were studied with non-invasive magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion. The changes induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) developed into liver nodular lesions due to hepatic cirrhosis during the progression of carcinogenesis. The MR perfusion data [positive enhancement integral (PEI)] were compared between the nodular lesions corresponding well with MR images and pathology and their surrounding hepatic parenchyma. Results: A total of 46 nodules were located by MR imaging and autopsy, including 22 dysplastic nodules (DN), 9 regenerative nodules (RN), 10 early HCCs and 5 overt HCCs. Among the 22 DNs, 6 were low-grade DN (LGDN) and 16 were high-grade DN (HGDN). The average PEI of RN, DN, early and overt HCC was 205.67 ± 31.17, 161.94 ± 20.74, 226.09 ± 34.83, 491.86 ± 44.61 respectively, and their liver parenchyma nearby was 204.84 ± 70.19. Comparison of the blood perfusion index between each RN and its surrounding hepatic parenchyma showed no statistically significant difference (P = 0.06). There were significant differences in DN (P = 0.02). During the late hepatic arterial phase, the perfusion curve in DN declined. DN had an iso-signal intensity at the early hepatic arterial phase and a low signal intensity at the portal venous phase. Of the 10 early HCCs, 4 demonstrated less blood perfusion and 6 displayed minimally increased blood flow compared to the surrounding parenchyma. Five HCCs showed significantly increased blood supply compared to the surrounding parenchyma (P = 0.02). Conclusion: Non-invasive MR perfusion can detect changes in blood supply of precancerous lesions. © 2007 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

35248883809	Colorectal neoplasm: Magnetic resonance colonography with fat enema-initial clinical experience	Aim: To assess Magnetic resonance colonography with fat enema as a method for detection of colorectal neoplasm. Methods: Consecutive twenty-two patients underwent MR colonography with fat enema before colonoscopy. T1-weighted three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo with inversion recovery sequence was acquired with the patient in the supine position before and 75 s after Gadopentetate Dimelumine administration. Where by, pre and post MR coronal images were obtained with a single breath hold for about 20 s to cover the entire colon. The quality of MR colonographs and patients' tolerance to fat contrast medium was investigated. Colorectal neoplasms identified by MR colonography were compared with those identified on colonoscopy and sensitivity of detecting the lesions was calculated accordingly. Results: MR colonography with fat enema was well tolerated without sedation and analgesia. 120 out of 132 (90.9%) colonic segments were well distended and only 1 (0.8%) colonic segment was poor distension. After contrast enhancement scan, mean contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) value between the normal colonic wall and lumen was 18.5 ± 2.9 while mean CNR value between colorectal neoplasm and lumen was 20.2 ± 3.1. By Magnetic resonance colonography, 26 of 35 neoplasms (sensitivity 74.3%) were detected. However, sensitivity of MRC was 95.5% (21 of 22) for neoplasm larger than 10 mm and 55.6% (5 of 9) for 5-10 mm neoplasm. Conclusion: MR colonography with fat enema and T1-weighted three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo with inversion recovery sequence is feasible in detecting colorectal neoplasm larger than 10 mm. © 2007 WJG.

79952339828	Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Intraindividual Crossover Comparison of Gadobenate Dimeglumine and Gadopentetate Dimeglumine for Breast MR Imaging (DETECT Trial)	Purpose: To intraindividually compare 0.1 mmol/kg doses of gadobenate dimeglumine and gadopentetate dimeglumine for contrast material-enhanced breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging by using a prospective, multicenter double-blind, randomized protocol. Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval and patient informed consent were obtained. One hundred sixty-two women (mean age, 52.8 years ± 12.3 [standard deviation]) enrolled at 17 sites in Europe and China between July 2007 and May 2009 underwent at least one breast MR imaging examination at 1.5 T by using three-dimensional spoiled gradient-echo sequences. Of these, 151 women received both contrast agents in randomized order in otherwise identical examinations separated by more than 2 but less than 7 days. Images, acquired at 2-minute or shorter intervals after contrast agent injection, were evaluated independently by three blinded radiologists unaffiliated with enrollment centers. Histopathologic confirmation was available for all malignant lesions (n = 144), while benign lesions were confirmed either by using histopathologic examination (n = 52) or by at least 12-month diagnostic follow-up (n = 20) with mammography and/or ultrasonography. Determinations of malignant lesion detection rates and diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value [PPV], and negative predictive value [NPV]) were performed and compared (McNemar and Wald tests). A full safety assessment was performed. Results: Significant superiority for gadobenate dimeglumine was noted by readers 1, 2, and 3 for malignant lesion detection rate (91.7%, 93.1%, 94.4% vs 79.9%, 80.6%, 83.3%, respectively; P ≤ .0003). Readers 1, 2, and 3 reported significantly superior diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy) for breast cancer detection with gadobenate dimeglumine (91.1%, 94.5%, 95.2% vs 81.2%, 82.6%, 84.6%; 99.0%, 98.2%, 96.9% vs 97.8%, 96.9%, 93.8%; 98.2%, 97.8%, 96.7% vs 96.1%, 95.4%, 92.8%, respectively; P ≤ .0094) and significantly superior PPV (91.1%, 85.2%, 77.2% vs 80.7%, 75.5%, 60.9%, respectively; P ≤ .0002) and NPV (99.0%, 99.4%, 99.4% vs 97.8%, 98.0%, 98.1%, respectively; P ≤ .0003). No safety concerns were noted with either agent. Conclusion: Gadobenate dimeglumine is superior to gadopentetate dimeglumine for breast cancer diagnosis. © RSNA, 2010.

84887266407	MRI-guided breast lesion localization and lesion analysis	Objective: To analyze the indications, techniques of MR-guided localization and the imaging features of breast lesion. Methods: Hook wire localization was performed in 43 patients whose lesions were only detected by MRI, based on a 1.5 T MR scanner and a special MR biopsy positioning frame. The feasibility of operation and accuracy of localization were explored. Lesion features and pathologic findings were analyzed using Fisher exact test. Results: A total of 37 patients (86.0%) with 38 lesions underwent MR-guided localization. Of the 6 patients canceled, the lesions were not obvious in 4 patients, and the positioning was difficult in 2 cases. Of the 38 lesions, 17 were masses, 20 were non-mass enhancement lesions, and one lesion was undetermined enhancement. There were 11 (28.9%) malignant lesions. The distribution of internal enhancement pattern was different between benign and malignant non-mass lesions (P=0.028), while the other morphological features between benign and malignant were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Conclusions: MR-guided localization provides an accurate and safe method for localizing the suspicious lesions on MRI. The morphological findings of these lesions are not characteristic for the differentiation of benign and malignant lesions. Copyright © 2013 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84887279832	Radiological features of mastitis	Objective: To describe the radiological features of mastitis. Methods: Imaging findings were retrospectively reviewed in 58 women with mastitis, which was confirmed by pathological results. The imaging features were described according to the BI-RADS (breast imaging reporting and data system). All 58 patients had preoperative MRI, while 49 of them were examined with sonograms and 30 with mammograms preoperatively. Results: Overall, no remarkable findings were reported on 6 mammography and 2 sonography examinations, but all 58 lesions were identified on MRI in our study. Asymmetrical density (n=16, 53.3%) on mammograms and solitary or multiple separated/contiguous hypoechoic mass-like lesions (n=34, 69.4%) on ultrasound were the most common signs of mastitis. On enhanced MR images, 82.8% (48/58) patients showed non-mass-like enhanced lesions. Multiple, regional enhancement (66.7%, 32/48) and separated or contiguous, clumped, rim-like enhancement (63.1%, 31/48) were the most common manifestations in non-mass-like enhanced lesions. Of the 58 patients, type I and type II time-signal intensity curve were detected in 48.3% and 50.0% of the patients, respectively. BI-RADS 0 had the highest frequency in reports on mammography (33.3%, 10/30), while category 4a was most frequent on sonography (36.7%, 18/49) and also on MRI (56.9%, 33/58). Conclusion: The imaging findings from mammography and US are non-specific for mastitis, therefore, MR can be helpful in the diagnosis, especially in the presence of non-mass-like enhancement that are multiple, regional, separated, or contiguous, clumped, and rim-like.

84925453520	A new approach for extracting phase effect based on in-line X-ray phase imaging	In clinical applications, the X-ray spectra from tungsten are continuous, and include both attenuation and phase effects for in-line X-ray imaging. A new approach for extracting the pure phase effect from the mixed images is presented. In this work, a normalized imaging formula independent of the light intensity is derived for the polychromatic case. Taking both photoelectric and Compton interactions into account, the attenuation effects at 70 and 50 kVp for borosilicate pyrex, air, and water are accurately calculated and shown to be stable across these substances. The attenuation effect at the interface can be greatly weakened by the subtraction of the attenuation effects of two normalized images, thus revealing details of the phase effect. The experimental results show that this approach is valid.

44049096119	Imaging findings of Castleman disease of the abdomen and pelvis	Background: The purpose of this study was to analyze the characteristic features of Castleman disease in the abdomen and pelvis as suggested by imaging findings in order to deepen the recognition and understanding of this rare disease. Methods: A group of ten patients with pathologically proven Castleman disease in the abdomen (n = 9) and pelvis (n = 1) were included in this study. Patients were 18∼56-year-old (mean = 40); seven of them were men and three were women. Imaging findings (CT&MRI, n = 4; only CT, n = 4; only MRI, n = 2) were retrospectively reviewed and correlated with clinical and pathologic findings. Results: The lesions were divided into those with localized Castleman (n = 9) and disseminated Castleman (n = 1). The pathologic subtype of all nine cases of localized disease was hyaline vascular with six patients showing a solitary mass and three having a single dominant mass surrounded by small satellite nodules. On nonenhanced CT images, the lesions were manifested as homogeneous masses of soft tissue attenuation, which was isoattenuated relative to normal muscle. On MRI, the lesions were isointense or slightly hypointense compared with that of normal muscle on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. After intravenous injection of contrast media, most of the masses (7/9) showed marked enhancement and slow washout with the degree of enhancement approaching that of the large arteries. And in the interior of four cases of larger masses (>5 cm) was observed fissured and radial patterns in both low-density area on CT and low-signal area on MRI. These patterns were pathologically proved to be fibrous. The pathological subtype of a sole disseminated case was plasma-cell type, where imaging findings showed a lining of well defined, sharply enhanced soft-tissue nodules in retroperitoneal zone. Conclusion: Imaging findings of Castleman disease in the abdomen and pelvis are closely related to pathological type diagnosed. The characteristic features of localized and hyaline vascular type of Castleman disease include a solitary mass or a dominant mass surrounded with small satellite nodules, and high enhancement and slow washout with the degree of enhancement approaches that of large arteries. The presence of central areas of fibrosis of the larger tumors is one of the characteristic features of this disease. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Methods: CT-guided transthoracic aspiration biopsy was performed in 116 patients with intrapulmonary parenchymal occupied lesions from June 2006 to June 2007 in our hospital. The complications and the whole process of puncture were analyzed to obtain the experience for reducing the occurrence of complications. Results: CT-guided transthoracic aspiration biopsy was succeeded in all 116 cases. The major complications included pneumothorax (15.51%), puncture tract hemorrhage (10.34%), hemoptysis (4.31%)and others (1.72%). Only l case of pneumothorax was treated by closed thoracic drainage and no specific treatment for others. Conclusion: CT-guided transthoracic aspiration biopsy for pulmonary lesions is an efficient and safe diagnostic modality. The criteria for reducing the complications are associated with accurate localization, the correct breath training and evaluation of lesion before the operation.

44949098558	Comprehensive evaluation of an image segmentation technique for measuring tumor volume from CT images	Comprehensive quantitative evaluation of tumor segmentation technique on large scale clinical data sets is crucial for routine clinical use of CT based tumor volumetry for cancer diagnosis and treatment response evaluation. In this paper, we present a systematic validation study of a semi-automatic image segmentation technique for measuring tumor volume from CT images. The segmentation algorithm was tested using clinical data of 200 tumors in 107 patients with liver, lung, lymphoma and other types of cancer. The performance was evaluated using both accuracy and reproducibility. The accuracy was assessed using 7 commonly used metrics that can provide complementary information regarding the quality of the segmentation results. The reproducibility was measured by the variation of the volume measurements from 10 independent segmentations. The effect of disease type, lesion size and slice thickness of image data on the accuracy measures were also analyzed. Our results demonstrate that the tumor segmentation algorithm showed good correlation with ground truth for all four lesion types (r = 0.97,0.99,0.97,0.98, p < 0.0001 for liver, lung, lymphoma and other respectively). The segmentation algorithm can produce relatively reproducible volume measurements on all lesion types (coefficient of variation in the range of 10 - 20%). Our results show that the algorithm is insensitive to lesion size (coefficient of determination close to 0) and slice thickness of image data(p > 0.90). The validation framework used in this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new tumor segmentation algorithms and assist large scale evaluation of segmentation techniques for other clinical applications.

63449116603	Effect of b value on monitoring therapeutic response by diffusion-weighted imaging	Aim: To explore the diffusion gradient b-factor that optimizes both apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurement and contrast-to-noise (CNR) for assessing tumor response to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in a rabbit model. Methods: Twelve New Zealand white rabbits bearing VX2 tumors in the liver were treated with TACE. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with various b values was performed using the same protocol before and 3 d after treatment with TACE. ADC values and CNR of each tumor pre- and post-treatment with different b factors were analyzed. Correlation between ADC values and extent of necrosis in histological specimens was analyzed by a Pearson's correlation test. Results: The quality of diffusion-weighted images diminished as the b value increased. A substantial decrease in the mean lesion-to-liver CNR was observed on both pre- and post-treatment DW images, the largest difference in CNR pre- and post-treatment was manifested at a b value of 1000 s/mm

78649645424	Evaluation of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in monitoring early response of locally advanced breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy	Objective: The aim of our study was to assess the value of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) in predicting early response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) and to assess the accuracy of DMRI in evaluating residual disease after NAC. Methods: DMRI were performed in 43 women with LABC (44 lesions, all were invasive ductal carcinoma) before, after the first and final cycle of NAC. Tumour volume, early enhanced ratio (E1), maximum enhanced ratio (Emax), and maximum enhanced time (Tmax), dynamic signal intensity-time curve were obtained during treatment. Residual tumour volumes obtained using DMRI were compared with pathological findings to assess the accuracy of DMRI. Results: After 1st cycle of NAC, the mean volume of responders decreased insignificantly, P > 0.05, but after NAC, mean volume of residual tumor decreased significantly (P < 0.01). Morphology change: 29 cases showed a concentric shrinkage pattern while 7 cases showed a dendritic shrinkage pattern. Significant differences were found in E1, Emax and Tmax between responders and non-responders (P < 0.05). After 1st cycle of NAC, E1, Emax and Tmax of responders changed significantly (P < 0.001); while there is no significant change in non-responders (P > 0.05). After NAC, dynamic signal intensity-time types were changed in responders, and tended to be significantly flattening, while no significant change was found in non-responders. The residual tumour volume correlation coefficient between DMRI and pathology measurements was very high (r = 0.866, P = 0.000). Conclusion: DMRI is useful to evaluate the early response to NAC in LABC. The presence and volume of residual disease in LABC patients treated with NAC could be accurately evaluated by DMRI. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79952216642	Management of recurrent intracranial aneurysms with coiling and stent	PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence of aneurysmal recurrence after stenting and compare our experiences in the treatment of recurrent intracranial aneurysms with recoiling, covered stent, or close monitoring. METHODS: Two hundred eighty eight patients with 296 intracranial aneurysms were treated with detachable coils endovascularly. All patients were given follow-up angiography after 3 months to over 1 year to identify recurrent aneurysms. Recoiling, covered stent, or close monitoring were performed for the patients with recurrent intracranial aneurysms. RESULTS: Angiography immediately after embolization showed total or near-total occlusion in 232 aneurysms, subtotal occlusion in 48, and partial occlusion in 16. Thirty-four aneurysms were recurrent at follow up after embolization. The rate of recurrence in aneurysms with subtotal or partial occlusion was 35.9% (23 of 64), whereas the recurrence rate was 4.7% (11 of 232) in aneurysms with total or near-total occlusion. Of the 34 recurrent aneurysms, 5 were reembolized with detachable coils alone, resulting in total or near-total occlusion. Nine aneurysm patients underwent stent-assisted coiling with 7 having total or near-total occlusion and 2 having subtotal occlusion. Five aneurysms were treated with balloon-assisted embolization, resulting in total or near-total occlusion. Four aneurysms were retreated with covered stents specially designed for the intracranial vasculature with total or near-total occlusion. The remaining 11 recurrent aneurysms were closely monitored because of lack of clinical indication for recoiling. CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysms treated with detachable coils may recur. Recurrence can be managed with coils alone, balloon or stent-assisted techniques, covered stents, or close monitoring. With the use of various techniques, recurrent aneurysms can be successfully managed. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

79952534544	Anticoagulation with warfarin for Budd-Chiari syndrome with chronic inferior vena cava thrombosis: An initial clinical experience	Background: To evaluate the initial clinical safety and feasibility of anticoagulation using warfarin for Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) with chronic inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis. Methods: Between October 2005 and June 2009, a total of 16 consecutive BCS patients with chronic IVC thrombosis were treated with warfarin. Warfarin was administered orally at 2.5 mg/d for approximately 3-12 months. Transluminal balloon dilatation of the IVC with a 30-mm balloon catheter was applied for the patients with complete resolution of the thrombus. Data relating to the technical success, angiographic results, complications, and final clinical outcome were collected retrospectively and follow-ups were performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the stent placement, and annually thereafter. Results: Warfarin was successfully used for anticoagulation in all patients without any complications. Patients were followed up as outpatients for 6.43 ± 2.19 months, and in 14 cases, complete disappearance of the thrombosis was achieved with successful treatment by balloon dilation. In two patients with partial resolution of the thrombosis, Z-stent placement was initiated to compress the thrombus to prevent migration of the thrombosis, followed by dilation of the IVC. During the follow-up for 20.94 ± 10.31 months after the procedure, all the IVC remained patent without complications or pulmonary embolus, and all patients were alive with resolution of symptoms at the time of this study. Conclusions: The use of warfarin for anticoagulation proved to be simple, safe, and feasible for BCS with chronic IVC thrombosis. © Annals of Vascular Surgery Inc.

79957873379	Localization and evaluation of sentinel lymph node in breast cancer from computed tomographic lymphography	Objective: This study aimed to determine the accuracy of computed tomographic (CT) localization and CT-based diagnosis of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) metastasis. Methods: Thirty-four patients with confirmed breast cancer underwent 40-row CT scanning, and the first one or several lymph node(s) in the lymphatic drainage pathway was/were defined as the SLN(s). Dye and γ probe-guided SLN biopsy was performed on all patients. To accurately localize the SLN, 19 patients (55.9%) underwent the percutaneous lymph node puncture procedure. The morphologic features of all the SLNs on CT scans were analyzed and compared with the SLN biopsy pathologic diagnosis. Results: Sentinel lymph nodes were successfully identified for all patients without any significant adverse effects. All localized SLNs corresponded well with SLNs identified on SLN biopsy, with an accuracy of 89.5%. Accuracy increased to 100% when the CT scan technique was combined with the blue dye method. The size criteria for metastatic diagnosis had a sensitivity of 85%, which increased to 94.7% when long-to-short-axis ratio and margin characteristics were also considered. Conclusions: The CT lymphography combined with the blue dye method accurately localized the SLNs. The CT-based diagnostic criteria improved the diagnostic accuracy of SLN metastases and were useful for evaluating the axillary status in early stage breast cancer patients.

79958260679	Morphological manifestations of nonpuerperal mastitis on magnetic resonance imaging	Purpose: To investigate the morphological features of nonpuerperal mastitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Materials and Methods: MRI results of 27 patients diagnosed with nonpuerperal mastitis were retrospectively analyzed according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). Results: According to the enhanced MRI results, 22 cases presented as nonmass-like enhancements and five cases presented as masses. For the 22 nonmass-like enhancement lesions, one case showed as a homogeneous enhancement and 21 cases showed as heterogeneous enhancements. In the 21 heterogeneous enhancement cases, 13 contained lesions of rim-like enhancement. With regard to the number of lesions with rim-like enhancement, 11 presented as multiple and two as single. In the five mass lesions, three presented as rim enhancements. Indications of rim or rim-like enhancement accounted for 59% (16/27) of all cases. For the 16 cases that presented with signs of rim or rim-like enhancement, the central hypointensity area surrounded by enhanced rim or rim-like entity showed as hyperintensity in 14 cases and hypointensity or heterointensity in two cases on T2-weighted imaging. Conclusion: On contrast-enhanced MRI, most nonpuerperal mastitis presented as nonmass-like lesion with heterogeneous signal intensity. The observation of signs of rim or rim-like enhancement on contrast-enhanced MRI with central hypointensity areas showing as hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging is suggestive of the possibility of nonpuerperal mastitis.

79959654821	Total embolization of the main splenic artery as a supplemental treatment modality for hypersplenism	AIM: To study the safety and feasibility of total embolization of the main splenic artery as a supplemental treatment modality for hypersplenism with thrombocytopenia or leukocytopenia accompanying liver cirrhosis. METHODS: Fifteen consecutive patients with hypersplenism due to cirrhosis were enrolled in this study from January 2006 to June 2010. All patients underwent total embolization of the main splenic artery. Clinical symptoms, white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) counts, splenic volume, and complications of the patients were recorded. The patients were followed up for 1 and 6 mo, and 1, 2, 3 years, respectively, after operation. RESULTS: Total embolization of the main splenic artery was technically successful in all patients. Minor complications occurred in 13 patients after the procedure, but no major complications were found. The WBC and PLT counts were significantly higher and the residual splenic volume was significantly lower 1 and 6 mo, and 1, 2, 3 years after the procedure than before the procedure (P < 0.01). Moreover, the residual splenic volume increased very slowly with the time after embolization. All patients were alive during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Total embolization of the main splenic artery is a safe and feasible procedure and may serve as a supplemental treatment modality for hypersplenism with thrombocytopenia or leukocytopenia accompanying liver cirrhosis. © 2011 Baishideng.

80051566466	Effect of intravenous gadolinium-DTPA on diffusion-weighted imaging for prostate lesions and normal tissue at 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging	Background: Post-contrast diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is occasionally necessary when the results of the pre-contrast DWI differ from that of the dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), however, the effects of contrast material on DWI image and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values have not been fully examined. Purpose: To assess whether the administration of gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA) significantly affects the DWI of prostate lesions or normal tissue at the 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3.0 T MRI). Material and Methods: Fifty-one patients with 52 prostate lesions, including 32 prostate cancer (25 in the peripheral zone [PZ] and seven that could not be confidently located) and 20 benign lesions (11 in PZ and nine in central grand [CG]), underwent echo-planar imaging (EPI)-DWI with b values of 0, 1000 s/mm

80755125802	Imaging findings in mucinous breast carcinoma and correlating factors	Objective: To investigate the factors influencing mammographic and sonographic features of mucinous breast carcinoma. Materials and methods: Forty-six patients diagnosed as mucinous breast carcinoma between March 2005 and April 2009 were studied. Mammographies of all patients and sonographies of 41 patients were analyzed retrospectively. Microscopic slides were re-evaluated by a pathologist in order to estimate the volume of extracellular mucus which was classified as: (+), less than 50% of mucus; (++), 50-80% of mucus; and (+++), more than 80% of mucus. Results: Thirty-one (61.3%) cases of pure mucinous type and 2 (33.3%) of mixed mucinous carcinoma presented as masses had well-defined margins on mammography. No correlation was found between margin characteristics and histological type as well as extracellular mucus rates. Denser breasts and young age group had significantly higher ratios of tumors presented with ill-defined masses than its counterpart. Sonographically, 100% lesions showed a hypoechoic lesion, 76.5% lesions in pure type and 71.4% lesions in mixed type showed a heterogeneous internal echo. No correlation was found between sonographic findings and histological type as well as extracellular mucus rates. Lesions with >40 positivity PCNA had higher ratio presented as ill-defined margins than those of ≤40% positivity PCNA. Conclusions: The most common appearance of mucinous breast carcinoma is a mass on mammography and a hypoechoic lesion with heterogeneous internal echo on sonography. Mammographic margins and sonographic findings have no relation with histological type and extracellular mucus rate. Mammographic margin features are correlated with breast density and age and PCNA. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

82555168123	Imaging diagnosis of colorectal liver metastases	Rapid advances in imaging technology have improved the detection, characterization and staging of colorectal liver metastases. Multi-modality imaging approach is usually the more useful in diagnosis colorectal liver metastases. It is well established that hepatic resection improves the long-term prognosis of many patients with liver metastases. However, incomplete resection does not prolong survival, so knowledge of the exact extent of intra-hepatic disease is crucially important in determining patient management and outcome. The diagnosis of liver metastases relies first and totally on imaging to decide which patients may be surgical candidates. This review will discuss the imaging options and their appropriate indications. Imaging and evaluating of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) have been performed with contrast-enhanced ultrasound, multi-detector computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with extra-cellular contrast media and liver-specifi c contrast media MRI, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography. This review will concentrate on the imaging approach of CRLM, and also discuss certain characteristics of some liver lesions. We aim to highlight the advantages of each imaging technique, as well as underscoring potential pitfalls and limitations. © 2011 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84855536580	Imaging findings in phyllodes tumors of the breast	Purpose: To study the radiological appearance and pathological features of breast phyllodes tumors (PTs), and to enhance the recognition of the tumor. Materials and methods: Clinical and imaging findings were retrospectively reviewed in 24 women with PTs confirmed by surgical pathology. All of the 24 patients had preoperative MRI and sonography, and 10 had preoperative mammography. Results: The histologic findings were benign, borderline and malignant PTs in 16.7% (4/24), 45.8% (11/24) and 37.5% (9/24) of cases, respectively. The tumor size (p = 0.001), irregular shape on sonographic imaging (p = 0.039), internal non-enhanced septations (p = 0.009), silt-like changes in enhanced images (p = 0.006) and signal changes from T2-weighted to enhanced images on MRI (p = 0.001) correlated significantly with the histologic grade; the BI-RADS category of the MRI could reflect the PT's histologic grade with a correlation coefficient of 0.440 (p = 0.031). If the category BI-RADS ≥4a was considered to be a suspicious malignant lesion, the diagnostic accuracy of mammography, US and MRI would be 70% (7/10), 62.5% (15/24) and 95.8% (23/24), respectively. Conclusion: The tumor size and several US and MRI findings can be used to help preoperatively determine the histologic grade of breast PTs. When a patient presents with a progressively enlarging, painless breast mass, MRI should be recommended first. Crown Copyright © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

84855570369	MRI morphological classification of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) correlating with different biological behavior	Objective: To investigate morphological appearance of ductal carcinoma in situ of breast on MRI and to correlate the appearances with some factors. Methods and materials: MRI feature of 41 DCISs were analyzed retrospectively according to ACR BI-RADS, twenty-three of the 41 were pure DCIS and 18 were DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-MI). The shape was categorized as mass lesion and non-mass-like lesion. The shape was correlated with histological grade, ER status and expression of e-erbB2 as well as pure DCIS or DCIS-MI. Results: Percentage of high grade in non-mass-like lesion was higher than that in mass type group, Average size of tumor in group of high grade, negative ER status and positive c-erbB2 expression were larger than that in non-high grade, positive ER status and negative c-erbB2 expression. Comparing pure DCIS and DCIS-MI, high grade in DCIS-MI was significantly higher than that in pure DCIS, Average size of DCIS-MI was larger than that in pure DCIS. Percentage of non-mass-like lesion was higher in DCIS-IM than that in pure DCIS, the difference was marginally significant. Conclusion: DCIS can be classified as mass type and non-mass-like type morphologically on MRI. The two types reflect different biological behavior. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

84856951078	Primary adrenal lymphoma: Radiological; Pathological, clinical correlation	Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze CT and MR imaging (MRI) manifestation of primary adrenal lymphoma in order to better understand of this rare disease. Materials and methods: Six patients (4 men, 2 women; median age, 65.5 years) with pathologically proven primary adrenal lymphoma were retrospectively reviewed. Imaging findings (CT&MRI, n = 3; only CT, n = 3) were analyzed and correlated with clinical and pathologic findings. Results: All cases were pathologically proven primary adrenal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with bilateral lesions in 3 cases respectively. Maximum diameters of the 9 lesions were 6.1-14.8 cm, median 10.5 cm. Seven lesions were round, oval or oblong, and 2 lesions irregular. Seven lesions were well-defined and 2 had ill-defined margins. Unenhanced CT density of 9 lesions and MR signal intensity of T1 weighted images of 6 lesions were similar to that of muscle, and all 6 lesions were hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images. Following intravenous injection of contrast media, 6 lesions had mild enhancement and 3 lesions had moderate enhancement on parenchymal phase imaging. Enhancement was homogenous in three, slightly inhomogeneous in four, and heterogeneous in two. Seven lesions, in 5 cases, infiltrated the adjacent tissues or organs in patients with large tumors. Conclusion: Primary adrenal lymphoma usually manifests as large, well-defined, soft-tissue masses replacing the adrenal gland with homogeneous or slightly inhomogeneous enhancement. Large tumors especially tend to infiltrate adjacent structures. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

84859190865	Magnetic resonance imaging of the breast in evaluating residual diseases at lumpectomy site soon after excisional biopsy	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the detection of residual disease for patients after excisional biopsy of breast carcinoma, before re-excision. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 97 patients who underwent MRI soon after excisional biopsy of breast carcinoma with undeterminable margin status before further surgical intervention to determine the value of MRI in detecting residual disease. RESULTS: The positive predictive value was 50.0%. The negative predictive value was 78.9%. The MRI detected 54.5% of the residual disease for invasive ductal carcinoma and 100% for ductal carcinoma in situ. Positive predictive value and sensitivity for MRI conducted within 14 days of the original surgery were lower than those for MRI conducted after 14 days of the original surgery, being 31.6% and 46.2% versus 66.7% and 73.4%, respectively. The difference between the positive predictive value within 14 days versus after 14 days was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance imaging in detecting residual disease soon after excisional biopsy for breast carcinoma had a low positive predictive value and moderately high negative predictive value. Magnetic resonance imaging was more sensitive in detecting residual ductal carcinoma in situ than invasive ductal carcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging conducted more than 14 days after the original biopsy had a significantly higher positive predictive value than MRI done within 14 days. © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

84860812664	The feasibility of breast cancer sentinel lymph node mapping at CT lymphography	Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of sentinel lymph node(SLN) mapping with CT lymphography (CT-LG). Methods: Twenty-five patients with confirmed breast cancer and no palpably axillary lymph node underwent CT-LG examination. The first one or more lymph nodes along the lymph duct draining from the injection sites to axilla were defined as SLNs, and then the LG Results: were compared with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The over- and underestimation of LG were evaluated. The quality of LG imaging was classified Grade I and II according to lymph duct appearance on volume rendering (VR). The body mass index (BMI)>25 was considered obesity. Fisher exact test was used for the statistics. Results: (1) Of 25 patients, 5 had local mastectomy history. BMI<25 was found in 20 cases, and ≥25 was in 5 cases. (2) All SLNs were showed by CT-LG, and Grade I and II imaging quality were achieved in 21 cases (84.0%) and 4 cases (16.0%), respectively. The obese patient tended to have a poor imaging quality (P<0.05). (3)Fifty-six SLNs and 45 lymph ducts in all 25 patients were identified on CT-LG. Compared with the Results: of SLNB, 7 cases (28.0%) and 9 cases (36.0%) were over- and underestimated respectively by CT-LG due to obesity and local mastectomy (P<0.05). (4) Fifty-two negative SLNs in 18 patients and 15 positive SLNs in 7 patients were confirmed by pathology through SLNB, while 56 SLNs were delineated on CT-LG with 43 negative and 13 positive. The shape in 32.6% of the negative SLNs (14/43) and 76.9% of the positive SLNs (10/13) was round, the difference was significant (P<0.05). The filling defect on the center in 9.3% of negative SLNs (4/43) and 23.1% of positive SLNs (3/13) was demonstrated, and irregular filling defect on the margin was found only in 30.8% of positive SLNs (4/13). 3 SLNs in 2 patients combined with small satellite lymph nodes on CT-LG were also confirmed to have tumor infiltration. Conclusion: CT-LG can clearly demonstrate the breast lymphatic pathway and may potentially be used for breast SLN mapping, while the imaging quality can be influenced by the obesity and local mastectomy. © 2010 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84860892864	MRI characteristics of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast	Objective: To evaluate and recognize the dynamic and morphological MRI charactristics of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast and provide imaging information for the early detection and treatment planning. Methods: All MRI data in 71 patients with histologically proved DCIS were analyzed retrospectively. The 71 patients were divided into two groups, N1 (pure DCIS, 44 patients) and N2 (DCIS with microinvasion, 27 patients). According to the BI-RADS descriptors, all lesions were defined as a focus (smaller than 5 mm in diameter), mass and no-mass-like three enhancement types. The morphological features (M1 = focus, M2 = linear or linear-branched, M3 = branching-ductal, M4 = segmental, M5 = focal, M6 = regional, M7 = diffuse, M8 = mass) and the time-intensity curve (TIC) pattern [type I (persistent enhancement curves), type II (plateau), type III (washout) and type IV (the same enhancement as glandular tissue)] were described. Chi-square test was used for the morphological characteristics of lesions. Results: The 73 DCIS lesions were found in 71 patients, and 5.5% (n =4) were stippled lesions, 87.7% (n =64) were no-mass-like lesions, 6.8% (n =5) were mass-like lesions. In no-mass-like lesions (n = 64), M3 was found in 15 cases, M4 in 34 cases, M5 in 9 cases and M6 in 6 cases, respectively, M3 and M4 were the most common distribution patterns. In N1 group (n =45) and N2 group (n =28), M3, M4, M5, M6 were found in 7 and 8, 21 and 13, 7 and 2, 3 and 3 cases, respectively. There were no statistic differences between two groups (P > 0.05). In 31 showed heterogeneous enhancement, both M3 and M4 were observed in 35.5% (11/31). In 26 clustered ring enhancement lesions, M4 was observed in 88.5% (23/26). Four lesions showed reticular enhancement, 2 lesions showed a clumped enhancement and 1 lesion showed homogeneous enhancement. In 5 mass-like lesions, N1 group had 3 cases, N2 group had 2 cases. Four lesions showed lobulated margin, 4 lesions showed speculated margin, 1 mass showed smooth margin. Five mass showed heterogeneous enhancement. Type I, type II, type III and type IV TIC (n = 25) were demonstrated in 8, 11, 3 and 3 lesions, respectively. Conclusions: M3, M4, especially segmental clustered ring enhancement, are the most common morphological characteristics of DCIS. Type I and type II TIC are the most common types. © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

Method: Clinical and MRI findings were retrospectively reviewed in twenty-seven women with 28 PTs lesions confirmed by surgical pathology. Statistical analyses were one-way ANOVA for size analysis, Fisher exact test for analysis of MR appearances and Spearman correlation to study the relationship between MRI findings and BI-RADS categories. Results: (1) The histologic findings were benign, borderline and malignant PTs in 14.3% (4/28), 53.6% (15/28) and 32.1% (9/28) of lesions, respectively. (2) The mean maximum-diameter were (6.4 ±3.9) cm, (5.7 ±2.2) cm in borderline type and (4.8 ± 1.8) cm in benign type respectively. The results showed differences in lesion's size among the three type (F = 287.541, P - 0.000), especially between malignant and benign type (P = 0.033). (3) Internal non-enhanced septations and silt-like changes on enhanced images, as well as time-signal curve on MRI correlated significantly with the histological grade (P < 0.05). (4) If the category BI-RADS ≥ 4a was considered to be a suspicious sign for malignant lesion, the diagnostic accuracy of MRI would be 96.4% (27/28), and the BI-RADS category of the MRI could reflect the PT's histological grade with a low correlation coefficient (r = 0.382, P = 0.045). Conclusion: The findings of PT on MRI have some characteristics, with tumor size and several MRI features correlating with the histological grade of breast PT.

Methods: The records of all patients undergoing VATS resection for solitary pulmonary nodules preoperatively localized by CT-guided a Hook-wire system were assessed with respect to failure to localize the lesion by the Hook-wire system, conversion thoracotomy rate, duration of operation, postoperative complications, and histology of nodular pulmonary lesions. Results: Sixty-eight patients with seventy four nodules underwent VATS resections. Preoperative CT-guided Hook-wire localization succeeded in all patients (100.0%). Conversion thoracotomy was necessary in 2 patients. The average operative time was (15±6)min. Asymptomatic complication rate was 70.6% (48/68), asymptomatic pneumothorax rate, asymptomatic hemorrhage rate and simultaneous pneumothorax and bleeding rate were 45.6% (31/68), 25.0% (17/68) and 4.4% (3/68), respectively. The mean hospitalization was (15±6) days. Histological assessment revealed primary lung cancer (NSCLC) in 30, metastasis in 18, and nonmalignant disease in 26 nodules. Conclusions: Video-assisted thoracoscopic resection of nodular pulmonary lesions previously localized by a CT-guided Hook-wire system is related to a low conversion thoracotomy rate, short operation time, and high safety.

84863197265	Application of 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging in endometrial cancer	Objective To determine the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting myometrial invasion, cervical involvement and disease stage in endometrial cancer. Methods 168 consecutive patients with endometrial carcinoma underwent preoperative MRI. We classified myometrial invasion as no invasion, B50% invasion or[50% invasion and cervical involvement as positive or negative. The preoperative MRI findings and stagings were compared with final surgical and histological staging; the latter was taken as the gold standard. Standard statistical calculations were used. Results The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRI for the detection of myometrial invasion[50% were 64.7, 92.5, and 86.9%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 68.8 and 91.2%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRI for the detection of cervical invasion were 52.63, 93.08, and 83.93%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 68.97 and 87.05%, respectively. 102 cases were classified as stage IA (early disease) by histology. MRI accurately predicted the degree of invasion in 88 cases and overestimated in 14, giving a sensitivity of 86.3% and specificity of 69.1%. However, MRI showed reduced sensitivity for predicting stage IB and advanced endometrial cancer (stages III and IV) at 33.3 and 30.3%, respectively, but was found to be specific for predicting these stages; the specificity were 94.7 and 85.1%, respectively. MRI also showed good accuracy for predicting stage IA, IB, II and advanced endometrial cancer at 80.4, 86.9, 91.7, and 83.9, respectively. Conclusion MRI assists in planning the surgical treatment of endometrial cancer with good accuracy and specificity, although sensitivity is suboptimal. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

84863902277	Comparison of total splenic artery embolization and partial splenic embolization for hypersplenism	AIM: To evaluate whether total splenic artery embolization (TSAE) for patients with hypersplenism delivers better long-term outcomes than partial splenic embolization (PSE). METHODS: Sixty-one patients with hypersplenism eligible for TSAE (n = 27, group A) or PSE (n = 34, group B) were enrolled into the trial, which included clinical and computed tomography follow-up. Data on technical success, length of hospital stay, white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) counts, splenic volume and complications were collected at 2 wk, 6 mo, and 1, 2, 3, 4 years postoperatively. RESULTS: Both TSAE and PSE were technically successful in all patients. Complications were significantly fewer (P = 0.001), and hospital stay significantly shorter (P = 0.007), in group A than in group B. Post-procedure WBC and PLT counts in group A were significantly higher than those in group B from 6 mo to 4 years (P = 0.001), and post-procedure residual splenic volume in group A was significantly less than that observed in group B at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years post-procedure (P = 0.001). No significant differences were observed in red blood cell counts and liver function parameters between the two groups following the procedure. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that TSAE for patients with hypersplenism not only delivers a better long-term outcome, but is also associated with lower complication rates and a shorter hospital stay than PSE. © 2012 Baishideng.

84867711636	Safety and efficacy of splenic artery coil embolization for hypersplenism in liver cirrhosis	Background: Partial splenic artery embolization is an effective treatment for hypersplenism but often lacks long-term benefits. Purpose: To evaluate the long-term effects of coil embolization of the splenic artery in patients with liver cirrhosis and hypersplenism. Material and Methods: Forty-nine patients with liver cirrhosis and hypersplenism underwent coil embolization of the main splenic artery. The coils were deployed in the mid- or distal segment of the splenic artery to allow collateral blood flow to the spleen. The following data were collected from 2 weeks to 4 years after the embolization: Technical success, length of hospital stay, white blood cell count, platelet count, splenic volume, and complication. Results: The technical success rate of splenic artery coil embolization was 100%. The post embolization syndrome rate was 75% (36/49) with no incidence of major complications. The mean length of hospital stay was 9 days. After embolization, the patient's white blood and platelet counts increased significantly, peaked at 2 weeks, and gradually decreased during the 4-year follow-up period, but remained at significantly higher levels than pre-embolization levels. Follow-up CT scans demonstrated a gradual increase in the volume of the enhanced portions of the spleens with a decrease in the volume of unenhanced portion. No significant changes occurred in the red blood cell count and liver function after the embolization. Conclusion: Embolization of the mid-and distal main splenic artery with coils is a safe and effective treatment of hypersplenism in cirrhosis with long-term hematologic benefits.

84868538080	Advanced breast angiosarcoma completely responding to gemcitabine- containing chemotherapy	Background: For patients with anthracycline-resistant metastatic angiosarcoma, there is currently no available standard for second-line therapy, and a need exists for novel effective regimens to improve response rates. Case Report: We report here on a case of a primary angiosarcoma of both breasts in a 34-year-old woman presenting with lung metastases. Upon completion of 3 cycles of the MAID regimen (mesna, adriamycin, ifosfamide, dacarbazine), computed tomography showed disease progression. Subsequently, a secondline chemotherapy was started using the GVP regimen (gemcitabine, vincristine, cisplatin). Complete response of the lung metastases was achieved after 6 cycles of treatment. Conclusion: In the absence of an effective therapy among patients with anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast angiosarcoma, a GVP chemotherapy regimen can be performed as a selective option. © 2012 S.

84871513528	Application of Breast Ultrasound in a Mammography-Based Chinese Breast Screening Study	We evaluated the clinical significance of the combined use of mammography + ultrasound as a new breast screening strategy. The inclusion criteria were: (1) females aged >40yrs; (2) breast cancer diagnosis by the breast image screening personnel at FUSCC; (3) screening by both ultrasound and mammography; (4) mammographic/sonographic images analyzed independently by different radiologists; and (5) follow-up for at least 1 year. Fifty-four women were enrolled. The analysis included diagnostic sensitivity of mammography, ultrasound, and mammography + ultrasound. The sensitivities of mammography and mammography + ultrasound were compared overall as well as among different age groups/breast densities. The screening sensitivity of mammography, ultrasound, and mammography + ultrasound was 79. 6, 57. 4, and 92. 6 %, respectively. The difference between mammography and mammography + ultrasound was significant (P < 0. 05). The benefit of including ultrasound with mammography as a new breast image screening strategy was found statistically significant in patients with dense breast on mammogram while it was non-significant in younger (<50 years) women. We, therefore, concluded that mammography + ultrasound increased the diagnostic sensitivity of breast screening; hence it was more desirable for women with dense breast on mammography. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84874763576	Biexponential apparent diffusion coefficients values in the prostate: Comparison among normal tissue, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis	Objective: To investigate the biexponential apparent diffusion parameters of diverse prostate tissues and compare them with monoexponential apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value in the efficacy to discriminate prostate cancer from benign lesions. Materials and Methods: Eleven healthy volunteers and 61 patients underwent a conventional (b-factors 0, 1000 s/mm2) and a 10 b-factor (0 to 3000 s/mm2) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The monoexponential ADC value and biexponential parameters of fast ADC (ADCf), fraction of ADCf (f), slow ADC (ADCs) value for 29 prostate cancer, 28 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 24 prostatitis lesions and normal tissue were calculated and compared. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity, specificity and optimal cut-off points. Results: Prostate cancer had lower ADC, ADCf, f, and ADCs than all other tissues (p < 0.01). Prostatitis exhibited a lower ADC, ADCf, ADCs and f than the peripheral zone tissue (p < 0.01), and BPH showed a lower ADC and ADCf than the central gland tissue (p < 0.01). The ADCf demonstrated a comparable accuracy with ADC in differentiating cancer from BPH [area under the curve (AUC) 0.93 vs. 0.92] and prostatitis AUC 0.98 vs. 0.99) (both p > 0.05), but the AUC of f and ADCs in differentiating cancer from BPH (0.73 and 0.81) and prostatitis (0.88 and 0.91) were significantly lower than ADC (all p < 0.05). Conclusion: The biexponential DWI appears to provide additional parameters for tissue characterization in prostate, and ADCf helps to yield comparable accuracy with ADC in differentiating cancer from benign lesions.

84875279284	The CT findings of pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma in five cases	Objectives: The aim of this study is to analyze the computed tomographic (CT) findings of pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (ACC). Materials and methods: The CT features and clinical presentations of five patients (four men, one woman; mean age, 52 years) with pathology-proven pancreatic ACC were reviewed. The image characteristics included the lesion location and size, the exophytic nature of the tumor, intratumoral hemorrhage, calcification, the presence of cystic or necrotic components, bile or pancreatic duct dilation, attenuation on the noncontrast image, attenuation on the arterial- and venous-phase images, peripancreatic invasion, peripancreatic lymphadenopathy, and distant metastases. Results: The tumors were located at the pancreatic tail in three cases and at the pancreatic head in two cases. The average lesion size was 5.3 cm. Exophytic features and cystic/necrotic components were found in 80% (4/5) and 60% (3/5) of cases, respectively. The ACC showed a mild hypodense appearance on noncontrast CT in 100% (3/3) of cases and a hypodense appearance on arterial-/venous-phase CT in 80% (4/5) of cases. The exception was one lesion that showed a significantly hyperdense appearance and a mildly hyperdense appearance on the arterial- and venous-phase images. None of the CT images showed enhancement of a capsule, calcification, intratumoral hemorrhage, bile or pancreatic duct dilation, vascular encasement, or distant metastatic disease, but three cases showed peripancreatic invasion and lymphadenopathy. Conclusions: With persistent mild enhancement, the typical ACC appears as an exophytic tumor with a focal cystic/necrotic component and the lack of ductal dilatation. The predilection for older male patients and elevated serum alpha fetoprotein are useful clinical features for confirming an ACC diagnosis. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84876034491	Radiological and clinical features of adult non-puerperal mastitis	Objective: To describe the radiological and clinical features of adult non-puerperal mastitis and to determine the most accurate method of preventing unnecessary surgical procedures. Methods: Clinical and imaging findings were retrospectively reviewed in 51 females with non-puerperal mastitis, which was confirmed by biopsy/surgical pathology. All 51 patients had pre-operative MRI; 45 patients also had sonograms and 25 also had mammograms, pre-operatively. Results: Of the 51 cases with non-puerperal mastitis, 94.1% (48/51) were confirmed as having acute or chronic inflammation, and the other 3 had plasma cell mastitis; areola papillaris inflammation was found in 39.2% (20/51) of the cases. Overall, 6 of the 25 cases that were examined with mammogra-phy and 2 of the 45 cases that were examined with sonography appeared normal, but all 51 lesions were positively identified on MRI. Asymmetrical density (12/25) on mammograms and solitary or separated/contiguous, clustered, hypoechoic mass-like lesions (31/45) on ultrasound were the most common signs of non-puerperal mastitis. On enhanced MRI, 90.2% (46/51) of patients showed non-mass-like enhanced lesions. Multiple regional enhancements in the pattern of distribution (32/46) and separated or contiguous, clustered, rim-like enhancements in the pattern of internal enhancement (29/46) were the most common manifestations in non-mass-like enhanced lesions. Of the 51 patients, mastitis Type 1 and Type 2 in the time-signal intensity curve were detected in 47.1% and 51.0% of the patients, respectively. The breast imaging reporting and data system categories with the highest number of patients were Category 0 (9/25) on mammography, Category 4a on sonog-raphy (18/45) and Category 4a on MRI (29/51). Conclusion: The findings from mammogra-phy and ultrasound are non-specific; therefore, using MR can be helpful in the diagnosis, especially in the presence of non-mass-like enhancements that are multiple, regional, separated, or contiguous, clustered and rim-like. Advances in knowledge: Mastitis is often neglected because of the lack of typical clinical signs and symptoms. This study has assessed and described the clinical features and imaging findings of adult non-puerperal mastitis on mammograms, sonograms and MRI and found that MRI is more specific in the diagnosis of disease. © 2013 The Authors.

84877056423	Rattle-structured multifunctional nanotheranostics for synergetic chemo-/radiotherapy and simultaneous magnetic/luminescent dual-mode imaging	Most hypoxic tumors are insensitive to radiation, which is a major obstacle in the development of conventional radiotherapy for tumor treatment. Some drugs, such as cisplatin (CDDP), have been extensively used both as an anticancer drug and clinically as a radiosensitizer to enhance radiotherapy. Herein, we develop rattle-structured multifunctional up-conversion core/porous silica shell nanotheranostics (UCSNs) for delivering CDDP to tumors for synergetic chemo-/radiotherapy by CDDP radiosensitization and magnetic/luminescent dual-mode imaging. UCSNs had a dynamic light scattering diameter of 79.1 nm and excellent water dispersity and stability. In vitro studies showed that CDDP loaded in UCSNs (UCSNs-CDDP) was more effective than free CDDP as a radiosensitizer. After injection, UCSNs-CDDP also demonstrated unambiguously enhanced radiotherapy efficacy in vivo. Our report aims at presenting a novel strategy in biomedical nanotechnology that allows simultaneous dual-mode imaging and localized therapy via synergetic chemo-/radiotherapy, which may achieve optimized therapeutic efficacy in cancer treatment. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84878540863	Visualising liver fibrosis by phase-contrast X-ray imaging in common bile duct ligated mice	Objectives: To determine whether phase-contrast X-ray imaging can be used to visualise directly the accumulated extracellular matrix proteins associated with liver fibrosis in common bile duct ligated mice. Methods: Twenty-six-week-old C57BL female mice were randomised into three groups. In groups 1 (n = 5) and 2 (n = 10), common bile duct ligation was conducted to produce secondary biliary cirrhosis. Mouse livers were then excised 15 (group 1) and 40 days (group 2) after the ligation of the common bile duct for imaging. In the control group, the livers of 5 mice were excised 40 days after the sham operation. Images were then acquired using the analyser crystal set at different positions of the rocking curve. Results: The results show that the fibrotic septa and hepatic lobules enclosed by fibrotic septa can be visualised clearly at the whole organ level via phase-contrast X-ray imaging without any contrast agent. Conclusion: These results suggest that phase-contrast X-ray imaging can easily reveal the accumulated extracellular matrix proteins associated with liver fibrosis without using any contrast agent and has great potential in the study of liver fibrosis. Key Points: • Phase-contrast X-ray imaging may aid the study of liver fibrosis. • It provides higher contrast and spatial resolution (ca. 10 μm) than conventional radiography. • It can reveal fibrotic septa, small ducts and vessels without using contrast agents. • Results in animals now need to be translated to human clinical practice. © 2012 European Society of Radiology.

84878257470	Rectal gastrointestinal stromal tumors: Imaging features with clinical and pathological correlation	AIM: To investigate computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) manifestations of rectal gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) in order to enhance the recognition of these rare tumors. METHODS: Fourteen patients with pathologically proven rectal GISTs were retrospectively reviewed. Patient histories were retrospectively reviewed for patient age, gender, presenting symptoms, endoscopic investigations, operation notes and pathologic slides. All tumors were evaluated for CD117, CD34 expression, and the tumors were stratified according to current criteria of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In all cases the first pre-operation imaging findings (CT and MRI, n = 3; MRI only, n = 8; CT only, n = 3) were analyzed by two experienced radiologists by consensus, which include: tumor size, shape, CT density (hypodense, isodense and hyperdense), MRI signal intensity (hypointense, isointense and hyperintense), epicenter (intraluminal or extraluminal), margin (well-defined or ill-defined), internal component (presence of calcifications, necrosis, hemorrhage or ulceration), pattern and degree of enhancement, invasion into adjacent structures. After review of the radiologic studies, clinical and pathological findings were correlated with radiological findings. RESULTS: The patients, 13 men and 1 woman, were aged 31-62 years (mean = 51.5 ± 10.7 years). The most common initial presentation was hematochezia (n = 6). The mean tumor diameter was 5.68 ± 2.64 cm (range 1.5-11.2 cm). Eight lesions were round or oval, and 6 lesions were irregular. Eleven lesions were welldefined and 3 had ill-defined margins. Ten tumors were extraluminal and 4 were intraluminal. The density and MR signal intensity of the solid component of the lesions were similar to that of muscle on unenhanced CT (n = 6) and T1-weighted images (n = 11), and hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images. Calcification was detected in 2 tumors. Following intravenous injection of contrast media, 3 lesions had mild enhancement and 11 lesions had moderate enhancement. Enhancement was homogenous in 3 lesions and heterogeneous in 11. In 1 of 11 patients who underwent both CT and MRI, the tumor was homogenous on CT scan and heterogeneous on MRI. Eight patients were classified as high risk according to the modified recurrent risk classification system of NIH. CONCLUSION: Rectal GISTs usually manifest as large, well-circumscribed, exophytic masses with moderate and heterogeneous enhancement on CT and MRI. The invasion of adjacent organs, bowel obstruction and local adenopathy are uncommon. © 2013 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84881236624	Performance of breast cancer screening methods and modality among Chinese women: A report from a society-based breast screening program (SBSP) in Shanghai	To evaluate the screening performance of individual and combined use of clinical breast examination, ultrasonography and mammography in Chinese women, we conducted a biennial breast cancer screening program among 14,464 women aged 35 to 74 years old who lived in Qibao County, Minhang district of Shanghai, China, between May 2008 and Sept 2012. All participants were submitted to clinical breast examination, and then women with positive results and all women at age of 45-69 years old were preformed breast ultrasonography and mammography. The examination results were compared against pathological findings as the gold standard of reference. A total of 66 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in the two rounds of the screening, yielding an incident rate of 194 per 100,000 person-years. The sensitivity of clinical breast examination, ultrasonography and mammography alone were 61.4%, 53.7% and 67.3%, respectively. While mammography performed better in elder age groups and hormone receptor positive disease groups, ultrasonography had a higher sensitivity in younger age group and did not differ in sensitivity by estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor status. Combined use of the two imaging examinations increased the sensitivity in almost all age groups, but had a higher sensitivity in hormone receptor positive cancers than in those negative. Our results suggest that the Qibao modality is an effective strategy for breast cancer screening among Chinese women, especially for early detection of elder and hormone receptor positive breast cancer. © 2013 Mo et al.

84881272735	Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast: Mammography features correlated with sonography and histopathological findings	Objective The purpose of this study was to describe the X-ray features of the neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) of breast to raise the awareness for the disease. Methods The mammography, sonography and clinicopathologic features in a total of 16 cases of pathologically proven breast neuroendocrine carcinoma in Fudan University Cancer Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. Results All the 16 patients were women with a mean age of 67.3 years old (ranged from 45 to 75 years old). Twelve patients had palpable masses and the other four patients had outflow from the nipple. Pathological diagnosis included endocrine ductal carcinoma in situ (E-DCIS) in 4 cases, E-DCIS with microinvasion in 5, and invasive solid neuroendocrine carcinoma in 7. On mammography, 9 of 16 cases exhibited round or slightly lobulated masses. Five of the 16 cases exhibited irregular or asymmetric opacities. Two of the 16 cases had negative findings. The borders of the 14 masses detected on mammography were vague in 7, partly unclear in 3 and clear-cut in 4 cases. Malignant microcalcification was not found in all cases. The accuracy rates of preoperative qualitative diagnosis for NEC with mammography and sonography were 68.8% (11/16) and 81.3% (13/16), respectively. Given the application of combined mammography and sonography, the accuracy rates could be improved to 87.5% (14/16). Conclusions A round mass and irregular or asymmetric opacities without malignant calcification are the most frequent appearances of mammography in neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast. Combination of mammography and sonography may be useful to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and early detection of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast.

84882765512	MicroRNA-199a-3p is downregulated in gastric carcinomas and modulates cell proliferation	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate the translation of targeted mRNAs. An increasing amount of evidence indicates that miRNAs play important role in cancer pathogenesis, apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Recently, miRNA-199a has been shown to be involved in many human cancers, although the role of miRNA-199a-3p in gastric cancer has not yet been evaluated. In the present study, the expression of miRNA-199a-3p was found to be significantly downregulated in human gastric cancer tissues and cells. miRNA-199a-3p induced anti-proliferation effects on human gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, using quantitative RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction) and luciferase reporter assays, mTOR was identified as a direct target gene of miRNA-199a-3p that is downregulated by it. In conclusion, our findings suggest that miRNA-199a-3p is associated with human gastric cancer through its ability to decrease cancer cell proliferation and target the mTOR signaling pathway, and, therefore, may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of human gastric cancer. ©FUNPEC-RP.

84884589676	Intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: Preliminary experience on the safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes	Purpose: To investigate the effectiveness and toxicity of intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy as a therapeutic modality for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and Methods: In a retrospective study, 40 patients with stage III NSCLC received intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin. Tumor staining was graded based on angiography, and the number of NSCLC feeding arteries detected was recorded. Toxicity was assessed according to NatResultsional Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events. The response to treatment was evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Efficacy was assessed based on time to tumor progression (TTP), and survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Prognostic factors influencing TTP and overall survival rate were evaluated by Cox regression analysis. Results: The most frequent drug-related adverse events were cough (n = 17; 42.5%), anorexia (n = 14; 35%), and pain (n = 9; 22.5%). Evaluated per RECIST, a total of 47.5% of patients (n = 19) exhibited response to therapy after completion of the first three cycles of intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy. The median TTP was 5 months. Patients had a median life expectancy of 9 months. By Cox regression analysis, tumor staining was shown to be an independent prognostic factor for TTP (relative risk, 0.405; 95% confidence interval, 0.216-0.760) and overall survival (relative risk, 0.348; 95% confidence interval, 0.185-0.656). Conclusions: Intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy for advanced lung cancer has the potential to reduce the size of tumors and has no severe adverse effects. © 2013 SIR.

84885020993	Intra-abdominal fibromatosis: Differentiation from gastrointestinal stromal tumour based on biphasic contrast-enhanced CT findings	Aim To identify the computed tomography (CT) criteria that differentiate intra-abdominal fibromatosis (IAF) from gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Materials and methods CT images of 34 pathologically proven cases of IAF (n = 15) and GIST (n = 19) were retrospectively reviewed. Location, contour, border, enhancement pattern, presence of necrosis, vessels, and air within the lesion were analysed. Long diameter (LD), short diameter (SD), LD/SD ratio, degree of enhancement, and lesion/aorta (L/A) CT attenuation ratio were measured and calculated. Significant CT criteria were identified using Fisher's exact test, grouped t-test, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Sensitivity and specificity values were calculated when single or multiple CT criteria were used. Results Extra-gastrointestinal location, ovoid or irregular contour, homogeneous enhancement, absence of intra-lesional necrosis, lower degree of enhancement, and L/A CT attenuation ratio differentiated IAF from GIST (p < 0.05). When any three of these eight criteria were combined, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing IAF were 100% (15 of 15) and 89.5% (17 of 19), respectively. Conclusion The following eight CT criteria are helpful to differentiate IAF from GIST: extra-gastrointestinal location, ovoid or irregular contour, homogeneous enhancement, absence of intra-lesional necrosis, a degree of enhancement of less than 40.5 HU in the arterial phase versus 46.5 HU in the portal venous phase, and an L/A CT attenuation ratio <0.315 in the arterial phase versus 0.525 in the portal phase. © 2013 The Royal College of Radiologists.

84886800193	Diffusion-weighted MRI of salivary glands with gustatory stimulation: Comparison before and after radiotherapy	Background: Xerostomia is the most prominent complication in patients with head and neck carcinoma after radiotherapy (RT). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) with gustatory stimulation may contribute to the evaluation of salivary gland function. Purpose: To investigate the value of DWI for quantifying physiological changes of the parotid gland during gustatory stimulation in patients before and after RT. Material and Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 28 consecutive patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma before and after RT and clinical xerostomia was also assessed. A DWI sequence was performed once at rest and continually repeated seven times during stimulation with ascorbic acid. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps for parotid glands at different time points and the range of increase with stimulation were calculated. Paired two-tailed Student t tests were used to compare the ADC values before and after stimulation, and before and after RT. Results: Before RT, the ADC showed an initial increase (P, 0.001) and then fluctuated during stimulation. After RT, as the clinical xerostomia changed from Grade 0 to Grade 2, the mean ADC at rest increased compared with the pre-RT value (P, 0.001). A similar response to stimulation was observed, but the range of increase between the maximum ADC during stimulation and the baseline value at rest was higher post-RT than pre-RT (P 0.022). The minimum ADC during stimulation was higher than the baseline value post-RT (P 0.028), but there was no difference pre-RT (P 0.603). Conclusion: DWI combined with gustatory stimulation seems to display the physiological changes of the parotid gland following RT and may be a potential tool for non-invasively assessing salivary gland function.

84886694238	The features of breast lymphoma on MRI	Objective: To investigate the morphological features of breast lymphoma (BL) on MRI. Methods: MRI features of 20 patients with BL (12 primary and 8 secondary) were reviewed according to Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System categories. Results: 19 cases were unilateral and 1 was bilateral. According to the enhanced images, of the 20 cases, BL presented as a mass in 11 (55%), as an enhancement with no mass effect in 7 (35%) and as a mass and mixed enhancement with no mass effect in 2 (10%). There were 38 masses and 44 lesions with no mass effect in our study. All lesions showed mild heterogeneous internal enhancement. For lesions with mass effect, the margins were smooth in 32% (12/38) and irregular in 68% (26/38); and the shape was oval in 87% (32/38). Kinetic curve assessment (13 cases, 38 lesions) revealed that the average initial rise rate was 104%. The type II enhancement curve appeared in 55% (21/38) of lesions. No significant differences between the primary and secondary BL were observed for any of the MRI features. Conclusion: BL mostly appeared oval with irregular margins showing mild heterogeneous internal enhancement and/or as enhanced lesions with no mass effect with mild heterogeneous internal enhancement. Advances in knowledge: Some special features on MRI are useful for the diagnosis of BL. © 2013 The Authors.

84894616533	Dual-targeting upconversion nanoprobes across the blood-brain barrier for magnetic resonance/fluorescence imaging of intracranial glioblastoma	Surgical resection, one of the main clinical treatments of intracranial glioblastoma, bears the potential risk of incomplete excision due to the inherent infiltrative character of the glioblastoma. To maximize the accuracy of surgical resection, the magnetic resonance (MR) and fluorescence imaging are widely used for the tumor preoperative diagnosis and intraoperative positioning. However, present commercial MR contrast agents and fluorescent dyes can only function for single mode of imaging and are subject to poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and nontargeting-specificity, resulting in the apparent risks of inefficient diagnosis and resection of glioblastoma. Considering the unique MR/upconversion luminescence (UCL) bimodal imaging feature of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), herein, we have developed a dual-targeting nanoprobe (ANG/PEG-UCNPs) to cross the BBB, target the glioblastoma, and then function as a simultaneous MR/NIR-to-NIR UCL bimodal imaging agent, which showed a much enhanced imaging performance in comparison with the clinically used single MRI contrast (Gd-DTPA) and fluorescent dye (5-ALA). Moreover, their biocompatibility, especially to brains, was systematically assessed by the histological/hematological examination, indicating a negligible in vivo toxicity. As a proof-of-concept, the ANG/PEG-UCNPs hold the great potential in MR diagnosis and fluorescence positioning of glioblastoma for the efficient tumor surgery. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

84896713524	Clinical outcomes and prediction of survival following percutaneous biliary drainage for malignant obstructive jaundice	The present study aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage in patients with obstructive jaundice and identify potential predictors of patient survival. Clinical data from 102 patients (66 males and 36 females; median age, 63.50 years; range, 29-84 years) with a mean (± standard deviation) pre-drainage serum bilirubin level of 285.4 (±136.7 μmol/l), were retrospectively studied. Technical and clinical success, complications and survival time were recorded and their relationship with clinical factors, including age, obstruction level, liver metastases, serum bilirubin level and subsequent treatments following drainage, were analyzed by Fisher's exact test. Patient survival rate and other predictors were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox's proportional hazard model. The technical and clinical success rates were 100 and 76.5%, respectively. The presence of liver metastases was associated with reduced successful drainage. The overall complication rate was 7.8% and the overall median survival time was 185 days [95% confidence interval (CI), 159-211 days]. A log-rank test showed that age (χ

84896740257	Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for focal liver lesions in Chinese patients: A multicenter, open-label, phase III study	Background: Contrast agents help to improve visibility in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, owing to the large interstitial spaces of the liver, there is a reduction in the natural contrast gradient between lesions and healthy tissue. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the liver-specific MR imaging contrast agent gadoxetate disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) in Chinese patients. Methods: This was a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study in patients with known or suspected focal liver lesions referred for contrast-enhanced MR imaging. MR imaging was performed in 234 patients before and after a single intravenous bolus of Gd-EOB-DTPA (0.025 mmol/kg body weight). Images were evaluated by clinical study investigators and three independent, blinded radiologists. The primary efficacy endpoint was sensitivity in lesion detection. Results: Gd-EOB-DTPA improved sensitivity in lesion detection by 9.46% compared with pre-contrast imaging for the average of the three blinded readers (94.78% vs 85.32% for Gd-EOB-DTPA vs pre-contrast, respectively). Improvements in detection were more pronounced in lesions less than 1 cm. Gd-EOB-DTPA improved diagnostic accuracy in lesion classification. Conclusions: This open-label study demonstrated that Gd-EOB-DTPA improves diagnostic sensitivity in liver lesions, particularly in those smaller than 1 cm. Gd-EOB-DTPA also significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy in lesion classification, and furthermore, Gd-EOB-DTPA is safe in Chinese patients with liver lesions. © 2013, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

84897363314	The computed tomographic findings of pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma	Purpose The aim of this study is to analyse the computed tomographic (CT) findings of pulmonary epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (EHE). Materials and methods The CT features and clinical presentations of six patients (five women, one man; mean age, 53 years) with pathology-proven pulmonary EHE were reviewed. Noncontrast CT images were available for three patients and enhanced CT images for three patients. The image characteristics included the number of tumours, tumour location and size, tumour margins, the presence of calcification/necrosis/cavity, the presence of perivascular location, the presence of pleural lesions, tumour homogeneity at contrast-enhanced CT, tumour enhancement relative to the adjacent muscle and the presence of extrapulmonary lesions. Results Multiple nodules/masses with irregular margin were shown in all cases, and reticulonodular opacities and ground-glass opacities were found in one case. Overall, the six cases showed 178 nodules/masses, 90 % (160/178) of which were <1 cm in diameter. The average size of the largest nodules/masses in each case was 2.7 cm. The nodules/masses were mostly (93 %, 166/178) located in the subpleural region (<2 cm from the pleura). A total of 48 % (86/178) of nodules/masses showed punctate calcification in four of six cases. All nodules/masses showed perivascular location. Pleural indentation was shown in all cases, as well as pleural-thickening in five cases and pleural effusion in two cases. On contrast-enhanced CT, EHE showed a mildly heterogeneous hyperdense appearance. Conclusions With predilection for subpleural and perivascular location, typical pulmonary EHE appears as multiple irregular nodules with punctate calcification and pleural indentation. © 2014 Italian Society of Medical Radiology.

84896917485	MRI appearances of stage I	BACKGROUND: The clinical symptoms of NK/T-cell lymphoma at presentation are nonspecific and may mimic those of other benign nasal diseases such as rhinitis and nasal polypus. However, radiologic studies regarding this aggressive clinical course entity are limited. AIM: To review 123 newly diagnosed MRI appearances in patients with extra-nodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, in a large cohort and determine the characteristic imaging findings. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We investigated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of patients with newly diagnosed stage IE/IIE extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, in the upper aerodigestive tract. RESULTS: Most nasal cavity patients (63.4%) showed extra nasal cavity involvements. The polypoid pattern was most frequently seen (55.3%), followed by the infiltrative (27.6%) and combined (17.1%) patterns. The polypoid pattern tended to develop in the nasal cavity group, while the infiltration pattern was more common in the non-nasal cavity group (63.4% vs. 60.0%, p < 0.001). Homogeneous iso-intensity was seen in 97.6%, 88.6% and 56.1% of cases on T1-, T2-weighted images and post-contrast images, respectively. Bone destruction and necrosis were observed in 44.7% and 56.3% of patients. Both tumour necrosis and bone destruction were related to tumour size (p = 0.008, 0.001). Only 12.2% of patients had cervical lymphadenopathy Multi-region involvement, irregular growth pattern, predisposition to necrosis and bone destruction, and little lymphadenopathy are valuable for diagnosis and can be used to differentiate these tumours from other malignant tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Our large cohort study of MRI of NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type, revealed the features of this lymphoma on MRI including some radiologic signs never reported earlier; these findings are invaluable for early diagnosis and may aid future studies aiming to predict the prognosis and response to therapy.

84898445448	Comparison of gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced breast MRI and gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced breast MRI with mammography and ultrasound for the detection of breast cancer	Purpose To compare gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI, mammography, and ultrasound for breast cancer detection across different malignant lesion types and across different densities of breast tissue. Materials and Methods In all, 153 women with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 3-5 findings on mammography and/or ultrasound underwent identical breast MRI exams at 1.5T with gadobenate dimeglumine and gadopentetate dimeglumine. Images were evaluated by three independent blinded radiologists. Mammography, ultrasound, and combined mammography and/or ultrasound findings were available for 108, 109, and 131 women. Imaging findings were matched with histology data by a fourth, independent, blinded radiologist. Malignant lesion detection rates and diagnostic performance were compared. Results In all, 120, 120, and 140 confirmed malignant lesions were present in patients undergoing MRI+mammography, MRI+ultrasound, and MRI+mammography and/or ultrasound, respectively. Significantly greater cancer detection rates were noted by all three readers for comparisons of gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI with mammography (Δ15.8-17.5%; P < 0.0001), ultrasound (Δ18.3-20.0%; P < 0.0001), and mammography and/or ultrasound (Δ8.6-10.7%; P ≤ 0.0105) but not for comparisons of gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI with conventional techniques (P > 0.05). The false-positive detection rates were lower on gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI than on conventional imaging (4.0-5.5% vs. 11.1% at mammography; 6.3-8.4% vs. 15.5% at ultrasound). Significantly improved cancer detection on MRI was noted in heterogeneously dense breast (91.2-97.3% on gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI vs. 77.2-84.9% on gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI vs. 71.9-84.9% with conventional techniques) and for invasive cancers (93.2-96.2% for invasive ductal carcinoma [IDC] on gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI vs. 79.7-88.5% on gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI vs. 77.0-84.4% with conventional techniques). Overall diagnostic performance for the detection of cancer was superior on gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI than on conventional imaging or gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI. Conclusion Gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI significantly improves cancer detection compared to gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI, mammography, and ultrasound in a selected group of patients undergoing breast MRI for preoperative staging or because of inconclusive findings at conventional imaging.

84899568555	Endovascular treatment of posttraumatic carotid-cavernous fistulas and pseudoaneurysms with covered stents	OBJECTIVE: The treatment of posttraumatic direct carotid-cavernous fistulas (TCCFs) with detachable balloons (DBs) is associated with relatively high recanalization rate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using covered stents in patients with posttraumatic carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCFs) and pseudoaneurysms. METHODS: Twelve patients with posttraumatic CCFs and 3 with pseudoaneurysms following detachable balloon deployment referred for treatment with covered stents were enrolled into this prospective study. Data on technical success, initial and final angiography results, mortality, morbidity, and the final clinical outcome, were retrospectively collected and analyzed at 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-months, and then annually. RESULTS: The navigation and deployment of the covered stents to the target CCF were technically successful in 14 of the 15 attempted stents, giving a successful technical rate of 93.3%. Angiography poststent placement showed complete occlusion in 11 patients with 11 CCFs, and incomplete occlusion in 3. Follow-up angiography revealed complete occlusion and no obvious in-stent stenosis in any patient. Clinical follow-up demonstrated full recovery in 13 patients, and an unchanged status in 1. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results indicate that the use of a covered stent is a feasible procedure for the treatment CCFs and pseudoaneurysms. © 2013 by the American Society of Neuroimaging.

84899627469	Real-time in vivo quantitative monitoring of drug release by dual-mode magnetic resonance and upconverted luminescence imaging	Insufficient or excess drug doses, due to unknown actual drug concentrations at the focus, are one of the main causes of chemotherapy failure for cancers. In this regard, the real-time monitoring of the release of anticancer drugs from nanoparticle drug delivery systems is of crucial importance, but it remains a critical and unsolved challenge. Herein, we report the proposal and development of a novel concept of real-time monitoring of NIR-triggered drug release in vitro and in vivo by using simultaneous upconverted luminescence (UCL) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Such a monitoring strategy features the high sensitivity of UCL and the high-resolution, noninvasiveness, and tissue-depth-independence of MR imaging. The dual-mode real-time and quantitative monitoring of drug release can be applied to determine online the drug concentrations in vivo in the tissue regions of interest and, therefore, to avoid insufficient or excess drug dosings. Lighting up drug delivery: Multifunctional Gd core/hollow mesoporous silica shell nanoparticles were synthesized. With doxorubicin (DOX) fully loaded inside the nanoparticles, the upconverted luminescence (UCL) signals are quenched through luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET), and the longitudinal relaxation time magnetic resonance (T

84902763459	Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography characteristics of renal cell carcinoma associated with Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion	Purpose: To characterize Xp11.2 translocation renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Methods: This study retrospectively collected the MRI and CT data of twelve patients with Xp11.2 translocation RCC confirmed by pathology. Nine cases underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and 6 cases underwent CT, of which 3 cases underwent MRI and CT simultaneously. The MRI and CT findings were analyzed in regard to tumor position, size, hemorrhagic, cystic or necrotic components, calcification, tumor density, signal intensity and enhancement features. Results: The age of the 12 patients ranged from 13 to 46 years (mean age: 23 years). T2WI revealed heterogeneous intensity, hyper-intensity, and slight hypo-intensity in 6 cases, 2 cases, and 1 case, respectively. On DCE-MR images, mild, moderate, and marked rim enhancement of the tumor in the corticomedullary phase (CMP) were observed in 1, 6, and 2 cases, respectively. The tumor parenchyma showed iso-attenuation (n = 4) or slight hyper-attenuation (n = 1) compared to the normal renal cortex on non-contrast CT images. Imaging findings were suggestive of hemorrhage (n = 4) or necrosis (n = 8) in the tumors, and there was evidence of calcification in 8 cases by CT (n = 3) and pathology (n = 8). On dynamic contrast-enhanced CT images, 3 cases and 1 case manifested moderate and strong CMP enhancement, respectively. Nine tumors by MRI and 4 tumors by CT showed prolonged enhancement. Three neoplasms presented at stage I, 2 at stage II, 3 at stage III, and 4 at stage IV according the 2010 AJCC staging criteria. Conclusions: XP11.2 translocation RCC should be considered when a child or young adult patient presents with a renal tumor with heterogeneous features such as hemorrhage, necrosis, cystic changes, and calcification on CT and MRI and/or is accompanied by metastatic evidence. © 2014 Wang et al.

84904580930	Renal carcinomas associated with Xp11.2 translocations/TFE3 gene fusions: Findings on MRI and computed tomography imaging	Purpose To retrospectively analyze MRI and computed tomographic (CT) findings from renal carcinomas associated with Xp11.2 translocations/TFE3 gene fusions (Xp11-RCC). Materials and Methods Institutional review board permission was obtained to review patient medical records, and the requirement for informed consent was waved. The clinical and MRI/CT features of five cases with Xp11-RCC that were confirmed by pathology were analyzed retrospectively. The image characteristics included the lesion location and size, contribution of cystic and solid components, intratumoral necrosis or hemorrhage, invasion of perinephric tissue and renal sinus, lymphadenopathy, major venous or arterial vascular invasion, pattern of the tumor growth, intratumor calcification and lipids, homogeneity of SI on T2-weighted images, attenuation and SI of the mass with respect to the normal renal cortex on precontrast and contrasted CT/MRI images, tumor SIs, tumor attenuations and tumor-to-cortex indices, homogeneity of enhancement on the contrasted images. Results The mean age was 32 years (range, 15-47 years). Most patients (4/5) were women. All tumors showed a cortical location. The average tumor size was 9 cm (range, 4-18 cm). Four tumors comprised a predominantly solid lesion with focal necrosis, and one tumor comprised a solid lesion with significant necrosis. All tumors showed intertumor hemorrhage, infiltrative growth and invasion of the perirenal adipose/renal sinus. Four cases showed retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, of which one case showed simultaneous mediastinal and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. All tumors from four cases showed mild hyperintensity on T1-weighted MRI images, and three tumors showed hypointensity on T2-weighted MRI images relative to the renal cortex except for 1 tumor that showed significant hemorrhage and a relative hyperintensity. For 3 cases who were imaged with CT, two tumors imaged using nonenhanced CT images showed mild hyperdensity relative to the renal cortex. Calcification was noted in all three tumors. All tumors showed mild, persistent enhancement. Conclusion Typical Xp11-RCC manifests as an advanced, solid renal mass with mild persistent enhancement, a prevalence of intertumor hemorrhage/calcification, and a cortical epicenter location. The predilection for children and young adults is a useful clinical feature when confirming a diagnosis of Xp11-RCC. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, in the setting of novel targeted therapies and liver directed treatments, simple tumor anatomical changes can be less informative and usually appear later than biological changes. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a potential to be a promising technique for assessment of HCC response to therapy.

The integration of upconversion nanoparticles and mesoporous silica that can combine the diagnostic/therapeutic functions within a single platform, may provide a more advanced way for the efficient theranostics of cancer. In this study, sub-80nm rattle-structured multifunctional Gd-UCNPs core/mesoporous silica shell nanotheranostics (UCMSNs) were successfully constructed for the co-delivery of a radio-/photo-sensitizer hematoporphyrin (HP) and a radiosensitizer/chemodrug docetaxel (Dtxl). Upon NIR excitation and X-ray irradiation, the complete tumor elimination has been achieved by the synergetic chemo-/radio-/photodynamic tri-modal therapy under the assistance of simultaneous magnetic/upconversion luminescent (MR/UCL) bimodal imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first example of achieving tri-modal synergetic therapy in one single nanotheranostic system, and we anticipate that it may serve as a particularly useful platform for the clinical diagnosis and efficient treatment of cancer from bench to beside. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84906082220	Extramural depth of tumor invasion at thin-section MR in rectal cancer: Associating with prognostic factors and ADC value	Purpose To assess the value of maximal extramural depth (EMD) of T3 tumor spread on MRI as a potential noninvasive imaging biomarker of tumor aggressiveness in rectal cancer, by analyzing the relationship between tumoral EMD values and clinical or histological prognostic parameters. In addition, we try to investigate the relationship between EMD and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. Materials and Methods Ninety rectal cancer patients who underwent primary MRI staging and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) as T3 tumor were included. Tumor EMD was measured, and the EMD values of the subgroups based on pretreatment CEA, CA19-9 levels, N stage, and histological parameters were compared. The correlation between EMD and ADC values was compared. Results Interobserver agreement of confidence levels for observers 1 and 2 was good for cN stage (k = 0.678) and EMD measurement(k = 0.612) and was excellent for ADC measurement (k = 0.880). Tumor EMDs differ between CEA <5 ng/mL versus ≥ 5 ng/mL (P = 0.013), CA19-9 < 27 U/mL versus ≥ 27 U/mL (P = 0.012), the groups of cN0 versus cN+ cancers (P = 0.049), and between the several groups of histological differentiation grades (P = 0.033). There was no significant difference in EMDs between the various groups of vessel carcinoma embolus and neural invasion. A significant negative correlation (r = -0.581; P = 0.001) between ADC and EMD values was found. Conclusion Significant correlations were found between EMD values and CEA, CA19-9 level, differentiation grade and ADC value. As been found, higher EMD values were associated with a more aggressive tumor profile and, therefore, EMD has the potential to become an imaging biomarker of tumor aggressiveness indicator. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
