0012186856	Tunable microwave characteristics of a superconducting planar transmission line by using a nonlinear dielectric thin film	A field solution for a planar type-II superconducting transmission line made of two high-temperature superconducting films and a nonlinear dielectric thin film is derived. The combined effects of the nonlinear dielectric permittivity as well as of vortices inside the superconductors on the attenuation constant and phase velocity are numerically investigated. Variation in temperature-dependent phase velocity due to the dielectric nonlinearity is lowered pronouncedly in the presence of vortices. In addition, variation in phase velocity versus dc electric field is also reduced in the case of more vortices. The role played by the nonlinear dielectric as well as the vortices in such a tunable microwave component are thus demonstrated. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.

0030173572	Microwave surface impedances of BCS superconducting thin films	The microwave propagation-dominated problem in the multilayer structure made of a BCS superconducting film and a dielectric substrate is investigated theoretically by using the modified two-fluid model and transmission line theory. The effective microwave surface impedances are studied as functions of temperature, frequency, and film thickness, as well as substrate thickness. Special attention is paid to the substrate resonance phenomenon in the resonant structure. The influence of BCS coherence effects on surface impedance and resonant behavior is clearly demonstrated. The resonant effect in the stack structure is well interpreted with the help of the transverse resonance technique in the microwave theory. © 1996 IEEE.

0030233087	AC permeability of the flux-line liquid in the anisotropic high-T	AC properties of the flux-line liquid in the anisotropic high-temperature superconducting crystals in a parallel field are theoretically investigated. The ac responses in the simple flux-flow regime are analyzed from associated effective ac-magnetic permeability calculated on the hydrodynamic theory basis. The responses are studied as functions of anisotropic ratio and sample dimensions. The results illustrate the influence of the platelet crystal's size on permeability in the anisotropic superconductors while in the isotropic superconductors, the relationship of responses between a square rod and cylinder is found. It indicates that the permeability of a cylinder can be essentially replaced by that of a square rod and vice versa.

The single crystals in the shapes of platelet and cylinder in parallel field configuration are considered. The microwave responses are analyzed from the associated effective r.f. magnetic permeabilities. The influence of the anisotropic resistivity on the microwave response is stressed in an anisotropic superconductor.

In the isotropic superconductor, a relationship between the responses of a square rod and a cylinder is found. The results show that the microwave properties of a cylinder can be essentially replaced by those of a square rod and vice versa. Also the geometric effect on the response is illustrated in the isotropic superconductor.

0032641996	Angular dependence of microwave transmission and reflection of type-II superconducting film in the mixed state	By using the phenomenological theory of vortex dynamics, we have extended the microwave transmission and reflection of a type-II superconducting film to a complicating case with an oblique applied static magnetic field. We have calculated the microwave transmittance and reflectance as functions of the static field's magnitude and angle Ψ relative to the normal of superconductor surface, and the angle α defined by the plane containing the surface normal and static magnetic field relative to the incident microwave field. Numerical results illustrate that the microwave properties are essentially independent of Ψ when α = 0°, and also independent of α when Ψ = 0°, respectively. Moreover, they are affected substantially as Ψ and α increase, especially at 90°.

28044450613	Photonic band structure for a superconductor-dielectric superlattice	The photonic band structure in the transversal electric mode for a one-dimensional superconductor-dielectric superlattice is theoretically calculated. By using the Abeles theory for a stratified medium, we first calculate the transmittance spectrum from which all the possible bands can be directly seen. Then we calculate the real photonic band structure based on the transcendental equation derived from the transfer matrix method and Bloch theorem. The band structure is shown to be strongly consistent with the transmittance spectrum. We finally study the three lowest band gaps as a function of penetration of superconductor, permittivity of dielectric, and angle of incidence, respectively. The optical properties in a superconductor- dielectric superlattice thus are well disclosed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Microwave response is studied via the calculations of the microwave surface impedances for three model structures in which dielectriclike superconductors are considered. Firstly, the calculated intrinsic surface impedance for a bulk material occupying the half space decreases with increasing frequency. Secondly, the calculated intrinsic surface resistance for a superconductor film of a finite thickness shows some anomalous resonance peaks. The distribution of these sharp peaks is strongly dependent on the film thickness. Discussion of these comblike peaks is also given. Finally, we calculate the effective microwave surface impedance of a superconductor/ dielectric layered system. The substrate resonance behavior in the surface resistance will be illustrated and discussed. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.

The optical reflectance and transmittance of TE and TM waves are calculated and analyzed for two model structures, a superconductor occupying the half-space and a superconducting film of finite thickness. At the oblique incidence to a free-space-superconductor interface, it is found that the Brewster angle of a TM wave is close to the grazing angle of incidence. In the transmittance spectrum for a superconducting film, a sharp comblike distribution of the resonance peaks is found. These peaks are not regularly spaced in the frequency domain. The number of peaks increases substantially with an increase in the thickness of the film. In addition, the effect of the oblique incidence on this anomalous comblike distribution in a TM wave is stronger than that of a TE wave. © 2006 Optical Society of America.

33847686307	Thickness-dependent effective surface resistances of nearly ferroelectric superconductors	The effective surface resistance of nearly ferroelectric superconducting film in the dielectriclike response is theoretically investigated based on the electrodynamics of the nearly ferroelectric superconductors. We calculate the intrinsic film surface resistance for isolated thin film and the effective surface resistance for a superconductor/dielectric layered structure. It is found that the thickness-dependent surface resistance has two different behaviors separated by a critical film thickness being equal to the London penetration length. That is, a nonresonant dependence is seen when the film thickness is less than the London penetration length, and an anomalously resonant behavior is found when the film thickness is larger than the London penetration length. The nonresonant dependence is similar to that of a cuprate superconductor and it further is characterized by some other critical thicknesses. As for the anomalous resonant region it is seen only in a nearly ferroelectric superconductor. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

34248216971	Microwave surface impedance of a nearly ferroelectric superconductor	The intrinsic microwave surface impedance for a nearly ferroelectric superconducting film of finite thickness in the dielectric-like response is theoretically investigated. It is based on the electrodynamics of a nearly ferroelectric superconductor that incorporates the Maxwell's equations, the lattice equations for an ionic lattice, and the superconducting London equation as well. It is found that the surface resistance will be enhanced with decreasing the film thickness when the thickness is less than the London penetration depth. However it will begin to resonate as a function of film thickness at the thickness being more than one London penetration depth. The anomalous resonance peaks occur when the thickness equals the even multiple of the London penetration depth. In the frequency-dependent surface resistance, the number of the resonance peaks is strongly dependent on the film thickness, increasing with increasing the thickness. In addition, these peaks are not regularly spaced at a fixed interval. Discussion on this anomaly in the surface resistance will be given.

The numerical results reveal some fundamental features about the annular mirror. It is found that the reflection response at azimuthal mode m = 0 for an annular mirror is almost identical to that of a planar mirror with the same material parameters. The dependence of reflectance spectrum on the starting radius in an annular mirror is shown to be very weak. In addition, for a higher azimuthal mode such as m = 1, the difference between the E-polarization and H-polarization can be seen. The upper wavelength bandedge will be lowered down in the H-polarization. © 2007 VSP.

38549152950	A compact-size D lens collimator for fiber coupling	The paper presents a low cost and easy to fabricate compact D lens fiber optic collimator. Both the theoretical and experimental results are presented. The beam diameter and insertion loss of the lens are theoretically analyzed by using the ABCD matrix and the overlap integral methods. The experiment results show that the smallest beam diameter is found to be in the range of 380 to 400μm as the output distance varies from 10 to 30 mm. The insertion loss of the collimator is shown to be less than 0.3 dB. This number is slightly less than the value obtained by a conventional GRIN lens of similar dimensions for 10 to 30 mm output distance operated at λ= 1550 nm.

77954563638	Effective surface impedance of a high-temperature superconducting film in semiconductor plasma substrate at mid-infrared frequency	The effective surface impedance of a high-temperature superconducting thin film on a semiconductor plasma substrate is calculated. Two possible configurations are considered. The first one is a superconducting film deposited on a semi-infinite semiconductor substrate. It is seen that there exists a critical film thickness for the superconductor such that a minimum effective surface resistance is attained. The effective surface resistance is strongly dependent on the high-frequency permittivity of semiconductor plasma. The second will be limited to the more practical case, that is, the semiconductor substrate is of finite thickness. The investigation of substrate resonance in the effective surface resistance shows some fundamental distinctions when a semiconductor plasma substrate is introduced. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

84861880606	Magnetooptical effects in wave properties for a semiconductor photonic crystal at near-infrared	We investigate the magnetooptical effects in near-infrared wave properties for a semiconductor-based photonic crystal (PC) containing n-type InSb. We find that the static magnetic field serves as an externally switching and tuning agent in the wave transmission near 1.54 μm. With the applied static magnetic field, an additional small transmission gap, which does not appear in the absence of static magnetic field, can be opened up. The position of this gap can also be further tuned by the variation in this static field. The analytical results near this wavelength reveal that such a semiconductor PC can work as a magnetically tunable notch filter, which will be informative and of technical use to signal processing in optical communications. © 2012 IEEE.

84867069998	Volumetric modulated arc therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A dosimetric comparison with TomoTherapy and step-and-shoot IMRT	Purpose: Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), a novel technique, employs a linear accelerator to conduct dynamic modulation rotation radiotherapy. The goal of this study was to compare VMAT with helical tomotherapy (HT) and step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with regard to the sparing effect on organs at risk (OARs), dosimetric quality, and efficiency of delivery. Materials and methods: Twenty patients with NPC treated by HT were re-planned by VMAT (two arcs) and IMRT (7-9 fields) for dosimetric comparison. The target area received three dose levels (70, 60, and 54 Gy) in 33 fractions using simultaneous integrated boosts technique. The Philips Pinnacle Planning System 9.0 was adopted to design VMAT, using SmartArc as the planning algorithm. For a fair comparison, the planning target volume (PTV) coverage of the 3 plans was normalized to the same level. Dosimetric comparisons between VMAT, HT, and IMRT plans were analyzed to evaluate (1) coverage, homogeneity, and conformity of PTV, (2) sparing of OARs, (3) delivery time, and (4) monitor units (MUs). Results: The VMAT, HT, and IMRT plans had similar PTV coverage with an average of 96%. There was no significant difference between VMAT and HT in homogeneity, while the homogeneity indices of VMAT (1.06) and HT (1.06) were better than IMRT plans (1.07, p < 0.05). HT plans provided a better conformity index (1.17) than VMAT (1.28, p = 0.01) and IMRT (1.36, p = 0.02). When compared with IMRT, VMAT and HT had a better sparing effect on brain stem and spinal cord (p < 0.05). The effect of parotid sparing was similar between VMAT (mean = 26.3 Gy) and HT (mean = 27.5 Gy), but better than IMRT (mean = 31.3 Gy, p < 0.01). The delivery time per fraction for VMAT (5.7 min) were much lower than for HT (9.5 min, p < 0.01) and IMRT (9.2 min, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our results indicate that VMAT provides better sparing of normal tissue, homogeneity, and conformity than IMRT, and shorter delivery time than HT. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84887447371	Defect modes properties in periodic lossy multilayer containing negative index materials with symmetric and asymmetric geometric structures	In this paper, the characteristic matrix method is used to study the propagation of electromagnetic waves through one-dimensional lossy photonic crystals composed of negative and positive refractive index material layers with symmetric and asymmetric geometric structures with a defect layer at the center of the structure. First, the positive index material defect layer is considered, and the effects of the polarization and the angle of incidence on the defect mode in the transmission spectra of the both structures are investigated. The results show that the number of the defect modes in the transmission spectra depends on the geometry (symmetric or asymmetric) of the structure. In addition, it is shown that the defect mode frequency increases as the angle of incidence increases. This property is independent of the geometry of the structure. Then, for normal incidence, the negative index material defect layer is considered, and the properties of defect modes for both structures are investigated. The results can lead to designing new types of transmission narrow filters. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

Microwave transmittance in the dielectric-like response has been calculated based on the transfer matrix method as well as the electrodynamics of NFE SCs. Microwave response is strongly dependent on the number of periods as well as the thickness of superconductor layer. It is found that the first anomalous transmission peak can be created when the number of periods is more than five. In addition, more anomalous peaks are generated by greatly increasing the number of periods. The presence of anomalous sharp peaks can be used to design a nicely frequency-selective filter or sampler using such a multilayer structure. Copyright © (2008) by the Electromagnetics Academy.

Numerical analysis shows that by introducing the open slot on the metallic blocks, there will appear extra spoof SPPs modes in the band gap of metallic solid blocks. The dispersion curve of such spoof SPPs modes passes through the light line and enters into the radiation region, and consequently it can generate a frequency steering pencil-like radiation. Experimental verification agrees with the theory.

This solution enables us to investigate the propagation characteristics in the infrared frequency region. Propagation characteristics such as the attenuation constant and the phase constant are numerically analyzed as a function of the frequency, the temperature, and the thickness of a superconductor as well. In the temperature-dependent attenuation constant, it is found that there exists a characteristic temperature at which the attenuation constant attains a maximum. This characteristic temperature decreases with increasing frequency. In addition, it is seen that both the attenuation constant and the phase constant decrease with increasing thickness of a superconducting film. Finally, numerical result in the total power flow reveals that there exists a cutoff propagation constant. Electromagnetic wave can propagate through the line when the propagation constant is greater than this cutoff value. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

The results of transmittance spectra show the existence of a cutoff frequency in such a bilayer periodic structure. Electromagnetic wave is allowed to propagate through the structure when its frequency is higher than cutoff frequency. However, it will be totally reflected at a frequency below cutoff frequency. This cutoff frequency is strongly dependent on thicknesses of the superconductor and dielectric layers, and the temperature as well.

65449148210	Extraordinary optical properties of a superconducting periodic multilayer in near-zero-permittivity operation range	Optical properties in a one-dimensional periodic multilayer structure consisting of superconducting and dielectric films are rigorously studied. Due to the temperature- and wavelength-dependent refractive index in superconducting films, the design of multiple-resonance Fabry-Perot resonators can be achievable without physically introducing any defects to break the periodicity of the structure. These extraordinary optical properties, different from the regular all-dielectric Bragg reflectors, are mainly attributed to the operation in the near-zero-permittivity range of superconductors. Additionally, while the reflection bandwidth tends to enlarge with increasing angle of incidence for transverse magnetic polarization, it remains unchanged with band edges shifted for transverse electric polarization. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

We model the chirped mirror by successively cascading a number of sub-Bragg reflectors in which the optical lengths of the two constituent dielectric layers in each sub-Bragg reflector are varied in a linear chirp manner. With the change in the chirp parameter, it is seen that the reflection bandwidth is pronouncedly enlarged due to the shift in the bandedges. In addition, a broader bandwidth can be obtained when a different chirp arrangement of structure is designed. Investigation of angle-dependent reflectance for the TE wave is also given. © 2009 VSP.

It is shown that the simultaneous peaks in reflection and transmission are strongly dependent on the polarization of the incident wave. The peak positions of the reflection and transmission are shifted to shorter wavelengths as the angle of incidence increases in both TM and TE polarization. Additionally, the reflection peak height is increased in TE polarization, whereas it is decreased in TM polarization. Two effective Brewster angles can be defined through the angle-dependent reflectance at the resonant wavelength for both polarizations. The first, for TE polarization, is found at 34°, and the second is 77° for TM polarization. The structure could thus be used as a polarizing device in addition to a filtering one. © 2009 Optical Society of America.

The two SNG materials include one with a single-negative permittivity (ε<0,μ>0) and the other with a single-negative permeability (μ<0,ε>0). It is found that the size of the bandgap and the positions of the band edges are strongly dependent on the thickness ratio of the two constituent SNG layers. First, the bandgap decreases with increase in the ratio and eventually shrinks to zero at a critical value of the ratio. Then the bandgap is opened up and enhanced when the thickness ratio is larger than the critical ratio. By using the composite right/left-hand transmission-line model, we qualitatively explained the bandgap's shifting behaviors that are due to the variation of the thickness. © 2009 Optical Society of America.

Based on the calculated transmittance spectrum, the photonic bandgaps, passbands, and the bandedges are analyzed as functions of the thicknesses of the constituents. It is shown that the band shift is primarily dominated by the thickness change of the dielectric layer and the band enhancement can be mainly controlled by the thickness change in the superconducting layer.

As in the usual Fabry-Perot filter design, the negative-index defect is sandwiched by two quarter- wave dielectric mirrors. Some useful design rules on selecting value of the negative-index of the defect have been numerically elucidated. Such narrow band transmission filtering is achieved when the refractive index of defect is either a negative even integer if the thickness is taken as a quarter of design wavelength; or a negative odd integer if the thickness is taken as a half of design wavelength.

The photonic crystal consists of two alternating SNG materials, including that one has a negative permittivity (ENG) and the other has a negative permeability (MNG). It is found that there are two types of SNG gaps. The first is the low-frequency gap which is very insensitive to the incident angle in the transversal electric (TE) wave. The second gap, which strongly relies on the incident angle for both TE and transversal magnetic (TM) waves, will close at the zero bandgap frequency at which the impedance match as well as the phase match in the constituent ENG and MNG layers must be simultaneously satisfied. This zero bandgap frequency is also strongly dependent on the incident angle. The band edges and the gap maps are investigated rigorously as a function of the incident angle and the ratio of thickness of the two SNG layers. The analyses are made in the lossless and lossy cases for both TE and TM waves. The inclusion of the loss enables us to further clarify two fundamentally distinct second SNG gaps which are separated by a threshold angle of incidence. ©2008 Optical Society of America.

We first investigate the effective surface resistance and surface reactance in the case of normal incidence. We find that there is a critical thickness for superconductor film such that a minimum loss is attained. We next study the effective surface impedance under the oblique incidence. The calculated effective surface impedance indicates that the angle-dependent feature is only seen for the single period. However, it does not rely on the number of periods when the period is greater than two and, in the meantime, the surface resistance is nearly unchanged as a function of the angle of incidence. © 2009 VSP.

The DDPC is made of alternating two high/low-index quarter-wave dielectric layers stacked periodically. A disordered DDPC is modeled by randomly changing the real thicknesses, or, the optical lengths, of the two dielectrics. In a single disorder case, where the disorder only appears in one of the two constituents, it is found the photonic band gap can be preferably enhanced for the disordered high-index layer. In the double disorder stack, in which both the constituent layers are disordered, the photonic band gap can, however, be significantly enlarged. In addition, numerical results illustrate that a flat band gap can be obtained by the use of disorder in the optical length.

Microwave properties are analyzed by the effective surface impedance calculated by using the impedance transform method. It is found that the anomalous resonant peaks in the surface resistance appearing in an NFE SC slab are greatly affected by the presence of the HTSC film. In the case where the HTSC is in front of the NFE SC, the resonant peaks are shifted to higher frequencies and the peak heights are strongly suppressed as well. However, if the HTSC is at the backside of the NFE SC, the peak heights are strongly enhanced in addition to shifting to higher frequencies. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

77949767534	Optical properties of a high-temperature superconductor operating in near zero-permittivity region	Optical properties of a high-temperature superconductor in the near-zero-permittivity operation range are theoretically investigated. Investigations are performed through the calculations of optical reflectance over three model structures. First, the calculated wavelength-dependent reflectance for a bulk superconductor occupying half-space shows that the threshold wavelength is strongly influenced by the angle of incidence and the polarization of wave. Second, the reflectance response in a single superconducting slab has a peak at the threshold wavelength for the transverse magnetic (TM) wave, whereas the shape of the peak is very sensitive to the angle of incidence. Finally, reflectance is calculated for a superconductor- dielectric bilayer structure. The results illustrate that the dielectric substrate has a pronounced effect on the reflectance response for both TM and transverse electric waves. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

It is found that the resonant peaks in the reflection and transmission spectra are shifted to shorter wavelengths as the number of periods in the PQW increases. The shifting feature is more salient if the QW is deeper, that is, the refractive index contrast in the constituents of the PQW is increased.

The filter is made of a defect layer together with two quarter-wave dielectric photonic crystals in a symmetric manner. It is found that a narrowband transmission filter can be achieved with the value of negative refractive index in defect being an even integer when the defect thickness equals the quarter wavelength. It also can be implemented when the value of negative refractive index is equal to an integer if the defect thickness is taken to be the half wavelength. As for the asymmetric one, there is only one selection rule for the quarter wavelength defect. Additionally, the effects of losses coming from the left-handed defect are also examined.

The properties are explored through the effective surface impedance calculated by using the enhanced two- fluid model for high-temperature superconductors together with the transmission line theory. The calculated effective surface impedance will be numerically analyzed as a function of the frequency, the temperature, and the thicknesses of the constituent layers. It is found that, for a thinner superconducting film, the effective surface resistance is a strong function of the frequency, and the effective surface reactance exhibits a peak and a dip in the frequency-domain. In the study of the effect of thickness in ferromagnetic substrate, there is a peak frequency in the surface reactance for a thinner substrate. There is also a threshold thickness for the ferromagnetic substrate such that it behaves like a bulk substrate when its thickness is larger than this threshold value. In the temperature dependence of surface reactance, the peak near critical temperature is shifted to lower temperature and broadened as the film thickness decreases.

Numerical analysis of micro-strips made of silver-tin (Ag-Sn) alloy, or good conducting niobium (Nb) films reveals the surface resistances behaving as nearly a one-half power law dependence on the frequency, which is in congruence with the results derived from the free-electron model in simple metals. In addition, we have specifically investigated the electron transport with a strong localization effect on the DC temperature-dependent resistivity in abnormal and normal Nb films. The results indicate a deviation from a one-half power law may occur in the abnormal film. This work can be further exploited to measure the conductivity and penetration depth of metals in multilayered structure or of superconducting films.

Useful design guidelines in selecting positive parameters for the resonant tunneling are obtained. We also investigate the possible influence in the resonant tunneling due to the losses from the ENG and MNG materials. Additionally, we examine the polarization-dependent resonant tunneling, that is, the dependence of angle of incidence is examined.

This study is to establish a practical method to modify the CBCT for accurate dose calculation in head and neck cancer. Patients and Methods: Fan-beam CT (FBCT) and Elekta's CBCT were used to acquire images. The CT numbers for different materials on CBCT were mathematically modified to match them with FBCT. Three phantoms were scanned by FBCT and CBCT for image uniformity, spatial resolution, and CT numbers, and to compare the dose distribution from orthogonal beams. A Rando phantom was scanned and planned with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Finally, two nasopharyngeal cancer patients treated with IMRT had their CBCT image sets calculated for dose comparison. Results: With 360° acquisition of CBCT and high-resolution reconstruction, the uniformity of CT number distribution was improved and the otherwise large variations for background and high-density materials were reduced significantly. The dose difference between FBCT and CBCT was < 2% in phantoms. In the Rando phantom and the patients, the dose-volume histograms were similar. The corresponding isodose curves covering ≥ 90% of prescribed dose on FBCT and CBCT were close to each other (within 2 mm). Most dosimetric differences were from the setup errors related to the interval changes in body shape and tumor response. Conclusion: The specific CBCT acquisition, reconstruction, and CT number modification can generate accurate dose calculation for the potential use in adaptive radiotherapy. © 2011 Urban & Vogel.

The reflection spectrum is further shown to be strongly dependent on the azimuthal number. In addition, the PBG is greatly enhanced as the azimuthal number increases. The PBG structure is periodically distributed at odd multiples of design frequency for m = 0, which is consistent with the PPC.

The location of high In-content InGaN layer in staggered QWs considerably affects the distribution of the electrostatic-field of an LED. When the high In-content InGaN layer is suitably located in the staggered QWs, the localized electrostatic-field with high intensity increases the transport efficiency of injected holes across the active region, improving the overall radiative efficiency of the LED. Most importantly, as accumulation of injected holes in the last QW is relieved, the Auger recombination process is quenched, suppressing the efficiency-droop in the LED. Theoretically, the incorporation of the staggered InGaN QWs in the green LED (λ = 530 nm) can ensure an extremely low efficiency droop of 11.3%. © 2011 VSP.

This study was aimed to correct the reconstructed volume losses of moving phantoms by phase-specific CBCT. Materials and methods: Planning fan-beam CT (FBCT) of five hepatobiliary/gastrointestinal/pancreatic cancer patients were acquired under active breathing control and compared with free-breathing CBCT for kidney volumes. Three different-sized ball phantoms were scanned by FBCT and CBCT. Images were imported to a planning system to compare the reconstructed volumes. The phantoms were moved longitudinally on an oscillator with different amplitudes/frequencies. The phase-specific projections of CBCT for moving phantoms were selected for volume reconstruction. Results: The differences in reconstructed volumes of static small, medium, large phantoms between FBCT and CBCT were -∈6.7%, -∈2.3%, and -∈2.0%, respectively. With amplitudes of 7.5-20 mm and frequencies of 8-16 oscillations/min, volume losses on CBCT were comparable with FBCT in large moving phantoms (range 9.1-27.2%). Amplitudes were more subject to volume losses than frequencies. On phase-specific CBCT, volume losses were reduced to 2.3-6.5% by reconstruction using 2-3 projections at end/midoscillation phase. Conclusion: Amplitude had more impact than frequency on volume losses of moving phantoms on CBCT. Phase-specific CBCT reduced volume losses. © 2011 Urban & Vogel.

Here, a strongly extrinsic semiconductor, n-type germanium nGe, is used as one of the constituent layers. The occurrence of multichannel feature originates from the negative-permittivity in the highly doped nGe. The existence of tunable feature is due to its concentration-dependent permittivity. It is of interest to find that, in such MCFs, the number of channels, i.e., the number of resonant transmission peaks, is directly related to the stack number, and these peaks are located within the pass band of the ideal host PC. The multiple channels are blueshifted as the impurity concentration increases. This design suggests an alternative of engineering the pass band for realizing an MCF instead of engineering photonic band gap in a PC containing photonic quantum well structure as a defect.

We consider two possible schemes that can be used to enhance the PBG in the near-infrared region. The first scheme is to add an ultrathin metal layer into the DS PC such that a structure of ternary metal-dielectric-semiconductor (MDS) PC is formed. The second scheme is to make use of the heterostructured PC. In scheme 1, it is found that the addition of metal layer will significantly move the left band edge to the shorter wavelength position, leading to an enlargement in the PBG. This enlargement can be extended as the thickness of metal film is increased. In addition, a pronounced enhancement in PBG is achieved when the metal with a higher plasma frequency is used. In scheme 2, we find that the PBG can be significantly enlarged compared to scheme 1. In addition, the increase in the band extension is shown to be four times larger than that in scheme 1. The results illustrate that, in order to enhance the PBG, the use of scheme 2 is superior to scheme 1. The enhancement of nearinfrared (NIR) PBG is of technical use in the optical communications.

The temperature dependence is studied by simultaneously incorporating thermal expansion and thermal-optical effects in the constituent layers. As the thickness and index of refraction of each layer are modulated by temperature, a tunable filter working in the visible region is proposed. The shift of transmittance peak per 100 °C is around 2 nm, depending on the value of m, which is the stack number of the PQW and ranges between 1 and 3 in our study. It is found that the third transmittance peak in the case of m = 3 is most sensitive to temperature (2.43 nm per 100 °C), whereas the second transmittance peak of m = 3 is the sharpest. The bias dependence is studied by considering the electro-optic effect of the defected layer. The shifts of transmittance peaks are found to be in the range of 0.129 ∼ 0.188 nm per 1 kV of applied voltage. Additionally, the second transmittance peak of m = 3 is most sensitive to voltage, and it is also the sharpest peak.

With the derived formulae, we present the numerical results for three model structures such as the single cylindrical interface, the single cylindrical slab, and the cylindrical photonic crystal (CPC). In the single cylindrical interface, it is found that there exists a Brewster starting radius at which a minimum reflectance is attained in H-polarization. In the single cylindrical slab, the result illustrates that the reflectance response in the wavelength domain contains the oscillating and nonoscillating regions.

It is found that such a photonic crystal can function as a multichannel transmission filter with a channel number equal to N-1. The required condition is that the thickness of MNG layer must be larger than that of ENG layer when magnetic plasma frequency is greater than electric plasma frequency. The channel frequencies can be red-shifted as the thickness of MNG layer decreases. The channel positions can be tuned by the incidence angle for both TE and TM polarizations. That is, the peak frequency is blue-shifted when the angle of incidence increases. Additionally, the influence of the static permeability of ENG medium and permittivity of MNG medium is also illustrated.

84875734570	Effect of nanostructured architecture on the enhanced optical absorption in silicon thin-film solar cells	We apply the finite-difference time-domain method to numerically calculate the enhanced optical absorption of three nanostructures (i.e. nanorod, nanocone, and nanolens arrays) that were decorated on the surface of 2 μm thick crystal silicon (Si) thin-films. Compared with the nanorod and nanocone arrays, the nanolens array exhibits the highest power conversion efficiency. This result is mainly attributed to the natural capability of the nanolens array to optically couple incident light into in-plane guided modes, which increases the optical path of the incident photons in the long-wavelength regime. The power conversion efficiencies of the optimized nanorod, nanocone, and nanolens arrays are η = 17.4, 18.8, and 22.0%, respectively. These efficiencies correspond to enhancements of 26.1, 36.2, and 59.4% for the nanorod, nanocone, and nanolens arrays, respectively, compared with a planar Si thin-film with a standard quarter-wavelength antireflection layer. These findings show promises for the nanostructured design of Si thin-film solar cells that exhibit enhanced optical absorption. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

84877936963	Numerical study of effective plasma frequency for a plasma photonic crystal in the presence of magnetic field	In this paper, based on the transmittance spectrum calculated by making use of the transfer matrix method, we numerically study the effective plasma frequency for a ternary plasma photonic crystal (PPC) in the presence of static magnetic field. The results illustrate that the effective plasma frequency for the PPC will be red-shifted as a function of the static magnetic field. In the case of oblique incidence, we find that the effective plasma frequency is found to be insensitive to the angle of incidence in the TM wave. Copyright © 2013 The Electromagnetics Academy.

84877982006	Experimental verification of the suppression of crosstalk between bended parallel microstrips via designer surface plasmon polaritons	Abstract| In this paper, we propose a novel microstrip using the concept of designer surface plasmon polaritons (designer SPPs) to construct the bended parallel microstrips to suppress the crosstalk in between, which is realized by introducing subwavelength periodic corrugations onto the edges of one conventional microstrip. The transmission properties of this microstrip are numerically analyzed. The suppression effect of the coupling between the bended corrugated microstrip and conventional microstrip is also experimentally investigated, especially in the time domain signal measurement. A good agreement between the numerical and experimental results in this microstrip structure is found. Thus, such a structure can effectively suppress the cross talk in the high speed digital signal transmission. Copyright © 2013 The Electromagnetics Academy.

84878565480	Analysis of tuning in a photonic crystal multichannel filter containing coupled defects	We investigate the tuning properties in a photonic crystal multichannel filter made of coupled defects. The tuning in defect modes is achieved by the temperature change as well as the applied bias voltage. The temperature tuning arises from the thermal expansion and thermal-optical effects in the constituent layers. It is found that the resonant peaks are red-shifted as the temperature increases. In the voltage tuning, the defect modes are blue-shifted as the positive bias is applied, whereas they are red-shifted when the bias voltage is negative. The position of peak wavelength is further shown to linearly decrease with the applied voltage. The analysis of tunable features reveals that such a multichannel filter can be used not only a tunable device but a temperature- or voltage sensor. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

It is found that, in the oblique incidence, such a kind of photonic crystal exhibits additional photonic bands or dips in the vicinity of either magnetic plasma frequency or electric plasma frequency. The additional photonic bands or dips corresponding to magnetic plasma frequency occur only for the TE wave, whereas those corresponding to electric plasma frequency occur only for the TM wave. In addition, we find that there exist omnidiretional gaps in such a singlenegative FSPC. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84887076532	Superior liver sparing by combined coplanar/noncoplanar volumetric-modulated arc therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: A planning and feasibility study	Compared with step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiotherapy (sIMRT) and tomotherapy, volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) allows additional arc configurations in treatment planning and noncoplanar (NC) delivery. This study was first to compare VMAT planning with sIMRT planning, and the second to evaluate the toxicity of coplanar (C)/NC-VMAT treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Fifteen patients with HCC (7 with left-lobe and 8 with right-lobe tumors) were planned with C-VMAT, C/NC-VMAT, and sIMRT. The median total dose was 49Gy (range: 40 to 56Gy), whereas the median fractional dose was 3.5Gy (range: 3 to 8Gy).

0039654506	High-frequency vortex response of anisotropic type-II superconductors	The theory of the self-consistent treatment of vortex dynamics developed by Coffey and Clem is extended to the case of anisotropic type-II superconductors. The vortex response to a microwave electromagnetic field is theoretically investigated based on the associated complex rf magnetic permeability of anisotropic superconductors. Microwave dissipation due to vortex motion is studied as a function of the temperature, dc magnetic field, and microwave frequency. Comparisons of numerical results between anisotropic and isotropic superconductors are also given. The influence of the thin edge of superconducting platelets on the microwave properties is specifically examined as well. The extension presented provides the possible applicability in studying the high-frequency response of real anisotropic high-temperature superconducting single-crystal platelets in the mixed state.

0345419054	Device modeling of ferroelectric memory field-effect transistor for the application of ferroelectric random access memory	An improved theoretical analysis on the electrical characteristics of ferroelectric memory field-effect transistor (FeMFET) is given. First, we propose a new analytical expression for the polarization versus electric field (P-E) for the ferroelectric material. It is determined by one parameter and explicitly includes both the saturated and nonsaturated hysteresis loops. Using this expression, we then examine the operational properties for two practical devices such as the metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MFIS-FET) and metal-ferroelectric-metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MFMIS-FET) as well. A double integral also has been used, in order to include the possible effects due to the nonuniform field and charge distribution along the channel of the device, to calculate the drain current of FeMFET. By using the relevant material parameters close to the (Bi, La)

84890078299	Resonant transmission in a dielectric photonic crystal with a thin metallic coating	In this work, the resonant optical transmission (ROT) in a dielectric-dielectric photonic crystal (DDPC) with a thin metallic coating operating in the visible is theoretically investigated. First, the phenomenon of ROT is shown to occur at the frequency within the photonic band gap (PBG). To obtain a significant ROT, there is an optimum stack number for the DDPC and an optimum thickness of thin metal layer. The phenomenon of ROT can be explained by the condition of impedance matching. Second, the effect of different metallic films on the ROT is also examined. It is found that the frequency of ROT is blue-shifted for the metal with a larger plasma frequency. Finally, the behavior of ROT is investigated as a function of angle of incidence for both TE and TM waves. The frequency of ROT is blue-shifted as the angle of incidence increases for TE and TM waves. In TM wave, it is of interest to find that there are two ROTs within the photonic band gaps. The analysis made is based on the use of the transfer matrix method.

84888181622	Analysis of effective plasma frequency in a magnetized extrinsic photonic crystal	The effective plasma frequency (EPF) in an extrinsic photonic crystal is theoretically analyzed. The extrinsic PC is a single homogeneous doped semiconductor (n-GaAs) that is influenced by an externally and periodically applied magnetic field. Based on the calculated photonic band structure, we investigate the magnetic-field dependence of EPF. The results reveal that the EPF will be smaller in the absence of the magnetic field and lowered down when the magnetic field increases. The EPF is shown to be a decreasing function of the filling factor of the magnetized region. Additionally, investigation of the first passband and band gap is also given. The study illustrates that such an extrinsic PC possesses tunable optical properties that are of technical use in semiconductor photonic applications. © 2009-2012 IEEE.

84888286241	Properties of the defect modes in 1D lossy photonic crystals containing two types of negative-index-material defects	In this paper, the characteristic matrix method is employed to theoretically investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves through one-dimensional defective lossy photonic crystals composed of negative-index materials (NIMs) and positive-index materials. We consider symmetric and asymmetric geometric structures with two different types of NIM defect layers at the center of the structure. The effects of polarization and the angle of incidence on the defect modes in the transmission spectra of both the structures are investigated. The results show that the number of the defect modes within the photonic band gap depends on the type of the NIM defect layer and is independent of the geometrical structure. Moreover, it is shown that the defect mode frequency increases as the angle of incidence increases. This property is also independent of the geometry of the structure. The results can lead to designing new types of narrowband and multichannel transmission filters. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

84898808227	Propagation characteristics of a nonlinear tm surface wave in a parallel plate superconductor/antiferromagnet waveguide	Nonlinear surface wave propagation properties for a symmetric planar antiferro-magnet/superconductor/antiferromagnet waveguide are theoretically investigated. The attenuation constant and the phase constant, in the infrared frequency region, are numerically analyzed as a function of the thickness of superconductor. It is seen that both the attenuation constant and the phase constant decrease with increasing the thickness of superconducting film. In addition, numerical result in the total power flow reveals the existence of a threshold value in the propagation constant. Electromagnetic wave can propagate in the waveguide when propagation constant is greater than this threshold value.

84901702992	Microwave surface impedance of a nearly ferroelectric superconductor	The intrinsic microwave surface impedance for a nearly ferroelectric superconducting film of finite thickness in the dielectric-like response is theoretically investigated. It is based on the electrodynamics of a nearly ferroelectric superconductor that incorporates the Maxwell's equations, the lattice equations for an ionic lattice, and the superconducting London equation as well. It is found that the surface resistance will be enhanced with decreasing the film thickness when the thickness is less than the London penetration depth. However it will begin to resonate as a function of film thickness at the thickness being more than one London penetration depth. The anomalous resonance peaks occur when the thickness equals the even multiple of the London penetration depth. In the frequency-dependent surface resistance, the number of the resonance peaks is strongly dependent on the film thickness, increasing with increasing the thickness. In addition, these peaks are not regularly spaced at a fixed interval. Discussion on this anomaly in the surface resistance will be given.

The numerical results reveal some fundamental features about the annular mirror. It is found that the reflection response at azimuthal mode m = 0 for an annular mirror is almost identical to that of a planar mirror with the same material parameters. The dependence of reflectance spectrum on the starting radius in an annular mirror is shown to be very weak. In addition, for a higher azimuthal mode such as m = 1, the difference between the E-polarization and H-polarization can be seen. The upper wavelength bandedge will be lowered down in the H-polarization.

In this work, based on the use of n-doped GaAs as a constituent of photonic quantum well, the filter can be tunable, i.e., it can be tuned by the hydrostatic pressure and the temperature. It is found that there is a critical pressure at which a minimum peak frequency occurs. Above or below this critical pressure, the peak frequency will be blue-shifted. As for the temperature effect, we find that the peak frequency is red-shifted as the temperature increases. This tunable multichannel filter is of technical use in semiconductor optoelectronics. The analysis is done from the transmission spectra calculated by using the transfer matrix method. © 2014 JSAP.

84907211304	Thickness-dependent transmission in a finite photonic crystal containing nearly ferroelectric superconductor	In this paper, anomalous transmission properties in a finite photonic crystal made of a nearly ferroelectric superconductor, and a dielectric have been theoretically investigated. We show that, in the thickness domain, the transmission spectrum can be divided into two different regions: nonresonance and resonance. There are resonant transmission peaks in the resonance region, and the number of peaks is strongly dependent on the number of periods. In the frequency response, the number of resonant peaks is also increased as the thickness of nearly ferroelectric superconductor increases. The appearance of anomalous peaks enables us to design a narrowband filter without introducing any defect layer into the photonic crystal.

For such spoof SPPs, there exists an additional guiding mode except for the fundamental mode and the former is closely related to hollowing out metal blocks. The dispersion band of this additional mode has a negative slope (corresponding to a group velocity) and it intersects the light line and then enters the radiation region as the frequency grows, which leads to a frequency steering pencil-like radiation. The transmission and radiation properties of the additional mode of spoof SPPs are finally verified experimentally.

The dispersion relation and field distribution of those lines are analyzed numerically. And then through designing practical coupling circuits, we found that compared with conventional differential microstrip lines, the electromagnetic field can be strongly confined inside the grooves of the corrugated microstrip lines, sothe crosstalk between the differential pair and the adjacent microstrip lines is greatly reduced, and the conversion from the differential signal to the common mode signal can also be effectively suppressed. The propagation length of those lines is also very long in a wide band. Moreover, the experimental results in time domain demonstrate those lines perform very well in high-speed circuit. Therefore, those novel kinds of spoof SPPs based differential microstrip lines can be widely utilized in high-density microwave circuits and guarantee signal integrity in high-speed systems.

This algorithm prevents the possibility of stagnation in the iteration process and achieves fast convergence for global optimisation. The efficiency of the immune algorithm to solve the problem is verified by comparing the computing time of the conventional binary integer programming for decision making of the switching operation. An interactive best-compromise method is also applied to solve the multiobjective distribution-feeder reconfiguration. Quantitative measures can be supplied to aid the decision-making process. A Taipower distribution system with 18 feeders is selected for computer simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for solving the optimal-switching operation of distribution systems to minimise the power loss and simultaneously enhance the loading balance.
