Investigation and study show that the discrepant deformation after construction between the existing subgrade and the one to be widened is the main reason. Through studies on computation models of asphalt pavement construction response to uncoordinated deformation, we figure out the increasing stress of each pavement layer. Under the indoor large scale test, the resilient modulus of pavement and its fatigue life are reduced respectively.

2942581084	Distress characteristics and mechanism in road widening engineering	When the width of a road is insufficient to meet current National Highway Standards or the need of increased traffic loading, it will be widened. But some facility distresses often appear in road widening engineering, especially the pavement distresses near the position of existing-widening subgrades integration. Several existing widened roads in Chongqing and Shanghai were chosen to investigate the facility distresses in road widening engineering.

33845455368	Material characterizations with seismic technology	Mechanistic design procedure specified in the proposed NCHRP (National Cooperative Highway Research Program) 1-37A Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide requires measurements of resilient modulus, stiffness, strength of pavement materials as parts of the design inputs. Currently, the tests specified to measure all these properties defined by AASHTO are time and labor intensive. Moreover, they require very expensive testing equipment and highly trained operators. The need for reliable, fast, cost-effective and nondestructive evaluation of pavement material properties becomes ever more important. Seismic techniques are used to test all these properties, which is based on generation of elastic waves and measurement of their propagation velocity and various wave propagation properties. The techniques have been successfully used in characterization of sites and pavements by the spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) method, evaluation of pavements with seismic pavement analyzer (SPA) and portable seismic pavement analyzer (PSPA).

33845516416	Reliability index analysis of internal stability of reinforced embankment	In order to perfect the reliability design method of reinforced embankment, Monte-Carlo method was adopted to analyze the relations between the design parametric random variables and internal stability reliability index of reinforced embankment. Analysis result indicates that the internal stability is better when the density is lower, and the parameters, such as the cohesion, internal friction angle, geosynthetics tensile strength and pseudo-friction coefficient, are larger. The internal stability reliability index is sensitive to the variation coefficients of the design parameters. Except the internal friction angle, other different probabilistic models of the design parametric random variables and the design loads of different highway classes have little influence on the internal stability. Perhaps the internal stability is improved while light filler with high cohesion and big internal friction angle and high strength geosynthetics are used in the reliability design. The reliability tend to be safe while filler density accords with extremal type I largest distribution, the cohesion, internal friction angle, geosynthetics tensile strength and pseudo-friction coefficient accord with normal distribution.

Method laboratory evaluation of fatigue performance of AC20, SBR-AC20 and RM-AC20 is focused on the indirect tensile fatigue testing. Based on the elastic fatigue damage mechanics, the suited evolvement function of fatigue cracking is present and relative parameters are regressed according to the results of indirect tensile fatigue testing. At the same time the finite element method is used to assess the fatigue performance of the three different kinds of asphalt mixtures. Result the same fatigue evolvement tendency of the three different kinds of asphalt mixtures is found, however, the different fatigue features are obvious owing to the different material parameters.

34547619200	Failure mechanism and design criterion for low-volume roads subgrade widening	During the past decade, a large number of low-volume roads have been rebuilt in China to accommodate a sharp increase in traffic volume. An in situ investigation of highway reconstruction found cracking, a pattern typical of deterioration in pavements related to subgrade widening. The cracking is caused by the development of differential deformations between the widened subgrade and the existing subgrade. On the basis of finite element analysis and full-scale simulation laboratory tests, characteristics of subgrade differential deformation and its impact on pavement performance were studied. For typical asphalt pavements with a semirigid base course, three kinds of cracking modes related to subgrade widening were noted: shear cracking, bottom-up cracking under wheel loads, and top-down cracking induced by subgrade differential deformations. Finally, on the basis of the sensitivity of pavement cracking to change in horizontal slope, a design criterion for pavement subgrade widening was proposed.

The implicit time integration scheme of Newmark is used to produce a more reliable calculation process and usually a more accurate solution. The influences of reinforced embankment design parameters, such as reinforcement-soil interface property, reinforcement elastic axial stiffness, reinforcement placed position and placed type are discussed. The reinforced embankment is inclined to shear slip between the reinforcement and the surrounding soil interface under horizontal earthquake loading. The high axial stiffness reinforcement should be placed near the top of embankment and the embankment reinforced near double side slopes has more advantages to resist the earthquake.

Based on the test data, the level and distribution of pile-soil stress were analyzed; and the pile-soil stress ratios calculated with different methods were studied. The results indicate that pile-stress concentration effects are related to the embankment height and the sites of piles. Pile-stress concentration effects can be found if the height of embankment constructed with soil mixed with fly ash and lime is larger than 120 cm; and they will not be encountered under the embankment slope near slope-foot. The pile-stress concentration effects of the piles in the middle of composite foundation are greater than those of the piles at the range of composite foundation. The bearing capacity of soils under the pile-cap works only when pile-stress concentration effects are great; and the difference between the stresses on the caps and those under the caps all indicate that the soils under the caps are nearly separated from the caps. Pile-soil stress will be adjusted continuously during embankment construction; and the observed pile-soil stress ratios range from 1 to 12. The observed pile-soil stress ratios can not correctly reflect the stress characteristics of composite foundation with sparse T-shaped rigid piles under widening embankment; and it is suggested that pile-stress concentration effects should be evaluated with pile-site stress ratio.

Through numerical calculation and influence factor analysis of the cumulative plastic deformation, the mechanism that the reinforcement can reduce the residual deformation of the subgrade was investigated. Analysis result shows that the reinforcement can improve the vertical compressive stress distribution, and decrease the shear stress on the surface of the subgrade of graded-broken-stone-based asphalt concrete pavement. The deviator stress on the upper 80cm part of the reinforced subgrade is reduced distinctively, which is one of the key factors that can lead to cumulative plastic deformation. On the other hand, the main cumulative plastic deformation is formed in the upper 100cm part of the subgrade under traffic loading. Therefore, the main reason for the decrease of cumulative plastic deformation of a reinforced subgrade is that the reinforcement can diminish the deviator stress on the upper part of the subgrade induced by traffic loading. The deviator stress would decrease with the increase of the stiffness of geogrid.

A case study is made on the application of the model with real data. The comparison results show that: The impact of pavement types, environmental factors, traffic loading, and other relevant factors can be directly considered and a non-homogeneous transition probability matrix, which varies with time and yield better predictions, is derived by using mixed logistic model. Unobserved heterogeneity which comes from measurement errors and unobserved factors across different individual pavement sections is captured by random effects, and then bias and inconsistency of estimates are reduced to an acceptable small level. Different individual pavement transition probability, which can be used to predict a given pavement performance, is obtained by estimating random effects parameters in the mixed logistic model, especially when the size of the data set is insufficient or work of modeling individuals is heavy, inefficient traditional approach cannot provide unbiased, consistent, and efficient model estimators.

According to the above FEM model, the numerical solution of pile-surrounding pressure and horizontal displacement under the condition of actual layered soils were studied. The numerical results indicate that the horizontal displacement in the elastic region around the pile is only influenced slightly by the depth and property of soils; the expansion pressure in the same soils increases with depth as a whole and, near the interface of soft and hard soils, decreases significantly when the pile tip approaching the bottom of hard soils, and increase significantly when the pile tip approach the bottom of soft soils. Compared the above numerical solution with the analytical solution with cavity expansion method under plane strain condition, it is found that the horizontal displacement in the elastic region of shallow buried soils with analytical method is bigger than that with numerical method, and the pile-surrounding pressure with analytical method is much smaller than that with numerical method.

56349130909	Shanghai's experience on utilizing the rubblization for jointed concrete pavement rehabilitation	As agencies continue looking for cost-effective methods to rehabilitate deteriorated jointed concrete pavement (JCP), rubblization using a resonant breaker has been experimented by the Shanghai Municipal Roadway Authority (SMRA). It was demonstrated that rubblization using a resonant breaker offers a viable option for the SMRA because the rubblized pavement sections have been performing very well with no visible distress. Based on field observation for a typical hot mix asphalt concrete (HMAC) overlay on a nonrubblized JCP, it was found the treatment normally would have reflective cracking for the same overlay thickness in the first three years. Besides the cost advantage over the reconstruction, a resonant breaker also had yielded the minimum disturbance during the rubblization. It was observed that it was very effective to use water during compaction on a rubblized JCP surface to improve compaction efficiency and to control dust. Furthermore, there is no need to apply a prime coat before the HMAC overlay, as there was no detrimental effect that could be identified. The average rubblized JCP moduli were found to be 1,323 to 1,375 MPa, which are within the range reported in the literature. It was believed that there were high possibilities to increase rubblized JCP moduli without sacrificing the performance by increasing the particle size, because a reduction of 200 mm of HMAC was observed when rubblized JCP increased from 345 to 3,445 MPa at a subgrade modulus of 138 MPa and traffic of 30 million ESAL. However, further research is needed to optimize the rubblized JCP moduli in an attempt to reduce overlay thickness without creating reflective cracking. © 2008 ASCE.

62749186036	3-D finite element analysis of the load transfer efficiency of joints of airport rigid pavement	Based on the ABAQUS software, a 3-D finite element model to analyze the structural response and load transfer efficiency (LTE) of the jointed rigid airport pavement was established by distributing the stiffness to the nodes along the joint using the concept of contributing areas. Behavior of the joint was evaluated in detail with respect to load levels, structural parameters, as well as under multiple wheel loads. The results indicate that LTE is independent of load levels. Slab thickness and joint stiffness have more significant effect on LTE than base layer thickness, contact condition between slab and base, and subgrade strength. Furthermore, under multiple wheel loads, the stress response of the loaded side of the joint is almost the same as under single load, while on the unloaded side of the joint it is affected by the interaction of multiple wheel loads. Stress transfer for various landing gears approaches or exceeds 0.25, and shear load transfer decreases with an increase in axes of landing gear.

The improved method of back calculation which integrates the respective strongpoint of deflection basin area method and best-fit method was proposed. In the improved method, deflection basin area method was used to determine the range of radii of relative stiffness rather than the value of radii of relative stiffness directly, and the best-fit method was adopted according to criterion of fitting accuracy error between measured deflection basin and calculated deflection basin. Results show that the improved method combines advantage of deflection basin area parameters back calculation method with advantage of best-fit method which makes full use of information supplied by sensors of field measurement deflection basin; regarded fitting deflection error as judgement criterion, multi-solution problem of back calculation result was solved.

In order to reflect the reinforcing mechanism and effect of composite ground of pre-stressed pipe piles applied for highway embankment widening, the deformation characteristics of the composite ground was investigated by field test-dynamic monitoring of settlement, differential settlement, deep settlement, and lateral movement. The results showed that: (1) The composite ground reduced 80% of the natural settlement, and effectively controlled the differential settlement between new and old embankments, to meet the design requirements.(2) Settlement and lateral movement of the composite ground were very small, and converged quickly, and thus could meet the requirement of short construction periods.

70350145699	Finite element model of airport rigid pavement structure based on ABAQUS	Based on ABAQUS software, the stress and deflection convergences of a slab with four free edges resting on Winkler foundation were analyzed. Appropriate continuum element type, mesh fineness and plane dimension for finite element model of jointed rigid pavement were studied. According to the concept of contributing areas, the stiffnesses of nodes along joint were distributed, and spring elements were set at corresponding points of abutting concrete boards to simulate force transfer among concrete boards. A comprehensive 3D finite element model to analyze the structural response of rigid pavement system was developed and verified. The transfer coefficients of joint loads for the model and a regress model were compared. Comparison result indicates that in the finite element model, second-order element C3D27 or C3D27R is most appropriate when considering interlayer contact. Relevant element dimensions should not exceed half of slab thickness. The maximum plane size of the model should be four times of relative stiffness radius. The element SPRING2 can be adopted to simulate the load transfer of joints in which stiffness are distributed to nodes based on their contributing areas. 4 tabs, 14 figs, 9 refs.

76749084270	Discussion of coverage for airport asphalt pavement design	Coverage is an important parameter in the airport pavement design. Coverage calculating method in CBR pavement design method of FAA and UFC are detailed. In those methods the load repetitions can be considered using pass-to-coverage ratio. The ration is calculated base on the wheel-path distribution on pavement surface, which is not corresponding to the damage caused by the stress or strain within pavement depth. The calculating position is moved from surface to the top of subgrade in LEDFAA 1.3, while the lateral distribution of strain is considered as uniform not a normal distribution. There are no specific definitions of coverage in the specifications for asphalt concrete pavement design in China. For a pavement design method which can satisfy the New Generation Large Aircraft, such as A380, the coverage should be considered base on pavement spatial responses. The general pavement design concept advanced by Monismith gives a good idea to develop coverage calculation method. © 2008 ASCE.

77950409214	3D finite element analysis of geosynthetic-reinforced and pile-supported widening of embankment over soft soil	To minimize the differential deformation between the widening subgrade and the existing one, geosynthetic-reinforced and pile-supported (GRPS) embankment was chosen as a typical geotechnical composite system in Shanghai A11 expressway-widening engineering. Due to the complexity of this problem, 3D finite element analysis was conducted to investigate the mechanical behavior and effect of GRPS embankment in subgrade-widening engineering over soft soil. Analysis results indicate that, GRPS embankment can reduce differential settlement and enhance the stability significantly, spacing of outer piles can be larger than that of the inner piles, and the installation of piles under the existing embankment slope combined with excavation of old filling is very necessary when the height of embankment is not less than 3 meters. © 2009 ASCE.

77953029958	Analysis on stress level of subgrade under cement concrete pavement	Factors affecting the stress level of subgrade were investigated through systemic parameter analysis, and then a 3D finite element model was established and used for load stress analysis. For typical cement concrete pavement structure, the stress of subgrade was calculated under all kinds of gear weights and configurations. Analysis result indicates that the subgrade workaround is deepened and the stress level in the region is raised with the increasing of the gear weight and the number of axis. The stress induced by multi-axis was overlapped in the deep-seated subgrade. The stress state of subgrade was calculated by adding the at-rest pressure to the load stress which was computed by finite element analysis. The statistical result of stress state illustrates that the maximum and minimum principal stress range in 30~70 kPa and 10~40 kPa respectively, and the principal stress ration is fluctuated between 1.9 and 6.0. The magnitude of stress in subgrade is increased by 10 kPa when the applied load enhances from 100 kN to 200 kN, which impacts the mechanical behavior of subgrade dramatically. Thus, it is needed to consider the stress-dependent behavior of subgrade in pavement design.

77956102881	Study on pavement superposition effects under multiple aircraft tires	Superposition effects of runway asphalt pavement under multiple aircraft tires load are discussed in this paper. 30×20×10 m (Full Size Model), 15×20×10 m (1/2 Model) and 15×15×10m (1/4 Model) size models are established on ABAQUS 3D numerical analysis platform. Using those models, asphalt pavement responses under single tire, double tires, single tandem, dual tandem, dual triple, and compound landing gear are studied. Results show that multiple superposition effects are apparent. The pavement surface deflection under full landing gear is larger than any other tire groups; the maximum vertical strain on the top of the sub-grade and the horizontal stress at the bottom of the base appear in 6 tires group for A 380 and rear 8 tires group for B-777; the largest strain or stress can reach 1.15 times of the full landing gear's value. Based on the pavement responses under multiple tires load, the fatigue life of pavement is analyzed. Functions developed by LEDFAA, APSDSR and UC Berkeley are used in the fatigue analysis. The results of flexible and semi-rigid pavements show that the allowed load repetitions of runway asphalt pavement under full landing gear are 20∼30% higher than 6 or 4 tires group. Therefore, the full landing gear is recommended to be used in asphalt pavement structure design. © 2010 ASCE.

77956112148	In-situ testing and evaluation of moisture content in existing sub-grade	The bearing capacity of subgrade soils, which is a critical parameter for assessing pavement conditions and guiding the type and extent of maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R), is greatly influenced by soil water content. In this study, a case of long-term spatial distribution of moisture content in existing cohesive subgrade in Shanghai was investigated. The in-situ testing data revealed significant variations in the water content of the sub-asphalt soils layers in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The equilibrium moisture contents (EMC) beneath pavement were calculated based on unsaturated soil theory and Fredlund & Xing equation was chosen as the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC). Comparison of water content estimates from investigation and from prediction shows that, the relative elevation of groundwater table (GWT) is an influential factor controlling moisture distribution in subgrade, but areas with high water content immediately beneath pavement mainly reflect the inefficacy of pavement drainage systems. © 2010 ASCE.

77958088146	Finite element analysis of Cymbal piezoelectric transducers for harvesting energy from asphalt pavement	The purpose of this paper is to design a Cymbal for harvesting energy from asphalt pavement. Asphalt pavement is used popular on road. Part of the energies in the pavement caused by vehicle and gravity can be harvested by piezoelectric transducers. Cymbal is selected to harvest energy from asphalt pavement because of its low cost, high reliability and reasonable efficiency. The efficiency and coupling effects with pavement of Cymbals with various sizes are discussed through finite element analysis (FEA). The displacement difference at pavement surface between with and without Cymbal is developed to considering the coupling effects. The results show that the potential electric energy harvested from pavement increases with the diameter of Cymbal. However, the efficiency decreases with the increasing of Cymbal size. The diameter at 32mm is suggested as the size of Cymbal. The potential electric energy increases near linearly with the diameter of end cap cavity base. Enough bonding area should be left to bond the end steel cap and PZT. There is a maximum electric energy existing when the top diameter of the end steel cap changes. The maximum electric energy is generated when the thickness of cap steel is about 0.3 mm. There is also a maximum electric energy existing when the height of end cap cavity changes. The Cymbals with thicker PZT can generate higher electric potential and storage electric energy. Considering the storage electric energy, cost, bonding between end steel cap and PZT and the pavement surface displacement, the Cymbal with 32mm of total diameter, 22mm of cavity base diameter, 10mm of end cap top diameter, 0.3mm of cap steel thickness, 2 mm of cavity height and 2mm of PZT thickness is suggested as the optimum one for harvesting energy from asphalt pavement. The electric potential is about 97.33V of the design Cymbal. 0.06J electric energy can be storage in that Cymbal. Its potential maximum output power is about 1.2mW at 20Hz vehicle load frequency. © 2010 The Ceramic Society of Japan. All rights reserved.

Based on stress response analysis and deformation response analysis, the mechanism of the decrease of cumulative plastic deformation of soil foundation by geogrid reinforcement was investigated. Analysis result shows that the cumulative plastic deformation of soil foundation with about 1 m embankment thickness develops rapidly under traffic loading. Geogrid reinforcement can improve maximal compressive stress distribution, and decrease shear stress on the surface of soil foundation. Geogrid reinforcement can diminish dynamic deviator stress on the upper part of soil foundation induced by traffic loading, with the result that it decreases the cumulative plastic deformation of soil foundation obviously. The cumulative plastic deformation decreases distinctly with the increase of the embankment thickness, and the effect of reinforcement is descending accordingly.

79955962344	Influence of embankment thickness and reinforcement on cumulative plastic deformation of soft soil foundation	Soft soil foundation under traffic loading was modelled by implicit dynamic finite element method (FEM). Based on numerical model, calculation and influential factor analysis of cumulative plastic deformation, a study was made of the influence of the thickness of embankment on cumulative plastic deformation induced by traffic loading. Then, from the standpoint of distribution of dynamic deviator stress of soil foundation underneath the center of loading area, an investigation was made into the meaning and mechanism that reinforcement could decrease cumulative plastic deformation of soil foundation. Analysis result shows that the cumulative plastic deformation of soil foundation with about 1 m thickness embankment develops rapidly under traffic loading. The cumulative plastic deformation decreases distinctly with the increasing of the thickness of embankment. As for soft soil foundation which is influenced significantly by traffic loading, geogrid reinforcement can improve vertical stress distribution, and decrease shear stress on the surface of soil foundation. The main reason of the decrease of cumulative plastic deformation of reinforced soil foundation is that reinforcement can diminish deviator stress on the upper part of it induced by traffic loading.

A simplified concept based on stress/strain spread angle and equivalent width is put forward as the basis of load repletion calculation. The results based on double pavement layers analysis show that the equivalent width is the function of top layer thickness and relative stiffness of the layers. Then, the simplified equations for calculating equivalent width are put forward. The width differences between simplified method and spatial response-based method are within 5%. The pavement with more than two layers can be transferred to two layers according the equivalent approach. With the equivalent width, load repetition methods are developed for single tire, and a detailed analysis is made of the multiple tires and multiple axles as well. Furthermore, the equations with a consideration of the mixed traffic are put forward.

80053126835	Study on harvesting energy from pavement based on piezoelectric effects	This paper presents the initial research results of harvesting energy from asphalt pavement based on piezoelectric effects. There are two mechanical energies existing in pavement: stress and vibration driven energy. Approximately 0.664 J of work is done by a standard axle load at a speed of 60 km/h in a depth of 40 mm on asphalt pavement. A vibration frequency of 15 Hz is measured in the field of asphalt pavement. A 254 V of potential is measured from the cymbal array in the initial laboratory test conducted under a 0.7 MPa 20 Hz half-sine load. The results verify the feasibility of harvesting energy from the pavement. The performance of the transducers is related to the energy converting efficiency, storage ability, fatigue life, and the stiffness matching level with the pavement. The energy converting efficiency of the transducers is approximately 5%~30% on asphalt pavement. The electric potential is approximately 97.33 V of the design Cymbal with a diameter of 32 mm. The maximum output power is approximately 1.2 mW at a vehicle load of 20 Hz.

The results show that sample unit size has little effect on PCI accuracy, and as long as the unit size is within 20±5 slabs, the error is about 1 point. Altering unit shape leads to significant difference of section PCI value, therefore units dividing cannot be altered arbitrarily. PCI value calculated by horizontal units is lower relatively, but it is more conservative for management. The effect of severity deviation of a single main distress due to manual data collection on section PCI is insignificant, and the error is limited to about 2 points, however, the average error reaches up to 10 points if severity degrees of all distress are deviated.

The tensile stress in the surface increases significant when the braking force exceeds 0.5 times of the single wheel load. The interface condition between surface and base affects the semi-rigid pavement more. When the contact coefficient between surface and base exceeds 0.5, influence for the maximum shear stress in the surface and the tensile stress at the bottom of surface is not significant.

Track I was designed with a shallow 1.5m fine sand subgrade and Track II was designed with a medium 3.0m fine sand subgrade. The two tracks were constructed using traditional procedures on the natural clay subgrade covered with a layer of graded macadam. The asphalt pavements consisted of three asphalt layers (total 200 mm) and two cement-treated aggregate layers (total 540 mm, with 5% cement). The top 600mm to 800mm of the subgrade was treated with 3 to 4% cement. Track I was subjected to 1 million load applications at elevated temperature for 15 days and 1.1 million load applicationswere applied onTrack II at ambient air temperature for 17 days. Profile and temperature datawere collected. Pavement profiles and diagnostic excavation indicated that pavement deformation originated from compression and shear flow of the asphalt materials. No fatigue cracking was observed. The influence of the fine sand subgrade and its depth on pavement rutting was negligible. Cores and pit surveys showed that the top asphalt layer of 120mm thickness was significantly affected by trafficked loading and temperature. The rate of rutting and total deformation volume of asphalt at high temperature was 1.5 times that of the test at ambient air temperature during early trafficking, about three times more thereafter. The rate of deformation on Track I was almost twice as fast as that ofTrack II. It is concluded that thick asphalt pavement with cement- treated-aggregate base will have good rutting resistance and can be expected to be a perpetual structure. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.

Behavior of the pipe vertical soil pressure, lateral earth pressure and pipe stress were evaluated in detail with respect to varied foundation treatment. And the behavior of the top soils difference settlement was evaluated by layer-wise summation and finite element method(FEM). The results indicate that the max soil pressure on pipe top, bottom and side of pipe occurs when vehicle load is on the top. The Mises stress, which can reach up to 4.887 MPa, can't be neglected. Layer-wise summation can't be calculated precisely for the soil pressure concentration phenomenon caused by pipeclay relative stiffness is not taken into consideration. And the problem can be solved by a combination of FEM with layer-wise summation method.

84880673403	Influence of moisture content change cyclicity on modulus evolution law of cohesive subgrade soil	After experiencing a repeated dry-wet cycle, the mechanical properties of the subgrade soil show irreversible changes. An indoor test was carried out to investigate the influence of the moisture content changes cyclicity on resilience modulus of the cohesive subgrade soil. And the extent of the resilience modulus attenuation of subgrade result in frequently dry-wet cycle was analyzed. A series of humidity cycle such as "water seepage under the permeable stone-standing-oven dehydration" were repeated to imitate the scene of the subgrade soil moisture content fluctuation process. The resilience of subgrade soil was tested by the system of UTM. The results show that the moisture content changes cyclicity influences the resilience modulus of cohesive subgrade soil. The resilience modulus decreases against the increase of cycle times. On the same stress state, the higher the equilibrium moisture content is, the more sensitive the resilience modulus changes are. As a result, the resilience modulus tends to be unstable.

84883471541	Analysis on additional stress for apron oil pipe under external loads	To analyze the structural response of oil pipe under external loads, the interaction between oil pipe and its surrounding soil was simulated based on ABAQUS software, and the finite element models for apron oil pipe were established and verified. By applying the finite element models, the research presented the characteristics of additional stress distribution, and the structural stress and deformation of oil pipe varied with its buried depth induced by external loads including aircraft load, construction vehicle load and vibratory roller load respectively. The results indicate the additional stress distribution appears to be parabola curve in the range from the pipe top to the 60° side of pipe, and the additional stress values are distinct with different buried depths of the pipe. The structural stress and deformation of the oil pipe induced by aircraft load and construction vehicle load are far less than its allowable values, even if the buried depth approximates to its diameter, while the structural stress and deformation of the pipe induced by vibratory roller load reach strength failure criteria of pipe material, and the vibratory roller load is the most disadvantageous load type and has significant impact on the buried depth of the oil pipe.

84884783013	A review of harvesting green energy from road	This paper presents a review of harvesting green energy from road23. There are three forms of green energy exist in road: light, thermal and mechanical energy. Photovoltaic technology, thermoelectric technology, directly heat transferring and piezoelectric technology are discussed in this paper, as well as the cases studied in Europe, USA, Japan, Israel and China. Solar panels installed along road are current available to harvest light energy from the roadside land. Alternatively, the solar panels can be installed on the road instead of pavement structures, such as the Solar Roadway™. This technology is rather conceptual at this moment, and the main challenge is to design and build durable materials and structures that can withstand traffic at a reasonable maintenance and replacement cost. Thermoelectric generators can potentially be embedded in pavements, and generate electric power from the temperature gradient existing in pavements. However, instrument capable of efficiently generate electricity from the relatively small temperature gradient in pavement is still under development. Directly heat transfer solution is to have fluid flow through pavement, and the fluid is heated (in summer) by the pavement. An extra benefit in addition to energy collection is that this method can reduce pavement temperature as well as the associated negative effects on pavement performance and the environment. However how the heated fluid can be utilized was not clear. Electricity can be generated by piezoelectric ceramic generators embedded in pavement, as a result of the compressive stress and deformation induced by moving vehicles. Trials have been reported in Israel and China, and it was estimated that one lane-mile of highway can potentially general electricity of 200 kW. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84884808072	Performance and utilization of recycled aggregates for airport cement concrete pavement	Cement concrete of airport pavement can be crushed into aggregates for recycle using, and the performance and utilizations of the recycled aggregates were discussed and researched herein. Sieve analysis indicated that the concrete should be crushed many times till the percentage of critical size (31.5mm) can satisfy the gradation requirements. Due to loss of crystal water, the density and water absorption of recycled aggregates were different from the natural ones, so that an empirical corretion equation was addressed subsequently. When the recycled aggregates used in the stablized base, there's no avilable method could yield the optimum water content, therefore a series of compaction and compression tests were employed to set up a modified design method. The results indicated the shrinkage property of recycled aggregates were susceptible to the moisture, either the skeleton-dense material structure and limiting the fine aggregates content were possible ways to eliminate the sensitivity. 7-day unconfined compressive strength results proved the recycled aggregates were suitble for the base course of heavy duty highways and airfield in grade E/F as well. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84890023518	Methods in detecting typical embankment defects during operation period	Subgrade is required to be stable enough to provide a reliable bearing capacity during operation time. Excessive deformation caused by instability usually leads to pavement damages, especially for high embankments, soft soil embankments, and seasonal frozen soil embankments. In Ji Lin Province, a deformation monitoring project is obtaining real-time data, reflecting stability of embankments during operation time. Through a simple analysis of data, it provides a way to investigate the defects of the structure, which can be adopted as a basis of a maintenance planning. The problem of in-situ monitoring during operation period is data remote transmission. In dealing with the problem, a Data Auto-collection and Remote Transmission System (DARTS) has been built in Song Yuan Highway Monitoring Project. And GPR has been considered as a significant method in detecting unequal settlement defects, including soil freezing, soil loosing, and soil disengaging. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

84891547279	In-situ investigation of subgrade moisture of expressway in humid zone	In order to obtain the distribution characterization and influence factors of subgrade moisture in humid zone, four expressways were investigated by coring method or time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes. The results indicate that, the groundwater table is a main factor affecting moisture distribution in clayey subgrade beneath pavement, the equilibrium gravimetric water content is about 5% higher than optimum water content; the infiltration through the uncovered shoulder and slope can increase the subgrade moisture under the outer lane, and result in the wetting and drying cycles; the poor drainability of unpaved median also leads to the water accumulation under the inner lane; the sandy subgrade is less influenced by groundwater, and the lag between rainfall and subgrade moisture variation is shorter. So, the durability of drainage facilities should be taken into consideration in highway design, and the material parameters should be selected based on equilibrium moisture content determined by underground water, especially on the actual moisture content beneath the outer lane.

The reduction ratio of fatigue life under overweight load was suggested as the index to evaluate the reduction of fatigue life. Based on data of seven roads collected in Shanghai, the fatigue lives of every pavement under different axle loads were computed. The results indicate that the reduction of fatigue life is in an extent of 45%-50% under 25% overweight load condition, and in an extent of 85%-88% under 100% overweight load condition.

84892421067	Concrete pavement rehabilitation procedure using resonant rubblization technology and mechanical-empirical based overlay design	Reflective cracking distresses frequently occur on the hot mix asphalt (HMA) overlay due to the movements of the underlying Portland cement concrete (PCC). Rubblization was proven in North America to be an effective approach among slab fracturing technologies for solving the premature reflective cracking problem. This paper presents the procedure of applying the rubblization technology in HMA overlay design in a research effort in China to develop the Chinese standard. In the study, the validity of rubblization was analyzed by a trench survey and sieve tests; the layer moduli of the composite subgrade and rubblized concrete slab were determined using FWD and plate bearing tests and a conversion chart; the thickness design for the HMA overlay over the rubblized PCC pavement was conducted using a Chinese version mechanistic-empirical design process; and finally the in-service monitoring over the pavements built using the developed procedure was conducted to test the validity of the procedure.

84893679171	Study of index and criterion for settlement control applicable to cut-and-fill subgrade in mountain-highway	To avoid pavement structure failure induced by subgrade settlement, index and criterion for settlement control applicable to cut-and-fill subgrade for mountain-highways are studied. Firstly, the Prony series expressions for three-dimensional Merchant model are deduced based on constant Poisson's ratio hypothesis; and the settlement calculation models of cut-and-fill subgrade were established with ABAQUS. The calculations indicate that post-construction settlement curves of cut-and-fill subgrade are spoon-shaped or S-shaped. The difference in curve shape reveals the time-space coupling effect in subgrade settlement. Secondly, the following hypothesis is proposed based on post-construction settlement mechanisms: the post-construction settlement curves of cut-and-fill subgrade are central symmetric S-shaped curves composed of two parabolic segments. The mechanical response of asphalt pavement under parabolic subgrade settlement indicates that the additional flexural-tensile stress is linear with quadratic term coefficient of parabolic equation which, consequently, can be adopted as settlement control index applicable to cut-and-fill subgrade. Finally, the method of defining settlement control criterion applicable to cut-and-fill subgrade is presented based on the failure modes of asphalt pavement under traffic load and subgrade settlement. The research findings provide a technical foundation for post-construction settlement control of cut-and-fill subgrade.

84900454999	Engineering properties and treatment of hydraulically reclaimed saline soil in coastal area	In order to meet the material demand of subgrade filling in the South Yellow Sea coastal area, where the soils are mainly from the hydraulic reclamation of land from the sea, a lot of laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the engineering properties such as salinity content, particle composition, limited water content, compaction characteristic, capillary water characteristic, resilient modulus, California Bearing Ratio (CBR), shear strength and so on. It turns out that the groundwater table is only 0.4~0.6m beneath the surface and this kind of hydraulic fill is chlorine saline soil with about 0.6%~0.7% salinity. The resilient modulus is about 38Mpa and CBR is only 2% at 96% degree of compaction with the optimum water content of 17.5%, which cannot satisfy the requirement of the current specifications of subgrade design because of the high groundwater. Lime and lime with cement are used to treat this chlorine saline soil respectively and the unconfined compressive strength shows that the 6% lime treated soil can be used in the roadbed of the subgrade while the 4% lime with 4% cement treated soil is comparatively good, resilient modulus and CBR of treated soil are significantly improved to 1180Mpa and 96% at 28 days age so that it can be used in the base layer. In conclusion, this kind of hydraulically reclaimed saline soil can be taken as the subgrade and base layer filling after treatment. © 2014 IEEE.

84902374395	Study on the performance deterioration of asphalt overlays on rigid runway pavement-case study at shanghai hongqiao international airport	This paper analyzed the deterioration of performance of runway 18L-36R in three aspects: firstly, Pavement Condition Index (PCI) had been investigated since 2000 and the changes in dominant damage was analyzed. The results showed that there was a downward trend of PCI with a significant increase in length and quantity of reflective cracks. Secondly, the deflection basins from 2005 to 2009 were collected for comparison based on Heavy Weight Deflectometer (HWD) data (test date: 2005.11\2006.03\2006.08\2008.05\2009.10). And then the structural remaining life and Pavement Classification Number (PCN) were computed and analyzed based on the back-calculated results of structural parameters. It was found that there was little changes in PCN, but a significant reduction in structural remaining life. Thirdly, experimental results of core samples of asphalt overlay (2005.10\2008.05\2009.10) indicated that all the technical indexes of upper surface of asphalt overlays (overlaid in 2005) met the requirements, while the aging was more serious than other asphalt overlays (overlaid in 1991 and 1998 respectively). Moreover, the layer bonding condition between overlays and PCC changed from total bond to partial bond. Further analysis presented that material properties of overlay and bonding condition between overlays and PCC were main factors which influence the stress level in asphalt overlays and pavement bearing capacity. In conclusion, the performance of composite pavement deteriorated mainly for the property degradation of asphalt overlays. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

84903266198	Analysis of track critical velocity and track vibration under tram loading	Track vibration of a tramway in operation was theoretically analyzed. The relationships of critical velocity with elastic modulus of subgrade and thickness of track beds were obtained by solving vibration equation. It was shown that the critical velocity was greater than the design speed of trams. Another vibration differential equation was established to analyze track vibration. Both equations adopted moving impact load and ignored the impact of damping, but irregularities of rails were considered in the second equation. The analytical solutions of vibration deflection and acceleration were deduced. Based on the solutions and superposition principle, the dynamic responses under single axle loading and tram loading were analyzed. The results indicate that: (1) vibration deflection increases exponentially with irregularities amplitude; and (2) vibration acceleration has a negative logarithmic correlation with irregularity amplitude. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

84903291744	Laboratory research on resilient modulus of lime-stabilized soil	Subgrade soils are important materials to support highways. For the past few decades, the resilient modulus (MR) has been used for characterizing the stress-strain behavior of subgrades subjected to repeated vehicle loadings. Actually, instead of natural soils, lime-stabilized soils were applied widely to improve subgrade performance in wetting areas; but, MR of lime-stabilized soil was not investigated sufficiently. In this paper, to estimate the influence of stress state, moisture content and compaction energy on MR, specimens were compacted at different water contents (wopt and wopt±3%) with relative compaction of 90, 94 and 96%. Then, a series of repeated triaxial tests was carried out with confining pressures of 15, 30, 45 and 60 kPa, and deviator stresses of 60, 75, 95 and 125 kPa. Finally, results were fit to the three-parameter model recommended in NCHRP1-28A to determine the k1-3 coefficients. It was found that the predicted regression coefficients compared well with measured ones. © ASCE 2014.

The results show that, on the cross section of road, subgrade permanent deformation could described as a down concave curve in the form of a basin. the maximum value of subgrade permanent deformation and its appear position was consistent with its traffic transverse distribution form. Each sublayer permanent deformation at different depth in the subgrade internal was uniform decline while depth increased. Attenuation of subgrade modulus of resilience caused stress (strain) increase in the same position in subgrade internal.

To investigate the effect of the application of geogrid-reinforced embankment, some bridge-approaches in Shanghai Outer-ring Road engineering were chosen to test. It is shown that settlement and the earth pressure on the top of the foundation decreases greatly after using geogrid-reinforced embankment, and the settlement after construction on the road surface also becomes quite small. The result indicates that the use of geogrid-reinforced embankment could reduce the bumping at the bridge-head distinctly.
