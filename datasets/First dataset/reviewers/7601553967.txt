15044364285	Rheology of coal-water paste	Based on the experimental analyses, the slip phenomenon of coal-water paste (CWP) flowing in pipes is investigated by tube flow test in different tubes. The origination mechanism and flowing regulation of slip phenomenon in pipes are analyzed and a method of determining the real rheological models of CWP by correcting the influence of slip flow phenomenon is put forward. All kinds of CWPs behave as the properties of non-Newtonian Herschel-Bulkley fluids in the experimental range. At a certain particle size distribution the apparent viscosity of CWP increases with the increase of solid concentration. Fluidity of coal-water paste increases with increase of desulphurization additives under same concentration and particle size distribution. The optimum mass ratio of coarse coal powders to the fines in CWP for PFBC is determined. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

14344249399	Performance prediction for a cyclone separator with an added vertical pipe at its bottom	To cope with the problem of the re-entrainment into the hopper of fine dust particles in an inner vortex flow due to the agitation of separated particles occurring in conventional cyclone separators, some researchers have proposed the adding of a straight pipe at the bottom of the separator, thereby allowing dust-laden air to enter the pipe for further separation. By using a Reynolds Stress Transportation Model (RSTM) a numerical simulation was conducted of the internal gas-phase flow field in a conventional cyclone separator and in a cyclone separator with an added straight pipe at its bottom. Furthermore, an analysis was performed of the downward flow at the cone bottom of the conventional cyclone separator. The results of the analysis indicate that the gas flow eddying at the cone bottom of the conventional cyclone separator is found to be still very intense and its downward flow does not amount to zero. On the other hand, the cyclone separator with an added straight pipe has made its tail vortex stagnating in the straight pipe. This has led to the provision of an additional separation space for ash dust, creating a favorable condition for its further separation.

The test results demonstrate the feasibility of the gasifier which can provide suitable fuel gas and residual char for downstream system of second generation pressurized fluidized bed combined cycle (2G PFBC-CC).

15744372539	Pore structure of gasified coal-char	The coal-chars derived from atmosphere and pressurized partial gasification processes were measured by nitrogen adsorption principle at 77 K. Specific surface areas were determined based on BET model. Average pore size, total pore volume, pore specific surface area and pore size distribution were statistically obtained by using BJH theory. The results show that more abundant pores and larger specific areas and pore volumes are formed after partial gasification. Two peaks are found in distribution curves of the coal char pore specific surface area and pore volume; the first peak corresponds to a pore diameter of less than 2 nm, the second of about 3.8 nm. Gasification at elevated pressure can largely accelerate the pore formation. The pore development of coal-char at elevated pressure is more rapid than that at atmosphere condition.

Based on this, separation efficiencies and pressure drops of these cyclone separators were studied. Separation performances under different conditions were presented, and the predicted separation performances were compared with those from presented empirical models and experimental data. The results indicate: for cyclone separator with the diameter of 305 mm, the calculated separation efficiency from Earth empirical model is in good agreement with the experimental data, and for cyclone separator with diameter of 152 mm, the Iozia and Leith empirical model can accurately calculate its separation efficiency. The calculated pressure drops from Cacal and Martinez and Dirgo empirical model are in good agreement with the experimental data. On the other hand, the predicted separation efficiencies are in agreement with the experimental data for both cyclone separators by and large, and the error of predicted pressure drop is less than 5%.

Due to high-density atomization spray, wide size distribution and large-scale experimental setup in CWP experiments, a commercial PIV system is updated with a 600-mm-long focal length camera and a convex lens used with a laser beam. This long focal length camera makes the PIV system capable of taking the images of micro particles. The measured minimum diameter is about 15 μm. The convex lens has the benefit of centralizing the sector laser beam of the PIV system, so that the measurement window of the high density CWP field sectored by the laser beam is brighter and the images taken by the camera are clearer. The experimental results show that it is a useful and efficient tool for the PIV technique to measure the atomization prosperities of CWP.

Two Chinese coals, Hanqiao bituminous and Yuanquan anthracite, were used in four size fractions. The experimental results show that coal pyrolysis at elevated pressure occurs in two stages. In the first stage pressure has almost no effect on product yields; in the second stage it has an obvious effect whereas the temperature effect can be negligible.

Eight Chinese coals and three chars were used in four size fractions. The criterion for ignition is discussed and a new one is suggested to deduce whether the mechanism is homogeneous or heterogeneous. The influence of different factors, such as total pressure, oxygen partial pressure, particle size, heating rate, and volatile content, is studied. The ignition temperature decreases when the total pressure is increased in gas of constant composition. However, with the same oxygen partial pressure, the ignition temperature increases with total pressure. Changing the particle size, heating rate, and volatile content has the same effect at atmospheric and elevated pressures. It is suggested that the ignition mechanism may shift from homogeneous to heterogeneous at high pressures.

Shannon entropy analysis of differential pressure fluctuations was developed to characterize the dynamic behavior. Effects of two important operating parameters (spouting gas velocity and fluidizing gas flow rate) on the Shannon entropy were examined. It was demonstrated that a spout-fluid bed at a high spouting gas velocity or fluidizing gas flow rate was a deterministic chaos system since the Shannon entropies at all bed locations increased sharply and asymmetric unstable flows occurred. Shannon entropies were found to be significantly different at various bed locations. Shannon entropies of different flow regimes were distinct, so they were used to identify the flow regimes. The results show that the Shannon entropy helps to grasp the complex characteristics of dynamic behavior in spout-fluid beds. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this numerical model, the gas-solid two-way coupling effects and inter-particle collisions are taken into account.

Depending on the calculated results of gas-solid flow in the convergent gas-solid injector, it is found that the driving gas can bring a relatively steady jet region in the center of the gas-solid injector and many particles are accumulated in a certain region. According to this solid accumulation phenomenon, this present paper proposes an improved measure for the physical design of the convergent gas-solid injector.

In this paper the analyses of technical, thermal and economic performance for system were carried out under different parameters, including reasonable dust remover inlet temperature, alkali metal concentration in gas before it entering gas turbine and cooling condition in gas turbine combustor. The thermal performance and power-production cost were also studied within the range of reasonable parameters. The results show that the flue gas temperature ≤ 973K at the inlet of hot filter can satisfy the conventional industry-use gas turbine requirement on the alkali metal content and dust content in flue gas. The net efficiency of this system can reach 43.3-44.6% with sub-critical steam parameter condition and 45-46.1% with supercritical steam parameter condition. With the increasing of steam parameters, the net efficiency of this system can be increased more.

The collision of particles was modeled by soft-sphere model. The flow patterns, forces acting on particles, particle mean velocities, gas turbulent intensities and particle turbulent intensities under the typical operating conditions were obtained. The results show that the ratio of collision between particles increases with the increase of spouting gas velocity but decreases with the increase of particle size, while the ratio of collision between particles and wall is found no variation with spouting gas velocity and particle size. Gravitational force, drag force and contact force dominate the particle motion, while shear lift force and Magnus lift acting on the particles are negligible when the particles are not in the boundary of the spout region. The gas turbulent intensity is always two or three times stronger than the particle turbulent intensity, while they are both smaller near the wall.

The tests results indicated that the gas heating value was increased by 23% when the gasifying agent preheated temperature increased from 300°C to 700°C due to the decrease of the concentration of nitrogen in the gas.

The results show that a sharp rise in static pressure occurs at the inlet of the convergent section of the gas-solid injector. The static pressure in the gas-solid injector will decrease with an increase in the gas nozzle distance S and increase with an increase of the convergent angle α. It is found that with an increase in the gas nozzle outlet speed the maximum static pressure in the gas-solid injector will shift from near the inlet of the injector convergent section to a location near the outlet of the injector convergent section. In addition, the impact of the gas nozzle location, the convergent angle of the convergent section and the conveying air on the static pressure distribution in the convergent type gas-solid injector is correlated to the back pressure of the pneumatic conveying system.

One was injected into the spouting gas flow and the other was injected into the fluidizing gas flow. Steady-state tracer gas measurements were carried out to obtained radial tracer gas concentrations at various bed elevations. Effects of two important operating parameters-spouting gas velocity and fluidizing gas flow rate - on the gas mixing were discussed with flow patterns recorded by a high-resolution digital CCD camera. The results show that increasing spouting gas velocity and fluidizing gas flow rate can both promote the gas mixing in spout-fluid beds. Increasing fluidizing gas flow rate is the more effective way, given that a satisfactory mixing condition at a relatively low bed height can be obtained by increasing the fluidizing gas flow rate. For both cases, it is difficult to obtain a good mixing condition in the wall layers. Besides, the mechanism of gas mixing was preliminarily discussed. Results indicate that gas mixing in the spout-fluid bed is caused by both convection and diffusion. Diffusion other than molecular diffusion should not be neglected, especially at high spouting gas velocity or fluidizing gas flow rate. © 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

For the operation conditions studied, the results show that gasification temperature is the most important factor influencing coal gasification in the spout-fluid bed. The gasifier performance is improved at elevated pressure mainly due to the better fluidization in the reactor.

These separation models of conventional cylinder-on-cone cyclones do not consider the effect of the dust collection system on the flow field. In actual fact, the inclusion of the dust collection system had a considerable effect on the flow pattern in the gas cyclone as well as on the separation efficiency. In this paper, an extended model is presented, which is based on the time-of-flight approach. In this model, the gas residence time is modified so that the entire cyclone geometry is used. The lift force of a particle in the boundary layer is considered because of the larger velocity gradient here. The availability of the extended model is verified by comparison of the calculated grade efficiency with experimental data and theoretical counterparts in the literature. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Six distinct flow patterns, i.e. internal jet, spouting, fluidizing, jet in fluidized bed with bubbling, jet in fluidized bed with slugging and spout-fluidizing were identified. Criteria as well as schematic diagrams and typical flow pattern images obtained by a high-resolution digital CCD camera were presented for classifying these flow patterns. Typical flow pattern maps were plotted for describing the transitions between flow patterns with operating conditions. In addition, two kinds of flow instabilities were observed. Based on the flow pattern images recorded by the digital CCD camera, the mechanism of flow instabilities was preliminarily discussed. It was found that the flow instabilities are caused by stochastic visible large bubbles in the boundary of spout jet and near the fluidizing gas distributor. The growth of surface disturbances might exacerbate these flow instabilities. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effect of instantaneous turbulence on particle tracking was taken into account by means of the stochastic tracking approach and the two-way coupling between gas and solid was considered. The velocity and turbulent kinetic energy profiles of the cyclone separators were presented. The result indicates that the gas eddy in the dustbin of conventional cyclone separator is still intense. On the other hand, the cyclone separator attached a vertical tube makes the end of the vortex locate in the vertical tube, which can avoid the re-entrainment of already separated dust effectively. Additionally, the prolonged vertical tube can increase the separation space of dust, and experiment shows that the prolonged vertical tube can improve the separation efficiency by a slightly increased pressure drop. However, for an even longer tube, the separation efficiency is slightly reduced. Thus, there is an optimal tube length for a given cyclone separator.

Results indicate that the pressure loss and the separation efficiency both decrease with rising temperature and that the numerically calculated values are in better agreement with experimental data than those obtained with empirical models.

33746754748	Effects of the prolonged vertical tube on the separation performance of a cyclone	This article aims at the gas flow into the dustbin of conventional cyclones, the prolonged cyclone (attaching a vertical tube at the bottom of the dust outlet) is proposed by some researchers, which can make flow with dust enter into the tube and separate further. The Reynolds stress transport model (RSTM) has been employed to predict the gas flow fields of the conventional and prolonged cyclones. The tangential velocity, axial velocity profiles and turbulent kinetic energy profiles are presented, and the downward flow rates into the dustbin of the three cyclones are compared. The separation performances of these three cyclones are tested. The result indicates that the tangential velocity, axial velocity and turbulent kinetic energy in the dustbin reduce greatly when the prolonged vertical tube attaching into the dust outlet, which can avoid the re-entrainment of already separated dust effectively. Furthermore, the prolonged vertical tube increases the separation space of dusts. The downward flow rate into the dustbin of the prolonged cyclone decreases compared with the conventional cyclone. The experimental results show that the prolonged vertical tube can improve the separation efficiency by a slightly increased pressure drop. However, for an even longer tube, the separation efficiency is slightly reduced. Thus, there is an optimal tube length for a given cyclone. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33749998171	Maximum spoutable bed height of spout-fluid bed	Experimental study on the maximum spoutable bed height of a spout-fluid bed (cross-section of 0.3 m × 0.03 m and height of 2 m) packed with Geldart group D particles has been carried out. The effects of particle size, spout nozzle size and fluidizing gas flow rate on the maximum spoutable bed height were studied. Experimental data were compared to some published experiments and predictions. The results show that the maximum spoutable bed height of spout-fluid bed decreases with increasing particle size and spout nozzle size, which appears the same trend to that of spouted beds. The increasing of fluidizing gas flow rate leads to a sharply decrease in the maximum spoutable bed height. The existent correlations of the maximum spoutable bed height in the literature were observed to involve large discrepancies. Additionally, the flow characteristics when bed materials deeper than the maximum spoutable height were summarized. Under this condition, the spout-fluid bed operated without a stable and coherent spout or fountain assembles the characteristics of jetting fluidized bed. Besides, the mechanisms of spout termination were investigated. It was found that slugging in the spout and growth of instabilities would cause the spout termination in spout-fluid bed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Temperature distribution of tubeskin, temperature distribution of pyrolysis material and yields of products were obtained and compared with those of olefin plant. The results showed that gradients of radial velocity and temperature were larger due to viscous sublayer near the wall of reactor tube. Cracking reaction process could be fully described by two-dimensional model.

33750703192	Three-dimensional Simulation of Gas/Solid Flow in Spout-fluid Beds with Kinetic Theory of Granular Flow1 1 Supported by the National Key Program of Basic Research in China (No.2004CB217702, No.2005CB221202, No.2006CB 20030201) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.20590367, No.50676021, No.50606006).	A three-dimensional Eulerian multiphase model, with closure law according to the kinetic theory of granular flow, was used to study the gas/solid flow behaviors in spout-fluid beds. The influences of the coefficient of restitution due to non-ideal particle collisions on the simulated results were tested. It is demonstrated that the simulated result is strongly affected by the coefficient of restitution. Comparison of simulations with experiments in a small spout-fluid bed showed that an appropriate coefficient of restitution of 0.93 was necessary to simulate the flow characteristics in an underdesigned large size of spout-fluid bed coal gasifier with diameter of 1m and height of 6m. The internal jet and gas/solid flow patterns at different operating conditions were obtained. The simulations show that an optimal gas/solid flow pattern for coal gasification is found when the spouting gas flow rate is equal to the fluidizing gas flow rate and the total of them is two and a half times the minimum fluidizing gas flow rate. Besides, the radial distributions of particle velocity and gas velocity show similar tendencies; the radial distributions of particle phase pressure due to particle collisions and the particle pseudo-temperature corresponding to the macroscopic kinetic energy of the random particle motion also show similar tendencies. These indicate that both gas drag force and particle collisions dominate the movement of particles. © 2006 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC) and Chemical Industry Press (CIP).

33751424485	Experiment study on coal gasification in pressurized spout-fluid bed	Xuzhou bituminous coal was partly gasified using mixture of air and steam gasifying agent in a 0.1 MW thermal input pressurized spout-fluid bed. Effects of gasification temperature and pressure on heat value of coal gas and component of coal gas and efficiency of desulfurization were studied. The experimental results indicate that gasification temperature is the most important influential factor to coal gasification. Velocity of gas is reduced and resident time of gasifying agent is prolonged at elevated pressure. On the other hand, there is better fluidization in the reactor at elevated pressure. So the efficiency of coal gasification can be increased and the quality of coal gas can be improved. Efficiency of desulfurization is elevated at higher temperature and pressure, Effect of temperature on efficiency of desulfurization is more remarkable than that of pressure.

A complex arrangement of bottom burners is contained in the furnace model. The hydrodynamic and radiation models are included for calculating the flue gas flow pattern and heat transfer. A molecular reactions model is applied on the basis of a two-dimensional tubular reactor model. The results calculated indicate that there is recirculation of the flue gas at each side of the reactor tubes due to the high inlet velocity from the bottom burners, which contributes to the uniformity of flue gas temperature in the furnace. Higher temperature profiles of the tube skin are mainly located 15-20 m along the tubular reactor. The calculated pyrolysis product yield and the tube skin temperatures are in good agreement with experimental data. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

The effect of the equivalence ratio, bed height and fluidization velocity on various gasification results, including the product yield distribution, gas composition, gas heating value and gas yield were studied. The equivalence ratio appeared to have a significant effect on the reactor temperature and other gasification results. The increase of the equivalence ratio favored the formation of the fuel gas and decreased the formation of the tars and char. The decrease in the hydrocarbons content and, therefore, the gas heating value with an increase in the equivalence ratio were also observed. Both the bed height and the fluidization velocity seemed to have a small influence on the gasification results. The results obtained so far indicated that fluidized bed gasification of polypropylene with air could produce a fuel gas with a calorific value in the range of 5.2-11.4 MJ/N m

Non-premixed combustion model and DO radiation model were applied for computation of combustion and heat transfer in the furnace. Molecular reactions model was applied for pyrolysis reactions and predicting products yield. It was shown that the high velocity of bottom burners' jet flow resulted in flue gas circumfluence, which played an important role in uniform of flue gas temperature in the bottom of the furnace. In addition, jet flow of bottom burners brought variation of components concentration and influenced temperature distribution of flue gas. Compared with measured data for products yield and temperature of tubeskin in olefin plant, the feasibility of simulation was indicated, and high temperature zone of tubeskin was located in 16-20 m along tubular reactor.

34248217412	Extended model for determining the separation efficiency of a cyclone with boundary layer theory	The gas residence time in Leith and Licht model was modified by means of the new predicted model of the natural vortex length aiming at most cyclones used in the practice operations (besides cylinders and cones, the dipleg and dustbin should be included in their geometries). On the other hand, the lift force on a particle in the boundary layer was considered because of larger velocity gradient here. Based on this, the extended model was obtained by the boundary layer theory. The availability of the extended model was verified by comparisons of the calculated grade efficiency with experimental data and theoretical models in the literature. The result shows that the grade efficiencies calculated by the extended model and experimental data correspond reasonably well. Comparing the extended model with the experimental data and some classical models, the extended model has more advantage in predicting the grade efficiency of the cyclone than other classical models.

34548421464	Experimental investigation of particle mixing behavior in a large spout-fluid bed	Experimental investigations on particle mixing in a larger spout-fluid bed with cross section of 1 m × 0.05 m and height of 4 m were carried out. The axial and radial distributions of tracer particle under different spouting gas velocities and fluidizing gas flow rates were measured. The particle mixing behaviors were studied according to the concentrations of tracer particles and flow patterns. Besides, the mechanism of particle mixing was preliminarily discussed. It is found that increase in spouting gas velocity and fluidizing gas flow rate can both promote the particle mixing in spout-fluid beds. Particle mixing in spout-fluid beds is due to three mechanisms: diffusion, transportation and circulation, and bubbles action. However, it changes significantly with increasing fluidizing gas flow rate and spouting gas velocity. Diffusion, transportation and circulation dominate the particle mixing at low fluidizing gas flow rates, while bubble actions dominant the particle mixing at large fluidizing gas flow rates. When increasing the spouting gas velocity, diffusion, transportation and circulation dominant the particle mixing. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

34548747035	Visualization study of the effect of the prolonged vertical tube on the separation performance of a cyclone	Cyclones have been widely used in different industrial processes. The most widely used experimental observation techniques for the flow pattern include Pitot tubes; hot-wire anemometers, as well as the non-intrusive techniques such as laser Doppler anemometry (LDA). However, all these available techniques have the limitation of only one-point measurement at a time, by which the whole-field fluid characterization in cyclones cannot be obtained simultaneously. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is a novel non-intrusive visualization experimental technique to measure the whole-field three-dimensional fluid velocity instantaneously. However, only a few papers that examined the flow pattern in cyclones with PIV have been found. The objective of this work is to carry out an elementary experimental investigation of the effect of the prolonged vertical tube on the separation performance of a cyclone by PIV. Since the tangential velocity results in the centrifugal force for particle separation, and is regarded as the most important component of the gas flow in a cyclone, this paper only presents this velocity component. To facilitate visual observation all cyclone parts are constructed of perspex. The lengths of the prolonged vertical tube (attaching a vertical tube at the bottom of the dust outlet) are 0.30m, 0.40m and 0.50m, respectively. Experiments were conducted at 18m/s inlet gas velocity. The model cyclone is set horizontally in order to take images by charge coupled device (CCD) easily. Particles of about 1 μm in diameter are added as tracer particles. They are generated by the atomizer. Air with tracer particles is sucked into the cyclone through the entry, subsequently travels through outlet tube of the cyclone and the gate valve, and is discharged into the atmosphere. The experimental results show that a typical Rankine vortex with inner quasi-forced vortex and outer quasi-free vortex in the vertical tube and dustbin which are the same as that in the body of the cyclone; the tangential velocity in the dustbin reduces1 greatly when the prolonged vertical tube attaching into the dust outlet, which can avoid the re-entrainment of already separated dust effectively. The results also indicate that PIV technique can be used to measure the strong swirl gas flow such as cyclones, and the prolonged vertical tube has practical significance for improving the separation performance of a cyclone. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

34948910650	Simulation of flow character in three-dimensional spout-fluid bed	A three-dimensional Eulerian multi-fluid model and the kinetic theory of granular flow were applied to study the gas-solid flow behavior in a spout-fluid bed coal gasifier. A small spout-fluid bed with a diameter of 100 mm was simulated. The research was done on the development of an internal jet, gas-solid flow patterns under different operating conditions and distribution of gas velocity, particle velocity, and particle phase pressure due to particle collisions under typical operating conditions. Simulation results show that when the spout wind flow is half of the total, the flow field is propitious for gasification of coal. Gas drag force and particle collision are important to particles in the annular dense region, especially near the wall. Simulation of other experimental cases was performed to illustrate the rationality of this simulation, and the simulation value was compared with the experimental one, which showed good agreement.

The gas flow velocity was measured by PIV. Gas flow graphs and gas velocity distribution characteristics at different conditions were obtained. Experimental results showed gas flow patterns in the furnace were affected mainly by bottom burners and effects of side burners can be neglected due to lesser load of side burners. The circumfluence zone was found at the each side of tubes due to high jet velocity from bottom burners. There was unsymmetrical velocity distribution in the top of the furnace because of furnace structure.

36348959663	Effects of the inlet section angle on the flow field of a cyclone	The gas flow fields of a cyclone with different inlet section angles have been studied numerically. The gas flow fields were simulated by means of the Reynolds Stress Transport Model (RSTM). The velocities and pressure drop profiles of these cyclones were investigated. The shortcut flow rates at the bottom of the vortex finder were calculated with different inlet section angles. To analyze the relationship between the inlet section angle and the vortex finder insertion deepness, this paper details the shortcut flow rates at the bottom of the vortex finder for three vortex finder insertion depths. The results indicate that the inlet section angle can decrease the shortcut flow from the bottom of the vortex finder, which has practical importance for the improvement of the separation efficiency. The inlet section angle can also decrease the pressure coefficient of a cyclone. When the inlet section angle is 45°, the level of decrease is up to 30 %. However, the effect of the inlet section angle on the separation performance is related to the dimension of the vortex finder, i.e., the insertion depth and diameter of the vortex finder, and the effect is different when the cyclone has different vortex finder insertion depths. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Experiments on a cold test facility show that long cotton stalk cannot fluidize, and adding bed material can improve the fluidization condition. Effects of length and mass percentage of cotton stalk, diameter of bed material and gas velocity on cotton stalk mixing were investigated. Long cotton stalk can mix well with 0.6-1 mm alternative bed material as fluidization number ranging between 3-7. The minimum fluidizing velocity of the binary mixture of long cotton stalk and 0.6-1 mm bed material can be obtained by experiments. In addition, the mixing criterion for binary mixture of long cotton stalk and bed material in experimental conditions is presented. When the degree of mixing is less than 1.4, the mixing state of long cotton stalk and bed material can mix well and adapt to fluidized bed combustion.

37749027556	Mixing properties of cotton stalk burnt in fluidized beds and choice of bed material	Combustion tests have been performed on a test rig of 0.2 MW thermal output. The main topics of study were the influence of stalk length, bed material s particle size, mass percentage and fluidizing velocity on mixing uniformity. Results indicate that: (1) Cotton stalk of length 10-100 mm, especially around 50 mm, can uniformly mix and get fluidized with a bed material of grain size 0.6-1 mm for a weight proportion of 2% and a fluidization number above 3. But uniformity reduces somewhat as soon as the fluidization number exceeds 7. Proportions of cotton stalk to bed material have also a certain influence on mixing. Therefore the fluidizing velocity and the static state bed height should be chosen reasonably when designing fluidizing bed boilers. (2) It was found that; when firing cotton stalk in fluidizing beds, weak acidic bed materials should be chosen, and normal fluidization of the bed material will not be affected by sintering.

The test results show that the minimum spouting velocity in a spouted-fluidized bed decreases with the increase of pressure, but the margin of such a decrease will gradually diminish. When the static bed height increases, the minimum spouting velocity will also increase. The influence of any increase of bed height on the minimum spouting velocity, however, becomes weakened with an increase of pressure.

A multi-channel pressure signal acquisition system was established to obtain the pressure fluctuation time series at various bed locations, and a high-resolution digital CCD camera used to record the flow patterns in various operating conditions. The effects of spouting gas velocity and fluidizing gas flow rate on SE were examined. The characteristics of dynamic behavior were discussed according to the operating parameters and SE. SE was found different for different flow patterns, and was used to identify the flow patterns. SE was also found significantly different at various bed locations. It indicated that a spout-fluid bed at a high spouting gas velocity or a high fluidizing gas flow rate showed no periodic nature but chaotic nature since the SE at all bed locations increased sharply and flow instabilities existed. Research results showed that SE analysis could help to understand the complex flow characteristics of spout-fluid beds, providing reference to the engineering of spout-fluid bed coal gasifiers.

The atomizing experimental results show that the atomization quality of CWP was found by correlating with the characteristics of CWP, gas to CWP mass ratio, atomization air motion, coal particle size distribution and the structure of nozzle etc. Mass median diameter (MMD) of atomized particles decreases with the increase of gas to CWP mass ratio.

33645739635	Hydrodynamic characteristics of spout-fluid bed: Pressure drop and minimum spouting/spout-fluidizing velocity	Experimental investigations on the hydrodynamic characteristics were carried out in a two-dimensional spout-fluid bed with cross section of 300 mm × 30 mm and height of 2000 mm. Six kinds of Geldart group D particles were used as bed materials. The effects of static bed height, particle property, spout nozzle width and fluidizing gas velocity on the pressure drop, maximum spouting pressure drop, minimum spouting velocity and minimum spout-fluidizing velocity were systematically studied. The results show that the total bed pressure drop appears a spouted bed characteristic when increasing the spouting gas velocity and keeping the fluidizing gas velocity constant, while it appears a fluidized bed characteristic when increasing the fluidizing gas velocity and keeping the spouting gas velocity constant. The maximum spouting pressure drop required to initiate spouting increases with static bed height and particle density, but decreases with particle diameter, spout nozzle width and fluidizing gas velocity. The minimum spouting and spout-fluidizing velocities both increase with static bed height, particle diameter, spout nozzle width. The minimum spout-fluidizing velocity increases while the minimum spouting velocity decreases with fluidizing gas velocity. Additional, correlations considered all of the above effects were developed to predict the minimum spout-fluidizing and spouting velocities of the spout-fluid bed, which were in satisfied agreement with the present experiments and some published experimental results. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

34248562691	Flow behaviors of a large spout-fluid bed at high pressure and temperature by 3D simulation with kinetic theory of granular flow	Flow behaviors of a large spout-fluid bed (I.D. 1.0 m) at high pressure and temperature were investigated by Eulerian simulation. The gas phase was modeled with k - ε turbulent model and the particle phase was modeled with kinetic theory of granular flow. The development of an internal jet, gas-solid flow patterns, particle concentrations, particle velocities and jet penetration depths at high pressure and temperature at different operating conditions were simulated. The results show that the bed operated at an initial bed height larger than the maximum spoutable bed height resembles the flow patterns of jetting fluidized beds. The radial profiles of particle velocities and concentrations at high temperature and pressure have the similar characteristic shapes to those at ambient pressure and temperature. The particle concentrations and velocities appear to depend on the bed heights when increasing pressure while keeping the gas velocities and temperature constant. The particle velocities in the lower region of the bed increase with increasing pressure, while they tend to decrease in the middle and upper regions of the bed. The particle concentrations have an opposite dependency with increasing pressure. They decrease in the lower region of the bed but increase in the middle and upper regions of the bed. Besides, the jet penetration depths are found to increase with increasing pressure. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

34248682922	Numerical study of the separation characteristics in a cyclone of different inlet particle concentrations	Numerical studies were conducted for different inlet particle concentrations of a cyclone. The simplified Eulerian model-Algebraic Slip Mixture Model (ASMM) was used for different inlet particle concentrations. With the increase of the inlet particle concentration, particle-particle interaction becomes important. ASMM can take into account this effect in this condition. The present work considered the particle of different size as different phase, and obtained a collision coefficient by experiment when considering the interaction between particles. The advantage of the ASMM is that this model can save a lot of calculating time comparing with the full Eulerian model. However, higher inlet particle concentration will result in the agglomeration between particles deduced by some mechanisms. In point of this fact, the calculated results based on ASMM have some differences comparing with the practical ones. Therefore, this model still has some discrepancies which plead for further improvement. In spite of this fact, this model can be used to analyze the effect of the inlet particle concentration on the separation characteristics of the cyclone qualitatively in practical applications. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

84926109638	Hydrodynamics of spout-fluid beds	The spout-fluid bed is a very successful modification to the conventional spouted bed. It reduces some limitations of spouting and fluidization by combining features of spouted and fluidized beds. In spout-fluid beds, in addition to supplying spouting fluid through the central nozzle, auxiliary fluid is introduced through a porous or perforated distributor surrounding the central orifice. Compared with spouted beds, spout-fluid beds obtain better gas–solid contact and mixing in the annular dense region and reduce the likelihood of particle agglomeration, dead zones, and sticking to the wall or base of the column. However, the hydrodynamics of spout-fluid beds are more complex than those of conventional spouted beds. This chapter briefly presents up-to-date information on the fundamentals and applications of spout-fluid beds without draft tubes, based on the limited reported work. Hydrodynamic characteristics Flow regimes and flow regime map Different flow regimes occur in a spout-fluid bed when the central spouting gas flowrate and the auxiliary gas flowrate are adjusted. A schematic representation of familiar flow regimes is presented in Figure 6.1. These are the fixed bed (FB), internal jet (IJ), spouting with aeration (SA), jet in fluidized bed with bubbling (JFB), jet in fluidized bed with slugging (JFS), and spout-fluidizing (SF) regimes.

Geldart group D particles of 1.6 and 2.3 mm were used as bed materials. Experimental data of minimum spouting velocity, axial pressure drop and fountain height were obtained. It was found that the minimum spouting velocity increased with increasing initial bed height and particle diameter, while it decreased with increasing fluidizing gas velocity, which is independent of pressure. Elevation of pressure yielded a decrease in minimum spouting velocity. Similar to the spouted bed, the axial pressure drop in spout-fluid bed was found to be insensitive to the change of pressure. The fountain height increased as the spouting gas velocity increased; while it decreased with particle diameter, initial bed height and fluidizing gas velocity. An increase in pressure caused an increase in the fountain height. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Experiments on a cold test facility showed that pure cotton stalk can not be fluidized, and adding bed material can improve the fluidization condition. Effects of gas velocity and mass percentage of cotton stalk on mixing characteristics were investigated. Cotton stalk can mix well with bed material at fluidization number 3-7. The minimum fluidizing velocity of the binary mixture of cotton stalk and bed material can be obtained by experiments. The study concerning the temperature profile was performed on a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) test facility with a heat input of 0.5 MW. Effects of fluidizing velocity, secondary-air ratio and cotton stalk feed rate on the temperature profiles in boiler furnace were examined. According to the experimental results, when the fluidizing velocity is up to 4.5 m/s cotton stalk can still be burned stably in the dense bed. Alternative bed material is difficult to react with alkali metals from cotton stalk ash after combustion about 12 h. It conclude that alternative bed material is favorable for use in CFB during cotton stalk combustion.

The effects of different parameters were investigated. The concentration of particles and bed temperature have a significant effect on the heat transfer coefficient. The heat transfer coefficient goes up with the increase in the concentration of particles and bed temperature. The primary air percentage and excess air coefficient have a certain degree influence. When the primary air percentage increases, the heat transfer coefficient increases. When the primary air percentage further increases, the heat transfer coefficient slightly decreases. In addition, there is an optimum excess air for higher heat transfer coefficient. The circulation ratio has a great effect on the heat transfer coefficient and in a certain range the latter increases with the circulation ratio; however at very large ratio the coefficient will be dropped due to the bed temperature decreases. The results have provided a scientific basis for boiler design of circulating fluidized bed of cotton stalk combustion.

4744358494	Thermal performance analysis of pressurized partial gasification combined cycle (APFBC-CC)	Pressurized partial gasification combined cycle (APFBC-CC) is an advanced clean coal power technology. This paper focuses on the thermodynamic performance analysis and comparison of four kinds of APFBC-CC system schemes, two based on PFB combustion and two based on atmospheric CFB combustion. The thermal performances of these combined cycles are calculated and analyzed. The results show that the first scheme, in which high temperature flue gas from PFB enters partial gasifier, avoiding high temperature gas filter, has the lower cycle efficiency and syngas heating value. The second scheme, in which flue gas directly enters gas turbine after high temperature filter, can gain the highest cycle efficiency, but it's better to low the filter operating temperature by now. The third and fourth schemes, based on CFB, have lower efficiencies than the second. But the fourth one with preheating air/steam for gasification based on the third scheme can obtain the highest heating value of syngas. On the basis of the above analysis, the better schemes are suggested.

47549104150	Study on ash characteristics and bed material of cotton stalk combustion in a fluidized bed	The physical and chemical properties of the cotton stalk in a certain area of Shandong province were reported in the paper. The fluidized bed combustion of cotton stalk was investigated in a pilot test apparatus. The ultimate analysis of the ash by ICP, and the effects of the ultimate analysis of ash deposition were emphatically studied. The high content of alkali metals and chlorine in cotton stalk is potentially harmful elements with regard to corrosion. The agglomeration of bed material is a serious problem during cotton stalk combustion. Experiments were carried out by using different bed materials. When the bed material was silica, extensive bed agglomeration problems were experienced during combustion of cotton stalk, as a consequence of the high content of alkali species in cotton stalk. SEM/EDX analysis on agglomerate samples discharged from the bed after combustion about 38 hours suggested that the high alkali metals content caused the formation of agglomeration. when the alumina was employed, the surface of the bed material did not the molten coat. Alumina was more difficult to agglomerate than silica sand as its specific properties. The results could provide basis for boiler design and operation of cotton stalk fluidized bed.

5144220871	Thermal performance analysis of advanced partial gasification combined cycle	This paper presents the thermodynamic performance analysis and comparison of four kinds of advanced pressurized fluidized bed combustion combined cycle (APFBC-CC) system schemes, two based on pressurized fluidized bed (PFB) combustion and the other two based on atmospheric circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion. The results show that the first scheme avoids high temperature gas filter, but has the lower cycle efficiency and syngas heating value. The second scheme can gain the highest cycle efficiency, however it is better to lower the filter operating temperature. The third and fourth schemes, based on CFB, have lower efficiencies than the second one. But the fourth one, with preheating air/steam for gasification, can obtain the highest heating value of syngas and gain higher efficiency than the third one.

49849085386	Experimental study on cotton stalk combustion in a circulating fluidized bed	This paper summarizes the results of an experimental study on cotton stalk (CS) combustion in a circulating fluidized bed. The mixing and fluidizing characteristics of binary mixture of CS with 10-100 mm in length and alumina bed material with a certain size distribution in a cold test facility were studied. The results show that CS by itself cannot fluidize, and adding inert bed material can improve the fluidization condition. CS can mix well with alumina at fluidization number N = 3-7. As N is more than 7, there will exist a little more segregation. The study concerning combustion characteristics of pure CS was performed on a circulating fluidized bed with a heat input of 0.5 MW. The effects of fluidizing velocity, secondary air flow and gas flow to the loop seal on the bed temperature profiles were investigated. Although there is a little more segregation at N higher than 7 in the cold tests, the hot experimental results indicate that slight segregation has little effect on the steady combustion of the dense region.

55149110321	Experimental study on flow behavior of biomass particle in a feeder	To investigate the flow behavior of biomass particle in feeder, a feeder with a full fill level of 90 kg was built. Effects of material property, fill level, rotation speed and rotation direction of helical stirrer on the flow behavior have been systematically investigated by data analysis and visual observation. The results indicated that it is hard for the biomass particle with a high bulk density and high moisture to flow in the feeder, which leads to bad discharging quality. At the same rotational speed of helical stirrer, the much higher the fill level is, the rather higher the discharging rate is. However, the discharging rate keep constant at the same fill level. With the increase of rotation speed, discharging rate increases significantly and then increases gradualy. Meanwhile, the rotation direction of helical stirrer exerts an important influence on the flow behavior and counter rotation is helpful for the improvement of discharging quality.

Geldart group B particles with mean diameters of 140 ?m and densities of 2700 kg/m3 were used as bed materials. Flow behaviors were investigated with the solid mass flux ranges from 108 to 395 kg/m2 and the superficial gas velocity ranges from 7.6 to 10.2 m/s. The pressure drop, apparent solids holdups, average slip velocity and solids-to-air mass flow ratio under different operating conditions were obtained. The results showed that the riser total pressure drop increased sharply with bed height in the low elevation but slowly in the high elevation, since the solids holdup was higher in the low region than that in the high region. The solids holdup increased with the increasing of solids mass flux while it decreased with increasing superficial gas velocity. A dense suspension upflow flow (DSU) structure was found only existing in the low elevation while the rest upper region was still in the dilute phase, and the length of DSU flow structure increased with solids mass flux. The average slip velocity was found to be the strong function of apparent solids holdup; increasing apparent solids holdup leads to the increase of slip velocity. The riser total pressure drop and apparent solids holdup increase with the solids-to-air mass flow ratio. © 2008 The Berkeley Electronic Press. All rights reserved.

Studies concerning the combustion characteristics of CS were performed in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) test facility with a heat input of 0.5 MW. According to previous cold tests, there is very little segregation during the mixing of CS with this size profile and bed material at a fluidization number of N > 7, but the hot experimental results indicate that slight segregation has a small effect on the steady combustion of the dense region. Experiments were carried out with the aim of investigating the effects of operating conditions on the axial temperature and gas concentration profiles along the combustor height, as well as the emission performance and combustion efficiency of the CFB. The experimental results indicate it is difficult to react alumina bed material with alkali metals from CS ash following 26 h of combustion. The overall conclusions appear to indicate that the application of circulating fluidized bed boilers to fire pure CS of length 10-100 mm, is feasible. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Information theory based Shannon entropy analysis of pressure fluctuation was developed to recognize chaotic nature of gas-solid flows. It was found that both Shannon entropy and Shannon entropy increment rate were pronounced with the flow patterns and transitions. Moreover, Shannon entropy increment rate could describe the change of chaotic nature with operating conditions. Increasing chaotic nature was observed with increasing fluidizing gas flow rate. When elevating bed pressure, stable flow regions became large and the chaotic nature was weakened.

The gas and particle motions were modeled with the k-ε turbulent model and DEM simulation, respectively. The cylinder-shaped particles were elongated by several spheres, which were described by a cylinder with hemi-spherical ends of the same radius. Drag-, contact- and gravitational forces acting on each individual particle were considered when establishing the mathematical models. Simulated flow patterns and pressure drops at different superficial gas velocities were in good agreement with the experimental results from a visual fluidized bed. In addition, some hydrodynamics of gas/ cylinder-shaped particle flow, i.e., bed expansion ratio, particle volume fraction, particle velocity and mean percentage of particle collisions, were obtained at various superficial gas velocities. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

With high alumina bauxite serving as bed material, and on a fluidized bed test rig having a thermal power output of 0.2 MW, the combustion characteristics of pure cotton stalks in question were studied under different operating conditions. It has been found that when the fluidization number N is greater than 3, the temperature in a dense-phase zone ranging from 850 to 880 t, and a stable combustion can be maintained, indicating that the cotton stalks and the bed material can be mixed relatively well. During the test, the concentration of main pollutant emissions was measured. After a continuous operation of 38 hours, the bed material has basically kept its original shape and appearance unchanged, and no agglomeration phenomena emerged. The tests show that the pure cotton stalks can adapt themselves to combustion in fluidized beds, and this is of major significance for guiding commercial applications on a large scale.

The change law of solid circulation rate Gs, and solids holdup were studied by the changes of the flow rate of riser, particle size and combination particle. And pressure fluctuation was analyzed by using wavelet modulus maxima method. The experimental results indicate that Gs increases gradually with the increase of riser velocity. When the velocity of superficial gas exceeds 2 m/s, the common particles express the fast area characteristics at the bottom of the riser. Its numbers of modulus maxima lines of pressure were equaled with the top. By a change of particle size distribution, fine particles can increase Gs, while coarse particles exhibit turbulence area characteristics at the bottom, and fast area characteristics in the upper of riser. Resident time of particles is prolonged. There is more number of modulus maxima lines of the bottom than the top, but long modulus maxima lines move backward with the increasing of the superficial gas of fast area.

Experiments were carried out in a visible biomass fluidized bed with a cross-section of 0.1 m by 0.03 m and height of 0.5 m. The condition of high Shannon entropy was defined as a high level of uncertainty in the ability to predict the dynamic behavior of gas - solid flow. The SEI and SEIR were regarded as the change of uncertainty and the change speed of uncertainty with operating condition, respectively. The results showed that the flow patterns of gas/cylinder-shaped biomass transited in turn with under-fluidization, steady fluidization, and turbulent fluidization when the superficial gas velocities increased. Both SEI and SEIR were pronounced with these flow patterns and transitions. The lowest values of SEI and SEIR were found in the flow pattern of steady fluidization, whereas the highest values of both parameters were found in the flow pattern of turbulent fluidization. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

70149109156	Study of gas shortcut flow rate in cyclone with different inlet section angles using response surface methodology	Numerical simulations of cyclones with various vortex finder dimensions and inlet section angles were performed to study the gas shortcut flow rate. The numerical solutions were carried out using commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code Fluent 6.1. A prediction model of the gas shortcut flow rate was obtained based on response surface methodology by means of the statistical software program (Minitab V14). The results show that the length of the vortex finder insertion, the vortex finder diameter and the inlet section angle play an important role in influencing the gas shortcut flow rate. The gas shortcut flow rate decreases when increasing the inlet section angle, and increases when increasing the vortex finder diameter and decreasing the length of the vortex finder insertion. Compared with the effect of the length of the vortex finder insertion on the shortcut flow rate, the effect of the vortex finder diameter on the gas shortcut flow rate seems more pronounced. The effect of the vortex finder dimension on the gas shortcut flow rate is changed with the different inlet section angles, i.e., the effects of the vortex finder dimension of the conventional cyclone (the inlet section angle is 0°-) on the gas shortcut flow rate is stronger than the cyclone with 30°- and 45°- inlet section angles. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

Experimental results indicated that the gas thermal value was increased by 21% when the gasifying agent preheating temperature increased from 400°C to 700°C. The concentration of combustible components hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the gas were increased from 10.55% and 9.57% to 13.62% and 13.12% respectively, while the concentration of incombustible components nitrogen and carbon dioxide in the gas were decreased from 61.03% and 16.14% to 57.03% and 13.7% respectively, and the concentration of methane changed slightly. Increasing the gasifying agent temperature would increase the gasification efficiency from 49.3% to 56%. The carbon conversion and dry gas yield changed little with the increase of the gasifying agent preheating temperature. A special flow field in the rising section of CFB has been realized with turbulent in the lower part and core-annulus in the upper part, which can not only enhance the fluidized state, but also promote the gas thermal value, gas yield and gasification efficiency, providing a more suitable way for coal gasification as compared with other CFB gasification experiments. © All Rights Reserved.

75149127790	Flow regime distinguish in a circulating fluidized bed gasifier based on wavelet modulus maxima	Pressure fluctuation is often used to analyze the dynamic changes of the gas-solid fluidized beds. In this paper, cold tests were carried out to study the gasification system of circulating fluidized beds gasifier, to find out the change law of the solid circulation rate Gs and the holdup by altering such parameters as air velocity, particle size and integrated particle, and recognize the flow regime in the boiler through analysis of the differential pressure fluctuation signals with wavelet transform modulus maximum method. Results indicate that Gs increases with the increase of the superficial gas velocity. When the superficial gas velocity is higher than 2m/s, the three kinds of particles with higher distribution concentration of particle size exhibit characteristics of fast fluidization at the bottom of the riser, and the number of modulus maxima lines is almost the same as that in the top area. Change the distribution range of particle sizes of bed materials, and the larger particles in the riser after particle separation exhibit characteristics of both the turbulence region at the bottom and the fast region on the top, prolonging their residence time in the bed. There are more modulus maxima lines for the differential pressure fluctuation signals at the bottom than on the top. The regime recognition method based on modulus maximum and its experimental results will help us learn more about the design, enlargement and operation of circulating fluidized beds.

The test facility as well as its operation behavior is described. Furthermore, the parameter pressure is investigated regarding to its influence on the producer gas composition. The study results show that the gasification quality is improved at elevated pressure because of the better fluidization in the reactor. Coal gasification at a higher pressure shows advantages in lower heat value and carbon conversion. The gas heating value is increased by 15% when the gasifier pressure increases from 0.1 MPa to 0.3 MPa. Increasing the gasifier pressure would increase the carbon conversion from 57.52% to 76.76%. The dry gas yield and the efficiency of cold gas increase a little with the increase of the gasifier pressure. There exists an optimal gasifier pressure for a certain CFB coal gasification process.

The in situ experiments were performed to study the effects of operational variables on boiler performance by changing individual variables while the other variables were held nearly constant on the basis of the nominal load operation. It was found that the oxygen level was a significant parameter to affect the NOx emission. The impacts of coal properties on NOx emission indicated that NOx emission level decreased with the increase of the ratio of the nitrogen content to low heating value because the volatile matter content in coal significantly influenced the in-flame NOx formation. Coal volatile content was the dominant parameter to affect fuel NOx formation through affecting the reducing condition in the inner near-burner zone when the low NOx burners were applied in the boiler. © 2009 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84866111182	Analysis on the influence of coal properties on NOx emissions of large-scale boilers equipped with advanced low-NOx combustion systems	The fast development and application of low-NOx combustion technologies have significantly influence on the operation performance of coal-fired utility boilers. With the application of advanced low-NOx combustion technologies, the characteristics of NOx emissions from pulverized coal-fired furnace and the trends of various factors influencing on the emissions may also be different from understandings from the experiences of using the previous technologies. It is well known that coal properties are among the most important factors to affect NOx emission levels. However, the modern low NOx combustion technologies are all based on controlling coal particle combustion process but fitting with the properties of the fired coals. Therefore, the influence of coal properties on NOx emissions of modern large-scale boilers, particularly those equipped with advanced low-NOx combustion systems, is worthy of a further study. In the present work, extensive in-situ measured NOx emission data as well as coal properties of more than 40 pulverized coalfired units with the installed capacity of 300 - 1000 MW were collected and analyzed to establish the correlation between NOx emission and coal properties. When comparing the impacts of coal volatile content and N content on NOx emission concentrations between different boilers, it was found that, for the boilers burning high volatile bituminous coals, the impacts of coal properties on the NOx emissions of the boilers equipped with advanced low-NOx combustion systems are not long significant. When considering coal properties impact on a certain boiler equipped with advanced low-NOx combustion system, its NOx emission was found in general to decrease with the increases of the coal N and volatile contents. It implies that, for a certain boiler considered, coal properties are still the main factor influencing the NOx emission concentration. The present work presented the further understanding of the influence of coal quality on NOx emission of modern pulverized coal-fired boilers. The data and results will be detailed in the full manuscript. © Tsinghua University Press, Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

Derived was a true rheological model of water-coal paste after a slip correction. Test results indicate that the water coal paste rheological model conforms to Herschel-Bulkey fluid characteristics. The influence of slip on in-tube flow rate will increase with a decrease in wall-surface shear stress and diminish with an increase in tube diameter.

0037455363	Coal-water paste water-seeping properties under pressure and its pumpability	Water-seeping properties of coal-water paste (CWP) under pressure are studied experimentally with the influence of particle size distribution and water content, etc on the pumping properties of CWP being analyzed. In conjunction with a CWP slump index proposed is a pumpability evaluation index of the CWP. It is found that the pumpability of the CWP can be featured by two indexes, namely, the slump and the total quantity of water seeping under pressure. The CWP with a good pumpability has a slump in the range of 8 - 24cm. The corresponding relative water seeping rate and water seeping quantity are respectively S

84869996295	Operation of a pressurized CFB gasification for bituminous coal	The effect of furnace pressure on bituminous coal gasification was studied on laboratory-scale pressurized circulating fluidized bed (CFB) gasifying furnaces. Within the scope of this paper this test facility as well as its operation behavior is described. Furthermore the parameter pressure has been investigated regarding to its influence on the producer gas composition, carbon conversion, carbon content of fly ash, yield of dry gas, efficiency of cold gas and low heat value (LHV) of coal gas are presented and discussed in the following. The study results showed that the gasification quality was improved at elevated pressure because of the better fluidization in the reactor. Coal gasification at a higher pressure shows advantages in LHV, and carbon conversion. The dry gas yield and efficiency of cold gas increased little with the increase of the furnace pressure. For a certain CFB coal gasification process, when the pressure is 0.3-0.4MPa, this parameter had an optimum operating figure. ©2010 IEEE.

84870011677	The fractal properties of calcination of limestone and its sulfidation with H 2S	Fractal geometry was used to describe the calcination of limestones and the sulfur-removal process performed in TGA instrument, and the fractal dimension was calculated through the nitrogen adsorption. The effect of calcination of limestones on the porous structure and fractal dimension of calcined limestones was investigated, and the highest value of fractal dimension 2.72 can be obtained at 850°C. The fractal dimension will reduce with the increase of limestones particle size. The fractal dimension of calcined limestones has a significant influence on the sulfur-removal reactivity. It can be stated that the highest reaction reactivity can be obtained when the calcined limestone has a moderate fractal dimension of 2.70.

84904822327	Dem simulation of cylinder-shaped particles flow in a gas-solid fluidized bed	Three dimensional DEM simulation of cylinder-shaped particles flow in a gas-solid fluidized bed were carried out. The gas motion was modeled with k-ε two-equation turbulent model and the particle motion was modeled by discrete element method. The cylinder-shaped particle was elongated by several spheres, which was described by a cylinder with hemispherical ends of the same radius. Drag force, contract force and gravitational force acting on individual particle were considered when establishing the mathematics models. Simulated flow patterns and pressure drops at different superficial gas velocities were in well agreement with the experiments on a visual fluidized bed.

10044247104	Jet penetration depth in a two-dimensional spout-fluid bed	The jet penetration depth was proposed to be an important parameter to describe the jet action during the chemical process of spout-fluid bed coal gasification. A two-dimensional cold model of a spout-fluid bed coal gasifier with its cross section of 300 mm × 30 mm and height of 2000 mm was established to investigate the jet penetration depth. Four types of Geldart group D particles were used as bed materials. A multi-channel pressure sampling system and a high-resolution digital CCD camera were employed for experimental investigations. The effects of spouting gas velocity, spout nozzle diameter, static bed height, particle property and fluidizing gas flow rate on the jet penetration depth have been systematically studied by pressure signal analysis and image processing. Experimental results indicate that the jet penetration depth increases with increasing spouting gas velocity and spout nozzle diameter, while it decreases with increasing particle density, particle diameter, static bed height and fluidizing gas flow rate. Additional, a new correlation considered all of the above effects especially static bed height and fluidizing gas flow rate, was developed for predicting the jet penetration depth in spout-fluid beds. The correlation was compared with published experimental data or correlations, which was in well agreement with the present experimental results and some other references. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

11444265311	Three-dimensional numerical simulation on conveying properties of gas-solid injector under pressurization	By using three-dimensional numerical simulation technique together with the Lagrangian and Eulerian methods, a detailed numerical simulation research of an important parameter affecting the conveying characteristics of the convergent gas-solid injector was performed. In this numerical model, the interaction between the particles and gas turbulence was considered. The calculation results indicate that the axial mean speed of particles in the gas-solid injector increased as the convergent section angle is decreased. However it shows little influence on the mean speed of particles and the mixing process of gas-solid flow in the injector when the convergent section angle is less than a critical angle. In addition, the convergent section angle and the inlet velocity of driving jet also affect the static pressure distribution in the convergent gas-solid injector.
