8844274059	Phylogeny of mitochondrial DNA macrohaplogroup N in India, based on complete sequencing: Implications for the peopling of South Asia	To resolve the phylogeny of the autochthonous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups of India and determine the relationship between the Indian and western Eurasian mtDNA pools more precisely, a diverse subset of 75 macrohaplogroup N lineages was chosen for complete sequencing from a collection of >800 control-region sequences sampled across India. We identified five new autochthonous haplogroups (R7, R8, R30, R31, and N5) and fully characterized the autochthonous haplogroups (RS, R6, N1d, U2a, U2b, and U2c) that were previously described only by first hypervariable segment (HVS-I) sequencing and coding-region restriction-fragment-length polymorphism analysis. Our findings demonstrate that the Indian mtDNA pool, even when restricted to macrohaplogroup N, harbors at least as many deepest-branching lineages as the western Eurasian mtDNA pool. Moreover, the distribution of the earliest branches within haplogroups M, N, and R across Eurasia and Oceania provides additional evidence for a three-founder-mtDNA scenario and a single migration route out of Africa.

17244370617	Mitochondrial DNA 3243, 3316 point mutations and type 2 diabetes mellitus	Objective: To investigate the prevalence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation at position 3243 (A/G) and 3316 (G/A) in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: Two hundred and twenty-five unrelated Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes and 195 nondiabetic control individuals without family history of diabetes in Yunnan were examined. The presence of mt 3243 and 3316 mutations was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP). Finally, mutant mtDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Results: The mitochondrial DNA mutation at position 3316 was found in 5 of 225 (2.22%) patients with type 2 diabetes, and this mutation was found in 2 of 195 (1.03%) control individuals. There was no significant difference in respect to the frequency of the mutation between patients and controls. The mitochondrial DNA mutation at position 3243 was not found in any of the patients and controls. Conclusion: The results suggest that the prevalence of the mitochondrial tRNA

20444443621	Low "penetrance" of phylogenetic knowledge in mitochondrial disease studies	An up-to-date view of the worldwide mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogeny together with an evaluation of the conservation of each site is a reliable tool for detecting errors in mtDNA studies and assessing the functional importance of alleged pathogenic mutations. However, most of the published studies on mitochondrial diseases make very little use of the phylogenetic knowledge that is currently available. This drawback has two inadvertent consequences: first, there is no sufficient a posteriori quality assessment of complete mtDNA sequencing efforts; and second, no feedback is provided for the general mtDNA database when apparently new mtDNA lineages are discovered. We demonstrate, by way of example, these issues by reanalysing three mtDNA sequencing attempts, two from Europe and another one from East Asia. To further validate our phylogenetic deductions, we completely sequenced two mtDNAs from healthy subjects that nearly match the mtDNAs of two patients, whose sequences gave problematic results. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

26444616729	Phantom mutation hotspots in human mitochondrial DNA	Phantom mutations are systematic artifacts generated in the course of the sequencing process. Contra common belief these artificial mutations are nearly ubiquitous in sequencing results, albeit at frequencies that may vary dramatically. The amount of artifacts depends not only on the sort of automated sequencer and sequencing chemistry employed, but also on other lab-specific factors. An experimental study executed on four samples under various combinations of sequencing conditions revealed a number of phantom mutations occurring at the same sites of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) repeatedly. To confirm these and identify further hotspots for artifacts, > 5000 mtDNA electropherograms were screened for artificial patterns. Further, > 30 000 published hypervariable segment I sequences were compared at potential hotspots for phantom mutations, especially for variation at positions 16085 and 16197. Resequencing of several samples confirmed the artificial nature of these and other polymorphisms in the original publications. Single-strand sequencing, as typically executed in medical and anthropological studies, is thus highly vulnerable to this kind of artifacts. In particular, phantom mutation hotspots could easily lead to misidentification of somatic mutations and to misinterpretations in all kinds of clinical mtDNA studies. © 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

29144504375	More evidence for non-maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA?	Background: A single case of paternal co-transmission of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in humans has been reported so far. Objective: To find potential instances of non-maternal inheritance of mtDNA. Methods: Published medical case studies (of single patients) were searched for irregular mtDNA patterns by comparing the given haplotype information for different clones or tissues with the worldwide mtDNA database as known to date-a method that has proved robust and reliable for the detection of flawed mtDNA sequence data. Results: More than 20 studies were found reporting clear cut instances with mtDNAs of different ancestries in single individuals. As examples, cases are reviewed from recent published reports which, at face value, may be taken as evidence for paternal inheritance of mtDNA or recombination. Conclusions: Multiple types (or recombinant types) of quite dissimilar mitochondrial DNA from different parts of the known mtDNA phylogeny are often reported in single individuals. From re-analyses and corrigenda of forensic mtDNA data, it is apparent that the phenomenon of mixed or mosaic mtDNA can be ascribed solely to contamination and sample mix up.

33745275886	Updating the East Asian mtDNA phylogeny: A prerequisite for the identification of pathogenic mutations	Knowledge about the world phylogeny of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is essential not only for evaluating the pathogenic role of specific mtDNA mutations but also for performing reliable association studies between mtDNA haplogroups and complex disorders. In the past few years, the main features of the East Asian portion of the mtDNA phylogeny have been determined on the basis of complete sequencing efforts, but representatives of several basal lineages were still lacking. Moreover, some recently published complete mtDNA sequences did apparently not fit into the known phylogenetic tree and conflicted with the established nomenclature. To refine the East Asian mtDNA tree and resolve data conflicts, we first completely sequenced 20 carefully selected mtDNAs - likely representatives of novel sub-haplogroups - and then, in order to distinguish diagnostic mutations of novel haplogroups from private variants, we applied a 'motif-search' procedure to a large sample collection. The novel information was incorporated into an updated East Asian mtDNA tree encompassing more than 1000 (near-) complete mtDNA sequences. A reassessment of the mtDNA data from a series of disease studies testified to the usefulness of such a refined mtDNA tree in evaluating the pathogenicity of mtDNA mutations. In particular, the claimed pathogenic role of mutations G3316A, T3394C, A4833G and G15497A appears to be most questionable as those initial claims were derived from anecdotal findings rather than e.g. appropriate association studies. Following a guideline based on the phylogenetic knowledge as proposed here could help avoiding similar problems in the future. © 2006 Oxford University Press.

33746899305	mtDNA mutation C1494T, haplogroup A, and hearing loss in Chinese	Mutation C1494T in mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene was recently reported in two large Chinese families with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic hearing loss (AINHL) and was claimed to be pathogenic. This mutation, however, was first reported in a sample from central China in our previous study that was aimed to reconstruct East Asian mtDNA phylogeny. All these three mtDNAs formed a subclade defined by mutation C1494T in mtDNA haplogroup A. It thus seems that mutation C1494T is a haplogroup A-associated mutation and this matrilineal background may contribute a high risk for the penetrance of mutation C1494T in Chinese with AINHL. To test this hypothesis, we first genotyped mutation C1494T in 553 unrelated individuals from three regional Chinese populations and performed an extensive search for published complete or near-complete mtDNA data sets (>3000 mtDNAs), we then screened the C1494T mutation in 111 mtDNAs with haplogroup A status that were identified from 1823 subjects across China. The search for published mtDNA data sets revealed no other mtDNA besides the above-mentioned three carrying mutation C1494T. None of the 553 randomly selected individuals and the 111 haplogroup A mtDNAs was found to bear this mutation. Therefore, our results suggest that C1494T is a very rare event. The mtDNA haplogroup A background in general is unlikely to play an active role in the penetrance of mutation C1494T in AINHL. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33846799015	The role of climate in human mitochondrial DNA evolution: A reappraisal	Previous studies have proposed that selection has been involved in the differentiation of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and climate was the main driving force. This viewpoint, however, gets no support from the subsequent studies and remains controversial thus far. To clarify this issue, a total of 237 complete mtDNA sequences belonging to autochthonous lineages from South Asia, Oceania, and East Asia were collected to seek for the imprint of selection. Based on nonsynonymous (N) and synonymous (S) substitutions analysis, our results confirmed that purifying selection was the predominant force during the evolution of human mtDNA. However, no significant and extensive difference was detected among these three regions, which did not support the climate adaptation hypothesis but preferred random genetic drift to be the main factor in shaping the current landscape of human mtDNA, at least those from Asian and Oceanian regions. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

34548064910	Somatic mutations of mitochondrial genome in early stage breast cancer	The complete mitochondrial genomes of the primary cancerous, matched paracancerous normal and distant normal tissues from 10 early-stage breast cancer patients were analyzed in this study, with special attempt (i) to investigate whether the reported high frequency of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) somatic mutations in breast cancer could be repeated under a stringent data quality control, and (ii) to characterize the spectrum of mtDNA somatic mutations in Chinese breast cancer patients and evaluate their potential significance in early cancer diagnosis. Two heteroplasmic somatic transitions (T2275C and A8601G) were identified in our samples. The transition A8601G was present in the primary cancerous and paracancerous normal tissues from patient no. 3. Transition T2275C was found in the primary cancerous tissue but not in other normal tissues from patient no. 6; this transition has been reported in the colonic crypts and is located at a highly conserved site in the 16S rRNA gene. Subsequent cloning sequencing confirmed the absence of both mutations in the distant normal tissues from the 2 patients. The overall rate of somatic mutations in our patients was much lower than those of previous studies of breast cancer. Our results gave support to the recent claim that the high frequency of mtDNA somatic mutations in cancer studies is overestimated. Based on the mtDNA mutation pattern in early stage breast cancer observed in this study, we cautioned the enthusiasms and efforts to look for somatic mutations that were of diagnostic value in cancer early detection. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

38649132611	Analysis of mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms in Guangdong Han Chinese	Previous investigations on Chinese mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation revealed that the matrilineal gene pool of southern Han Chinese is rather complex, with much higher genetic diversity and more basal/ancient lineages than the northern Hans. The extreme case is Guangdong Han populations, among which pronounced (matrilineal) differentiation has been observed, indicative of complex demography of the region. To get more insights into the maternal makeup of southern Han Chinese, mtDNA variation of a total of 106 individuals sampled from Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China, was analyzed in this study. With the aid of the information from control-region hypervariable segments I and II (HVS-I and -II) as well as some necessary coding-region segments, the phylogenetic status of all mtDNAs under examination were determined according to the reconstructed East Asian mtDNA tree. In this way, the mtDNAs have been classified into various haplogroups or sub-haplogroups. The southern-prevalent haplogroups, such as R9 (20.8%), B (17.9%), M7b (14.2%), show relatively high distribution frequencies in Dongguan Hans; whereas the frequencies of Northern-prevalent haplogroups (with the exception of D) are quite low: C (1.9%), G2 (1.9%) and Z (1.9%), indicating the southern-origin of Dongguan Hans. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

33244489663	The dazzling array of basal branches in the mtDNA macrohaplogroup M from India as inferred from complete genomes	Many efforts based on complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes have been made to depict the global mtDNA landscape, but the phylogeny of Indian macrohaplogroup M has not yet been resolved in detail. To fill this lacuna, we took the same strategy as in our recent analysis of Indian mtDNA macrohaplogroup N and selected 56 mtDNAs from over 1,200 samples across India for complete sequencing, with the intention to cover all Indian autochthonous M lineages. As a result, the phylogenetic status of previously identified haplogroups based on control-region and/or partial coding-region information, such as M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M30, and M33, was solidified or redefined here. Moreover, seven novel basal M haplogroups (viz., M34-M40) were identified, and yet another five singular branches of the M phylogeny were discovered in the present study. The comparison of matrilineal components among India, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania at the deepest level yielded a star-like and nonoverlapping pattern, reflecting a rapid mode of modern human dispersal along the Asian coast after the initial "out-of-Africa" event. © The Author 2005.

46149121025	The phylogeny of the four pan-American MtDNA haplogroups: Implications for evolutionary and disease studies	Only a limited number of complete mitochondrial genome sequences belonging to Native American haplogroups were available until recently, which left America as the continent with the least of information about sequence variation of entire mitochondrial DNAs. In this study, a comprehensive overview of all available complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes of the four pan-American haplogroups A2, B2, C1, and D1 is provided by revising the information scattered throughout GenBank and the literature, and adding 14 novel mtDNA sequences. The phylogenies of haplogroups A2, B2, C1, and D1 reveal a large number of sub haplogroups but suggest that the ancestral Beringian population(s) contributed only six (successful) founder haplotypes to these haplogroups. The derived are overall starlike with coalescence times ranging from 18,000 to 21,000 years (with one exception) using the conventional calibration. The average of about 19,000 years somewhat contrast with the corresponding lower age of about 13,500 years that was recently proposed by employing a different calibration and estimation approach. Our estimate indicates a human entry and spread of the pan-American haplogroups into the Americas right after the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum and comfortably agrees with the undisputed ages of the earliest Paleoindians in South America. In addition, the phylogenetic approach also indicates that the pathogenic status proposed for various mtDNA mutations, which actually define branches of Native American haplogroups, was based on insufficient grounds. © 2008 Achilli et al.

4544328820	Phylogeographic analysis of mitochondrial DNA haplogroup F2 in China reveals T12338C in the initiation codon of the ND5 gene not to be pathogenic	In this report, we studied on a homoplasmic T12338C change in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which substituted methionine in the translational initiation codon of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 gene (ND5) with threonine. This nucleotide change was originally identified in two mtDNAs belonging to haplogroup F2 by our previous complete sequencing of 48 mtDNAs. Since then, a total of 76 F2 mtDNAs have been identified by the variations occurring in the hypervariable segments and coding regions among more than 3,000 individuals across China. As the T12338C change was detected in 32 samples representing various sub-clades of the F2 haplogroup while not in 14 non-F2 controls, we believe that the T12338C change is specific to the F2 haplogroup. As F2 and its sub-clades were widely distributed in normal individuals of various Chinese populations, we conclude that T12338C is not pathogenic. In addition, based on the average distribution frequency, haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity of haplogroup F2 in the populations across China, the T12338C nucleotide substitution seems to have been occurred in north China about 42,000 years ago. Our results provided a good paradigm for distinguishing a polymorphic change from a pathogenic mutation based on mtDNA phylogeny.

49049096478	Strikingly different penetrance of LHON in two Chinese families with primary mutation G11778A is independent of mtDNA haplogroup background and secondary mutation G13708A	The penetrance of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) in families with primary mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations is very complex. Matrilineal and nuclear genetic background, as well as environmental factors, have been reported to be involved in different affected pedigrees. Here we describe two large Chinese families that show a striking difference in the penetrance of LHON, in which 53.3% and 15.0% of members were affected (P < 0.02), respectively. Analysis of the complete mtDNA genome of the two families revealed the presence of the primary mutation G11778A and several other variants suggesting the same haplogroup status G2a. The family with higher penetrance contained a previously described secondary mutation G13708A, which presents a polymorphism in normal Chinese samples and does not affect in vivo mitochondrial oxidative metabolism as described in a previous study. Evolutionary analysis failed to indicate any putatively pathogenic mutation that cosegregated with G11778A in these two pedigrees. Our results suggest that the variable penetrance of LHON in the two Chinese families is independent of both their mtDNA haplotype background and a secondary mutation G13708A. As a result, it is likely that unknown nuclear gene involvement and/or other factors contribute to the strikingly different penetrance of LHON. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

51449117849	Intriguing balancing selection on the intron 5 region of LMBR1 in human population	Background: The intron 5 of gene LMBR1 is the cis-acting regulatory module for the sonic hedgehog (SHH) gene. Mutation in this non-coding region is associated with preaxial polydactyly, and may play crucial roles in the evolution of limb and skeletal system. Methodology/Principal Findings: We sequenced a region of the LMBR1 gene intron 5 in East Asian human population, and found a significant deviation of Tajima's D statistics from neutrality taking human population growth into account. Data from HapMap also demonstrated extended linkage disequilibrium in the region in East Asian and European population, and significantly low degree of genetic differentiation among human populations. Conclusion/Significance: We proposed that the intron 5 of LMBR1 was presumably subject to balancing selection during the evolution of modern human. © 2008 He et al.

51549108496	Distilling artificial recombinants from large sets of complete mtDNA genomes	Background: Large-scale genome sequencing poses enormous problems to the logistics of laboratory work and data handling. When numerous fragments of different genomes are KR amplified and sequenced in a laboratory, there is a high immanent risk of sample confusion. For genetic markers, such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which are free of natural recombination, single instances of sample mix-up involving different branches of the mtDNA phylogeny would give rise to reticulate patterns and should therefore be detectable. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have developed a strategy for comparing new complete mtDNA genomes, one by one, to a current skeleton of the worldwide mtDNA phylogeny. The mutations distinguishing the reference sequence from a putative recombinant sequence can then be allocated to two or more different branches of this phylogenetic skeleton. Thus, one would search for two (or three) near-matches in the total mtDNA database that together best explain the variation seen in the recombinants. The evolutionary pathway from the mtDNA tree connecting this pair together with the recombinant then generate a grid-like median network, from which one can read off the exchanged segments. Conclusions: We have applied this procedure to a large collection of complete human mtDNA sequences, where several recombinants could be distilled by our method. All these recombinant sequences were subsequently corrected by de novo experiments - fully concordant with the predictions from out data-analytical approach. © 2008 Kong et al.

56049096966	Polymorphisms in the C-type lectin genes cluster in chromosome 19 and predisposition to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection	Background: Polymorphisms of CLEG4M have been associated with predisposition for infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). DC-SIGNR, a C-type lectin encoded by CLEC4M, is a receptor for the virus. A variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in its neck region was recently associated with susceptibility to SABS infection. However, this association was controversial and was not supported by subsequent studies. Two explanations may account for this discrepancy: (1) there may be an unknown predisposition polymorphism located in the proximity which is linked to the VNTR; or (2) it was a spurious association due to unrecognised population structure in the VNTR. Methods: We performed a comprehensively genetic association study on this C-type lectin gene cluster (FCER2, CLEC4G, CD209, and CLEC4M) at 19p13.3 by a tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) approach. Results: 23 tagSNPs were genotyped in 181 SARS patients and 172 population controls. No significant association with disease predisposition was detected. Genetic variations in this cluster also did not predict disease prognosis. However, we detected a population stratification of the VNTR alleles in a sample of 1145 Han Chinese collected from different parts of China. Conclusion: The results indicated that the genetic predisposition allele was not found in this lectin gene cluster and population stratification might cause the previous positive association.

56649112226	Pseudomitochondrial genome haunts disease studies	The accidental amplification of nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (NUMTs) can pose a serious problem for mitochondrial disease studies. This report shows that the mutation spectrum left by spurious amplification of a NUMT can be detected because it usually differs considerably from the authentic natural spectrum. This study examined the problem introduced by an ND5 gene NUMT that was recorded in a proband with hearing loss and reviews other disease studies erroneously reporting NUMT variation as genuine mutations in their patients. NUMTs can emerge in population genetic studies, as exemplified here by cases in this study and from published sources. Appropriate database searches and a phylogenetic approach can prevent hasty claims for novelty of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants inadvertently derived from NUMTs and help to direct investigators to the real source.

58549117665	Distinctive Paleo-Indian Migration Routes from Beringia Marked by Two Rare mtDNA Haplogroups	Background: It is widely accepted that the ancestors of Native Americans arrived in the New World via Beringia approximately 10 to 30 thousand years ago (kya). However, the arrival time(s), number of expansion events, and migration routes into the Western Hemisphere remain controversial because linguistic, archaeological, and genetic evidence have not yet provided coherent answers. Notably, most of the genetic evidence has been acquired from the analysis of the common pan-American mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups. In this study, we have instead identified and analyzed mtDNAs belonging to two rare Native American haplogroups named D4h3 and X2a. Results: Phylogeographic analyses at the highest level of molecular resolution (69 entire mitochondrial genomes) reveal that two almost concomitant paths of migration from Beringia led to the Paleo-Indian dispersal approximately 15-17 kya. Haplogroup D4h3 spread into the Americas along the Pacific coast, whereas X2a entered through the ice-free corridor between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. The examination of an additional 276 entire mtDNA sequences provides similar entry times for all common Native American haplogroups, thus indicating at least a dual origin for Paleo-Indians. Conclusions: A dual origin for the first Americans is a striking novelty from the genetic point of view, and it makes plausible a scenario positing that within a rather short period of time, there may have been several entries into the Americas from a dynamically changing Beringian source. Moreover, this implies that most probably more than one language family was carried along with the Paleo-Indians. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mitonchondrial complex I deficiency is a main cause of Leigh syndrome. In this study, a Chinese child with Leigh syndrome caused by 13513G > A mutation was reported. The proband was the first child of his parents. The previously healthy boy presented with generalized epilepsy at 12 years of age. When he visited Peking University First Hospital at 13 years of age, he had subacute loss of vision in two eyes and temporal defect of visual field in the left eye. He walked with a spastic gait. His blood lactate and pyruvate levels were elevated. Muscle biopsy showed mild lipid accumulation in muscle fiber. An electrocardiogram showed incomplete right bundle branch block. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral, symmetrical lesions in the basal ganglia, supporting the diagnosis of Leigh syndrome. 13513G > A mutation was identified by gene analysis in the patient, which led to mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I deficiency. Multivitamins and L-carnitine were administered. At present, the patient is 16 years old and has progressive deterioration with significant muscle weakness and body weight loss. He is absent from school. He has no obvious retardation in intelligence. 13513G > A mutation was first identified by gene analysis in Chinese population with Leigh syndrome.

Three non-synonymous homoplasmic variants in subunit six of the ATP synthase (MT-ATP6) gene that were detected only in patients but not in controls were suggested to be slightly deleterious, because (1) their original amino acid residues (AA) were highly conserved and (2) the physicochemical differences between the original and altered AA were relatively high. In addition, we detected three novel heteroplasmic variants that were potentially pathogenic. Although functional analysis is needed, rare variants in the mtDNA may convey susceptibility to schizophrenia. © 2009 Mitochondria Research Society.

73249137806	The neck-region polymorphism of DC-SIGNR in peri-centenarian from Han Chinese Population	Background: DC-SIGNR (also called CD209L) has been extensively studied on its role in host genetic predisposition to viral infection. In particular, variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) of the neck-region of DC-SIGNR is highly polymorphic and the polymorphism has been investigated for genetic predisposition to various infectious diseases, though conflicting results had been reported. As infection is a major cause of human death and a mechanism of natural selection, we hypothesized that VNTR polymorphism of DC-SIGNR might have an effect on human life span. Methods: Here we collected 361 peri-centenarian individuals (age ≥94 for female and age ≥90 for male) and 342 geographically matched controls (age 22-53, mean 35.0 ± 12.0) from Han Chinese. The VNTR polymorphism of the neck region was determined by PCR and genotype was called by separating the PCR products in agarose gel. Results: A total of 11 genotypes and 5 alleles were found in our population. The genotype distribution, allele frequencies and homozygote proportion did not show a significant difference between peri-centenarian and control group. As gender differences in lifespan are ubiquitously observed throughout the animal kingdom, we then stratified the samples by gender. There was more 6/7 genotypes in female peri-centenarian group than that in female control group, at a marginal level of significance (5.56 vs. 1.28%, p = 0.041). The difference was not significant after correction by Bonferroni method. It suggests a possible differential effect of DC-SIGNR VNTR genotypes between sexes. Further studies are warranted to confirm our preliminary findings and investigate the mechanisms of the underlying functions. Conclusions: Our study indicated that there was absence of association between the neck region polymorphism of DC-SIGNR and longevity in Han Chinese population. But the question of whether the DC-SIGNR could affect longevity in a gender-specific pattern remains open. © 2009 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

74749092186	Tracing the origins of Hakka and Chaoshanese by mitochondrial DNA analysis	Hakka and Chaoshanese are two unique Han populations residing in southern China but with northern Han (NH) cultural traditions and linguistic influences. Although most of historical records indicate that both populations migrated from northern China in the last two thousand years, no consensus on their origins has been reached so far. To shed more light on the origins of Hakka and Chaoshanese, mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) of 170 Hakka from Meizhou and 102 Chaoshanese from Chaoshan area, Guangdong Province, were analyzed. Our results show that some southern Chinese predominant haplogroups, e.g. B, F, and M7, have relatively high frequencies in both populations. Although median network analyses show that Hakka/Chaoshanese share some haplotypes with NH, interpopulation comparison reveals that both populations show closer affinity with southern Han (SH) populations than with NH. In consideration of previous results from nuclear gene (including Y chromosome) research, it is likely that matrilineal landscapes of both Hakka and Chaoshanese have largely been shaped by the local people during their migration southward and/or later colonization in southern China, and factors such as cultural assimilation, patrilocality, and even sex-bias in the immigrants might have played important roles during the process. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

75849116319	Mitochondrial genome evidence reveals successful Late Paleolithic settlement on the Tibetan Plateau	Due to its numerous environmental extremes, the Tibetan Plateau - the world's highest plateau - is one of the most challenging areas of modern human settlement. Archaeological evidence dates the earliest settlement on the plateau to the Late Paleolithic, while previous genetic studies have traced the colonization event(s) to no earlier than the Neolithic. To explore whether the genetic continuity on the plateau has an exclusively Neolithic time depth, we studied mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome variation within 6 regional Tibetan populations sampled from Tibet and neighboring areas. Our results confirm that the vast majority of Tibetan matrilineal components can trace their ancestry to Epipaleolithic and Neolithic immigrants from northern China during the mid-Holocene. Significantly, we also identified an infrequent novel haplogroup, M16, that branched off directly from the Eurasian M founder type. Its nearly exclusive distribution in Tibetan populations and ancient age (>21 kya) suggest that M16 may represent the genetic relics of the Late Paleolithic inhabitants on the plateau. This partial genetic continuity between the Paleolithic inhabitants and the contemporary Tibetan populations bridges the results and inferences from archaeology, history, and genetics.

77952299473	Mitochondrial DNA haplogroup distribution in Chaoshanese with and without myopia	Purpose: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups affect the clinical expression of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, age-related macular degeneration, and other diseases. The objective of this study is to investigate whether an mtDNA background is associated with myopia. Methods: Blood DNA was obtained from 192 college students, including 96 individuals with moderate-to-high myopia and 96 controls without myopia. All the subjects were from a well-known isolated population living in the Chaoshan area of east Guangdong Province and speaking one of the four major dialects in southern China. The mtDNA haplogroups in the 192 subjects were determined by sequencing the mtDNA control region and partial coding regions as well as by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Each mtDNA was classified according to the updated version of the Eastern Asian haplogroup system. Results: Sixteen mtDNA haplogroups were recognized in the 192 subjects. The overall matrilineal structures of the samples with and without myopia were similar and had genetic imprints showing their ethno-origin. There was no statistical difference in frequencies of haplogroup distribution between subjects with and without myopia (χ2 test, p=0.556).

77951868801	The acquisition of an inheritable 50-bp deletion in the human mtDNA control region does not affect the mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood cells	The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region is believed to play an important biological role in mtDNA replication. Large deletions in this region are rarely found, but when they do occur they might be expected to interfere with the replication of the molecule, thus leading to a reduction of mtDNA copy number. During a survey for mtDNA sequence variations in 5,559 individuals from the general Chinese population and 2,538 individuals with medical disorders, we identified a 50-bp deletion (m.298-347del50) in the mtDNA control region in a member of a healthy Han Chinese family belonging to haplogroup B4c1b2, as suggested by complete mtDNA genome sequencing. This deletion removes the conserved sequence block II (CSBII; region 299-315) and the replication primer location (region 317-321). However, quantification of the mtDNA copy number in this subject showed a value within a range that was observed in 20 healthy subjects without the deletion. The deletion was detected in the hair samples of the maternal relatives of the subject and exhibited variable heteroplasmy. Our current observation, together with a recent report for a benign 154-bp deletion in the mtDNA control region, suggests that the control of mtDNA replication may be more complex than we had thought. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77955845106	The MT-ND1 and MT-ND5 genes are mutational hotspots for Chinese families with clinical features of LHON but lacking the three primary mutations	LHON is one of the most common and primary causes of acute blindness in young male adults. Over 95% of LHON cases are caused by one of the three primary mutations (m.11778G>A, m.14484T>C, and m.3460G>A). In contrast to these genetically diagnosed LHON patients, there are many patients with clinical features of LHON but without the three primary mutations, and these patients have been insufficiently analyzed. We reported 10 suspected Chinese LHON families without the three primary mutations. The overall penetrance (53.4%) in these families is significantly higher than in those families with m.11778G>A (33.3%) or m.3460G>A (25.6%). Complete mtDNA genome sequencing of the 10 families showed that they belonged to different haplogroups and all identified variants (excluding m.12332A>G in mt-tRNA

77957229870	Tracing the Austronesian footprint in Mainland Southeast Asia: A perspective from mitochondrial DNA	As the relic of the ancient Champa Kingdom, the Cham people represent the major Austronesian speakers in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) and their origin is evidently associated with the Austronesian diffusion in MSEA. Hitherto, hypotheses stemming mainly from linguistic and cultural viewpoints on the origin of the Cham people remain a welter of controversies. Among the points of dissension is the muddled issue of whether the Cham people arose from demic or cultural diffusion from the Austronesians. Addressing this issue also helps elucidate the dispersal mode of the Austronesian language. In the present study, we have analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control-region and coding-region sequence variations in 168 Cham and 139 Kinh individuals from Vietnam. Around 77% and 95% matrilineal components in the Chams and the Kinhs, respectively, could be assigned into the defined mtDNA haplogroups. Additionally, three common East Eurasian haplogroups B, R9, and M7 account for the majority (>60%) of maternal components in both populations. Entire sequencing of 20 representative mtDNAs selected from the thus far unclassified lineages, together with four new mtDNA genome sequences from Thailand, led to the identification of one new haplogroup M77 and helped to re-evaluate several haplogroups determined previously. Comparing the Chams with other Southeast Asian populations reveals that the Chams had a closer affinity with the Mon-Khmer populations in MSEA than with the Austronesian populations from Island Southeast Asia (ISEA). Further analyses failed to detect the potential homelands of the Chams in ISEA. Therefore, our results suggested that the origin of the Cham was likely a process of assimilation of massive local Mon-Khmer populations accompanied with language shift, thus indicating that the Austronesian diffusion in MSEA was mainly mediated by cultural diffusion, at least from the matrilineal genetic perspective, an observation in agreement with the hypothesis of the Nusantao Maritime Trading and Communication Networks. © 2010 The Author.

78650455617	Large-Scale mtDNA screening reveals a surprising matrilineal complexity in East Asia and Its implications to the peopling of the region	In order to achieve a thorough coverage of the basal lineages in the Chinese matrilineal pool, we have sequenced the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and partial coding region segments of 6,093 mtDNAs sampled from 84 populations across China. By comparing with the available complete mtDNA sequences, 194 of those mtDNAs could not be firmly assigned into the available haplogroups. Completely sequencing 51 representatives selected from these unclassified mtDNAs identified a number of novel lineages, including five novel basal haplogroups that directly emanate from the Eurasian founder nodes (M and N). No matrilineal contribution from the archaic hominid was observed. Subsequent analyses suggested that these newly identified basal lineages likely represent the genetic relics of modern humans initially peopling East Asia instead of being the results of gene flow from the neighboring regions. The observation that most of the newly recognized mtDNA lineages have already differentiated and show the highest genetic diversity in southern China provided additional evidence in support of the Southern Route peopling hypothesis of East Asians. Specifically, the enrichment of most of the basal lineages in southern China and their rather ancient ages in Late Pleistocene further suggested that this region was likely the genetic reservoir of modern humans after they entered East Asia. © 2010 The Author.

78651361372	Mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms in Gelao ethnic group residing in Southwest China	Gelao ethnic group, an aboriginal population residing in southwest China, has undergone a long and complex evolutionary process. To investigate the genetic structure of this ancient ethnic group, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphisms of 102 Gelao individuals were collected and analyzed in this study. With the aid of the information extracted from control-region hypervariable segments (HVSs) I and II as well as some necessary coding-region segments, phylogenetic status of all mtDNAs under study were determined by means of classifying into various defined haplogroups. The southern-prevalent haplogroups B, R9, and M7 account for 45.1% of the gene pool, whereas northern-prevalent haplogroups A, D, G, N9, and M8 consist of 39.2%. Haplogroup distribution indicates that the Gelao bears signatures of southern populations and possesses some regional characters. In the PC map, Gelao clusters together with populations with Bai-Yue tribe origin as well as the local Han and the Miao. The results demonstrate the complexity of Gelao population and the data can well supplement the China mtDNA database. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

78650985826	Inland post-glacial dispersal in East Asia revealed by mitochondrial haplogroup M9a'b	Background: Archaeological studies have revealed a series of cultural changes around the Last Glacial Maximum in East Asia; whether these changes left any signatures in the gene pool of East Asians remains poorly indicated. To achieve deeper insights into the demographic history of modern humans in East Asia around the Last Glacial Maximum, we extensively analyzed mitochondrial DNA haplogroup M9a'b, a specific haplogroup that was suggested to have some potential for tracing the migration around the Last Glacial Maximum in East Eurasia.Results: A total of 837 M9a'b mitochondrial DNAs (583 from the literature, while the remaining 254 were newly collected in this study) pinpointed from over 28,000 subjects residing across East Eurasia were studied here. Fifty-nine representative samples were further selected for total mitochondrial DNA sequencing so we could better understand the phylogeny within M9a'b. Based on the updated phylogeny, an extensive phylogeographic analysis was carried out to reveal the differentiation of haplogroup M9a'b and to reconstruct the dispersal histories.Conclusions: Our results indicated that southern China and/or Southeast Asia likely served as the source of some post-Last Glacial Maximum dispersal(s). The detailed dissection of haplogroup M9a'b revealed the existence of an inland dispersal in mainland East Asia during the post-glacial period. It was this dispersal that expanded not only to western China but also to northeast India and the south Himalaya region. A similar phylogeographic distribution pattern was also observed for haplogroup F1c, thus substantiating our proposition. This inland post-glacial dispersal was in agreement with the spread of the Mesolithic culture originating in South China and northern Vietnam. © 2011 Peng et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

79953727827	Mitochondrial DNA evidence supports northeast Indian origin of the aboriginal Andamanese in the Late Paleolithic	In view of the geographically closest location to Andaman archipelago, Myanmar was suggested to be the origin place of aboriginal Andamanese. However, for lacking any genetic information from this region, which has prevented to resolve the dispute on whether the aboriginal Andamanese were originated from mainland India or Myanmar. To solve this question and better understand the origin of the aboriginal Andamanese, we screened for haplogroups M31 (from which Andaman-specific lineage M31a1 branched off) and M32 among 846 mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) sampled across Myanmar. As a result, two Myanmar individuals belonging to haplogroup M31 were identified, and completely sequencing the entire mtDNA genomes of both samples testified that the two M31 individuals observed in Myanmar were probably attributed to the recent gene flow from northeast India populations. Since no root lineages of haplogroup M31 or M32 were observed in Myanmar, it is unlikely that Myanmar may serve as the source place of the aboriginal Andamanese. To get further insight into the origin of this unique population, the detailed phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses were performed by including additional 7 new entire mtDNA genomes and 113 M31 mtDNAs pinpointed from South Asian populations, and the results suggested that Andaman-specific M31a1 could in fact trace its origin to northeast India. Time estimation results further indicated that the Andaman archipelago was likely settled by modern humans from northeast India via the land-bridge which connected the Andaman archipelago and Myanmar around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a scenario in well agreement with the evidence from linguistic and palaeoclimate studies. © 2011.

79955628171	Absence of association between mitochondrial DNA C150T polymorphism and longevity in a Han Chinese population	Human longevity has been associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) coding region polymorphisms, as well as the C150T polymorphism in the non-coding region in previous studies especially in Europeans. This study investigated the potential association between the mtDNA C150T polymorphism and longevity in a Han Chinese population. Leukocyte mtDNAs from two groups of a Han Chinese population living in Dujiangyan city of Sichuan province, including 556 longevous individuals (90-108. years-old) and 403 unrelated controls, were analyzed and mtDNA haplogroups were determined by sequencing control regions and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in coding regions. Our results did not show a universal association between the mitochondrial C150T polymorphism and longevity in this population. Even when mtDNA haplogroups defined by C150T and gender were taken into account, there was no significant association with longevity. In conclusion, the mtDNA C150T polymorphism could not present an accumulation in an elderly Han Chinese population. Previous association studies might have been influenced by nuclear DNA and/or environment factors. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

0036177751	Phylogeographic differentiation of mitochondrial DNA in Han Chinese	To characterize the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in Han Chinese from several provinces of China, we have sequenced the two hypervariable segments of the control region and the segment spanning nucleotide positions 10171-10659 of the coding region, and we have identified a number of specific coding-region mutations by direct sequencing or restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism tests. This allows us to define new haplogroups (clades of the mtDNA phylogeny) and to dissect the Han mtDNA pool on a phylogenetic basis, which is a prerequisite for any fine-grained phylogeographic analysis, the interpretation of ancient mtDNA, or future complete mtDNA sequencing efforts. Some of the haplogroups under study differ considerably in frequencies across different provinces. The southernmost provinces show more pronounced contrasts in their regional Han mtDNA pools than the central and northern provinces. These and other features of the geographical distribution of the mtDNA haplogroups observed in the Han Chinese make an initial Paleolithic colonization from south to north plausible but would suggest subsequent migration events in China that mainly proceeded from north to south and east to west. Lumping together all regional Han mtDNA pools into one fictive general mtDNA pool or choosing one or two regional Han populations to represent all Han Chinese is inappropriate for prehistoric considerations as well as for forensic purposes or medical disease studies.

79959592889	Uncovering the profile of somatic mtDNA mutations in Chinese Colorectal cancer patients	In the past decade, a high incidence of somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations has been observed, mostly based on a fraction of the molecule, in various cancerous tissues; nevertheless, some of them were queried due to problems in data quality. Obviously, without a comprehensive understanding of mtDNA mutational profile in the cancerous tissue of a specific patient, it is unlikely to disclose the genuine relationship between somatic mtDNA mutations and tumorigenesis. To achieve this objective, the most straightforward way is to directly compare the whole mtDNA genome variation among three tissues (namely, cancerous tissue, para-cancerous tissue, and distant normal tissue) from the same patient. Considering the fact that most of the previous studies on the role of mtDNA in colorectal tumor focused merely on the D-loop or partial segment of the molecule, in the current study we have collected three tissues (cancerous, para-cancerous and normal tissues) respectively recruited from 20 patients with colorectal tumor and completely sequenced the mitochondrial genome of each tissue. Our results reveal a relatively lower incidence of somatic mutations in these patients; intriguingly, all somatic mutations are in heteroplasmic status. Surprisingly, the observed somatic mutations are not restricted to cancer tissues, for the para-cancer tissues and distant normal tissues also harbor somatic mtDNA mutations with a lower frequency than cancerous tissues but higher than that observed in the general population. Our results suggest that somatic mtDNA mutations in cancerous tissues could not be simply explained as a consequence of tumorigenesis; meanwhile, the somatic mtDNA mutations in normal tissues might reflect an altered physiological environment in cancer patients. © 2011 Wang et al.

81055144937	Mitochondrial DNA haplogroup background affects LHON, but not suspected LHON, in Chinese patients	Recent studies have shown that mtDNA background could affect the clinical expression of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). We analyzed the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation of 304 Chinese patients with m.11778G>A (sample #1) and of 843 suspected LHON patients who lack the three primary mutations (sample #2) to discern mtDNA haplogroup effect on disease onset. Haplogroup frequencies in the patient group was compared to frequencies in the general Han Chinese population (n = 1,689; sample #3). The overall matrilineal composition of the suspected LHON population resembles that of the general Han Chinese population, suggesting no association with mtDNA haplogroup. In contrast, analysis of these LHON patients confirms mtDNA haplogroup effect on LHON. Specifically, the LHON sample significantly differs from the general Han Chinese and suspected LHON populations by harboring an extremely lower frequency of haplogroup R9, in particular of its main sub-haplogroup F (#1 vs. #3, P-value = 1.46×10

8444227060	Different matrilineal contributions to genetic structure of ethnic groups in the Silk Road region in China	Previous studies have shown that there were extensive genetic admixtures in the Silk Road region. In the present study, we analyzed 252 mtDNAs of five ethnic groups (Uygur, Uzbek, Kazak, Mongolian, and Hui) from Xinjiang Province, China (through which the Silk Road once ran) together with some reported data from the adjacent regions in Central Asia. In a simple way, we classified the mtDNAs into different haplogroups (monophyletic clades in the rooted mtDNA tree) according to the available phylogenetic information and compared their frequencies to show the differences among the matrilineal genetic structures of these populations with different demographic histories. With the exception of eight unassigned M*, N*, and R* mtDNAs, all the mtDNA types identified here belonged to defined subhaplogroups of haplogroups M and N (including R) and consisted of subsets of both the eastern and western Eurasian pools, thus providing direct evidence supporting the suggestion that Central Asia is the location of genetic admixture of the East and the West. Although our samples were from the same geographic location, a decreasing tendency of the western Eurasian-specific haplogroup frequency was observed, with the highest frequency present in Uygur (42.6%) and Uzbek (41.4%) samples, followed by Kazak (30.2%), Mongolian (14.3%), and Hui (6.7%). No western Eurasian type was found in Han Chinese samples from the same place. The frequencies of the eastern Eurasian-specific haplogroups also varied in these samples. Combined with the historical records, ethno-origin, migratory history, and marriage customs might play different roles in shaping the matrilineal genetic structure of different ethnic populations residing in this region.

84860305689	Revisiting the role of the Himalayas in peopling Nepal: Insights from mitochondrial genomes	Himalayas was believed to be a formidably geographical barrier between South and East Asia. The observed high frequency of the East Eurasian paternal lineages in Nepal led some researchers to suggest that these lineages were introduced into Nepal from Tibet directly; however, it is also possible that the East Eurasian genetic components might trace their origins to northeast India where abundant East Eurasian maternal lineages have been detected. To trace the origin of the Nepalese maternal genetic components, especially those of East Eurasian ancestry, and then to better understand the role of the Himalayas in peopling Nepal, we have studied the matenal genetic composition extensively, especially the East Eurasian lineages, in Nepalese and its surrounding populations. Our results revealed the closer affinity between the Nepalese and the Tibetans, specifically, the Nepalese lineages of the East Eurasian ancestry generally are phylogenetically closer with the ones from Tibet, albeit a few mitochondrial DNA haplotypes, likely resulted from recent gene flow, were shared between the Nepalese and northeast Indians. It seems that Tibet was most likely to be the homeland for most of the East Eurasian in the Nepalese. Taking into account the previous observation on Y chromosome, now it is convincing that bearer of the East Eurasian genetic components had entered Nepal across the Himalayas around 6 kilo years ago (kya), a scenario in good agreement with the previous results from linguistics and archeology. © 2012 The Japan Society of Human Genetics All rights reserved.

84863365961	Deciphering the signature of selective constraints on cancerous mitochondrial genome	In accordance with the hypothesis that cancer formation is a process of somatic evolution driven by natural selection, signature of positive selection has been detected on a number of cancer-related nuclear genes. It remains, however, controversial whether a similar selective pressure has also acted on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), a small molecule in mitochondrion that may play an important role in tumorigenesis by altering oxidative phosphorylation. To better understand the mutational pattern on cancerous mtDNA and decipher the genetic signature left by natural selection, a total of 186 entire mitochondrial genomes of cancerous and adjacent normal tissues from 93 esophageal cancer patients were obtained and extensively studied. Our results revealed that the observed mutational pattern on the cancerous mtDNAs might be best explained as relaxation of negative selection. Taking into account an additional 1,235 cancerous (nearly) complete mtDNA sequences retrieved from the literature, our results suggested that the relaxed selective pressure was the most likely explanation for the accumulation of mtDNA variation in different types of cancer. This notion is in good agreement with the observation that aerobic glycolysis, instead of mitochondrial respiration, plays the key role in generating energy in cancer cells. Furthermore, our study provided solid evidence demonstrating that problems in some of the published cancerous mtDNA data adequately explained the previously contradictory conclusions about the selective pressure on cancer mtDNA, thus serving as a paradigm emphasizing the importance of data quality in affecting our understanding on the role of mtDNA in tumorigenesis. ©2011 The Author.

84865184872	Toward a mtDNA locus-specific mutation database using the LOVD platform	The Human Variome Project (HVP) is a global effort to collect and curate all human genetic variation affecting health. Mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are an important cause of neurogenetic disease in humans; however, identification of the pathogenic mutations responsible can be problematic. In this article, we provide explanations as to why and suggest how such difficulties might be overcome. We put forward a case in support of a new Locus Specific Mutation Database (LSDB) implemented using the Leiden Open-source Variation Database (LOVD) system that will not only list primary mutations, but also present the evidence supporting their role in disease. Critically, we feel that this new database should have the capacity to store information on the observed phenotypes alongside the genetic variation, thereby facilitating our understanding of the complex and variable presentation of mtDNA disease. LOVD supports fast queries of both seen and hidden data and allows storage of sequence variants from high-throughput sequence analysis. The LOVD platform will allow construction of a secure mtDNA database; one that can fully utilize currently available data, as well as that being generated by high-throughput sequencing, to link genotype with phenotype enhancing our understanding of mitochondrial disease, with a view to providing better prognostic information. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The previously healthy boy progressively presented with blepharoptosis, weakness, epilepsy and motor regression at age 6 years. Elevated blood lactate and pyruvate were observed. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed symmetrical lesions in the basal ganglia. Leigh syndrome was thus confirmed. The protein from the mitochondria and genomic DNA of the boy and his parents was collected from peripheral blood leucocytes for the activity test for mitochondrial complex I to V and genetic analysis. The results showed the activity of complex I (33.1 nmol /min in 1 milligram mitochondrial protein) was lower than normal reference value (44.0 ± 5.4 nmol /min in 1 milligram mitochondrial protein). The ratio of complex I to citrate synthase (19.8%) was also lower than normal reference value (48% ± 11%). The activities of complexes ii to V were normal. 1019IT > C mutation in ND3 gene of mitochondria was identified in the boy. 1019IT > C mutation and complex I deficiency were not detected in his parents. At present, he is 16 years old, and of normal intelligence with spastic paralysis in both lower extremities after treatment. It is concluded that a Chinese boy with isolated complex I deficiency due to 10191T > C mutation in ND3 gene was firstly diagnosed by peripheral leukocytes mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme assay and gene analysis. This study can provide clinical data for the nosogenesis of Leigh syndrome.

0036820765	Mitochondrial DNA 5178A polymorphism and longevity	Previous studies have shown that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 5178 adenine/cytosine (5178A) polymorphism, which is one of the haplogroup-specific mutations for mtDNA haplogroup D, was apparently assoiated with aging and longevity in humans. We genotyped the 5178A in 293 samples representing three age groups (Old, n=95; Young, n=103; and Infant, n=95) from Yunnan Province, China. The distribution frequency of the 5178A in the Old samples (16.84%) is slightly higher than in those of the young (13.59%) and Infant (15.795), but the frequency difference between the age groups is far from being statistically significant (P>0.05). Our results fail to support the suggestion of association between mtDNA 5178A (or haplogroup D) and longevity. © Springer-Verlag 2002.

0037326926	Reconstructing the evolutionary history of China: A caveat about inferences drawn from ancient DNA	The decipherment of the meager information provided by short fragments of ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is notoriously difficult but is regarded as a most promising way toward reconstructing the past from the genetic perspective. By haplogroup-specific hypervariable segment (HVS) motif search and matching or near-matching with available modern data sets, most of the ancient mtDNAs can be tentatively assigned to haplogroups, which are often subcontinent specific. Further typing for mtDNA haplogroup-diagnostic coding region polymorphisms, however, is indispensable for establishing the geographic/genetic affinities of ancient samples with less ambiguity. In the present study, we sequenced a fragment (∼982 bp) of the mtDNA control region in 76 Han individuals from Taian, Shandong, China, and we combined these data with previously reported samples from Zibo and Qingdao, Shandong. The reanalysis of two previously published ancient mtDNA population data sets from Linzi (same province) then indicates that the ancient populations had features in common with the modern populations from south China rather than any specific affinity to the European mtDNA pool. Our results highlight that ancient mtDNA data obtained under different sampling schemes and subject to potential contamination can easily create the impression of drastic spatiotemporal changes in the genetic structure of a regional population during the past few thousand years if inappropriate methods of data analysis are employed.

To address this issue, we extensively studied and compared the haplogroup composition of a sample of 171 Chinese LS patients with that of 1597 controls. Our results show that haplogroup Y may increase the risk of LS in Chinese by 2.867 fold (95% CI = 1.135-7.240, P=0.020). Haplogroup B5 has also this trend (1.737 fold, 95% CI = 0.961-3.139), but with a borderline P-value (P=0.065). Both haplogroups belong to macro-haplogroup N and share a common reverse mutation on nucleotide position 10398 (A10398G). In fact, the combined haplogroup N with 10398G is also associated with an increased risk for LS (OR = 1.882, 95% CI = 1.134-3.124, P=0.013). © 2012.

84872850915	Correlation of telomere length shortening with TP53 somatic mutations, polymorphisms and allelic loss in breast tumors and esophageal cancer	Genomic instability caused by telomere erosion is an important mechanism of tumorigenesis. p53 plays a key role in cellular senescence and/or apoptosis associated with telomere erosion which positions p53 as a guard against tumorigenesis. The present study was undertaken to investigate the potential interactions between p53 functional mutations, polymorphisms, allelic loss and telomere erosion in 126 breast tumor patients and 68 esophageal cancer patients. Telomere length (TL) was measured by real-time quantitative PCR. Somatic mutations, polymorphisms and allelic loss in the TP53 gene were detected by direct sequencing of both tumor and normal tissue samples. Our results showed that telomeres were significantly shorter in tumors with somatic p53 mutations compared with tumors with wild-type p53 in both breast tumors (P=0.007) and esophageal cancer (P=0.001). Telomeres of patients with minor genotype CC of rs12951053 and GG of rs1042522 were significantly shorter compared to patients with other genotypes of this single nucleotide polymorphism in esophageal cancer tissue. Furthermore, TP53 allelic loss was detected and significantly associated with somatic mutations in both types of tumor tissues. These findings suggest that somatic p53 mutations, rs12951053 genotype CC and rs1042522 genotype GG contribute to erosion of telomeres, and TP53 allelic loss may be one of the representations of chromosomal instability caused by telomere erosion combined with somatic p53 mutations. These results support that the TP53 gene has a strong interaction with TL erosion in tumorigenesis.

84874000860	Chicken domestication: An updated perspective based on mitochondrial genomes	Domestic chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) fulfill various roles ranging from food and entertainment to religion and ornamentation. To survey its genetic diversity and trace the history of domestication, we investigated a total of 4938 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments including 2843 previously published and 2095 de novo units from 2044 domestic chickens and 51 red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). To obtain the highest possible level of molecular resolution, 50 representative samples were further selected for total mtDNA genome sequencing. A fine-gained mtDNA phylogeny was investigated by defining haplogroups A-I and W-Z. Common haplogroups A-G were shared by domestic chickens and red junglefowl. Rare haplogroups H-I and W-Z were specific to domestic chickens and red junglefowl, respectively. We re-evaluated the global mtDNA profiles of chickens. The geographic distribution for each of major haplogroups was examined. Our results revealed new complexities of history in chicken domestication because in the phylogeny lineages from the red junglefowl were mingled with those of the domestic chickens. Several local domestication events in South Asia, Southwest China and Southeast Asia were identified. The assessment of chicken mtDNA data also facilitated our understanding about the Austronesian settlement in the Pacific. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

0041075202	Mitochondrial DNA sequence variations of Shui ethnic group	The mtDNA hypervariable segment I sequences (HVS I) were sequenced in 64 Shuis from Guizhou Province. 73 sites were polymorphic in the 495bp fragment that sequenced, identified 48 different haplotypes. Phylogenetic analysis of the haplotypes suggested that there were some ancestral haplotypes in current Shuis, and these haplotypes were also present in Eurasia populations as well as in other ethnic groups. Demographic analysis of the Shuis demonstrated a unimodal distribution that is typical for a population undergone expansion in the past and with a high Tau value, which suggested that the Shui group might be a ancestral population. Combined with the analysis of the reported data, the Shui ethnic group showed a generally similar genetic component with the Zhuang from Guangxi, but it is also different from these typical south populations as Zhuang, Cantonese.

0042387705	Phylogeny of East Asian mitochondrial DNA lineages inferred from complete sequences	The now-emerging mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) population genomics provides information for reconstructing a well-resolved mtDNA phylogeny and for discerning the phylogenetic status of the subcontinentally specific haplogroups. Although several major East Asian mtDNA haplogroups have been identified in studies elsewhere, some of the most basal haplogroups, as well as numerous minor subhaplogroups, were not yet determined or fully characterized. To fill the lacunae, we selected 48 mtDNAs from >2,000 samples across China for complete sequencing that cover virtually all (sub)haplogroups discernible to date in East Asia. This East Asian mtDNA phylogeny can henceforth serve as a solid basis for phylogeographic analyses of mtDNAs, as well as for studies of mitochondrial diseases in East and Southeast Asia.

0141896373	Can the occurrence of rare insertion/deletion polymorphisms in human mtDNA be verified from phylogeny?	Due to its specific characteristics, such as maternal inheritance and absence of recombination, each mtDNA belongs to certain monophyletic clade in the rooted mtDNA tree (haplogroup) according to the mutations it harbors. Rare mutation (excluding parallel mutation) occurring at multiple times in different haplogroups could thus be a potential reading error according to the mtDNA phylogeny. This experience has been widely used in double-checking the credibility of the rare mutations in human mtDNA sequences. However, no test has been performed so far for the feasibility of applying this strategy to the rare insertion/deletion (indel) events in mtDNA sequences. In this study, we attempted to relate the rare indels in mtDNAs to their haplogroup status in a total of 2352 individuals from 50 populations in China. Our results show that the insertion of A at position 16259 is restricted to a subclade of haplogroup C and can be verified. The other indel polymorphisms, which occur in the repeat of the deleted or inserted nucleotide(s), may not be distinguished from phantom mutations from a phylogenetic point of view. Independently and multiply sequencing the fragment with the indel is the best and the most reliable way for confirmation.

0141955280	Mitochondrial DNA sequence polymorphisms of five ethnic populations from northern China	To study the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphisms in a total of 232 individuals from five ethnic populations (Daur, n=45; Ewenki, n=47; Korean, n=48; Mongolian, n=48; Oroqen, n=44) in northern China, we analyzed the control region sequences and typed for a number of characteristic mutations in coding regions (especially the region 14576-16047), by direct sequencing or restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. With the exception of 14 individuals belonging to the European-specific haplogroups R2, H, J, and T, the mtDNAs considered could be assigned into the East Asian-specific haplogroups described recently. The polymorphisms in cytochrome b sequence were found to be very informative for defining or supporting the haplogroups status of East Asian mtDNAs in addition to the reported regions 10171-10659 and 14055-14590 in our previous study. The haplogroup distribution frequencies varied in the five ethnic populations, but in general they all harbored a large amount of north-prevalent haplogroups, such as D, G, C, and Z, and thus were in agreement with their ethnohistory of northern origin. The two populations (Ewenki arid Oroqen) with small population census also show concordant features in their matrilineal genetic structures, with lower genetic diversities observed. © Springer-Verlag 2003.

0141965402	Identification of Native American founder mtDNAs through the analysis of complete mtDNA sequences: Some caveats	In this study, a detailed analysis of both previously published and new data was performed to determine whether complete, or almost complete, mtDNA sequences can resolve the long-debated issue of which Asian mtDNAs were founder sequences for the Native American mtDNA pool. Unfortunately, we now know that coding region data and their analysis are not without problems. To obtain and report reasonably correct sequences does not seem to be a trivial task, and to discriminate between Asian and Native American mtDNA ancestries may be more complex than previously believed. It is essential to take into account the effects of mutational hot spots in both the control and coding regions, so that the number of apparent Native American mtDNA founder sequences is not erroneously inflated. As we report here, a careful analysis of all available data indicates that there is very little evidence that more than five founder mtDNA sequences entered Beringia before the Last Glacial Maximum and left their traces in the current Native American mtDNA pool.

0346096530	Mitochondrial DNA Control Region and Cytochrome b Sequence Variation in the Genus Mystacoleucus Günther (Pisces: Cyprinidae: Barbinae) from China	Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) hypervariable segment I sequences (HVSI, 471 bp) of the control region and partial cytochrome b sequences (Cytb, 403 bp) were analyzed in three tentative species of the genus Mystacoleucus in China (M. chilopterus, M. marginatus, and M. lepturus). Not more than two mutations were found in both the HVSI and Cytb fragments among the samples from M. chilopterus and M. marginatus. However, M. lepturus differed from each of them by at least 25 mutations in Cytb and 51 mutations in HVSI. Moreover, the HVSI sequence variation within M. lepturus was larger than that between M. chilopterus and M. marginatus. Given that M. chilopterus and M. marginatus are very similar in morphology, it is reasonable to consider M. chilopterus and M. marginatus as conspecific. Our results also suggest a recent radiation of M. marginatus from downstream to upstream of the Lancangjiang (Mekong) River.

84890895807	Comprehensive analysis of common and rare mitochondrial DNA variants in elite Japanese athletes: A case-control study	The purpose of the present study was to identify mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphisms and rare variants that associate with elite Japanese athletic status. Subjects comprised 185 elite Japanese athletes who had represented Japan at international competitions (that is, 100 endurance/middle-power athletes: EMA; 85 sprint/power athletes: SPA) and 672 Japanese controls (CON). The entire mtDNA sequences (16 569 bp) were analyzed by direct sequencing. Nucleotide variants were detected at 1488 sites in the 857 entire mtDNA sequences. A total of 311 variants were polymorphisms (minor allele frequency≥1% in CON), and the frequencies of these polymorphisms were compared among the three groups. The EMA displayed excess of seven polymorphisms, including subhaplogroup D4e2- and D4g-specific polymorphisms, compared with CON (P<0.05), whereas SPA displayed excess of three polymorphisms and dearth of nine polymorphisms, including haplogroup G- and subhaplogroup G2a-specific polymorphisms, compared with CON (P<0.05). The frequencies of 10 polymorphisms, including haplogroup G- and subhaplogroup G2a-specific polymorphisms, were different between EMA and SPA (P<0.05): although none of these polymorphisms differed significantly between groups after correcting for multiple comparison (false discovery rate q-value≥0.05). The number of rare variants in the 12S ribosomal RNA and NADH dehydrogenase subunit I genes were also higher in SPA than in CON (P<0.05). Analysis of the entire mtDNA of elite Japanese athletes revealed several haplogroup- and subhaplogroup-specific polymorphisms to be potentially associated with elite Japanese athletic status. © 2013 The Japan Society of Human Genetics All rights reserved 1434-5161/13.

84891372852	Absence of A673T variant in APP gene indicates an alternative protective mechanism contributing to longevity in Chinese individuals	A673T, a rare variant in the amyloid-β precursor protein gene, shows a protective potential against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related cognitive decline in an Icelandic population. Although A673T was observed independently in a Finnish population, this variant was absent in 8721 Asian subjects. The conflicting observations suggest that the contribution of A673T may be confined to Europeans and Americans rather than Asians. Nevertheless, A673T confers a protective function against AD and thus may be observed only in longevity subjects; thus it is not surprising to see its absence when the general populations or the patient cohorts were considered. To test whether the A673T contributes to the Chinese population, 1237 healthy longevity subjects (mean age 96.9 years) and 1404 matched younger controls (mean age 44.2 years) were genotyped for the variant. Our study failed to observe this variant in either the longevity subjects or the controls. Given the previous observation from Asians, our results suggest that the A673T variant is not involved in longevity in Chinese individuals; some other protective mechanisms may contribute to a lower incidence of AD in Chinese nonagenerians and centenarians. © 2014 Elsevier Inc..

84892589668	Mitochondrial DNA content contributes to climate adaptation using chinese populations as a model	Maintaining a balance between ATP synthesis and heat generation is crucial for adapting to changes in climate. Variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes 13 subunits of the respiratory chain complexes, may contribute to climate adaptation by regulating thermogenesis and the use of bioenergy. However, studies looking for a relationship between mtDNA haplogroups and climate have obtained mixed results, leaving unresolved the role of mtDNA in climate adaptation. Since mtDNA content can regulate human bioenergy processes and is known to influence many physiological traits and diseases, it is possible that mtDNA content contributes to climate adaptation in human populations. Here, we analyze the distribution of mtDNA content among 27 Chinese ethnic populations residing across China and find a significant association between mtDNA content and climate, with northern populations having significantly higher mtDNA content than southern populations. Functional studies have shown that high mtDNA content correlates with an increase in the expression of energy metabolism enzymes, which may accelerate thermogenesis. This suggests that the significantly higher mtDNA content observed in northern populations may confer a selective advantage in adapting to colder northern climates © 2013 Cheng et al.

84903367975	Mitochondrial DNA content contributes to healthy aging in Chinese: A study from nonagenarians and centenarians	Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content plays an important role in energy production and sustaining normal physiological function. A decline in the mtDNA content and subsequent dysfunction cause various senile diseases, with decreasing mtDNA content observed in the elderly individuals with age-related diseases. In contrast, the oldest old individuals, for example, centenarians, have a delayed or reduced prevalence of these diseases, suggesting centenarians may have a different pattern of the mtDNA content, enabling them to keep normal mitochondrial functions to help delay or escape senile diseases. To test this hypothesis, a total of 961 subjects, consisting of 424 longevity subjects and 537 younger control subjects from Hainan and Sichuan provinces of China, were recruited for this study. The mtDNA content was found to be inversely associated with age among the age of group 40-70 years. Surprisingly, no reduction of mtDNA content was observed in nonagenarians and centenarians; instead, these oldest old showed a significant increase than the elderly people aged between 50 and 70 years. The results suggest the higher mtDNA content may convey a beneficial effect to the longevity of people through assuring sufficient energy supply. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84916223503	The reduction of vascular disease risk mutations contributes to longevity in the Chinese population	Aim: Genetic factors play important roles in determining human lifespan. Although some "longevity genes" have been identified to be implicated in human longevity, many disease-associated variants were also observed in the long-lived individuals. The oldest old and their offspring usually have a lower prevalence of age-related diseases, which is likely attributed to a reduction or an absence of disease risk variants. Methods and results: To test this hypothesis, 23 disease risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), identified by previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs), were selected and genotyped in 1074 samples consisting of 574 longevity subjects (over 90. years old) and 500 younger controls. Our results revealed that 5 SNPs (rs2144300, rs1864163, rs2200733, rs1967017, and rs7193343) displayed significantly lower allelic frequencies and odds ratios (ORs) in the longevity group than that in the control group. The frequencies of homozygous mutation genotypes and corresponding ORs of the rs1864163, rs2200733, rs127430, rs1967017, and rs12413409 were lower in the longevity subjects. Interestingly, most of the abovementioned SNPs convey susceptibility to cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of deaths in old adults but shows a much lower incidence in the longevity individuals and their offspring. Conclusion: Taking into account the observation that the longevity subjects and their offspring have lower rate of cardiovascular mortality, it is then most plausible that the lack of disease risk variants, especially the CVD, is a genetic contributor to longevity in the Chinese population.

84919712198	Evaluating the susceptibility of mitochondrial DNA germline mutations in Chinese cancer patients	It has been suggested that impairment of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a common character in cancer cells, urging attention to variation on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that encodes 13 units of the OXPHOS. However, most of mtDNA somatic mutations in cancer were suggested to result from the relaxed functional constrains and thus the byproducts of tumorigenesis. MtDNA germline mutations present not only in the cancer tissue but also in the normal tissue. However, it remains unclear whether the cancerous mtDNA germline mutations suffered similar selective constraints as the somatic mutations did. To address this question, we collected 153 whole mitochondrial genomes (including 20 newly obtained genomes in this study) from the normal tissues of cancer patients and compared with a number of 561 whole mtDNA sequences from the general population in China. Different from the observations on cancerous mtDNA somatic mutations, our results revealed that the germline mutations showed no significant difference between the cancer patients and the general population in either the sub-haplogroup composition, mutation pattern or the potential pathogenicity of the private mutations. It then seems that regulation on cellular OXPHOS level, triggered by mtDNA variation to some extent, exerts little influence on the susceptibility of cancer, which echoes the opinion that aerobic glycolysis, not mitochondrial respiration, plays the key role in generating energy in cancer cells, thus suggesting the role of most mtDNA mutations in cancer likely being overestimated.

84920273003	Association of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) polymorphism with longevity in Chinese nonagenarians and centenarians	Human lifespan is determined greatly by genetic factors and some investigations have identified putative genes implicated in human longevity. Although some genetic loci have been associated with longevity, most of them are difficult to replicate due to ethnic differences. In this study, we analyzed the association of 18 reported gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with longevity in 1075 samples consisting of 567 nonagenarians/centenarians and 508 younger controls using the GenomeLab SNPstream Genotyping System. Our results confirm the association of the forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) variant (rs13217795) and the ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM) variant (rs189037) genotypes with longevity (p=0.0075 and p=0.026, using the codominant model and recessive model, respectively). Of note is that we first revealed the association of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) gene polymorphism rs11977526 with longevity in Chinese nonagenarians/centenarians (p=0.033 using the dominant model and p=0.035 using the overdominant model). The FOXO3 and IGFBP-3 form important parts of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway (IGF-1) implicated in human longevity, and the ATM gene is involved in sensing DNA damage and reducing oxidative stress, therefore our results highlight the important roles of insulin pathway and oxidative stress in the longevity in the Chinese population.

84919771670	Reappraising the relationship between mitochondrial DNA Variant m.16189T>C and Type 2 diabetes mellitus in east asian populations	The role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variant 16189T>C in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains hotly debated in the past decade. If mutation 16189T>C indeed posed a risk to T2DM, as echoed by some recent studies, correlation between this mutation and disease should be observed when carrying out a systematical study using data and samples collected in a large geographic region in China. To test this hypothesis, we first performed a linear regression analysis between the prevalence of T2DM and the allele frequency of 16189C variant in 10 East Asian populations, and further genotyped this variant in two casecontrol cohorts from west Han Chinese (Kunming and Xining). Linear regression analysis showed that no significant correlation was observed (r2=0.211, P=0.181), and the genotyping results indicated that the m.16189T>C frequency difference between case and control was not significant in either populations (P=0.38 and 0.89 for Kunming and Xining, respectively). Matrilineal backgrounds constitution (in terms of haplogroups) analysis generated a similar haplogroup distribution in both populations (P>0.1). All results failed to substantiate that m.16189T>C may play an active role in the development of T2DM in East Asian populations.

84920501363	The MNS16A polymorphism in the TERT gene in peri-centenarians from the Han Chinese population	MNS16A, a variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism in the TERT gene, has been suggested to regulate telomerase activity. As telomerase activity has been reported to be related to life-span, we hypothesized that this polymorphism might affect human longevity by controlling the length of the telomere. To test this hypothesis, we collected 446 unrelated pericentenarian individuals (age⩾90, mean 94.45±3.45 years) and 332 normal controls (age 22–53, mean 35.0±12.0 years) from Dujiangyan, Sichuan, China. We typed the MNS16A polymorphism in both groups, and compared the allele and genotype frequencies between the peri-centenarian and control groups using the chi-squared test. There was no significant difference between the peri-centenarian and control groups. Thus, the MNS16A polymorphism in TERT might not influence human life-span, at least in the Han Chinese population studied here.
