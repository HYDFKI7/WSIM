0032022574	Improving job-shop schedules through critical pairwise exchanges	In this paper, we consider a job-shop scheduling problem. The criterion to be minimized is the makespan. To reach this goal, we propose a heuristic algorithm which gradually improves a given schedule by reversing the order in which some tasks are performed on machines. The job-shop scheduling problem being modelled as a disjunctive graph, reversing the order of two consecutive tasks which are performed on a given machine is equivalent to reversing the direction of a critical disjunctive arc. The important fact is that, due to the results proposed in this paper, we are able to choose the critical disjunctive arc to be reversed such that the makespan decreases at each iteration if the critical path is unique; otherwise, at least as many iterations as the number of critical paths are needed. This approach is simple and easy to implement.

In the last decade, substantial research efforts have been made on the surveillance and diagnosis systems for different types of equipment, with the approach of integrating information technologies and intelligent computing methods. This paper presents the conceptual design of a distributed information system of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis for a growing number of gas turbine-based power generation systems. Each individual information system that monitors a specific gas turbine system, locally deployed in a power plant, is linked to another information system, deployed at the manufacturer's site, which oversees all the gas turbine systems in parallel. The systems are constructed on the basis of COM components, which are conceptually separated into three tiers. Subsequently, this paper proceeds to present a generic business domain model with components encapsulating physical entities of interest. Finally, this paper addresses the interactions among components, which considerably affect the performance of the system including efficiency and effectiveness.

Practitioners in manufacturing industries have for a long time feel the increasing need of integrating engineering applications, in order to accelerate product development paces and improve design qualities. Integrating engineering applications used in the multiple engineering disciplines has to cope with a number of challenges. This paper focuses on one of the critical issues: parameter mapping and data transformation, which is of pivotal importance to integrating engineering applications. Design parameter mapping provides a consistent approach to data extraction, storage, display and manipulation among different data sources.

In this paper, an architecture that encompasses view models, flow models and O-O models is developed, which gradually specifies the evolving design details through successive lifecycle stages of process manufacturing systems. In the architecture, products are distinctly modelled to reflect the impact of product data and to facilitate the development of customized products. A combination of object and agent concepts is adopted for building the models of process manufacturing systems. System constituent elements are respectively modelled as two types of entities: Namely the objects and agents. Objects are used to describe the passive constituent entities that possess no autonomy and conduct no functions, whereas agents are used to model the active entities that possess decision-making capabilities and perform operations on objects. One important advantage of the architecture is that it provides executable models at the implementation stage, which can be directly converted into application programs coded in object-oriented languages. Some models of the architecture are further discussed in depth and an information infrastructure based on CORBA standards is proposed for integrating the distributed data sources.

84864564598	AutoAssem: An automated assembly planning system for complex products	To automate assembly planning for complex products such as aircraft components, an assembly planning and simulation system called AutoAssem has been developed. In this paper, its system architecture is presented; the main components and the key technologies in each component are discussed. The core functions of the system that have been focused include Digital Assembly Modeling, Assembly Sequence Planning (ASP), Path Planning, Visualization, and Simulation. In contrast to existing assembly planning systems, one of the novelties of the system is it allows the assembly plans be automatically generated from a CAD assembly model with minimal manual interventions. Within the system, new methodologies have been developed to: (i) create Assembly Relationship Matrices; (ii) plan assembly sequences; (iii) generate assembly paths; and (iv) visualize and simulate assembly plans. To illustrate the application of the system, the assembly of a worm gear reducer is used as an example throughout this paper for demonstration purpose.

84869171273	3D mesh based isosurface gradient extraction algorithm	In order to avoid the ambiguity of isosurface extraction process in 3D mesh, an isosurface extraction algorithm based on gradient in 3D data space was proposed. In this method, contour points were calculated on the surface of the voxel based on gradient step by step. The outline of the isosurface was drew to make sure that the isosurface was concave or convex by adding contour points inside the voxel. The map-Delaunay method was proposed to get triangles of the isosurface in 2D. The step and merge-threshold were used to control the quantity of triangles to decrease the cost of storage. The experiment results showed that with this algorithm, the accurate contour was extracted just for once and the shortcomings of Marching Cubes algorithm was overcome. The isosurface in the voxel could be extracted exactly. The accuracy of the isosurface was ensured, and the cost of storage was reduced by changing the parameters.

84872153947	Assembly sequence planning based on max-min ant colony system	An assembly sequence planning (ASP) method that combined the advantages of ant colony system (ACS) and max-min ant system (MMAS) is proposed. Several characteristics that adopted in the literatures of the ASP based on ant colony optimization (ACO) in the last decade are reviewed and compared, such as the optimization criterions, the assembly information models, the numbers of components in cases study. To identify good sequences more obviously, five optimization criterions are automatically quantified, including directionality, parallelism, continuity, stability and auxiliary stroke, and integrated into the multi-objective heuristic and fitness functions of ACO. To improve the search capability for the global best sequence based on geometric assembly feasibility, several measures are presented from the aspects of determining ant number, defining max-min pheromone, and the mechanisms of performance appraisal for initial components allocation and parallel components group enforcement. Then the ASP algorithm based on max-min ant colony system (MMACS) is proposed. An assembly planning system "AutoAssem" is developed based on Siemens NX platform, and the actual effectiveness of each optimization measure is testified through case study of a valve. Compared with priority rules screening, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization, the superiority of the algorithm in executive efficiency and sequence performance are analyzed. ©2012 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

84888638596	Method for discriminating geometric feasibility in assembly planning based on extended and turning interference matrix	Geometric feasibility (GF) of components is the precondition for assembly/disassembly sequence planning (ASP/DSP), and interference matrix is an important assembly relation model for GF discrimination. Extended interference matrix (EIM) is proposed to determine GF in the slanting directions, whose descriptive directions are extended to axes of a local coordinate system in each component. Turning interference matrix (TIM) is proposed to analyze the GF of the component that must be assembled with a multidirectional path, with the structure compact enough to describe the interference information from a turning point. The methods for acquiring EIM and TIM rapidly and automatically are proposed, including the stepping precise detection, the rough detection, and the accelerated detection based on bounding box. The measures for restraining static hard interference automatically are studied. An algorithm for discriminating GF comprehensively based on EIM and TIM is then presented. An ASP system AutoAssem is developed, with two instances illustrating the effectiveness of each interference detection method. EIM and TIM are testified to enrich the variety and variability of assembly directions, which provide great universality to the GF determination of large-scale assemblies, together with an effective foundation to ASP/DSP algorithms. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London.

84888641475	A max-min ant colony system for assembly sequence planning	An improved ant colony optimization (ACO)-based assembly sequence planning (ASP) method for complex products that combines the advantages of ant colony system (ACS) and max-min ant system (MMAS) and integrates some optimization measures is proposed. The optimization criteria, assembly information models, and components number in case study that reported in the literatures of ACO-based ASP during the past 10 years are reviewed and compared. To reduce tedious manual input of parameters and identify the best sequence easily, the optimization criteria such as directionality, parallelism, continuity, stability, and auxiliary stroke are automatically quantified and integrated into the multi-objective heuristic and fitness functions. On the precondition of geometric feasibility based on interference matrix, several strategies of ACS and MMAS are combined in a max-min ant colony system (MMACS) to improve the convergence speed and sequence quality. Several optimization measures are integrated into the system, among which the performance appraisal method transfers the computing resource from the worst ant to the better one, and the group method makes up the deficiency of solely depending on heuristic searching for all parallel parts in each group. An assembly planning system "AutoAssem" is developed based on Siemens NX, and the effectiveness of each optimization measure is testified through case study. Compared with the methods of priority rules screening, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization, MMACS is verified to have superiority in efficiency and sequence performance. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.

84897404861	Insights from developing a multidisciplinary design and analysis environment	This paper presents technical insights gained from developing a multidisciplinary design and analysis (MDA) environment, which proficiently integrates, coordinates and controls disciplinary software packages, data sources, and human factors. The MDA environment cost-effectively boosters global optimization of product design problems by means of integrating and coordinating engineering resources, implementing optimization approaches, and reconciling contradicting disciplinary objectives. This paper begins with depicting a multidisciplinary view of a generic complex engineering system, which sets the basic tone of developments of the environment. Subsequently, this paper proceeds with descriptions of information techniques or software utilities that constitute core competencies of the MDA environment. Firstly, software components based integration techniques are implemented to enhance interoperability among heterogeneous engineering applications and data sources. The integration techniques have viably overcome engineering inefficiencies, system incongruences, and information inconsistencies caused by 'automation islands' problems. Secondly, project and workflow management utilities are developed to support collaborative design, which allows better utilization of engineering resources and effective coordination. Thirdly, tailored geometry modeling techniques are implemented to enable expeditious representations of shape variations in congruence with outcomes of multiphysics analyses and simulations. Fourthly, optimization strategies, sensitivity analysis, surrogate models and searching algorithms are coded to enable global engineering optimization.

84900815294	IoT and cloud computing in automation of assembly modeling systems	After the technologies of integrated circuits, personal computers, and the Internet, Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest information technology (IT) that is radically changing business paradigms. However, IoT's influence in the manufacturing sector has yet been fully explored. On the other hand, existing computer-aided software tools are experiencing a bottleneck in dealing with complexity, dynamics, and uncertainties in their applications of modern enterprises. It is argued that the adoption of IoT and cloud computing in enterprise systems (ESs) would overcome the bottleneck. In this paper, the challenges in generating assembly plans of complex products are discussed. IoT and cloud computing are proposed to help a conventional assembly modeling system evolve into an advanced system, which is capable to deal with complexity and changes automatically. To achieve this goal, an assembly modeling system is automated, and the proposed system includes the following innovations: 1) the modularized architecture to make the system robust, reliable, flexible, and expandable; 2) the integrated object-oriented templates to facilitate interfaces and reuses of system components; and 3) the automated algorithms to retrieve relational assembly matrices for assembly planning. Assembly modeling for aircraft engines is used as examples to illustrate the system effectiveness. © 2012 IEEE.

84902345131	Integration of product design process and task management for product data management systems	Product design is an evolving process which is characterized with creativity and uncertainty. The task management in this process is different from traditional ones because it involves more specific factors such as user specifications, product design specifications, reengineering, design process, and design data. In this article, we aim to analyze product design process with the viewpoint of project management and task management, and propose an integrated approach to interconnect those constraints, functional and nonfunctional factors coming from both product design and task management processes. In the presented approach, utilizing workflow technique, the design process and task management are directly and closely interconnected at process and data level by using the shared model and the shared database. Therefore, we can easily obtain the work breakdown structure (WBS) for project management. Implemented as part of PDM (Product data management) systems, the proposed method has been tested that it can facilitate the product design. © 2008 by Springer Science+Business Media New York.
