79956139151	Elastohydrodynamic lubrication design of planetary gear transmission	Based on elastic hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) theory, an EHL model of the meshing between the sun gear and planet gear in planetary gear transmission was established. The EHL oil film thicknesses at meshing areas and those distributions for two operation cases were calculated: one case with the sun gear as the driving gear and another case with the ring gear as the driving gear. The Lubrication with second case was worse. Through the many comparing calculations the lubrication film thickness can be significantly increased by right parameter design. Reasonable raise of lubricant viscosity can get better gear lubrication. Increased gear pressure angle can greatly increase the oil film thickness. The increase of oil film thickness can improve the lubrication of gears and prevent wearing and reduce the production cost of gears, which have great practical value. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

79960873701	Elastohydrodynamic lubrication research on planetary gear transmission	Based on elastohydrodynamic Lubrication theory (EHL), the EHL oil film thicknesses and those distributions for two operation cases on meshing line were calculated: one case is the sun gear as the driving gear and another case is the ring gear as the driving gear in the Planetary Gear Transmission. From the graph, gear lubrication can be reflected by the gear mesh lubrication at the node. The worse Lubrication occurred when the planetary gears mesh with the ring gear for the sun gear as a driving gear. By comparing many calculations the lubrication oil film thickness can be significantly increased by the raise of oil viscosity and gear pressure angle. Design on lubrication of the gear to reduce friction and wear is necessary. The increase of oil film thickness can improve the lubrication of gears and prevent wearing and reduce the production cost of gears, which have great practical value. © 2011 IEEE.

84868248210	Structural design and flexibility analysis of new compliant revolute pair with macro-scale deformation	The disadvantage of current compliant pairs used in micro-displacement fields are that they produce micro-deformation rather than macro-scale deformation. In order to solve this problem, a new compliant revolute pair was proposed based on the theory of elastic deformation which can provide macro-scale deformation according to its own elastic deformation. The model of flexibility matrix was established, and rotation error was calculated with Matlab software and analyzed in Ansys. The results showed that the relative rotational stiffness error was 5.6% and relative rotation error was 3.4% according to the two methods. Finally, a test of the compliant revolute pair was carried out to justify the two above-mentioned results. It showed the flexibility analysis is reasonable.
