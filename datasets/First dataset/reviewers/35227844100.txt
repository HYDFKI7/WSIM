84927727857	Time-integrated and time-dependent angular analyses of B → J/ψKπ: A measurement of cos2β with no sign ambiguity from strong phases	We present results on B → J/ψKπ decays using e<sup>+</sup> e<sup>-</sup> annihilation data collected with the BABAR detector at the Y(4S) resonance. The detector is located at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy storage ring facility at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Using approximately 88 × 10<sup>6</sup> BB̄ pairs, we measure the decay amplitudes for the flavor eigenmodes and observe strong-phase differences indicative of final-state interactions with a significance of 7.6 standard deviations. We use the interference between the Kπ S-wave and P-wave amplitudes in the region of the K*(892) to resolve the ambiguity in the determination of these strong phases. We then perform an ambiguity-free measurement of cos2β using the angular and time-dependent asymmetry in B → J/ψK* <sup>0</sup>(K<inf>S</inf><sup>0</sup>π<sup>0</sup>) decays. With sin2β fixed at its measured value and cos2β treated as an independent parameter, we find cos2β = 2.72<inf>-0.79</inf><sup>+0.50</sup>(stat) ± 0.27(syst), determining the sign of cos2β to be positive at 86% C.L. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

27144540603	Search for b→u transitions in B-→D0K- and B-→D*0K-	We search for B-→D0K- and B-→D*0K- and charge conjugates. Here the symbol D0 indicates decay of a D0 or D̄0 into K+π-, while the symbol D*0 indicates decay of a D*0 or D̄*0 to D0π0 or D0γ. These final states can be reached through the b→c transition B-→D(*)0K- followed by the doubly Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)-suppressed D0→K+π-, or the b→u transition B-→D̄(*)0K- followed by the CKM-favored D̄0→K+π-. The interference of these two amplitudes is sensitive to the angle γ of the unitarity triangle. Our results are based on 232×106 Υ(4S)→BB̄ decays collected with the BABAR detector at SLAC. We find no significant evidence for these decays. We set a limit rB|A(B-→D̄0K-)/A(B-→D0K-)|<0.23 at 90% C.L. using the most conservative assumptions on the values of the CKM angle γ and the strong phases in the B and D decay amplitudes. In the case of the D* we set a 90% C.L. limit rB*2|A(B-→D̄*0K-)/A(B-→D*0K-) |2<(0.16)2 which is independent of assumptions on γ and strong phases. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

The inclusive branching fraction above a minimum photon energy Eγ>1.9GeV is B(b→sγ)=(3.27±0.18(stat)-0.40+0.55(syst)-0.09+0.04(theory)) ×10-4.

The photon energy spectrum is measured in the B rest frame, from which moments are derived for different values of the minimum photon energy. We present fits to the photon spectrum and moments which give the heavy-quark parameters mb and μπ2. The fitted parameters are consistent with those obtained from semileptonic B→Xc ν decays, and are useful inputs for the extraction of |Vub| from measurements of semileptonic B→Xu ν decays. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

Partial branching fraction measurements are performed in five overlapping intervals of the electron momentum; for the interval of 2.0-2.6GeV/c we obtain ΔB(B→Xueν)=(0.572±0. 041stat±0.065syst)×10-3. Combining this result with shape function parameters extracted from BABAR measurements of moments of the inclusive photon spectrum in B→Xsγ decays and moments of the hadron-mass and lepton-energy spectra in B→Xcℓν decays we determine |Vub|=(4.44±0.25exp-0.38SF+0.42±0.22theory)×10-3. Here the first error represents the combined statistical and systematic experimental uncertainties of the partial branching fraction measurement, the second error refers to the uncertainty of the determination of the shape function parameters, and the third error is due to theoretical uncertainties in the QCD calculations. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

About 20000, 33000 and 4000 fully reconstructed events, respectively, have been selected from 232fb-1 of BABAR data. The invariant mass of the hadronic final state defines the effective e+e- center-of-mass energy, so that these data can be compared with the corresponding direct e+e- measurements.

The data sample comprises 229×106Υ(4S)→BB̄ decays collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e+e- storage ring. Flavor-changing neutral current decays are highly suppressed in the standard model and their predicted properties could be significantly modified by new physics at the electroweak scale.

For two regions in + - mass, above and below mJ/ψ, we measure partial branching fractions and the forward-backward angular asymmetry of the lepton pair. In these same regions we also measure the K* longitudinal polarization in B→K* + - decays. Upper limits are obtained for the lepton-flavor-violating decays B→Keμ and B→K*eμ.

From a time-dependent maximum-likelihood fit we obtain for the parameters related to the CP violation angle 2β+γ: aDπ=-0.010±0.023±0.007, clepDπ=-0.033±0.042±0.012, aD*π=-0.040±0. 023±0.010, clepD*π=0.049±0.042±0.015,aDρ=-0. 024±0.031±0.009, clepDρ=-0.098±0.055±0.018, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. Using other measurements and theoretical assumptions, we interpret the results in terms of the angles of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa unitarity triangle and find |sin (2β+γ)|>0.64(0.40) at 68% (90%) confidence level. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646748906	Search for the charmed pentaquark candidate Θc(3100)0 in e+e- annihilations at s=10.58GeV	We search for the charmed pentaquark candidate reported by the H1 collaboration, the Θc(3100)0, in e+e- interactions at a center-of-mass (c.m.) energy of 10.58 GeV, using 124fb-1 of data recorded with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e+e- facility at SLAC. We find no evidence for such a state in the same pD*- decay mode reported by H1, and we set limits on its production cross section times branching fraction into pD*- as a function of c.m. momentum. The corresponding limit on its total rate per e+e-→qq̄ event, times branching fraction, is about 3 orders of magnitude lower than rates measured for the charmed Λc and Σc baryons in such events. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The data were taken with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II B Factory operating on and near the Υ(4S) resonance. We find B(D+→π+π0)=(1.25±0.10±0. 09±0.04)×10-3 and B(D+→K+π0)=(2.52±0.47±0. 25±0.08)×10-4, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic and the last error is due to the uncertainties in the absolute branching fraction scale for D+ mesons.

33746608115	Study of the decay B̄0→D*+ωπ-	We report on a study of the decay B̄0→D*+ωπ- with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II B-factory at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Based on a sample of 232×106 BB̄ decays, we measure the branching fraction B(B̄0→D*+ωπ-)=(2.88±0. 21(stat.)±0.31(syst.))×10-3. We study the invariant mass spectrum of the ωπ- system in this decay. This spectrum is in good agreement with expectations based on factorization and the measured spectrum in τ-→ωπ-ντ. We also measure the polarization of the D*+ as a function of the ωπ- mass. In the mass region 1.1 to 1.9 GeV we measure the fraction of longitudinal polarization of the D*+ to be ΓL/Γ=0.654±0.042(stat.)±0.016(syst.).

33748686362	Measurement of the spin of the Ω-hyperon	A measurement of the spin of the Ω- hyperon produced through the exclusive process Ξc0→Ω-K+ is presented using a total integrated luminosity of 116fb-1 recorded with the BABAR detector at the e+e- asymmetric-energy B factory at SLAC. Under the assumption that the Ξc0 has spin 1/2, the angular distribution of the Λ from Ω-→ΛK- decay is inconsistent with all half-integer Ω- spin values other than 3/2. Lower statistics data for the process Ωc0→Ω-π+ from a 230fb-1 sample are also found to be consistent with Ω- spin 3/2. If the Ξc0 spin were 3/2, an Ω- spin of 5/2 could not be excluded. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33746862903	Dalitz plot analysis of the decay B±→K±K±K	We analyze the three-body charmless decay B±→K±K± K using a sample of 226.0±2.5 million BB̄ pairs collected by the BABAR detector. We measure the total branching fraction and CP asymmetry to be B=(35.2±0.9±1.6)×10-6 and ACP=(-1.7±2.6±1.5)%. We fit the Dalitz plot distribution using an isobar model and measure the magnitudes and phases of the decay coefficients. We find no evidence of CP violation for the individual components of the isobar model. The decay dynamics is dominated by the K+K- S-wave, for which we perform a partial-wave analysis in the region m(K+K-)<2GeV/c2. Significant production of the f0(980) resonance, and of a spin zero state near 1.55GeV/c2 are required in the isobar model description of the data. The partial-wave analysis supports this observation. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Our central value for the branching fraction, assuming the true Dalitz distribution is uniform and excluding the resonance, is B(B0→KS0KS0KL0)=(2.4-2.5+2.7±0.6) ×10-6 where the errors are statistical and systematic, respectively. We set a single-sided Bayesian upper limit of B(B0→KS0KS0KL0)<7.4×10- 6 at 90% confidence level using a uniform prior probability for physical values.

We include the effects of final-state radiation from the daughter mesons for the first time, and quote branching fractions for the inclusive processes B0→h+h′-nγ, where h and h′ are pions or kaons. The maximum value of the sum of the energies of the n undetected photons, Eγmax, is mode-dependent. Using a data sample of approximately 227×106 Υ(4S)→BB̄ decays collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+e- collider at SLAC, we measure: B(B0→π+π-nγ;Eγmax =150MeV)=(5.1±0.4±0.2) ×10-6, B(B0→K+π-nγ;Eγmax =105MeV)=(18.1±0. 6±0.6)×10-6, B(B0→K+K-nγ;Eγmax =59MeV)<0.5×10-6(90%confidence level), where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. Theoretical calculations can be used to extrapolate from the above measurements the nonradiative branching fractions, B0.

33846441670	Inclusive Λc+ production in e+e- annihilations at s=10.54GeV and in Υ(4S) decays	We present measurements of the total production rates and momentum distributions of the charmed baryon Λc+ in e+e-→hadrons at a center-of-mass energy of 10.54 GeV and in Υ(4S) decays. In hadronic events at 10.54 GeV, charmed hadrons are almost exclusively leading particles in e+e-→cc̄ events, allowing direct studies of c-quark fragmentation. We measure a momentum distribution for Λc+ baryons that differs significantly from those measured previously for charmed mesons. Comparing with a number of models, we find none that can describe the distribution completely. We measure an average scaled momentum of xp=0.574±0.009 and a total rate of NΛcqq̄=0.057±0.002(exp.)±0.015(BF)Λc+ per hadronic event, where the experimental error is much smaller than that due to the branching fraction into the reconstructed decay mode, pK-π+. In Υ(4S) decays we measure a total rate of NΛcΥ=0.091±0. 006(exp.)±0.024(BF) per Υ(4S) decay, and find a much softer momentum distribution than expected from B decays into a Λc+ plus an antinucleon and one to three pions. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

33846786557	Branching fraction measurement of B̄0→D(*)+π- and B-→D(*)0π- and isospin analysis of B̄→D(*)π decays	Using 65×106 Υ(4S)→BB̄ events collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e+e- storage ring at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, we measure the color-favored branching fractions B(B̄0→D+π- )=(2.55±0.05±0.16)×10-3, B(B̄0→D*+π-)=(2. 79±0.08±0.17)×10-3, B(B-→D0π-)=(4.90±0. 07±0.22)×10-3 and B(B-→D*0π-)=(5.52±0. 17±0.42)×10-3, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. With these results and the current world average for the branching fraction for the color-suppressed decay B̄0→D(*) 0π0, the cosines of the strong phase difference δ between the I=1/2 and I=3/2 isospin amplitudes are determined to be cos δ=0.872-0.007-0.029+0. 008+0.031 for the B̄→Dπ process and cos δ=0.924-0.017-0. 054+0.019+0.063 for the B̄→D*π process. Under the isospin symmetry, the results for cos δ suggest the presence of final-state interactions in the Dπ system. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

33846849565	Observation of B→η′K* and evidence for B+→η′ρ+	We present an observation of B→η′K*. The data sample corresponds to 232×106 BB̄ pairs collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy B factory at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. We measure the branching fractions (in units of 10-6) B(B0→η′K*0)=3.8±1.1±0.5 and B(B+→η′K*+)=4.9-1.7+1.9±0.8, where the first error is statistical and the second systematic.

33947264659	Measurements of Λc+ branching fractions of Cabibbo-suppressed decay modes involving Λ and Σ0	We measure the branching ratios of the Cabibbo-suppressed decays Λc+→ΛK+ and Λc+→Σ0K+ relative to the Cabibbo-favored decay modes Λc+→Λπ+ and Λc+→Σ0π+ to be 0.044±0.004(stat.)±0.003(syst. ) and 0.038±0.005(stat.)±0.003(syst.), respectively.

33847679325	Measurement of the B0→π-l+ν form-factor shape and branching fraction, and determination of |Vub| with a loose neutrino reconstruction technique	We report the results of a study of the exclusive charmless semileptonic decay, B0→π-ℓ+ν, undertaken with approximately 227×106 BB̄ pairs collected at the Υ(4S) resonance with the BABAR detector. The analysis uses events in which the signal B decays are reconstructed with an innovative loose neutrino reconstruction technique. We obtain partial branching fractions in 12 bins of q2, the momentum transfer squared, from which we extract the f+(q2) form-factor shape and the total branching fraction B(B0→π-ℓ+ν)=(1.46±0.07stat±0.08syst)×10-4. Based on a recent unquenched lattice QCD calculation of the form factor in the range q2>16GeV2, we find the magnitude of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element |Vub| to be (4.1±0.2stat±0.2syst+0.6-0.4FF) ×10-3, where the last uncertainty is due to the normalization of the form factor. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34247246713	Study of inclusive B- and B̄0 decays to flavor-tagged D, Ds, and Λc+	We report on a study of inclusive B- and B̄0 meson decays to D0X, D̄0X, D+X, D-X, Ds+X, Ds-X, Λc+X, Λ̄c-X, based on a sample of 231×106 BB̄ events recorded with the BABAR detector at the Υ(4S) resonance. Events are selected by completely reconstructing one B and searching for a reconstructed charm particle in the rest of the event. From the measured branching fractions of these decays, we infer the number of charm and anticharm particles per B̄ decay, separately for charged and neutral parents. We derive the total charm yield per B- decay, nc-=1.208±0. 023±0.040-0.029+0.035, and per B̄0 decay, nc0=1.203±0. 030±0.034-0.035+0.044 where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third reflects the charm branching-fraction uncertainties. We also present the charm momentum distributions measured in the B̄ rest frame. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34547242429	Evidence of a broad structure at an invariant mass of 4.32GeV/c2 in the reaction e+e-→π+π-ψ(2S) measured at BABAR	We present a measurement of the cross section of the process e+e-→π+π-ψ(2S) from threshold up to 8 GeV center-of-mass energy using events containing initial-state radiation, produced at the SLAC PEP-II e+e- storage rings. The study is based on 298fb-1 of data recorded with the BABAR detector. A structure is observed in the cross section not far above threshold, near 4.32 GeV. We also investigate the compatibility of this structure with the Y(4260) previously reported by this experiment. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

37249058501	Measurement of CP violation parameters with a dalitz plot analysis of B±→Dπ+π-π0K±	We report the results of a CP violation analysis of the decay B±→Dπ+π-π0K±, where Dπ+π-π0 indicates a neutral D meson detected in the final state π+π-π0, excluding KS0π0. The analysis makes use of 324×106 e+e-→BB̄ events recorded by the BABAR experiment at the PEP-II e+e- storage ring. Analyzing the π+π-π0 Dalitz plot distribution and the B±→Dπ+π- π0K± branching fraction and decay rate asymmetry, we find the following one-standard-deviation constraints on the amplitude ratio and on the weak and strong phases: 0.06<rB<0.78, -30°<γ<76°, -27°<δ<78°. We also measure the magnitudes and phases of the components of the D0→π+π-π0 decay amplitude. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

33644852108	Search for the decay B+→τ+ντ	We search for the rare leptonic decay B+→τ+ντ in a sample of 232×106 BB̄ pairs collected with the BABAR detector at the SLAC PEP-II B-Factory. Signal events are selected by examining the properties of the B meson recoiling against the semileptonic decay B-→D*0-ν̄. We find no evidence for a signal and set an upper limit on the branching fraction of B(B+→τ+ντ)<2.8×10-4 at the 90% confidence level. We combine this result with a previous, statistically independent BABAR search for B+→τ+ντ to give an upper limit of B(B+→τ+ντ)<2.6×10-4 at the 90% confidence level. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

A maximum likelihood fit finds the following branching fractions: B(B0→K0π+π-)=(43.0±2.3±2.3) ×10-6,B(B0→f0(→π+π-)K0)=(5.5±0.7±0. 5±0.3)×10-6 and B(B0→K*+π-)=(11.0±1. 5±0.5±0.5)×10-6. For these results, the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third (if present) is due to the effect of interference from other resonances. We also measure the CP-violating charge asymmetry in the decay B0→K*+π-, AK*π=-0. 11±0.14±0.05. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

These include significant improvements over previous measurements and a first measurement of B(τ-→K-K-K+ντ) in which no resonance structure is assumed. We also report a first measurement of B(τ-→ π-ντ)=(3. 42±0.55±0.25)×10-5, a new measurement of B(τ-→ K-ντ)=(3.39±0.20±0.28)×10-5 and a first upper limit on B(τ-→K-K-K+ντ(ex.)). © 2008 The American Physical Society.

The decays were collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric B factory at SLAC. The fitted asymmetries for the small observed differences in the tracking efficiency were corrected between positively and negatively charged track. It was found that the uncertainty in the fixed parameters of the PDFs, determined by fits to stimulated or nonsignal data sets, contributed 0.001 to the systematic errors.
