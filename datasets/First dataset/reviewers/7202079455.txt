15944414771	Experimental observations of nonlinear effects of Lamb waves	The experimental observations of nonlinear effects of Lamb waves have been reported. Firstly, the brief descriptions have been made for the nonlinear acoustic measurement system developed by Ritec. The detailed considerations of acoustic experiment system established for observing nonlinear effects of Lamb waves have been carried out. Especially, the analysis focuses on the time-domain responses of second harmonics of Lame waves by employing a straightforward model. Based on the existence condition of strong nonlinearities of Lamb waves, the wedge transducers are designed to generate and detect Lamb waves in aluminum plate. For the different space distance between the transmitting and receiving wedge transducers, the amplitudes of the fundamental and second-harmonic Lamb waves on the plate surfaces have been measured within a given frequency range. In the near range of a frequency where the fundamental and the double frequency Lamb waves have the same phase velocities, the quantitative relations of second-harmonic amplitudes on propagation distance have been analyzed.

16244421390	Modal expansion analyses of second-harmonic generation of the Lamb waves in layered structures	Through second-order perturbation approximation and modal expansion approach, the second-harmonic generation of a primary Lamb wave propagating in layered structures has been analyzed, and the general solution to second-harmonic displacement fields has been obtained. Because of the bulk elastic nonlinearities of solids, there are double frequency bulk driving forces in the interior of each layer and double frequency traction stress tensors at the two surfaces of each layer when a primary Lamb wave travels along layered structures. These driving forces and traction stress tensors of double the primary frequency generate a series of double frequency Lamb wave normal modes (abbr. DFLMs), and the summation of a series of DFLMs constitutes the second-harmonic fields of a primary Lamb wave. It is found that the DFLM component of a primary Lamb wave can grow with propagation distance down layered structures when its phase velocity equals that of a primary Lamb wave. Numerical simulations of second-harmonic displacement fields of a primary Lamb wave have been carried out for a layered structure consisting of aluminum-epoxy-aluminum. The results show that the properties of soft adhesive joint play a dominant role in generation of the second harmonics.

0000142981	Cumulative second-harmonic generation of Lamb-mode propagation in a solid plate	This article describes the physical process of cumulative second-harmonic generation of Lamb-mode propagation in a solid plate. In general, cumulative second-harmonic generation of a dispersive guided wave propagation does not occur. However, the present results show that the second harmonic of Lamb-mode propagation arising from the nonlinear interaction of partial bulk waves and the restriction of the two boundaries of the solid plate does have a cumulative effect once some conditions are satisfied. Through boundary and initial conditions of excitation, the analytical expression of the cumulative second harmonic of Lamb-mode propagation has been determined. Numerical results reveal that the cumulative second-harmonic fields are symmetrical regardless of whether Lamb-mode propagation is symmetrical or antisymmetrical, and that the cumulative second-harmonic field patterns of Lamb-mode propagation are associated with the position of excitation source. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.

2442546750	Second-harmonic generation of Lamb modes in a solid layer supported by a semi-infinite substrate	Using a second-order perturbation approximation and a modal expansion analysis approach, this study develops an effective technique for studying the generation of second harmonics of Lamb modes propagating in the composite structure consisting of a solid layer supported by a semi-infinite substrate. The nonlinearity in the elastic wave motion process can result in the generation of second harmonics of primary Lamb mode propagation in the composite structure, and this nonlinearity may be treated as a second-order perturbation of the elastic response of the primary waves. There are second-order bulk and surface/interface driving sources in the composite structure wherever the primary Lamb modes propagate. These driving sources can be thought of as the forcing functions of a finite series of double-frequency Lamb modes (DFLMs) in terms of the approach of modal expansion analysis for waveguide excitation. The fields of the second harmonics of the primary Lamb modes can be regarded as superpositions of the fields of a finite series of DFLMs. Although Lamb modes are dispersive, the field of one DFLM component can have a cumulative growth effect when its phase velocity exactly or approximately equals that of a primary Lamb mode. The formal solutions for the second harmonics of Lamb modes have been obtained. The numerical simulations clearly show the physical process of the generation of second harmonics of Lamb modes in the composite structure. The complicated problems of second-harmonic generation of Lamb modes have been exactly determined within the second-order perturbation approximation.

The two interdigital transducers (IDTs) are deposited at an interface of the structure respectively. The two piezoelectric substrates are parallel to each other and the two IDTs are positioned face to face. Under given conditions, the first IDT deposited at one interface and driven by a tone burst can generate a high frequency Acoustic Bulk Wave (BAW) pulse only into the liquid layer. The BAW pulse generated with the first IDT can reflect back and forth in the liquid layer between the two interfaces of the structure. There is an output of electrical pulse in the second IDT located on the other interface of the structure when the BAW pulse generated with the first IDT impinges on the location of the second IDT each time. The density of the liquid layer between the two piezoelectric substrates can be characterized by the change of transient time of a round trip of the BAW pulse. The density of the liquid layer can be obtained by measuring the change of the interval between the first two electrical pulses from the second IDT.

33745685400	Influences of interfacial properties on second-harmonic generation of Lamb waves propagating in layered planar structures	This paper describes influences of interfacial properties on second-harmonic generation of Lamb waves propagating in layered planar structures. The nonlinearity in the elastic wave propagation is treated as a second-order perturbation of the linear elastic response. Due to the kinematic nonlinearity and the elastic nonlinearity of materials, there are second-order bulk and surface/interface driving sources in layered planar structures through which Lamb waves propagate. These driving sources can be thought of as forcing functions of a series of double frequency lamb waves (DFLWs) in terms of the approach of modal expansion analysis for waveguide excitation. The total second-harmonic fields consist of a summation of DFLWs in the corresponding stress-free layered planar structures. The interfacial properties of layered planar structures can be described by the well-known finite interfacial stiffness technique. The normal and tangential interfacial stiffness constants can be coupled with the equation governing the expansion coefficient of each DFLW component. On the other hand, the normal and tangential interfacial stiffness constants are associated with the degree of dispersion between Lamb waves and DFLWs. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations indicate that the efficiency of second-harmonic generation by Lamb wave propagation is closely dependent on the interfacial properties of layered structures. The potential of using the effect of second-harmonic generation by Lamb wave propagation to characterize the interfacial properties of layered structures are considered.

This characterization approach is useful for some practical situations where ultrasonic transducers cannot touch the surfaces to be inspected, e.g. the inside surfaces of sealed vessels. In this paper, the influences of changes in the surface properties of a solid plate on the effect of second-harmonic generation by Lamb wave propagation were analyzed. A surface coating with the different properties was used to simulate changes in the surface properties of a solid plate. When the areas and thicknesses of coatings on the surface of a given solid plate changed, the amplitude-frequency curves both of the fundamental waves and the second harmonics by Lamb wave propagation were measured under the condition that Lamb waves had a strong nonlinearity. It was found that changes in the surface properties might clearly affect the efficiency of second-harmonic generation by Lamb wave propagation.

The effect of second-harmonic generation in an anisotropic solid plate exists and through this the Lamb waves propagate. When the direction of the Lamb wave propagation in an anisotropic plate changes, the influences of the elastic anisotropy of the plate material on the second-harmonic generation of the Lamb wave propagation have been analyzed. Theoretical analyses show that the effect of second-harmonic generation of the Lamb wave propagation is closely associated with the elastic anisotropy of the solid plate. Based on the theoretical analyses, characterization of the in-plane elastic anisotropy of a given rolled aluminum sheet is experimentally studied. For the different directions of the Lamb wave propagation relative to the rolling direction of the aluminum sheet, the amplitude-frequency curves both of the fundamental waves and the second harmonics of Lamb wave propagation are measured under the condition that the Lamb waves have a strong nonlinearity. It is found that the in-plane elastic anisotropy of the rolled aluminum sheet can clearly affect the efficiency of second-harmonic generation by the Lamb wave propagation. The stress wave factors (SWFs) in acousto-ultrasonic technique are used for reference. Based on the data measured, the normalized SWF curves of the Lamb wave propagation versus the orientation angles relative to the rolling direction of the aluminum sheet are obtained. The results show that the second-harmonic SWF of the Lamb wave propagation varies more sensitively with the orientation angles than does the SWF of the fundamental Lamb wave propagation. It is found that the effect of second-harmonic generation of the Lamb wave propagation can be used to accurately characterize the in-plane elastic anisotropy for the given solid plate. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

There are two or more sets of fundamental modes with different frequencies, in the waveguide, if an excitation source is of multi-frequency. The cross-interaction between two partial waves of the fundamental modes with different frequencies causes the generation of the driven SF and DF waves. The driven SF and DF waves may have the cumulative growth effect once the two fundamental modes with different frequencies have the same phase velocities. With appropriate boundary and initial conditions of excitation, the physical process of generation of the cumulative SF and DF waves has been clearly shown, and the analytical solution of the cumulative SF and DF waves has also been determined. The solution shows that the cumulative SF and DF acoustic fields may be symmetrical or antisymmetrical.

Considering the measurement function of the Ritec-SNAP system, the physical meaning of integral of the envelope of second-harmonic time-domain pulse has been analyzed in detail. This integral can describe the efficiency of second-harmonic generation accompanying the primary Lamb wave time-domain pulse, as well as the dispersion degree between the primary and the double frequency Lamb waves. Within the specific frequency range where the phase velocities of the primary Lamb waves exactly or approximately equal that of the double frequency Lamb waves, the second-harmonic signals without overlapping of multi-modes of the double frequency Lamb waves have been clearly observed. This phenomenon shows that the strong nonlinearity does occur in the primary Lamb wave propagation process. For the three different adhesive joints, the experiment results show that both the stress wave factors of the nonlinear Lamb waves firstly introduced in the present paper, and the frequency values corresponding to the peaks of the amplitude-frequency curves of the second-harmonic signals can effectively characterize the properties of the adhesive joints.

Under second-order perturbation approximation, the nonlinear effect of Lamb wave propagation may be treated as a second-order perturbation of linear response of Lamb wave propagation. The weak interfaces can be described by the interfacial spring model. According to the modal expansion approach for waveguide excitation, the second-harmonic fields of a fundamental Lamb wave propagation can be decomposed into a series of double frequency Lamb waves. It is found that changes in the properties of the weak interfaces will influence the expansion coefficients of double frequency Lamb waves in several aspects. Especially, changes in the phase velocities of Lamb waves caused by changes in the properties of the weak interfaces will remarkably affect the degree of cumulative growth effect of double frequency Lamb waves.

As in the case of second-harmonic generation of Lamb-wave propagation in a solid plate, in general, cumulative second-harmonic generation of GLW propagation does not occur. However, the present paper shows that, under certain conditions, the GLW second harmonic arising from the nonlinear interaction of the partial bulk acoustic waves and the restriction of the two boundaries of the solid waveguide does retain a cumulative growth effect. Through a second-order boundary condition, the existence condition of second-harmonic generation of GLW propagation has been determined, and through the initial condition of excitation the analytical solution of the cumulative second harmonic of GLW propagation formally obtained. Numerical results show the cumulative effect of GLW second-harmonic field patterns.

With the established experimental system for ultrasonic Lamb waves, the fundamental- and second-harmonic amplitude-frequency curves of Lamb waves, propagating in an aeronautic aluminum sheet without being subjected to any cyclic loading, were measured. Reasonable physical explanations were given for the data measured. The tension-tension fatigue loading was respectively applied to the two given aeronautic aluminum sheets. The fundamental- and second-harmonic amplitude-frequency curves of ultrasonic Lamb waves, propagating in the two specimens subjected to tension-tension fatigue loading for different numbers of loading cycles, were measured under the condition that ultrasonic Lamb waves had a strong nonlinearity. It was found, in the early stages of fatigue damage in the specimens, that the change in the Stress Wave Factor (SWF) of the fundamental waves of ultrasonic Lamb waves with the number of loading cycles (N) was not obvious, and that there was not a clear monotonic relationship between the SWF of the fundamental Lamb waves and N. In the initial stage of cyclic loading, however, the change in the second-harmonic SWF of ultrasonic Lamb waves was very sensitive to N, and there was a clear monotonic relationship between second-harmonic SWF of ultrasonic Lamb waves and N. It could be concluded that the nonlinear effects of ultrasonic Lamb waves and the corresponding second-harmonic SWF might offer a potential for accurately evaluating the early stages of fatigue damage in solid plates.

Due to the kinematic nonlinearity and the elastic nonlinearity of materials, there is second-harmonic generation accompanying the primary Lamb wave propagation. The well-known finite interfacial stiffness technique is used to describe the properties of weak interfaces of layered planar structures. It is found that the finite normal and tangential interfacial stiffnesses will effectively influence the effect of second-harmonic generation by Lamb wave propagation at the modal expansion coefficients of the Double Frequency Lamb Waves (abbr. DFLWs, constituting the second-harmonic fields) and at the dispersion relations of Lamb waves (determining the degree of cumulative growth of a DFLW component). Relative to the case where the interface of a layered planar structure is perfect and the phase velocity of the DFLW component is equal to that of the primary Lamb wave propagation at a given frequency where the DFLW component grows with propagation distance, the efficiency of second-harmonic generation of the primary Lamb wave propagation will decrease greatly when the normal and tangential interfacial stiffnesses decrease. The effect of second-harmonic generation by the primary Lamb wave propagation may provide a potential for accurately characterizing the properties of weak interfaces of layered planar structures. © 2006 IEEE.

59949097512	Experimental observations of nonlinear effects of SH plate wave propagation in a solid plate	The effect of second-harmonic generation of SH plate wave propagation in a solid plate was briefly analyzed theoretically using perturbation approximation and modal expansion approach for waveguide excitation. Although the effect of second-harmonic generation of a single shear wave in an infinite solid is weak, a SH plate wave consisting of two shear waves in a solid plate may have a strong nonlinear effect under certain conditions. This paper focused on the experimental verification of the said theoretical prediction. Both the shear-wave wedge transducer for excitation of SH plate waves and the liquid wedge transducer for receiving the signals of second harmonics were manufactured, and the experimental system for studying the nonlinear effects of SH plate wave propagation was established. Through the theoretical analyses in detail and the comparative experimental investigations, it was clarified that the clear second-harmonic signal observed under certain conditions was due to the strong nonlinear effect of SH plate wave propagation. Moreover, the amplitude-frequency curves of second harmonics, with respect to the different distances of SH plate wave propagation, were measured in the far-field regions. The relationship between the second-harmonic signals of the SH plate wave and the propagation distance was analyzed near the specific frequency at which the phase velocity of a SH plate wave was equal to that of a double frequency symmetric Lamb wave. It was experimentally verified that, under certain conditions, the second-harmonic amplitude of SH plate wave propagation could grow with propagation distance, namely, SH plate wave propagation could have a strong nonlinearity.

62649088457	Cumulative second-harmonic generation of Lamb waves propagating in a two-layered solid plate	The physical process of cumulative second-harmonic generation of Lamb waves propagating in a two-layered solid plate is presented by using the second-order perturbation and the technique of nonlinear reflection of acoustic waves at an interface. In general, the cumulative second-harmonic generation of a dispersive guided wave propagation does not occur. However, the present paper shows that the second-harmonic of Lamb wave propagation arising from the nonlinear interaction of the partial bulk acoustic waves and the restriction of the three boundaries of the solid plates does have a cumulative growth effect if some conditions are satisfied. Through boundary condition and initial condition of excitation, the analytical expression of cumulative second-harmonic of Lamb waves propagation is determined. Numerical results show the cumulative effect of Lamb waves on second-harmonic field patterns. © 2008 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.

68249138444	Analysis of second-harmonic generation of Lamb waves using a combined method in a two-layered solid waveguide	Within the second-order perturbation treatment, the present work analyzed the complex second-harmonic generation of Lamb waves in a two-layered solid waveguide by combining the modal analysis method and the nonlinear reflection of acoustic waves at interfaces. The formal solution of the second-harmonic field is obtained on the basis of the modal analysis approach, from which a phase matching modification factor can be determined. The solution of the cumulative second-harmonic displacement field derived from the nonlinear reflection of acoustic waves at interfaces can be modified by multiplying the phase matching modification factor, and then be more general and applicable for the total second-harmonic field of Lamb wave propagation. Numerical computation results show that amplitude of the second-harmonic displacement increases clearly with propagation distance when the phase velocity of a double frequency Lamb wave (DFLW) component is exactly or approximately equivalent to that of the primary Lamb wave propagation, and reveal that the amplitudes of the second harmonics exhibit a decreasing tendency when the relative deviation of phase velocity between the primary Lamb wave and the DFLW component increases. Primary experimental measurements have been performed to verify the results of the numerical simulations in a FeCrNi alloy steel specimen.

The gray images of ultrasonic guided wave amplitude spectra that can straightforwardly characterize the degree of fatigue in composite sheets are obtained. The numerical results show that, with the tension-tension or bending fatigue loading, there is a monotonic relationship between the average gray value of gray images of ultrasonic guided wave amplitude spectra and the change rate of equivalent Young's modulus or equivalent shear modulus. It is concluded that the ultrasonic guided wave amplitude spectra may be used to effectively characterize the early stages of fatigue damage in composite sheets.

Two interdigital transducers (IDTs) are deposited, respectively, at the two parallel interfaces of the layered structure. Under given conditions, the first IDT deposited at one interface and driven by a tone burst can generate a high frequency bulk acoustic wave (BAW) pulse into the solution layer only. This BAW pulse propagates through the solution layer and impinges on the second IDT deposited at the other interface. The second IDT then produces an electrical pulse output, containing information of the solution concentration of the liquid layer via the carrier phase delay of the BAW pulse propagation. Based on the theoretical consideration, a high sensitivity solution-concentration sensor using BAW generation and detection with the IDTs is designed and fabricated. Its feasibility and performance are also experimentally examined. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77955506281	Assessment of fatigue damage in solid plates through the ultrasonic Lamb wave approach	Changes (degradations) in the mechanical properties of solid plates induced by cyclic fatigue loading will influence the features of ultrasonic Lamb wave propagation, such as dispersion and attenuation. This paper has qualitatively analyzed the feasibility of using the amplitude-frequency characteristics and the stress wave factors (SWFs) of ultrasonic Lamb wave propagation to assess fatigue damage in solid plates. Liquid wedge transducers located on the surface of solid plates tested are used to generate and detect the Lamb wave signals. Based on the Ritec-SNAP ultrasonic measurement system, the experimental setup for assessing the degree of fatigue damage in solid plates using ultrasonic Lamb wave approach has been established. For several rolled aluminum sheets subjected to tension-tension cyclic loading, the experimental examinations have been performed for the relationships between the amplitude-frequency characteristics of ultrasonic Lamb wave propagation and the numbers of loading cycles (denoted by N), as well as the correlations between the Lamb wave SWFs and N. The experimental results show that the Lamb wave SWFs decrease monotonously and sensitively with the increment of cycles of fatigue loading. Based on the correlations between the Lamb wave SWFs and N, it is further verified that ultrasonic Lamb wave propagation combined with the Lamb wave SWFs can be used to effectively assess early fatigue damage in solid plates. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

By applying the second-order perturbation method, the nonlinear spring models are rigorously developed in the limit of small thickness to wavelength ratio. Numerical results agree well with the exact solutions obtained by continuous boundary conditions.

Experimental results reveal that the above model is rather accurate and as the impedance ratio of adherend to adherend increases, the model becomes more accurate.

78649989167	Time-domain analysis of second-harmonic generation of primary Lamb wave propagation in an elastic plate	Within the second-order perturbation approximation, this paper investigates the physical process of generation of the time-domain second harmonic by a primary Lamb wave waveform in an elastic plate. The present work is performed based on the preconditions that the phase velocity matching is satisfied and that the transfer of energy from the primary Lamb wave to the double frequency Lamb wave is not zero. It investigates the influences of the difference between the group velocities of the primary Lamb wave and the double frequency Lamb wave, the propagation distance and the duration of the primary Lamb wave waveform on the envelope shape of the time-domain second harmonic. It finds that the maximum magnitude of the envelope of the second-harmonic waveform can grow within some propagation distance even if the condition of group velocity matching is not satisfied. Our analyses also indicate that the maximum magnitude of the envelope of the second-harmonic waveform is kept constant beyond a specific propagation distance. Furthermore, it concludes that the integration amplitude of the time-domain second-harmonic waveform always grows with propagation distance within the second-order perturbation. The present research yields new physical insight not previously available into the effect of generation of the time-domain second harmonic by propagation of a primary Lamb wave waveform. © 2010 Chinese Physics Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

The focus here is on weakly nonlinear wave motion, for which the successive approximation can be adopted. The analysis is based on the assumptions that the material of each layer is isotropic and homogeneous with no attenuation and no dispersion, and that the higher harmonic energy is much less than that of the fundamental. On the basis of these assumptions and partial plane wave approach, a theoretical model for nonlinear generation of finite-amplitude Lamb modes in a layered planar structure has been established.

Based on the preconditions that the transfer of energy from the primary Lamb wave to the double frequency Lamb wave is not zero and that the phase velocity matching condition is satisfied, we focus on analyzing the influence of mismatching of the group velocities on the generation of the second harmonic by propagation of a primary Lamb wave tone burst with a finite duration. Our analysis indicates that the time-domain envelope of the second harmonic generated is dependent on the propagation distance when both the duration of the primary Lamb wave tone burst and the group velocity mismatch are given. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the integrated amplitude of the time-domain second harmonic, which quantifies the efficiency of the second-harmonic generation, grows with the propagation distance even when the group velocity matching condition is not satisfied.

Ageing of ferritic Cr-Ni alloy materials have been done at 1223 K and 1173 K for different degradation time intervals and air cooled. The results show that the normalized acoustic nonlinearity of Lamb wave increases with the formation of fine precipitates at the early stage of ageing till about 1000 h and keeps as a plateau with the precipitates dynamic balance for a long-term ageing, and then decreases gradually at the final holding time with the coarsening of precipitates and initiation of microvoids. The results also show that the variation of nonlinear Lamb wave follows the same trend as that of hardness in materials. Therefore, the cumulative second-harmonic of ultrasonic Lamb waves has been found to be strongly sensitive to the precipitates behavior and microstructure evolution during the thermal ageing of ferritic Cr-Ni alloy steel. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Experiments were carried out to introduce controlled levels of thermal damage to determine the nonlinear response of Lamb waves. A mountain-shape change in the normalized acoustic nonlinearity of Lamb wave versus the level of thermal degradation in the specimens has been observed. The variation in the measured acoustic nonlinearity reveals, based on metallographic studies, that the normalized acoustic nonlinearity increases due to the second phase precipitates in the early stage and it decreases as a combined result of dislocation change and micro-void initiation in the material.

The cumulative second-harmonic of Lamb wave propagation is shown to depend dominantly on the dislocation density, pinning dislocation length, internal stress due to the coherency strain, volume fraction of the precipitates, and the phase matching degree between the primary Lamb wave and the double frequency Lamb wave (DFLW). Experiments were carried out to introduce controlled levels of creep-induced damage to determine the nonlinear response of Lamb waves in titanium alloy Ti60 plates. A like mountain-shape change in the normalized acoustic nonlinearity of Lamb wave versus the creep loading time has been observed. Microscopic image analyses were performed to interpret the variation of the measured acoustic nonlinearity and to obtain the microstructure parameters of the Ti60 specimens with different creep damages. The analytical model was applied to these creep damaged Ti60 specimens, which revealed a good accordance with the measured results of the nonlinear Lamb waves. These results indicate that the acoustic nonlinearity of Lamb wave increases due to the rising of the precipitation volume fraction and the dislocation density in the early stage, and it decreases as a combined result of the reduction of the precipitation volume fraction and the dislocation density and the increasing mismatch of the phase velocity between the primary Lamb wave and the DFLW after a further creep loading. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

0037303323	Generation of cumulative sum frequency acoustic waves of shear horizontal modes in a solid plate	The physical process of generation of the cumulative sum frequency acoustic waves (SFAWs) of shear horizontal (SH) modes propagating in a solid plate is described in this paper. Due to the bulk elastic nonlinearity of material of the solid plate, there will be the SFAWs and difference frequency acoustic waves (DFAWs) once an excitation source of SH modes include two or more frequencies. A technique based on second-order perturbation is given for analyzing generation of the SFAWs and DFAWs, which arise from the nonlinear cross interaction of the partial shearwaves of SHmodes with the different frequencies. The following conclusions have been acquired in this paper. The DFAWsmust not have a cumulative growth effect, the SFAWs may have a cumulative growth effect once some conditions are satisfied, and the SFAW fields with cumulative growth effect may be symmetrical or antisymmetrical. This paper also derives the analytical solution of the cumulative SFAWs, which satisfies the boundary and initial conditions of excitation. Numerical results clearly reveal the distortion and growth effects of the cumulative SFAWfield patterns along the propagation direction, as well as the dependence of the cumulative SFAWfield patterns on the position of the excitation source. The process of analysis shown in this paper yields clear physical insight into the cumulative SFAW generation of SH modes with different frequencies not previously available. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

84870601568	Time-domain measurement technique of second harmonic of ultrasonic Lamb waves using mismatch of group velocities	Taking into account the fact that there is an inevitable influence of the transmitting and receiving transducers on the time-domain second-harmonic signal of the ultrasonic Lamb waves, a time-domain measurement technique of second harmonic has been proposed using mismatch of group velocities between the fundamental and double frequency Lamb waves. When there is a phase velocity matching but group velocity mismatching between the fundamental and double frequency Lamb waves, the second-harmonic signal of the ultrasonic Lamb wave propagation can be separated in the time domain from that generated by the wedge transducers used for generating and receiving the ultrasonic Lamb waves. The present technique uses the integrated amplitude of the time-domain second-harmonic signal that is only produced by the fundamental Lamb wave propagation to quantify the efficiency of the second-harmonic generation. The measurement procedure of the time-domain second harmonic has been demonstrated by an experiment where a fundamental Lamb wave propagates in an aluminum sheet. It is known that, through the measurement technique proposed in this paper, the condition for measurements of the second harmonic of the ultrasonic Lamb waves can be relaxed, and the influences of the wedge transducers on the second harmonic can be deducted completely. The second- harmonic signal measured by the present technique is completely due to the effect of second-harmonic generation of the time-domain signal of the fundamental Lamb waves.

84873677825	Analysis of second-harmonic generation by primary horizontal shear modes in layered planar structures with imperfect interfaces	This paper describes modeling of second-harmonic generation by the primary horizontal shear (SH) mode propagation in layered planar structures with imperfect interfaces. Due to the elastic nonlinearity of the solid, there are second-order bulk driving forces in each solid layer and a second-order stress tensor at each surface/interface, accompanying the primary SH mode propagation. Within second-order perturbation, these bulk driving forces and stress tensors can be thought of as the excitation source of a series of double frequency Lamb modes (DFLMs) in terms of the approach of modal expansion analysis for waveguide excitation. The equation governing the expansion coefficient of each DFLM is developed. It is found that the expansion coefficient of each DFLM is directly coupled with the interfacial properties, characterized by the finite normal and tangential interfacial stiffnesses. Especially, the phase velocity mismatching between the primary SH mode and the DFLM, caused by the degradation of interface (with respect to the case of the perfect interface), can remarkably influence the efficiency of second-harmonic generation by the primary SH mode propagation. The potential is discussed of using the effect of second-harmonic generation by the primary SH mode propagation to evaluate the interfacial properties of layered structures. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.

As in the case of generation of the second harmonic of the Lamb mode in a solid plate with two free boundaries, in general, the second harmonic arising from the nonlinear interaction of the fundamental wave does not grow with propagation distance. However, this article shows that the second harmonic due to the bulk nonlinearities of the two materials both of the solid plate and the liquid layer can cumulate with the propagation distance once certain conditions are satisfied. The analytical solution of the cumulative second harmonic has been formally determined satisfying boundary and initial conditions of excitation. Numerical analyses show the distortion of cumulative second-harmonic field patterns as well as the dependence of cumulative second-harmonic field patterns on the position of excitation source. The technique of analysis in this article yields the novel physical insight into the process of generation of the cumulative second harmonic of the Lamb mode in a solid plate contacting a liquid layer.

0041428116	Study of second-harmonic generation of shear horizontal modes using modal analysis	In this work a modal analysis was employed to study generation of the second harmonics of shear horizontal (SH) modes in a solid plate. Under second order perturbation, second-harmonic generation will occur accompanying SH mode propagation due to the bulk elastic non-linearity of plate material. In solid plate the total second-harmonic fields of a SH mode propagation are regarded as sum of the fields of a series of double frequency Lamb modes (DFLMs). The contribution of each DFLM component to the total second-harmonic fields is dependent of the difference of phase velocities of the corresponding DFLM and SH mode. The analysis results show that the DFLM field component may have cumulative growth effect once its phase velocity exactly or approximately equals that of a SH mode. It is also found that the fields of the total second harmonics of a SH mode are only symmetrical. The examples of field distributions of several DFLMs on the plate surface are considered.

Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation indicate that the reflected second-harmonic amplitude increases sensitively with the increase in the nonlinear acoustic parameter of the plate material at some specific frequencies where the linear reflection coefficient of the normally incident longitudinal wave takes on the minimum value, and that it is independent of the spatial separation between the transmitter/receiver and the solid plate. The results obtained provide a means through which the early state of fatigue-induced damage of the solid plate (characterized by its nonlinear acoustic parameter) can be sensitively assessed by measuring the reflected second harmonic at the specific frequency where the linear reflection coefficient is minimum. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84901237879	Modal expansion analyses of ultrasonic Lamb waves generated by electromagnetic ultrasonic transducers	A modal expansion approach has been proposed for investigating generation of ultrasonic Lamb waves with electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs). Based on the current distribution of the EMAT's meandering coil, the formal solution for Lorentz shear stress applied on the aluminum plate surface has been derived. Then the function of the wave-number spectral density of surface driving stress for generating ultrasonic Lamb waves can be obtained using the spatial Fourier transform. On this basis, with the modal expansion approach for waveguide excitation, the mathematical expression of Lamb wave's mode expansion coefficient has been deduced, which is closely related with the geometrical parameters of the EMAT's meandering coil. The mathematical relationship between Lamb wave's mode expansion coefficient and the EMAT's geometrical parameters, obtained in this paper, lays a theoretical foundation for exactly analyzing generation of Lamb waves with EMATs. Further, the numerical analyses performed indicate that the Lamb wave's mode expansion coefficient can be appropriately adjusted by changing the geometrical parameters of the EMAT's coil, and thus the unwanted Lamb wave modes can be effectively restrained. This result provides a theoretical basis for generating a single and pure Lamb wave mode with EMATs.

84901996599	Experimental observation of cumulative second-harmonic generation of lamb waves propagating in long bones	The experimental observation of cumulative second-harmonic generation of fundamental Lamb waves in long bones is reported. Based on the modal expansion approach to waveguide excitation and the dispersion characteristics of Lamb waves in long bones, the mechanism underlying the generation and accumulation of second harmonics by propagation of the fundamental Lamb waves was investigated. An experimental setup was established to detect the second-harmonic signals of Lamb wave propagation in long bones invitro. Through analysis of the group velocities of the received signals, the appropriate fundamental Lamb wave modes and the duration of the second-harmonic signals could be identified. The integrated amplitude of the time-domain second-harmonic signal was introduced and used to characterize the efficiency of second-harmonic generation by fundamental Lamb wave propagation. The results indicate that the second-harmonic signal generated by fundamental Lamb waves propagating in long bones can be observed clearly, and the effect was cumulative with propagation distance when the fundamental Lamb wave mode and the double-frequency Lamb wave mode had the same phase velocities. The present results may be important in the development of a new method to evaluate the status of long bones using the cumulative second harmonic of ultrasonic Lamb waves. © 2014 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

84903603158	Thermal degradation evaluation of HP40Nb alloy steel after long term service using a nonlinear ultrasonic technique	Nonlinear ultrasonic analysis has been proposed to characterize the thermal degradation of HP40Nb steel associated with microstructure evolution. Measurements of ultrasonic nonlinear signals were performed in the thermally degraded damaged HP40Nb specimens and the results showed a clear change of increase-plateau-decrease tendency of the normalized nonlinear parameter with respect to the different thermal loading time. Based on metallographic studies, the variation in the measured acoustic nonlinearity reveals that the normalized acoustic nonlinearity increases due to the increases of the second phase precipitates and dislocation density in the early stage and it decreases as a combined result of the reduction of dislocation density, coarsening of precipitates and initiation of micro-voids after long-term high temperature exposure. Moreover, an analytical model calculation of precipitate-dislocation interaction has been performed to interpret the correlation between microstructural evolutions and the measured ultrasonic nonlinearity. Consequently, ultrasonic nonlinearity is found to be strongly sensitive to the microstructure evolutions during thermal degradation of HP40Nb steels. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

10044258881	Modal analysis of second-harmonic generation of generalized Lamb waves in layered planar structures	This research has developed an approach for studying second-harmonic generation of generalized Lamb waves (GLWs) in layered planar structures. On the basis of a modal analysis approach and second-order perturbation treatment, an effective theoretical model has been established. The material non-linearity can result in second-harmonic generation by primary GLWs propagating in layered structures, and the non-linearity is treated as a second-order perturbation of the elastic response of primary GLW propagation. There are second-order bulk and surface/interface driving sources in layered planar structures when primary GLWs propagate. These driving sources can be thought of as the forcing functions of a series of double frequency GLWs (DFGLWs) in terms of the approach of modal expansion analysis of guided waves. The total second-harmonic displacement fields consist of a series of DFGLWs in the stress-free layered structures. Thus, the complicated problem of second-harmonic generation of GLWs can be determined exactly within the second-order perturbation regime. Despite the strongly dispersive nature of primary GLWs in layered planar structures, it is found that the second harmonics of primary GLWs can grow with propagation distance along layered structures when the phase velocities of the DFGLWs are equal to those of the primary GLWs. Also, the formal solution of the second harmonics of the primary GLWs are presented. Numerical simulations were performed to understand the physical process of second-harmonic generation by primary GLW propagation in layered structures. The potential application of the present results to practical inspections of layered structures is discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

12844281828	Experimental observation of cumulative second-harmonic generation of Lamb-wave propagation in an elastic plate	The experimental observation of cumulative second-harmonic generation of the primary (fundamental) Lamb-wave propagation is reported in this paper. Using the dispersion relations for Lamb waves and the modal expansion analysis approach for waveguide excitation, a straightforward model has been presented for analysing the physical process of generation of the time-domain pulses of the second harmonics by the fundamental time-domain pulses of the primary Lamb-wave propagation. The physical meaning of the integrated amplitudes, both of the fundamental waves and the second harmonics, is clearly illustrated. Wedge transducers are used to generate and detect the fundamental waves and the second harmonics of the Lamb-wave propagation on the surface of an elastic plate. The clear second-harmonic signals can be observed near the frequency at which Lamb waves have a strong nonlinearity. The amplitudes of the fundamental waves and the second harmonics of the Lamb-wave propagation on the plate surface are measured for different separations between the transmitting and receiving wedge transducers. In the immediate vicinity of a driving frequency at which the fundamental and the double-frequency Lamb waves have the same phase velocities, the quantitative relationships between the second-harmonic amplitudes and propagation distance are analysed. It is observed that the second harmonics of primary Lamb waves grow with propagation distance.
