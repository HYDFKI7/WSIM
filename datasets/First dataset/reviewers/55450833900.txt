84930571802	A new sampling scheme for developing metamodels with the zeros of Chebyshev polynomials	The accuracy of metamodelling is determined by both the sampling and approximation. This article proposes a new sampling method based on the zeros of Chebyshev polynomials to capture the sampling information effectively. First, the zeros of one-dimensional Chebyshev polynomials are applied to construct Chebyshev tensor product (CTP) sampling, and the CTP is then used to construct high-order multi-dimensional metamodels using the hypercube polynomials. Secondly, the CTP sampling is further enhanced to develop Chebyshev collocation method (CCM) sampling, to construct the simplex polynomials. The samples of CCM are randomly and directly chosen from the CTP samples. Two widely studied sampling methods, namely the Smolyak sparse grid and Hammersley, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sampling method. Several numerical examples are utilized to validate the approximation accuracy of the proposed metamodel under different dimensions.

The Polynomial-Chaos-Chebyshev-Interval (PCCI) method is used to realize the expansion, which is able to settle the random uncertainty and interval uncertainty in an integral framework. The proposed hybrid uncertainty optimization will be compared with the traditional deterministic optimization and the random uncertainty optimization through a structure design optimization problem.

1442290407	Combinatorial optimal design of number and positions of actuators in actively controlled structures using genetic algorithms	In this paper, the optimal design of the numbers and positions of actuators in actively controlled structures is formulated as a three-level optimal design problem. Features of this design problem such as discreteness, multi-modality and hierarchical structure are discussed. A two-level genetic algorithm (TLGA) is proposed for solving this problem. The concept, principle and solution process of the TLGA are described. A case study is presented, in which a building is subjected to earthquake excitation and controlled by active tendon actuators. The results of this study show that: (1) the design problem for optimizing number and configuration of actuators simultaneously in actively controlled structures has the features of non-linearity, mixed-discreteness and multi-modality; (2) a three-level design model can give a reasonable description for this kind of design problem; (3) TLGA is an effective algorithm for solving the combinatorial optimization problem. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

33750509151	Modelling of a magneto-rheological damper by evolving radial basis function networks	This paper presents an approach to approximate the forward and inverse dynamic behaviours of a magneto-rheological (MR) damper using evolving radial basis function (RBF) networks. Due to the highly nonlinear characteristics of MR dampers, modelling of MR dampers becomes a very important problem to their applications. In this paper, an alternative representation of the MR damper in terms of evolving RBF networks, which have a structure of four input neurons and one output neuron to emulate the forward and inverse dynamic behaviours of an MR damper, respectively, is developed by combining the genetic algorithms (GAs) to search for the network centres with other standard learning algorithms. Training and validating of the evolving RBF network models are achieved by using the data generated from the numerical simulation of the nonlinear differential equations proposed for the MR damper. It is shown by the validation tests that the evolving RBF networks can represent both forward and inverse dynamic behaviours of the MR damper satisfactorily. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40549120649	Investigation into untripped rollover of light vehicles in the modified fishhook and the sine maneuvers. Part I: Vehicle modelling, roll and yaw instability	Vehicle rollovers may occur under steering-only maneuvers because of roll or yaw instability. In this paper, the modified fishhook and the sine maneuvers are used to investigate a vehicle's rollover resistance capability through simulation. A 9-degrees of freedom (DOF) vehicle model is first developed for the investigation. The vehicle model includes the roll, yaw, pitch, and bounce modes and passive independent suspensions. It is verified with the existing 3-DOF roll-yaw model. A rollover critical factor (RCF) quantifying a vehicle's rollover resistance capability is then constructed based on the static stability factor (SSF) and taking into account the influence of other key dynamic factors. Simulation results show that the vehicle with certain parameters will rollover during the fishhook maneuver because of roll instability; however, the vehicle with increased suspension stiffness, which does not rollover during the fishhook maneuver, may exceed its rollover resistance limit because of yaw instability during the sine maneuver. Typically, rollover in the sine maneuver happens after several cycles. It has been found that the proposed RCF well quantifies the rollover resistance capability of a vehicle for the two specified maneuvers. In general, the larger the RCF, the more kinetically stable is a vehicle. A vehicle becomes unstable when its RCF is less than zero. Detailed discussion on the effects of key vehicle system parameters and drive conditions on the RCF in the fishhook and the sine maneuver is presented in Part II of this study.

0034275262	Modelling of structural response and optimization of structural control system using neural network and genetic algorithm	This paper proposes an integrated approach to the modelling and optimization of structural control systems in tall buildings. In this approach, an artificial neural network is applied to model the structural dynamic responses of tall buildings subjected to strong earthquakes, and a genetic algorithm is used to optimize the design problem of structural control systems, which constitutes a mixed-discrete, nonlinear and multi-modal optimization problem. The neural network model of the structural dynamic response analysis is included in the genetic algorithm and is used as a module of the structural analysis to estimate the dynamic responses of tall buildings. A numerical example is presented in which the general regression neural network is used to model the structural response analysis. The modelling method, procedure and the numerical results are discussed. Two Los Angeles earthquake records are adopted as earthquake excitations.

84877764657	Interaction between wedge disclination dipoles and core-shell nanowires with interface effects	In order to understand the influence of disclinations on mechanical properties of nanostructured composite materials, the interaction between a wedge disclination dipole and core-shell nanowires with interface effects is investigated. By using the complex variable method, the analytical solutions of complex potentials are derived for the interaction of a wedge disclination dipole and a core-shell nanowire considering interface effects. The stress fields, the elastic strain energy and the force acting on the wedge disclination dipole center are obtained. The influence of the feature of disclination dipole, the nanoscale coating thickness, the uniform eigenstrain and the material elastic dissimilarity on the equilibrium location and the stability of the dipole is studied when the size of the core-shell nanowire is reduced to nanometer scale. The results show that the impact of interface stresses on the equilibrium and the motion of the dipole near the core-shell nanowire is significant, namely, interface stresses have important effect on the strengthening and toughening of the nanostructured composite materials. The material properties of coating layer are dominant factors in the influence of the equilibrium location and the stability of disclination dipole for serious mismatch (i.e. very hard or very soft) and/or thick coating layer. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The choice of gear ratio has significant influence on vehicle performance, including range, acceleration, and gradeability. To study the impact of different transmissions on EV's dynamic and economic performance, mathematical models of an EV is presented which is applicable to both single and multiple ratio transmissions.

48349087809	Parameter-dependent input-delayed control of uncertain vehicle suspensions	This paper presents a parameter-dependent controller design approach for vehicle active suspensions to deal with changes in vehicle inertial properties and existence of actuator time delays. By defining a parameter-dependent Lyapunov functional, matrix inequality conditions with reduced conservatism are obtained for the design of controllers. Feasible solutions can be obtained by solving a finite number of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) embedded within a genetic algorithm (GA). Both state feedback and static output feedback controllers can be designed under a unified framework. Based on the measurement or estimation of the vehicle inertial parameters, a parameter-dependent controller could be implemented in practice. The presented approach is applied to a two-degree-of-freedom quarter-car suspension model. Numerical simulations on both bump and random road responses show that the designed parameter-dependent controllers can achieve good active suspension performance regardless of the variation on the sprung mass and the presence of actuator time delay. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Two control algorithms, optimal control and acceleration feedback control, are used as the control algorithms. A multi-level optimization model is proposed with respect to the solution procedure of the optimum problem.

77953762813	Stabilizing vehicle lateral dynamics with considerations of parameter uncertainties and control saturation through robust yaw control	This paper presents a robust yaw-moment controller design for improving vehicle handling and stability with considerations of parameter uncertainties and control saturation. The parameter uncertainties dealt with are the changes of vehicle mass and moment of inertia about the yaw axis and the variations of cornering stiffnesses. The control saturation considered is due to the physical limitations of actuators and tires. Both polytopic and norm-bounded approaches are used to describe parameter uncertainties, and a norm-bounded approach is applied to handle the saturation nonlinearity. The conditions for designing such a controller are derived as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A nonlinear vehicle model is utilized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The simulation results show that the designed controller can improve vehicle handling and stability, regardless of the changes in vehicle mass and moment of inertia and the variations of road surfaces and saturation limitations. © 2010 IEEE.

Firstly, wavelet transform was used to analyse the structural acceleration response data, which includes the moment when the bolt looseness occurred. An obvious step leap along the time axis, which shows the time when the bolt looseness occurs, can be clearly observed in the level-1 details of the wavelet decomposition. Secondly, ARX (auto-regression with exogenous inputs) model was constructed from the measured input and output signals, then the statistical indices of the model residual error were defined as the damage characteristic parameter indicating the severity and location of the loose bolts in the clamping support. The experimental study shows that the extracted characteristic parameter in this paper can be more appropriate than measuring the base frequency for monitoring the bolts looseness at early stage.

Numerical studies are conducted on a five-layer piezoelectric plate and the complexity of stresses and deformations under combined loading is illustrated. The results presented here could be used as a benchmark for assessing any numerical solution by approximate approaches such as the finite element method while also providing useful physical insight into the behavior of piezoelectric plates in thermal environment. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0036605392	Field measurements of amplitude-dependent damping in a 79-storey tall building and its effects on the structural dynamic responses	This paper describes some results obtained from full-scale measurements of wind effects on a super-tall building, Di-Wang Tower, located in Shenzhen, China. This tall building has 79-storeys with a height of approximately 324 m. Field measurements including wind speed, wind direction and wind-induced acceleration responses have been made. The amplitude-dependent characteristics of damping are obtained by using the random decrement technique from the detailed analysis of the field acceleration measurements. The main objective of this paper is to present detailed investigations into the effects of nonlinear damping on the dynamic responses of the tall building subjected to various types of applied loads based on the measured amplitude-dependent damping characteristics. The predicted dynamic responses of the building obtained by using the measured damping characteristics were compared with those computed by using constant damping parameters assumed by the structural designers. It is concluded from the investigations that knowledge of actual damping characteristics are very important in the accurate prediction of the dynamic responses of a tall building when the major harmonic components of the applied loads overlap with the lowest natural frequencies of the building. The design damping level for tall building structures currently used by structural engineering practitioners appears to be high and not conservative.

79957869413	Experimental verification of stick-slip motion between two rolling contact surfaces	In this paper, a simplified drive train model with stick-slip nonlinearity is introduced for the study of stick-slip motion between the driving tires and the flywheel. Laboratory based tests are designed to investigate stick-slip motion of the tires contacting with the flywheels which simulate vehicle inertia. A description of the powertrain test rig, the associated instrumentation, the test inputs and operation conditions are provided. The experimental results are similar to those obtained from the numerical analysis using the introduced drive train model. They verify the validity of the stick-slip model, and demonstrate that stick-slip occurred frequently between the driving tires and the flywheels. The normal tire force applied to the flywheel is one of the key parameters affecting stick-slip motion. And there exists an upper limit beyond which the tire and flywheel will stick together at all time. It is found that the frequency of stick-slip motion is independent of normal tire force and is close to the natural frequency of the tire-flywheel contacting power transmitting system. © 2011 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84255195542	Robust sampled-data control of structures subject to parameter uncertainties and actuator saturation	This paper presents a robust sampled-data controller design approach for vibration attenuation of civil structures considering parameter uncertainties and actuator saturation. The parameter uncertainties belong to polytopic form and are assumed to be the variations of the structural stiffness and damping. Regarding the uncertain sampling problem encountered in real world applications, the sampling period designed for the controller is allowed to be variable within a given bound. In order to obtain reduced peak response quantities, the energy-to-peak performance used to describe the peak values of the control output under all possible energy-bounded disturbances is optimised. The robust sampled-data state feedback controller is obtained in terms of the solvability of certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated by a numerical example on vibration control of a building structure subject to seismic excitation. It is validated by the simulation results confirming that the designed controllers can effectively attenuate the structural vibration and keep the system stability while there are parameter uncertainties and actuator saturation constraints. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84859024153	A physically meaningful level set method for topology optimization of structures	This paper aims to present a physically meaningful level set method for shape and topology optimization of structures. Compared to the conventional level set method which represents the design boundary as the zero level set, in this study the boundary is embedded into non-zero constant level sets of the level set function, to implicitly implement shape fidelity and topology changes in time via the propagation of the discrete level set function. A point-wise nodal density field, non-negative and value-bounded, is used to parameterize the level set function via the compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs) at a uniformly defined set of knots. The set of densities are used to interpolate practical material properties in finite element approximation via the standard Lagrangian shape function. CSRBFs knots are supposed to be consistent with finite element nodes only for the sake of numerical simplicity. By doing so, the discrete values of the level set function are assigned with practical material properties via the physically meaningful interpolation. The original more difficult shape and topology optimization of the Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (PDEs) is transformed to a relatively easier size optimization of the nodal densities, to which more efficient optimization algorithms can be directly applied. In this way, the dynamic motion of the design boundary is just a question of transporting the discrete level set function until the optimal criteria of the structure is satisfied. Two widely studied examples are applied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Copyright © 2012 Tech Science Press.

84859818673	Two-to-one resonant hopf bifurcations in a quadratically nonlinear oscillator involving time delay	The trivial equilibrium of a weakly nonlinear oscillator having quadratic nonlinearities under a delayed feedback control can change its stability via a single Hopf bifurcation as the time delay increases. Double Hopf bifurcation occurs when the characteristic equation has two pairs of purely imaginary solutions. An interaction of resonant HopfHopf bifurcations may be possible when the two critical time delays corresponding to the two Hopf bifurcations have the same value. With the aid of normal form theory and centre manifold theorem as well as the method of multiple scales, the present paper studies the dynamics of a quadratically nonlinear oscillator involving time delay in the vicinity of the point of two-to-one resonances of HopfHopf bifurcations. The ratio of the frequencies of two Hopf bifurcations is numerically found to be nearly equal to two. The two resonant Hopf bifurcations can generate two respective periodic solutions. Consequently, the centre manifold corresponding to these two solutions is determined by a set of four first-order differential equations under two-to-one internal resonances. It is shown that the amplitudes of the two bifurcating periodic solutions admit the trivial solution and two-mode solutions for the averaged equations on the centre manifolds. Correspondingly, the cumulative behavior of the original nonlinear oscillator exhibits the initial equilibrium and a quasi-periodic motion having two frequencies. Illustrative examples are given to show the unstable zero solution, stable zero solution, and stable two-mode solution of the nonlinear oscillator under the two-to-one resonant HopfHopf interactions. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84859872845	A meshfree level-set method for topological shape optimization of compliant multiphysics actuators	This paper proposes a topology optimization method for compliant multiphysics actuators of geometrically nonlinear structures using meshfree Galerkin weak-forms and level set methods. The design boundary is implicitly represented as the zero level set of a higher-dimensional level set function, leading to a level set model capable of handling complex shape and topological changes with flexibilities. A family of compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs) is firstly used to interpolate the level set function of Lipschitz continuity, and then augmented to construct the shape function for meshless approximation by satisfying basic requirements, in particular the predetermined consistency and the Kronecker delta function property. A meshless Galerkin method (MGM) with global weak-forms is established to implement the discretization of the state equations. The design of actuators is transformed into an easier size optimization from a more difficult shape and topology optimization. The design boundary evolution is just a question of advancing the discrete level set function in time by updating the design variables of the size optimization. Compared to most conventional level set methods, the proposed meshless level set method is able to implement the free moving boundary discontinuities without remeshing, and unify two different numerical procedures in propagating the discrete level set function (e.g. Eulerian grid) and approximating the state equation (e.g. Lagrangian mesh), respectively. This method can also avoid numerical difficulties in solving a series of complicate Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (PDEs) with explicit time schemes. Two typical numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the transfer matrix method, the impedance matrix of hydraulic subsystem is derived, and the mechanical and hydraulic coupled multi-body dynamic equations are then obtained. An eigenvalue iteration identification method for frequency dependent system characteristic equation is developed based on numerical optimization, and the validity of this method is then verified. By applying the theory of complex mode, the comparison analysis of vibration of sprung mass is carried out between the tri-axle truck with a convention suspension and that fitted with the hydraulically interconnected suspension system. The obtained results indicate that the anti-oppositional hydraulically interconnected suspension system is able to effectively reduce the pitch motion of sprung mass in pitch plane, and simultaneously maintain the ride comfort performance. The pitch stiffness is increased while the bounce stiffness is slightly softened. The peak values of sprung mass and wheel hop motions are greatly reduced, and the vibration decay rate of sprung mass is also significantly increased. © 2012 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

84860498205	A multi-criteria topology optimization for systematic design of compliant mechanisms	This paper attempts to present a new multi-criteria topological optimization methodology for the systematic design of compliant micro-mechanisms. Instead of employing only the strain energy (SE) or the functional specifications such as mechanical efficiency (ME), in this study an alternative formulation representing multiple design requirements is included in the optimization to describe the performance of compliant mechanisms. In most conventional designs, SE is used to only measure the design requirement from the point of view of structures, while ME is usually applied to describe the mechanical performance of mechanisms. However, the design of a compliant mechanism is required to comprehensively consider both the structural and mechanical performance quantities. Displacement, material usage and dynamic response are imposed as three external constraints to narrow the searching domain. In doing so, the multi-criteria optimization problem involving the SE and ME can reasonably embody the mechanical structural characteristics of compliant mechanisms. A sequential convex programming, the method of moving asymptotes (MMA), is applied to solve the topological optimization problem, which can not only ensure numerical accuracy but also both the monotonous and non-monotonous structural behaviors. SIMP model (solid isotropic material with penalization) is used to indicate the dependence of elastic modulus upon regularized element densities. Several typical numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, and the prototype of a resulting mechanism has also been manufactured to validate the design of the compliant mechanism.

84867655227	Design of compliant mechanisms using meshless level set methods	This paper presents a meshless Galerkin level-set method (MGLSM) for shape and topology optimization of compliant mechanisms of geometrically nonlinear structures. The design boundary of the mechanism is implicitly described as the zero level set of a Lipschitz continuous level set function of higher dimension. The moving least square (MLS) approximation is used to construct the meshless shape functions with the global Galerkin weak-form in terms of a set of arbitrarily distributed nodes. The MLS shape function is first employed to parameterize the level set function via the surface fitting rather than interpolation, and then used to implement the meshless approximations of the discrete state equations. Since the MLS shape function lacks of Kronecker delta function property, a constrained Galerkin global weak-form using the penalty method is applied to enforce the essential boundary conditions. In this way, the shape and topology optimization of the design boundary is just a question of advancing the discrete level set function in time by updating the unknown parameters for the parameterized size optimization. Compared to most conventional level set methods, the proposed MGLSM is able to (1) propagate the discrete level set function and solve the state equations at the same time with one unified set of meshes, (2) avoid numerical difficulties in solving the complicate Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (PDEs), and (3) describe the implicit moving boundaries without remeshing for discontinuities. A benchmark numerical example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Copyright © 2012 Tech Science Press.

84869753986	Modelling and characteristic analysis of tri-Axle trucks with hydraulically interconnected suspensions	In this paper, a new hydraulically interconnected suspension (HIS) system is proposed for the implementation of a resistance control for the pitch and bounce modes of tri-Axle heavy trucks. A lumped-mass half-truck model is established using the free-body diagram method. The equations of motion of a mechanical and hydraulic coupled system are developed by incorporating the hydraulic strut forces into the mechanical subsystem as externally applied forces. The transfer matrix method (TMM) is used to evaluate the impedance matrix of the hydraulic subsystem consisting of models of fluid pipes, damper valves, accumulators, and three-way junctions. The TMM is further applied to find the quantitative relationships between the hydraulic strut forces and boundary flow of the mechanical-fluid interactive subsystem. The modal analysis method is employed to perform the vibration analysis between the trucks with the conventional suspension and the proposed HIS. Comparison analysis focuses on free vibration with identified eigenvalues and eigenvectors, isolation vibration capacity, and force vibration in terms of the power spectrum density responses. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed HIS system in reducing the pitch motion of sprung mass and simultaneously maintaining the ride comfort. The pitch stiffness is increased while the bounce stiffness is slightly softened. The peak values of sprung mass and wheel hop motions are greatly reduced, and the vibration decay rate of sprung mass is also significantly increased. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84871335820	Study on the time lag between steering input and vehicle lateral acceleration response under different key vehicle parameters	A passively suspended road vehicle rolls outwards under the influence of lateral acceleration when cornering, which is very dangerous under large lateral acceleration. In this paper, time lag between steering input and vehicle lateral acceleration response is systematically studied to implement the active roll control algorithm from the viewpoint of vehicle system dynamics. A 3 DOF yaw-roll vehicle model is established based on vehicle lateral, roll and yaw dynamics. Vehicle parameters of a 1997 Jeep Cherokee is used for parametric study, where the influences of vehicle velocity, steering frequency, mass, length, roll, yaw moment of inertia, position of vehicle centre of gravity, and tyre cornering stiffness are studied via numerical simulation.

84873249383	A modified two-variable expansion method for a nonlinear Jerk equation	A modified two-variable expansion method was used to determine approximate frequencies and approximate analytical periodic solutions to a third-order differential equation with cubic nonlinearterms. This method combining Lindstedt-Poincare technique and the two-variable expansion method was not only valid for weakly nonlinear oscillations but also for strongly nonlinear oscillations. Here, a nonlinear Jerk equation excluding linear part of velocity term as an example was calculated. Its second-order approximate period and second-order approximate analytical periodic solution were obtained. A comparison of the first and second approximate analytical periodic solutions with the numerically exact solutions showed that the second order approximate analytical periodic solution is much more accurate than the first one. The result showed that the modified two-variable expansion method is suitable for solving a nonlinear Jerk equation, moreover, when the Jerk equation doesn't have linear part of velocity term, this method is still effective.

84878330886	An uncertain multidisciplinary design optimization method using interval convex models	This article proposes an uncertain multi-objective multidisciplinary design optimization methodology, which employs the interval model to represent the uncertainties of uncertain-but-bounded parameters. The interval number programming method is applied to transform each uncertain objective function into two deterministic objective functions, and a satisfaction degree of intervals is used to convert both the uncertain inequality and equality constraints to deterministic inequality constraints. In doing so, an unconstrained deterministic optimization problem will be constructed in association with the penalty function method. The design will be finally formulated as a nested three-loop optimization, a class of highly challenging problems in the area of engineering design optimization. An advanced hierarchical optimization scheme is developed to solve the proposed optimization problem based on the multidisciplinary feasible strategy, which is a well-studied method able to reduce the dimensions of multidisciplinary design optimization problems by using the design variables as independent optimization variables. In the hierarchical optimization system, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, sequential quadratic programming method and Gauss-Seidel iterative approach are applied to the outer, middle and inner loops of the optimization problem, respectively. Typical numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84878763317	Design of Hydraulically Interconnected Suspension Systems for Tri-axle Straight Trucks with Rear Tandem Axle Bogie Suspensions	This study has proposed a new roll-resistant hydraulically interconnected suspension (HIS) system for a tri-axle straight truck with rear tandem axle bogie suspension to suppress the roll motion of truck body. The equations of motion of the mechanical and hydraulic coupling system are established by incorporating the hydraulic forces as external forces into the mechanical subsystem, in which the hydraulic forces are derived using impedance transfer matrix method and related to the state vectors of mechanical subsystem at the boundaries. Based on the derived equations of the coupling system, modal analysis method is employed to investigate the dynamic characteristics, including natural frequencies, mode shapes and dynamic responses. The results indicate that the proposed HIS system can effectively enhance the natural frequencies of truck body pitch and roll modes, and significantly increase the mode damping. The mode shapes of truck body are also changed. The study of dynamic response indicates that the amplitudes corresponding to the oscillation frequencies of truck body and wheel hop modes are heavily restrained. The proposed HIS system is also able to favorably adjust the dynamic load distribution among wheel stations. Furthermore, parametric analysis shows that natural frequencies of truck with HIS system depend on piston surface areas and installation schematics of actuators. Tire dynamic load coefficients can be favorable changed by adjusting the loss coefficients of damper valves. © 2013 SAE International.

Based on the finite element method, the liquid-filled pipe and a supporting structure are firstly modeled respectively. The obtained two sub-system models are then combined using their common nodes displacement. Based on the combined system, the coupled vibration characteristics of the liquid-filled pipe and the supporting structure system are analyzed. The analysis results show that, the strong coupling vibration modes are existed in the support structure and liquid-filled pipe system. If we change the mass and stiffness of pipe, some orders of vibration performance will change obviously, especially for those controlled by the pipe. However, for the vibration decided by the support structure, it is uselessly to change the mass matrix or stiffness matrix of the pipe. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84880526685	Modelling and simulation of gear synchronisation and shifting in dual-clutch transmission equipped powertrains	Dual-clutch transmissions have increased in prevalence through the combination of high efficiency and shift quality. This is achieved through the automation of conventional manual transmission synchronisers for gear selection with automated clutch-to-clutch shift control, minimising loss of traction to the road. This article derives a suitably detailed model of a dual-clutch transmission equipped powertrain for the transient simulation and analysis of combined synchroniser engagement and gear shifts. Models are derived for a powertrain equipped with a wet dual-clutch transmission with particular focus on a detailed synchroniser mechanism model, including speed synchronisation, ring unblocking and indexing stages of engagement. To demonstrate the combination of synchroniser engagement with clutch-to-clutch shifting, several simulations are conducted to study the variation of chamfer alignment, vehicle speed and synchroniser engagement timing on powertrain response. Results indicate that vehicle speed and chamfer alignment have only limited impact on the quality of shifting. Synchroniser timing can have a more significant influence on shift quality, stressing the need for independence of these processes. © IMechE 2012.

84880606903	Interval uncertain method for multibody mechanical systems using Chebyshev inclusion functions	This study proposes a new uncertain analysis method for multibody dynamics of mechanical systems based on Chebyshev inclusion functions The interval model accounts for the uncertainties in multibody mechanical systems comprising uncertain-but-bounded parameters, which only requires lower and upper bounds of uncertain parameters, without having to know probability distributions. A Chebyshev inclusion function based on the truncated Chebyshev series, rather than the Taylor inclusion function, is proposed to achieve sharper and tighter bounds for meaningful solutions of interval functions, to effectively handle the overestimation caused by the wrapping effect, intrinsic to interval computations. The Mehler integral is used to evaluate the coefficients of Chebyshev polynomials in the numerical implementation. The multibody dynamics of mechanical systems are governed by index-3 differential algebraic equations (DAEs), including a combination of differential equations and algebraic equations, responsible for the dynamics of the system subject to certain constraints. The proposed interval method with Chebyshev inclusion functions is applied to solve the DAEs in association with appropriate numerical solvers. This study employs HHT-I3 as the numerical solver to transform the DAEs into a series of nonlinear algebraic equations at each integration time step, which are solved further by using the Newton-Raphson iterative method at the current time step. Two typical multibody dynamic systems with interval parameters, the slider crank and double pendulum mechanisms, are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results show that the proposed methodology can supply sufficient numerical accuracy with a reasonable computational cost and is able to effectively handle the wrapping effect, as cosine functions are incorporated to sharpen the range of non-monotonic interval functions. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A H∞ static output feedback controller which only uses measurable variables as feedback signals is designed to improve vehicle ride comfort performance in terms of driver head acceleration under constraints of actuator saturation, suspension deflection limitation and road holding capability. The controller design conditions, which are expressed as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) are derived by dealing with each control input separately under a common Lyapunov function, so that a feasible solution can be found for the integrated high order system that has five control inputs and ten control outputs; each control input may require different feedback signals and have different saturation limitations. Furthermore, a semiactive control strategy is applied to implement the proposed control system using electrorheological (ER) dampers. Numerical simulations are used to evaluate theimprovement of ride comfort performance in terms of driver head acceleration responses under typical road disturbances.

To reduce the energy consumption of the active system, the control has to be made less ambitious. Selecting the dominant vehicle motion-mode as control objectives in real time is considered as an effective strategy to balance the energy consumption with the control performance. The modeling of the vehicle dynamic suspension is discussed first. Then a motion-mode detection method and the switching control strategy are developed. And then, three fuzzy controllers are designed for the vehicle body bounce, pitch and roll motion-modes, respectively. Finally, simulation on the full-car suspension model is performed to validate the proposed study. The obtained results indicate that the designed controllers can effectively reduce the pitch motion and prevent rollover, and simultaneously achieve good suspension performance. © 2013 IEEE.

84893711287	Modelling, simulations, and optimisation of electric vehicles for analysis of transmission ratio selection	Pure electric vehicles (PEVs) provide a unique problem in powertrain design through the meeting of performance specifications whilst maximising driving range. The consideration of single speed and multispeed transmissions for electric vehicles provides two strategies for achieving desired range and performance specifications. Through the implementation of system level vehicle models, design analysis, and optimisation, this paper analyses the application of both single speed and two-speed transmission applications to electric vehicles. Initially, transmission ratios are designed based on grade and top speed requirements, and impact on vehicle traction curve is evaluated. Then performance studies are conducted for different transmission ratios using both single speed and two-speed powertrain configurations to provide a comparative assessment of the vehicles. Finally, multivariable optimisation in the form of genetic algorithms is employed to determine an optimal gear ratio selection for single speed and two-speed PEVs. Results demonstrate that the two-speed transmission is capable of achieving better results for performance requirements over a single speed transmission, including vehicle acceleration and grade climbing. However, the lower powertrain efficiency reduces the simulated range results. © 2013 Paul D. Walker et al.

84896760113	Topological shape optimization of microstructural metamaterials using a level set method	Metamaterials usually refer to artificial composite materials consisting of an array of periodically arranged microstructures, engineered to provide unusual material properties that may not be easily found in nature. This paper proposes a new topological shape optimization method for systematic computational design of a type of mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic materials), which integrates the numerical homogenization approach into a powerful parametric level set method (PLSM). The homogenization method is used to obtain the effective properties of the periodic microstructure, while the PLSM is applied to achieve shape evolutions and topological changes of the microstructure, until the desired material properties are achieved. The key concept of the PLSM is the interpolation of the implicit level set surface by using a given set of compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBF), which are positioned at a number of given and fixed knots inside the design domain. Several typical numerical examples are used to demonstrate the favorable characteristics of the proposed method in the design of micro-structured metamaterials. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84900406000	Numerical and experimental investigation of drag torque in a two-speed dual clutch transmission	The theoretical analysis of drag torques within a two-speed dual clutch transmission is presented in this article. The numerical models are developed to study the different sources of drag torques in dual clutch transmission. Simulations are performed in Matlab/Simulink platform to investigate the variation of drag torques under different operating conditions. Then an experimental investigation is conducted to evaluate the proposed model using an electric vehicle powertrain test rig. Outcomes of experimentation confirm that simulation results agree well with test data. Therefore the proposed model performs well in the prediction of drag torque for the transmission, and can be applied to assess the efficiency of the transmission. Results demonstrate that the entire drag torque is dominated by the viscous shear in the wet clutch pack and gear churning losses. This lays a theoretical foundation to future research on reducing drag torque and applications of drag torque in powertrain system efficiency optimization. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A roll-plane HIS system can directly provide stiffness and damping to vehicle roll motion-mode, in addition to spring and shock absorbers in each wheel station. A four degree-of-freedom (DOF) roll-plane half-car model is employed for this study, which contains four body-wheel motion-modes, including body bounce mode, body roll mode, wheel bounce mode and wheel roll mode. For a half-car model, its dynamic energy contained in the relative motions between its body and wheels is a sum of the energy of these four motion-modes. Numerical examples and full-car experiments are used to illustrate the concept of the effects of HIS on motion-mode energy distribution. The obtained simulation results show that the installed HIS system is able to reduce the energy level in the body-dominated roll motion-mode, and it has negligible effect in the bounce mode. Experimental results match the simulation results well. © 2014 SAE International.

84904786400	An interval uncertain optimization method for vehicle suspensions using Chebyshev metamodels	This paper proposes a new design optimization framework for suspension systems considering the kinematic characteristics, such as the camber angle, caster angle, kingpin inclination angle, and toe angle in the presence of uncertainties. The coordinates of rear inner hardpoints of upper control arm and lower control arm of double wishbone suspension are considered as the design variables, as well as the uncertain parameters. In this way, the actual values of the design variables will vary surrounding their nominal values. The variations result in uncertainties that are described as interval variables with lower and upper bounds. The kinematic model of the suspension is developed in software ADAMS. A high-order response surface model using the zeros of Chebyshev polynomials as sampling points is established, termed as Chebyshev metamodel, to approximate the kinematic model. The Chebyshev meta-model is expected to provide higher approximation accuracy. Interval uncertain optimization problems usually involve a nested computationally expensive double-loop optimization process, in which the inner loop optimization is to calculate the bounds of the interval design functions, while the outer loop is to search the optimum for the deterministic optimization problem. To reduce the computational cost, the interval arithmetic is introduced in the inner loop to improve computational efficiency without compromising numerical accuracy. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed design method. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Through simulation the operating characteristics of the control valve are analyzed, demonstrating that the valve achieves dual functionalities of high flow and accurate pressure control depending on demands. This is realized through the designed force balancing of the valve spool. The dependency of the system to system variables on input pressure and the influence of air content on dynamic response of the valve are investigated. The resilience of output pressure is demonstrated to these variables, indicating strong system reliability. Finally, the model is then validated using in situ experimental testing on a powertrain test rig.

84905011242	Robust tracking control of vehicle lateral dynamics	In this paper, a robust yaw moment controller is designed to improve vehicle handling and stability. Three issues regarding to vehicle mass variation cornering stiffness uncertainty, and tracking control are considered in the controller design process. To deal with these issues, parameter-dependent control strategy, norm-bounded uncertainty description, and tracking error feedback are applied. The control objective is to stabilise the closed-loop system and to optimise the tracking performance on yaw rate and sideslip angle with respect to their targets. The condition for designing such a controller is derived in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI). Numerical simulations on a nonlinear vehicle model are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

84907618752	Investigation into on-road vehicle parameter identification based on subspace methods	The randomness of road-tyre excitations can excite the low frequency ride vibrations of bounce, pitch and roll modes of an on-road vehicle. In this paper, modal parameters and mass moments of inertia of an on-road vehicle are estimated with an acceptable accuracy only by measuring accelerations of vehicle sprung mass and unsprung masses, which is based on subspace identification methods. The vehicle bounce, pitch and roll modes are characterized by their large damping (damping ratio 0.2-0.3). Two kinds of subspace identification methods, one that uses input/output data and the other that uses output data only, are compared for the highly damped modes. It is shown that, when the same data length is given, larger error of modal identification results can be clearly observed for the method using output data only; while additional use of input data will significantly reduce estimation variance. Instead of using tyre forces as inputs, which are difficult to be measured or estimated, vertical accelerations of unsprung masses are used as inputs. Theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo experiments show that, when the vehicle speed is not very high, subspace identification method using accelerations of unsprung masses as inputs can give more accurate results compared with the method using road-tyre forces as inputs. After the modal parameters are identified, and if vehicle mass and its center of gravity are pre-determined, roll and pitch moments of inertia of an on-road vehicle can be directly computed using the identified frequencies only, without requiring accurate estimation of mode shape vectors and multi-variable optimization algorithms.

84907394341	Dynamics and control of gear shifts in a two speed electric vehicle	Electric vehicles have become an alternative to conventional and hybrid electric passenger vehicles, with the capability to provide higher overall powertrain efficiencies through the omission of conventional combustion engines. However, as a result of lower battery energy density as compared to fossil fuels, electric powertrains have limited range capabilities, leading to a phobia of electric vehicles and limited consumer acceptance. Furthermore, small electric motors typically cannot achieve the diverse functionality of conventional vehicles, most particularly for vehicle performance and grade climbing in comparison to vehicle range. As a result, multi-speed transmissions have been suggested as one strategy to improve the powertrain performance and increase the functionality of electric vehicles. By increasing the number of gear ratios the motor can operate under higher efficiencies for a wider range of vehicle speeds. The vehicle can then be designed to operate at a more diverse range of operating conditions, increasing the speed range and torque deliverable at lower speeds. To realise this objective there is a necessity to provide gear shift strategies unique to electric vehicles, delivering high quality gear shifts without relying on conventional vibration isolators such as torque converters or torsional dampers. This paper presents modelling, simulation, and control of a two speed electric vehicle. Demonstrating through enhanced precision of torque estimation and control in the electric machine it is possible to minimise powertrain response during and after gear shift transients, thereby improving driver comfort. The contents of this paper will therefore provide a detailed framework for powertrain modelling with electric vehicles, identify appropriate shift strategies for stepped automatic EVs, integrate these to develop shift control algorithms, and finally provide simulation results for up shift transients. Results demonstrate that it is possible to both improve post shift transient response of the powertrain and reduce the inertia phase of gear shift using the proposed methods.

84907413876	Comparison of interval method and polynomial chaos method for solving dynamics problem with uncertainties	The parameters in most engineering problems are under uncertainty due to manufacturing and assembly tolerances, deviations in loads and other environmental factors, which make the uncertainty of system response too notable to be ignored. Two methods are used to solve uncertain problems in this paper, in which the polynomial chaos method is tailored for random variables while the interval method is used to fit for interval variables. The polynomial chaos method, belonging to a kind of probabilistic methods, can be used to obtain statistic characteristics of the response but requires the statistic information of uncertain parameters. The interval method to be proposed is based on the Runge-Kutta algorithm to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with interval parameters. Taylor inclusion model is included in the numerical implementation, and the Taylor coefficients are calculated through real point iterative process, which is expected to reduce the overestimation intrinsic to interval computations. The vehicle handling problem is used as an engineering application to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In the numerical model, the uncertain parameters are modelled as interval parameters and random parameters, respectively. The results show that: (1) the polynomial chaos method makes the mean value of responses consistent with the Monte Carlo simulation, but the standard deviation of responses exhibits large error; (2) the interval method achieves the bounds of responses which contain the actual results tightly; (3) both the polynomial chaos and interval methods are more computationally effective than the Monte Carlo simulation.

The finite element formulation is derived from the Hellinger-Reissner functional. In the process of the element derivation, the optimization principle of the numerical behaviour of multiple-variable FEM, in which an energy compatible condition is introduced to optimise the unconstrained stress trials, is employed. An appropriate unconstrained stress field is carefully chosen to validate the optimization. Because the transverse shear effect is taken into account, the element can be used for moderately thick and thin plates and shallow shells. Numerical study demonstrates that the present element passes the patch test and is of high accuracy and free of superfluous zero energy deformation modes.
