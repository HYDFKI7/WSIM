33745125356	Approach in early fault features extraction of aero-engine rotor system	A method to detect early fault and extract its features of aero-engine rotor systems with VI (Virtual Instruments) and MT (Matlab Tools) is proposed. It is based on the analysis of early fault of the aero-engine rotor systems. The method is described in detail. The early fault characteristic signal from detected signals and analysis the selection of early fault eigenvalue is extracted, in which useful signal is separated from dominant noise signal. The experiments on the early rub-impact and early unbalance of the aero-engine rotor system is performed and the effectiveness of our method was demonstrated in the following respects: it shows that not only complex calculation can be avoided with VI and MT but also early fault features can be quickly extracted.

33744725915	Exploring effective early identification of aero-engine rotor faults	Existing methods, in our opinion, are not effective in early identification of aero-engine rotor faults, owing to the difficulty encountered in suppressing the dominant noise signal. We aim to present the promising results of our exploration of an effective method of such early identification. Our method for identifying early faults of aero-engine is based on analysis of aero-engine faults and makes use of Wavelet Analysis and Virtual Instrument.

Then, the recursion formulas of the weighted coefficients were derived using recursive least squares (RLS). Time-frequency analysis for simulation and experimental signals of a faulty bearing inner ring was conducted using the improved and unimproved models. The results showed that the improved model can overcome the unavailability of frequency estimation at the initial time, it has higher accuracy in temporal and frequency estimation, and better anti-noise performance; so the improved model can extract fault feature frequency of rolling bearing more effectively.

84862960887	An improved range-based localization algorithm in wireless sensor network	To further improve the localization accuracy for nodes in wireless sensor network, this paper proposes an improved range-based localization algorithm in wireless sensor network. Firstly, some anchor nodes are optimized and chosen. Then optimized anchor nodes databases are created using those optimized anchor nodes. Secondly, the distance, which between unknown node and anchor node in network, is measured by using anchor nodes from the optimized anchor nodes database. Lastly, the unknown node is located by using Euclidean and trilateration localization algorithm. Some simulation experiments results show that the improved range-based localization algorithm can improve the localization accuracy, and with the positioning process forward, the ratio of anchor nodes is gradually increasing, then localization accuracy is also gradually improved. © 2011 IEEE.

84869988228	Research on load balancing algorithm based on MSTP in dynamic network	Currently implemented Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) cannot meet the requirement of load balancing due to its poor bandwidth utilization and lack of multiple path capability. In this paper we propose a load balancing algorithm based on multiple instances spanning tree protocol (MSTP) in dynamic network after a link load function was defined. In MSTP, VLAN is divided into many group, each group would share a process of spanning tree protocol algorithm to communicate with each other by using different spanning tree topology in different VLAN. In order to realize the load balancing and redundancy backup in dynamic network, we should control the monitored relationship between the VLAN and the MSTP. With this algorithm, traffic between two communication nodes can be spread among multiple paths. The traffic split each path can be dynamic adjusted. In addition, the multiple instances spanning tree with the minimum link load can be chosen for monitoring by using this algorithm to achieve load balancing. And finally, the simulations show that the load balancing algorithm is efficient in dynamic network. © 2012 IEEE.

84870024423	Research on routing algorithm for wireless sensor network based on energy balance	This paper further analyzes the energy consumption model of the LEACH protocol, and proposes a routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks based on energy balance. It uses a more reasonable clustering method; thereby it can further balance energy consumption of the network. In this algorithm the cluster head periodically compute the residual energy of all of members in each work cycle. It takes into full account the residual energy of nodes to determine the route. It chooses an appropriate route under the premise that transmission efficiency and network energy consumption are balanced. Simulation experiments results show that the routing algorithm based on energy balance proposed by this paper can balance the relationship of routing and energy consumption, and can prolong the network lifetime. © 2012 IEEE.

84870617662	Feature selection of sudden failure based on affinity propagation lustering	When diagnosing sudden mechanical failure, in order to make the result of classification more accurate, in this article we describe an affinity propagation clustering algorithm for feature selection of sudden machinery failure diagnosis. General methods of feature selection select features by reducing dimension of the features, at the same time changing the data in the feature space, which would result in incorrect answer to the diagnosis. While affinity propagation method is based on measuring similarity between features whereby redundancy therein is removed, and selecting the exemplar subset of features, while doesn't change the data in the feature space. After testing on clustering and taking the result of PCA and affinity propagation clustering as input of a same SVM classifier, we get the conclusion that the latter has lower error than the former. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84872711366	Fault signal classification using adaptive boosting algorithm	In recent years, researchers seldom investigate how to boost the classification performance of any learning algorithm for fault signal detection. We propose a fault signal classification method based on adaptive boosting (adaboost) in this paper. Adaboost is able to select an optimal linear combination of classifiers to form an ensemble whose joint decision rule has relatively high accuracy on the training set. First, we extract statistical features from sample signals. And then we make use of a decision tree to identify optimal features, which are used to classify the sample set by adaboost algorithm. To verify its accuracy, we set up the roller bearing experiment. Practical results show that the method can precisely identify fault signals, and be comparable to SVM based traditional method. © Kauno technologijos universitetas, 2012.

84874559591	Semi-supervised adaptive parzen Gentleboost algorithm for fault diagnosis	In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised strategy for machine fault diagnosis. In the proposed method, we select parzen window as the generative classifier and Gentleboost as the discriminative classifier. Compared with SVM, boosting method has a very interesting property of relative immunity to overfitting. In addition, we propose a novel adaptive parzen window algorithm. It employs variational adaptive parzen window rather than a global optimized and fixed window, therefore, more accurate density estimates can be obtained. In experiments, artificial and machine vibration data are used to compare with other algorithms. Our proposed algorithm achieves stronger robustness and lower classification error rate. © 2012 ICPR Org Committee.

Experimental results of rotating machinery show that adaboost regression is pronounced comparing with other regression methods for fault condition prognostics.

84883472342	An effective method of identification and monitoring of sudden fault on aero-engine	Sudden fault of aero-engine seriously affects the flight safety of an aircraft. But there is a lack of data samples and it is difficult to extract information on sudden fault. Therefore, we propose what we believe to be an effective method for their identification and monitoring, which combines a support vector machine (SVM) and wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) with intelligent modules. We extract the features of the sudden faults with the WPD and identify the sudden faults with the SVM. Under the conditions of strong background noise and data sample lacking, we use the structural risk minimization principle to establish the function between the aero-engine's fault characteristics and its operation states. Then we use the output of the function to identify the sudden faults and then employ the intelligent modules to monitor and repair the sudden faults. Finally, we did experiments on their identification and monitoring. The experimental results, given in Figs.1 and 3 and Tables 1 and 2, and their analysis show preliminarily that our method can extract quickly the features of sudden faults of an aero-engine and identify them accurately and that it can also monitor and repair the sudden faults, thus effectively enhancing the safety and reliability of the aero-engine particularly at their early stage.
