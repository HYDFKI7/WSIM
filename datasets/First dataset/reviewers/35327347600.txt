17744385523	Behavior of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells on titanium oxide films fabricated by plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition	Our previous research results have shown that Ti-O films with appropriate characteristics possessed good blood compatibility. In this paper, we synthesized Ti-O films using plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIII-D) and investigated the characteristics and the biological behavior of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) onto film surface. The structure and composition of the Ti-O films were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atom force microscopy (AFM). The surface energy was measured by a contact angle method. The in vitro HUVEC-cultured investigation of Ti-O film surface justified that the biological behavior of HUVEC on different structure surfaces was significantly different. The adherence and growth of HUVEC to crystalline Ti-O film surface were much better than that of amorphous Ti-O film. The mechanism based on the relationship between the film characteristics and biological behavior of endothelial cells (ECs) is discussed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

18144369202	Surface characterization and blood compatibility of poly(ethylene terephthalate) modified by plasma surface grafting	Poly(ethlene terephthalate) (PET) used in artificial heart valve sewing rings were treated by argon plasma discharge and grafted by different molecular water-soluble polymer - polyethylene glycols (PEG). The surface properties of the plasma treated and grafted films were determined by contact angle measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The contact angle of water decreased from 83.5° to 38.7° and the interfacial energy diminished from 30.7 to 6.3 mN/m. The ratio of oxygen to carbon increased from 0.15 to 0.25. All the results revealed that PEG chains were successfully grafted onto the surface of the PET films. The interaction between the surface-modified PETs and blood components was investigated to evaluate the blood compatibility of the samples. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of the PET-PEG was significantly longer than that of the untreated PET. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy indicated that adhered, aggregated and morphologically changed platelets were significantly reduced by grafting PEG chains onto the PET films. The in vitro blood compatibility tests suggested that the blood compatibility of PET grafted with PEG was related to the molecular weight of PEG. The best blood compatibility was achieved when the grafted molecular weight of PEG was 6000. The hemocompatibility improvement can be explained by the low interfacial free energy, sterically hindered effects of PEG chains, and maintaining of the normal conformation. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

17644390234	Effect of annealing on structure and biomedical properties of amorphous hydrogenated carbon films	The usual failure of blood-contacting biomedical materials and devices arises from thrombogenesis. When a biomaterial comes in contact with a biological body, interface interaction will be concomitant between the biomaterial surface and biological substance, such as blood protein denaturation resulting from electrical charge transfer of proteins and platelet activation induced by interface thermodynamics. Diamond-like carbon (DLC) has been proposed for use in blood contacting devices. Further understanding of the intrinsic relationship between biomedical properties and structure of amorphous carbon films will promote improvement of their biocompatibility. In this study, hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) films were fabricated at room temperature using plasma immersion ion implantation-deposition (PIII-D). A series of a-C:H films with different structures and chemical bonds were obtained by adjusting the DC bias voltage from -75 to -900 V, then their structure and physical properties were further modified by thermal anneal in vacuum at 600 °C. Raman, elastic recoil detection (ERD) and atomic force microscope (AFM) were used to characterize their structures and chemical bonds. The physical properties and surface characteristics of the films were also examined, including the carrier concentration and mobility, resistivity, and surface wettability. The anticoagulation of the films was evaluated employing in vitro platelet adhesion test. The adhesion, activation, and morphology of the platelets were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The relationship between their structure and blood compatibility was elucidated. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It has been proved that TiN and Ti-O/TiN films both enhance the corrosion resistance of substrate materials. Potentiodynamic polarization curves show that both Ti-6Al-4V substrates deposited with these two kinds of films have lower dissolution currents than that of the uncoated one. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements indicates that TiN films with high corrosion resistance is mainly due to its barrier-type dense film layer, and that Ti-O/TiN film provides high corrosion resistance is mainly owing to its high corrosion potential (E

17644401730	Inhibition of adherent platelet activation produced by Ti-O thin film fabricated by PIII	Thrombogenesis is the principal problem associated with blood-contacting biomedical devices. One of the important reasons is that most of the materials used in these devices cannot avoid inducing platelet adhesion and activation. Our recent investigation suggested that Ti-O thin film could be an alternative antithrombotic material. In this work, we focus our attention on behavior of platelets adhered on Ti-O film. Platelet adhesion experiments were conducted to examine the platelets/material interaction in vitro and the effect of protein adsorption on platelet adhesion and activation. The specific resultants of platelet release (GMP140) were tested for evaluating the platelet activation. In vivo implantation was used to investigate formation of thrombus. The excellent anticoagulation performance of Ti-O films has been shown in in vivo long-term implantation. The release of specific resultants GMP140 from platelets contacting to Ti-O film was the lower than LTI-carbon. The morphology of adherent platelets maintains round and isolated. Apparently, the activation of platelets adhered on Ti-O film was suppressed. The results of in vitro test also suggest that the suppression of platelet activation is related to plasma protein adsorption. Preadsorbing fibrinogen doesn't cause the exacerbation of platelet activation. It seems reasonable to suggest that its excellent anticoagulation is caused by inhibition of adherent platelet activation produced by Ti-O film. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

17644412341	Surface modification of biomaterials by plasma immersion ion implantation	The present paper presents the results of surface modifications of biomaterials using plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) in Institute of Surface Modification of Biomaterials in Southwest Jiaotong University. In the research, titanium oxide films and diamond-like carbon (DLC) films doped with different elements, as well as surface modification of polymers, are prepared using PIII. The blood compatibility of the films is investigated. Significant improvement in blood compatibility of the films compared with those untreated substrate materials is confirmed. The mechanisms of the blood compatibility of the films are discussed. The results show that the energy band structure of the material surface may be a controlling factor in the blood compatibility of the material. A film with an n-type semiconductor nature would have a better blood compatibility.

19944396174	Ti-O/TiN films synthesized by plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition on 316L: Study of deformation behavior and mechanical properties	Ti-O/TiN gradient films have been synthesized on 316L stainless steel using plasma immersion ion implantation & deposition (PIII&D). The coated samples were subjected to tensile testing and observed in situ by scanning electron microscopy. No delamination, peeling or cracking was found on the film after plastic deformation of 0.16 mm residual displacement. Nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests revealed that the prepared films possess high nanohardness and good adhesion strength to the metal substrate. The mechanical properties of the synthesized Ti-O/TiN films are thought to be attributed to the good nanostructure, high density, smooth surface, slow transition from Ti-O to TiN and broad film/matrix interface achieved by the PIII-D process. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

23444445210	Surface modification of polymeric materials by plasma immersion ion implantation	Polymer surfaces typically have low surface tension and high chemical inertness and so they usually have poor wetting and adhesion properties. The surface properties can be altered by modifying the molecular structure using plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). In this work, Nylon-6 was treated using oxygen/nitrogen PIII. The observed improvement in the wettability is due to the oxygenated and nitrogen (amine) functional groups created on the polymer surface by the plasma treatment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show that nitrogen and oxygen plasma implantation result in C-C bond breaking to form the imine and amine groups as well as alcohol and/or carbonyl groups on the surface. The water contact angle results reveal that the surface wetting properties depend on the functional groups, which can be adjusted by the ratio of oxygen-nitrogen mixtures. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, titanium oxide film was modified by phosphorus ion implantation and succeeding vacuum annealing. RBS were used to investigate phosphorus distribution profile. Contact angle test results show that phosphorus-doped titanium oxide film becomes more hydrophilic after higher temperature annealing, while its electric conductivity increases. Antithrombotic property of phosphorus-doped titanium oxide thin films was examined by clotting time and platelet adhesion tests. The results suggest that phosphorus doping is an effective way to improve the bloodcompatibility of titanium oxide film, and it is related to the changes of electron structure and surface properties caused by phosphorus doping. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The deformation behavior of the Ti-O/Ti-N coated stainless steel stents was investigated. In vivo investigation of the anticoagulation behavior of Ti-O coated coronary stents was also performed. The results of mechanical characterization of the Ti-O/Ti-N coated stents show that the film has strong binding strength, and to some extent the ability to withstand plastic deformation. The biological response behavior of the coated stent surface was significantly different from the uncoated. The results of implantation of stents into rabbit ventral aorta show no thrombus formation on the surfaces of the Ti-O coated stents, although serious coagulation had occurred on the surfaces of unmodified stents over a period of 4 weeks under conditions with no anticoagulant. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Wells containing organized arrays of square holes were produced by plasma etching for 40 min on the surface of the a-C:H films covered by a steel stainless mask. The characteristics of the micro-patterned surfaces including the chemical composition, structure, surface morphology, contact angle, and surface energy were investigated and the effects of surface micro-patterning on the behavior of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells were investigated. All the micro-patterned samples exhibit a more hydrophobic nature and both cell adhesion and proliferation on the micro-patterned samples are improved compared to the un-patterned hydrogenated carbon film. The micro-patterns on the hydrogenated carbon films are observed to influence the water contact angle, surface energy, and HUVE cell behaviors, and the surface energy and hydrophobic surfaces appear to be the predominant reasons for the better cell adhesion and more rapid proliferation.

Material surface characteristics can be suggested as the important factors that influence the response of blood to materials. Thus, modifying the surface characteristics of a material becomes an important way to endue it with the antithrombotic function of preventing blood cell/plasma protein activation. This article is going to summarize results from previous studies on functional inorganic films coated with blood contacting biomaterials, including fabricating condition, characteristics and antithrombotic function. The functional inorganic films of Ti-O, a-C:N:H and Si-N synthesized using PIII-D on the surface of a biomaterial can endue it with the antithrombotic function of preventing platelet adhesion/activation. The characteristics of the films changed with alteration of the fabrication condition and influenced their antithrombotic function strongly. The in vitro test results showed that improved biomaterial surfaces with special antithrombotic function can be obtained from the optimization of the fabrication condition according to the understanding of the blood-materials interaction. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

34249694793	Immobilization of albumin and heparin on the surface of Ti-O films for improving blood compatibility	Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTE) was covalently interacted with hydroxyl on the surface of Ti-O films prepared by magnetron sputtering, and albumin and heparin were immobilized on the APTE-coated surface with addition of 1-ethyl-3- (3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) as cross-link agent. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the modified surface. Contact angle results indicate that there was an increase in the contact angle to the surface of APTE-coated Ti-O films, and a decrease in the contact angle to the surface of albumin-and heparin-immobilized surfaces. Blood platelet adhesion in vitro was improved significantly after immobilization of albumin and heparin on Ti-O films. Endothelial cell (EC) culture tests showed that EC could grow on the surface of Ti-O films immobilized with albumin and heparin, but the growth and proliferation behavior of endothelial cells was not as good as on naked Ti-O films. This investigation showed that the surface of bio-inert inorganic materials immobilized with biological molecules is feasible and effective for improving the blood compatibility.

34447523757	Improving thromboresistance of Ti-O films by phosphorus-doping: Fabricating conditions, characteristics and antithrombotic behavior	Surface modification has become an important way to develop new antithrombotic biomaterials. In the past ten years Ti-O films have been engaging much research attention because of their excellent antithrombotic properties. In order to understand the thromboresistance mechanisms involved, we focus our attention in this work on the influence of phosphorus doping on the structure, properties and thromboresistance behavior of these films. The results show that the electrical resistance of the film decreases with increasing annealing temperature, and that phosphorus is redistributed within the film after annealing. The films exhibit different wettability after annealing at various temperatures. P-doped Ti-O thin films show significant improvement of thromboresistance after annealing at higher temperatures. It is suggested that the thromboresistance of Ti-O thin films is related to their semiconductor nature. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

34447526679	Effect of hydrogen on the behavior of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) on titanium oxide films fabricated by plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition	In this paper, titanium oxide (Ti-O) thin films were fabricated by plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIII-D), and subsequently hydrogen ions were implanted into the film surface by PIII to improve the biocompatibility of blood and vascular contacting biomaterials and prosthesis such as stents, etc. The films were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The contact angle of Ti-O films with simulated body fluid was measured. The biological behavior of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) on Ti-O film surfaces was evaluated by an in vitro cultured HUVEC experiment. The in vitro investigation of cultured ECs on Ti-O films revealed that the biological behavior of HUVECs, such as adherence, growth and proliferation etc., were better biologically for hydrogen-containing Ti-O films than for untreated Ti-O films. The results of our study support the hypothesis that the surface morphology and biological properties such as wettability and surface tension etc. of the implanted Ti-O films are changed to a more desirable range by the high energy H plasma immersion ion implantation and by H incorporation in the films. As a result, the H-containing Ti-O films possess good biocompatibility. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0033688168	Simulation of temperature distribution on a spherical target during plasma immersion ion implantation	Ion implantation has been shown to be an effective surface modification technique without the sacrificing the bulk properties. The modification results are, however, influenced not only by the implantation voltage, incident dose, but also the treatment temperature, particularly in elevated temperature ion implantation into metals with lower temper temperature. During the treatment, both the sample temperature and its history contribute to the final surface properties. In this paper, we investigate the temperature distribution on a spherical target during plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) using numerical simulation. The majority of the heat input into the target is shown to originate from the energetic ions accelerated by plasma sheath. Our simulation results also demonstrate that the implantation voltage, pulsing frequency, pulse duration and plasma density exert different influence on the temperature rising rate in addition to the equilibrium temperature. The influence of the target size is also simulated, since it critically affects the heating and cooling characteristics of the process. Our model is important to the understanding of the local temperature variation and heating rate of both planar and non-planar samples during plasma immersion ion implantation.

The result of toluidine blue-O (TBO) method showed that the -COOH concentration on the surface of the PPAA films decreased from 20.73 nM to17.90 nM after vacuum thermal treatment. Fibronectin (Fn) was successfully covalently immobilized onto the modified surface PPAA via a covalent bond reacted with carboxyl groups. Diffuse reflectance Fourier infrared transform spectroscopy (DRFTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were utilized to characterize the layer-by-layer PPAA surface modification. From the evaluation of immunostaining for actin and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), the surface of Fn-immobilized thermal treated PPAA films could be used to enhance the adhesion and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Especially, the exposure of RGD domain existing in the immobilized Fn was ascertained by ELISA, which was one of main improvement factors of HUVEC's adhesion and proliferation.

In this paper, four targets closed-filed unbalance magnetron sputtering was introduced, the effect of the different magnetic field arrangement on the titanium oxide films properties was investigated. By changing the distance from target to vacuum center, the different unbalance state of the magnetic field was formed around the substrate. The titanium oxide films were synthesized at different unbalance state of the magnetic field. The microstructure of the titanium oxide films was studied by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and the residual stress measurement for the films was determined by grazing incidence XRD. The results revealed that the higher unbalance of the magnetic field around the substrate, the higher ion current of the substrate. Comparing with increasing the substrate bias voltage, the ion current increased 2-4 times through changing magnetic field arrangement to induce higher unbalance of the magnetic field. Ion/atom ratio increase was in favor of rutile phase formation for titanium oxide film. The unbalance state increase resulted in more higher compressive stress in the films.

The effect of different deposition parameters: nitrogen partial pressure, substrate-bias voltage and preheating of the substrate, on the structural and mechanical properties of the coating was investigated. X-ray diffraction analysis was used to determine the structure and composition of the coatings. The tribological behaviour and wear properties of the coatings against Si3N4 ball at different normal loads were studied under reciprocating sliding condition. The results showed that a smooth and dense CrN coating with good properties can be obtained provided a pure Cr interlayer was pre-deposited. The optimal deposition parameters were the nitrogen partial pressure of 0.1 Pa, substrate-bias voltage of-100 V. Preheating of the substrate was no good for improving the properties of the coating. The FCVA CrN coating showed high hardness and good wear resistance, which was probably attributed to its smooth surface and dense microstructure. The wear mechanism of the CrN coating was a combination of abrasion and oxidation. However, the coating flaked off at high normal load due to the deficient adhesion strength of the coating to the substrate.

In this study, titanium oxide coatings were used as the basis for covalent immobilization of a BSA layer by a photochemical method. BSA was first modified with azidophenyl group on the side chain, so it (AZ-BSA) has the property of photo-reactivity. Simultaneously, an organic monolayer of 3-aminopropylphosphonic acid (APP) was introduced on the Ti-O film by self-assembling, and then UV irradiation was used to couple AZ-BSA with APP. FTIR, XPS and contact angle measurements confirmed the occurrence of the modification. Additionally, a surface with both BSA immobilized and non-BSA immobilized regions was prepared by using a mask when irradiating, thus the interactions of materials and platelets were visualized. Platelet experiments of both qualitative and quantitative analysis showed that BSA immobilized surface was effective to inhibit platelet adhesion in vitro.

66249104012	Anticoagulant surface modification of titanium via layer-by-layer assembly of collagen and sulfated chitosan multilayers	Extracellular matrix (ECM)-like biomimetic surface modification of cardiovascular implants is a promising method for improving hemocompatibility. In the present work, collagen (Col) and sulfated chitosan (SCS) multilayers were coated on pure titanium using a layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly technique. The Col-SCS multilayer growth was carried out by first depositing a single layer of positively charged poly-L-lysine (PLL) on the NaOH-treated titanium substrate (negatively charged surface), followed by alternate deposition of negatively charged SCS and positively charged Col, and terminated by an outermost layer of SCS. Platelet adhesion in vitro, partial activated thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) assays were used to evaluate the hemocompatibility of the Col-SCS multilayer coated titanium. The multilayer processed surfaces displayed reduced platelet adhesion and activation, and prolonged clotting time of APTT and PT compared with untreated titanium. Thus, the approach described here may provide a basis for the preparation of modified titanium surfaces for application in cardiovascular implants. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this paper, DLC films were deposited on the 316L stainless steel substrates by filtered cathodic vacuum arc (FCVA) deposition. The effect of deposition process, such as bias voltage, films thickness and titanium transition layer, on interfacial adhesion was studied. The results indicate that the adhesion of the DLC film fabricated at pulse bias voltage (-1000V) is better than which deposited at DC bias voltage (-80V). The adhesion force decreases with the increasing of the thickness of the films. And the titanium transition layer (100 nm) is of advantage to the adhesion. The DLC films on the 316L stainless steel substrate which stretched by 20% were still integrate and had a stronger corrosion resistance than the virgin stainless steel. The results showed that the DLC films prepared by FCVA adhere firmly with 316L stainless steel and improve the corrosion resistance of 316L substrate.

70349772931	Deposition of a-C:H films on UHMWPE substrate and its wear-resistance	In prosthetic hip replacements, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) wear debris is identified as the main factor limiting the lifetime of the artificial joints. Especially UHMWPE debris from the joint can induce tissue reactions and bone resorption that may lead to the joint loosening. The diamond like carbon (DLC) film has attracted a great deal of interest in recent years mainly because of its excellent tribological property, biocompatibility and chemically inert property. In order to improve the wear-resistance of UHMWPE, a-C:H films were deposited on UHMWPE substrate by electron cyclotron resonance microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (ECR-PECVD) technology. During deposition, the working gases were argon and acetylene, the microwave power was set to 800 W, the biased pulsed voltage was set to -200 V (frequency 15 kHz, duty ratio 20%), the pressure in vacuum chamber was set to 0.5 Pa, and the process time was 60 min.

0034745961	Hybrid elevated-temperature, low/high-voltage plasma immersion ion implantation of AISI304 stainless steel	Elevated-temperature plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) is an effective non-line-of-sight technique to harden austenitic stainless steel by producing expanded austenitic phases in the near surface region. We report here a hybrid elevated-temperature, low/high voltage approach, which improves the efficiency while retaining the non-line-of-sight advantages of PIII. A low-voltage (4 kV), elevated-temperature (355 °C) PIII process is first used to produce the modified layer, but the nitrogen concentration in this layer is typically relatively low and the thickness may not be adequate. This is followed by high-voltage (25 kV) PIII at a lower temperature to increase the nitrogen concentration and to achieve the desirable surface enhancement effects. To assess the efficacy of the technique, the samples are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), nanohardness measurements, and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth profiling. The experimental results show that the nitrogen concentration increases by nearly 75% and the nitrogen penetration depth nearly doubles that of the low-voltage sample. The surface microhardness also improves by 150% and our data suggest that it is due to the formation of expanded austenites.

In the present study, PPAa films on 316L medical stainless steel are prepared by pulsed radio frequency (RF) plasma polymerization using allylamine as a precursor under different duty cycles. The effect of the pulsed duty cycles on the composition, structure, surface morphology, wettability and mechanical properties of PPAa films are investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, laser Raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS), atom force microscope (AFM), contact angle measurement, nanoscratch test and substrate straining method. All results of FTIR, XPS and Raman indicate that there are more amine groups from allylamine monomer on the 20/80 film fabricated by 20% duty cycle. The wettability of the 20/80 film is higher than that of 20/30 film prepared using 40% duty cycle. AFM micrographs demonstrate no remarkable differences in the morphological characteristics, but grain size of 20/30 film is larger than that of 20/80 film. The critical force of 20/80 film is about 71.86. mN, higher than that of 20/30 film and has a better scratch resistance.

Bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on the surface of a material have been considered as one of the main factors of stent re-occlusion in clinic. This work reported preventing bacterial adherence and bacterial biofilm formation on the surface of biliary stent material using chitosan film. The chitosan film was deposited on 316 L stainless steel (SS) plate by electrophoresis method and was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The ability of inhibiting bacterial adherence was investigated by incubating in human fresh bile adding E. coli and Enterobacter at 37±1 °C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence staining were used for observing bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. The results show that chitosan film was uniformly deposited on material surface, and the composition of the film did not change through cross-linking, but the crystallinity of chitosan film become well. Comparing to un-modified sample, the E. coli and Enterococcus adhesion amount and colonization on the surface of modified sample were significantly decreased by fluorescence staining and SEM. It is suggested that chitosan could be applied to biliary stent in clinical because of its antimicrobial activities. © 2010 Wuhan University of Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Ti-O films of various thicknesses were grown on the surface of 316L stainless steel (SS) stents by metal vacuum arc source deposition technology, and the phase composition, the thickness and the adhesion between films and substance were investigated by micro-x-ray diffraction (Micro-XRD), surface profilometer, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) separately. The corrosion resistance of modified stent was assessed by polarization test in phosphate buffered solution (37 ± 1 °C). The result shows that the Ti-O films were very smooth and uniform. There were not any cracks and delaminations after dilation by angioplasty, the adhesion between Ti-O film and stent is satisfactory. The open circuit potential (OCP) of the Ti-O film modified stents was higher than that of the bare stents; it shows that the electrochemical stability of modified stents was more than bare stents. The polarization test result indicates that the passivation stability and anti-breakdown performance of Ti-O film stents had better than bare stents, and no pitting was observed on the surface of both modified stents, but the local film striations were found on the stent surface of the thicker film, which indicated that the Ti-O film stents with certain thickness has good corrosion resistance. © 2011 ASM International.

Firstly titanium metal interlayer about 30nm was deposited on UHMWPE substrate by filtered cathodic vacuum arc (FCVA) technology to make UHMWPE metallization, then DLC film was deposited. The results indicated that the UHMWPE metallization can reduce UHMWPE surface charge accumulation during the DLC films deposition. As a result, the deposition rate, sp3 content, hardness and wear resistance of DLC films were increased.

0035509051	Biomedical properties of tantalum nitride films synthesized by reactive magnetron sputtering	The biomedical properties of tantalum nitride thin films synthesized by reactive magnetron sputtering employing orthogonal design technology are investigated. The adhesion properties between the film and substrate can be enhanced by optimizing the sputtering gas pressure and substrate temperature. The hardness of the tantalum nitride films is greatly affected by the nitrogen partial pressure, and our results show that films deposited under the optimal conditions can achieve a hardness value of approximately 40 GPa. The blood compatibility of the tantalum nitride films, as evaluated by clotting time measurement and platelet adhesion tests, is compared to that of TiN, Ta and low-temperature isotropic pyrolytic carbon (LTIC). Our data reveal that the blood compatibility of our tantalum nitride films is better, and tantalum nitride is thus an excellent material for the fabrication of commercial artificial heart valves. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The purpose of Ti-O is to improve the blood compatibility, and that of Ti-N is to improve the mechanical properties. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), microhardness tests, pin-on-disk wear experiments, and platelet adhesion investigation were conducted to evaluate the properties and blood compatibility of the coatings. The results reveal that the blood compatibility of the Ti-O/Ti-N duplex coatings is better than that of low temperature isotropic pyrolytic carbon (LTIC). The microhardness of Ti-O/Ti-N duplex coatings can reach 14 GPa. The wear resistance is also much better than that of Ti6A14V alloy. The semiconductor nature of non-stoichiometric titanium oxide may be responsible for the observed improvement in the blood compatibility. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Surface modification has shown potential to improve the anti-coagulation of blood-contacting biomedical devices and materials [1-3]. Our in vitro study of Ti-O thin films has recently shown that Ti-O thin films possess superior blood compatibility to low temperature isotropic pyrolytic carbon (LTI-carbon) [1]. In this work, we have focussed our attention onto the in vivo evaluation of Ti-O thin films fabricated by plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). The samples of titanium coated by Ti-O thin films were implanted in dogs' hearts for 1 month. The results of the implantation showed that no thrombus was found on the surfaces of the Ti-O thin film, although the coagulation occurred on the surfaces of LTI-carbon. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this work, investigation on plastic deformation of TiN films synthesized by PIIID was performed by pulling the TiN film-coated stainless steel sheet samples. The surface morphology during the pulling was observed in situ by scanning electron microscopy. No delaminating, peeling or cracking were found on the coating surfaces. The structure of the films was identified by transmission electron microscopy and atom force microscopy. It is considered that the excellent deformation behavior of the TiN film was related with the nanocrystal structure of the films and the broader film/matrix interface achieved by the PIII process. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In order to enhance the interface bonding strength between the film and Al alloy substrate, a 50nm silicon film was firstly fabricated on aluminium alloy substrate by unbalanced magnetron sputtering. The fiction and wear properties of the a-C:H films were evaluated using a ball-on-disk tribometer in air at room temperature. The results showed that the tribological properties of the a-C:H films decreased with the substrate bias voltage increased from -150 to -1000V.

The corrosion resistance of the Ti-O film modified and bare L-605 stents was investigated by cyclic potentiodynamic polarization tests in phosphate buffered solution (PBS, 37 ± 1. °C). The optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the modified stents indicated that the surface of all stent cells was very smooth and uniform, and the thickness of Ti-O film was about 10 nm. There were not any cracks and delamination on stent surface after dilation by angioplasty. The polarization results showed that the natural corrosion potential of the Ti-O film modified and bare stents was similar. But the corrosion current density of Ti-O film modified stent was lower than that of the bare stent at all scanned potential range. Compared with Ti-O film modified stent, the bare stent was more susceptible to corrosion. After cyclic potentiodynamic polarization test, the slight localized corrosion was found on the surface of bare stents. But no film flakes or localized pitting can be observed on Ti-O film modified stent. All these results showed that Ti-O film modified stent had the better corrosion resistance, compared with the bare L605 stent. © 2011.

80055122470	High frequency and low voltage plasma immersion ion implantation of nitrogen on industrial pure iron at different Rf power	Traditional plasma ion immersion implantation (PIII) can effectively improve material mechanical property and corrosion resistance. But the modified layer by PIII is too thin for many industrial applications. High frequency and low voltage plasma immersion ion implantation (HLPIII) has advantages of PIII and nitriding. Comparing with traditional ion nitriding, HLPIII can obtain higher implantation energy and create a thick modified surface layer.

81255137073	The effect of a TiN interlayer on the tribological properties of diamond-like carbon films deposited on 7A04 aluminum alloy	Aluminum-based alloys are known to be significant candidates in the automotive and aerospace industries. However, the relatively poor wear resistance of aluminum alloys restricts their further application. In this paper, diamond-like carbon (DLC) films are deposited on the 7A04 aluminum alloy to improve its wear resistance by electron cyclotron resonance plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Before the DLC film deposition, TiN films were first fabricated as interlayer between the 7A04 aluminum alloy and DLC films by unbalanced magnetron sputtering. The influence of the TiN buffer layer on the mechanical properties of the DLC film is studied. The results showed that the TiN interlayer could provide enough mechanical support for the DLC films by suppressing plastic deformation of the aluminum alloy and then could effectively improve wear resistance of DLC films on 7A04 aluminum alloy. © 2006 IEEE.

The N-(2-phthaloylation) chitosan was obtained via the reaction of chitosan with phthalic anhydride in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 130°C, and O-(3,6-hydroxyethyl) chitosan was produced using chlorohydrins as grafting agent and hydrazine hydrate as reductant. The structure of hydroxyethyl chitosan (HC) was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) respectively. The solubility, anticoagulation, and antibacterial property were assessed separately. The result shows that amine I of chitosan is replaced and the amide II disappears during chemical modification, and the functional groups of C6-OH and-NH2 are also reacted. The water-solubility of the novel chitosan derivative was enhanced relatively; it could even slightly soluble in methanol. The results of platelet adhesion and the activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) indicate that grafting hydroxyethyl could improve anticoagulation of chitosan. The antibacterial activity of HC against Enterococcus and E. coli had been much better owing to enhancing the degree of protonation. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The screen-grid was used to provide an electric field to accelerate the oxygen ions towards the UHMWPE substrate during the plasma treatment process. The effects of the screen-grid voltage on the surface microstructure, wettability, mechanical properties and wear resistance of UHMWPE were investigated. It was found that the degree of crosslinking, oxidation, wettability and surface roughness of UHMWPE can be increased with the increasing of the screen-grid voltage. Owing to the increase of the degree of crosslinking, the hardened layer formed on the surface of the UHMWPE samples was also strengthened greatly with the increase of the grid voltage. However, the wear results indicated that the UHMWPE sample modified at higher bias voltage exhibits poor wear performance, which could be mainly related to the embrittlement resulted from the aggravation of oxidation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the influence of this coating on the wear mechanism has not been elucidated yet. In this paper, ball-on-disc wear tests against 6-mmdiameter Ti6Al4V balls had been performed to characterize the wear performance of a polycrystalline diamond (PCD) coating produced by hot filament chemical vapor deposition and of bare tungsten carbide (WC-Co). The wear scars were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum. The PCD coating exhibited lower friction coefficient and mass loss than those of the WC-Co under same testing condition. The oxidation was inevitable in both PCD and WC-Co wear process. For WC-Co, abrasive wear was the main wear mechanism. In contrast to that, the PCD coating was worn by microcuts in the ball-on-disc test, and oxidized Ti64 debris also caused a great effect on its wear mechanism. © 2012 IEEE.

Diamond-like carbon (DLC), one form of amorphous carbon that is widely used in many kinds of industries, has been proposed for use in blood contacting medical devices. However, the blood coagulation mechanism on DLC in a biological environment is not well understood. Platelet adhesion and activation are crucial events in the interactions between blood and the materials as they influence the subsequent formation of thrombus. In this work, the behavior of platelets adhered onto hydrogenated amorphous carbon films (a-C:H) is investigated. Hydrogenated amorphous carbon films with different hydrogen contents, structures, and chemical bonds were fabricated at room temperature using plasma immersion ion implantation-deposition (PIII-D). The wettability of the films was investigated by contact angle measurements using several common liquids. Platelet adhesion experiments were conducted to examine the interaction of blood with the films in vitro and the activation of adherent platelets. The results show that the behavior of the platelets adhered on the a-C:H films is influenced by their structure and chemical bond, and it appears that protein interaction plays a key role in the activation of the adherent platelets. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In order to reduce the metal debris quantity and the release of metal ions, a diamond like carbon (DLC) film is deposited on CoCrMo alloy by using a filtered cathodic vacuum arc technique (FCVA). The tribocorrosion behavior of DLC coated CoCrMo alloy is studied in bovine calf serum and 0.9% NaCl solution by using a linear reciprocating pin-on-plate tribometer with an integrated electrochemical cell. The open circuit potential (OCP) and the polarization test are monitored during the reciprocating pin-on-plate test. The results show that the absorbed protein layer on DLC surface play a positive role in reducing wear and metal ion release. The presence of DLC layer improves the tribocorrosion resistance of CoCrMo alloy.

84882293336	Microstructure and platelet adhesion behavior of titanium oxide films synthesized by reactive high-power pulse magnetron sputtering	Titanium oxide films are promising as a blood-contacting biomedical material. In this paper, titanium oxide films are deposited on a Si (1 0 0) substrate by high-power pulsed magnetron sputtering (HPPMS) at different oxygen flow rates. The microstructure and surface morphology are investigated for a variety of oxygen flow rates mixed with argon gas. The blood compatibility of the films is evaluated using a platelet adhesion experiment, and the quantity and morphology of the adhered platelets are investigated through optical microscopy. The oxygen flow rate is varied from 2 to 10 sccm with a fixed argon flow rate of 60 sccm. The composition of the deposited films was TiO and Ti-2 O mixtures at an oxygen flow rate of 2 sccm. An anatase and rutile mixed phase is found at an oxygen flow rate of 4 sccm. The titanium oxide film is in the rutile phase with an increasing oxygen flow rate up to 6 sccm or higher. This suggests that the rutile-structured titanium oxide films could be synthesized by HPPMS without heating the substrate. The titanium oxide films with a rutile structure had a very smooth surface with a minimum surface roughness of 0.3 nm. The result of a platelet adhesion experiment indicates that the rutile phase titanium oxide film showed better blood compatibility. From this point of view, the films synthesized by HPPMS are promising to be as biomaterials showing excellent corrosion resistance and a smoothed surface. © 2012 IEEE.

However, some methods for evaluating the tribological performance of the films have some drawbacks on accuracy and sensitivity in the industry application. In this paper, a tribological test is carried out by the ball-on-disk tribometer, combining the three-electrode electrochemical measure system in a 0.9% NaCl solution, and the open circuit potential (OCP) measurement is used to monitor the wear process of the titanium nitride (TiN) and diamond-like carbon (DLC) films. For a single TiN film modified Ti alloy sample, the OCP decreases instantaneously when the TiN film is broken and the substrate is tinily exposed to the solution. However, for the DLC multilayer film, the obvious gradual decrease of the OCP corresponds with the layer-by-layer wear-out failure process of the film. These results show that the OCP of the films is sensitive to the interface condition of the films and the counterpart in the solution. The OCP behaviors of the films can represent the wear and failure process. In other words, the OCP measurement is a reliable and real-time method, which can monitor the wear and failure process of the films. © 1973-2012 IEEE.

An intelligent control system was developed to control the advance of the metal cathode source and to vary the gas composition by programmable logic control (PLC). Three different processes were used to fabricate gradient films. The mechanical properties of films synthesized on silicon wafers, titanium and low temperature isotropic carbon (LTIC) were investigated by nanoindentation tests, pin-on-disc wear experiments, and scratch testing. Analysis by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) showed that the surface Ti-O layer of the films was a rutile structure. The gradient characteristics of the films were supported by qualitative analysis of secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). The thickness of films was about 5500-9000 Å. Platelet adhesion experiments were used to determine blood compatibility of the films. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to observe the wear and scratch traces. The results show that the films have good wear resistance and high adhesion strength. The adhesion force was up to about 66 N on metal substrate. Platelet adhesion was also observed by SEM and it shown that the adsorption and deformation of platelets on the synthesized Ti-O/Ti-N gradient films were significantly suppressed compared to platelets on LTIC.

The result showed that the chains of PEG were successfully grafted on the surface of PET and the water wettability of PET surface was improved. The competitive adsorption relation of plasma protein (fibrinogen and albumin) on materials surface was analyzed with respect to surface energy and interface free energy. The results reveal that PET films grafted with PEG long chain possess the characteristic of preferential adsorbing albumin and this adsorption tendency on the grafted PEG6000 sample is most distinct. The platelet adhesion test on PET films whose surfaces have been pre-exposed with fibrinogen and albumin indicates that the surface of adsorbed albumin effectively inhibits platelet adhesion and aggregation, and possesses favorable blood compatibility, but on the other hand, the adsorbed fibrinogen surface enhances platelet adhesion and aggregation.

0141961910	Plasma Surface Modification of Biomaterials Applied for Cardiovascular Devices	Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death among human diseases. To save the patient's life, a series of artificial devices have been developed in recent decades. Although good progress has been made, some critical problems still exist, such as poor anticoagulation properties leading to a higher rate of complications. Improving the blood compatibility is a very important goal in biomedical materials research. Among the surface modification techniques for improving blood compatibility of biomaterials, plasma processes have attracted attention because of their high effectiveness and low cost. In this paper we describe some applications of plasma processes developed in our laboratory such as plasma grafting, films synthesis, and plasma based ion implantation, to modify biomaterials and cardiovascular devices. Titanium oxide films were synthesized by different processes such as DC metal plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition and by magnetron sputtering. Diamond-like carbon films were fabricated by pulsed metal arc plasma and by hydrocarbon gas plasma immersion ion implantation. Acetylene ion implantation into polyurethane and plasma grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with different molecular weight on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films was also performed. Heparin and albumin grafting was carried out on polymers by means of plasma pretreatment. Significant improvement was found in the blood compatibility of cardiovascular devices and components such as artificial heart valves' sew, cage and leaflets, and vascular stents. We also discuss further development of the research.

0141962307	Enhanced Corrosion Resistance of Ti6A14V with Ti-O Film Deposited by DC Metal Vacuum Arc Deposition	Ti-6A1-4V is widely used for fabricating biomedical implants because of their excellent mechanical performance, comparatively high corrosion resistance and good biocompatibility. However, there is increasing evidence that titanium metal ions may be released in vivo, and under certain conditions, extensively accumulated in adjacent tissue. Therefore, various modern modification methods are expected to enhance the corrosion resistance as well as the biocompatibility of these alloys. Among them, DC Metal Arc Deposition provides an attractive method owing to its high efficiency, easy control of composition and structure of the films, highly adhesion force between film and its substrate. TiO films with different composition and structure as determined by XPS and XRD, were fabricated using DC Metal Vacuum Arc Deposition on a substrate of Ti-6A1-4V alloy. Various deposited TiO films with different O/Ti ratios were investigated by electrochemical tests in Hanks solution, which is commonly used for biomaterial evaluation. The open-circuit potential versus exposure time (I-t), polarization curves (E-I) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of Ti-O film deposited samples in Hanks, were obtained with uncoated Ti6A14V and heat oxidized TiO

CN films are expected to be used as protective, tribological, and optical coatings. In the last 10 years, various deposition techniques have been used for the preparation of amorphous carbon nitride thin film, e.g. reactive sputtering, ion-assisted dynamic mixing, shielded arc ion plating (SAIP) and electron cyclotron resonance-assisted microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (ECR-MPCVD) etc. In this paper, nitrogen incorporated carbon films were prepared by plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIII-D) at room temperature, where carbon ions was generated by metal vapor vacuum arc (MEVVA) source and reacted with N

0141962618	In Vivo Blood Compatibility of Titanium Oxide Film Coated Artificial Heart Valves Prepared by Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation and Deposition	Successful application of cardiovascular devices such as artificial heart valves (AHV) has saved millions of patients' lives. However complications caused by thrombogenicity or bleeding still exist due to insufficient blood compatibility of the clinically applied AHV materials. Surface modification has shown good potential to improve the anticoagulation of blood-contacting biomedical devices and materials. Our previous studies of Ti-O thin films synthesized using ion beam enhanced deposition (IBED) have shown that Ti-O films possess superior blood compatibility to the conventional clinically-applied AHV materials. In the work described here we focused our attention on the in vivo blood compatibility behavior of Ti-O thin film coated artificial heart valves prepared by plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIIID). Artificial heart valves coated by Ti-O thin film were implanted into dogs' hearts for different periods from one month to three months under conditions of no anticoagulant. The results of the implantations showed very low thrombus formation on the surfaces of the Ti-O thin film coated AHVs, although serious coagulation had occurred on the surfaces of unmodified AHV.

0141996962	Ti-N-O Nano-Films Deposited by Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation and Deposition: Deformation Behavior and Mechanical Properties	316L stainless steel is widely used for fabricating biomedical implants owing to its good corrosion resistance as well as its biocompatibility. To-date many techniques (including PVD, CVD, IBAD, and more), have been used for the surface modification of metallic biomedical implants. However the film/matrix binding strength and the toughness of the films are not adequate to meet the needs of some applications. Ion Beam Assisted Deposition (IBAD) has shown better performance than PVD and CVD due to a broader film/matrix interface and modulated structure of the films. However IBAD can only treat samples of simple shape, having line-of-sight limitation. Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation and Deposition (PIII&D) has shown great potential for industrial applications owing to the absence of line-of-sight limitations. Our previous research has shown that Ti-O films can improve the blood compatibility of implants substantially. It is well know that TiN films have excellent mechanical properties. Hence, to achieve higher durability as well as excellent blood compatibility, nanostructured Ti-N-O gradient films have been synthesized on stainless steel using PIII&D. Tension tests were performed on Ti-N-O film coated 316L sheet in situ using SEM to observe the plastic deformation of the film. No delaminating, peeling or cracking were found on the film after relatively high plastic deformation. The binding strength between the film and matrix was measured by a scratch test method, and the hardness and modulus by nano-indentation tests. High binding strength, hardness and Young's modulus were confirmed. TEM, AFM and AES were used to identify the structure, surface morphology, and depth composition profile, respectively. Rutile Ti-O and cubic TiN crystals with the grain size about 40 nm were observed. We hypothesize that the excellent mechanical properties of the synthesized Ti-N-O film are attributable to the nano-crystalline structure of the films, their high density, and excellent surface quality as well as a broader film/matrix interface achieved by the PIII-D process.

0345547624	Mechanical properties of TiN nano-film deposited by plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition	Nano-structured TiN films were synthesized on stainless steel by using plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIII-D). Samples deposited with TiN film were undertaken a tension test and observed in situ by scanning electron microscope. It shows that there is no delamination, peeling or cracking existing on the film after relative highly plastic deformation. Scratch test was chosen to measure the adhesion strength between the film and matrix, and a very high value was obtained. Nano-indentation tests for the synthesized TiN film shows that it possesses very high nano-hardness and Young's modulus. Transmission electron microscopy was used to identify the structure of the prepared film, atom force microscopy to observe the surface morphology, and Auger electron spectroscope to detect the composition profile in depth. It is considered that the excellent mechanical properties of the synthesized TiN film are attributed to the nanocrystal structure of the film, high density, excellent surface quality as well as a broader film/matrix interface achieved by PIII-D process.

Microstructure, composition and optical band gap of the films were investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV-visible spectrophotometer, respectively. The results showed that carbon-doped titanium monoxide films (C-TiO) with a carbon concentration of 5.8 at.% were obtained in an Ar/CO2 mixed atmosphere. However, carbon-doped rutile and anatase (C-TiO2) with a carbon concentration of about 1.4 at.% were obtained in an Ar/CO2/O2 mixed atmosphere. The optical band gaps of C-TiO and C-TiO2 were about 2.6 and 2.9 eV, respectively. Both of them were narrower than that of pure TiO2 films. Films with narrowed optical band gap energy are promising in promoting their photo-catalytic activity. © The Chinese Society for Metals and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

84901696423	The stability of DLC film on nitrided CoCrMo alloy in phosphate buffer solution	CoCrMo alloy is often used as the material for metal artificial joint, but metal debris and metal ions are the main concern on tissue inflammation or tissue proliferation for metal prosthesis. In this paper, nitrogen ion implantation and diamond like carbon (DLC) film composite treatment was used to reduce the wear and ion release of biomedical CoCrMo substrate. The mechanical properties and stability of N-implanted/DLC composite layer in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) was evaluated to explore the full potential of N-implanted/DLC composite layer as an artificial joint surface modification material. The results showed that the DLC film on N implanted CoCrMo (N-implanted/DLC composite layer) had the higher surface hardness and wear resistance than the DLC film on virgin CoCrMo alloy, which was resulted from the strengthen effect of the N implanted layer on CoCrMo alloy. After 30 days immersion in PBS, the structure of DLC film on virgin CoCrMo or on N implanted CoCrMo had no visible change. But the adhesion and corrosion resistance of DLC on N implanted CoCrMo (N-implanted/DLC composite layer) was weakened due to the dissolution of the N implanted layer after 30 days immersion in PBS. The adhesion reduction of N-implanted/DLC composite layer was adverse for in vivo application in long term. So researcher should be cautious to use N implanted layer as an inter-layer for increasing CoCrMo alloy load carrying capacity in vivo environment. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of Ti interlayer and thickness of Ti-O film on the film adhesion was investigated by the scratch test and tension test. After different tensile strain, the corrosion behavior of Ti-O coated CoCrMo alloy and bare CoCrMo alloy was also investigated by polarization tests. The results showed that the deposition of Ti interlayer can obviously improve the film adhesion and the film adhesion decreased with film thickness increase. In addition, the 30. nm Ti-O film with 10. nm Ti interlayer had excellent adhesion and it could withstand 30% relative elongation without obvious delamination. The corrosion resistance of Ti-O coated CoCrMo alloy was superior to bare CoCrMo alloy after different tensile strain. Due to its good adhesion and corrosion resistance after different tensile strain, the HPPMS Ti-O film had a potential application on CoCrMo alloy cardiovascular stent surface modification. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84912575598	In vitro cytocompatibility evaluation of hydrogenated and unhydrogenated carbon films	Hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) films and unhydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C) films are promising as artificial joint coatings due to their excellent wear resistance. In this paper, the cytocompatibility of a-C:H film and a-C film was evaluated to determine the more appropriate type for prosthesis modification. The a-C:H film was deposited by electron convolute resonance plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (ECR-PECVD) and a-C film was fabricated by magnetic filtered cathodic vacuum arc (MFCVA). The microstructure and physical characteristics of the films were investigated by Raman spectroscopy, contact angle measurement, atom force microscopy (AFM), electrokinetic analysis, electrical resistivity measurement and Hall effect measurement. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and serum protein adsorption on a-C and a-C:H films was determined by micro BCA assay. RAW264.7 macrophages were cultured on the a-C:H and a-C films for 24. h to evaluate the cell death, cell activation and inflammatory cytokine release. Primary mouse osteoblasts were cultured on the a-C:H and a-C films for 2. h, 1. day, 3. days and 6. days with biological tests performed to evaluate the cell adhesion, cell viability and cell morphology. The results show that a-C film is N type semiconductor with unpaired electrons. Protein adsorption assay shows that the a-C film can covalently bind more serum proteins than a-C:H film. The unpaired electrons of a-C film contribute to its better ability to covalently bind bioactive proteins than a-C:H film, and the superior adsorption and bioactivity of the adhesion proteins on a-C film further induce the better biological performance of a-C film. In a word, a-C film induces lower inflammatory reaction and higher ostoblasts viability than a-C:H film.

13244260710	Characterization of TiO2 films prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering at different oxygen partial pressures	Titanium oxide film has been expected as coating for cardiovascular devices due to its excellent biocompatibility. Titania thin films were synthesized by the pulse unbalanced magnetron sputtering method in this study. The effect of the oxygen partial pressures on the film properties has been studied. Titanium oxide films were deposited onto Ti6Al4V, glass and silicon(100) wafer by dc reactive magnetron sputtering from a titanium metallic target purity 99.9% in an Ar+O2 gas mixture. The films structure and composition of the films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in a grazing angle configuration and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The mechanical properties of the films were assessed by ball-on-disk tribometer and Knoop micro-hardness tester, respectively. The light absorption behavior of films was measured by UV755B spectrophotometer and the band gap of the films was calculated using absorption curve. The sessile method of contact angle measurement was carried out on a JY-82 goniometer on sheet samples using eight kinds of liquids. And the surface energy of the films was calculated using contacting angle. The results of XRD and XPS suggested that the oxygen partial pressures during the deposition could affect the film structure and composition greatly. Non-stoichiometric titanium oxide films were obtained under a critical oxygen partial pressure whereas above the pressure stoichiometric or hyperstoichiometric rutile were formed. The dimensions of the grains are about tens of nm. The mechanical properties of the films slightly decrease with the increase of oxygen partial pressure due to the reduction of the thickness of the films from 260nm to 70nm. The results of the contacting angles show that oxygen partial pressure could change the contacting angle as well as surface energy and the interface energy of films in a extent. The optical absorption of the films indicates that the transmittance of the films and the band gaps of the films are vary with oxygen partial pressure. The varieties of the factors influence hemocompatibility of the Titanium oxide films greatly.

13244260940	Effect of characteristics on the behavior of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) onto titanium oxide film surface fabricated by plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIIID)	It is believed that covering of endothelial cells on artificial cardiovascular devices surface may overcome surface induced thrombosis occurrence because of non-thrombogenic properties of the nature endothelial cells in contacting with blood. Therefore, endothelialization of prosthesis surface has been regard as an important mean to prevent thrombogenicity. Our previous research results revealed that the optimum Ti-O film possessed excellent blood compatibility. In this paper, we purposefully synthesized Ti-O films onto Si(100) wafer using plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIII-D) with different process parameters for investigating the tissue compatibility of films with endothelial cell. The characteristics of the Ti-O films were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Atom force microscopy (AFM). The biological behavior of endothelial cells on the film surface was studied by in vitro HUVEC culture investigation. A series of Ti-O films were synthesized by generating Ti plasma from a Ti cathode mounted on the metal vacuum-arc plasma source and incorporating with oxygen. The analysis results proved out that the films possessed different characterization such as crystal structure, composition, and surface morphology etc. Investigation in vitro of the cultured HUVEC on Ti-O film surface enunciated that the growth, proliferation behavior of endothelial cells on different film material surface was significant different. The adherence, growth, shapes, and proliferation of endothelial cells on Ti-O film with crystalline, low surface energy, and smoother surface was excellent.

In this work, the amorphous carbon nitride films and DLC films were deposited on silicon wafer substrates using a vacuum arc system. Surface thrombogenicity of the two films was evaluated by in vitro tests. An LDH assay was used to examine the platelets attached to the film surfaces. An F1+2 assay was used to evaluate the activation of clotting cascade. The fibrinogen adsorption and its conformational change were also investigated by using an immunoassay technique. The results show that the anti-thrombotic properties of the films were improved by nitrogen doping, This improvement is due to the inhibition of conformational change of adsorbed fibrinogen, preventing the adhesion of platelets and activation of clotting cascade.

However, it has not been revealed how the anti-thrombotic effect roots from a certain amorphous carbon films with particular structure and surface properties. In this work, we focus on the relationship between the electron structure and wettability of amorphous hydrogenated carbon (a-C:H) and its blood compatibility. A series of films with different electron structure and wettability were fabricated using plasma immersion ion implantation - deposition (PIII-D), followed by annealing in vacuum between 200-600°C. They were characterized by Raman, elastic recoil detection (ERD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The physical properties and surface characteristics of the films including the carrier concentration and mobility, resistivity and band gap were also examined. The thrombogenesis of the films was evaluated employing in vitro platelet adhesion tests. The results were correlated with the biological data to elucidate the blood compatibility mechanism of a-C:H films. The platelet adhesion and activation of a-C:H is affected by annealing. It is believed that the possible factors affecting blood compatibility are the adhesion energy of blood plasma, band gap, carrier type and concentration. Improving the electronic structure of a-C:H films is critical to the abatement of platelet activation.

13244299012	TiN synthesized by filtered arc deposition combined with electron cyclotron resonance	Titanium nitride thin films possess many good properties including blood compatibility but the properties are strongly dependent on the fabricating process. In this work, TiN films were deposited on 316L substrate using filter arc deposition (FAD) combined with and without electron cyclotron resonance (ECR), and the properties of the two types of films were evaluated. The first group TiN films were deposited using the Ti ion beam produced by a filtered arc source in a nitrogen ambient, whereas the second set of samples were deposited using FAD with an ECR-sustained nitrogen plasma. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to determine the structure, nano-indentation measurements were used to evaluate the hardness, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was utilized to evaluate the surface morphology, and pin-on-disk tribology tests were employed to assess the wear resistance. XRD results show that the films deposited by FAD with or without ECR process possess a single TiN phase, but the crystallographic orientation of the film changes from (111) to both (111) and (200) with the introduction of ECR excitation. This indicates that stress relief occurs during high energy bombardment or implantation and the thermal spike annealing effect is brought about by the ECR process. Nano-indentation results reveal that the nano-hardness of the samples synthesized by FAD with ECR can attain a value of about 15GPa, compared to 7.9GPa for the sample prepared by FAD alone. The film is densified with the stress changing from tensile or compressive due to the higher degree of ion bombardment from the ECR ignited plasma. AFM results disclose that both types of films are nano-sized crystalline and crack-free, but the surface of the FAD/ECR films tends to be rougher possibly due to more substantial sputtering effects. The friction coefficients and residual tracks revealed by pin-on-disk tests shows that the FAD/ECR film exhibits obviously higher wear resistance than that prepared by FAD alone and the enhancement can be explained by stress relief as well.
