40449086415	Study on maize leaf morphological modeling and mesh simplification of surface	According to the need of canopy visualization calculation in the digital plant research, we introduced a method, using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) interpolation and multi-line segment splitting algorithm, to reconstruct the 3D morphological structure of maize leaf with a complexity controllable mesh. Using the data cloud obtained by digitizer, construct the surface of maize leaf by calculating the knot vectors and reverse calculating surface control points by difference calculation. The final visualization effect is realistic. According to leaf morphological characteristics, leaf surface mesh can be simplified by using inverse calculation of multi-line segment splitting algorithm, and the surface main characteristics can be maintained simultaneously. This method can be used in canopy visualization calculation and light distribution calculation. Results showed that it can improve the calculation efficiency obviously without increase the calculation error. © 2008 International Federation for Information Processing.

In this method, human face is simulated by using a piece of NURBS surface, and the model points of NURBS surface are affected by MPEG-4 feature points.

63649113272	Image reconstruction for face recognition based on fast ICA	Traditional ICA (Independent Component Analysis) -based Face Recognition methods obtain a universal subspace by using all trained images. The subspace mainly represents the commonness of human faces but there are a few sights of the individuality owned by a single person's face. In this paper, based on Fast ICA and image reconstruction, we present a novel method for face recognition. When applied to face recognition, the fundamental difference between the traditional ICA and our method is that we obtain the basis images by using each person's pictures respectively, while the traditional way uses the whole training images of the database. After the step above, we obtained the features which would be employed to reconstruct the images by mapping the test images to the basis images. And then we use two ways for face recognition, the first way is adopting the minimum reconstruction error and the second is employing support vector machine (SVM) by using the reconstruction error vectors. Finally, experiments based on three different databases illustrate the effectivity of these methods.

To rapidly determine merging boundaries, collision detection techniques are used to obtain the intersection triangle pairs between the two input models, and then the intersection line loops are accurately computed. Furthermore, triangle tessellation and edge searching method is used to generate new triangles and classify each triangle in models into different triangle sets. Finally, an inclusion test determines the position of each triangle set and stitches the labeled triangle sets into the merged model. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of the presented method. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84883676771	An approach of mocap data-driven animation for virtual plant	Animation of virtual plant is a hot issue both in computer graphics and virtual reality. In this paper, the motion capture (mocap) is used for plant motion data acquisition, and a motion capture data-driven animation approach is presented. A maize plant is used as an example. First, a scanned data-based virtual model is created. And then, several typical passive motions of the plant such as «swing» and «dragging» are captured by a motion capture device. By means of a proposed mapping and deformation algorithm, the motions are reconstructed and the animation is implemented. The experiments show that the method is an effective and robust approach for animation of plant. Finally, the main contributions and limitations are discussed, and future works are introduced.

84883887172	Three-dimensional reconstruction method from construction drawings of solar-greenhouses based on semantic driving	The three-dimensional modeling techniques based on construction drawings have illustrated a good prospect of applications in virtual simulation, scene design, engineering modeling and calculation. Due to the complexity and diversity of structure information in construction drawings, the three-dimensional reconstruction based on construction drawings is still a great challenge. In this paper, a modeling method based on semantic mapping was presented to reconstruct three-dimensional models of solar-greenhouses from construction drawings. The construction drawings of solar-greenhouse with DXF formats were analyzed to obtain the structure elements which consisted of basic graphics primitives, text and annotation etc. The semantics models of the main characteristic components of solar-greenhouse were then built, and used to classify these structure elements into individual semantic components according to the recognition and understanding of their coordination, geometric features and text information. Moreover, the parameters models were also defined based on the hierarchical control parameters which consisted of all the structure, topology and texture parameters of the three-dimensional solar-greenhouses. After the semantic mapping mechanism between semantics and parameters models was built, the semantic driving method could conveniently generate the three-dimensional models from construction drawings. Among the above steps, the object-oriented analysis and design were used to refine two-dimensional geometric primitives and three-dimensional objects, and the photo-realistic rendering techniques were used to implement the visualization of the generated models. Based on the semantics-driven and parameters-driven mechanism, the presented method integrated CAD drawings, three-dimensional modeling and visualization techniques to reconstruct the three-dimensional solar-greenhouses from construction drawings. Finally, two sets of construction drawings were respectively tested. The results demonstrate this method is not only beneficial to improve the efficiency in reading the drawings, but the generated model with fidelity, interactivity and photo-realistic features can be used for the construction quantity and cost computation, structural optimization and the virtual exhibition.

84885116022	Interactive animation system for virtual maize dynamic simulation	Virtual plant modelling is becoming a hot issue both in computer graphics and agricultural researches. However, highrealistic plant modelling and plant animation is still a problem both in theory and applications. In this study, an interactive animation method for virtual maize dynamic simulation is presented, and an experimental system is developed by using C + + program language and OpenGL library. Firstly, true three-dimensional data and structural parameters of maize plant are collected as the foundation of modelling and animation.

84892882363	Investigate maize ear traits using machine vision with panoramic photography	Maize ear morphological characteristics have important applications in breeding, germplasm, and cultivation areas, subject to the extent of technology development in relevant areas, but the approach of surveying morphological characteristics is not highly automatic. In this paper, we present a new machine vision based method and a supporting device for maize ear morphological characteristic surveying. First, the maize ear was placed on a rotating component, which rotates the maize ear in a fixed angle interval in order to capture 16 images more or less. A preprocess was carried out of maize ear image sequences to remove the image background, and the remaining part of the maize ear image was passed to the next process. The SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) was used to extract image feature points, and the feature points in the neighboring images could be matched up according to SIFT feature points. The relative motion between the two images could be described by a homography, and an overdetermined equations composed of matching points and homography make specific values of homography available. Mismatched feature points will reduce the accuracy of the homography equation solution dramatically. We adopted a RANSAC (random sample consensus) method to remove the outlier of the matching points during the homography solving process. Secondly, according to the motion described by homography, the first image and the next image are registered to the same coordinate system, using the dynamic programming method to find the seam-line in the two images, cutting the redundancy region in the two images along the seam-line. Since the exposure of the two images had certain differences which led to image brightness near seam-line being slightly different, a weighted Gaussian filter was imposed on both sides of the stitching image to eliminate exposure difference. Finally, the fusion image according to the order in sequence generated the ear panorama, row number, number in a row, kernel number, and other parameters were extracted by processing the maize ear panorama. The experimental results showed that: there is no significant difference between the method proposed by this paper and manual measurement, and the method proposed can greatly strengthen the automation of the maize ear traits investigation.

84904168266	Automatic measurement of numbers of maize seedlings based on mosaic imaging	The missing amount of planted corn seedlings plays an important role in corn yield, to acquire it automatically, a new system based on machine vision has been developed. System hardware includes: one Industrial Personal Computer, a Central Processing nit: Intel (r) CPU i5@3.4GHz, 4 Gb of memory, one mvc3000 high speed Industrial camera (24FPS), and one Pentax len 8.5 mm f/1.5. The software development environment includes: Win7 Operating System, Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Professional, and OpenCV1.0. The core of the system is the image processing method. Firstly, image sequences obtained along plant rows from a top view under in-field lighting conditions were registered to the uniform coordinate system. Secondly, plant pixel (vegetation) was segmented from the background with a pixel classifier trained by a neural network. The segmentation method employed a decision surface in color space that was defined by only three parameters. This surface was a a truncated ellipsoidal surface which was robust in outdoor field images under varying lighting conditions. A simple parallel algorithm working on 8-connectivity was implemented, whereby skeletonization extracts a network of thin curves that describe the overall shape or "skeleton" of objects in a binary image. Due to limitations in camera resolution and non-ideal lighting conditions, the minimum gray level point along the plant skeleton is the best estimation of the actual stem location. The minimum gray pixel area was searched along the plant skeleton, and the center of minimum gray pixel area was marked as the stem center. Finally, a plant row line was fitted by stem centers; a model that predicts a linear relationship between the stem centers and the corn plant row was defined, and the parameters of linear function was estimated by a least-squares fit. Stem centers were projected onto the row line, and the average plant spacing was calculated by a projected point. The number of missing plants between two neighbored seedlings has a linear relationship of plant average spacing. On three varieties of 10 repeats each, a 10 m long row field experiment was performed, In a low density experiment, measurement results of the method agree with manual measurements of 7 in 10 and 3 in 10 have a difference of one plant. In a high density experiment, measurement results of the method agree with a manual measurement 6 in 10 and 4 in 10 have a difference up to two plants. Comparison with a manual measurement and our method, a high correlation on the two methods was found; this method can replace manual measurement, reduce time cost and human labor effort, and improve the degree of automation of the corn seedling missing survey.

84907873868	Maize leaf movement monitoring base on binocular stereo vision	A binocular stereo vision maize leaf motion monitoring system was proposed, the system includes a binocular camera, horizontal movement module, the vertical movement module, the image acquisition card, and a computer. The supporting structure holds camera above the measured maize leaf, and the camera is able to capture image pair at 30 f/s. An image processing program includes image acquisition, image pre-processing, markers extraction, sub-pixel edge refinement, 3D reconstruction and other modules. A fluorescent ball (diameter 0.35 cm) with high reflectivity was chosen as a marker, and its intensity is higher than the background environment which makes it easier to extract contour of ball out of background. The spherical marker will keep its circular shape more or less after perspective projection. In order to further improve the accuracy of stereo matching, a sub-pixel edge detection method based on gradient magnitude was adopted. In the simulation experiment, the camera was set away from the measured object about 50 cm, the system measurement deviation was 0.0139 cm, which is able to detect the small changes of leaf position. In field experiments, the actual measurement of the movement leaf caused by growth and physiological responses achieved the desired results.

84919348576	PlantCAD: An integrated graphic toolkit for modelling and analyzing plant structure	In this paper, we present PlantCAD, a graphic toolkit for the creation, simulation and analysis of 3D virtual plants. This C++-based geometric toolkit allows easy generation of plant organs including leaves, fruits, branches, petioles and even nonbotanical things which makes it a powerful user-interactive platform for plant modeling in various biological application. Based on the basic geometric components dedicated to different organs, PlantCAD provides several methods to create plant structure from either real measured data or procedural models. Realistic appearance of the generated 3D plants is improved by using texture mapping and including hairs that cover many plant organs. Several examples from different modelling applications illustrate how PlantCAD can be used to construct, analyse or manipulate geometric models at different scales ranging from organs to plant communities.

84924419804	Three-dimensional reconstruction and characteristics computation of corn ears based on Machine vision	Three-dimensional shape descriptors of corn ears are important traits in corn breeding, genetic and genomics research, however it is difficult to accurately and consistently measure 3D features of corn ears by hand or traditional tools. This study presents a 3D modeling method based on machine vision to reconstruct the 3D model of corn ears for quantitative feature computation and analysis. Firstly, a simple machine vision system is designed to capture images of corn ears from different angles of view. The corn ears in these images are then registered in the uniform coordinate system using a rapid process pipeline which consists of image processing, object detection, distortion correction and registration in pixel level etc. After the registration, the point sets in edge contours and center skeletons of corn ears are used to reconstruct the surface model based on resample and interpolation techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that the presented method can not only build realistic 3D models of corn ears for visualization, also be used to accurately compute geometric characteristics.
