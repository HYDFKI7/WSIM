14844297390	The effect of current crowding on electromigration in lead-free flip chip bump interconnect	Nowadays the issues about reliability of IC caused by electromigration (EM) become very important. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3-D) model is presented to simulate the distribution of current density in lead-free flip chip bump interconnect. By the simulation, the effect of current crowding on electromigration in lead-free flip chip bump interconnect is studied. The simulation results show that when high current flows into and out of solder bump, current crowding occurs and large joule heat is generated. Through the analysis of experimental results, it can be found that the current crowding accelerates the electromigration in lead-free flip chip bump interconnect combined with joule heat. The extent of electromigration where the electron flow enters the under bump metallization (UBM) is more severe than other places in the cathode of the lead-free solder bump. © 2004 IEEE.

24044445221	Sn whisker issues on lead-free finish of electronic devices	Sn whiskers up to hundreds of microns in length grow spontaneously from the surface of pure Sn lead-free finish in some cases, resulting in serious reliability problems such as short circuit in the lifetime of electronic devices. It was widely accepted that Sn whisker growth was mostly driven by compressive stress. Sn whiskers grow from Sn atoms migration through diffusion or dislocation mechanism. Diffusion barriers formed by Ni finish layer and/or heat treatment to suppress whisker growth were practical used. Temperature cycling was commonly used in Sn whisker accelerated growth test.

2342616688	Effect of current density and geometry structure on Pb-free solder joints electromigration	Pb-free solders will replace traditional Sn-Pb solders to correspond with green-packaging strategy. In this paper, a 2-D model was presented to study the electromigration (EM) in Pb-free solder joints (Sn-Ag-Cu). Some geometry patterns of Cu thin films were designed and interconnected with Pb-free solder joint. The current density distribution in the special geometry pattern interconnect was analyzed with ANASYS. And then the testing data were obtained to compare with the simulation results. Numerical simulation showed that current density crowding occurred because of the interconnect geometry changes, which resulted in inhomogeneous drift of metal atoms. For a given geometry Pb-free interconnect, it was found that voids nucleated at IMCs interface where current density was crowding excessively and propagated along the current-density gradient direction. In the meantime, some hillocks were observed at IMCs interface of the anode. In addition, IMCs dissolved at the cathode or formed at the anode, then whose boundary migrated in EM process. Those phenomena were fully accorded with the prediction from simulation results. Finally, EM driving forces were applied to explain these phenomena.

2342652154	Effects of heating factors on the geometry size of unrestricted lead-free joints	In this paper, the effects of heating factor on the geometry size of unrestricted lead-free joints were investigated. The morphologies of IMC formed in the joint were studied in detail by using SEM and EDX. When the Sn3.5AgO.5Cu solder joint was formed in unrestricted condition, the width of the joint and the mean thickness of interfacial IMC increased with the increase of heating factor. The volume of the joint was larger than the volume of the Sn3.5AgO.5Cu solder, but the effects of heating factor on the change of volume were undulate. The morphologies of the interfacial IMC were needle-like when heating factor was small, and then, grew, coarsened when heating factor increased. The tensile fractography of the joint indicated that the morphologies of IMC at fracture surface were various. Some of IMCs shaped like pyramid, and some of JMCs shaped like needle. And part of the fracture surface located in the solder, and part of the fracture surface located at the interface between the interfacial IMC and solder.

33744997417	A reflow soldering retro-design system for rework station based on Q-factor	Currently reflow soldering is the primary process used for the assembly of PCBs. There now have finite difference (FD) and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling tool, which can establish the reflow soldering process models and compute out the detailed representations of the real reflow ovens. This paper presents the development of a reflow soldering retro-design system for rework station with the above modeling tools. Heating factor (Q-factor) is used to evaluate whether the achieved profile fulfils the soldering task well despite the real curve different from the ideal one. The behavior of adjusting the heat profile to make the feature points meet the requirements of components and solders computationally may then get the optimal profile without any actual reflow running. Meanwhile, the system introduces the close-loop implementation of process recipe on the device controller so as to enhance the execution repeatability. This system is used to set the bottom and top heater profiles of Metcal APR-5000 rework station. © 2005 IEEE.

The results show that the width of the joint and the mean thickness of interfacial IMC increase as the cycles of reflow increases. The morphology of IMCs at solder/under bump metallurgy (UBM) interface was needle-like after reflow was carried out firstly and was coarsened after following reflows were done. Some of them spalled into the solder joint. The tensile strength changed slightly in the same condition. The tensile fracture surface was found in the solder after reflow was done firstly. The fracture surface was seen in the solder partly and the one was seen in the interface between UBM and solder partly, after reflows were carried out many times.

33846271790	The growth behavior of intermetallic compound layer at solder/Cu joint interface during soldering	In this paper, the growth behavior of intermetallic compound (IMC) layer at solder/Cu interface during soldering had been studied by using three Pb-free solder, Sn-3.5Ag, Sn-3.5Ag-0.5Cu and Sn-0.7Cu alloys. Meanwhile, Sn63-Pb37 eutectic alloy was used for comparision. In order to study the effects of reaction time on the formation and the growth behavior of IMC layer between four different solder and Cu substrate, the specimens were reacted at the temperature of 260°C for 30s, 60s, 90s, 240s and 480s respectively. Optical microscope (OM) was used to measure the thickness of IMC layers and observe the microstructure of solder joint. The results show that the mean thickness of interfacial IMC layers increased with the increase of reaction time for the same solder, but the effects of reaction time on the thickness of IMC layer was not monotonous, when the reaction time prolonged to 480s, the mean thickness of IMC layer of Sn-0.7Cu and Sn63-Pb37 solder joints decreased mildly. The high content of Sn in Pb-free solder can cause a more rapid consumption of Cu. So, by contrast with three Pb-free solders, Sn63-Pb37/Cu joints have the thinnest IMC layer for each reaction time. The chemical reaction intensity of following four solders with Cu weakens as the order listed below: Sn3.5Ag, Sn3.5Ag0.5Cu, Sn0.7Cu, Sn63Pb37. We found a surprising phenomenon that some Cu blocks/particles distributed in the IMC layer or near the IMC layer, and when the immerging time was long enough, the faultage usually emerged at the solder/substrate interface of the solder joints. © 2005 IEEE.

A film stress measuring apparatus by SCM was developed, and stresses in Ag/Cu multiplayer thin films and reflow solder on Cu thin films in Si(111) prepared by RF magnetron sputtering were detected. The stress-temperature behavior was studied. The stresses in Ag/Cu multiplayer thin films were different due to different temperature. The stresses in reflow solder on Cu thin films in Si(111) were different due to the generation of excessive amounts of Intermetallic Compound.

33846303169	A study of thermosonic gold wire bonding onto silver plated copper pad	A Thermosonic (TS) bonding process for gold wire bonded onto copper pad was successfully developed by plating a thin, silver passivation layer on the copper pad. The copper pad oxidizes easily at elevated temperature during TS wire bonding. The bondability and bonding strength of the gold ball onto copper pads are significantly deteriorated if a Cu-oxide film exists. To overcome this intrinsic drawback of the copper pad, a silver thin film was plated onto it to improve the bondability and bonding strength. Ultrasonic power, bonding time and bonding force are the most important process parameters for a sound bonding. In order to study the effects of these process parameters on bond shear force and the region of bonding, gold wire bonding was performed on a Kulicke&Soffa 1484XQ wire bonder with the silver plated copper pads. This study showed that an appropriate combination of ultrasonic power, bonding force and time is very necessary to obtain optimal bonded bumps. The application of higher ultrasonic power or higher bonding force not only results in a larger bonded area, but also causes excessive deformation of the bump, which may not be acceptable. With an increase in power, the bond shear force also increased and reached a maximal value, but with further increase of power, shear force would decrease. Bonding force showed the similar trend as bonding power, the bond shear force increased with bonding force up to an optimum value, but decreased gradually with further increase of bonding force. In contrast to the effects of ultrasonic power and bonding force on bond shear force, the bond shear force increased with the increase of bonding time monotonously in a certain range of bonding time. © 2005 IEEE.

34250823595	Low cost smart labels assembled by anisotropically conductive adhesive	The most urgent issue on the way of popularizing the smart labels is cutting their cost. Various ways have been explored to approach this goal, but the cost of a smart label is still hanging around decades of cents. Attaching a RFID flip chip on a paper or plastic substrate is one of the most competitive technologies for low cost smart label manufacturing. Anisotropically conductive adhesive (ACA) and semiautomatic heat-sealing machine were developed to accomplish the smart label inlay assembly process by interconnecting the RFID flip chip on aluminum antenna/plastic substrate. Fast cure of ACA in seconds at low temperatures enables to speed up the assembly processing, as well as to utilize the low-cost temperature-sensitive substrate like PET. Advantages of this environmentally friendly process make it quite possible to be applied in a high speed roll-to-roll smart label line. Reliability assessment on the electric and mechanic properties demonstrated that the products exceeded the specification requirements. © 2006 IEEE.

34948858362	Analysis of dark stain on chip surface of high-power LED	In the process of aging or in service of some high power blue LEDs, dark stain may occur on the LED chip surface, which cast a shadow over the chip and thus led to the losing of luminous flux. In the degraded samples, it was found that firstly the dark stain was formed on the chip surface equably, and then the color of this stain gradually darken with time. In this paper, this kind of dark stain was detected and analyzed. The morphology of the dark stain and the elements contained in it were measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Analysis by X-ray (EDAX), respectively. A large mount of oxygen and carbon were found in the black zones, which implied that some chemical reactions occurred on the interface. After we removed the black materials off the chip surface, the quantity of luminous flux evidently increased. The origin of oxygen and the possible reason of the dark stain were also discussed. © 2006 IEEE.

The miniature lead free solder joint was formed with Sn-3.5Ag-0.5Cu or Sn-3.5Ag solder alloys and two copper bars that the ends were plated with Ni and Au. Several sizes of micro-joints were gotten to measure the effect of IMCs proportion. Optical microscope (OM) was used to observe the changes of interfacial IMCs of different miniature joints. Maximal shear strength force and maximal impact force were tested to evaluate the effect of miniaturization on the reliability. The results showed that the interfacial IMCs proportion of solder joints increased when they were aged at 150 °C for 0 hours, 120 hours, and 200 hours or the sizes of solder joints changed from 100 μm to 20 μm. The maximal shear strength and maximal impact force of the solder joints decreased when the interfacial IMCs proportion increased. ©2006 IEEE.

Sample series were made under various bonding temperatures. Electric properties of the as-assembled inlays including contact resistance and insulation resistance, as well as their mechanical properties like pull-shear strength and chip adhesion shear strength, were measured and compared. After that, reliability tests, such as high temperature / humidity test 85 °C, 85% RH, 168h, high temperature store test 85 °C, 168h, were performed on these samples and the aforementioned properties were also retested. It was found that at the temperatures lower than 160 °C, cured ACA can't provide enough adhesion strength, while at the temperatures higher than 170 °C, the adhesion strength after reliability test decreased due to the weakening of the adhesion strength though the contact resistance is smaller. Thus the best bonding parameters of this kind of ACA for preparing the RFID tag inlay were 160°C, 3N, 10 s. ©2006 IEEE.

34948899716	Solder paste printability tester and method	Solder paste print property is critical to product yield in a SMT (Surface Mount Technology) line. Investigation has shown that poor solder paste printability results in a large amount of defects. In this letter, basing on the rolling phenomenon during solder paste printing process, a novel tester was developed to measure the solder paste printability. This device offers a uniform printing condition, such as squeegee angle, printing pressure and speed etc. to discern the different printing features among various solder pastes. The characteristic of this device is using a "squeegee-roller" printing mechanism, that is, the stencil is designed like a roller or a drum that makes it possible to perform continuous print action. During printing test, a J-shape probe was employed to pierce into the surface of the solder paste to detect the tangential force induced by the rolling of solder paste. Using this machine, two brands of SnPb and SnAgCu solder pastes were tested. It was found that the printing life of Brand A excelled that of Brand B, and the evolutions of the rolling tangential forces exhibited different characteristics between SnPb and SnAgCu solder paste, where the tangential force of SnPb solder paste rose to a maximum and then quickly it ceased to roll at a high rolling rate, but the tangential force of SnAgCu solder paste declined slowly all along. In a word, this tester has the potential to offer a quantitative and low cost evaluation on the printability of solder paste. ©2006 IEEE.

37349025387	Behavior of whisker growth from the pure Sn coating under the temperature cycling condition	In this study, some Cu leads with pure Sn coating in TO220 packaging were executed the temperature cycling (TC) tests to research their behaviors of whisker growth. Sn whisker growth in TC conditions had in a high rate, a high density and a uniform length. And a large amount of collapses were found on the coating relating to Sn whisker growth in high density. Due to the high temperature in per cycle, IMC growth provided a larger driving force for whisker formation. Moreover, the thermal stress caused by the mismatch of CTE in different materials provided an additional driving force. Sn whiskers initiated from some grains in special orienta-tions throughout the cracks on the surface generated by thermal stress. As a result, numerous collapses appeared on the surface of coating to supply Sn whisker growth sufficiently.

37649030238	Solder paste printability tester	Solder paste printability is one of the most critical properties in SMT (Surface Mount Technology). Investigation has shown that poor solder paste printing results in various SMA (Surface Mount Assembly) defectives. In this letter, a novel solder paste printability tester has been constructed with a characteristic "squeegee-roller" print motion, in which the roller served as a "annular stencil". This motion can perform a continuous scraping action and ensure an accurate control of printing distance, as well as printing pressure, angle, and speed. As a result, this tester enable both online and offline method to evaluate the solder paste printing performance. Offline method such as soldering ball test and wetting test reveals that, with the printing distance increasing, flux residues became darker, solder beading number and wetting time increased, while wetting area reduced. These behaviors represented the decay of printability, wettability, solderability, etc. Based on the rolling phenomenon upon solder paste printing, a tooth-like stainless wire were immersed in and rotated with the paste sample, and thus the rolling rate can be detected. It is found that at first this rate decreased gradually, and finally dropped down suddenly to zero. The corresponding critical printing distance was suggested to act as a quantitative criterion to evaluate the printability of solder pastes. The results of the project illustrate that combination of offline and online method is a complete approach for solder paste printability evaluation and improvement.

This environmentally friendly conductive material offers numerous advantages over conventional solder technology and is an ideal substitute for the lead-contained solder in electronics packaging.

41049101022	Flex reliability of RFID inlays assembled by anisotropic conductive adhesive	Accompanied by the cost reduction and the assembly line speed increase, the drive to enhance the reliability of RFID tags is ever increasing due to the incremental puzzles on the tag response function. Anisotropic conductive adhesive (ACA) bonding is one of the main stream in a mass production of RFID inlay, but due to its nature of adhesive bonding and contact conduction, the increasing response problems emerges, especially when the ACA joint encounters the occasion that it needs to be flexed. A simple method to evaluate the flex reliability of the RFID inlays is developed in this study. A gold film is sputtered on the RFID flip chip to form a conductive layer, making the inlay strap becomes a conductor, and thus the contact resistance variety of ACA bonding joint can be detected. The ACA assembled inlays using this kind of dummy die are delivered to a serial tests: wind, static tensile and pure bend, while the DC resistance of these inlays is recorded simultaneously. It is found that the pure bend instead of static tensile results in irrecoverable enhancement of contact resistance of ACA joint. Besides, pure bend test with die facing down exhibit a less damage on the resistance than that with die facing up, because the former has a press effect while the latter exert a tear effect on the joint. © 2007 IEEE.

A study on the spectrophotometric determination of Cr(VI) contained in plastics, especially focused on influence of the processing parameters and interference factors in the extract and colorific process of Cr(VI) was performed. And subsequently a set of standard procedures including sample preparation, extraction, colorific reaction were established. It was found that the mixed alkali method could effectively extract Cr(VI) from complicated plastic matrices and eliminate the interference of Cr(III), simultaneously. By the exclusion of the coexisting ions, and optimizing several parameters such as pH, temperature, time and so on, the satisfactory results were achieved because the recovery rates were in the range of 90%~110% both for samples and standard solutions, RSDs were less than 1%, and the calibration exhibited the linear relation in the low concentration range (0~500 μg/L). All the above proved that the present method provided a high accuracy and sensitivity, as well as a simple and rapid procedure, thus offering a good technical support to comply with RoHS directive for the information industry.

42549143672	Relations between the chemical composition of Sn finish and Sn whisker growth under temperature cycling	The effects of electroplating chemicals on Sn whisker growth were studied under the temperature cycling test when JEDEC standard was used. After the temperature cycling test, Sn finish with low compact density was found to be easy to generate surface cracks, where whiskers grew with a high density and rate. By the contrast, a few surface cracks were found on the Sn finish with high compact density, and whiskers growth was in a very low quantity and rate. The results show that the compact density of the pure Sn finish is a great factor to form cracks on the surface. The high compact density of Sn finish would decrease surface defects and enhance strength of grain boundaries. Thus, the finish with high compact density could absorb more inner stress to resist micro defects formation. As a result, the surface crack formation was retarded and this would suppress Sn whisker growth from the surface defects.

The process of this test can be devided into four sequent stages: solvent effusion and volatilization, solder paste pattern shrinkage, solder ball shrinkage, stabilization. Another bubbling stage is separated alone, because it occurs erratically. All these stages associated with the defects and their possible reasons are described and discussed. It is found that the shrinking behavior and bubbling process are two key points to reflow process. Fast and stable shrinking, and exhaustive escaping of bubbles, are helpful to reduce the reflow defects.

4544296553	Effects of electromigration on IMC evolution in Pb-free solder joints	To meet the requirement of environment protection, Pb-free solders will replace traditional Sn-Pb solders in electronics manufacturing. Meanwhile, the trend of electronic components packaging toward miniaturization and high density makes the issue of electromigration (EM) more serious. In order to improve electronics reliability, it is essential to study EM in Pb-free solder joints. There are some phenomena of the EM in the solder, such as voids formation and propagation, pileup or "hillocks" formation and intermetallic compounds (IMCs) morphology variation,. In this paper, two groups of experiments are performed to investigate the effects of EM on IMC evolution in lead-free solder joints. One is thermal aging experiment and the other is EM experiment. In the thermal aging experiment, the IMC on the side of the substrate is thicker than it on the of the chip because the solder near the substrate suffers once more reflow cycle than it near the anode, In the EM experiment, under the influence of EM, IMC at the anode is thicker than it at the cathode. In addition, IMC will dissolute and reform in the solder, and migrate from the cathode to the anode. Finally, IMCs at the anode and cathode are both thicker than those in the thermal aging experiment.

52449085008	Thermo and mechanical study on integrated high-density packaging	With the demanding of market, the electronic portable products can be characterized by increasing signal frequencies and higher density of functions. The electronic products are expected to be produced smaller and smaller. There is one way to meet the requirement, which is a threedimensional integration of components. A new concept of a packaging structure is proposed based on an embedded chip structure. Chips and other components can be embedded directly into epoxy and then interconnections are realized by laser drilling and metallization. In the process, components are placed on a removable tacky film on a temporary or permanent base. The film and base temporarily immobilize them until the structure is encapsulated. The entire array of tested and bumed-in components thereby becomes a monolithic assembly, with each component now permanently immobilized by every part of it. The bottoms of these terminations can be exposed by removing the temporary base and film or by making holes in a permanent one by such means as mechanical abrasion, water-jet material removal, or laser ablation. The assembly is now ready to be metalized with copper using standard printed circuit additive (build-up) processing methods, with circuit patterns created to make the required interconnections among leads of all of the components. In most cases, more than one layer will be required, so an insulation layer is placed over it and the process is repeated until all required interconnections are made. Thermal and thermo-mechanical reliability are taken into account in this structure due to the encapsulation on the chips. For this purpose, numerical study by means of finite element analysis is available to check the desired properties. Thermal analysis aims to give the first insight to characterize the thermal performance for such structure under steady and transient condition. Epoxy around the chip also plays an important role in the heat dissipation. The thickness of copper has large influence on the thermal resistance. Besides, the copper in the top metallization layer of the package is also taken into account. Thermal stress between the copper and the epoxy is also considered in this paper. © 2008 IEEE.

52449086389	Effect of stand-off height on the microstructure and fracture mode of Cu/Sn-9Zn/Cu solder joint under tensile test	This study investigates the effect of the stand-off height (SOH) on the microstructure and tensile fracture mode of Cu/Sn9Zn/Cu solder joints. Solder joints with SOH of 100μm, 50μm and 20μm are studied. It is found that as the SOH is reduced, Zn content has a rapid decrease in the solder bulk, while, the intermetallic compound (IMC) layer proportion increases. SOH of the solder joint also has an important effect on the tensile strength and tensile fracture mode. Tensile strength of solder joints decreases with lower SOH, which correlates with the change of microstructare and composition in solder joint. When the SOH is reduced, the fracture path of solder joint transfers from the bulk of the solder joint into the IMC/solder interface, and the fracture mode tends to transform from ductile fracture into brittle fracture. © 2008 IEEE.

Solder bumps were formed with various reflow profiles and multi-reflow and then subjected to the impact test under a constant speed of 1.8m/s and a shear standoff of 50pm. The results show that the IMC status has a close relation with the impact behavior upon one reflow. When the heating factor increases beyond 800 s-°C, the thickness of IMC layer goes up, and the impact absorbed energy of solder bump raises quickly. Upon multi-reflow using the same profile, the IMC thickness changed a little but the failure modes varied a lot. © 2008 IEEE.

The contact resistance and shear bonding strength before and after the reliability tests (hot humidity test, 85 °C, RH 85%), and degradation mechanism of ACA interconnection for flip-chip-on-flex (FCOF) assembly were studied using modified RFIC and the three kinds of antennae mentioned above. It was found that the contact resistance changed after the reliability test, it was caused by the total results of oxidation of Al/PET antennae and conductive particles, mismatch of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the ACA adhesive, antennae and flip-chips and post curing of resin. And the bonding strength also affect by the further curing of paste, strain release accumulated in resin and the microstructure change caused by moisture absorption during the reliability test. It was concluded that it was benefit to improve the reliability of FCOF assembly packaged by ACA by introducing the post curing process. And it was suggested that selecting the anti-oxidation conductor and the anti-heat substrate of antennae could decrease the shift of contact resistance, which was especially favored for ultra-high frequency RFID tag. Therefore, the printed Ag/Paper antenna was preferred to large scale, cheap and rapid manufacturing RFID tags. © 2008 IEEE.

The results exhibited that using the microwave extraction system to prepare samples is more quick, lossless, contamination-free in comparison with the conventional extraction methods such as dry ashing, wet-oven extraction etc. By analyzing the recoveries of these four heavy metals over different working time and wavelengths, the good recovery range between 85% and 115% showed that there was only tiny loss or contamination during the process of microwave extraction, sample introduction and ICP detection. Repeatability experiments proved that ICP plasma had a good stability during the working time and the matrix effect was small. Interference was a problem troublesome for atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), however, the techniques of standard additions or inter-element correction (IEC) method can effectively eliminated the interferences of Ni, As, Fe etc. with the Cd determination. By employing the multi-wavelengths and two correction point methods, the issues of background curve sloping shift and spectra overlap were successfully overcome. Besides, for the determinations of trace heavy metal elements, the relative standard deviation (RSD) was less than 3% and the detection limits were less than 1μg·L

58149087346	Reliability of RFID tag inlay assembled by anisotropic conductive adhesive	ACA bonding is one of the main stream in a mass production for the fast and low cost RFID tag inlay assembly, however, its reliable issue is facing the increasing challenge due to the trend of using low cost materials and fast process. In this work, ACA was prepared by mixing Ag particles into thermoset epoxy resin. The inlays were manufactured by assembling the RFICs in a flip chip mode with this kind of ACA on the aluminum/PET antenna under 180°C, 12 sec. To investigate the variation of the contact resistance and the flex behavior, some RFICs were sputtered with a gold film on their bump face and became a conductor on the aluminum antenna terminals. The ACA assembled inlays were submitted to various electric and mechanical reliability tests. It was found that the resistance of the inlay with dummy die exhibited a periodic variation but totally an ascending trend in a wind test, indicating that the flex or bend action had a large influence on the conductivity of the adhesive joint. Further, pure bend test with die facing down exhibited a less damage on the resistance than that with die facing up, because the former exerts a press while the latter was tearing. Although the resistance shift of the adhesive joint may occur, the high frequency regular inlays of 13.56MHz remained 10 cm response distance upon hot humidity test and the 50 periods wind test. The results suggested that an improvement is necessary on the aluminum-antenna inlay packaged by ACA. ©2008 IEEE.

63049091612	Effect of stand-off height on microstructure and tensile strength of Cu/Sn9Zn/Cu Solder Joint	To investigate the effect of the stand-off height (SOH) on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of certain solder joints, Cu/Sn9Zn/Cu solder joints with SOH of 100μm, 50μm, 20μm and 10μm were prepared and studied. It was found that as the SOH is reduced, Zn content in solder bulk has a rapid decrease due to consumption by the reflow reaction, hence, the microstructure of solder bulk is changed significantly from a Sn-Zn eutectic structure to a hypoeutectic structure. By contrast, Cu content in solder bulk has a rapid increase with the reduced SOH, and this leads to form more dissociative IMC in solder bulk. These composition and microstructure changes of solder bulk induced by the reduced SOH correlate closely with the mechanical properties of solder joints. In our study, it's found that as SOH is reduced, tensile strength of solder joints decreases, fracture path of solder joint transfers from the solder bulk into the IMC/solder interface, and the fracture mode tends to change from ductile mode into brittle mode. These findings would point out a new way to enhance the mechanical properties of miniaturized solder joints by controlling the composition and dissociative IMCs in solder bulk. © 2008 IEEE.

70450061066	The effects of bonding parameters on the reliability performance of flexible RFID tag inlays packaged by anisotropic conductive adhesive	In this work, ACA was prepared by mixing micro-sized spherical Ag particles into thermo-set epoxy resin, and RFID flip chips were assembled on the Al/PET antennae through hot-press process.

The thermal overstress on the epoxy along the interface owing to the high junction temperature is the main factor to degrade the epoxy gradually. As a result, a darkening area made up of carbon as well its oxide occurs on the LED die surface and depresses the luminous efficiency. ©2009 IEEE.

76049094430	Effect of stand-off height on the microstructure and mechanical behaviour of solder joints	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of stand-off height (SOH) on the microstructure and mechanical behaviour of the solder joints in high density interconnection. Design/methodology/approach - Cu/Sn/Cu solder joints with 100, 50, 20 and 10μm SOH are prepared using a reflow process. The microstructures and compositions of solder joints are observed and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Tensile testing is carried out to investigate the mechanical properties of the solder joints. Findings - The SOH has a significant effect on the microstructure and mechanical behaviour of Cu/Sn/Cu solder joints. The thickness of the intermetallic compound (IMC) decreases with the reducing SOH; however, their corresponding IMC proportion increases. Meanwhile, the Cu concentration in the solder bulk experiences a marked increase, and the dissolved Cu exists in the forms of a solid solution and Cu-rich particles at the grain boundary. Because of the higher strain rate and more dissolved Cu in the solder bulk with the reducing SOH, the ultimate tensile strength of solder joints is enhanced. When the SOH reduces to 10μm, there is only one grain in height in the bulk, and a fracture in the IMC layer occurs. According to the mass balance of substance, a model is established to semi-quantitatively calculate the consumed Cu thickness, and it is found that the consumed Cu thickness decreases with the reducing SOH. Originality/value - The paper offers insights into the microstructural and mechanical property changes of the solder joints with the reducing SOH. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This also brings about an increase of the temperature which induces a very high temperature gradient in some local regions of micro interconnects. As a result, thermomigration will occur and metal atoms will move opposite to the direction of the temperature gradient. Thermomigration is one of common modes in reliability failures in electronic devices. This paper reviews and analyzes the previous researches on the thermomigration theory and experiment in stripe and solder interconnects under the temperature loading and the current/temperature loading.

The well-defined particles were synthesized by mixing the iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate solution with silver nitrate solution directly by high-speed stirring at room temperature. It is found that a large number of micro-sized and uniform spherical particles with rough surfaces are obtained. The mass ratio of iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate to silver nitrate greatly affects the shape of particles, and when it is relatively low, spherical particles cannot be obtained. The reaction temperature has a great impact on the particle size. As the reaction temperature increases from 8 to 15 °C, the mean diameter of particles decreases from 3.5 to 1.6 (m.

A direct current discharge apparatus was used to supply active nitrogen species during the deposition of carbon nitride films.

The influence of deposition pressure in the range 1-20Pa on the composition and bonding structure of carbon nitride films was studied.

The N/C ratio in the deposited films increases linearly with increasing deposition pressure to 10Pa, further increase of the deposition pressure results in the slight increase of N/C ratio.

To separate electromigration behavior, a novel apparatus was used to carry out the thermomigration experiment. The thermal finite-element simulation results showed that a sufficient thermal gradient existed in the Cu/Sn58Bi/Cu solder joint during the experiment. After loading a constant thermal gradient for over 100 hours, an obvious phase redistribution phenomenon occurred in the Sn58Bi solder layer. It was found that Bi atoms in the Sn58Bi solder layer had migrated toward the lower temperature side. Meanwhile, Bi-rich phase coarsening was detected in the Sn58Bi solder layer, and with the loading time increased, the Bi-rich phases went on coarsening. After thermomigration for 200 hours, a thin Bi-rich layer formed at the cold side of the Sn58Bi solder layer. Moreover, Kirkendall voids were produced in the intermetallic compound layers, with their number at the hot sides larger than that at the cold side. Compared with the aging test samples, Bi-rich phase aggregation only appeared at the cold side of the solder joint in thermomigration samples while the aggregation appeared at both sides in the 200h-aged samples, which further emphasized the great effects of thermomigration in the Sn58Bi solder joints. © 2011 IEEE.

81355132074	Improvement of the second bond strength in copper wire bonding on pre-plated leadframe	Due to the low cost and high mechanical and electrical properties of the copper wire as well as the environmental friendly pre-plated frame (PPF), copper wire bonding on PPF has been considered the most promising candidate to replace the gold wire bonding in actual volume production in the coming years. However, the nature of the copper, such as high hardness, sensitivity to oxidation, work hardening effect etc., coupled with the low adhesion between the copper wire and the PPF surface are the main causes to the low and unstable bonding strength, especially at the second bond. The proposed solution is to introduce a heat treatment after the PPF copper wire bonding. Two kinds of unsealed PPF copper wire bonding samples prepared under different parameters were submitted to a vacuum heat treatment at 200 7deg;C and 10-3 Pa for 10 min. It was found that the average wire pull strengths of both samples increased. The main wire pull break modes changed after vacuum heat treatment, i.e., the second bond lift-off disappeared and the heel breaks decreased after the heat treatment. The results indicate that the heat treatment enhances the interfacial adhesion of copper wire bonding on PPF, and increases the tensile strength of the second bonds. © 2011 IEEE.

A majority of researches have been devoted to understanding the failure mechanism of the thermomigration accompanied by the electromigration behavior; and based on the microstructure observation, the thermomigration in eutectic SnPb and other lead free solders in terms of SnBi, SnCu and SnAgCu has been investigated and the dominate diffusion element in each solder bulk has been identified according to the microstructure evolution. However, only a few works are focused on the theoretical analysis for this novel migration process. In this study, according to our previous research of the thermomigration in the composite SnPb solder bump of the flip chip system at low ambient temperature, the tendency of the each diffusion element in this composite SnPb solder is certificated based on the diffusion theory. It is proved that both Sn and Pb atoms in the solder bulk tend to migrate from the hot side to the cold side during thermomigration, and the different microstructure phenomenon appeared in the other studies, such as Sn and Pb atoms are detected to be the dominate diffusion element when the ambient temperature is higher and lower than 100°C respectively, is mainly due to the different diffusion rate of them. Furthermore, this conclusion can be set up as the universal law for the diffusion process under a certain thermal gradient, which indicates that no matter what kind of atoms they are in the solder bulk, all of them have the tendency to move from the hot zone to the cold zone due to the asymmetrical temperature distribution. On the other hands, the important thermomigration parameter, the molar heat flux Q*of Sn atoms in the SnPb solder alloy is calculated to be 19.1 kJ/mole. © 2011 IEEE.

Both cross section and Dye & Pry has been carried out to find out the fracture mode in the suspected pin of the failed unit. The cross section result shows that both BGA solder separation and PCB prepreg separation occurs there. Dye & Pry reveals that the crack pins mainly gather at corner "D" of this BGA, and 100% dye is presented there. In order to find out the root cause of this case, a series of destructive experiments have been carried out. Firstly, shear test of the raw BGA solder joint are performed. It reveals that there is no obvious difference for the solder strength between the BGA balls at the four corners and those in the center area, which indicates that the BGA raw material is not related to the root cause of this case. Secondly, in order to identify the point at which the ball crack are starting in production line, samples including bare PCB and assembled PCBA have been collected at different work station in both SMT and product build line, which will all act as the experiment specimens for a series of cross section and Dye & Pry of next step. The results show that the FCT (Functional Circuit Test) after SMT line is one of the suspected stations where the solder crack initiation will take place. After that, Strain gauge has been performed to check in both these locations, and the results show that the strain value is out of spec. Finally, some idle probes under BGA in FCT is suggested to be the root cause to trigger solder crack initiation, and both cross section and Dye & Pry result proves that the BGA crack issue can be solved after removing those probes. © 2011 IEEE.

84863258214	Study on rapid thermal cycling by inducted heating for microstructure of single SnAgCu solder joint	This paper reports in detail the experimental investigation of the effect of rapid thermal cycling on microstructure and growth of the intermetallic compound (IMC) layer at the interface between Sn3•0Ag-0•5Cu solder and Cu substrate. With the application of electromagnetic induced heating, the specimen was rapidly heated and cooled based on a control system that employs a fuzzy logic algorithm. The temperature distribution in the solder joint was simulated and analysed. The experimental results showed that the predicted temperature profile approximates the results of measurement. It was found that the rapid thermal cycling had an evident influence on the microstructure of a single solder joint. The thickness of the IMC layer grew gradually with the cycling temperature during the test period. In addition, heterogeneous coarsening occurred between the IMC and Cu substrate. The growth characteristics of the IMC layer showed a sawtooth-like profile along the subplate's sides from 60 to 200°C. © 2012 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

0037674863	Impact properties of flip chip interconnection using anisotropically conductive film on the glass and flexible substrate	Recently, Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF) has been attracted much interest because of ultra-fine and environmental compatibility. However, this new technology still has many limitations. Poor impact performance is the most critical limitation which not only threaten to the mechanical connection of the chop to the substrate but also make contact resistance very much unstable during vibration loading. This paper reports on the studies of the dynamic strength of flip-chip on glass (COG) and flip-chip on flexible substrate (COF) using ACF. Impact test were performed to investigate the key factors that affect the adhesion strength. The fractography characteristics were evaluated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). At first, impact strength increases with the bonding temperature, but after certain temperature, impact strength again decreases. Although bonding pressure doesn't influence the impact strength, it is still important for a good adhesion. The behaviors of the conductive particles and air bubbles also weaken the adhesion severely. From the detailed fracture mode study, it was found that impact load causes fracture to propagate in the ACF/substrate interface (for COG packages), and in the ACF matrix (for COF packages). It is proposed that the bonding temperature which actually determine the degree of curing of the ACF for a fixed process flow, should be precisely optimized. Over curing at higher bonding temperature deteriorate the impact performance of the ACF joints.

84866861319	Influence of IMCs volume ratio in micro-scale solder joints on their mechanical integrity	Since miniaturization of electronic devices makes the joint height of solder joints shrink to tens of microns. IMCs take noticeably high volume ratio in solder joints, which seldom happens in BGA or bulk solder joints. Growth of IMCs volume ratio will definitely affect mechanical integrities of micro-scale solder joints, which is rarely covered in pervious publications. In this paper, copper/SAC305/copper solder joints with a joint height of 20μm were utilized as specimens. They were aged at 150°C for different durations to obtain different thickness of IMCs. Microstructure of specimens was studied before tensile tests. The growth of IMCs and aging time follows parabolic law, similar to reported results. Tensile tests were carried out to investigate the effect of IMCs volume ratio on tensile strength and fracture mode. Fracture surface of some selected specimens after tests was observed to determine their dominant fracture modes. When specimens were aged for 1 hour, a significant decrease in tensile strength was observed which is due to the Ag

Ordinarily, in order to eliminate the impact of light source fluctuation, the inner surface of integrating sphere is selected as reference in the design of integrating sphere system. This design ensures the temporal stability of measurement. But the reflected light of inner surface and diffuse reflection light of sample are both detected as reference signal. It greatly impacts repeatability and error of indication. This paper improves d/0 measuring condition configuration with LEDs light source, and finds the method to reduce the error considering light source and integrating sphere. Then this paper simulates the configuration and establishes experiment for it.

84875416696	Dimensional change in micro-scale solder joint induced by evolution of IMCs	Dimensional stability is critically important to various applications for which the functions are sensitive to dimensional change and internal strain. Due to the variation of densities of materials in solder, pad metal and formed IMCs, the total volume and dimensions of solder joint could varies with time of aging or service. This paper theoretically analyzed the change in volume of tin/copper solder joints and proposed the relationship between growth of IMCs volume and volume change of solder joints, ΔVtotal=-0.0544ΔVCu6Sn5- ΔVCu3Sn(0.0827-0.0367x), indicating that growth of IMCs could lead to volume shrinkage due to aging. Based on two assumptions, the relationship between the growth of IMCs thickness and decrease in joint height is also given as Δhtotal=-0.0544ΔhCu6Sn5-ΔhCu3Sn(0.0827-0.0367x). Experiments to measure the change in joint height were conducted utilizing tin film/copper substrate diffusion couple in order to validate the model. The specimens with solder joints were prepared and aged at 150°C for different time; as such the height was measured every week. Experimentally, the decrease of height at an mean value of 0.873 μm was found after aged for 1 week, which is higher than theoretical value, which is attributed to three possible reasons. © 2012 IEEE.

Lead-free solder interconnection is one important technology for 3D-TSV stacked packaging. In order to deal with rising TSV density, solder joint volume is getting smaller. In the present paper, a high-density Sn micro-bump arrays for 30×30μm pitch were fabricated by photolithography, electroplating and reflow. The diameter and height of obtained Sn micro bumps are about 10μm and 8μm, respectively. It is found that the bulk of the micron bumps contains only one Sn grain due to the volume constraint. Also, the microstructural evolution of these single Sn grain microbumps under isothermal aging was investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM). © 2012 IEEE.

84875447637	An improved mean filter algorithm based on gray-scale difference and its application in X-ray detection system	In X-ray detection system, the image may be noised by the interference of various factors such as X-ray scattering, quantum fluctuation etc. For the purpose of not affecting the judgment of defects, it is necessary to remove noise from the image, meanwhile to keep the image edges as clear as before denoising. To achieve this goal, this paper proposed a new method of mean filter algorithm based on gray scale difference. The basic theory is that: Set a threshold value; calculate the absolute value of gray level differences between neighboring pixels and the center pixel. If the absolute value is larger than the threshold, set the weight of the corresponding neighboring pixel to 0. Otherwise set the weight of the pixel to the difference of the threshold and the absolute value. By denoising the image in actual production, this method showed good performance in noise reduction and keeping the image edges clear. © 2012 IEEE.

84878501084	Study of intermetallic growth and kinetics in fine-pitch lead-free solder bumps for next-generation flip-chip assemblies	With continued advances in microelectronics, it is anticipated that next-generation microelectronic assemblies will require a reduction of the flip-chip solder bump pitch to 100 μm or less from the current industrial practice of 130 μm to 150 μm. With this reduction in pitch size, and thus in bump height and diameter, the interaction between die pad metallurgy and substrate pad metallurgy becomes more critical due to the shorter diffusion path and greater stress. Existing literature has not addressed such metallurgical interaction in actual fine-pitch flip-chip assemblies. This work studies intermetallic growth and kinetics in fine-pitch lead-free solder bumps through thermal aging of flip-chip assemblies. Based on this study, it is seen that Ni from the die pad diffuses to the substrate pad region and Cu from the substrate pad diffuses to the die pad region, thus the resulting intermetallic compounds at the die and substrate pad regions are influenced by the other pad as well. Such cross-pad interaction is much stronger in fine-pitch solder bumps with smaller standoff height. It is seen that the die pad region contains Ni

The experiments show that low standoff height of solder joints and high thermomechanical stress play a great role in the interfacial IMC microstructure evolution under thermal shock, and strong cross-reaction of pad metallurgies is evident in the intermetallic growth. Furthermore, by comparing the IMC growth during thermal aging and thermal shock, it was found that thermal shock accelerates IMC growth and that kinetic models based on thermal aging experiments underpredict IMC growth in thermal shock experiments. Therefore, new diffusion kinetic parameters were determined for the growth of (Cu,Ni)

The study mainly focused on the size effect of solder joints on the microstructure of IMC. The experiments showed that lower stand-off height of solder joint and higher thermo-mechanical stress played a greater role on the IMC microstructure evolution for the smaller size solder joint under thermal shock test.

84891318964	Numerical calculation of the accuracy of approximate analysis methods for binary rectangular groove diffraction phase grating	The range of the accuracy of scalar diffraction theory and effective medium theory for binary rectangular groove phase grating is evaluated by the comparison of diffraction efficiencies predicted from scalar theory and effective medium theory, respectively, to exact vector results calculated by Fourier modal method. The effect of element parameters (depth, period, index of refraction, angle of incidence, and fill factor) on the accuracy of scalar treatment and effective medium theory is quantitatively determined. Generally, it is found that the scalar method is valid when the normalized period is more than fourfold wavelength of incident light at normal incidence. The error of transmittances between vector method and scalar method increases as the incident angle and refractive index increase. Furthermore, when the higher diffraction orders other than zero-th order are not to propagate, the effective medium theory is accurate to evaluate the transmittance of grating at normal incidence. The error of transmittances between effective medium method and rigorous vector theory increases as the incident angle and refractive index increase. Also, the error of diffraction efficiencies between the simple methods and the vector method on the polarization state of incident light is clearly demonstrated. © 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

This study provides some prospectives into the microstructural changes of the solder joints interconnection by rapid thermal cycles. The goal of this paper is to investigate the thermal fatigue behavior of a single Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC) lead-free and 63Sn-37Pb (SnPb) lead-containing solder joint treated by rapidly alternating heating and cooling cycles. The microstructure and morphology of the interface between the solder ball and Cu substrate was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The intermetallic compounds (IMC) and the solder bump surface were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and respectively. The experimental results showed that rapid thermal cycling had an evident influence on the interfacial microstructure of a single solder joint. The experiment revealed that microcracks initiate at the bottom of the SAC solder joint. In addition, rimous cracks initiated and propagated on the superficial oxide of the solder bump after rapid thermal cycling. The temperature distribution can be explained by finite element modeling (FEM) according to heat deformation theory in materials physics and based on metal thermal fatigue mechanism. © 2013 IEEE.

The morphology of the laser-drilled micro-holes was observed to optimize laser parameters. The WVP and slit tear resistance of the laser-drilled leather were measured. Results show that the optimized pulse energy for the 1064, 532 and 355 nm lasers are 0.8, 1.1 and 0.26 mJ, respectively. The diameters of the micro-holes drilled with the optimized laser pulse energy were about 20, 15 and 10 μm, respectively. The depths of the micro-holes drilled with the optimized pulse energy were about 21, 60 and 69 μm, respectively. Compared with the untreated samples, the highest WVP growth ratio was 38.4%, 46.8% and 53.5% achieved by the 1064, 532 and 355 nm lasers, respectively. And the highest decreasing ratio of slit tear resistance was 11.1%, 14.8%, and 22.5% treated by the 1064, 532 and 355 nm lasers, respectively. Analysis of the interaction mechanism between laser beams at three kinds of laser wavelengths and the PU synthetic leather revealed that laser micro-drilling at 355 nm wavelength displayed both photochemical ablation and photothermal ablation, while laser micro-drilling at 1064 and 532 nm wavelengths leaded to photothermal ablation only. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

LED display are developing in the direction of the high resolution, high density, small pixel pitch, intelligent. So the demand for the LED display screen manufacturing technology, especially the LED display module package is higher and higher, the pixel pitch of current LED display are below 2.5 mm(P2.5), some can reach P2, P1.5, P1.0 and even less. However, the current LED display with high definition and small pixel pitch used reflow soldering to mount surface mounted device three-in-one onto the printed circuit board. It's mature and widely used to manufacture LED display by this way, but there are many problems by using these discrete LED components to manufacture the LED display of high density, such as the poor reliability, the bad yield and the heat dissipation problem.

0942299008	Dynamic strength of anisotropic conductive joints in flip chip on glass and flip chip on flex packages	The work presented in this paper focuses on the behavior of anisotropically conductive film (ACF) joint under the dynamic loading of flip chip on glass (COG) and flip chip on flexible (COF) substrate packages. Impact tests were performed to investigate the key factors that affect the adhesion strength. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate the fractography characteristics of the fracture. Impact strength increased with the bonding temperature, but after a certain temperature, it decreased. Good absorption and higher degree of curing at higher bonding temperature accounts for the increase of the adhesion strength, while too high temperature causes overcuring of ACF and degradation at ACF/substrate interface - thus decreases the adhesion strength. Higher extent of air bubbles was found at the ACF/substrate interface of the sample bonded at the higher temperature. These air bubbles reduce the actual contact area and hence reduce the impact strength. Although bonding pressure was not found to influence the impact strength significantly, it is still important for a reliable electrical interconnect. The behaviors of the conductive particles during impact loading were also studied. From the fracture mode study, it was found that impact load caused fracture to propagate in the ACF/substrate interface (for COG packages), and in the ACF matrix (for COF packages). Because of weak interaction of the ACF with the glass, COG showed poor impact adhesion. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
