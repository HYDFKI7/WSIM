18744408454	Nitroester drug's effects and their antagonistic effects against morphine on human sphincter of Oddi motility	Aim: To evaluate the effects of nitroester drugs on human sphincter of Oddi (SO) motility and their antagonistic effects against morphine which shows excitatory effect on Oddi's sphincter motility. Methods: The effects of these drugs on SO were evaluated by means of choledochofiberoscopy manometry. A total of 67 patients having T-tubes after cholecystectomy and choledochotomy were involved in the study, they were randomly divided into glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) group, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) group, pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PTN) group, morphine associated with GTN group, morphine associated with ISDN group and morphine associated with PTN group. Basal pressure of Oddi's sphincter (BPOS), amplitude of phasic contractions (SOCA), frequency of phasic contractions (SOF), duration of phasic contractions (SOD), duodenal pressure (DP) and common bile duct pressure (CBDP) were scored and analyzed. Morphine was given intramuscularly while nitroester drugs were applied sublingually. Results: BPOS and SOCA decreased significantly after administration of ISDN and GTN, BPOS reduced from 10.95±7.49 mmHg to 5.92±4.04 mmHg (P<0.05) evidently after application of PTN. BPOS increased from 7.37±5.58 mmHg to 16.60±13.87 mmHg, SOCA increased from 54.09±38.37 mmHg to 100.70±43.51 mmHg, SOF increased from 7.15±3.20 mmHg to 10.38±2.93 mmHg and CBDP increased 3.75±1.95 mmHg to 10.49±8.21 mmHg (P<0.01) evidently after injection of morphine. After associated application of ISDN and GTN, the four indications above decreased obviously. As for application associated with PTN, SOCA and SOF decreased separately from 100.64±44.99 mmHg to 66.17±35.88 mmHg and from 10.70±2.76 mmHg to 9.04±1.71 mmHg (P<0.05) markedly. Conclusion: The regular dose of GTN, ISDN and PTN showed inhibitory effect on SO motility, morphine showed excitatory effect on SO while GTN, ISDN and PTN could antagonize the effect of morphine. Among the three nitroester drugs, the effect of ISDN on SO was most significant. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

20344381797	Effects of somatostatin analogues on human sphincter of Oddi pressure	Background: Somatostatin, a neuropeptide and hormone, exists in the biliary tract of several species. The effects of somatostatin and its analogues on the sphincter of Oddi motility have been controversial. The aim of this study was to observe the action of stilamin and sandostatin on the sphincter of Oddi via choledochofiberscope manometry. Methods: Twenty patients who had had "T" duct after cholecystectomy and choledochotomy were divided into 2 groups randomly: stilamin and sandostatin. They were subjected to manometry via a choledochofiberscope through the 'T' duct tract. The following data recorded included duodenal pressure (DP), sphincter of Oddi basal pressure (SOBP), sphincter of Oddi contractive amplitude (SOCA), frequency of the sphincter of Oddi (SOF), duration of the sphincter of Oddi, and the common bile duct pressure (CBDP). Results: After intravenous administration of stilamin at a dose of 250 μg/h, the mean SOCA increased from 89.18 (26.50) to 128.57(54.21) mmHg (P<0.05). After the administration of stilamin at a dose of 500 μg /h the mean SOCA declined to 92.18(42.81) mmHg (P<0.05), and mean SOBP declined from 17.63(13.36) to 8.16(4.01) mmHg (P<0.05). Although SOF had declined from 9.25(2.45) to 7.46(1.52) n/min, it was not significantly influenced. After intravenous administration of sandostatin at a dose of 100 μg, the mean CBDP increased obviously. Conclusions: Intravenous administration of stilamin at a dose of 250 μg/h stimulates the motility of the sphincter of Oddi whereas the injection of stilamin at a dose of 500 μg/h inhibits its motility. Intravenous injection of sandostatin of 100 μg has no effect on the sphincter of Oddi. © 2005, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int. All rights reserved.

Methods: 157 patients who had a T tube after cholecystectomy and choledochotomy were assessed by choledochoscope manometry. They were randomly divided into 5 groups. Sphincter of Oddi basal pressure (SOBP), amplitude (SOCA), frequency of contractions (SOF), duration of contractions (SOD), duodenal pressure (DP), common bile duct pressure (CBDP) were scored and analyzed. Results: SOBP, SOCA and SOF increased after injection of morphine and Ap-237, CBDP increased after intramuscular administered morphine. No apparent change occurred after intramuscularly administered pethidine. SOBP and SOCA decreased after tramadol. After intravenous administration of stilamin in a dose of 250 μg/h, SOCA increased. After administration stilamin of 500 μg/h dose, SOCA and SOBP declined. After intravenous administration of sandostatin, CBDP increased obviously. BPOS and SOCA decreased significantly after administration of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), SOBP reduced evidently after application of pentaerithrityl tetranitrate (PTN). SOBP, SOCA, SOF and CBDP increased evidently after injection of morphine. After associated application of ISDN and GTN, the four indications above decreased. As to associated application with PTN, SOCA and SOF decreased. After associated application of anisodamine or atropine, SOCA, SOBP declined, after injected buscopan, SOCA, SOBP, SOF all declined. Conclusion: The regular dose of morphine and Ap-237 shows excitatory effect on the sphincter of Oddi motility. Tramadol shows inhibitory effect on the sphincter of Oddi. The regular dose of pethidine and sandostatin shows no apparent effect on the sphincter of Oddi. Stilamin in low dose shows excitated effect on the sphincter of Oddi. Nitroester drugs show inhibited effects on SO motility. Nitroester drugs and anticholinergic agents can antagonize the excitated effect of morphine.

33745967289	Choledochoscopic manometry research of the sphincter of Oddi motility in bile duct stone patients with a T tube after operation	AIM: To study the sphincter of Oddi (SO) motility by choledochoscopic manometry, and to investigate the manometric appearance of sphincter of Oddi disorders and its relationship with bile duct stones. METHODS: Two hundred and sixteet patients who had a T tube after operation were assessed by choledochoscopic manometry. SO basal pressure (SOBP), amplitude of SO contractions (SOCA), frequency of SO contractions (SOCF), duration of SO contractions (SOCD), duodenal pressure (DP), common bile duct pressure (CBDP), and the percentage of propagate directions were scored and analyzed. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to the levels of sphincter of Oddi basal pressure: group A (sphincter of Oddi hypomotility), group B (normal SOPB), group C (SOBP a little higher than normal) and group D (sphincter of Oddi dysfunction). RESULTS: The mean SOCA in group A was 62.32 ± 32.13 mmHg, much lower than that in the other three groups (P < 0.01); the mean SOCD in group A was shorter than that in group B and group C (P < 0.01); the mean SOCF in group A had no significant difference from that in group B and group C, but lower than that in group D (P < 0.05); the mean CBDP in group A was 3.89 ± 8.10 mmHg, much lower than that in group D (P < 0.01), but higher than SOBP. The SOCA in group D was 97.02 ± 51.76 mmHg, apparently higher than that in group A (P < 0.01), which was not significantly different from that in group B and group C, but with a tendency to increase; the mean SOCD in group D was shorter than that in group C (P < 0.05), and there was no apparent difference between the other two groups; the mean SOCF in group D was markedly higher than that in the other three groups (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05); the mean CBDP in group D was 10.41 ± 12.37 mmHg, higher than that in group A and B (P < 0.01), but was not statistically different from that in group C; the percentage of retrograde peristalsis in group D (35.73% ± 26.38%) was notably higher than that in group A (20.31% ± 21.96%) and B (22.71% ± 23.86%)(P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SO dysfunction and hypomotility exist in bile duct stone patients after operation, which can be diagnosed effectively by choledochoscopic manometry. The SO disorders may be associated with the formation or/and recurrence of bile duct stones.

33747634065	Role of detection of microsatellite instability in Chinese with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or ordinary hereditary colorectal cancer	Aim: To detect microsatellite instability (MSI) in patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or ordinary hereditary colorectal cancer and to provide criteria for screening the kindreds with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer at molecular level. Methods: MSI was detected in the specimens from 20 cases with HNPCC, 20 cases with ordinary hereditary colorectal cancer and 20 cases with sporadic colorectal cancer by means of polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism. Results: The positive rate of MSI was 85% (17/20) in HNPCC group, 40% (8/20) in ordinary hereditary colorectal cancer group and 10% (2/20) in the sporadic colorectal cancer group respectively. The differences were significant. The mean ages of the three groups were 43.6, 52.2, and 61.8 years respectively, which increased gradually. The incidence of right hemicolon cancer was 64.7%, 37.5%, and 0% respectively, which decreased gradually and had significant difference. The expression ratio of BAT26 and BAT25 was 94.1% respectively, which was highest in the 5 gene sites studied. The incidence of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma was 70.6% in HNPCC group among high frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H), which was higher than the other two groups, which had 50% and 50% respectively. Conclusion: The incidence of MSI-H is higher in HNPCC group. The detection of MSI is simple and economical and has high correlation with the clinicopathologic feature of HNPCC and can be used as a screening method to detect the germ line mutation of the mismatch repair gene. © 2006 The WJG Press.

33748423978	Development of a chemiluminescent ELISA for determining chloramphenicol in chicken muscle	An indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with chemiluminescent (CL) detection for chloramphenicol (CAP) in chicken muscle was developed. CAP-specific polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbit with a CAP-succinate derivative conjugated with bovine serum albumin. Luminol solution was used as the substrate of horseradish peroxidase. The detection limit was 6 ng/L. The CL-ELISA was 10 times more sensitive compared to the colorimetric-ELISA. When CAP was spiked in chicken muscle at levels of 0.05-5 μg/kg, recoveries ranged from 97 to 118% with coefficients of variation of 6-22%. In an actual residue study, the results obtained by CL-ELISA correlated well with those obtained by gas chromatography with microcell electron capture detector. The residue levels of CAP in treated chicken decreased with time and dropped rapidly after the first 6 h from around 50 to 10 μg/kg. After 3 days, CAP was not detected in chicken muscle. The developed method is therefore suitable for screening of CAP in chicken muscle samples. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

33847757454	Relationship between endemic diseases and environmental geochemistry in the Yarlung Zangbo Great Canyon area	In the Yarlung Zangbo Great Canyon area, endemic and massive diseases of skeletal growth and development seriously affect the health of the residents and economic and social development. China Geology Survey has carried out regional geochemical survey of the Bomi and Mêdog sheets in the interior of the Yarlung Zangbo Great Canyon. The results indicate the following environmental geochemical characteristics: the vital elements Fe, P, Ca, Mg, Mn, Co and Zn are lower than their average values of stream sediments in China; the elements Cu, Mo, Cr, V and Ni are much lower. Toxicity elements Ba, Be, Sr, Li are on the high side. U Th are much higher; the poisonous elements Ba, Be, Sr and Li are higher; U and Th are noticeably higher and P/F, Sr/CaO and Ba/CaO are disproportional. The occurrence of endemic diseases is closely related to the inferior environmental geochemical quality. Research also shows that large-scale material exchange and special geochemical landscapes resulting from plate movement in the great canyon area are the deep-seated causes for the inferior quality of the geochemical environment and occurrence of endemic diseases in the Yarlung Zangbo Great Canyon.

34250312376	Relationship between intraduodenal peri-amplullary diverticulum and biliary disease in 178 patients undergoing ERCP	Background: The presence of intraduodenal peri-ampullary diverticulum is often observed during upper digestive tract barium meal studies and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). A few papers in China and overseas reported that the diverticulum had something to do with the incidence of cholelithiasis. This study was undertaken to further test this notion and ascertain the relationship between intraduodenal peri-ampullary diverticulum and biliary disease, especially the formation of bile duct pigment stones. Methods: A total of 178 patients who had undergone ERCP or endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) were studied retrospectively. They were divided into 6 groups according to the category of biliary disease, and the incidence rates of intraduodenal peri-ampullary diverticulum were calculated. Results: There were 44 patients with intraduodenal peri-ampullary diverticulum in 81 patients with primary bile duct pigment stones (54.32%), 4 in 8 patients with bile duct stones and gallbladder stones (50%), 7 in 33 patients with bile duct stones secondary to gallbladder stones (21.21%), 3 in 21 patients with inflammation and stricture of the end of the bile duct and papilla (14.29%), 1 in 22 patients with carcinoma of the end of the bile duct and papilla (4.54%), and 5 in 13 patients with post-cholecystectomy syndrome or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (38.46%). Conclusions: The incidence rate of intraduodenal peri-ampullary diverticulum in patients with primary bile duct pigment stones is higher than that in patients with bile duct stones secondary to gallbladder stones, patients with inflammation and stricture of the end of the bile duct and papilla, and patients with carcinoma of the end of the bile duct and papilla. These findings indicate that the anatomical abnormalities and malfunction of the sphincter of Oddi play an important role in the formation of bile duct pigment stones. © 2007, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

39049121634	Differences and significance of motilin, vasoactive intestinal peptide and gastrin in blood and gallbladder tissues of patients with gallstones	Background: The disorders of gallbladder motility may play an important role in the formation of gallstones. Many neural and hormonal factors and their interactions regulate gallbladder motility and bile flow into the duodenum. Further study in these factors may help to reveal the etiology of gallbladder diseases. This study was undertaken to assess the relationship of the levels of motilin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and gastrin in blood and gallbladder tissues with the formation of cholelithiasis. Methods: The levels of motilin, gastrin and VIP in blood and gallbladder tissues of 36 patients with gallbladder stones, 14 patients with gallbladder polyps, 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with common bile duct stones were measured by radioimmunoassay. Results: The level of motilin in plasma and gallbladder tissues of the gallbladder stone group was higher than that of the control and gallbladder polyp groups (P<0.05). The levels of plasma VIP and serum gastrin were much higher than those of the other three groups (P<0.01). The level of VIP in gallbladder tissues was higher than that of the control and gallbladder polyp groups (P<0.01). Conclusions: The abnormal excretion of hormonal factors is closely related to gallstone formation. The high level of VIP in gallbladder tissues may be an important cause of gallbladder hypomotility. The abnormal level of serum gastrin may be related to the gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with gallstones. © 2008, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int. All rights reserved.

34247585186	Direct CP violation in B̄0→ρ0(ω)ρ0(ω) →π+π-π+π-	We study the direct CP violation in B̄0→ρ0(ω) ρ0(ω)→π+π-π+π- [with unpolarized ρ0(ω)] via the ρ-ω mixing mechanism which causes a large strong phase difference and consequently a large CP violating asymmetry when the masses of the π+π- pairs are in the vicinity of the ω resonance. Since there are two ρ(ω) mesons in the intermediate state ρ-ω mixing contributes twice to the first order of isospin violation, leading to an even larger CP violating asymmetry (it could be 30%-50% larger) than in the case where only one ρ(ω) meson is involved. The CP violating asymmetry depends on the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements and the hadronic matrix elements. The factorization approach is applied in the calculation of the hadronic matrix elements with the nonfactorizable effects being included effectively in an effective parameter, Nc. We give the constraint on the range of Nc from the latest experimental data for the branching ratios for B̄0→ρ0ρ0 and B̄0→ρ+ρ-. We find that the CP violating asymmetry could be very large (even more than 90% for some values of Nc). It is shown that the sensitivity of the CP violating asymmetry to Nc is large compared with its smaller sensitivity to the CKM matrix elements. We also discuss the possibility to remove the mod (π) ambiguity in the determination of the CP violating phase angle α through the measurement of the CP violating asymmetry in the decay B̄0→ρ0(ω)ρ0(ω) →π+π-π+π-. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The panoramic unwrapping and correcting algorithm, up to a full 360°, based on coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) and night vision image enhancement algorithm, based on histogram equalization theory and edge detection theory, was presented in this paper, with the purpose of processing night vision dynamic panoramic annular image. The annular image can be unwrapped and corrected to conventional rectangular panorama by the panoramic image processing algorithm, which uses the pipelined CORDIC configuration to realize a trigonometric function generator with high speed and high precision. Histogram equalization algorithm can perfectly enhance the contrast of the night vision image. Edge detection algorithm can be propitious to find and detect small dim dynamic targets in night vision circumstances. After abundant experiment, the algorithm for panoramic image processing and night vision image enhancement is successfully implemented in FPGA and DSP. The panoramic night vision image system is a compact device, with no external rotating parts. And the system can reliably and dynamically detect 360° SLVF panoramic night vision image.

The charged-hadron yield is obtained by counting the number of reconstructed hits, hit pairs, and fully reconstructed charged-particle tracks. The combination of the three methods gives a charged-particle multiplicity per unit of pseudorapidity dNch/ dη|η|<0.5 = 5.78 ± 0.01(stat)±0.23(syst) for non-single-diffractive events, higher than predicted by commonly used models. The relative increase in charged-particle multiplicity from √s=0.9 to 7 TeV is [66.1±1.0(stat)±4.2(syst)]%. The mean transverse momentum is measured to be 0.545±0.005(stat)±0.015(syst)GeV/c.

Here, we introduce agriGO, an integrated web-based GO analysis toolkit for the agricultural community, using the advantages of our previous GO enrichment tool (EasyGO), to meet analysis demands from new technologies and research objectives. EasyGO is valuable for its proficiency, and has proved useful in uncovering biological knowledge in massive data sets from high-throughput experiments. For agriGO, the system architecture and website interface were redesigned to improve performance and accessibility. The supported organisms and gene identifiers were substantially expanded (including 38 agricultural species composed of 274 data types). The requirement on user input is more flexible, in that user-defined reference and annotation are accepted. Moreover, a new analysis approach using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis strategy and customizable features is provided. Four tools, SEA (Singular enrichment analysis), PAGE (Parametric Analysis of Gene set Enrichment), BLAST4ID (Transfer IDs by BLAST) and SEACOMPARE (Cross comparison of SEA), are integrated as a toolkit to meet different demands. We also provide a cross-comparison service so that different data sets can be compared and explored in a visualized way. Lastly, agriGO functions as a GO data repository with search and download functions; agriGO is publicly accessible at http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO/. © The Author(s) 2010.

77954301042	A new method for line spectra reduction of vibration isolation system based on flexible base	Line spectra in the radiated noise of marine vessels are the most visible signs, which can be detected, tracked and identified by enemy's passive sonar, and hence it is of great significance to reduce the line spectra for improving the acoustic stealth of marine vessels. Insertion of resilient isolators between the machinery and the base is one of the most common methods for controlling unwanted vibration of the hull of submarine. Isolators in service are usually assumed to be linear and almost all the vibration isolation-n systems (VIS) are designed with linear theory, which satisfies engineering requirements in most situations. However, the nonlinear dynamical characteristics of VIS have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to the facts that onboard machinery trends towards more powerful and lighter, and that the demands in engineering for reducing vibration become more rigorous. Furthermore, some distinguishing features of nonlinear systems can be applied to achieve some special functions, among which the most important one is using chaos to reduce line spectra in the radiated noise of submarines based on the fact that response spectrum of a nonlinear system under harmonic excitation is a continuous one when chaos occurs. In this paper, a chaos synthesis method based on tracking control is prososed for a vibration isolation system (VIS) of on board machinery to make the chaotic motion in nonlinear VIS persistent. In this way, the line spectra in the radiated noise can be reduced effectively because the response spectrum of a chaotic system under harmonic excitations is a continuous and reduced one. Numerical simulations were carried out and the results showed that utilizing this method the nonlinear VIS not only possesses an excellent isolation performance of vibration and line spectra, but also reduces the amplitude of the isolated equipment notably.

79952286667	Transcriptome phase distribution analysis reveals diurnal regulated biological processes and key pathways in rice flag leaves and seedling leaves	Plant diurnal oscillation is a 24-hour period based variation. The correlation between diurnal genes and biological pathways was widely revealed by microarray analysis in different species. Rice (Oryza sativa) is the major food staple for about half of the world's population. The rice flag leaf is essential in providing photosynthates to the grain filling. However, there is still no comprehensive view about the diurnal transcriptome for rice leaves. In this study, we applied rice microarray to monitor the rhythmically expressed genes in rice seedling and flag leaves. We developed a new computational analysis approach and identified 6,266 (10.96%) diurnal probe sets in seedling leaves, 13,773 (24.08%) diurnal probe sets in flag leaves. About 65% of overall transcription factors were identified as flag leaf preferred. In seedling leaves, the peak of phase distribution was from 2:00am to 4:00am, whereas in flag leaves, the peak was from 8:00pm to 2:00am. The diurnal phase distribution analysis of gene ontology (GO) and cis-element enrichment indicated that, some important processes were waken by the light, such as photosynthesis and abiotic stimulus, while some genes related to the nuclear and ribosome involved processes were active mostly during the switch time of light to dark. The starch and sucrose metabolism pathway genes also showed diurnal phase. We conducted comparison analysis between Arabidopsis and rice leaf transcriptome throughout the diurnal cycle. In summary, our analysis approach is feasible for relatively unbiased identification of diurnal transcripts, efficiently detecting some special periodic patterns with non-sinusoidal periodic patterns. Compared to the rice flag leaves, the gene transcription levels of seedling leaves were relatively limited to the diurnal rhythm. Our comprehensive microarray analysis of seedling and flag leaves of rice provided an overview of the rice diurnal transcriptome and indicated some diurnal regulated biological processes and key functional pathways in rice. © 2011 Xu et al.

84861752543	Preparation of tripterine nanostructured lipid carriers and their absorption in rat intestine	The purpose of this study was to develop an optimized nanostructured lipid carrier formulation (NLC) for tripterine, and to estimate the potential of NLCs as oral delivery system. Tripterine-loaded NLCs were prepared by the solvent evaporation method. The average drug entrapment efficiency, particle size and zeta potential of the optimized tripterine-loaded NLCs were 78.64 ± 0.37 %, 109.6 ± 5.8nm and -29.8 ± 1.3mV, respectively. The tripterine-loaded NLCs showed spherical morphology with smooth surface under the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The crystallization of drug in NLC was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The drug was in an amorphous state in the NLC matrix. According to the in vitro release study, the tripterine-loaded NLCs showed a delayed release profile of tripterine. The rat intestinal perfusion model was used to study the absorption of tripterine solution and tripterine-loaded NLCs. The Peff * (effective permeability) of tripterine-loaded NLCs in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon was approximately 2.1, 2.7, 1.1, 1.2-fold higher than that of tripterine solution, respectively. The 10%ABS (percent absorption of 10 cm of intestine) of tripterine-loaded NLCs in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon was approximately 2.2, 2.3, 1.2, 1.3-fold higher than that of tripterine solution, respectively. The intestinal toxicity of tripterine formulated in the NLCs was investigated and compared with the tripterine solution by the MTT assay with Caco-2 cell models. According to the result, the tripterine-loaded NLCs could greatly decrease the cytotoxicity of the drug. In conclusion, the NLC formulation remarkably improved the absorption of tripterine and showed a better biocompatibility.

84861678460	Multi-line spectra reduction of vibration isolation system based on chaotification method	Line spectra in the radiated noise of marine vessels are the most visible signals, which can be detected, tracked and identified by passive sonar of the enemy, and hence it is of great significance to reduce the line spectra for improving the acoustic stealth of marine vessels. The technology of chaos spectra reduction was used to reduce line spectra in the radiated noise of submarines based on the fact that response spectrum of a nonlinear system under harmonic excitation is a continuous one when chaos occurs. The feedback chaotification of the single-degree-of-freedom vibration system and multi-degree-of-freedom vibration systems subjected to harmonic excitation were analyzed, and the chaotification method of the multi-degree-of-freedom vibration system subjected to multi-frequency excitation was proposed. The study discovered the condition and approach that the vibration system enters the chaos state subjected controller effect, and overcome the difficulties that how to maintain the chaotic motion when the operation condition and the environment change. The experimental platform of the two-degree-of-freedom VIS for discretization and chaotification was designed, and the dynamics of the system with different feedback plus was experimentally studied. The results confirmed the effectiveness of this method, and can provide the theoretical and experimental bases of design for chaos VIS.

84867402736	Dual-functional liposomes based on pH-responsive cell-penetrating peptide and hyaluronic acid for tumor-targeted anticancer drug delivery	Dual-functional liposomes with pH-responsive cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) and active targeting hyaluronic acid (HA) were fabricated for tumor-targeted drug delivery. A series of synthetic tumor pH-triggered CPPs rich in arginines and histidines were screened by comparing tumor cellular uptake efficiency at pH 6.4 with at pH 7.4, and R6H4 (RRRRRRHHHH) was obtained with the optimal pH-response. To construct R6H4-modified liposomes (R6H4-L), stearyl R6H4 was anchored into liposomes due to hydrophobic interaction. HA was utilized to shield positive charge of R6H4-L to assemble HA-coated R6H4-L (HA-R6H4-L) by electrostatic effect for protecting the liposomes from the attack of plasma proteins. The rapid degradation of HA by hyaluronidase (HAase) was demonstrated by the viscosity and zeta potential detection, allowing the R6H4 exposure of HA-R6H4-L at HAase-rich tumor microenvironment as the protection by HA switches off and cell-penetrating ability of R6H4 turns on. After HAase treatment, paclitaxel-loaded HA-R6H4-L (PTX/HA-R6H4-L) presented a remarkably stronger cytotoxicity toward the hepatic cancer (HepG2) cells at pH 6.4 relative to at pH 7.4, and additionally coumarin 6-loaded HA-R6H4-L (C6/HA-R6H4-L) showed efficient intracellular trafficking including endosomal/lysosomal escape and cytoplasmic liberation by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In vivo imaging suggested the reduced accumulation of near infrared dye 15 (NIRD15)-loaded HA-R6H4-L (NIRD/HA-R6H4-L) at the tumor site, when mice were pre-treated with an excess of free HA, indicating the active tumor targeting of HA. Indeed, PTX/HA-R6H4-L had the strongest antitumor efficacy against murine hepatic carcinoma (Heps) tumor xenograft models in vivo. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using tumor pH-sensitive CPPs and active targeting HA to extend the applications of liposomal nanocarriers to efficient anticancer drug delivery. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Tripterine-loaded NLCs were prepared by solvent diffusion method. The concentrations of lipophilic and hydrophilic surfactants were optimized based on the size and the entrapment efficiency (EE) of the resulting NLC. An amorphous state in the NLC matrix and a spherical morphology were observed in the optimized tripterine-loaded NLCs by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The average drug entrapment efficiency(EE), particle size and zeta potential of the tripterine-loaded NLCs were determined by ultra filtration and laser particle size analyzer, which were (88.64±0.57) %, (132.3±25) nm and (-26.5±3.4) mV, respectively. Drug release profile of tripterine-loaded NLCs in vitro was in accordance with Ritger and Peppas equation (ln R = 0.6571 ln t-2.9074, r = 0.9951) with a delayed release of tripterine. Moreover, compared with tripterine solution, the tripterine-loaded NLCs improved drug deposition in the skin of rat significantly. Considering the cellular up taking rate, the concentrations of tripterine after incubated with NLCs was 1.6-fold increased compared with tripterine solution. The results of penetration experiment and cellular uptake indicated that NLCs could enhence the drug deposition. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the NLCs system is a promising carrier for topical delivery of tripterine with improved drug deposition into skin. © 2012 IEEE.

84876583613	N-octyl-N-Arginine chitosan micelles as an oral delivery system of insulin	N-octyl-N-Arginine chitosan (OACS) was synthesized in an attempt to combine the permeation enhancing effects of arginine-rich peptides and the drug loading capacity of the amphipathic polymers for insulin oral delivery. OACS selfassembled micelles of insulin were prepared by the conventional stirring technique, which were characterized by Dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Molecular docking by Discovery studio software confirmed that the interactions between OACS and insulin were mostly electrostatic in nature. In vitro, the result of the degradation experiment by enzyme showed that the OACS has a relative protective effect for insulin from proteolyses. Compared to the insulin solution, OACS micelles increased the Caco-2 cell's internalization by up to 22.3 folds. In vivo, the pharmacological activity PA% of series OACS-insulin micelles ranged from 7.7%~16.8%. Meanwhile by increasing arginine degree of the substitution both the uptake in Caco-2 cells and the hypoglycemic effect in diabetic rats were enhanced. Therefore, it is concluded that using arginine polymeric micelles for the enhancement of oral insulin delivery is a promising approach for the oral peptide delivery.

Methods: A total of 70 patients having T tubes after cholecystectomy and choledochotomy were assessed by choledochoscope manometry. They were randomly divided into morphine group, Ap-237 group, pethidine group and tramadol group. Basal pressure of Oddi's sphincter (BPOS), amplitude of phasic contractions (SOCA), frequency of phasic contractions (SOF), duration of phasic contractions (SOD), duodenal pressure (DP) and common bile duct pressure (CBDP) were scored and analyzed. All narcotic analgesic drugs were administered intramuscularly. Results: Levels of BPOS, SOCA and SOF were increased after injection of morphine and Ap-237 (P<0.05), level of CBDP was increased from 4.97±3.87 mmHg to 8.62±7.43 mmHg (10 min later) and 7.32±5.95 mmHg (20 min later) after injection of morphine (P< 0.01). No apparent change occurred after intramuscular injection of pethidine. Level of BPOS was increased from 7.01±5.50 mmHg to 2.87±2.78 mmHg 10 min after injection of tramadol and SOCA was decreased from 63.34±35.29 mmHg to 45.90±27.86 mmHg (10 min later,P<0.05) and 35.97±24.30 (20 min later,P<0.01) after administration of tramadol. Conclusion: All these findings indicate that Oddi's sphincter manometry via choledochoscope is a practical and new way to study the dynamics of Oddi' s sphincter. The regular dose of morphine and Ap-237 could increase BPOS, SOF and SOCA. Morphine could increase the level of CBDP, demonstrating an excitatory effect on the sphincter of Oddi. Pethidine had no effect on Oddi's sphincter motility. Tramadol shows an inhibitory effect on the motility of the sphincter of Oddi and decreases levels of BPOS and SOCA.

Finally to if there is close relationship among sphincter of Oddi hypomotility, duodenal-biliary reflux and gastrointestinal peptides. Methods: Forty-five patients with a T tube after cholecystectomy and choledochotomy were divided into reflux group and control group. The level of plasma and serum gastrin of the patients and of 12 healthy volunteers were measured by radioimmunoassay. Thirty-four were selected randomly to undergo choledochoscope manometry. Sphincter of Oddi basal pressure (SOBP), amplitude (SOCA), frequency of contractions (SOF), duration of contractions (SOD), duodenal pressure (DP) and common bile duct pressure (CBDP) were scored and analyzed. Results: Sixteen (35.6%) patients were detected to have duodenal-biliary reflux. SOBP, SOCA and CBDP in the reflux group were much lower than the control group (t = 5.254, 3.438 and 3.527, P < 0.001). SOD of the reflux group was shorter than the control group (t = 2.049, P < 0.05). The level of serum gastrin and plasma motilin of the reflux group was much lower than the control group (t = -2.230 and -2.235, P < 0.05). There was positive correlation between the level of plasma motilin and SOBP and between the level of serum gastrin and SOBP and CBDP. Conclusion: About 35.9% of the patients with a T tube after cholecystectomy and choledochotomy have duodenal-biliary reflux. Most of them have sphincter of Oddi hypomotility and the decreased level of plasma motilin and serum gastrin.

69049114010	The preliminary experimental and clinical study of the relationship between the pigment gallstone and intestinal mucosal barrier	Aims: To investigate the relations between the formation of pigment gallstone and the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier, as well as the underlying mechanism. Methods: Eighty guinea pigs were randomly divided into three groups in which they were respectively given normal diet, gallstone-causing diet, and gallstone-formation diet with a supplementary intestinal mucosal protection compound known as glutamine. The model of pigment gallstone was established after 8 weeks of dietary administration. Indices about the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier and bacterial translocation were measured. Clinical cases were divided into three groups: control, cholesterol gallstone, and pigment gallstone, where the levels of plasma diamine oxidase (DAO), plasma endotoxin and the excretion rates of technetium 99m-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (99mTC-DTPA) in the urine of each group were measured. Results: In the pigment gallstone group, the level of plasma DAO and endotoxin, the excretory ratio of lactulose and mannitol in urine, the bacterial translocation ratio in the celiac lymph nodes and the activities of β-glucuronidase increased comparing to the control group. The gallstone-formation rate for the intestinal mucosal protection group (GLN) decreased, and other indices, except the activity of β-glucuronidase, were all lower than that of gallstone-formation group. In the clinical experiment, the levels of plasma DAO and endotoxin, as well as the excretory rate of 99mTC-DTPA in urine were higher in the patients with gallstones than that in the control group. Conclusions: The formation of pigment gallstone was related to the abnormal function of the intestinal mucosal barrier. The abnormality in the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier probably induced the formation of gallstone by a bacterial translocation mechanism. © 2009 The Authors.

74049136120	Distribution of residual stress along depth under different shot peening technoloties	The residual stresses engendered by 16 different shot peening technologies were researched and analyzed systemically by using x-ray method in this paper. For each shot peening work-piece, 4 different test points were chosen and 8 different depths 0~250μm under the surface for each point were tested by step-by-step electrolytic polishing method. And then the equations of polishing electric current, depth and time were figured out by experimental demarcation using self-making fixture, which solved the problem that data obtained and measured accurately at 25μm depth, and got the residual stress distribution of these 16 technologies. It was shown that the max residual compress stress of home made shot peening was at the depth of 50μm under the surface and the influence layer was 150μm depth, while 50~75μm and 200μm respectively for the import one. The rotating speed of throwing wheel is proportional to the A1 value, and the max residual stress increased slightly along with Al value but no quantity relationship between them. The depth of residual stress influence layer after shot peening has directly relation with shot character, but rotating speed.

75549083571	PMRD: Plant microRNA database	MicroRNAs (miRNA) are ̃21 nucleotide-long non-coding small RNAs, which function as post-transcriptional regulators in eukaryotes. miRNAs play essential roles in regulating plant growth and development. In recent years, research into the mechanism and consequences of miRNA action has made great progress. With whole genome sequence available in such plants as Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Populus trichocarpa, Glycine max, etc., it is desirable to develop a plant miRNA database through the integration of large amounts of information about publicly deposited miRNA data. The plant miRNA database (PMRD) integrates available plant miRNA data deposited in public databases, gleaned from the recent literature, and data generated in-house. This database contains sequence information, secondary structure, target genes, expression profiles and a genome browser. In total, there are 8433 miRNAs collected from 121 plant species in PMRD, including model plants and major crops such as Arabidopsis, rice, wheat, soybean, maize, sorghum, barley, etc. For Arabidopsis, rice, poplar, soybean, cotton, medicago and maize, we included the possible target genes for each miRNA with a predicted interaction site in the database. Furthermore, we provided miRNA expression profiles in the PMRD, including our local rice oxidative stress related microarray data (LC Sciences miRPlants_10.1) and the recently published microarray data for poplar, Arabidopsis, tomato, maize and rice. The PMRD database was constructed by open source technology utilizing a user-friendly web interface, and multiple search tools. The PMRD is freely available at http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/PMRD. We expect PMRD to be a useful tool for scientists in the miRNA field in order to study the function of miRNAs and their target genes, especially in model plants and major crops. © The Author(s) 2009.

77949611636	RS-tree: A dynamic index structure	R-tree and its variants didn't consider the relation between index records included in leaf nodes and storage locations in which index records are stored. Because of this reason, an index structure was designated as RS-tree in this paper. In RS-tree the index records of sequential storage locations in database files are distributed to the same leaf node or sequential leaf nodes, and the sequence of nodes of non-leaf layer is kept the same as the one of nodes of their children's layer, which leads to the reduction of consuming time effectively that the database system spends in searching records during query. We have taken a series of experiments on a data set which consisted of 2219803 records. The experimental results show that during querying successively more than 1000 records test RS-tree's speed is nearly 500 times faster than R-tree's. ©2009 IEEE.

77950794336	Changes of agroecosystem services value under effects of land consolidation	This paper quantitatively described the changes of agroecosystem functions before (2003) and after (2007) the implementation of Gaolong land consolidation project in Hechuan of Chongqing. Engineering design and shadow price were integrated to quantify the effects of the project on the functions, and cost-benefit analysis was used to further explain the economic meanings of the functions, and to analyze the changes of the agroecosystem services value under effects of the project. Compared with that before the land consolidation, the agroecosystem services value after the land consolidation was somewhat improved, with the largest increment of nutrient cycling function and the smallest change of soil conservation function. In the implementation of the project, the changes of the agroecosystem services value induced by farmland water conservancy, field road building, and land-leveling engineering mainly manifested in the change of disturbance function. From the 7th to 35th year after the project, the cost benefit would have a rapid increase, and tended to be stable after then, giving a weak ecological pressure and little services value loss, and benefiting the improvement of regional ecological environment.

77953708145	A new method of chaotic anti-control for line spectra reduction of vibration isolation system	Line spectra in the radiated noise of marine vessels are the most visible signs, which can be detected, tracked and identified by enemy's passive sonar. Insertion of resilient isolators between the machinery and the base is one of the most common methods for controlling unwanted vibration of the hull of submarine. Isolators in service are usually assumed to be linear and almost all the vibration isolation-n systems (VIS) are designed with linear theory, which satisfies engineering requirements in most situations. However, the nonlinear dynamical characteristics of VIS have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to the facts that onboard machinery trends towards more powerful and lighter, and that the demands in engineering for reducing vibration become more rigorous. Furthermore, some distinguishing features of nonlinear systems can be applied to achieve some special functions, among which the most important one is using chaos to reduce line spectra in the radiated noise of submarines based on the fact that response spectrum of a nonlinear system under harmonic excitation is a continuous one when chaos occurs. In this paper, a chaos synthesis method based on tracking control is prososed for a vibration isolation system (VIS) of on board machinery to make the chaotic motion in nonlinear VIS persistent. In this way, the line spectra in the radiated noise can be reduced effectively because the response spectrum of a chaotic system under harmonic excitations is a continuous and reduced one. Numerical simulations were carried out and the results showed that utilizing this method the nonlinear VIS not only possesses an excellent isolation performance of vibration and line spectra, but also reduces the amplitude of the isolated equipment notably.

The sodiated cyclic acylphosphoramidates (CAPAs) were formed through a characteristic pentacoordinate phosphate participated rearrangement reaction in the positive-ion ESI-MS/MS and HR-MS/MS of N-MAPAAs, in which the fragmentation patterns were clearly different from those observed in the corresponding ESI-MS/MS of N-dialkyloxyphosphoryl amino acids/peptides and N-phosphono amino acids. The formation of CAPAs depended on the chemical structures of N-terminal phosphoryl groups, such as alkyloxy group, negative charge and alkali metal ion. A possible integrated rearrangementmechanism for both P-N to P-O phosphoryl groupmigration and formation of CAPAs was proposed. The fragmentation patterns of CAPAs as novel intermediates in gas phase were also investigated. In addition, it was found that the formation of α-amino acid CAPAs was more favorable than β- or γ -CAPAs in gas phase, which was consistent with previous solution-phase experiments.

Objective: To further delineate the clinicopathological and radiological features of solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas and summari ze the surgical therapy strategy for this tumor. Methods: A retrospective review of 18 pathologically confirme dcases of SPT was performed and the clinical and pathological features, radiological findings and surgical interventions were analyzed. Results: The patients included 17 females and 1 male with a median age of 23 years. The median diameter of the lesions was 8.0 cm. Abdominal pain was the predominant complaint (8/18). The rest of the patients were asymptomatic and presented with a pancreatic mass detected incidentally. Radiological study revealed a well-demarcated mass which was composed of a solid-cystic portion. On post-contrast CT, the solid portions could be enhanced whereas the cystic parts remained unenhanced. With the preoperative diagnosis of SPT in 11 patients and pancreatic cyst, benign or malignant pancreatic tumor in the rest, pancreatic tumor resection was successfully completed. Surgical exploration findings, pathological characteristics and good prognosis of the patients with SPT, indicated its low-grade malignant potential. Conclusion: In combination with clinical findings, radiological features of SPT may help to make the correct diagnosis and differentiation from other pancreatic neoplasms. Once diagnosed, given the excellent prognosis and low-grade malignancy, less aggressive surgical resection of the primary lesion is proposed. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

77957896863	ProFITS of maize: A database of protein families involved in the transduction of signalling in the maize genome	Background: Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays L.) is an important model for plant basic and applied research. In 2009, the B73 maize genome sequencing made a great step forward, using clone by clone strategy; however, functional annotation and gene classification of the maize genome are still limited. Thus, a well-annotated datasets and informative database will be important for further research discoveries. Signal transduction is a fundamental biological process in living cells, and many protein families participate in this process in sensing, amplifying and responding to various extracellular or internal stimuli. Therefore, it is a good starting point to integrate information on the maize functional genes involved in signal transduction.Results: Here we introduce a comprehensive database 'ProFITS' (Protein Families Involved in the Transduction of Signalling), which endeavours to identify and classify protein kinases/phosphatases, transcription factors and ubiquitin-proteasome-system related genes in the B73 maize genome. Users can explore gene models, corresponding transcripts and FLcDNAs using the three abovementioned protein hierarchical categories, and visualize them using an AJAX-based genome browser (JBrowse) or Generic Genome Browser (GBrowse). Functional annotations such as GO annotation, protein signatures, protein best-hits in the Arabidopsis and rice genome are provided. In addition, pre-calculated transcription factor binding sites of each gene are generated and mutant information is incorporated into ProFITS. In short, ProFITS provides a user-friendly web interface for studies in signal transduction process in maize.Conclusion: ProFITS, which utilizes both the B73 maize genome and full length cDNA (FLcDNA) datasets, provides users a comprehensive platform of maize annotation with specific focus on the categorization of families involved in the signal transduction process. ProFITS is designed as a user-friendly web interface and it is valuable for experimental researchers.

On the basis of the theoretical model, the general dynamic response of the hull girder subjected to shock waves in near field was analyzed, and effects of explosion conditions and girder's dimensions on dynamic response were discussed. Results show that in common explosion conditions, the girder's plastic deformation take a course of firstly upward, then downward movement, and it finally takes a downward bending damage. In the same explosion condition, a linear relation can be found between girder's plastic limit bending moment, length, width, soleplate thickness and final plastic deformation.

The chaotifying technique for line spectra reduction can reduce the line spectra for improving the acoustic stealth of marine vessels, based on the fact that response spectrum of a nonlinear system under harmonic excitation is a continuous one when chaos occurs. In order to overcome two difficulties, i. e, how to maintain chaotic motion and how to obtain chaos under small amplitude in a vibration isolation system (VIS), arising from practical implements of the chaotifying technique for line spectra reduction, the tracking control method was proposed.

Liposomes were prepared by the ethanol-injection method. An optimized liposome formulation composed of phospholipid, cholesterol and Tween-80 resulted in favorable encapsulation efficiency at 98.06 ± 0.94%. Homogeneous and stable particle size of 89.6 ± 7.3 nm and zeta potential of-(87.7 ± 5.8) mV were determined by laser particle size analyzer. Subsequently, the four-site perfusion rat intestinal model revealed that celastrol-loaded liposomes had improved effective permeability compared to the free drug in four intestinal segments (p < 0.05). Moreover, celastrol-loaded liposomes could also inhibit the tumor growth in C57BL/6 mice.

It is closely related to an important legume, alfalfa. Transporters are a large group of membrane-spanning proteins. They deliver essential nutrients, eject waste products, and assist the cell in sensing environmental conditions by forming a complex system of pumps and channels. Although studies have effectively characterized individual M. truncatula transporters in several databases, until now there has been no available systematic database that includes all transporters in M. truncatula.Description: The M. truncatula transporter database (MTDB) contains comprehensive information on the transporters in M. truncatula. Based on the TransportTP method, we have presented a novel prediction pipeline. A total of 3,665 putative transporters have been annotated based on International Medicago Genome Annotated Group (IMGAG) V3.5 V3 and the M. truncatula Gene Index (MTGI) V10.0 releases and assigned to 162 families according to the transporter classification system. These families were further classified into seven types according to their transport mode and energy coupling mechanism. Extensive annotations referring to each protein were generated, including basic protein function, expressed sequence tag (EST) mapping, genome locus, three-dimensional template prediction, transmembrane segment, and domain annotation. A chromosome distribution map and text-based Basic Local Alignment Search Tools were also created. In addition, we have provided a way to explore the expression of putative M. truncatula transporter genes under stress treatments.Conclusions: In summary, the MTDB enables the exploration and comparative analysis of putative transporters in M. truncatula.

Although Baohuoside I exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities, its molecular targets/pathways in human lung cancer cells are poorly understood. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the usefulness of Baohuoside I as a potential apoptosis-inducing cytotoxic agent using human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells as in vitro model. The apoptosis induced by Baohuoside I in A549 cells was confirmed by annexin V/propidium iodide double staining, cell cycle analysis and dUTP nick end labeling. Further research revealed that Baohuoside I accelerated apoptosis through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, involving the increment of BAX/Bcl-2 ratio, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, transposition of cytochrome c, caspase 3 and caspase 9 activation, degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and the over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, only partially prevented apoptosis induced by Baohuoside I, while NAC, a scavenger of ROS, diminished its effect more potently. In addition, the apoptotic effect of Baohuoside I was dependent on the activation of ROS downstream effectors, JNK and p38

84863069059	Endovascular treatment of a giant internal carotid artery bifurcation aneurysm with drainage into cavernous sinus	This report documents the treatment of a giant aneurysm of the internal carotid artery bifurcation with a fistula to the cavernous sinus, which appeared following closed head trauma. A 39-year-old man suffered from a blunt head trauma in an automobile accident. Two weeks after the trauma, progressive chemosis of left eye was presented. Four months after the trauma, digital subtraction angiography showed an internal carotid artery bifurcation aneurysm, with drainage into the cavernous sinus. The lesion was successfully obliterated with preservation of the parent artery by using coils in conjunction with Onyx. Follow-up angiography obtained 3 months postoperatively revealed persistent obliteration of the aneurysm and fistula as well as patency of the parent artery. Endovascular treatment involving the use of coils combined with Onyx appears to be a feasible and effective option for treatment of this hard-to-treat lesion.

84870679159	Effect of β-cyclodextrin complexation on solubility and enzymatic conversion of naringin	In the present paper, the effect of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) inclusion complexation on the solubility and enzymatic hydrolysis of naringin was investigated. The inclusion complex of naringin/β-CD at the molar ratio of 1:1 was obtained by the dropping method and was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry. The solubility of naringin complexes in water at 37 ± 0.1 °C was 15 times greater than that of free naringin. Snailase-involved hydrolysis conditions were tested for the bioconversion of naringin into naringenin using the univariate experimental design. Naringin can be transformed into naringenin by snailase-involved hydrolysis. The optimum conditions for enzymatic hydrolysis were determined as follows: pH 5.0, temperature 37 °C, ratio of snailase/substrate 0.8, substrate concentration 20 mg·mL<sup>-1</sup>, and reaction time 12 h. Under the optimum conditions, the transforming rate of naringenin from naringin for inclusion complexes and free naringin was 98.7% and 56.2% respectively, suggesting that β-CD complexation can improve the aqueous solubility and consequently the enzymatic hydrolysis rate of naringin. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

However, baohuoside I has very poor oral absorption. Methods: In the present study, we prepared baohuoside I-phospholipid complexes of different diameters and determined their physicochemical properties using transmission electron microscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. The in vitro absorption of baohuoside I and baohuoside I-phospholipid complexes of different sizes were compared using the Caco-2 cell culture model, and subsequently, the bioavailability of baohuosidel and its complexes were estimated in vivo. Results: Compared with the large-sized phospholipid complexes, a nanoscale phospholipid complex improved the oral bioavailability of baohuoside I. In addition, our results suggest that the smaller the particle size, the faster the complexes crossed the Caco-2 monolayer and the faster they were resorbed after oral administration in rats.

Methods: We prepared CPP-coated tripterine-loaded NLCs (CT-NLCs) by using a solvent evaporation method, and determined their physical properties. In vitro drug release was determined by using a dialysis bag diffusion technique, and intestinal toxicity was evaluated by performing MTT assay using Caco-2 cells. In vivo absorption was studied in an in situ rat intestinal perfusion model, and oral bioavailability was examined in beagles. Results: The average particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency of the optimized CT-NLCs were 126.7 ± 9.2 nm, 28.7 ± 3.4 mV, and 72.64% ± 1.37%, respectively. The CT-NLCs showed a controlled release profile in vitro and had significantly lower intestinal cytotoxicity than the tripterine solution (P <0.05). The absorption levels of tripterine from the CT-NLCs in the rat duodenum and jejunum were markedly higher than with tripterine-loaded NLCs without the CPP coating (T-NLCs), and with tripterine solution. Pharmacokinetic study showed that the maximum concentration of the CT-NLCs was greater than that of the T-NLCs and tripterine suspension, and that the time to maximum concentration of the CT-NLCs as well as the T-NLCs, was longer than that of the tripterine suspension. The relative oral bioavailability of the CT-NLCs compared to that of tripterine suspension and T-NLCs were 484.75% and 149.91% respectively. Conclusion: The oral bioavailability of tripterine is dramatically increased by CT-NLCs. Therefore, CT-NLCs seem to be a promising carrier for oral delivery of tripterine. © 2012 Chen et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84870366629	Formulation, characterization, and evaluation of in vitro skin permeation and in vivo pharmacodynamics of surface-charged tripterine-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers	Background: Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are attractive materials for topical drug delivery, and in a previous study, we demonstrated that NLCs loaded with tripterine enhance its deposition. However, the surface charge of nanoparticles influences percutaneous drug penetration. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the influence of the surface charge of NLCs on in vitro skin permeation and in vivo pharmacodynamics of tripterine and optimize tripterine- loaded NLCs for the treatment of skin diseases. Methods: Different solid and liquid matrices were selected to prepare cationic, anionic, and neutral NLCs by the solvent evaporation method. The in vitro studies were evaluated by using Franz diffusion cells. The effect of surface-charged NLCs on cellular uptake was appraised across HaCaT and B16BL6 cells. The in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity of surface-charged NLCs was evaluated in B16BL6 cells and melanoma-bearing mice, respectively. Results: The average particle sizes of the cationic, anionic, and neutral NLCs were 90.2 ± 9.7, 87.8 ± 7.4, and 84.5 ± 10.2 nm, respectively; their encapsulation efficiencies were 64.3% ± 5.1%, 67.8% ± 4.4%, and 72.5% ± 4.9%, respectively. In vitro studies showed delayed tripterine release, and the order of skin permeation was cationic NLCs. anionic NLCs. neutral NLCs. Further, in vitro cytotoxicity studies showed that the cationic NLCs had the highest (P> 0.05) inhibition ratio in B16BL6 (melanoma) cells. Moreover, in vivo pharmacodynamic experiments in melanoma-bearing mice indicated that the cationic NLCs had significantly higher (P> 0.05) antimelanoma efficacy than the anionic and neutral NLCs. Conclusion: The surface charge of NLCs has a great influence on the skin permeation and pharmacodynamics of tripterine. Cationic tripterine-loaded NLCs could enhance the percutaneous penetration and antimelanoma efficacy of tripterine and offer several advantages over tripterine alone. Therefore, they are promising carriers of tripterine for topical antimelanoma therapy. © 2012 Chen et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84873688567	A novel drug-phospholipid complex enriched with micelles: Preparation and evaluation in vitro and in vivo	Mixed micelles are widely used to increase solubility and bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs. One promising antitumor drug candidate is 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD), although its clinical application is limited by low water solubility and poor bioavailability after oral administration. In this study, we developed mixed micelles consisting of PPD-phospholipid complexes and Labrasol® and evaluated their potential for oral PPD absorption. Micelles were prepared using a solvent-evaporation method, and their physicochemical properties, including particle size, zeta potential, morphology, crystal type, drug loading, drug entrapment efficiency, and solubility, were characterized. Furthermore, in vitro release was investigated using the dialysis method, and transport and bioavailability of the mixed micelles were investigated through a Caco-2 cell monolayer and in vivo absorption studies performed in rats. Compared with the solubility of free PPD (3 μg/mL), the solubility of PPD in the prepared mixed micelles was 192.41±1.13 μg/mL in water at room temperature.

In this study, Lf nanoparticles were firstly used as carriers of gambogic acid (GA) to enhance oral absorption and anti-cancer activity, hence reducing the related toxic effect. Methods: Gambogic acid-lactoferrin nanoparticles (GL-NPs) were prepared by the nanoparticle albumin-bound (NAB) technology. The formed nanoparticles were characterized by DSC, TEM, etc. In situ intestinal perfusion experiment was performed to clarify the absorption mechanism of GL-NPs. Furthermore in vivo and in vitro anti-tumor activities of GL-NPs were also investigated. Results: GL-NPs was successfully prepared with about 150 nm mean size, +20 mV ζ potential, 92.3 ± 7.2% encapsulation efficiency and 9.04 ± 0.7% DL; GL-NPs also exhibited a better stability and a desirable slow release in vitro experiment. The results of in situ intestinal perfusion showed a transformation of GA absorption from passive diffusion into active transport or facilitated diffusion by GL-NPs. MTT assay of GL-NPs showed almost an equal anti-proliferative effect with arginine solution of GA (Arg-GA) in HepG2 cell. The inhibitory rate against S180 tumor mice after oral administration of GL-NPs was up to 86.01% which was1.39-folds of intravenous injection of Arg-GA. Conclusion: The in vitro results showed that the NAB technology was feasible for industrial production of Lf nanoparticles and the in vivo results proved that the effective GL-NPs is a promising approach for the oral delivery of GA.

Unfortunately, baohuoside I has a very poor solubility in both water and in organic solvents. Besides that, it is subject to significant efflux. This work therefore aimed at evaluating the ability of mixed micelles to solubilize baohuoside I, increase permeability and inhibit efflux of baohuoside I to promote oral absorption. A novel (TPGS-baohuoside I-phospholipid complex) mixed micelles was formed by phospholipid complex and TPGS to increase the solubility, enhance permeability, and inhibit efflux of baohuoside I. Micelle formation was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry and transmission electron microscopy. The average diameters and efflux ratio of mixed micelles decreased as the ratio of TPGS increased with a respective increase in solubility of baohuoside I. Nevertheless, a slow release of baohuoside I from loaded micelles was noted. The results showed that at a 1:9 ratio for baohuoside I-phospholipid complex: TPGS in mixed micelles, solubility of baohuoside I increased up to 88 fold while the efflux ratio decreased by 85%. Their smaller size and higher zeta potential values indicated that mixed micelles would be easily absorbed and more stable. The relative bioavailability of the micelles (AUC

Some bacteria can swim in an aqueous environment. Therefore, flagellated chemotactic bacteria have been utilized as actuators for the propulsion of micro-objects by randomly attaching several bacteria to their surface. A liposome is a well-known component used for drug delivery that can contain biologically active compounds. In the present study, we used an antibody and biotin-streptavidin binding technique to combine bacteria and liposomes and create bacteria-driven liposomes. Furthermore, a novel raft domain binding technique was developed and used to limit the attachment of bacteria to small areas of the liposome surface. The effect of the number and configuration of the attached bacteria on propulsion speed was then studied experimentally. The motility of the raft domain liposome with bacteria was higher than that of the normal liposome with bacteria. This method could be used to create bacteria-driven liposomes with highly efficient motility and could lead to the development of microrobots as drug delivery systems. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84880000181	Multi-label feature selection algorithm based on information entropy	Multi-label classification is the learning problem where each instance is associated with a set of labels. Feature selection is capable of eliminating redundant and irrelevant features in multi-label classification, which leads to performance improvement of multi-label classifiers. However the existing feature selection methods have high computation complexity and are not able to give a reasonable feature subset. Hence a novel multi-label feature selection algorithm based on information entropy is proposed in this paper. It assumes that features are independent of each other. Its main ideas are: 1) The information gain between the feature and label set is derived from the information gain between the feature and the label, and employed to measure the correlation degree between them; 2) An threshold selection method is used to choose a reasonable feature subset from original features. The proposed algorithm firstly computes the information gain between each feature and label set, and then removes the irrelevant and redundant features according to the selected information gain value determined by threshold selection method. The experiment is conducted on four different datasets and two different classifiers. The experimental results and their analysis show that the proposed algorithm can effectively promote the performance of multi-label classifiers in multi-label classification.

Methods: The co-processd excipient containing MCC and GMS was prepared by applying spray drying method. The moisture absorption, flow ability, compressibility, and disintegration were as the indexes to optimize the best preparation of co-processd excipient through uniform design methodology. The powder characteristic of co-processd excipient was investigated and the microstructures were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Flourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy. The effect of co-processd excipient on the moisture absorption of spray drying power of Xinyueshu, epimedium total flavonoids, and wolfberry extracts was investigated. The in vitro dissolution of hyperside and ferulic acid in Xinyueshu Tablet was studied. Results: The results showed that the optimal conditions of the preparation consisted of 1 portion of GMS, 12 portions of MCC, and 200 portions of water, emulsionzing temperature of 66°C, and mixing time of 1 h. It was confirmed that the chemical constituents in co-processd excipient were not changed after spray drying with smaller particle size and better fluidity. The co-processd excipient can improve the moisture absorption of spray drying power of Xinyueshu, epimedium total flavonoids, and wolfberry extracts without affecting the disintegration of MCC. Conclusion: The co-processd excipient prepared has good humidity resistance and it is confirmed to have application prospect.

84899648298	Roles of sphincter of oddi motility and serum vasoactive intestinal peptide, gastrin and cholecystokinin octapeptide	AIM: To investigate roles of sphincter of Oddi (SO) motility played in pigment gallbladder stone formation in model of guinea pigs. METHODS: Thirty-four adult male Hartley guinea pigs were divided randomly into two groups: the control group and pigment stone group. The pigment stone group was divided into 4 subgroups with 6 guinea pigs each according to time of sacrifice, and were fed a pigment lithogenic diet and sacrificed after 3, 6, 9 and 12 wk. SO manometry and recording of myoelectric activity of the guinea pigs were obtained by multifunctional physiograph at each stage. Serum vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastrin and cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) were detected at each stage in the process of pigment gallbladder stone formation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The incidence of pigment gallstone formation was 0%, 0%, 16.7% and 66.7% in the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-wk group, respectively. The frequency of myoelectric activity decreased in the 3-wk group. The amplitude of myoelectric activity had a tendency to decrease but not significantly. The frequency of the SO decreased significantly in the 9-wk group. The SO basal pressure and common bile duct pressure increased in the 12-wk group (25.19 ± 7.77 mmHg vs 40.56 ± 11.81 mmHg, 22.35 ± 7.60 mmHg vs 38.51 ± 11.57 mmHg, P < 0.05). Serum VIP was significantly elevated in the 6- and 12-wk groups and serum CCK-8 was decreased significantly in the 12-wk group. CONCLUSION: Pigment gallstone-causing diet may induce SO dysfunction. The tension of the SO increased. The disturbance in SO motility may play a role in pigment gallstone formation, and changes in serum VIP and CCK-8 may be important causes of SO dysfunction. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Limited.

84902182384	Study on oral absorption enhancers of Astragalus polysaccharides	Astragalus polysaccharides was lounded to 4-(2-aminoethylphenol), followed by labeling the APS-Tyr with fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC) at the secondary amino group. The absorption enhancement effects of low molecular weight chitosan and protamine on astragalus polysaccharides were evaluated via Caco-2 cell culture model. The results show that the fluorecent labeling compound has good stability and high sensitivity. On the other hand low molecular weight chitosan and protamine also can promoted absorption of the astragalus polysaccharides without any cytotoxity, and the absorption increase was more significant with increasing the amount of low molecular weight chitosan and protamine. At the same time, the low molecular weight chitosan has slightly better effect. The transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) of Caco-2 cells show that absorption enhancers could improve its membrane transport permeability by opening tight junctions between cells and increasing the cell membrane fluidity.

84907150549	Stanniocalcin 2 expression predicts poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma	Previous studies have shown that the expression level of stanniocalcin 2 (STC2) is associated with tumor progression. However, to date, the association between STC2 and clinicopathological factors in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been investigated. The clinical significance of STC2 was investigated in 30 fresh HCC samples using western blot analysis and in 240 HCC tissues using immunohistochemical analysis. The level of STC2 in cancerous tissue was higher than in the matched non-cancerous tissues. Using immunohistochemistry, the STC2-positive group exhibited a higher incidence of lymph node metastasis and venous invasion compared with the STC2-negative group. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the positive expression of STC2 correlated with poor overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival of HCC patients (P<0.01). STC2 expression was observed to be an independent prognostic factor for OS in HCC patients by multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-5.89; P=0.013). These data suggest that STC2 expression may be a useful indicator of poor prognosis in HCC patients.

0347618664	Measurement of the branching ratios b → e v X, μ v X, τ v X and v X	The inclusive semileptonic branching ratios b → e vX, μ vX, τ vX and vX have been measured at LEP with the L3 detector. The analysis is based on 2-jet hadronic Z decays obtained in the data collected between 1991 and 1992. Three separate event samples are analysed, containing electrons, muons and large missing energy (neutrinos), respectively. From the electron sample, we measure Br(b → e vX) = (10.89±0.20±0.51)% and, from the muon sample, Br(b → μ vX) = (10.82±0.15±0.59)%, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. From the missing energy sample, we measure Br(b → vX) = (23.08±0.77±1.24)%, assuming the relative semileptonic decay rates e:μ:τ = 1:1:(0.25±0.05), according to theoretical expectations. From a combined analysis of all three samples and constraining the relative semileptonic rates, we measure Br(b → e vX) = Br(b → μ vX) = (10.68±0.11±0.46)%. Alternatively, we can remove the constraint on the relative semileptonic rates and measure Br(b → τ vX) = (1.7±0.5±1.1)%. © Springer-Verlag 1996.

84921841581	Data fault detection using multi-label classification in sensor network	Detection of data fault is a hit point in sensor network in recent years and multiple data faults may occur at the same time. However the existing detection methods can only detect one type of data fault at the same time. To solve this problem, the detection of data fault is model as multi-label classification task, where an instance may belong to more than one label. We firstly break down the sensor data into instances using sliding window and then employ feature extraction methods to extract data features from instances. After this we associate each instance with corresponding data fault labels. A comparative experimental evaluation of five multi-label classification algorithms is conducted on aforementioned multi-label dataset using a variety of evaluation measures. Experimental results and their analysis show preliminarily that: (1) LP outperforms other classification algorithms on all evaluation measures since it takes the correlation of multiple data fault labels into account in detection of data fault; (2) outlier is the easiest data fault to detect and high noise is the hardest data fault to detect.
