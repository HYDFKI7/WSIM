84928895295	Optimising data placement and traffic routing for energy saving in Backbone Networks	The energy consumption of network elements has become a big concern due to the exponential traffic growth and the rapid expansion of communication infrastructures. To deal with this problem, we propose a new approach called Backbone network Energy Saving based on Traffic engineering (BEST), which reduces the power consumption of network elements at the backbone level through jointly optimising data placement and traffic routing. Based on analysis on traffic characteristics, BEST firstly optimises the placement of data services such that the pairwise traffic demands can be better coordinated with the pairwise network costs, in order to minimise the traffic burden imposed on the network elements. Then, BEST optimises the routing of traffic flows and tries to find the minimum-power network subset that must remain active to fulfill the traffic requirements. Efficient heuristics are given by BEST to find an admissible solution when the problem size is very large. The simulation results illustrate the efficacy and efficiency of BEST in energy conservation on backbone networks.

84929412927	Improve channel availability in vehicular IPTV systems by a hybrid transmission scheme	One important factor restricting the capacity of IPTV service over vehicular-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks is the limited radio resource reserved on the road-side-units (RSUs). This paper elaborates a hybrid video transmission scheme to improve the channel availability in vehicular IPTV systems. The advanced scalable video coding (SVC) technique is applied to encode TV channels. SVC layers are transmitted in different modulation and coding schemes (MCSs), so as to provide differentiated robustness and resource utility efficiency. The hybrid transmission scheme intelligently delivers SVC layers to vehicles via either pure V2I or inter-vehicle relay connections. Comprehensive simulation experiments are conducted and show that, compared to the legacy V2I transmission scheme, the proposed hybrid scheme can effectively enhance user quality of experience (QoE) by significantly increasing channel availability, with only slightly deteriorating the transmission delay for the enhancement layers.

34547529827	An on-demand address allocation scheme for query based sensor networks	Current schemes for Wireless Sensor Network addressing are mainly based on static sensor node address which is determined in the process of deployment. However, with the increase of the network size, it is getting difficult to allocate the addresses manually for a large number of nodes. Moreover, the static address scheme is not able to deal with the complex situation in the real world due to dynamic death and replenishment of the sensor nodes. Although some dynamic address allocation schemes have been proposed, the frequent control messages exchange used by these schemes will lead to both excessive drain of limited power supply and increased collisions in wireless communication. In this paper, we propose a new efficient address allocation scheme for query based sensor networks. The proposed scheme allocates a temporary network-wide unique address only to the sensor node which reports data in response to an explicit query from the sink. We have evaluated our scheme performance through both analysis and extensive simulation experiments. Our evaluation results show that the proposed scheme exhibits better performance than existing schemes. ©2007 IEEE.

34948903326	EDDS: An efficient data delivery scheme for address-free wireless sensor networks	Addressing plays an important role in traditional networks but incurs much overhead for resource-constrained Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Therefore, address-free sensor network has been proposed by researchers. However, current data delivery schemes are mainly proposed for address-based sensor networks and can't be directly applied to the new architecture. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Data Delivery Scheme (EDDS) for address-free wireless sensor networks, in which data source nodes randomly select a probabilistically unique identifier for each data flow instead of statically assigned node addresses. The packet forwarding mechanism in EDDS combines the tasks of routing and MAC layer via cross-layer design, which simplifies the protocol stack while maintaining the necessary functionality. EDDS can also efficiently handle the changes of the network, such as node death and replenishment. Through analysis and simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme and compare it with some previous work. © 2007 IEEE.

77954304764	Reliable transmission protocol for wireless sensor networks and its simulation analysis	In the application of wireless sensor network (WSN), the unstable communication link will lead to much lower transmission reliability. A reliable transmission protocol based on dynamic cluster (DCMP) has been proposed for WSN. Utilizing the characteristic of highly dense deployment of nodes in WSN and broadcast feature of wireless channels, DCMP makes the packets forwarded in the unit of cluster in the process of data transmission. All cluster members constitute multiple paths in order to ensure the transmission reliability, and the number of forwarding members in the cluster is constrained to reduce the energy consumption of redundant transmission. The cluster is dynamic, which is elected through "back-off competition" mechanism before each hop of packet, and upon completion of packet forwarding task, the cluster automatically revoked. The simulation model for DCMP was established, and by using NS2, the simulation analysis of transmission performance of DCMP, such as transmission reliability, transmission delay and transmission energy consumption has been carried out. Simulation results prove the advantages of the proposed protocol in comparison to other similar protocols.

However, one of the challenges in LEO constellation is the development of an efficient and specialized routing scheme. This paper takes transmission rate and data transmission time into consideration, and proposes ERSVC, an efficient routing scheme for satellite constellation adapting vector composition. ERSVC reduces routing table computation complexity, and saves restricted satellite resources. By adapting vector composition method, the amount of data flowing into satellite constellation is maximized while the data traffic is well controlled.

The NNCS exploits the broadcast feature of wireless channels, and passes the retransmission or forwarding responsibility to a neighboring node that has successfully snooped the data transmission, so as to achieve better transmission efficiency by reducing retransmission times. In the NNCS, related nodes compete for cooperation tasks by sending data acknowledgement according to their transmission capabilities, and snoop the channel activities to avoid interference in competition. The simulation results show that, compared with the traditional retransmission-based scheme, the NNCS can achieve a higher transmission success probability with lower cost, and effectively reduce the end-to-end transmission delay.

In REDD, the clustering network architecture is formed by periodically selecting cluster heads among sensor nodes through dynamic competition. The intra-cluster communication is based on TDMA scheduling, in which a member node transmits its sensory data through an independent intra-cluster channel to its cluster head in the time slot assigned by the cluster head. The inter-cluster communication is based on CSMA competition, in which a connected overlay network is constructed among all cluster heads to forward the aggregated data through multi-hops to the sink. Simulation results show that, compared with the existing work, the REDD can achieve a better clustering performance with lower costs, and effectively reduce the end-to-end delay for reliable data transmission.

In this paper, having a clusterbased WSN, we present a compensation-based reliable data delivery protocol (CRDD) to collect and transmit sensory data timely, reliably, and energy-efficiently. The CRDD consists of three important parts: 1) reliability calculating mechanism, 2) information classifying mechanism, and 3) intelligent balancing mechanism. By using these three mechanisms, the CRDD can reduce redundant messages for enhancing the transmission performance and compensate the deficient messages for reliability. The simulation results show that CRDD can outperform both LEACH and ECDG and significantly improve sensory data collection speed and system dependability. © 2009 IEEE.

70749138826	Link-aware geographic routing in wireless sensor networks	To solve the problem that geographic routing using traditional greedy metric decreases successful packet delivery on non-ideal communication link, we propose a link-aware geographic routing (LAG). The LAG not only expects the minimum Euclidean distance between neighbor nodes and the destination, but also requires the better link quality between the current node and relevant neighbor nodes during the selection of the next hop. To avoid selecting the neighbor nodes with bad links as the next hop, the LAG employs the blacklist approach to filter them out under the threshold of link quality. The simulation results show that, compared with traditional greedy routing on the non-ideal links, the LAG increases the packet delivery rate by 22% and decreases energy consumption by 12%. Our simulations also demonstrate the LAG's scalability on densely deployed wireless networks. © 2009 IEEE.

74249102448	RRDD: Receiver-oriented robust data delivery in mobile sensor networks	Data forwarding in the wireless networks typically employs a sender-oriented approach in which the next hop node is pre-selected based on neighbor or network information. This method incurs large overhead when accurate information is neededfor making the optimal fonvarding decision. In this paper, a receiver-oriented robust data delivery scheme (RRDD) is proposed for mobile sensor networks. In RRDD, the sender does not appoint a specific fonvarder proactively, but allows its neighboring candidates to dynamically contendfor the data fonvarding task based on local state information. In this way, the best-suited node is elected at each hop to provide robust and efficient delivery service to data packets. Comprehensive simulations show that RRDD exhibits superior transmission performance over all of the compared schemes.

The scheme uses contours to represent the distribution of environment attribute value, that is, the contour is divided into pieces of Bezier curves, the shape and the position information of each Bezier curve is collected to one deputy node and is reported to the sink; and the sink uses the nodes coordinates and the received curve information to rebuild the contour curve. The number of report nodes is determined by the number of Bezier curve segments so that the traditional method that reports the information of all nodes on the contour is reformed. Simulation results show that the energy and bandwidth of network are saved efficiently by SENS-T, and a comparison with the traditional method at the same accuracy of counter mapping shows that the SENS-T saves approximately 45% network energy.

77951231752	Congestion avoidance, detection and alleviation in wireless sensor networks	Congestion in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) not only causes severe information loss but also leads to excessive energy consumption. To address this problem, a novel scheme for congestion avoidance, detection and alleviation (CADA) in WSNs is proposed in this paper. By exploiting data characteristics, a small number of representative nodes are chosen from those in the event area as data sources, so that the source traffic can be suppressed proactively to avoid potential congestion. Once congestion occurs inevitably due to traffic mergence, it will be detected in a timely way by the hotspot node based on a combination of buffer occupancy and channel utilization. Congestion is then alleviated reactively by either dynamic traffic multiplexing or source rate regulation in accordance with the specific hotspot scenarios. Extensive simulation results under typical congestion scenarios are presented to illuminate the distinguished performance of the proposed scheme. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

By exploiting the wireless broadcast nature and the node overhearing capability, we propose a novel cooperative communication scheme EECC to improve data transmission performance for wireless sensor networks. In this scheme, cooperative reply is performed at each hop by the bestsuited node elected from those that have successfully overheard the transmitted packet. EECC is not a routing protocol but rather works as an augment to minimize the impact of packet losses on network performance.

The approach considers the reality of low bandwidth and the requirement of high throughput in real-time media streaming so that it takes the forwarding capability of relay peers as the main evaluation metric. Probe data packets are introduced to real-time data transmission to help derive necessary feedback information. Receivers periodically calculate their available buffer size and send feedbacks to senders who use them to adjust the transmission rates. The mechanism for the dynamic adjustment of bandwidth requirements in media streaming is based on an adaptive rate threshold which adjusts the transmission rate according to the available bandwidth.

79955684500	ITDTS: A SIP-based telephone system for train dispatching	Train Dispatching Telephone System(TDTS) is a telephone system works for communication among train, railway station and railway dispatching center. The traditional TDTS works on 400MHz mode for voice analog, making it difficult to realize end-to-end communication. With the application of wireless access networks in railway, VoIP-based TDTS is tending to be a reality. Different from ordinary VoIP system, clients in TDTS have multi-level precedence. Client with high level precedence can disconnect or join in an existing session consisting of low level clients. For example, when emergency happens, the dispatcher, which has the highest precedence, can deliver the dispatching command to a busy station or a busy train driver through force-insert or force-disconnect. The call flow of force-insert and force-disconnect are also different from the call flow of the ordinary call. Therefore, this paper firstly gives a formalized system model to describe the relationship among different roles, different precedence and multiple call patterns. Based on the system model, this paper focuses on the analysis and design of the call flows of precedence based force-disconnect call and force-insert call. Although the three kinds of roles(train, station, and dispatcher) in TDTS have different precedence, they have almost the same service logic, namely, signaling processing, media processing. So we design a MVC(Model-View-Control) based GUI framework for the roles. Each kind of roles can be easily developed and maintained under such GUI framework. Utilizing session initiation protocol (SIP), we design and develop the whole system iTDTS. The performance of iTDTS is finally evaluated in a real railway line over IEEE 802.16. Our efforts show that iTDTS works well over IEEE 802.16 networks.

According to hardware capabilities of current sensor nodes, a cluster-based protocol for reliable and efficient data gathering in long-strip wireless sensor networks (LSWSN) is proposed. A well-distributed cluster-based architecture is first formed in the whole network through contention-based cluster head election. Cluster heads are responsible for coordination among the nodes within their clusters and aggregation of their sensory data, as well as transmission the data to the sink node on behalf of their own clusters. The intra-cluster coordination is based on the traditional TDMA schedule, in which the intercluster interference caused by the border nodes is solved by the multi-channel communication technique. The cluster reporting is based on the CSMA contention, in which a connected overlay network is formed by relay nodes to forward the data from the cluster heads through multi-hops to the sink node. The relay nodes are non-uniformly deployed to resolve the energy-hole problem which is extremely serious in the LSWSN.

Most of the early works on data center energy efficiency have focused on the biggest power consumers (i.e., computer servers and cooling systems), yet without taking the networking part into consideration.

Based on the analysis on topology characteristics and traffic patterns of data centers, this paper presents a novel approach, called VMPlanner, for network power reduction in the virtualization-based data centers. The basic idea of VMPlanner is to optimize both virtual machine placement and traffic flow routing so as to turn off as many unneeded network elements as possible for power saving. We formulate the optimization problem, analyze its hardness, and solve it by designing VMPlanner as a stepwise optimization approach with three approximation algorithms. VMPlanner is implemented and evaluated in a simulated environment with traffic traces collected from a data center test-bed, and the experiment results illustrate the efficacy and efficiency of this approach.© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84876465774	A novel mapping scheme and modified decoding algorithm for BICM-ID	This paper proposes a novel mapping scheme for bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID). The symbol mapping is composed of two QPSK with different radiuses and phases, called cross equalization-8PSK-quasi-semi set partitioning (CE-8PSK-Quasi-SSP). Providing the same average power, the proposed scheme can increase the minimum squared Euclidean distance (MSED) and then improve the receiving performance of BICM-ID compared with conventional symbol mapping schemes. Simultaneously, a modified iteration decoding algorithm is proposed in this paper. In the process of iteration decoding, different proportion of the extrinsic information to the systematic observations results in distinct decoding performance. At high SNR (4~9dB), the observation information plays a more important role than the extrinsic information. Simulation results show that the proportion set at 1.2 is more suitable for the novel mapping in BICM-ID. When the BER is 10-4, more than 0.9dB coding gain over Rayleigh channels can be achieved for the improved mapping and decoding scheme. © by HIGH TECHNOLOGY LETTERS PRESS.

84884955996	Study of dynamic spectrum access scheme in HD radio	In HD Radio (Hybrid Digital Radio), the spectra of analog FM and digital signal are combined in a fixed way. However, the bandwidth of FM varies dynamically, which result in the insufficient utilization of spectrum in HD Radio. This paper analyzes the effect of different parameters on dynamic spectrum access scheme in HD Radio. The scheme extends the digital spectrum after detecting the spare spectrum of analog signal. Moreover, the analog signal is maintained a stable quality grade by employing an evaluation measure-PEAQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality). Simulation results of four programs show that the saved bandwidth of the scheme will achieve average 15 kHz with 42.7 (ms) of frames and dynamic digital spectrum. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84886429960	A Dynamic Spectrum Access method for IBOC broadcasting based on the ear perception	In-Band On-Channel(IBOC) as an AM&FM digital broadcasting technology is used in HD Radio standard. In Hybrid of HD Radio, the spectra of analog FM signal and digital signal are combined in a fixed way, without taking full advantage of spectra. To solve this problem, this paper presents a Dynamic Spectrum Access(DSA) method, using the idle spectrum on time dimension. And the improved method brings in a Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality(PEAQ) module based on the ear perception as the evaluation criterion to measure audio quality. The simulation results show that on the basis of insuring audio quality, this method can save a lot of spectral bandwidth to improve the available spectrum resources. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84886444976	Metric-based PRT set selection in tone reservation scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM systmes	High peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is one of the main problems of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Tone reservation (TR) scheme employs a subset of reserved subcarriers to construct a cancellation signal for PAPR reduction, with no additional distortion, no side information, and low implementation cost. Thus, the optimal performance of TR scheme depends on the selection of the peak reduction tone (PRT) set. In the conventional TR schemes, we have known that PAPR reduction performance achieved by a randomly generated PRT set is superior to that by a consecutive PRT set and that achieved by an interleaved tone set. However, the search of optimal PRT set is a nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard problem and cannot be solved. In this paper, a metric-based PRT set selection algorithm is presented to provide good performance and fast convergence. The scheme employs a metric to measure how much each subcarrier contributes to the output signal samples of large magnitude and then subcarriers with the largest positive metrics are selected as PRT set for PAPR reduction. The simulation results show that when the reserved subcarriers number is 1.46 percent, the PAPR gain of the proposed method can achieve 0.74dB at least compared with the conventional TR schemes at the probability of 10

84886294398	Research on evaluation model of digital-analog interference for IBOC	HD Radio standard can realize the smooth transition from analog to digital using "in-band on-channel (IBOC)" technology, which is the most advantageous choice for analog broadcasting digitized. In HD Radio Hybrid and Extended waveform type, the digital signal employs the same carrier with the analog signal, and is transmitted on both sides of the analog FM signal. Since the digital carrier adjacent analog signal, the core to implement IBOC is the interference problem of digital signal to analog signal at the beginning of broadcasting digitized. For the interference evaluation model, this paper apply noise masking ratio (NMR) and objective evaluation level (ODG) as a combined evaluation factor for digital-analog interference in IBOC broadcasting. This interference evaluation method which utilizes the comprehensive advantages of NMR and ODG, with more scientific than the SNR measurements, can be widely used as an evaluation index for audio interference. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84890336247	Metric-based and angle-rotated tone reservation scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems	High Peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) has been a crucial problem in Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In all PAPR reduction schemes, Tone reservation (TR) technology is considered as one of the most promising methods because of no additional distortion, no side information, and low implementation cost. For conventional TR approaches, the assigned value to reserved subcarriers just considers one peak value and this brings peak value up again easily. In this paper, a novel scheme named Metric-based angle-rotated (MBAR) for TR is presented. The scheme employs a metric to measure how much each subcarrier contributes to the output signal samples of large magnitude and then subcarriers with the largest positive metrics are selected to reduce PAPR. The simulation results show that when the reserved subcarriers number is 1.46 percent, the PAPR gain of the proposed method can achieve 0.47dB at least at the probability of 10

84893004446	Diamond: An improved fat-tree architecture for large-scale data centers	With the widespread deployment of cloud services, data center networks are developing toward large-scale, multi-path networks. To support the new trend, some novel network architectures have been proposed, and Fat-tree is one of the most promising architecture and gets a lot of attention because it has good performance on aggregate bandwidth with a simple topology. This paper presents Diamond, an improved Fat-tree architecture for large-scale data centers. Diamond replaces all the aggregation switches of Fat-tree with edge switches and connects directly edge switches to core switches. By this alteration, the average route path and End-to-End (ETE) delay in Diamond are 10% less than that in Fat-tree. We design FAR, a simple and high-efficient routing method for Diamond. In FAR, each switch requires only hundreds of route entries to support a large-scale network with tens of thousands servers, and to build FAR routing tables, switches exchange very few messages. Diamond and its FAR routing are verified through OPNET simulations. © 2014 Engineering and Technology Publishing.

84898354919	Transmission control protocols for wireless sensor networks	Transmission control is an important issue for supporting Quality of Services (QoS) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). This chapter gives an introduction to the transmission control relevant protocols and algorithms, often developed for particular applications to reflect the application-specific requirements. According to the functionality, the existing works can be categorized into three main types: congestion control, reliability guarantee and fairness guarantee. Due to the unique constraints of WSNs, these transmission control protocols are not "cleanly" placed on top of the network layer, but call for careful cross-layer design. In the end, some exciting open issues are presented in order to stimulate more research interest in this largely unexplored area. © 2010, IGI Global.

84898953626	EESE: Energy-efficient communication between satellite swarms and earth stations	The promising projects of satellite swarm have been studied by scientists from NASA, ESA and other institutes around the world. With a massive number of pico-class, low-power and low-weight space-crafts like pico-satellites, nano-satellites, Swarm can exploring outer space environment or taking other tasks that are hard to be fulfilled by common satellites. The other merit of using swarm than common satellite is cost reduction. Besides all the advantages of satellite swarm, developing swarm-based satellite systems from conceptualization to validation is a complex multi-disciplinary activity. Swarm is commonly energy-constrained, so one of the key challenges is how to achieve energy-efficient data transmission between the satellite swarm and terrestrial terminal stations. By employing Lyapunov optimization, we present an online control algorithm called EESE for optimally dispatching traffic load among different satellite-ground links to minimize overall energy consumption over time. Our algorithm is able to independently and simultaneously make control decisions about traffic dispatching on ISLs and UDLs to offer provable energy and delay guarantees, without requiring any statistical information of traffic arrivals and link conditions. Rigorous analysis has demonstrated the performance and robustness of our algorithm. © 2014 Global IT Research Institute (GIRI).

84899719235	A dynamic spectrum access scheme based on psychoacoustics for IBOC system	HD Radio standard realize a smooth transition from analog to digital broadcasting with In-band Onchannel (IBOC) technology, which is the most advantageous choice for analog broadcasting digitized. In HD Radio Hybrid waveform type, the digital signal is transmitted on both sides of the analog FM signal, and the digital signal on 130 kHz from the carrier. However, the FM bandwidth changes along with the frequency and amplitude of the baseband signal, which provide opportunities for dynamic access of digital signal. This paper utilizes the masking characteristics of the analog signal based on the psychoacoustics to allocate dynamically the spectral position of the digital signal. The purpose is to save the spectrum resources through the Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) of digital signal, under the premise of each frame signal has the same Noise Masking Ratio (NMR). © 2014 Binary Information Press.

84903266347	Achieving optimal admission control with dynamic scheduling in energy constrained network systems	This paper considers optimization of time average admission rate in an energy-constrained network system with multiple classes of data flows. The system operates regularly over time intervals called frames, while each frame begins with a fixed-length active period and ends with a variable-length idle period. At the beginning of the frame, the system chooses a service mode from a collection of options that affect the class and the amount of data flow served as well as the energy incurred in the active period. After service, the system chooses an amount of time to remain idle. The optimization goal is to make decisions over time that maximizes a weighted sum of admitted data rates subject to constraints on queue stability and energy expenditure. However, conventional solutions suffer from a curse of dimensionality for systems with large state space. Therefore, using a generalized Lyapunov optimization technique, we design a new online control algorithm that solves the problem. The algorithm can push time average admission rate close to optimal, with a corresponding tradeoff in average queue backlog. Remarkably, it does not require any knowledge of the data arrival rates and is provably optimal. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84906099723	On the throughput-energy tradeoff for data transmission between cloud and mobile devices	Mobile cloud computing has recently emerged as a new computing paradigm promising to improve the capabilities of resource-constrained mobile devices. As the data processing and storage are moved from mobile devices to powerful cloud platforms, data transmission has become an important issue affecting user experiences of mobile applications. One of the challenges is how to optimize the tradeoff between system throughput and energy consumption, which are potentially conflicting objectives. Inspired by the feasibility of transmission scheduling for prefetching-friendly or delay-tolerant applications, we mathematically formulate this problem as a stochastic optimization problem, and design an online control algorithm to balance such an energy-performance tradeoff based on the Lyapunov optimization framework. Our algorithm is able to independently and simultaneously make control decisions on admission and transmission to maximize a joint utility of the average application throughput and energy cost, without requiring any statistical information of traffic arrivals and link bandwidth. Rigorous analysis and extensive simulations have demonstrated both the system stability and the utility optimality achieved by our control algorithm. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84918835581	A modified dynamic spectrum access scheme for IBOC system based on PEAQ algorithm	HD Radio uses the In-band On-channel (IBOC) technology that fits China's national conditions. However, HD Radio Hybrid waveform has the low utilization of spectrum because of the fixed spectrum position. A Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) scheme for IBOC system has been proposed before, but it is not general applicability and the gain-bandwidth is not the best. In this paper, a Modified Dynamic Spectrum Access (MDSA) scheme is presented to solve these problems. The MDSA scheme allocates the spectrum position of the digital signal dynamically according to the masking characteristics of the real-time analog signal based on Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ) algorithm. While ensuring audio quality doesn't decrease, the MDSA scheme increases the available spectrum of digital signal and improves the utilization of spectrum.
