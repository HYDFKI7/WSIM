14944378118	Removing eye-movement artifacts from the EEG during the intracarotid amobarbital procedure	Purpose: The EEG is often recorded during the intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP) to help in the assessment of the spatial extent and the duration of the effect of the drug. In scalp recordings, the EEG is always heavily contaminated with eye movement artifacts as the patient actively performs visual tasks. Methods: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a new technique for blind source separation. In this study, we separated the EEG data recorded during the IAP into independent components using ICA. The EEG signal was reconstructed by excluding the components related to eye movement and eye blinks. Results: EEGs from 10 IAP tests were analyzed. The experimental results indicate that ICA is very efficient at subtracting eye-movement artifacts, while retaining the EEG slow waves and making their interpretation easier. Conclusions: ICA appears to be a generally applicable and effective method for removing ocular artifacts from EEG recordings during IAP, although slow waves and ocular artifacts share similar frequency distributions. © 2005 International League Against Epilepsy.

80052598424	Fractal intercept analysis of EEG and its application for seizure detection	Nonlinear features of electroencephalogram (EEG) vary with epileptic seizure, and the feature analysis and detection of epileptic EEG are significant in diagnosis and therapy of epilepsy. This paper presents an epileptic EEG analysis approach based on blanket dimension and fractal intercept features, and applies fractal intercept to epileptic EEG detection. We extract fractal intercept and blanket dimension features of EEG, and compare the mean and variance of those two features. Then, a support vector machine is applied to classify epileptic EEG signals. It is found that the fractal intercept features of EEG during epileptic seizure are significantly higher than interictal EEG' s, while the blanket dimension features of EEG show no significant differences before and after seizures. The fractal intercept as a classification feature could be used to distinguish epileptic EEG from interical EEG with high performance for seizure detection, and the classification accuracy is up to 96%.

WT possesses well localization feature both in time and frequency domains. It acts as a group of band-pass filters to decompose mixed signal into signals at different frequency bands. EEG, as a noninvasive testing method, plays a key role in the diagnosing diseases, and is useful for both physiological research and medical applications. Using the dyadic wavelet transform, the EEG signals are successfully decomposed to the alpha rhythm (8-13Hz), beta rhythm (14-30Hz), theta rhythm (4-7Hz), and delta rhythm (0.3-3Hz), and the EMG trembles in EEG are effectively removed while the useful information of EEG are well reserved so as to improve SNR.

78049446723	BLDA approach for classifying P300 potential	Brain-computer interface (BCI) provides the brain with a new communication and control channel for conveying messages and commands to the outside world. BCIs require effective on-line processing of EEG or P300 which appeared just 300ms after the event happened. In this paper, we use a method of Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) to classify P300 signals from the data set of BCI Competition III. P300 are obtained when subjects were facing a screen on which flashed objects were displayed. Before training a classification parameter for the BLDA, several preprocessing operations were applied to the data including filtering, trial extraction et al. With the BLDA algorithm, the classification accuracy in our experiment could be up to above 80%, depends on the averaged times of trials and SNR of the data. In summary, it is suitable to use LDA in the P300-based BCI system, and LDA will be a promising method to extract feature for BCI designs. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

Correlation Dimension (CD) and Approximate Entropy (ApEn) were calculated for one hundred segments of epileptic EEG and one hundred segments of normal EEG. A comparison is made between epileptic and normal EEG in those nonlinear parameters. Results show that the mean value of CD is 2.64 for epileptic EEG, and 5.22 for normal EEG. The mean value of ApEn is 0.64 for epileptic EEG, and 0.95 for normal EEG. Both CD and ApEn of epileptic EEG are generally lower than that of normal EEG, and there are statistically significant differences between those nonlinear features of epileptic and normal EEG signals. This indicates the degree of complexity of epileptic EEG signals is lower than that of normal EEG signals, and the nonlinear parameters such as CD and ApEn could be helpful for distinguishing epileptic EEG and normal EEG. ©2010 IEEE.

78650830112	Feature analysis of epileptic EEG using nonlinear prediction method	We propose a feature extraction method based on the Volterra autoregressive model's prediction power and the data's predictability for the EEG signals to automatically detect the epileptic EEG signals from the EEG recordings. The method of determining the embedding dimension based on nonlinear prediction is applied to choose the embedding dimension of the EEG data. The proposed feature extraction method is used to extract the feature for three groups of EEG time series composing epileptic seizure. We divide the EEG data into segments, and respectively compute the feature values of each segment, where the length of data segment respectively takes the value of 250, 500, 1000 points. To investigate the robustness of our method under noises, we also analyze the three EEG time series with additive white Gaussian noise. The experiment results show that the feature values extracted with the proposed method could obviously distinguish the epileptic EEG signals from the normal EEG signals. The proposed method is effective for short time series, insensitive to the length of data segment, and robust to the additive white noise, and it could differentiate the epileptic EEG from the normal EEG when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. © 2010 IEEE.

79960110237	Medical image registration using thin-plate spline for automatically detecting and matching of point sets	This paper presents a non-rigid registration method for medical images by applying thin-plate spline (TPS) transform. The thin-plate spline which has special spline properties has been widely used in non-rigid image registration. TPS transform registration scheme based on landmarks often extracts two sets of landmarks from different images. Corners often represent critical information to describe object features, and they are usually used as landmarks in image registration. The corner detecting method proposed in this paper is performed according to local properties (such as local maxima curvature) and global properties (such as the relationship between neighboring features in the contours). This method can also distinguish obtuse corners from round corners, and obtuse corners are much more valuable and useful for representing the shape of objects. The feature points are matched with coherent point drift method based on probability density estimation. This method can be used in both rigid and non-rigid point set registration. The proposed method is applied in CT and CBCT image registration, and achieves ideal results. © 2011 IEEE.

79960113731	Corner detecting based on nonlinear complex diffusion process	This paper proposes a technique for detecting corners of medical images based on complex diffusion process. A corner detecting method based on global and local curvature properties has been traditionally used in extracting feature points in images. This kind method is ineffective for objects which have multiplesize features since the curvature measures are only based on single scale regions. Corner detection could perform better at multiple scales. The usually used multiple scale space function which is generated by convolving a 2-D image with a varying-scale Gaussian smoothing function often blurs the edges of the image and causes important information loss. Anisotropic diffusion methods can provide a hierarchical representation of images in scales ranging from coarse to fine. Nonlinear diffusion process of a partial differential equation (PDE) can make edges preserved and has been widely used in image enhancement and denoising. With the PDE method, we extend the analysis from the real axis to the complex domain. An important observation is that in complex diffusion, the imaginary part of the image can serve as an edge detector (smoothed second derivative scaled by time) when the complex diffusion coefficient approaches the real axis. A synthesis corner detecting method based on complex diffusion, and global and local curvature properties is proposed, and the results show that more corners at different real and imaginary part of the image can be detected, which is important for segmentation and registration of images. © 2011 IEEE.

This paper presents a new EEG classification approach based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) and nonlinear dynamical features. The theory of nonlinear dynamics has been a powerful tool for understanding brain electrical activities. Nonlinear features extracted from EEG signals such as approximate entropy (ApEn), Hurst exponent and scaling exponent obtained with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) are employed to characterize interictal and ictal EEGs. The statistics indicate that the differences of those nonlinear features between interictal and ictal EEGs are statistically significant. The ELM algorithm is employed to train a single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) with EEG nonlinear features. The experiments demonstrate that compared with the backpropagation (BP) algorithm and support vector machine (SVM), the performance of the ELM is better in terms of training time and classification accuracy which achieves a satisfying recognition accuracy of 96.5% for interictal and ictal EEG signals. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

80855164495	EEG non-linear feature extraction using correlation dimension and Hurst exponent	In this work, we evaluated the differences between epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) and interictal EEG by computing some non-linear features. Correlation dimension (CD) and Hurst exponent (H) were calculated for 100 segments of epileptic EEG and 100 segments of interictal EEG. A comparison was made between epileptic EEG and interictal EEG in those non-linear parameters. Results show that the mean values of CD are 2.64 for epileptic EEG and 4.55 for interictal EEG. We also calculated approximate entropy (ApEn) of those EEG signals. The mean values of ApEn are 0.90 for epileptic EEG and 4.55 for interictal EEG. The values of CD and ApEn of epileptic EEG are generally lower than those of interictal EEG, indicating less complexity of EEG signals during seizures. The mean values of Hurst exponent are 0.19 for epileptic EEG and 0.29 for interictal EEG. Hurst exponents for epileptic EEG and interictal EEG are both < 0.5. This indicates that both epileptic and interictal EEGs show long-range anticorrelation. The value of Hurst exponent of epileptic EEG signals is lower than that of interictal EEG signals, showing that the degree of anticorrelation of epileptic EEG signals is larger than that of interictal EEG. Hence, the non-linear parameters such as CD and Hurst exponent can help interpret epileptic and interictal EEGs and their neurodynamics. © W. S. Maney & Son Ltd 2011.

84857981136	Corner detecting of medical images based on nonlinear complex diffusion and global and local curvature properties	The common corner detecting methods only consider the local properties such as extremum curvature value, and are performed with single-scale images, Which often leads to missing true corners, and they are apt to be interfered by noise. In order to overcome these drawbacks, a new synthetical corner detecting method combing multi-scale analysis method based on nonlinear complex diffusion and global and local curvature properties is proposed. In this method, multi-scale scales images can be obtained by applying nonlinear complex diffusion which can preserve the edges very well. Then corners are detected according to not only its local curvature properties, but also the relationship between neighboring points in the contours. The experiments show that this method can get rid of noise disturbance, and detect more and accurate corners than original methods, and can be widely used in image registration and segmentation.

An iris feature extraction algorithm is proposed by using combination of blanket dimension and lacunarity. Because Human iris texture is characterized by fractal geometry due to its rich self-similarity and abundant variation, vertically expanded blanket dimension is employed to represent iris texture variation and radial pattern at different resolution levels. Lacunarity is introduced to extract iris features that have different texture and fractal patterns but have same fractal dimension value. The combination of blanket dimension and lacunarity in iris feature extraction can embody the minute change of texture information comprehensively, and improve the capacity of iris classification. The experimental results on the CASIA-IrisV3-Interval iris database show that the combination of blanket dimension and lacunarity can extract iris textural features accurately and effectively, and high performance for iris recognition is achieved by using those features.

84876296262	Synchronization regulation in a model of coupled neural masses	A model of coupled neural masses can generate seizure-like events and dynamics similar to those observed during interictal to ictal transitions and thus can be used for theoretical study of the control of epileptic seizures. In an effort to understand the mechanisms underlying epileptic seizures and how to avoid them, we added a control input to this model. Epileptic seizures are always accompanied by hypersynchronous firing of neurons, so research on synchronization among cortical areas is significant for seizure control. In this study, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify synchronization clusters composed of several neural masses. A method for calculating the synchronization cluster strength and participation rate is presented. The synchronization cluster strength can be used to identify synchronization clusters and the participation rate can be employed to identify neural masses that participate in the clusters. Each synchronization cluster is controlled as a whole using a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. We illustrate these points using coupled neural mass models of synchronization to show their responses to increased (between node) coupling with and without control. Experiment results indicated that PID control can effectively regulate synchronization between neural masses and has the potential for seizure prevention. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84878902261	Feature extraction and recognition of ictal EEG using EMD and SVM	Automatic seizure detection is significant for long-term monitoring of epilepsy, as well as for diagnostics and rehabilitation, and can decrease the duration of work required when inspecting the EEG signals. In this study we propose a novel method for feature extraction and pattern recognition of ictal EEG, based upon empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and support vector machine (SVM). First the EEG signal is decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using EMD, and then the coefficient of variation and fluctuation index of IMFs are extracted as features. SVM is then used as the classifier for recognition of ictal EEG. The experimental results show that this algorithm can achieve the sensitivity of 97.00% and specificity of 96.25% for interictal and ictal EEGs, and the sensitivity of 98.00% and specificity of 99.40% for normal and ictal EEGs on Bonn data sets. Besides, the experiment with interictal and ictal EEGs from Qilu Hospital dataset also yields a satisfactory sensitivity of 98.05% and specificity of 100%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84880725013	Seizure detection in clinical EEG based on entropies and EMD	Considering the EEG signals are nonlinear and nonstationary, the nonlinear dynamical methods have been widely applied to analyze the EEG signals. Directly extracted the approximate entropy and sample entropy as features are efficient methods to analysis the EEG signals of epileptic parents. To detect the epilepsy seizure signals from epileptic EEG, choose an appropriate threshold value as the discrimination criteria is simplest. The experiment indicated the approximate entropy provide a higher accuracy in distinguishing the epileptic seizure signals from the EEG than sample entropy. To improve the accuracy of sample entropy, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used to decompose EEG into multiple frequency subbands, and then calculate sample entropy for each component. The results show that the accuracy is up to 91%, which could be used to discriminate epileptic seizure signals from epileptic EEG. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84881226214	Epileptic seizure detection method using multi-features of intracranial EEG	The automatic seizure detection and classification are significant in both diagnosis of epilepsy and relieving heavy working load of doctors. In this paper we proposed a new seizure detection method based on multi-features of long-term intracranial EEG. After wavelet and half-wave decomposition, differeutial variance, relative energy and relative fluctuation index were used to characterize seizure activity as three features. Then the feature vector was fed to Bayesian formulation which was used as a classifier. A sensitivity of 94.2%, average specificity of 95.6% and a false detection rate of 1.16 per hour were achieved with long-term intracranial EEG from Freiburg dataset. The experimental results indicated that this method is able to detect epileptic seizures effectively and its low computational complexity made it suitable for real-time seizure detection.

84882794567	The feature extraction method of EEG signals based on degree distribution of complex networks from nonlinear time series	The nonlinear time series analysis method based on complex networks theory gives a novel perspective to understand the dynamics of the nonlinear time series. Considering the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals showing different nonlinear dynamics under different brain states, this study proposes an epileptic EEG analysis approach based on statistical properties of complex networks and applies the approach to epileptic EEGs automatic detection. Firstly, the complex network is constructed from the epileptic EEG signals and the degree distribution (DDF) of the resulting networks is calculated. Then the entropy of the degree distribution (NDDE) is used as a feature to classify the ictal EEGs and the interictal EEGs. The experiment results show that the NDDE of the ictal EEG is lower than interictal EEG's and the classification accuracy, taking the NDDE as a classification feature, is up to 96.25%. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

84883192538	Seizure detection in clinical EEG based on multi-feature integration and SVM	Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) was a nonlinear analysis method and widely used to analyze EEG signals. In this work, a feature extraction method based on the RQA measures was proposed to detect the epileptic EEG from EEG recordings. To combine the time-frequency characteristic of epileptic EEG, variation coefficient and fluctuation index were used to analyze epileptic EEG. The multi-feature combination of RQA and linear parameters had better performance in analyzing the nonlinear dynamic characteristics and time-frequency characteristic of epileptic EEG. For features selection and improving the classification accuracy, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used.

84887123519	Comparison of ictal and interictal eeg signals using fractal features	The feature analysis of epileptic EEG is very significant in diagnosis of epilepsy. This paper introduces two nonlinear features derived from fractal geometry for epileptic EEG analysis. The features of blanket dimension and fractal intercept are extracted to characterize behavior of EEG activities, and then their discriminatory power for ictal and interictal EEGs are compared by means of statistical methods. It is found that there is significant difference of the blanket dimension and fractal intercept between interictal and ictal EEGs, and the difference of the fractal intercept feature between interictal and ictal EEGs is more noticeable than the blanket dimension feature. Furthermore, these two fractal features at multi-scales are combined with support vector machine (SVM) to achieve accuracies of 97.58% for ictal and interictal EEG classification and 97.13% for normal, ictal and interictal EEG classification. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

84888080811	Seizure prediction using spike rate of intracranial EEG	Reliable prediction of forthcoming seizures will be a milestone in epilepsy research. A method capable of timely predicting the occurrence of seizures could significantly improve the quality of life for epilepsy patients and open new therapeutic approaches. Seizures are usually characterized by generalized spike wave discharges. With the advent of seizures, the variation of spike rate (SR) will have different manifestations. In this study, a seizure prediction approach based on spike rate is proposed and evaluated. Firstly, a low-pass filter is applied to remove the high frequency artifacts in electroencephalogram (EEG). Then, the morphology filter is used to detect spikes and compute SR, and SR is smoothed with an average filter. Finally, the performance of smoothed SR (SRm) in EEG during interictal, preictal, and ictal periods is analyzed and employed as an index for seizure prediction. Experiments with long-term intracranial EEGs of 21 patients show that the proposed seizure prediction approach achieves a sensitivity of 75.8% with an average false prediction rate of 0.09/h. The low computational complexity of the proposed approach enables its possibility of applications in an implantable device for epilepsy therapy. © 2013 IEEE.

84889578073	Epileptic seizure detection using lacunarity and bayesian linear discriminant analysis in intracranial EEG	Automatic seizure detection plays an important role in long-term epilepsy monitoring, and seizure detection algorithms have been intensively investigated over the years. This paper proposes an algorithm for seizure detection using lacunarity and Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) in long-term intracranial EEG. Lacunarity is a measure of heterogeneity for a fractal. The proposed method first conducts wavelet decomposition on EEGs with five scales, and selects the wavelet coefficients at scale 3, 4, and 5 for subsequent processing. Effective features including lacunarity and fluctuation index are extracted from the selected three scales, and then sent into the BLDA for training and classification. Finally, postprocessing which includes smoothing, threshold judgment, multichannels integration, and collar technique is applied to obtain high sensitivity and low false detection rate. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on 289.14 h intracranial EEG data from 21-patient Freiburg dataset and yields a sensitivity of 96.25% and a false detection rate of 0.13/h with a mean delay time of 13.8 s. © 2013 IEEE.

84888434145	Palmprint recognition algorithm with horizontally expanded blanket dimension	As an emerging biometric technology, palmprint recognition has been extensively researched due to its easy collection, user friendliness, high verification accuracy and reliability. Blanket dimension is a commonly used fractal dimension and has the multi-resolution characteristics with which the image texture information can be better extracted. In this work, palmprint recognition with blanket dimension and its expansions was investigated. The efficiencies of horizontally and vertically expanded blanket dimensions for extracting the directional feature of palmprint were compared, and a palmprint recognition algorithm based on horizontally expanded blanket dimension (HEBD) was proposed according to the comparison results. Furthermore, a multi-scale HEBD (MHEBD) algorithm for palmprint recognition was also presented, and the MHEBD was demonstrated to be more effective than the single-scale HEBD for feature extraction. The algorithm was evaluated on Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) database (v2) and CASIA database. The experimental results indicate that the multi-scale HEBD can extract the palmprint features effectively and efficiently with a high recognition rate and less processing time. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84893014401	Automatic seizure detection using diffusion distance and BLDA in intracranial EEG	Approximately 1% of the world's population suffers from epilepsy. An automatic seizure detection system is of great significance in the monitoring and diagnosis of epilepsy. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for automatic seizure detection in intracranial EEG recordings. The EEG recordings are divided into 4-s epochs, and then wavelet decomposition with five scales is performed to the EEG epochs. Detail signals at scales 3, 4, and 5 are selected to form a signal distribution. The diffusion distances are extracted as features, and Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) is used as the classifier. A total of 193.75. h of intracranial EEG recordings from 21 patients having 87 seizures are employed to evaluate the system, and the average sensitivity of 94.99%, specificity of 98.74%, and false-detection rate of 0.24/h are achieved.

84893264643	A novel direct feature-based seizure detector: Using the entropy of degree distribution of epileptic EEG signals	The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with different brain states show different nonlinear dynamics. Recently the statistical properties of complex networks theory have been applied to explore the nonlinear dynamics of time series, which studies the dynamics of time series via its organization. This study combines the complex networks theory with epileptic EEG analysis and applies the statistical properties of complex networks to the automatic epileptic EEG detection. We construct the complex networks from the epileptic EEG series and then calculate the entropy of the degree distribution of the network (NDDE). The NDDE corresponding to the ictal EEG is lower than interictal EEG's. The experiment result shows that the approach using the NDDE as a classification feature obtains robust performance of epileptic seizure detection and the accuracy is up to 95.75%. © 2013 APSIPA.

84904207914	Classification of motor imagery tasks for electrocorticogram based brain-computer interface	Purpose: In the present study, we propose a novel scheme for motor imagery (MI) classification of multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings from patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy. Methods: This scheme proposes a combination of the two features which includes autoregressive (AR) model coefficients and local binary pattern (LBP) operators. It can provide spatial resolution and angular space information. Then the gradient boosting (GB) in conjunction with ordinary least squares (OLS) algorithm is employed as the classifier to improve the performance of MI classification for ECoG based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system. Results: Experimental results on the BCI Competition III data set I indicate that the novel method has excellent performance and yields a cross-validation accuracy of 88.8% and accuracy of 93%, respectively. Conclusions: From the experimental results and comparative studies, we can infer that the scheme may serve as a good MI classification tool for a better tradeoff between the classification accuracy and computational complexity. © 2014 Korean Society of Medical and Biological Engineering and Springer.

84906940240	A low computation cost method for seizure prediction	The dynamic changes of electroencephalograph (EEG) signals in the period prior to epileptic seizures play a major role in the seizure prediction. This paper proposes a low computation seizure prediction algorithm that combines a fractal dimension with a machine learning algorithm.The presented seizure prediction algorithm extracts the Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) of EEG signals as features to classify the patient's preictal or interictal state with Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) as a classifier. The outputs of BLDA are smoothed by a Kalman filter for reducing possible sporadic and isolated false alarms and then the final prediction results are produced using a thresholding procedure. The algorithm was evaluated on the intracranial EEG recordings of 21 patients in the Freiburg EEG database.For seizure occurrence period of 30. min and 50. min, our algorithm obtained an average sensitivity of 86.95% and 89.33%, an average false prediction rate of 0.20/h, and an average prediction time of 24.47. min and 39.39. min, respectively. The results confirm that the changes of HFD can serve as a precursor of ictal activities and be used for distinguishing between interictal and preictal epochs. Both HFD and BLDA classifier have a low computational complexity. All of these make the proposed algorithm suitable for real-time seizure prediction. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84908378443	Face recognition using bit-plane images and collaborative representation	As a new representation approach, collaborative representation was employed to collaboratively represent the query image by all training images from all classes. In this paper, a novel face recognition algorithm using collaborative representation based on the binary bit-plane images had been proposed. The original gray images are firstly equalized and decomposed into 8 bit-plane images. And then the new virtual face images, which contained more discrimination information, were constructed by the 8 bit-plane images and the weight vector that was calculated by the recognition rate and the order of the bit-plane. Finally the collaborative representation was performed on the virtual face images. Experimental results show the proposed combination approach has very competitive classification rate and recognition speed.

84914673793	Bifurcation and oscillation in a time-delay neural mass model	The neural mass model developed by Lopes da Silva et al. simulates complex dynamics between cortical areas and is able to describe a limit cycle behavior for alpha rhythms in electroencephalography (EEG). In this work, we propose a modified neural mass model that incorporates a time delay. This time-delay model can be used to simulate several different types of EEG activity including alpha wave, interictal EEG, and ictal EEG. We present a detailed description of the model’s behavior with bifurcation diagrams. Through simulation and an analysis of the influence of the time delay on the model’s oscillatory behavior, we demonstrate that a time delay in neuronal signal transmission could cause seizure-like activity in the brain. Further study of the bifurcations in this new neural mass model could provide a theoretical reference for the understanding of the neurodynamics in epileptic seizures.

ICA is a novel signal processing technique based on high order statistics, and is used to separate independent components from measurements. The extended ICA algorithm does not need to calculate the higher order statistics, converges fast, and can be used to separate subgaussian and supergaussain sources. A pre-whitening procedure is performed to de-correlate the mixed signals before extracting sources. The experimental results indicate the electromyograpm (EMG) and electrocardiograh (ECG) artifacts in electroencephalograph (EEC) can be removed by a combination of wavelet threshold de-noising and ICA.
