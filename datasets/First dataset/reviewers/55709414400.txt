33947576996	Biological nitrogen removal with real-time control using step-feed SBR technology	The step-feed sequencing batch reactor (SBR), a novel operation mode of SBR, was used for the study of nitrogen removal from real municipal wastewater. The process had achieved advanced and enhanced nitrogen removal by three phases of consecutive aerobic and anoxic periods and also three steps of feeding, combined with real-time control. The control strategies utilized pH and oxidation reduction potential (ORP) as on-line control parameters, especially the derivative of pH, which can flexibly control the durations of aerobic and anoxic phases.

34047204685	Characteristics of the pulsed SBR for advanced nitrogen removal of municipal wastewater	The pulsed SBR, a novel technique was adopted to test the advanced nitrogen removal with real municipal wastewater. The influence of feed frequency and amount on the operational characteristics of pulse SBR technique was studied theoretically and the nitrogen removal efficiency formula was obtained; and the practical influence of these factors on the process operation was studied through test. Theoretical studies showed that under the condition without adding external carbon source, the nitrogen removal efficiency increased with increasing feed frequency. The feed modes would be divided as increasing feed, equal feed and decreasing feed based on the influent C/N ratio. The experiments showed that decreasing feed mode could achieve advanced nitrogen removal when organic carbon in the influent was sufficient with less external carbon source required than that of equal feed model. With increasing feed frequency, the external carbon source dosage decreased; but the operation became complex, 3 step of equal feed mode was recommended for common municipal waste water. Adopting the pulsed SBR only requiring small amount of external carbon source, the effluent TN of municipal waste water could be less than 2mg/L after treating, the TN removal efficiency reached 97.3%.

34548452779	Biological removal of nitrogen from wastewater	The removal of ammonia from wastewater has become a worldwide emerging concern because ammonia is toxic to aquatic species and causes eutrophication in natural water environments (Tchobanoglous et al. 2003). Nitrogen compounds in wastewater can only be effectively removed by biological approaches (EPA 1993; Zhu et al. 2007a,b). Based on the microbial nitrogen cycle and the metabolism of inorganic nitrogen compounds (Fig. 1), many biological technologies and processes have been developed and implemented for nitrogen removal from wastewater, such as predenitrification (Anoxic/Oxic), modified Bardenpho, Bio-denitro, sequencing batch reactor (SBR), oxidation ditch (OD), step feeding, anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic (A

The pulsed SBR, a novel operational mode of SBR, was utilized to treat real municipal wastewater accompanied with adding ethanol as external carbon source. It was observed that the bending-point (apex and knee) of pH and ORP profiles can be used to control denitrification process at a low influent C/N ratio while dpH/dt can be used to control the nitrification and denitrification process at a high influent C/N ratio. The experimental results demonstrated that the effluent total nitrogen can be reduced to lower than 2 mg/L, and the average total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency was higher than 98% by using real-time controll strategy. © 2007 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag.

79951556944	Collaborative RFID intrusion detection with an artificial immune system	The current RFID systems are fragile to external attacks, due to the limitations of encryption authentication and physical protection methods used in implementation of RFID security systems. In this paper, we propose a collaborative RFID intrusion detection method that is based on an artificial immune system (AIS). The new method can enhance the security of RFID systems without need to amend the existing technical standards of RFID. Mimicking the immune cell collaboration in biological immune systems, RFID operations are defined as self and nonself antigens, representing legal and illegal RFID operations, respectively. Data models are defined for antigens' epitopes. Known RFID attacks are defined as danger signals represented by nonself antigens. We propose a method to collect RFID data for antigens and danger signals. With the antigen and danger signal data available, we use a negative selection algorithm to generate adaptive detectors for self antigens as RFID legal operations. We use an immune based clustering algorithm aiNet to generate collaborative detectors for danger signals of RFID intrusions. Simulation results have shown that the new RFID intrusion detection method has effectively reduced the false detection rate. The detection rate on known types of attacks was 98% and the detection rate on unknown type of attacks was 93%. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

80052229067	Effluent organic matter in Beijing's WWTPs: Characterization and comparison	Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in sewage effluents from Beijing's wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were characterized and compared. Results revealed that the characteristics of DOM in sewage effluents were related to the nitrification degree, sewage property and the adopted technology of WWTPs. Good nitrification contributed to the degradation of effluent organic matter and increase the humification degree of effluent. The physical entrapment effect of membrane biological reactor (MBR) as well as its longer sludge retention time decreased the humification degree of effluent, while a portion of organic matters with high molecular weight were still retained. Aerobic biofilm with a longer sludge retention time might induce the aggregation of protein-like soluble microbial products. Comparing with municipal domestic sewage, the characteristics of DOM from WWTP feeding with domestic and industrial mixed sewage displayed obvious differences. © 2011 IEEE.

The effect of the compatibilizer loading on the curing characteristics, mechanical properties, heat aging properties and oil resistance was investigated. Dynamic mechanical analysis indicates that FKM-g-VTEO acts as a compatibilizer in the FKM/MVQ blends. The tensile properties and oil resistance of FKM/MVQ blends increase with the increasing loading of FKM-g-VTEO up to 9 phr and the heat aging properties increase with the addition of the compatibilizer up to 6 phr. The fracture surfaces of tensile samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM of the tensile fracture surface of the blends and rubber-filler interaction studies shows that the presence of FKM-g-VTEO enhances the interfacial interaction of fumed silica and rubber matrix. © The Author(s) 2012.

84887443406	Pathways and organisms involved in ammonia oxidation and nitrous oxide emission	Ammonia oxidation is a central step in the global nitrogen cycle that involves several different-conditions and metabolic bioprocesses, including aerobic versus anaerobic ammonia oxidation, and autotrophic versus heterotrophic ammonia oxidation. With the development and application of metagenomics and other modern molecular approaches, some new organisms (particularly ammonia-oxidizing archaea) and novel pathways related to ammonia oxidation have been identified. Consequently, the understanding of nitrogen cycling processes and themicroorganisms that mediate them have been greatly improved. Here the authors summarize the biochemistry, microbiology, and ecophysiology of these organisms (including autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria, anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, and ammonia-oxidizing archaea) and discuss the current knowledge and important concepts associated with their corresponding pathways. Factors influencing their distribution, abundance, community structure and potential ammonia oxidation rates in natural and engineered ecosystems are also addressed. Furthermore, the mechanism of nitrous oxide emission during these processes and the specific control strategies are explained or proposed. The significant roles of these organisms in novel biological wastewater treatment processes are also evaluated. Finally, several urgent issues and significant perspectives related to these novel pathways and players have been addressed to evoke the involvement of researchers in broadening future studies. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

53549130285	Theoretical analysis and enhanced nitrogen removal performance of step-feed SBR	To achieve high nitrification and denitrification rates, step-feed SBR with multiple aerobic and anoxic phases was adopted to study nitrogen removal performance. Theoretical analysis of step-feed SBR was presented first, from which feeding steps and C/N ratio had significant influences on nitrogen removal performance. Total nitrogen removal efficiency would increase with increasing of feeding steps, while the increasing extent was not distinct with feeding steps above 4. At a given feeding step, nitrogen removal efficiency would also increase with increasing of C/N ratio. Experimental work was conducted in a lab-scale SBR to investigate practical effects of these critical factors, using real municipal wastewater. The results showed when C/N ratio was appropriately decreasing influent flow mode could achieve enhanced nitrogen removal with less adding of external carbon source, compared with equal influent flow mode. Three-step equal influent flow mode was recommended to treat common municipal wastewater in view of operation complexity. Non steady-state experiments over about three months confirmed step-feed SBR was an enhanced nitrogen removal process with high efficiency. Total nitrogen in the effluent was under 2 mg/L, the average removal efficiency achieved for TN was over 97% just adding a little external carbon source, and good sludge settleability was obtained. © IWA Publishing 2008.

In the past few years, the understanding of nitrogen cycling processes has changed dramatically based on some new processes, including heterotrophic nitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation ( Anammox) and archaeal ammonia oxidation. In this review, the discovery, biochemistry mechanism and molecular biology of organisms linked to these processes are presented and relevant unknown questions are highlighted.

In addition, the paper presents some new perspectives about the application of these new organisms in biological nitrogen removal from wastewater. These new perspectives include enriching heterotrophic nitrification bacteria to enhance simultaneous nitrification-denitrification, enriching Anammox to achieve single-stage autotrophic nitrogen removal and enriching ammonia oxidation archaea to improve nitrogen removal efficiency at low dissolved oxygen (DO).

56549117952	Biological nitrogen removal with nitrification and denitrification via nitrite pathway	The efficiency of wastewater treatment practices can be significantly improved through the introduction of new microbial treatment technologies. In order to meet increasing stringent discharge standards, new applications and control strategies for the sustainable removal of ammonium from wastewater have to be implemented. Partial nitrification to nitrite was reported to be technically feasible and economically favorable, especially when the wastewater with high ammonium concentrations or low C/N ratios was treated. For successful implementation of the technology, the critical point is how to maintain the partial nitrification of ammonium to nitrite. Nitritation can be obtained by selectively inhibiting the nitrite oxidizing bacteria through appropriate regulation of the system's DO concentration, microbial SRT, pH, temperature, substrate load, operational and aeration pattern, inhibitor and so on. This review addresses the microbiology, its consequences for application, the current status regarding application, and its future developments.

58149098955	Energy saving achieved by limited filamentous bulking under low dissolved oxygen: Derivation, originality and theoretical basis	How to prevent and control filamentous bulking sludge has being a research focus and attracted much attention. To date despite the extensive research that has been done on bulking sludge, filamentous bulking still occurs world-wide and a comprehensive solution does not seem to be available. Particularly, there are few studies about making use of the characteristics of filamentous bacteria and achieving energy saving by filamentous bulking. Limited filamentous bulking, a novel method for energy saving while equal or better treatment performance by allowing slight and controlled filamentous bulking sludge at low dissolved oxygen (DO), was proposed based on full-scale field observations. The practical operation showed that limited filamentous bulking resulted from a decline in DO concentration. COD, SS and TP removal could be enhanced and energy saving could be achieved by limited filamentous bulking at low DO. The derivation of limited filamentous bulking is introduced firstly, and then the theoretical fundamentals of the technique of limited filamentous bulking are presented and analyzed, including the occurrence of limited filamentous bulking caused by low DO, the enhanced effect of filamentous bacteria on pollutants removal and the energy saving mechanism by using limited filamentous bulking. Besides, the paper provides some new perspectives about the application and research direction of limited filamentous bulking in future.

The results showed that SVI could be maintained 150-230 mL/g and sludge settleability would not become very poor under the condition of low DO. During the period of limited filamentous bulking, COD and total nitrogen removal efficiencies were improved, and distinct simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) was achieved, while ammonia removal efficiency would slightly decline with decreasing of DO, compared with the period of good settleability sludge under high DO. COD, ammonia and total nitrogen removal efficiencies were 86%, 70% and 63%, respectively. It was found that about 10%-25% nitrogen would be removed by SND based on the mass balance of nitrogen. Besides, SS in the effluent was almost negligible and the effluent turbidity was lower than 3 NTU. Significantly, aeration consumptions would be decreased by 17% under the condition with DO of 0.5 mg/L compared with 2.0 mg/L according to theoretical calculation of air requirements to keep different DO levels, which was about 57% in lab-scale reactor correspondingly.

61549116245	Long-term effect of dissolved oxygen on partial nitrification performance and microbial community structure	In this study, the performance of partial nitrification via nitrite and microbial community structure were investigated and compared in two sequencing batch reactors (SBR) with different dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. Both reactors achieved stable partial nitrification with nitrite accumulation ratio of above 95% by using real-time aeration duration control. Compared with high DO (above 3 mg/l on average) SBR, simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) via nitrite was carried out in low DO (0.4-0.8 mg/l) SBR. The average efficiencies of SND in high DO and low DO reactor were 7.7% and 44.9%, and the specific SND rates were 0.20 and 0.83 mg N/(mg MLSS h), respectively. Low DO did not produce sludge with poorer settling properties but attained lower turbidities of the effluent than high DO. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in both the reactors showed that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were the dominant nitrifying bacteria and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) did not be recovered in spite of exposing nitrifying sludge to high DO. The morphology of the sludge from both two reactors according to scanning electron microscope indicated that small rod-shaped and spherical clusters were dominant, although filamentous bacteria and few long rod-shaped coexisted in the low DO reactor. By selecting properly DO level and adopting process control method is not only of benefit to the achievement of novel biological nitrogen removal technology, but also favorable to sludge population optimization.

67650214711	Effective and robust partial nitrification to nitrite by real-time aeration duration control in an SBR treating domestic wastewater	Achieving sustainable partial nitrification to nitrite has been proven difficult in treating low strength nitrogenous wastewater. Real-time aeration duration control was used to achieve efficient partial nitrification to nitrite in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) to treat low strength domestic wastewater. Above 90% nitrite accumulation ratio was maintained for long-term operation at normal condition, or even lower water temperature in winter. Partial nitrification established by controlling aeration duration showed good performance and robustness even though encountering long-term extended aeration and starvation period. Process control enhanced the successful accumulation of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and washout of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Scanning electron microscope observations indicated that the microbial morphology showed a shift towards small rod-shaped clusters. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results demonstrated AOB were the dominant nitrifying bacteria, up to 8.3 ± 1.1% of the total bacteria; on the contrary, the density of NOB decreased to be negligible after 135 days operation since adopting process control. © 2009.

70149099527	A new design of tooth profiles increases synchronous belt's fatigue life	Synchronous belt and its driving pulley have non-conjugate tooth profiles. Because of non-conjugate motion and polygon effect, interference occurs during incomplete meshing, resulting in excessive wear and tear at tooth-root, which are the main forms of failure of synchronous belts. Tooth cracking also results from uneven stress distribution and/or increased maximal stress. In addition to discovering better materials to increase the strength of the belt's teeth, optimization of the geometry of tooth profiles of belt and pulley to decrease the maximum tooth-root stress and to reduce interference during meshing is critical in improving the carrying capacity and increasing the belt's life span. In the present study we proposed a new design of synchronous belt's and pulley's tooth profiles, modifying several key geometric parameters commonly used in synchronous belts' designs. Applying the conformai mapping function and the theory of plane elasticity we systemically investigated the distribution of stress and distortion at the belt's and pulley's teeth of varying geometric parameters and analyzed the interference during meshing using an approach to investigating tooth profiles of non-constant pitch diameter. Finite Element Analysis showed that with the same load the maximum principal stress values of belt teeth in complete meshing in our design (STSB) were 54.4% and 67.8% of that of HTD (by Uniroyal) and STPD (by Good Year) belts with an 8 mm pitch commonly used in automobiles, respectively. The uneven distribution of stress along the edge of tooth profile was reduced, and the interference during meshing minimized with our design. We then experimentally tested belts made of the same materials with the three designs manufactured by the same factory. The belts were tested in the enclosed type of testing machine for synchronous belt's fatigue-life, power = 6.5 kW and speed = 1500 r/min with test belt tension at 400 N. The fatigue lives of the belts (n=5 each group) were 988±36, 439±21 and 665±22 hours (mean ± SD) for STSB, HTD and STPD belts (p<0.0001), respectively, demonstrating the superiority of our design. We anticipate that the new design will have wide applications not limited to the automobile industry. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.

70350537057	Partial nitrification via nitrite at ordinary and low temperatures in an SBR treating domestic wastewater	Through real-time aeration duration control, partial nitrification was carried out in a lab-scale SBR at normal temperatures and maintained for a long time even at low temperatures. The specific ammonia oxidation rate would be reduced with decrease of the temperature. The average specific ammonia oxidation rate at 27°C was 1.68 times of that at 13°C. The temperature coefficient of ammonia oxidation reaction in the reactor was ascertained 1.501 according to the Arrhenius expression. When nitrite accumulation ratio was steadily kept over 90%, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to detect the sludge population structure, which showed the proportion of the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) was 8%~9% and lower than 0.5%, respectively. The real-time control strategy had a positive effect on the enrichment of AOB and the limitation or wash-out of NOB. An advisable start up strategy to operate a partial nitrification system at low temperatures could have two steps, obtaining firstly the selective enrichment of AOB as well as the washout of NOB by real-time aeration duration control under ordinary temperatures, and then making the biomass slowly adapt to low temperatures.

This method for energy saving was derived from two full-scale field observations, which showed pollutants removal would be enhanced and energy consumption could be reduced by atleast 10% using limited filamentous bulking. Furthermore, preliminary investigation including the abundance evaluation and the identification of filamentous bacteria demonstrated that the limited filamentous bulking could be repeated steadily in a lab-scale anoxic-oxic reactor fed with domestic wastewater. The sludge loss did not occur in the secondary clarifier, while COD and total nitrogen removal efficiencies were improved by controlling DO for optimal filamentous bacterial population. Suspended solids in effluent were negligible and turbidity was lower than 2 NTU, which were distinctly lower than those under no bulking. Theoretical and experimental results indicated the aeration consumption could be saved by the application of limited filamentous bulking. © 2009.

77649222923	Efficient and integrated start-up strategy for partial nitrification to nitrite treating low C/N domestic wastewater	Nitrogen removal via the nitrite pathway has the potential of reducing the requirements for aeration consumption and carbon source. However, the development of an efficient and quick start-up strategy for partial nitrification to nitrite has proven difficult in the treatment of low strength wastewater. In this study, the feasibility of partial nitrification achieved by using real-time aeration duration control was not only demonstrated from the kinetic mechanism, but also was validated in three sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) fed with low C/N domestic wastewater. Nitrite accumulation could be achieved when aeration was terminated as soon as an inflexion pH point was reached (the dpH/dt became from negative to positive). The reduction or limitation of the NOB growth could be achieved through aeration duration control, due to leaving no extra time for NOB to convert the accumulated nitrite. The experimental operation results also showed that partial nitrification with nitrite accumulation ratios of over 80% was achieved successfully in these three reactors with process control. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis indicated the reduction of NOB was achieved and AOB became the dominant nitrifying bacteria. Moreover, an integrated start-up strategy based on aeration duration control was proposed to quickly achieve partial nitrification to nitrite. © IWA Publishing 2009.

In this study, the long-term effects of temperature on partial nitrification were investigated by operating a sequencing bath reactor with the use of aeration duration control. The specific ammonia oxidation rate decreased by 1.5 times with the temperature decreasing from 25 to 15°C. However, low temperature did not deteriorate the stable partial nitrification performance. Nitrite accumulation ratio was always above 90%, even slightly higher (above 95%) at low temperatures. The nitrifying sludge accumulated with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), but washout of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) was used to determine the short-term effects of temperature on ammonia oxidation process.

It combined University of Cape Town (UCT) and step feed process. Effects of inflow distribution ratios and nutrients ratios were investigated. The highest removal efficiencies of 89% for chemical oxygen demanding (COD), 88% for total nitrogen (TN) and 93% for phosphorus were obtained, respectively, at the inflow distribution ratio of 40:30:30%. The phosphorus removal exhibited an upward trend with the increasing of influent COD/P and TN/P, and the nitrogen removal had a positive correlation with influent COD/TN. In addition, aerobic simultaneous nitrification and denitrification and anoxic denitrifying phosphorus uptake made a distinct contribution to enhance nutrient removal. The proposed system was demonstrated to be an attractive enhanced biological nutrient removal process for wastewater treatment plants due to relatively high nutrient removal, robust sludge settleability and energy savings. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77956383230	Short-term and long-term effects of DO on the partial nitrification process in an SBR reactor	The performance of partial nitrification via nitrite and microbial community structure were investigated and compared in an SBR by operating under different DO conditions. The reactor achieved stable partial nitrification with nitrite accumulation ratio of above 90% both at high and low DO concentrations by using the real-time aeration duration control. Compared with high DO (ρ(DO)=3±0.5 mg/L), distinct simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) via nitrite was carried out at low DO (ρ(DO)=0.5±0.1 mg/L) despite with lower ammonia oxidation rate. The average efficiency of SND at high DO and low DO concentrations was 9.5% and 45.4%, respectively. The maximum SND efficiency reached 86% under low DO concentration. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed that AOB (ammonia oxidizing bacteria) became the dominant nitrifying bacteria and NOB (nitrite oxidizing bacteria) was gradually washed out from the reactor when stable nitrite accumulation was established. The sizes of AOB and NOB were 8~10% and lower than 0.5% at the end of high DO operation period, respectively. After the operation under low DO, AOB gradually increased to 10~12% but NOB decreased into negligible level. It can be concluded that the real-time aeration duration control has positive effect on the sludge population optimization under both high and low DO conditions. Keeping DO at a low level is not only beneficial to the wash-out of NOB and the increasing of nitrite accumulation ratio, but also favorable to the enhancement of SND efficiency.

The results indicated that the feeding length had insignificant influence on biochemical storage under anoxic conditions. The storage levels of PHA were decreased slightly with gradual increasing of feeding length from 10min to 60 min, 90 min and 120 min. The maximum difference was 0.21 mmolC/L and the f

77956492057	Assessment of partial nitrification achieved by real-time aeration duration control through microbial population shift using FISH and SEM	The shift of nitrifier population within a partial nitrification reactor was investigated using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) techniques and the floc morphology was observed using scan electron microscope (SEM). Partial nitrification to nitrite was achieved quickly by using real-time aeration duration control when domestic wastewater was treated in a lab-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The average nitrite accumulation ratio was above 93%. The morphology photographs observed using SEM indicated that the sludge showed a shift towards spherical and small rod-shaped clusters from the diverse morphology. FISH analysis showed that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) gradually out-competed nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). AOB population percentage increased from 3.5% (during the start-up period) to 8.5% (after achieving nitritation for 102 days), while NOB population percentage decreased from 3.1% to less than 0.5%. Accordingly, the long-term operation with the use of real-time aeration duration control was not only favorable for AOB community optimisation, but also for the achievement of partial nitrification in practice.

78650143205	Compatibilization of fluororubber/ silicone rubber blends by the incorporation of 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate grafted silicone rubber	The blends of fluororubber (FKM) and silicone rubber (MVQ) were prepared by the incorporation of fumed silica at different contents using 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate grafted silicone rubber (MVQ-g-TFEMA) as a compatibilizer. The effect of the compatibilizer content on the curing characteristics, crosslink density, mechanical properties, heat aging properties, oil resistance, and low temperature properties were investigated. The effect of fumed silica content on the mechanical properties of FKM/MVQ blends in the presence of MVQ-g-TFEMA was also studied. The dynamic mechanical analysis indicates that MVQ-g-TFEMA acts as a compatibilizer in the FKM/MVQ blends. The mechanical properties and oil resistance of FKM/MVQ blends increase with the increasing of MVQ-g-TFEMA content up to 6 phr and the heat aging properties increase with the addition of the compatibilizer. Rubber-filler interactions in the blends increase with the increasing of the compatibilizer content. Rubber-filler interaction studies show that the presence of MVQ-g-TFEMA enhances the interfacial interaction of fumed silica and rubber matrix. The tear strength and hardness increase by the incorporation of fumed silica, and the tensile strength and elongation at break increase with the addition of the fumed silica up to 30 phr in the presence of 6 phr MVQ-g-TFEMA. © 2010 The Author(s).

79953063295	Spatial distribution of dynamics characteristic in the intermittent aeration static composting of sewage sludge	Spatial differences and temporal changes in biological activity characteristics were investigated in a static reactor using intermittent aeration during the sewage sludge composting process. Pumice was proposed as a bulking agent in the composting of sewage sludge. Variations in temperature, moisture, oxygen level, volatile solids, specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) were determined during 28. days of composting. The peak temperature in the upper region of the reactor was 10 °C higher than that at the bottom. The moisture level in the middle region was significantly higher than that of other positions. Analysis of SOUR and DHA indicated that the lowest level of sludge stability was at the bottom region. These spatial and temporal differences in biochemical dynamics in the static system could extend the composting period and affect product uniformity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the technique, the injected working fluid was first frozen; next, degassing was done by rapidly pumping the pressure down to below 110 Pa; and finally, the micro heat pipe was crimping sealed, followed by secondary degassing and crimping sealing. The field tests on industrial scale show that the micro heat pipe with sintered wick fabricated with the newly-developed technique outperforms that produced in the conventional method. For example, the pumping time is reduced by 2/3, and its thermal conductivity and quantity of the working fluid better satisfy the stringent requirements.

DOM in effluents from an artificial wastewater, a landfill leachate, a saline wastewater, and DOM collected from surface water were also tested for comparison. As for pilot WWTPs operating with the same actual wastewater feed, the DOM transformation was comparable: low MW (< 500 Da) and middle MW (> 5000 Da) organic materials decreased, while humic-like substances with MW of 650. Da, 1700. Da and 2000. Da and large MW organic materials (SMPs) with MW > 10,000. Da were aggregated. DOM in effluents from different sewage displayed their own characteristic SEC chromatograms.

80051821015	Feasibility study for limited filamentous bulking under low dissolved oxygen at different operation regimes	Limited filamentous bulking under low dissolved oxygen (DO) is a new technology for energy saving and high quality effluent. In order to investigate the feasibility of this technology, four sequence batch reactors (SBRs) were occupied to operate at different regimes to stimulate different processes under low DO (0.5 mg/L). Sludge settleability, floc structure, pollutant removal and aerated energy consumption were investigated. The results showed that limited filamentous bulking under low DO was hard to realize in the single-stage aerobic reactors for they were prone to bulking severely, while it could be achieved stably in the pre-denitrification reactors when the feed length was between 60 and 90 minutes. Compared with normal sludge at the same DO, limited filamentous bulking sludge acquired by low DO displayed its high energy-saving effect. In addition, the specific ammonia consumption rate of limited filamentous bulking sludge was about 2 times higher than the one of normal sludge. On the contrary, the total nitrogen removal efficiency was lower. Further analysis indicated that stable limited sludge bulking could be achieved in a good alternative anoxic/anaerobic/aerobic condition without too high organic loading.

80052841429	Mechanisms of synchronous belt tooth failure due to fatigue shear fracture	Conformal mapping with complex function based on plane elasticity mechanics is an analytical method for resolving stress and displacement at any point of a half-plane domain. Using complex function conformal mapping method in this article we investigated the relationship between load on tooth surface and maximum stress at tooth root for calculating the maximum compressive stress on the opposite side of working flank and maximum tensile stress on working flank side when loads are applied to tooth top and root of working flank side, respectively. The maximum tensile and compressive stress at the tooth root are the main forces that cause fatigue cracking of the tooth root, which may extend along the elastomer compound-cord interface resulting in shear cracking of the belt tooth. The results of our calculation reveal the mechanisms whereby tooth shear cracking causes fatigue failure of synchronic belt, which are consistent with the experimental research results of Lizuka. © 2011 Trans Tech Publications.

Two operating parameters of the ferment, stirring speed and ventilation were determined. The results showed that, under the identical KLa with flasks, the stirring speed and ventilation were 50 r/min and 700 L/h, 100 r/min and 600 L/h, or 150 r/min and 500 L/h in 10 L fermentor; And the stirring speed and ventilation were 100r/min and 3 m3/h or 150 r/min and 2 m3/h in 100 L fermentor. In the experiments, the stirring speed and ventilation were 100 r/min and 600 L/h in 10 L fermentor; the stirring speed was 250 r/min and ventilation was 2 m3/h in 100 L fermentor, the results were consistent with the optimized conditions in flasks, and the production of both fibrinolytic enzyme and mycelia reached the optimized results in flasks.

As for the printed circuit board (PCB) assembly of electronic components through surface mounting technology (SMT), high-pixel charge coupled device (CCD) can only screen local images during image collection because of its limited vision. A rapid image mosaic technology has been proposed to seamlessly stitch the local images with overlapping boundaries. The complete image of PCB assembly has been acquired through rapid area matching method within double Mark points and Mark circle. The experiment results show that this method can greatly reduce the image-mosaic time and fairly improve the real-time performance of modern automatic optical inspection (AOI) equipment. Furthermore, such method avoids the alignment error from the characteristic points for noise jamming or noise shielding, and therefore obtains better robustness. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

82955195932	Stable limited filamentous bulking through keeping the competition between floc-formers and filaments in balance	Limited filamentous bulking (LFB) was proposed to save aeration energy consumption and enhance the capacity of filaments to degrade substrates with low concentrations in activated sludge systems. Operational parameters favorable for maintaining the LFB state were investigated in an anoxic-oxic reactor treating domestic wastewater. The experiments showed that the LFB state would deteriorate with sharply decreasing temperature, reducing substrate gradients or removing anoxic zones. The balance between filaments and floc-formers could be achieved by controlling dissolved oxygen and sludge loading rates to be in optimal ranges. Eikelboom Type 0041 and Candidatus Microthrix parvicella were the filamentous bacteria responsible for the LFB state. However, the excess growth of Eikelboom Type 021N and Sphaerotilus natans were observed when serious bulking occurred under low substrate gradients.

84857905951	Characterization of the dissolved organic matter in sewage effluent of sequence batch reactor: The impact of carbon source	Dissolved organic matter (DOM) transformation in sequence batch reactor (SBR) fed with carbon sources of different biodegradability was investigated. During the biologic degradation process, the low molecular weight (MW) fraction (< 1 kDa) gradually decreased, while the refractory compounds with higher aromaticity were aggregated. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and fluorescence of excitation emission matrices (EEM) demonstrated that more biopolymers (polysaccharides or proteins) and humic-like substances were presented in the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) extracted from the SBR fed with sodium acetate or glucose, while the EPS from SBR fed with slowly biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) substratestarch had relatively less biopolymers. Comparing the EfOM in sewage effluent of three SBRs, the effluent from SBR fed with starch is more aromatic. Organic carbon with MW >1 kDa as well as the hydrophobic fraction in DOM gradually increased with the carbon sources changing from sodium acetate to glucose and starch. The DOC fractionation and the EEM all demonstrated that EfOM from the effluent of the SBR fed with starch contained more fulvic acid-like substances comparing with the SBR fed with sodium acetate and glucose. © 2011 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Partial nitrification to nitrite was achieved and maintained in a lab-scale completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) treating real domestic wastewater. During the start-up period, sludge with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) but no nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) was obtained by batch operation with aeration time control. The nitrifying sludge with the dominance of AOB was then directly switched into continuous operation. It was demonstrated that partial nitrification to nitrite in the continuous system could be repeatedly and reliably achieved using this start-up strategy. The ratio of dissolved oxygen to ammonium loading rate (DO/ALR) was critical to maintain high ammonium removal efficiency and nitrite accumulation ratio.

The rheometric study showed that optimum cure properties were obtained using the curing system of dicumyl peroxide (DCP) and triallylisocyanurate (TAIC). From varying the curing agents, the optimum levels of DCP and TAIC were found to be 2.0 phr and 1.5 phr, respectively. The addition of different fillers and their loading influenced the cure behaviors, with increased torque and scorch time compared with that of gum blends. The filled 50:50 (w/w) MVQ-FKM blends showed overall performance in mechanical properties. Post-curing improved the strength of MVQ-FKM blends, especially the blends with a higher proportion of FKM. Swelling of the blends was reduced with the addition of fillers and the increased incorporation of FKM. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed two tan δ peaks corresponding to MVQ and FKM phase for filled blends, respectively.

84866144286	A negative selection algorithm integrated with immune network theory	Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) is an artificial immune system for anomaly detection. Three weaknesses in NSA are the exponential cost of generating detectors, the difficulty to set the matching threshold, and the deviation between the real and the expected miss detection rate. To improve these weaknesses, a new Negative Selection Algorithm Integrated with Immune Network theory (NSA-IN) was proposed. A matching rule with variable threshold was defined, and clonal selection was adopted to rapidly mature the detectors with low similarity to self bodies and self-adaptively get the matching threshold of detectors, and immune network theory was adopted to optimize the distribution of mature detectors and improve detection rate. Experiments show that, NSA-IN can automatically set the matching threshold, and is the linear cost of generating detectors, and reduces the deviation between the real and the expected miss detection rate. In RFID anomaly detection case, the average miss detection rate of NSA-IN is 0.098, and is lower than that of NSA 0.234. © 2012 IEEE.

84868304367	Control filamentous bulking caused by chlorine-resistant Type 021N bacteria through adding a biocide CTAB	Filamentous bulking sludge due to excessive growth of filamentous bacteria is a serious operational problem in activated sludge plants. The addition of chemicals is one of widespread ways to control filamentous bulking. In this study, filamentous bulking in a continuous activated sludge system was found to be mainly caused by Eikelboom Type 021N filamentous bacteria likely due to low substrate concentration gradients. These Type 021N bacteria were found to be resistant to chlorination, maintaining cell integrity at a dosage of up to 80 mg Cl/gSS. An alternative biocidal agent, cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), exhibited a much stronger biocidal effect on these filaments, which significantly improved sludge settleability. Type 021N with filamentous index of 5 was selectively killed, but floc-formers recovery their activity after CTAB termination. The study implied that CTAB might have more penetration capacity to cell wall of chlorine-resistant Type 021N bacteria. We therefore suggest the penetration property of filament cell wall should be considered or tested before the selection of biocide type in practice. © 2012.

Then, the nano-silica/ fluorinated polyacrylate composite latexes were prepared via emulsion polymerization directly using the in situ generated nano-silica dispersion as seeds. Dodecafluoroheptyl methacrylate (DFHMA) as functional monomer was incorporated into shell layer of the composite particles by semi-continuous starved condition at the second stage. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that silica was generated in situ and DFHMA took part in the copolymerization. Transmission electron microscopy showed uniform composite latex particle morphology and obvious core-shell structure. Dynamic light scattering demonstrated that DNS-86 could control the composite latex particle size ranging from 90 to 180 nm. DFHMA had an important effect on the particle size. Zeta potential (ζ) revealed that the composite latex had good stability. The resulted composite films were characterized by angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact angle measurements and thermo-gravimetric analysis. The well-tailored composite latex particle structure of nano-silica core and fluorinated polyacrylate can effectively improve the hydrophobicity of the resultant films. Water contact angle could reach 123.5 when 6 wt% DFHMA was incorporated in the film. Moreover, water contact angles remained 106 after water immersion in the range of the experimental sample films. In addition, the incorporation of fluorinated monomer and nano-silica contributed to the improvement of thermal stability of the composite film. © 2013 Iran Polymer and Petrochemical Institute.

84904250637	Effects of feeding pattern and dissolved oxygen concentration on microbial morphology and community structure: The competition between floc-forming bacteria and filamentous bacteria	Understanding of the competition between floc-formers and filaments is critical to prevent filamentous bulking in practice. This study aimed to investigate the effects of feeding pattern and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration on their competition in four sequencing batch reactors (SBRs). Short feeding under anoxic condition (fill time. <. 10. min) resulted in a well-settling sludge (sludge volume index (SVI). <. 100. mL/g), in spite of DO concentrations. Sludge settleability deteriorated (SVI. >. 200. mL/g) and filamentous bulking was observed when the substrate was added in a limiting rate by prolonging the anoxic fill time up to 90. min. In contrast, sludge settleability in fully aerobic systems was quite poor (SVI. >. 500. mL/g) in spite of the feeding length. Compared to the systems with an anoxic fill phase, more types and abundant filamentous bacteria were identified in fully aerobic systems. Microscopic observation, staining reactions and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis indicated that the extensive filaments, including Thiothrix nivea, Type 021N, Type 1851 and Microthrix parvicella, proliferated in fully aerobic systems. The results of this study indicated that substrate gradients played an important role on the competition between filaments and floc-formers.

In this work, the long-term effects of N and P limitation or deficiency on sludge settleability and bioflocculation characteristics were investigated in six sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) fed with wastewater with different nutrient availability. The sludge volume index (SVI), microbial community structures, intracellular poly-β-hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were characterised over time. Bulking was not observed in SBRs with N limitation or deficiency, in which SVI remained below 150. mL/g. In contrast, bulking was encountered in those reactors with P deficiency. The occurrence of non-filamentous bulking was associated with a higher carbohydrates fraction and a lower proteins fraction in EPS. In the case of filamentous bulking, SVI correlated negatively with the amount of PHAs. Our experimental data support the hypothesis that the occurrence and/or the type of bulking in activated sludge could be affected by the combination of kinetic selection, microbial storage, as well as the EPS composition. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84905841523	Double helical synchronous belt transmission design	The meshing impact noise caused by the gradually engagement between double helical synchronous belt and the pulley was reduced due to its spiral angle effect. Therefore, double helical synchronous belt transmission receives much concern with its excellent characteristics of de-noising, low transmission error and high carrying capacity. The profiles of synchronous belt and belt pulley were studied based on conjugate-curvature high degree contact meshing theory under the circumstance that the pitch of belt and belt pulley are identical. The higher contact strength of the belt teeth and a smaller clearance in the contact point adjacent area were ensured with Hertz contact theory as the synchronous belt is in contact with pulley. And then a conjugated arc tooth profile with two-step contact and three-step adjacent gap infinitesimal was proposed based on the simple easy to processing method, which was adopted as main parameters for double synchronous belt and pulley's normal teeth profile. The three-dimensional transmission model was built and the static nonlinear contact analysis was done with finite element software ANSYS. Finally, the noise experiment was conducted on the high speed test bench to compare the noise reduction effect between double helical synchronous belt and straight tooth timing belt with the identical end face profile. The simulation and experiment result show that the double helical synchronous belt transmission can reduce noise level by 11dB approximately compared with straight tooth timing belt transmission. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84922646117	Progress in the self-healing elastomers	Elastomers were used in many engineering fields. Because of effect of static ordynamic tension, compression, shear and torsion, elastomers are prone to produce micro cracks, which will continue growing and expanding, and eventually lead to failure of elastomers or even completely destroy elastomers. It is effective to reduce the premature failure and increase life of elastomers with application of self-healing technology. In recent years, the research of self-healing polymer was extended from composites to elastomers.This paper summarized the molecular structures, properties, self-healing mechanisms and repair efficiency of self-healing elastomers based on supramolecular system, microcapsule system and other self-healing systems.
