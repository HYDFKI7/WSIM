20144389770	Synthetic peptides derived from SARS coronavirus S protein with diagnostic and therapeutic potential	The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an important viral structural protein. Based on bioinformatics analysis, 10 antigenic peptides derived from the S protein sequence were selected and synthesized. The antigenicity and immunoreactivity of all the peptides were tested in vivo and in vitro. Four peptides (P6, P8, P9 and P10) which contain B cell epitopes of the S protein were identified, and P8 peptide was confirmed in vivo to have a potential in serological diagnosis. By using a syncytia formation model, we tested the neutralization ability of all 10 peptides and their corresponding antibodies. It is interesting to find that P8 and P9 peptides inhibited syncytia formation, suggesting that the P8 and P9 spanning regions may provide a good target for anti-SARS-CoV drug design. Our data suggest that we have identified peptides derived from the S protein of SARS-CoV, which are useful for SARS treatment and diagnosis. © 2005 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

23944484215	Analysis and application of SNP and haplotype in the human genome	Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most common type of genetic variant in human genome. Haplotype, defined as a specific set of alleles observed on a single chromosome, or a part of a chromosome, has been an integral part of human genetics for decades. The goal of the international HapMap project is to determine the common patterns of DNA sequence variation and find the Tag SNPs representing all SNPs in the human genome. Some studies demonstrated that the analyses of haplotype defined by the grouping and interaction of several variants rather than any individual SNP correlated with complex phenotypes. Here, we describe the definitions of SNPs, genotype, haplotype and some information of the HapMap project. In this review, we summarize the current three haplotype-inference methods, including Clark' method, EM algorithm and Byes approach, and the different defining methods for haplotype block, as well as the methods for choosing tag SNPs and association studies of complex diseases using haplotype. The major public SNP databases and applications of SNPs and haplotype in common complex diseases and drug response are also introduced in the paper.

24044546509	Refined phylogenetic profiles method for predicting protein-protein interactions	Motivation: The increasing availability of complete genome sequences provides excellent opportunity for the further development of tools for functional studies in proteomics. Several experimental approaches and in silico algorithms have been developed to cluster proteins into networks of biological significance that may provide new biological insights, especially into understanding the functions of many uncharacterized proteins. Among these methods, the phylogenetic profiles method has been widely used to predict protein-protein interactions. It involves the selection of reference organisms and identification of homologous proteins. Up to now, no published report has systematically studied the effects of the reference genome selection and the identification of homologous proteins upon the accuracy of this method. Results: In this study, we optimized the phylogenetic profiles method by integrating phylogenetic relationships among reference organisms and sequence homology information to improve prediction accuracy. Our results revealed that the selection of the reference organisms set and the criteria for homology identification significantly are two critical factors for the prediction accuracy of this method. Our refined phylogenetic profiles method shows greater performance and potentially provides more reliable functional linkages compared with previous methods. © The Author 2005.

26844463047	Computational methods for protein-protein interaction and their application	Protein-protein interactions play a central role in numerous processes in cell and are one of the main research fields in current functional proteomics. The increase of finished genomic sequences has greatly stimulated the progress for detecting the functions of the genes and their encoded proteins. As complementary ways to the high through-put experimental methods, various methods of bioinformatics have been developed for the study of the protein-protein interaction. These methods range from the sequence homology-based to the genomic-context based. Recently, it tends to integrate the data from different methods to build the protein-protein interaction network, and to predict the protein function from the analysis of the network structure. Efforts are ongoing to improve these methods and to search for novel aspects in genomes that could be exploited for function prediction. This review highlights the recent advances of the bioinformatics methods in protein-protein interaction researches. In the end, the application of the protein-protein interaction has also been discussed. © 2005 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

33646165344	A novel domain-based method for predicting the functional classes of proteins	Prediction of protein functions from known genomic sequences is an important mission of bioinformatics. One approach is to classify proteins into functional categories. We have therefore developed a method based on protein domain composition and the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm to classify proteins according to functions. Using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, we compared the effectiveness of the MLE approach with that of an intuitive and simple method. The MLE method outperformed the simple method, achieving an estimated specificity of 75.45% and an estimated sensitivity of 40.26%. These results indicate that domain is an important feature of proteins and is closely related to protein function.

33646510075	Predicting rRNA-, RNA-, and DNA-binding proteins from primary structure with support vector machines	In the post-genome era, the prediction of protein function is one of the most demanding tasks in the study of bioinformatics. Machine learning methods, such as the support vector machines (SVMs), greatly help to improve the classification of protein function. In this work, we integrated SVMs, protein sequence amino acid composition, and associated physicochemical properties into the study of nucleic-acid-binding proteins prediction. We developed the binary classifications for rRNA-, RNA-, DNA-binding proteins that play an important role in the control of many cell processes. Each SVM predicts whether a protein belongs to rRNA-, RNA-, or DNA-binding protein class. Self-consistency and jackknife tests were performed on the protein data sets in which the sequences identity was <25%. Test results show that the accuracies of rRNA-, RNA-, DNA-binding SVMs predictions are ∼84%, ∼78%, ∼72%, respectively. The predictions were also performed on the ambiguous and negative data set. The results demonstrate that the predicted scores of proteins in the ambiguous data set by RNA- and DNA-binding SVM models were distributed around zero, while most proteins in the negative data set were predicted as negative scores by all three SVMs. The score distributions agree well with the prior knowledge of those proteins and show the effectiveness of sequence associated physicochemical properties in the protein function prediction.

33746772726	Demonstration of two novel methods for predicting functional siRNA efficiency	Background: siRNAs are small RNAs that serve as sequence determinants during the gene silencing process called RNA interference (RNAi). It is well know that siRNA efficiency is crucial in the RNAi pathway, and the siRNA efficiency for targeting different sites of a specific gene varies greatly. Therefore, there is high demand for reliable siRNAs prediction tools and for the design methods able to pick up high silencing potential siRNAs. Results: In this paper, two systems have been established for the prediction of functional siRNAs: (1) a statistical model based on sequence information and (2) a machine learning model based on three features of siRNA sequences, namely binary description, thermodynamic profile and nucleotide composition. Both of the two methods show high performance on the two datasets we have constructed for training the model. Conclusion: Both of the two methods studied in this paper emphasize the importance of sequence information for the prediction of functional siRNAs. The way of denoting a bio-sequence by binary system in mathematical language might be helpful in other analysis work associated with fixed-length bio-sequence. © 2006 Jia et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

33748742537	Phenotype-genotype correlation in eight Chinese 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase-deficiency patients with five novel mutations of CYP17A1 gene	Context: P450c17 deficiency (17OHD), caused by mutation in CYP17A1 gene, is characterized by severe hypertension-hypokalemia, sexual infantilism in females, and pseudohermaphroditism in males. We investigated eight Chinese 17OHD patients with five novel mutations of CYP17A1 gene and analyzed phenotype-genotype correlation in a patient with regular menses and seven others with classic presentations by in vitro expression and computer modeling. Objective: The objective of the study was to explore the phenotype-genotype correlation in patients with subtle and classic manifestations. Subjects and Methods: Eight patients with 17OHD from seven families were diagnosed according to clinical manifestations and basal hormone assays. The CYP17A1 gene was amplified and sequenced. Haplotyping analysis was performed to determine a common ancestor for those subjects with a frequent mutation 1517_1525del. In vitro enzymatic activities assay and computer modeling were used to analyze the phenotype-genotype correlation. Results: Five novel CYP17A1 mutations, homozygous D487_F489del (1517_1525del) and F453S, combined compound Y329K and 1047del, P434L and V310_W313del, and R416C and D487_F489del were identified. Haplotyping showed that 1517_1525del might be inherited from a common ancestor. Compared with the mutations in patients with classical manifestations, F453S in the patient with regular menses, occasional hypertension, and hypokalemia showed a partially reduced 17α-hydroxylase (29% of those of wild type) and a minor protein conformational change. Conclusion: The clinical manifestations in patients with 17OHD correlate with CYP17A1 mutations and enzymatic activities by in vitro enzyme assay and computer modeling. F453S mutation results in partially reduced enzymatic activities and a subtle phenotype. The prevalent mutation 1517_1525del in Chinese 17OHD patients might be a founder effect.

33748054795	Insights into the coupling of duplication events and macroevolution from an age profile of animal transmembrane gene families	The evolution of new gene families subsequent to gene duplication may be coupled to the fluctuation of population and environment variables. Based upon that, we presented a systematic analysis of the animal transmembrane gene duplication events on a macroevolutionary scale by integrating the palaeontology repository. The age of duplication events was calculated by maximum likelihood method, and the age distribution was estimated by density histogram and normal kernel density estimation. We showed that the density of the duplicates displays a positive correlation with the estimates of maximum number of cell types of common ancestors, and the oxidation events played a key role in the major transitions of this density trace. Next, we focused on the Phanerozoic phase, during which more macroevolution data are available. The pulse mass extinction timepoints coincide with the local peaks of the age distribution, suggesting that the transmembrane gene duplicates fixed frequently when the environment changed dramatically. Moreover, a 61-million-year cycle is the most possible cycle in this phase by spectral analysis, which is consistent with the cycles recently detected in biodiversity. Our data thus elucidate a strong coupling of duplication events and macroevolution; furthermore, our method also provides a new way to address these questions. © 2006 Ding et al.

33748930075	Comparative analysis of whole-genome sequences of Streptococcus suis	The outbreak of Streptococcus suis recently in some districts of Sichuan Province in China has caused over 30 deaths and over 200 infections in human beings. In order to study the pathogenicity mechanism and to prevent the bacteria from spreading and infecting human beings and swine, we have annotated and analyzed the genomes of two strains, Streptococcus suis P1/7 and 89-1591 respectively. The whole length of P1/7 is 2.007 Mb, and has 1969 ORFs. In contrast, the partial genome sequence of 89-1591 is 1.98 Mb in length and exists in 177 contigs with 1918 ORFs. Analysis shows that the average lengths of CDSs in two genomes are very close, and the numbers of the homolog ORFs are 1306 between those two strains. Most of the toxicity factors of the two strains are homologeous, but there are still some significant differences between those two strains. For example, among the 11 genes (cps2A-cps2K) encoding for the capsules in P1/7, 4 (cps2A, 2B, 2I, 2J) are not detected in strain 89-1591. At the same time, the genes encoding EF and Haemolysin in P1/7 are also not found in strain 89-1591. Besides, the genes related to DNA replication, repair and recombination differ from each other significantly and there also exist certain differences among the surface proteins. Those characteristics indicate that those two strains have evolved their own specific functions to adapt to the different environments and that the pathogenesis of the two strains is different. We have accumulated comprehensive genomics information for future systematic studies of S. sui. Our results are helpful for disease prevention, vaccine development, as well as drug design for S. suis. © Science in China Press 2006.

33748940108	Prediction and systematic study of protein-protein interaction networks of Leptospira interrogans	Leptospira interrogans serovar Lai is a pathogenic bacterium that causes a spirochetal zoonosis in humans and some animals. With its complete genome sequence available, it is possible to analyze protein-protein interactions from a whole-genome standpoint. Here we combine four recently developed computational approaches (gene fusion method, gene neighbor method, phylogenetic profiles method, and operon method) to predict protein-protein interaction networks of Leptospira interrogans strain Lai. Through comprehensive analysis on interactions among proteins of motility and chemotaxis system, signal transduction, lipopolysaccaride biosynthesis and a series of proteins related to adhesion and invasion, we provided information for further studying on its pathogenic mechanism. In addition, we also assigned 203 previously uncharacterized proteins with possible functions based on the known functions of its interacting partners. This work is helpful for further investigating L. interrogans strain Lai. © 2006 Science in China Press.

33750073224	Correlating expression data with gene function using gene ontology	Clustering is perhaps one of the most widely used tools for microarray data analysis. Proposed roles for genes of unknown function are inferred from clusters of genes similarity expressed across many biological conditions. However, whether function annotation by similarity metrics is reliable or not and to what extent the similarity in gene expression patterns is useful for annotation of gene functions, has not been evaluated. This paper made a comprehensive research on the correlation between the similarity of expression data and of gene functions using Gene Ontology. It has been found that although the similarity in expression patterns and the similarity in gene functions are significantly dependent on each other, this association is rather weak. In addition, among the three categories of Gene Ontology, the similarity of expression data is more useful for cellular component annotation than for biological process and molecular function. The results presented are interesting for the gene functions prediction research area. © 2006 SIOC, CAS, & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

33749592743	Analysis and application of large-scale protein-protein interaction data sets	Protein-protein interactions play key roles in cells. Lots of experimental approaches and in silica methods have been developed to identify and predict large-scale protein-protein interactions. However, compared with the traditionally experimental results, the high-throughput protein-protein interaction data often contain the false positives in high probability. In order to fully utilize the large-scale data, it is necessary to develop bioinformatic methods for systematically evaluating those data in order to further improve the data reliability and mine biological information. This review summarizes the methodologies of analysis and application of high-throughput protein-protein interaction data, including the evaluation methods, the relationship between protein-protein interaction data and other protein biological information, and their applications in biological study. In addition, this paper also suggests some interesting topics on mining high-throughput protein-protein interaction data.

33749628461	Identification and analysis of the mouse basic/Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factor family	The basic/Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) proteins are a family of transcription factors that regulates a variety of biological processes. Based on a previously defined consensus motif, we identified the complete set of bHLH protein family from the mouse proteome databases and carried out a series of bioinformatics analysis. As results, 124 mouse bHLH proteins were identified in this study, and 28 of them were additional bHLH proteins beyond the previous report. These 124 mouse bHLH proteins were classified into groups from A to F by the nomenclature and phylogenetic analysis. Statistic analysis of the Gene Ontology annotation of these proteins showed that the bHLH proteins tend to perform functions related to cell differentiation and development. Gene function enrichment analysis among six groups illuminated that the proteins in certain group tend to have special biology functions, so that the molecular function of the uncharacterized proteins in groups could be inferred. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

3543034045	Development of genome-wide DNA polymorphism database for map-based cloning of rice genes	DNA polymorphism is the basis to develop molecular markers that are widely used in genetic mapping today. A genome-wide rice (Oryza sativa) DNA polymorphism database has been constructed in this work using the genomes of Nipponbare, a cultivar of japonica, and 93-11, a cultivar of indica. This database contains 1,703,176 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 479,406 Insertion/Deletions (InDels), approximately one SNP every 268 bp and one InDel every 953 bp in rice genome. Both SNPs and InDels in the database were experimentally validated. Of 109 randomly selected SNPs, 107 SNPs (98.2%) are accurate. PCR analysis indicated that 90% (97 of 108) of InDels in the database could be used as molecular markers, and 68% to 89% of the 97 InDel markers have polymorphisms between other indica cultivars (Guang-lu-ai 4 and Long-te-pu B) and japonica cultivars (Zhong-hua 11 and 9522). This suggests that this database can be used not only for Nipponbare and 93-11, but also for other japonica and indica cultivars. While validating InDel polymorphisms in the database, a set of InDel markers with each chromosome 3 to 5 marker was developed. These markers are inexpensive and easy to use, and can be used for any combination of japonica and indica cultivars used in this work. This rice DNA polymorphism database will be a valuable resource and important tool for map-based cloning of rice gene, as well as in other various research on rice (http://shenghuan.shnu.edu. cn/ricemarker).

38349134867	Exploration of gene-gene interaction effects using entropy-based methods	Gene-gene interaction may play important roles in complex disease studies, in which interaction effects coupled with single-gene effects are active. Many interaction models have been proposed since the beginning of the last century. However, the existing approaches including statistical and data mining methods rarely consider genetic interaction models, which make the interaction results lack biological or genetic meaning. In this study, we developed an entropy-based method integrating two-locus genetic models to explore such interaction effects. We performed our method to simulated and real data for evaluation. Simulation results show that this method is effective to detect gene-gene interaction and, furthermore, it is able to identify the best-fit model from various interaction models. Moreover, our method, when applied to malaria data, successfully revealed negative epistatic effect between sickle cell anemia and α

38949215411	InPrePPI: An integrated evaluation method based on genomic context for predicting protein-protein interactions in prokaryotic genomes	Background: Although many genomic features have been used in the prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), frequently only one is used in a computational method. After realizing the limited power in the prediction using only one genomic feature, investigators are now moving toward integration. So far, there have been few integration studies for PPI prediction; one failed to yield appreciable improvement of prediction and the others did not conduct performance comparison. It remains unclear whether an integration of multiple genomic features can improve the PPI prediction and, if it can, how to integrate these features. Results: In this study, we first performed a systematic evaluation on the PPI prediction in Escherichia coli (E. coli) by four genomic context based methods: the phylogenetic profile method, the gene cluster method, the gene fusion method, and the gene neighbor method. The number of predicted PPIs and the average degree in the predicted PPI networks varied greatly among the four methods. Further, no method outperformed the others when we tested using three well-defined positive datasets from the KEGG, EcoCyc, and DIP databases. Based on these comparisons, we developed a novel integrated method, named InPrePPI. InPrePPI first normalizes the AC value (an integrated value of the accuracy and coverage) of each method using three positive datasets, then calculates a weight for each method, and finally uses the weight to calculate an integrated score for each protein pair predicted by the four genomic context based methods. We demonstrate that InPrePPI outperforms each of the four individual methods and, in general, the other two existing integrated methods: the joint observation method and the integrated prediction method in STRING. These four methods and InPrePPI are implemented in a user-friendly web interface. Conclusion: This study evaluated the PPI prediction by four genomic context based methods, and presents an integrated evaluation method that shows better performance in E. coli. © 2007 Sun et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84887417079	Ligand binding site similarity identification based on chemical and geometric similarity	The similarity comparison of binding sites based on amino acid between different proteins can facilitate protein function identification. However, Binding site usually consists of several crucial amino acids which are frequently dispersed among different regions of a protein and consequently make the comparison of binding sites difficult. In this study, we introduce a new method, named as chemical and geometric similarity of binding site (CGS-BSite), to compute the ligand binding site similarity based on discrete amino acids with maximum-weight bipartite matching algorithm. The principle of computing the similarity is to find a Euclidean Transformation which makes the similar amino acids approximate to each other in a geometry space, and vice versa. CGS-BSite permits site and ligand flexibilities, provides a stable prediction performance on the flexible ligand binding sites. Binding site prediction on three test datasets with CGS-BSite method has similar performance to Patch-Surfer method but outperforms other five tested methods, reaching to 0.80, 0.71 and 0.85 based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, respectively. It performs a marginally better than Patch-Surfer on the binding sites with small volume and higher hydrophobicity, and presents good robustness to the variance of the volume and hydrophobicity of ligand binding sites. Overall, our method provides an alternative approach to compute the ligand binding site similarity and predict potential special ligand binding sites from the existing ligand targets based on the target similarity. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84897887349	Integrating multiple resources to identify specific transcriptional cooperativity with a Bayesian approach	Motivation: Limited cohort of transcription factors is capable to structure various gene-expression patterns. Transcriptional cooperativity (TC) is deemed to be the main mechanism of complexity and precision in regulatory programs. Although many data types generated from numerous experimental technologies are utilized in an attempt to understand combinational transcriptional regulation, complementary computational approach that can integrate diverse data resources and assimilate them into biological model is still under development.Results: We developed a novel Bayesian approach for integrative analysis of proteomic, transcriptomic and genomic data to identify specific TC. The model evaluation demonstrated distinguishable power of features derived from distinct data sources and their essentiality to model performance. Our model outperformed other classifiers and alternative methods. The application that contextualized TC within hepatocarcinogenesis revealed carcinoma associated alterations. Derived TC networks were highly significant in capturing validated cooperativity as well as revealing novel ones. Our methodology is the first multiple data integration approach to predict dynamic nature of TC. It is promising in identifying tissue- or disease-specific TC and can further facilitate the interpretation of underlying mechanisms for various physiological conditions. © 2013 The Author 2013.

84907876196	Regulatory network rewiring for secondary metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana under various conditions	Background: Plant secondary metabolites are critical to various biological processes. However, the regulations of these metabolites are complex because of regulatory rewiring or crosstalk. To unveil how regulatory behaviors on secondary metabolism reshape biological processes, we constructed and analyzed a dynamic regulatory network of secondary metabolic pathways in Arabidopsis.Results: The dynamic regulatory network was constructed through integrating co-expressed gene pairs and regulatory interactions. Regulatory interactions were either predicted by conserved transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) or proved by experiments. We found that integrating two data (co-expression and predicted regulatory interactions) enhanced the number of highly confident regulatory interactions by over 10% compared with using single data. The dynamic changes of regulatory network systematically manifested regulatory rewiring to explain the mechanism of regulation, such as in terpenoids metabolism, the regulatory crosstalk of RAV1 (AT1G13260) and ATHB1 (AT3G01470) on HMG1 (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, AT1G76490); and regulation of RAV1 on epoxysqualene biosynthesis and sterol biosynthesis. Besides, we investigated regulatory rewiring with expression, network topology and upstream signaling pathways. Regulatory rewiring was revealed by the variability of genes' expression: pathway genes and transcription factors (TFs) were significantly differentially expressed under different conditions (such as terpenoids biosynthetic genes in tissue experiments and E2F/DP family members in genotype experiments). Both network topology and signaling pathways supported regulatory rewiring. For example, we discovered correlation among the numbers of pathway genes, TFs and network topology: one-gene pathways (such as δ-carotene biosynthesis) were regulated by a fewer TFs, and were not critical to metabolic network because of their low degrees in topology. Upstream signaling pathways of 50 TFs were identified to comprehend the underlying mechanism of TFs' regulatory rewiring.Conclusion: Overall, this dynamic regulatory network largely improves the understanding of perplexed regulatory rewiring in secondary metabolism in Arabidopsis. © 2014 Lv et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

4444262260	mRNA expression profiling reveals a role of Helicobacter pylori vacuolating toxin in escaping host defense	Aim: To study the immune response of host to Helicobacter pylori VacA. Methods: The monocyte/macrophage-like U937 cells were infected with Helicobacter pylori vacA-positive strain NCTC 11638 or isogenic vacA-negative mutant. Differentially expressed genes were identified at 2, 6, 10, and 24 h post-infection by cDNA microarray. Differential expressions of some genes were confirmed by Northern blot. Results: More than 100 genes altered their mRNA expression at different time points respectively, many of which were identified to be related to immune evasion. Conclusion: VacA is a crucial element for H pylori to escape from host immune defense by means of differentially regulating the expression of some related genes. These genes, previously known or unknown to be involved in the mechanism of immune evasion, deserve further investigation to unearth much more information complicated in the immune response.

46349096129	Regulatory module network of basic/helix-loop-helix transcription factors in mouse brain	Background: The basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are important components of the transcriptional regulatory network, controlling a variety of biological processes, especially the development of the central nervous system. Until now, reports describing the regulatory network of the bHLH transcription factor (TF) family have been scarce. In order to understand the regulatory mechanisms of bHLH TFs in mouse brain, we inferred their regulatory network from genome-wide gene expression profiles with the module networks method. Results: A regulatory network comprising 15 important bHLH TFs and 153 target genes was constructed. The network was divided into 28 modules based on expression profiles. A regulatory-motif search shows the complexity and diversity of the network. In addition, 26 cooperative bHLH TF pairs were also detected in the network. This cooperation suggests possible physical interactions or genetic regulation between TFs. Interestingly, some TFs in the network regulate more than one module. A novel cross-repression between Neurod6 and Hey2 was identified, which may control various functions in different brain regions. The presence of TF binding sites (TFBSs) in the promoter regions of their target genes validates more than 70% of TF-target gene pairs of the network. Literature mining provides additional support for five modules. More importantly, the regulatory relationships among selected key components are all validated in mutant mice. Conclusion: Our network is reliable and very informative for understanding the role of bHLH TFs in mouse brain development and function. It provides a framework for future experimental analyses. © 2007 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

51349166201	Gene expression profiling-based in silico approach to identify potential vaccine candidates and drug targets against B. pertussis and B. parapertussis	Whooping cough (pertussis) caused by B. pertussis (B.p) is still serious public health threat. B. parapertussis (B.pp), closely related to B.p, also causes whooping cough. The incidence of B.pp infections has been increasing over the last decades, partly because pertussis vaccines have low efficiency against B.pp infections. Moreover, because the majority of pertussis patients are infants, common antimicrobial agents producing serious adverse reactions in infants are not fully satisfactory. Therefore, we try to identify potential vaccine candidates and alternative drug targets against both B.p and B.pp. This preliminary work integrates several different kinds of data from in silico analysis, comparative genomic hybridization, global transcriptional profiling, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to screen potential vaccine candidates and drug targets against the two species. Finally, 191 potential crossprotective vaccine candidates are identified. They have high transcriptional levels in both species, or are associated with virulence and pathogenesis. Moreover, these proteins are not only potentially surface-exposed in the bacteria, but also well conserved among the 165 B.p and B.pp strains. Among them, 22 candidates with high essentiality in the two PPI networks of B.p and B.pp are regarded as suitable drug targets against the two species. We just selected Bordetella as an example to develop a rapid and reliable approach for screening alternative drug targets that associated with novel protein pathways, complexes, and cellular functions against these antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Further researches focusing on the 191 vaccine candidates could accelerate the development of more effective vaccines and drug therapy against B.p and B.pp infection. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

53349177756	Construction of a chloroplast protein interaction network and functional mining of photosynthetic proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana	Chloroplast is a typical plant cell organelle where photosynthesis takes place. In this study, a total of 1 808 chloroplast core proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana were reliably identified by combining the results of previously published studies and our own predictions. We then constructed a chloroplast protein interaction network primarily based on these core protein interactions. The network had 22 925 protein interaction pairs which involved 2 214 proteins. A total of 160 previously uncharacterized proteins were annotated in this network. The subunits of the photosynthetic complexes were modularized, and the functional relationships among photosystem I (PSI), photosystem II (PSII), light harvesting complex of photosystem I (LHC I) and light harvesting complex of photosystem I (LHC II) could be deduced from the predicted protein interactions in this network. We further confirmed an interaction between an unknown protein AT1G52220 and a photosynthetic subunit PSI-D2 by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Our chloroplast protein interaction network should be useful for functional mining of photosynthetic proteins and investigation of chloroplast-related functions at the systems biology level in Arabidopsis. © 2008 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

75549083388	HlungDB: An integrated database of human lung cancer research	The human lung cancer database (HLungDB) is a database with the integration of the lung cancer-related genes, proteins and miRNAs together with the corresponding clinical information. The main purpose of this platform is to establish a network of lung cancer-related molecules and to facilitate the mechanistic study of lung carcinogenesis. The entries describing the relationships between molecules and human lung cancer in the current release were extracted manually from literatures. Currently, we have collected 2585 genes and 212 miRNA with the experimental evidences involved in the different stages of lung carcinogenesis through text mining. Furthermore, we have incorporated the results from analysis of transcription factor-binding motifs, the promoters and the SNP sites for each gene. Since epigenetic alterations also play an important role in lung carcinogenesis, genes with epigenetic regulation were also included. We hope HLungDB will enrich our knowledge about lung cancer biology and eventually lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

77955161850	Functional analysis of multiple genomic signatures demonstrates that classification algorithms choose phenotype-related genes	Gene expression signatures of toxicity and clinical response benefit both safety assessment and clinical practice; however, difficulties in connecting signature genes with the predicted end points have limited their application. The Microarray Quality Control Consortium II (MAQCII) project generated 262 signatures for ten clinical and three toxicological end points from six gene expression data sets, an unprecedented collection of diverse signatures that has permitted a wide-ranging analysis on the nature of such predictive models. A comprehensive analysis of the genes of these signatures and their nonredundant unions using ontology enrichment, biological network building and interactome connectivity analyses demonstrated the link between gene signatures and the biological basis of their predictive power. Different signatures for a given end point were more similar at the level of biological properties and transcriptional control than at the gene level. Signatures tended to be enriched in function and pathway in an end point and model-specific manner, and showed a topological bias for incoming interactions. Importantly, the level of biological similarity between different signatures for a given end point correlated positively with the accuracy of the signature predictions. These findings will aid the understanding, and application of predictive genomic signatures, and support their broader application in predictive medicine. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

78149328398	Global protein interactome exploration through mining genome-scale data in Arabidopsis thaliana	Background: Many essential cellular processes, such as cellular metabolism, transport, cellular metabolism and most regulatory mechanisms, rely on physical interactions between proteins. Genome-wide protein interactome networks of yeast, human and several other animal organisms have already been established, but this kind of network reminds to be established in the field of plant.Results: We first predicted the protein protein interaction in Arabidopsis thaliana with methods, including ortholog, SSBP, gene fusion, gene neighbor, phylogenetic profile, coexpression, protein domain, and used Naïve Bayesian approach next to integrate the results of these methods and text mining data to build a genome-wide protein interactome network. Furthermore, we adopted the data of GO enrichment analysis, pathway, published literature to validate our network, the confirmation of our network shows the feasibility of using our network to predict protein function and other usage.Conclusions: Our interactome is a comprehensive genome-wide network in the organism plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and provides a rich resource for researchers in related field to study the protein function, molecular interaction and potential mechanism under different conditions. © 2010 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

78149341731	Nucleosome structure incorporated histone acetylation site prediction in arabidopsis thaliana	Acetylation is a crucial post-translational modification for histones, and plays a key role in gene expression regulation. Due to limited data and lack of a clear acetylation consensus sequence, a few researches have focused on prediction of lysine acetylation sites. Several systematic prediction studies have been conducted for human and yeast, but less for Arabidopsis thaliana. Concerning the insufficient observation on acetylation site, we analyzed contributions of the peptide-alignment-based distance definition and 3D structure factors in acetylation prediction. We found that traditional structure contributes little to acetylation site prediction. Identified acetylation sites of histones in Arabidopsis thaliana are conserved and cross predictable with that of human by peptide based methods. However, the predicted specificity is overestimated, because of the existence of non-observed acetylable site. Here, by performing a complete exploration on the factors that affect the acetylability of lysines in histones, we focused on the relative position of lysine at nucleosome level, and defined a new structure feature to promote the performance in predicting the acetylability of all the histone lysines in A. thaliana. We found a new spacial correlated acetylation factor, and defined a ε-N spacial location based feature, which contains five core spacial ellipsoid wired areas. By incorporating the new feature, the performance of predicting the acetylability of all the histone lysines in A. Thaliana was promoted, in which the previous mispredicted acetylable lysines were corrected by comparing to the peptide-based prediction. © 2010 Zhao et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

78149454849	Systematical detection of significant genes in microarray data by incorporating gene interaction relationship in biological systems	Many methods, including parametric, nonparametric, and Bayesian methods, have been used for detecting differentially expressed genes based on the assumption that biological systems are linear, which ignores the nonlinear characteristics of most biological systems. More importantly, those methods do not simultaneously consider means, variances, and high moments, resulting in relatively high false positive rate. To overcome the limitations, the SWang test is proposed to determine differentially expressed genes according to the equality of distributions between case and control. Our method not only latently incorporates functional relationships among genes to consider nonlinear biological system but also considers the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of expression profiles simultaneously. To illustrate biological significance of high moments, we construct a nonlinear gene interaction model, demonstrating that skewness and kurtosis could contain useful information of function association among genes in microarrays. Simulations and real microarray results show that false positive rate of SWang is lower than currently popular methods (T-test, F-test, SAM, and Fold-change) with much higher statistical power. Additionally, SWang can uniquely detect significant genes in real microarray data with imperceptible differential expression but higher variety in kurtosis and skewness. Those identified genes were confirmed with previous published literature or RT-PCR experiments performed in our lab. © 2010 Wang et al.

78650735473	The Microarray Quality Control (MAQC)-II study of common practices for the development and validation of microarray-based predictive models	Gene expression data from microarrays are being applied to predict preclinical and clinical endpoints, but the reliability of these predictions has not been established. In the MAQC-II project, 36 independent teams analyzed six microarray data sets to generate predictive models for classifying a sample with respect to one of 13 endpoints indicative of lung or liver toxicity in rodents, or of breast cancer, multiple myeloma or neuroblastoma in humans. In total, >30,000 models were built using many combinations of analytical methods. The teams generated predictive models without knowing the biological meaning of some of the endpoints and, to mimic clinical reality, tested the models on data that had not been used for training. We found that model performance depended largely on the endpoint and team proficiency and that different approaches generated models of similar performance. The conclusions and recommendations from MAQC-II should be useful for regulatory agencies, study committees and independent investigators that evaluate methods for global gene expression analysis. © 2010 Nature America, Inc.

78651281214	AtPID: The overall hierarchical functional protein interaction network interface and analytic platform for arabidopsis	Protein interactions are involved in important cellular functions and biological processes that are the fundamentals of all life activities. With improvements in experimental techniques and progress in research, the overall protein interaction network frameworks of several model organisms have been created through data collection and integration. However, most of the networks processed only show simple relationships without boundary, weight or direction, which do not truly reflect the biological reality. In vivo, different types of protein interactions, such as the assembly of protein complexes or phosphorylation, often have their specific functions and qualifications. Ignorance of these features will bring much bias to the network analysis and application. Therefore, we annotate the Arabidopsis proteins in the AtPID database with further information (e.g. functional annotation, subcellular localization, tissue-specific expression, phosphorylation information, SNP phenotype and mutant phenotype, etc.) and interaction qualifications (e.g. transcriptional regulation, complex assembly, functional collaboration, etc.) via further literature text mining and integration of other resources. Meanwhile, the related information is vividly displayed to users through a comprehensive and newly developed display and analytical tools. The system allows the construction of tissue-specific interaction networks with display of canonical pathways.

79551644334	Integrative identification of Arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome and its function exploitation through protein interaction network	Mitochondria are major players on the production of energy, and host several key reactions involved in basic metabolism and biosynthesis of essential molecules. Currently, the majority of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial proteins are unknown even for model plant Arabidopsis. We reported a computational framework for predicting Arabidopsis mitochondrial proteins based on a probabilistic model, called Naive Bayesian Network, which integrates disparate genomic data generated from eight bioinformatics tools, multiple orthologous mappings, protein domain properties and co-expression patterns using 1,027 microarray profiles. Through this approach, we predicted 2,311 candidate mitochondrial proteins with 84.67% accuracy and 2.53% FPR performances. Together with those experimental confirmed proteins, 2,585 mitochondria proteins (named CoreMitoP) were identified, we explored those proteins with unknown functions based on protein-protein interaction network (PIN) and annotated novel functions for 26.65% CoreMitoP proteins. Moreover, we found newly predicted mitochondrial proteins embedded in particular subnetworks of the PIN, mainly functioning in response to diverse environmental stresses, like salt, draught, cold, and wound etc. Candidate mitochondrial proteins involved in those physiological acitivites provide useful targets for further investigation. Assigned functions also provide comprehensive information for Arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome. © 2011 Cui et al.

79955417840	A comprehensive analysis of the dynamic biological networks in hcv induced hepatocarcinogenesis	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignancy of the liver, which is closely related to hepatitis C and cirrhosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the hepatocarcinogenesis induced by HCV infection remain clarified from a standpoint of systems biology. By integrating data from protein-protein interactions, transcriptional regulation, and disease related microarray analysis, we carried out a dynamic biological network analysis on the progression of HCV induced hepatocarcinogenesis, and systematically explored the potentially disease-related mechanisms through a network view. The dysfunctional interactions among proteins and deregulatory relationships between transcription factors and their target genes could be causes for the occurrence and progression of this disease. The six pathologically defined disease stages in the development and progression of HCC after HCV infection were included in this study. We constructed disease-related biological networks for each disease stage, and identified progression-related sub-networks that potentially play roles in the developmental stage of the corresponding disease and participate in the later stage of cancer progression. In addition, we identified novel risk factors related to HCC based on the analysis of the progression-related sub-networks. The dynamic characteristics of the network reflect important features of the disease development and progression, which provide important information for us to further explore underlying mechanisms of the disease. © 2011 He et al.

82355183893	Comparative analysis of human protein-coding and noncoding rnas between brain and 10 mixed cell lines by RNA-seq	In their expression process, different genes can generate diverse functional products, including various protein-coding or noncoding RNAs. Here, we investigated the protein-coding capacities and the expression levels of their isoforms for human known genes, the conservation and disease association of long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) with two transcriptome sequencing datasets from human brain tissues and 10 mixed cell lines. Comparative analysis revealed that about two-thirds of the genes expressed between brain and cell lines are the same, but less than one-third of their isoforms are identical. Besides those genes specially expressed in brain and cell lines, about 66% of genes expressed in common encoded different isoforms. Moreover, most genes dominantly expressed one isoform and some genes only generated protein-coding (or noncoding) RNAs in one sample but not in another. We found 282 human genes could encode both protein-coding and noncoding RNAs through alternative splicing in the two samples. We also identified more than 1,000 long ncRNAs, and most of those long ncRNAs contain conserved elements across either 46 vertebrates or 33 placental mammals or 10 primates. Further analysis showed that some long ncRNAs differentially expressed in human breast cancer or lung cancer, several of those differentially expressed long ncRNAs were validated by RT-PCR. In addition, those validated differentially expressed long ncRNAs were found significantly correlated with certain breast cancer or lung cancer related genes, indicating the important biological relevance between long ncRNAs and human cancers. Our findings reveal that the differences of gene expression profile between samples mainly result from the expressed gene isoforms, and highlight the importance of studying genes at the isoform level for completely illustrating the intricate transcriptome. © 2011 Chen et al.

82455162834	Revealing the missing expressed genes beyond the human reference genome by RNA-Seq	Background: The complete and accurate human reference genome is important for functional genomics researches. Therefore, the incomplete reference genome and individual specific sequences have significant effects on various studies.Results: we used two RNA-Seq datasets from human brain tissues and 10 mixed cell lines to investigate the completeness of human reference genome. First, we demonstrated that in previously identified ~5 Mb Asian and ~5 Mb African novel sequences that are absent from the human reference genome of NCBI build 36, ~211 kb and ~201 kb of them could be transcribed, respectively. Our results suggest that many of those transcribed regions are not specific to Asian and African, but also present in Caucasian. Then, we found that the expressions of 104 RefSeq genes that are unalignable to NCBI build 37 in brain and cell lines are higher than 0.1 RPKM. 55 of them are conserved across human, chimpanzee and macaque, suggesting that there are still a significant number of functional human genes absent from the human reference genome. Moreover, we identified hundreds of novel transcript contigs that cannot be aligned to NCBI build 37, RefSeq genes and EST sequences. Some of those novel transcript contigs are also conserved among human, chimpanzee and macaque. By positioning those contigs onto the human genome, we identified several large deletions in the reference genome. Several conserved novel transcript contigs were further validated by RT-PCR.Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that a significant number of genes are still absent from the incomplete human reference genome, highlighting the importance of further refining the human reference genome and curating those missing genes. Our study also shows the importance of de novo transcriptome assembly. The comparative approach between reference genome and other related human genomes based on the transcriptome provides an alternative way to refine the human reference genome. © 2011 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

82955165140	Prognostic significance of vascular endothelial growth factor expression in gastric carcinoma: A meta-analysis	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to comprehensively and quantitatively summarize available evidences for the use of VEGF protein to evaluate the clinicopathological and prognostic role of VEGF expression in Asian patients with gastric cancer. Method: Searches were applied to MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases until June 2010, without language restrictions. A meta-analysis was performed to clarify the impact of VEGF expression on clinicopathological parameters or over survival (OS) in gastric cancer. Results: Our combined results showed that VEGF expression in Asian patients with gastric cancer was significantly higher in the case-control studies (1,194 patients and 1,618 controls) (odds ratio [OR] = 112.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 64.12-197.06). All the analyses estimated favored a stronger link between the high VEGF expression and the poor 5-year overall survival (1,236 patients) (risk ratio [RR] = 2.45, 95% CI = 2.11-2.83, P = 0.000). When stratifying the studies by the pathological variables, the depth of invasion (3,094 patients) (OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.40-2.71, P = 0.000), lymph node metastasis (3,240 patients) (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.29-2.57, P = 0.001), distant metastasis (1,980 patients) (OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.22-6.25, P = 0.015), vascular invasion (1,803 patients) (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 2.09-3.27, P = 0.000), and TNM stage (1,819 patients) (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.57-2.36, P = 0.000) provided significant prognostic information. Conclusion: Our results indicate that VEGF can potently predict the overall survival in Asian patients with gastric cancer. Importantly, VEGF may be converted from candidate to the routine clinical setting for clinicians to predict the outcome of single patient with gastric carcinoma. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84255163291	Exploring virus relationships based on virus-host protein-protein interaction network	Background: Currently, several systems have been proposed to classify viruses and indicate the relationships between different ones, though each system has its limitations because of the complexity of viral origins and their rapid evolution rate. We hereby propose a new method to explore the relationships between different viruses.Method: A new method, which is based on the virus-host protein-protein interaction network, is proposed in this paper to categorize viruses. The distances between 114 human viruses, including 48 HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses, are estimated according to the protein-protein interaction network between these viruses and humans.Conclusions/significance: The results demonstrated that our method can disclose not only relationships consistent with the taxonomic results of currently used systems of classification but also the potential relationships that the current virus classification systems have not revealed. Moreover, the method points to a new direction where the functional relationships between viruses and hosts can be used to explore the virus relationships on a systematic level. © 2011 Xu et al.

84255163353	Maximizing biomarker discovery by minimizing gene signatures	Background: The use of gene signatures can potentially be of considerable value in the field of clinical diagnosis. However, gene signatures defined with different methods can be quite various even when applied the same disease and the same endpoint. Previous studies have shown that the correct selection of subsets of genes from microarray data is key for the accurate classification of disease phenotypes, and a number of methods have been proposed for the purpose. However, these methods refine the subsets by only considering each single feature, and they do not confirm the association between the genes identified in each gene signature and the phenotype of the disease. We proposed an innovative new method termed Minimize Feature's Size (MFS) based on multiple level similarity analyses and association between the genes and disease for breast cancer endpoints by comparing classifier models generated from the second phase of MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC-II), trying to develop effective meta-analysis strategies to transform the MAQC-II signatures into a robust and reliable set of biomarker for clinical applications.Results: We analyzed the similarity of the multiple gene signatures in an endpoint and between the two endpoints of breast cancer at probe and gene levels, the results indicate that disease-related genes can be preferably selected as the components of gene signature, and that the gene signatures for the two endpoints could be interchangeable. The minimized signatures were built at probe level by using MFS for each endpoint. By applying the approach, we generated a much smaller set of gene signature with the similar predictive power compared with those gene signatures from MAQC-II.Conclusions: Our results indicate that gene signatures of both large and small sizes could perform equally well in clinical applications. Besides, consistency and biological significances can be detected among different gene signatures, reflecting the studying endpoints. New classifiers built with MFS exhibit improved performance with both internal and external validation, suggesting that MFS method generally reduces redundancies for features within gene signatures and improves the performance of the model. Consequently, our strategy will be beneficial for the microarray-based clinical applications. © 2011 Chang et al. licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84255175663	A transcriptional dynamic network during Arabidopsis thaliana pollen development	Background: To understand transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs), especially the coordinated dynamic regulation between transcription factors (TFs) and their corresponding target genes during development, computational approaches would represent significant advances in the genome-wide expression analysis. The major challenges for the experiments include monitoring the time-specific TFs' activities and identifying the dynamic regulatory relationships between TFs and their target genes, both of which are currently not yet available at the large scale. However, various methods have been proposed to computationally estimate those activities and regulations. During the past decade, significant progresses have been made towards understanding pollen development at each development stage under the molecular level, yet the regulatory mechanisms that control the dynamic pollen development processes remain largely unknown. Here, we adopt Networks Component Analysis (NCA) to identify TF activities over time couse, and infer their regulatory relationships based on the coexpression of TFs and their target genes during pollen development.Results: We carried out meta-analysis by integrating several sets of gene expression data related to Arabidopsis thaliana pollen development (stages range from UNM, BCP, TCP, HP to 0.5 hr pollen tube and 4 hr pollen tube). We constructed a regulatory network, including 19 TFs, 101 target genes and 319 regulatory interactions. The computationally estimated TF activities were well correlated to their coordinated genes' expressions during the development process. We clustered the expression of their target genes in the context of regulatory influences, and inferred new regulatory relationships between those TFs and their target genes, such as transcription factor WRKY34, which was identified that specifically expressed in pollen, and regulated several new target genes. Our finding facilitates the interpretation of the expression patterns with more biological relevancy, since the clusters corresponding to the activity of specific TF or the combination of TFs suggest the coordinated regulation of TFs to their target genes.Conclusions: Through integrating different resources, we constructed a dynamic regulatory network of Arabidopsis thaliana during pollen development with gene coexpression and NCA. The network illustrated the relationships between the TFs' activities and their target genes' expression, as well as the interactions between TFs, which provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms that control the pollen development. © 2011 Wang et al.

84255194504	Maximum predictive power of the microarray-based models for clinical outcomes is limited by correlation between endpoint and gene expression profile	Background: Microarray data have been used for gene signature selection to predict clinical outcomes. Many studies have attempted to identify factors that affect models' performance with only little success. Fine-tuning of model parameters and optimizing each step of the modeling process often results in over-fitting problems without improving performance.Results: We propose a quantitative measurement, termed consistency degree, to detect the correlation between disease endpoint and gene expression profile. Different endpoints were shown to have different consistency degrees to gene expression profiles. The validity of this measurement to estimate the consistency was tested with significance at a p-value less than 2.2e-16 for all of the studied endpoints. According to the consistency degree score, overall survival milestone outcome of multiple myeloma was proposed to extend from 730 days to 1561 days, which is more consistent with gene expression profile.Conclusion: For various clinical endpoints, the maximum predictive powers of different microarray-based models are limited by the correlation between endpoint and gene expression profile of disease samples as indicated by the consistency degree score. In addition, previous defined clinical outcomes can also be reassessed and refined more coherent according to related disease gene expression profile. Our findings point to an entirely new direction for assessing the microarray-based predictive models and provide important information to gene signature based clinical applications. © 2011 Zhao et al. licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84862830502	REGγ is associated with multiple oncogenic pathways in human cancers	Background: Recent studies suggest a role of the proteasome activator, REGγ, in cancer progression. Since there are limited numbers of known REGγ targets, it is not known which cancers and pathways are associated with REGγ.Methods: REGγ protein expressions in four different cancers were investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. Following NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database search, microarray platform validation, differential expressions of REGγ in corresponding cancers were statistically analyzed. Genes highly correlated with REGγ were defined based on Pearson's correlation coefficient. Functional links were estimated by Ingenuity Core analysis. Finally, validation was performed by RT-PCR analysis in established cancer cell lines and IHC in human colon cancer tissues. Results: Here, we demonstrate overexpression of REGγ in four different cancer types by micro-tissue array analysis. Using meta-analysis of publicly available microarray databases and biological studies, we verified elevated REGγ gene expression in the four types of cancers and identified genes significantly correlated with REGγ expression, including genes in p53, Myc pathways, and multiple other cancer-related pathways. The predicted correlations were largely consistent with quantitative RT-PCR analysis.Conclusions: This study provides us novel insights in REGγ gene expression profiles and its link to multiple cancer-related pathways in cancers. Our results indicate potentially important pathogenic roles of REGγ in multiple cancer types and implicate REGγ as a putative cancer marker. © 2012 He et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84862913448	De novo transcriptome assembly of RNA-Seq reads with different strategies	De novo transcriptome assembly is an important approach in RNA-Seq data analysis and it can help us to reconstruct the transcriptome and investigate gene expression profiles without reference genome sequences. We carried out transcriptome assemblies with two RNA-Seq datasets generated from human brain and cell line, respectively. We then determined an efficient way to yield an optimal overall assembly using three different strategies. We first assembled brain and cell line transcriptome using a single k-mer length. Next we tested a range of values of k-mer length and coverage cutoff in assembling. Lastly, we combined the assembled contigs from a range of k values to generate a final assembly. By comparing these assembly results, we found that using only one k-mer value for assembly is not enough to generate good assembly results, but combining the contigs from different k-mer values could yield longer contigs and greatly improve the overall assembly. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84862914469	Overview of available methods for diverse RNA-Seq data analyses	RNA-Seq technology is becoming widely used in various transcriptomics studies; however, analyzing and interpreting the RNA-Seq data face serious challenges. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the sequencing cost is dropping dramatically with the sequencing output increasing sharply. However, the sequencing reads are still short in length and contain various sequencing errors. Moreover, the intricate transcriptome is always more complicated than we expect. These challenges proffer the urgent need of efficient bioinformatics algorithms to effectively handle the large amount of transcriptome sequencing data and carry out diverse related studies. This review summarizes a number of frequently-used applications of transcriptome sequencing and their related analyzing strategies, including short read mapping, exon-exon splice junction detection, gene or isoform expression quantification, differential expression analysis and transcriptome reconstruction. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84863142225	Blood-based gene expression profiles models for classification of subsyndromal symptomatic depression and major depressive disorder	Subsyndromal symptomatic depression (SSD) is a subtype of subthreshold depressive and also lead to significant psychosocial functional impairment as same as major depressive disorder (MDD). Several studies have suggested that SSD is a transitory phenomena in the depression spectrum and is thus considered a subtype of depression. However, the pathophysioloy of depression remain largely obscure and studies on SSD are limited. The present study compared the expression profile and made the classification with the leukocytes by using whole-genome cRNA microarrays among drug-free first-episode subjects with SSD, MDD, and matched controls (8 subjects in each group). Support vector machines (SVMs) were utilized for training and testing on candidate signature expression profiles from signature selection step. Firstly, we identified 63 differentially expressed SSD signatures in contrast to control (P< = 5.0E-4) and 30 differentially expressed MDD signatures in contrast to control, respectively. Then, 123 gene signatures were identified with significantly differential expression level between SSD and MDD. Secondly, in order to conduct priority selection for biomarkers for SSD and MDD together, we selected top gene signatures from each group of pair-wise comparison results, and merged the signatures together to generate better profiles used for clearly classify SSD and MDD sets in the same time. In details, we tried different combination of signatures from the three pair-wise compartmental results and finally determined 48 gene expression signatures with 100% accuracy. Our finding suggested that SSD and MDD did not exhibit the same expressed genome signature with peripheral blood leukocyte, and blood cell-derived RNA of these 48 gene models may have significant value for performing diagnostic functions and classifying SSD, MDD, and healthy controls. © 2012 Yi et al.

84870736247	From Understanding the Development Landscape of the Canonical Fate-Switch Pair to Constructing a Dynamic Landscape for Two-Step Neural Differentiation	Abstract: Recent progress in stem cell biology, notably cell fate conversion, calls for novel theoretical understanding for cell differentiation. The existing qualitative concept of Waddington's "epigenetic landscape" has attracted particular attention because it captures subsequent fate decision points, thus manifesting the hierarchical ("tree-like") nature of cell fate diversification. Here, we generalized a recent work and explored such a developmental landscape for a two-gene fate decision circuit by integrating the underlying probability landscapes with different parameters (corresponding to distinct developmental stages). The change of entropy production rate along the parameter changes indicates which parameter changes can represent a normal developmental process while other parameters' change can not. The transdifferentiation paths over the landscape under certain conditions reveal the possibility of a direct and reversible phenotypic conversion. As the intensity of noise increases, we found that the landscape becomes flatter and the dominant paths more straight, implying the importance of biological noise processing mechanism in development and reprogramming. We further extended the landscape of the one-step fate decision to that for two-step decisions in central nervous system (CNS) differentiation. A minimal network and dynamic model for CNS differentiation was firstly constructed where two three-gene motifs are coupled. We then implemented the SDEs (Stochastic Differentiation Equations) simulation for the validity of the network and model. By integrating the two landscapes for the two switch gene pairs, we constructed the two-step development landscape for CNS differentiation. Our work provides new insights into cellular differentiation and important clues for better reprogramming strategies. © 2012 Qiu et al.

84871994019	Inhibition of breast cancer metastases by a novel inhibitor of TGFβ receptor 1	Background Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), which is implicated in metastasis to various organs in breast cancer, is a potential target for new antitumor metastasis drugs.MethodsTo identify specific inhibitors of TGFβ receptor 1 (TGFβR1) in breast cancer metastasis, a virtual library of more than 400000 different compounds was screened by molecular docking modeling and confirmed with Smad-binding element luciferase and TGFβR1 kinase assays. Affymetrix GeneChip expression analysis of mRNA levels and real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to determine expression changes of TGFβ-mediated, metastasis-associated genes in breast cancer cells after treatment with the small-molecule inhibitor YR-290. YR-290 was also examined for its effects on breast cancer migration, invasion, and metastasis using transwell and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) assays in vitro and three different mouse (BALB/c and NU/NU nude) models (n = 10 per group). Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess survival. All statistical tests were two-sided.ResultsYR-290 interacted with the kinase domain of TGFβR1, abrogated kinase activity (half maximal inhibitory concentration = 137nM, 95% confidence interval = 126.4 to 147.6nM) and inhibited the TGFβ-mediated downstream signaling pathway and metastasis-associated genes in breast cancer cells. YR-290 inhibited TGFβ-modulated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. In tumor metastasis mouse models, YR-290 almost completely blocked cancer metastasis. Numbers of lung tumor nodules of mice treated with 1mg/kg and 5mg/kg YR-290 were reduced by 74.93% (95% confidence interval = 61.45% to 88.41%) and 94.93% (95% confidence interval = 82.13% to 100%), respectively, compared with control mice. Treatment with YR-290 also statistically significantly prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice.ConclusionsYR-290 is a novel inhibitor of tumor metastasis that works by blocking TGFβ signaling pathways. © 2012 The Author.

84872897224	Exploring the pathogenetic association between schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes mellitus diseases based on pathway analysis	Background: Schizophrenia (SCZ) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are both complex diseases. Accumulated studies indicate that schizophrenia patients are prone to present the type 2 diabetes symptoms, but the potential mechanisms behind their association remain unknown. Here we explored the pathogenetic association between SCZ and T2D based on pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction. Results: With sets of prioritized susceptibility genes for SCZ and T2D, we identified significant pathways (with adjusted p-value < 0.05) specific for SCZ or T2D and for both diseases based on pathway enrichment analysis. We also constructed a network to explore the crosstalk among those significant pathways. Our results revealed that some pathways are shared by both SCZ and T2D diseases through a number of susceptibility genes. With 382 unique susceptibility proteins for SCZ and T2D, we further built a protein-protein interaction network by extracting their nearest interacting neighbours. Among 2,104 retrieved proteins, 364 of them were found simultaneously interacted with susceptibility proteins of both SCZ and T2D, and proposed as new candidate risk factors for both diseases. Literature mining supported the potential association of partial new candidate proteins with both SCZ and T2D. Moreover, some proteins were hub proteins with high connectivity and interacted with multiple proteins involved in both diseases, implying their pleiotropic effects for the pathogenic association. Some of these hub proteins are the components of our identified enriched pathways, including calcium signaling, g-secretase mediated ErbB4 signaling, adipocytokine signaling, insulin signaling, AKT signaling and type II diabetes mellitus pathways. Through the integration of multiple lines of information, we proposed that those signaling pathways, which contain susceptibility genes for both diseases, could be the key pathways to bridge SCZ and T2D. AKT could be one of the important shared components and may play a pivotal role to link both of the pathogenetic processes. Conclusions: Our study is the first network and pathway-based systematic analysis for SCZ and T2D, and provides the general pathway-based view of pathogenetic association between two diseases. Moreover, we identified a set of candidate genes potentially contributing to the linkage between these two diseases. This research offers new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the co-occurrence of SCZ and T2D, and thus, could facilitate the inference of novel hypotheses for the co-morbidity of the two diseases. Some etiological factors that exert pleiotropic effects shared by the significant pathways of two diseases may have important implications for the diseases and could be therapeutic intervention targets. © 2013 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84872907093	HDAM: A resource of human disease associated mutations from next generation sequencing studies	Background: Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have greatly facilitated the rapid and economical detection of pathogenic mutations in human disorders. However, mutation descriptions are hard to be compared and integrated due to various reference sequences and annotation tools adopted in different articles as well as the nomenclature of diseases/traits. Description. The Human Disease Associated Mutation (HDAM) database is dedicated to collect, standardize and re-annotate mutations for human diseases discovered by NGS studies. In the current release, HDAM contains 1,114 mutations, located in 669 genes and associated with 125 human diseases through literature mining. All mutation records have uniform and unequivocal descriptions of sequence changes according to the Human Genome Sequence Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature recommendations. Each entry displays comprehensive information, including mutation location in genome (hg18/hg19), gene functional annotation, protein domain annotation, susceptible diseases, the first literature report of the mutation and etc. Moreover, new mutation-disease relationships predicted by Bayesian network are also presented under each mutation. Conclusion: HDAM contains hundreds rigorously curated human mutations from NGS studies and was created to provide a comprehensive view of these mutations that confer susceptibility to the common disorders.

84873719491	Comparative study of de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly strategies for transcriptome reconstruction based on RNA-Seq	Transcriptome reconstruction is an important application of RNA-Seq, providing critical information for further analysis of transcriptome. Although RNA-Seq offers the potential to identify the whole picture of transcriptome, it still presents special challenges. To handle these difficulties and reconstruct transcriptome as completely as possible, current computational approaches mainly employ two strategies: de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly. In order to find the similarities and differences between them, we firstly chose five representative assemblers belonging to the two classes respectively, and then investigated and compared their algorithm features in theory and real performances in practice. We found that all the methods can be reduced to graph reduction problems, yet they have different conceptual and practical implementations, thus each assembly method has its specific advantages and disadvantages, performing worse than others in certain aspects while outperforming others in anther aspects at the same time. Finally we merged assemblies of the five assemblers and obtained a much better assembly. Additionally we evaluated an assembler using genome-guided de novo assembly approach, and achieved good performance. Based on these results, we suggest that to obtain a comprehensive set of recovered transcripts, it is better to use a combination of de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly. © 2013 The Author(s).

84872963322	Integrated lipidomics and transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood reveals significantly enriched pathways in type 2 diabetes mellitus	Background: Insulin resistance is a key element in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Plasma free fatty acids were assumed to mediate the insulin resistance, while the relationship between lipid and glucose disposal remains to be demonstrated across liver, skeletal muscle and blood. Methods. We profiled both lipidomics and gene expression of 144 total peripheral blood samples, 84 from patients with T2D and 60 from healthy controls. Then, factor and partial least squares models were used to perform a combined analysis of lipidomics and gene expression profiles to uncover the bioprocesses that are associated with lipidomic profiles in type 2 diabetes. Results: According to factor analysis of the lipidomic profile, several species of lipids were found to be correlated with different phenotypes, including diabetes-related C23:2CE, C23:3CE, C23:4CE, ePE36:4, ePE36:5, ePE36:6; race-related (African-American) PI36:1; and sex-related PE34:1 and LPC18:2. The major variance of gene expression profile was not caused by known factors and no significant difference can be directly derived from differential gene expression profile. However, the combination of lipidomic and gene expression analyses allows us to reveal the correlation between the altered lipid profile with significantly enriched pathways, such as one carbon pool by folate, arachidonic acid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, propanoate metabolism, and starch and sucrose metabolism. The genes in these pathways showed a good capability to classify diabetes samples. Conclusion: Combined analysis of gene expression and lipidomic profiling reveals type 2 diabetes-associated lipid species and enriched biological pathways in peripheral blood, while gene expression profile does not show direct correlation. Our findings provide a new clue to better understand the mechanism of disordered lipid metabolism in association with type 2 diabetes. © 2013 Zhao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84874837931	Replacements of rare herbs and simplifications of traditional chinese medicine formulae based on attribute similarities and pathway enrichment analysis	A Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula is a collection of several herbs. TCM formulae have been used to treat various diseases for several thousand years. However, wide usage of TCM formulae has results in rapid decline of some rare herbs. So it is urgent to find common available replacements for those rare herbs with the similar effects. In addition, a formula can be simplified by reducing herbs with unchanged effects. Based on this consideration, we propose a method, called "formula pair," to replace the rare herbs and simplify TCM formulae. We show its reasonableness from a perspective of pathway enrichment analysis. Both the replacements of rare herbs and simplifications of formulae provide new approaches for a new formula discovery. We demonstrate our approach by replacing a rare herb "Forsythia suspensa" in the formula "the seventh of Sang Ju Yin plus/minus herbs (SSJY)" with a common herb "Thunberg Fritillary Bulb" and simplifying two formulae, "the fifth of Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang plus/minus herbs (FDHJST)" and "Fang Feng Tang" (FFT) to a new formula "Fang Feng Du Huo Tang" (FFDHT). © 2013 Zhao Fang et al.

84874889837	TCMID: Traditional Chinese medicine integrative database for herb molecular mechanism analysis	As an alternative to modern western medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is receiving increasingly attention worldwide. Great efforts have been paid to TCM's modernization, which tries to bridge the gap between TCM and modern western medicine. As TCM and modern western medicine share a common aspect at molecular level that the compound(s) perturb human's dysfunction network and restore human normal physiological condition, the relationship between compounds (in herb, refer to ingredients) and their targets (proteins) should be the key factor to connect TCM and modern medicine. Accordingly, we construct this Traditional Chinese Medicine Integrated Database (TCMID, http://www.megabionet.org/tcmid/), which records TCM-related information collected from different resources and through text-mining method. To enlarge the scope of the TCMID, the data have been linked to common drug and disease databases, including Drugbank, OMIM and PubChem. Currently, our TCMID contains ∼47 000 prescriptions, 8159 herbs, 25210 compounds, 6828 drugs, 3791 diseases and 17 521 related targets, which is the largest data set for related field. Our web-based software displays a network for integrative relationships between herbs and their treated diseases, the active ingredients and their targets, which will facilitate the study of combination therapy and understanding of the underlying mechanisms for TCM at molecular level. © The Author(s) 2012.

84875418427	Incorporating the human gene annotations in different databases significantly improved transcriptomic and genetic analyses	Human gene annotation is crucial for conducting transcriptomic and genetic studies; however, the impacts of human gene annotations in diverse databases on related studies have been less evaluated. To enable full use of various human annotation resources and better understand the human transcriptome, here we systematically compare the human annotations present in RefSeq, Ensembl (GENCODE), and AceView on diverse transcriptomic and genetic analyses. We found that the human gene annotations in the three databases are far from complete. Although Ensembl and AceView annotated more genes than RefSeq, more than 15,800 genes from Ensembl (or AceView) are within the intergenic and intronic regions of AceView (or Ensembl) annotation. The human transcriptome annotations in RefSeq, Ensembl, and AceView had distinct effects on short-read mapping, gene and isoform expression profiling, and differential expression calling. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the integrated annotation of these databases can obtain a more complete gene set and significantly enhance those transcriptomic analyses. We also observed that many more known SNPs were located within genes annotated in Ensembl and AceView than in RefSeq. In particular, 1033 of 3041 trait/disease-associated SNPs involved in about 200 human traits/diseases that were previously reported to be in RefSeq intergenic regions could be relocated within Ensembl and AceView genes. Our findings illustrate that a more complete transcriptome generated by incorporating human gene annotations in diverse databases can strikingly improve the overall results of transcriptomic and genetic studies.

84879162294	Dissecting the Characteristics and Dynamics of Human Protein Complexes at Transcriptome Cascade Using RNA-Seq Data	Human protein complexes play crucial roles in various biological processes as the functional module. However, the expression features of human protein complexes at the transcriptome cascade are poorly understood. Here, we used the RNA-Seq data from 16 disparate tissues and four types of human cancers to explore the characteristics and dynamics of human protein complexes. We observed that many individual components of human protein complexes can be generated by multiple distinct transcripts. Similar with yeast, the human protein complex constituents are inclined to co-express in diverse tissues. The dominant isoform of the genes involved in protein complexes tend to encode the complex constituents in each tissue. Our results indicate that the protein complex dynamics not only correlate with the presence or absence of complexes, but may also be related to the major isoform switching for complex subunits. Between any two cancers of breast, colon, lung and prostate, we found that only a few of the differentially expressed transcripts associated with complexes were identical, but 5-10 times more protein complexes involved in differentially expressed transcripts were common. Collectively, our study reveals novel properties and dynamics of human protein complexes at the transcriptome cascade in diverse normal tissues and different cancers. © 2013 Chen et al.

84880918628	Comprehensively identifying and characterizing the missing gene sequences in human reference genome with integrated analytic approaches	The human reference genome is still incomplete and a number of gene sequences are missing from it. The approaches to uncover them, the reasons causing their absence and their functions are less explored. Here, we comprehensively identified and characterized the missing genes of human reference genome with RNA-Seq data from 16 different human tissues. By using a combined approach of genome-guided transcriptome reconstruction coupled with genome-wide comparison, we uncovered 3.78 and 2.37 Mb transcribed regions in the human genome assemblies of Celera and HuRef either missed from their homologous chromosomes of NCBI human reference genome build 37.2 or partially or entirely absent from the reference. We further identified a significant number of novel transcript contigs in each tissue from de novo transcriptome assembly that are unalignable to NCBI build 37.2 but can be aligned to at least one of the genomes from Celera, HuRef, chimpanzee, macaca or mouse. Our analyses indicate that the missing genes could result from genome misassembly, transposition, copy number variation, translocation and other structural variations. Moreover, our results further suggest that a large portion of these missing genes are conserved between human and other mammals, implying their important biological functions. Totally, 1,233 functional protein domains were detected in these missing genes. Collectively, our study not only provides approaches for uncovering the missing genes of a genome, but also proposes the potential reasons causing genes missed from the genome and highlights the importance of uncovering the missing genes of incomplete genomes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84886066175	GPR116, an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor, promotes breast cancer metastasis via the Gαq-p63 Rho GEF-Rho GTPase pathway	Adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), which contain adhesion domains in their extracellular region, have been found to play important roles in cell adhesion, motility, embryonic development, and immune response. Because most adhesion molecules with adhesion domains have vital roles in cancer metastasis, we speculated that adhesion GPCRs are potentially involved in cancer metastasis. In this study, we identified GPR116 as a novel regulator of breast cancer metastasis through expression and functional screening of the adhesion GPCR family. We found that knockdown of GPR116 in highly metastatic (MDA-MB231) breast cancer cells suppressed cell migration and invasion. Conversely, ectopic GPR116 expression in poorly metastatic (MCF-7 and Hs578T) cells promoted cell invasion. We further showed that knockdown of GPR116 inhibited breast cancer cell metastasis in two mammary tumor metastasis mouse models. Moreover, GPR116 modulated the formation of lamellipodia and actin stress fibers in cells in a RhoA- and Rac1-dependent manner. At a molecular level, GPR116 regulated cell motility and morphology through the Gαq-p63 Rho GEF-RhoA/Rac1 pathway. The biologic significance of GPR116 in breast cancer is substantiated in human patient samples, where GPR116 expression is significantly correlated with breast tumor progression, recurrence, and poor prognosis. These findings show that GPR116 is crucial for the metastasis of breast cancer and support GPR116 as a potential prognostic marker and drug target against metastatic human breast cancer. © 2013 AACR.

84890315317	Proteomic evidence for genetic epistasis: ClpR4 mutations switch leaf variegation to virescence in Arabidopsis	Chloroplast development in plants is regulated by a series of coordinated biological processes. In this work, a genetic suppressor screen for the leaf variegation phenotype of the thylakoid formation 1 (thf1) mutant combined with a proteomic assay was employed to elucidate this complicated network. We identified a mutation in ClpR4, named clpR4-3, which leads to leaf virescence and also rescues the var2 variegation. Proteomic analysis showed that the chloroplast proteome of clpR4-3 thf1 is dominantly controlled by clpR4-3, providing molecular mechanisms that cause genetic epistasis of clpR4-3 to thf1. Classification of the proteins significantly mis-regulated in the mutants revealed that those functioning in the expression of plastid genes are oppositely regulated while proteins functioning in antioxidative stress, protein folding, and starch metabolism are changed in the same direction between thf1 and clpR4-3. The levels of FtsHs including FtsH2/VAR2, FtsH8, and FtsH5/VAR1 are greatly reduced in thf1 compared with those in the wild type, but are higher in clpR4-3 thf1 than in thf1. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that FtsH expression in clpR4-3 thf1 is regulated post-transcriptionally. In addition, a number of ribosomal proteins are less expressed in the clpR4-3 proteome, which is in line with the reduced levels of rRNAs in clpR4-3. Furthermore, knocking out PRPL11, one of the most downregulated proteins in the clpR4-3 thf1 proteome, rescues the leaf variegation phenotype of the thf1 and var2 mutants. These results provide insights into molecular mechanisms by which the virescent clpR4-3 mutation suppresses leaf variegation of thf1 and var2. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

84892376708	Evaluating the pharmacological mechanism of Chinese Medicine Si-Wu-Tang through multi-level data integration	Si-Wu-Tang (SWT) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula widely used for the treatments of gynecological diseases. To explore the pharmacological mechanism of SWT, we incorporated microarray data of SWT with our herbal target database TCMID to analyze the potential activity mechanism of SWT's herbal ingredients and targets. We detected 2,405 differentially expressed genes in the microarray data, 20 of 102 proteins targeted by SWT were encoded by these DEGs and can be targeted by 2 FDA-approved drugs and 39 experimental drugs. The results of pathway enrichment analysis of the 20 predicted targets were consistent with that of 2,405 differentially expressed genes, elaborating the potential pharmacological mechanisms of SWT. Further study from a perspective of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network showed that the predicted targets of SWT function cooperatively to perform their multi-target effects. We also constructed a network to combine herbs, ingredients, targets and drugs together which bridges the gap between SWT and conventional medicine, and used it to infer the potential mechanisms of herbal ingredients. Moreover, based on the hypothesis that the same or similar effects between different TCM formulae may result from targeting the same proteins, we analyzed 27 other TCM formulae which can also treat the gynecological diseases, the subsequent result provides additional insight to understand the potential mechanisms of SWT in treating amenorrhea. Our bioinformatics approach to detect the pharmacology of SWT may shed light on drug discovery for gynecological diseases and could be utilized to investigate other TCM formulae as well. © 2013 Fang et al.

84920550975	A comprehensive assessment of RNA-seq accuracy, reproducibility and information content by the Sequencing Quality Control Consortium	We present primary results from the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) project, coordinated by the US Food and Drug Administration. Examining Illumina HiSeq, Life Technologies SOLiD and Roche 454 platforms at multiple laboratory sites using reference RNA samples with built-in controls, we assess RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) performance for junction discovery and differential expression profiling and compare it to microarray and quantitative PCR (qPCR) data using complementary metrics. At all sequencing depths, we discover unannotated exon-exon junctions, with >80% validated by qPCR. We find that measurements of relative expression are accurate and reproducible across sites and platforms if specific filters are used. In contrast, RNA-seq and microarrays do not provide accurate absolute measurements, and gene-specific biases are observed for all examined platforms, including qPCR. Measurement performance depends on the platform and data analysis pipeline, and variation is large for transcript-level profiling. The complete SEQC data sets, comprising >100 billion reads (10Tb), provide unique resources for evaluating RNA-seq analyses for clinical and regulatory settings.

10344221089	Association between alcohol, smoking and HLA-DQA1*0201 genotype in psoriasis	Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease triggered by genetic, environment or other risk factors such as infection, drugs, stress, moisture, alcohol, and smoking. A major psoriasis susceptibility locus at 6p21.3 has been identified. Further studies found that HLA-DQA1*0201 allele was associated with psoriasis. However, there were few data exploring an association between the environmental factors and susceptibility genes. In this study, the samples of 189 patients with psoriasis and 333 healthy controls were collected with their consent and were carried on analysis through polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer (PCR-SSP) method. The proportion of male psoriasis patients engaging in the smoking and alcohol was much higher than that of the control group (P<0.005). The HLA-DQA1*0201 allele was present at significantly higher frequency in the patients with psoriasis (OR=4.25, P<1.0×10

12444278969	Identification of probable genomic packaging signal sequence from SARS_CoV genome by bioinformatics analysis	AIM: To predict the probable genomic packaging signal of SARS_CoV by bioinformatics analysis. The derived packaging signal may be used to design antisense RNA and RNA interfere (RNAi) drugs treating SARS. METHODS: Based on the studies about the genomic packaging signals of MHV and BCoV, especially the information about primary and secondary structures, the putative genomic packaging signal of SARS_CoV were analyzed by using bioinformatic tools. Multi-alignment for the genomic sequences was performed among SARS_CoV, MHV, BCoV, PEDV and HCoV 229E. Secondary structures of RNA sequences were also predicted for the identification of the possible genomic packaging signals. Meanwhile, the N and M proteins of all five viruses were analyzed to study the evolutionary relationship with genomic packaging signals. RESULTS: The putative genomic packaging signal of SARS_CoV locates at the 3′ end of ORF1b near that of MHV and BCoV, where is the most variable region of this gene. The RNA secondary structure of SARS_CoV genomic packaging signal is very similar to that of MHV and BCoV. The same result was also obtained in studying the genomic packaging signals of PEDV and HCoV 229E. Further more, the genomic sequence multi-alignment indicated that the locations of packaging signals of SARS_CoV, PEDV, and HCoV overlaped each other. It seems that the mutation rate of packaging signal sequences is much higher than the N protein, while only subtle variations for the M protein. CONCLUSIONS: The probable genomic packaging signal of SARS_CoV is analogous to that of MHV and BCoV, with the corresponding secondary RNA structure locating at the similar region of ORF1b. The positions where genomic packaging signals exist have suffered rounds of mutations, which may influence the primary structures of the N and M proteins consequently.

12444311677	Putative hAPN receptor binding sites in SARS_CoV spike protein	AIM: To obtain the information of ligand-receptor binding between the S protein of SARS_CoV and CD13, identify the possible interacting domains or motifs related to binding sites, and provide clues for studying the functions of SARS proteins and designing anti-SARS drugs and vaccines. METHODS: On the basis of comparative genomics, the homology search, phylogenetic analyses, and multi-sequence alignment were used to predict CD13 related interacting domains and binding sites in the S protein of SARS_CoV. Molecular modeling and docking simulation methods were employed to address the interaction feature between CD13 and S protein of SARS_CoV in validating the bioinformatics predictions. RESULTS: Possible binding sites in the SARS_CoV S protein to CD13 have been mapped out by using bioinformatics analysis tools. The binding for one protein-protein interaction pair (D757-R761 motif of the SARS_CoV S protein to P585-A653 domain of CD13) has been simulated by molecular modeling and docking simulation methods. CONCLUSION: CD13 may be a possible receptor of the SARS_CoV S protein, which may be associated with the SARS infection. This study also provides a possible strategy for mapping the possible binding receptors of the proteins in a genome.

12444316030	Small envelope protein E of SARS: Cloning, expression, purification, CD determination, and bioinformatics analysis	AIM: To obtain the pure sample of SARS small envelope E protein (SARS E protein), study its properties and analyze its possible functions. METHODS: The plasmid of SARS E protein was constructed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the protein was expressed in the E coli strain. The secondary structure feature of the protein was determined by circular dichroism (CD) technique. The possible functions of this protein were annotated by bioinformatics methods, and its possible three-dimensional model was constructed by molecular modeling. RESULTS: The pure sample of SARS E protein was obtained. The secondary structure feature derived from CD determination is similar to that from the secondary structure prediction. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the key residues of SARS E protein were much conserved compared to the E proteins of other coronaviruses. In particular, the primary amino acid sequence of SARS E protein is much more similar to that of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and other mammal coronaviruses. The transmembrane (TM) segment of the SARS E protein is relatively more conserved in the whole protein than other regions. CONCLUSION: The success of expressing the SARS E protein is a good starting point for investigating the structure and functions of this protein and SARS coronavirus itself as well. The SARS E protein may fold in water solution in a similar way as it in membrane-water mixed environment. It is possible that β-sheet I of the SARS E protein interacts with the membrane surface via hydrogen bonding, this β-sheet may uncoil to a random structure in water solution.

84924058574	Regulatory network rewiring for secondary metabolism in under various conditions	Background: Plant secondary metabolites are critical to various biological processes. However, the regulations of these metabolites are complex because of regulatory rewiring or crosstalk. To unveil how regulatory behaviors on secondary metabolism reshape biological processes, we constructed and analyzed a dynamic regulatory network of secondary metabolic pathways in Arabidopsis. Results: The dynamic regulatory network was constructed through integrating co-expressed gene pairs and regulatory interactions. Regulatory interactions were either predicted by conserved transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) or proved by experiments. We found that integrating two data (co-expression and predicted regulatory interactions) enhanced the number of highly confident regulatory interactions by over 10% compared with using single data. The dynamic changes of regulatory network systematically manifested regulatory rewiring to explain the mechanism of regulation, such as in terpenoids metabolism, the regulatory crosstalk of RAV1 (AT1G13260) and ATHB1 (AT3G01470) on HMG1 (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, AT1G76490); and regulation of RAV1 on epoxysqualene biosynthesis and sterol biosynthesis. Besides, we investigated regulatory rewiring with expression, network topology and upstream signaling pathways. Regulatory rewiring was revealed by the variability of genes' expression: pathway genes and transcription factors (TFs) were significantly differentially expressed under different conditions (such as terpenoids biosynthetic genes in tissue experiments and E2F/DP family members in genotype experiments). Both network topology and signaling pathways supported regulatory rewiring. For example, we discovered correlation among the numbers of pathway genes, TFs and network topology: one-gene pathways (such as δ-carotene biosynthesis) were regulated by a fewer TFs, and were not critical to metabolic network because of their low degrees in topology. Upstream signaling pathways of 50 TFs were identified to comprehend the underlying mechanism of TFs' regulatory rewiring. Conclusion: Overall, this dynamic regulatory network largely improves the understanding of perplexed regulatory rewiring in secondary metabolism in Arabidopsis.
