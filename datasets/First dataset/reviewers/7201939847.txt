15244338841	The impact of interpregnancy interval and previous preterm birth on the subsequent risk of preterm birth	OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of the interpregnancy interval and a previous preterm birth on the subsequent risk of a preterm birth. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on a group of 4072 women who had at least two consecutive births, excluding multiple gestation, fetal anomalies, cervical incompetence, and stillbirth. Multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the association between interpregnancy interval, preterm birth of the first child in the pair (index pregnancy), and the risk of a preterm birth of the second child in the pair (outcome pregnancy). RESULTS: Women with interpregnancy intervals of less than 12 months (odds ratio [OR] 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.7) were at increased risks of preterm birth with the outcome pregnancy. Furthermore, there was an increased risk for a subsequent preterm birth in women who had a preterm birth in the index pregnancy (OR 4.2; 95% CI 3.0-6.0). The risk decreased as the interpregnancy interval increased, with a relatively low risk at 18 to 48 months; subsequently, it increased sharply. In contrast, women who had delivered their previous infants at term carried an increased risk of preterm birth with the outcome pregnancy only if the interval was less than 6 months. CONCLUSION: A difference was found in the impact of the interpregnancy interval on the subsequent risk of preterm birth between women with a prior preterm birth and those who previously delivered an infant at term.

17844377570	Outcome of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung after antenatal diagnosis	Objective: We evaluated the outcome of fetuses diagnosed with having congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) on ultrasonographic examination and managed conservatively. Methods: A retrospective study of 19 cases of CCAM diagnosed antenatally in our hospital was conducted between 1990 and 2001. Complete clinical information was available for all patients, with a mean follow-up of 62 months. Results: The median gestational age at which CCAM was diagnosed was 23 weeks and there were eight live births. With conservative postnatal management, seven neonates had no major complications and one developed bronchopneumonia. Conclusion: Taken together, the findings of the present study and a review of the literature strongly support the conservative management of selected neonates with CCAM. © 2005 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

1842813924	Severe Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome Coexisting with a Bilateral Ectopic Pregnancy	Management of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) includes hospitalization for fluid and electrolyte management. Abdominal paracentesis is also used as minimally invasive form of management in selected cases of severe OHSS following ovulation induction. However, if pregnancy ensues, the syndrome persists for a longer period, and the clinical manifestations of severe OHSS could mask the picture of a bleeding gestational sac. It could-be easily overlooked unless the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy is kept in mind in cases of severe OHSS exacerbated by early pregnancy with or without a previous ectopic pregnancy history. We report a case of severe OHSS with simultaneous bilateral tubal pregnancy following intrauterine insemination (IUI). A 31-year-old woman with polycystic ovarian disease developed severe OHSS during the therapeutic course of IUI. An emergent exploratory laparotomy was performed 14 days after admission, and the operative findings showed persistent profuse bleeding from the bilateral fimbrial ends with marked enlargement of the ampullary portions. A linear salpingotomy was performed by a longitudinal incision along the area of maximal distension of the dilated fallopian tubes to preserve her fertility. We recommend that in cases of severe OHSS exacerbated by early pregnancy, serial serum β-hCG and transvaginal ultrasound follow-up may be necessary due to the potential association of severe OHSS in pregnancy with an ectopic pregnancy.

21044450820	Perinatal outcomes of polyhydramnios without associated congenital fetal anomalies after the gestational age of 20 weeks	Background: Polyhydramnios carries a high rate of complications during pregnancy and adverse perinatal outcomes. We could find no studies of this condition in a large Asian population. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the risks of adverse perinatal outcomes in a large study population with polyhydramnios without associated fetal anomalies after the gestational age of 20 weeks in Taiwan. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the computerized records of women who had babies without associated fetal anomalies after the gestational age of 20 weeks at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from July 1990 to December 2001. Possible confounding factors that could affect the occurrence of polyhydramnios were analyzed. We then investigated the relative risks of these events to adverse perinatal outcome by adjusting the variants. Results: Significantly higher incidences of preeclampsia, placental abruption, placenta accreta, past history of fetal death or preterm delivery, multiple pregnancy, body weight gain ≧ 20kg during pregnancy and primiparity were noted in patients with polyhydramnios than in patients without this condition. The presence of polyhydramnios significantly increased the rate of preterm delivery, low birth weight or very low birth weight, low one- and five-minute Apgar scores, fetal death, large for gestational age babies, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, Cesarean section, fetal distress in labor, NICU transfer and neonatal death. Conclusions: Polyhydramnios carried a higher incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes, such as low Apgar scores, fetal death, fetal distress in labor, NICU transfer and neonatal death, despite exclusion of congenital anomalies from the study population. Detailed antepartum fetal well-being surveillance, intensive intrapartum monitoring and further attention postpartum are warranted in patients with this condition.

0029778866	Metastatic choriocarcinoma with spontaneous splenic rupture following term pregnancy: A case report	Choriocarcinoma is a rare neoplasm which often spreads extensively. The metastases sometimes appear in the abdominal cavity where they can cause dramatic symptoms. We here describe a patient who had received a cesarean section twelve days before and intraperitoneal hemorrhage was diagnosed when she visited Chang Gung Memorial Hospital's emergency department. At laparotomy, ruptured spleen with active bleeding was found and splenectomy was performed. The histopathologic study revealed a metastatic choriocarcinoma. Multiagent chemotherapy was administered and the patient responded well. To our knowledge, this is the fourth reported case that metastatic choriocarcinoma resulted in spleen rupture presenting as the principal sign of acute hemoperitoneum. Metastatic choriocarcinoma with rupture should be considered a cause of intraperitoneal hemorrhage in women of child-bearing age.

0029794422	Prenatal diagnosis of major congenital cardiovascular malformations	This prospective study was designed to determine whether there would be a higher incidence of congenital cardiovascular malformation (CCVM) in pregnant women with certain risk factors. Fetal echocardiography, from second trimester to term, was performed in 1659 pregnant women with risk factors for CCVMs and 826 pregnant women without risk factors from March 1990 to April 1995. Two-dimensional imaging, fetal M mode measurements, Doppler waveform velocity and Doppler color flow mapping were used for fetal heart examination. During this period, 70 fetuses with major cardiovascular malformations were found. The prenatal detection rate was determined as 2.8% (70/2485) in our study. The rate in the high-risk group, however, was 3.7% (61/1659). Of all indications, fetal risk factors had the highest rate (9.3%, 46/494) of detected CCVMs. Maternal and familial indications could be excluded from the high-risk group as they did not show any increased incidence over the low-risk group. We suggest that fetal echocardiography is mandatory in the high-risk group, especially in cases with fetal and placental risk factors. Fetal cardiac screening in the hands of first-line sonographers has a major role in prenatal diagnosis of CCVMs in the low-risk group.

0030908429	Prediction of adverse perinatal outcome by maternal serum screening for Down syndrome in an Asian population	Objective: To investigate the association between adverse perinatal outcomes and abnormal elevations of serum marker levels (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP] and free β-hCG) or a false-positive screen for Down syndrome. Methods: Pregnancy outcome information was available for 5885 Taiwanese women under 33 years of age who had second-trimester maternal serum screening for Down syndrome, using AFP and free β-hCG, and delivered a chromosomally normal fetus. Those with AFP at least 2.0 multiples of the median (MoM), free β- hCG at least 2.5 MoM, or a false-positive screen (risk ratio at least 1:270) were identified, and the risk for adverse perinatal outcome was assessed. Results: A serum AFP level at least 2.0 MoM (n = 176, 3.0%) was significantly associated with the occurrence of preterm delivery, low Apgar scores, small- for-gestational-age infants, low birth weight or very low birth weight, fetal death, premature rupture of membranes, oligohydramnios, and a higher incidence of perinatal mortality. A serum free β-hCG level at least 2.5 MoM (n = 416, 7.1%) was significantly associated with low birth weight, an abnormally adherent placenta, and the occurrence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid. A higher incidence of fetal structural anomalies other than neural tube or abdominal wall defects, large-for-gestational-age infants, and postpartum hemorrhage was observed for a calculated risk of at least 1:270 (n = 311, 5.3%) independent of the other biochemical markers. Conclusion: Asian women with unexplained elevations of serum AFP or free β-hCG, or a false- positive screen for Down syndrome are at increased risk for various adverse perinatal outcomes. Careful fetal ultrasound examination and thoughtful strategy for perinatal management are warranted for these patients.

0030909649	Effects of glucose on placental hormones in the human term placenta in vitro	Glucose intake during pregnancy results in a decrease in endogenous insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1). However, the exact role of glucose on placental secretion of IGFBP-1 is unclear. This study was designed to investigate the direct effects of glucose on the production of IGFBP-1 and other placental hormones, using an isolated placental preparation. Using the dual recirculating perfusion system for an isolated human placenta lobule, a total of 43 experiments were performed over a duration of 6 hours. Twenty placentae were perfused with a medium containing 141 ± 10 mg/dL (7.83 ± 0.56 mmol/L) glucose (group I) and 23 placentae with 242 ± 12 mg/dL (13.43 ± 0.67 mmol/L) glucose (group II). Levels of insulin, glucose, lactate, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), IGFBP-1, human placental lactogen (hPL) and β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) were measured at 30 minute intervals during perfusion. Insulin and IGF-1 were barely detectable in the perfusates and their levels were not modulated by glucose. IGFBP-I was predominantly detected in the maternal rather than the fetal compartment of the placental circulation. Glucose increased the levels of IGFBP-1 in the maternal circulation in groups I and II during the first two hours of perfusion (188 ± 58% and 193 ± 31%, respectively). However, during the subsequent 4 hour period, the increase in IGFBP-1 concentration was significantly higher in group II (926 ± 427%) than in group I (428 ± 216%) (p < 0.05). There was no difference in the levels of hPL or β-hCG between the two groups in the maternal circulation. Thus, glucose stimulates the production of IGFBP-1 in the maternal circulation of a placenta in vitro. This increase in IGFBP-1 by glucose in vitro, as opposed to the decrease of IGFBP-1 in vivo, may be due to a lack of circulatory maternal insulin in the isolated placental preparation. These results also suggest that there may be a functional barrier within the placenta that prevents an increase in the level of IGFBP-1 in the fetal circulation.

0030916967	Maternal weight gain during pregnancy and risks of small for gestational age and large for gestational age newborn	Objective: To define maternal body weight gain using body mass index in term uncomplicated live singleton deliveries with appropriate birth weight for low, normal, and high body mass index women. To also define the risks of small for gestational age and large for gestational age in each group. Methods: This is a study of 16,332 pregnant women who delivered at Chang Gung medical center from July 1990 to December 1995. Study subjects were women who delivered uncomplicated live term singletons without fetal anomaly. Subjects were divided into three groups by pre-pregnant body mass index as body mass index < 19.8 (low body mass index, n = 7277), 19.8 ≤ body mass index ≤ 24.2 (normal body mass index, n = 7920), and body mass index > 24.2 (high body mass index, n = 1135). The birth weight and the increment of body mass index from pre-pregnancy to term was analyzed among the three body mass index groups. Results: The increments of body mass index were 5.962 ± 1.411, 5.837 ± 1.539, and 5.292 ± 1.627 in low, normal, and high body mass index, respectively, for each group to deliver an appropriate birth weight baby. The difference among each group is extremely significant (P < 0.001). For the mean body height of each group (158.8 cm (62.5 in), 158.0 cm (62.2 in), and 157.7 cm (62.1 in)) the increments of body weight were 15.03 kg (33.14 lb), 14.57 kg (32.12 lb), and 13.16 kg (29.01 lb) to term. Adjustment of body weight increment by 0.97 kg (2.14 lb), 0.95 kg (2.09 lb), and 0.86 kg (1.90 lb) for a 5-cm (2.0 in) difference in each group is necessary. There was a high degree of positive correlation between the increase in body mass index during gestation and the percentage of small for gestational age or large for gestational age babies delivered. Conclusions: A significant difference was observed in maternal body weight gain during pregnancy between pre-pregnancy low, normal, and high body mass index women who delivered singletons with appropriate birth weight for gestational age. Specific nutritional counseling programs for different groups according to pre-pregnancy body mass index are mandatory.

0031798786	Perinatal outcome of oligohydramnios without associated premature rupture of membranes and fetal anomalies	To investigate the perinatal outcome of patients with oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid index ≤ 5 cm), but without premature rupture of membranes and fetal congenital anomalies, data from 245 singleton pregnancies were analyzed and compared to those with normal amniotic fluid volumes (5 < amniotic fluid index < 24 cm, n = 27,261). Significantly higher incidences of primiparity, pregnancy-induced hypertension, premature separation of placenta, past history of intrauterine fetal death, past history of preterm delivery, postterm pregnancy, and advanced maternal age were noted to be associated with the occurrence of oligohydramnios. Pregnancies complicated by a markedly diminished amniotic fluid volume assessed antenatally by ultrasound were significantly more frequently associated with adverse perinatal outcomes such as preterm delivery, low or very low birth weight, low Apgar scores, intrauterine fetal death, small-for-gestational-age newborns, meconium staining, cesarean delivery, neonatal intensive care, and neonatal death.

0031892099	The antral follicle count predicts the outcome of pregnancy in a controlled ovarian hyperstimulation/intrauterine insemination program	Purpose: Our purpose was to test whether age-related changes in antral follicle counts can predict the pregnancy outcome in the early follicular phase of a controlled ovarian hyperstimulation/intrauterine insemination (COH/IUI) program. Methods: A selected group of 107 women (36 healthy women requesting child sex preselection, 52 women with unexplained infertility, and 19 with minimal endometriosis) who underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with clomiphene citrate (CC) plus human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) and subsequent intrauterine insemination were enrolled in the study. Transvaginal ultrasonography (7.0 MHz) was used to determine the total number of antral follicles (2-8 mm) in the right and left ovaries. The association among the antral follicle count, age, dominant follicle, and estradiol (E'2) level on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was analyzed. The association of the pregnancy rate and OHSS with the antral follicle count, dominant follicle count, and age was also examined. Results: The total antral follicle number decreased with age (P < O. 0001). Dominant follicle number increased with total antral follicle number in women who received CC plus hMGl IUI (P < 0.0001). The pregnant group had a higher number of antral follicle and dominant follicles in comparison with the nonpregnant group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.02, respectively). The E'2 level on the day of hCG injection increased positively with the total number of antral follicles (P < 0.0001) and the total number of dominant follicles (P < 0.0001). In women aged younger than 35 years, the pregnancy rate and dominant follicle number rose as the number of antral follicles increased (P < 0.03 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The pregnancy rate was low (2/39) in women aged older than 35 years regardless of the number of antral follicles (P < 0.05) and the extent of hMG administration (P < 0.02). Women aged older than 35 also produced fewer dominant follicles (P < 0.001). No pregnancy was achieved in a patient with an antral follicle number of less than five (17 cases). Conclusions: Age-related changes in antral follicle count significantly predicted the dominant follicle count and the pregnancy outcome. In women with antral follicle counts of less than five or who are older than 35 years, the application of COH/IUI may not be indicated.

0031897599	Use of the antral follicle count to predict the outcome of assisted reproductive technologies	Objective: To evaluate the predictive value of the antral follicle count in patients undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs). Design: Prospective study. Setting: Tertiary care institutional hospital. Patient(s): Consecutively seen patients undergoing ARTs such as IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian transfer, and tubal embryo transfer (TET). Intervention(s): The ovarian antral follicle number was determined by transvaginal ultrasonography on the first or second menstrual day, before the administration of gonadotropins, in patients undergoing ARTs. Main Outcome Measure(s): Ovulation induction was accomplished with the use of GnRH agonist down-regulation combined with FSH and menotropin stimulation. Gamete intrafallopian transfer or TET was performed in patients with patent fallopian tubes, and IVF-ET was undertaken in the remaining patients. Analysis of variance and Mantel-Haenszel monotonic test for trends were used for data analysis. Result(s): A total of 149 treatment cycles for 130 couples were performed during the study period. The procedures performed included 89 ETs, 26 gamete intrafallopian transfers, 13 TET cycles, and 21 incomplete cycles (9 poor responders, 6 failed retrievals, and 6 nonfertilization cycles). All treatment cycles were divided into three groups according to the number of antral follicles (i.e., ≤3, 4-10, and ≤11) to evaluate the influence of various factors. The antral follicle count correlated significantly with patient age, day 3 serum FSH level, use of gonadotropins, serum estradiol concentration, number of oocytes retrieved, and, later, number of oocytes or embryos transferred. The group of patients who had a lower antral follicle count also had a significantly higher rate of cycle cancellation compared with the other two groups (68.8% vs. 5.3% and 0, respectively). No pregnancies occurred in the low antral follicle count group, whereas there was a trend toward an increasing number of pregnancies per attempt as the number of antral follicles increased (0, 23.7%, and 36.8%, respectively). Conclusion(s): It is easy to determine the number of antral follicles with a diameter of 2-5 mm on the first or second day of menstruation, or just before the administration of exogenous gonadotropins. We were able to predict the ovarian response and pregnancy results of patients undergoing ARTs with the use of this simple procedure.

0031910370	Differential expression of interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 in human fetal serum and meconium-stained amniotic fluid	The study was designed to investigate the expression of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 in meconium-stained amniotic fluid and in fetal cord serum. Amniotic fluid and fetal cord serum specimens were collected from 10 and 9 women with meconium-stained and clear amniotic fluid, respectively, during Caesarian operation at labor. The mean concentrations of interleukin-1β found in clear and meconium-stained amniotic fluid were 10.0 and 54.5 pg/ml, respectively, and the difference was not statistically significant. On the other hand, the concentrations of interleukin-6 in meconium-stained amniotic fluid (774 pg/ml) was significantly higher than that found in clear amniotic fluid (149 pg/ml) (P = 0.0036). The differences of levels of both interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 in fetal cord serum specimens were not significant between neonates born to mothers with either clear or meconium-stained amniotic fluid (P = 0.8702 and 0.2987, respectively). The results of this study suggest that the production of at least one of the inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6, is associated with the meconium found in amniotic fluid.

0031655773	Prognostic factors for an unsatisfactory primary methotrexate treatment of cervical pregnancy: A quantitative review	To determine the risks when the primary methotrexate (MTX) treatment of cervical pregnancy has an unsatisfactory outcome, we conducted a Medline search on relevant literature published from January 1983 to June 1997. The search yielded 28 publications of 48 cases of cervical pregnancy. These and four new cases from our institutions were used in our study. A cervical pregnancy that presented with a serum β-human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration of ≤ 10,000 mIU/ml [odds ratio (OR) 10.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.59, 45.14], gestational age at ≤ 9 weeks (OR 6.44, 95% CI 1.46, 28.52), embryonic cardiac activity (OR 14.29, 95% CI 2.95, 76.92), and crown-rump length of > 10 mm (OR 13.33, 95% CI 1.46, 120.48) was considered to be associated with a higher unsatisfactory rate of primary MTX treatment. A concomitant feticide was found to enhance the therapeutic effect of MTX treatment if embryonic cardiac activity was evident (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02, 0.68). Administration of a high dose of MTX did not seem to be more effective than a lower one. Our findings supported some previous observations and, more importantly, provided useful clinical information in selecting appropriate candidates for MTX treatment in cases of cervical pregnancy.

23844493432	The evolving national birth prevalence of Down syndrome in Taiwan. A study on the impact of second-trimester maternal serum screening	Objectives: The aim of the present study was to determine whether the liberal use of second-trimester maternal serum screening in Taiwan started in 1994 had a measurable impact on birth prevalence of infants with Down syndrome (DS) in the past decade. Methods: We based our study on the databases of 'National Birth Defect Registration and Notification System', 'Amniocentesis in Pregnant Women', and 'Demographic Fact Book' in Taiwan. Collected data included total registered birth number, the registered number of stillbirths, the registered numbers of live births and of DS stillbirths affected with DS, amniocentesis rates each year in pregnant women aged 35 or more, and the age distribution of pregnant women in Taiwan. The live birth rate of and total birth rate of fetuses affected with DS, and the rates of live birth and stillbirth to total birth with DS, were analyzed year by year, in order to understand the change of birth rate of infants affected with DS between 1993 and 2001. Those with isolated cleft palate (ICP) were also analyzed as internal control variable. Confidence interval of live birth rate of infants with DS under Poisson distribution was calculated. Chi-square test for trend in binomial proportions was performed to see if there is an increasing (or decreasing) trend in the proportion of incidence of fetuses affected with DS. The difference was statistically significant if a p value was <0.05. Results: A total of 1 331 616 deliveries were collected during the study period, including 840 cases of DS confirmed by karyotyping study. A marked decrease in the live birth rates of case with DS occurred in 1994-95, from 0.63 per 1000 births to 0.23 per 1000 births. There was a crossover from more live births with DS to more stillbirths with DS during 1994 to 1996 after the implementation of second-trimester maternal serum screening for DS in 1994. In 1993, 76.9% of births diagnosed with DS were born alive, compared to 32.5% in 2001 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The policy of prenatal diagnosis program including amniocentesis for pregnant women aged 35 or more and the liberal application of maternal serum screening for DS in younger women was responsible for the marked decrease in the live births affected with DS in Taiwan from 1993 to 2001.

26944432317	Meigs' syndrome in a young woman with a normal serum CA-125 level	We report on a 27-year-old woman who presented with an ovarian solid tumor (20 × 15 cm) and massive ascites. A physical examination and chest X-ray revealed a moderate amount of pleural effusion on the right side. Cytologic study of the pleural effusion showed reactive mesothelial cells without evidence of malignancy. Gram's stain was negative. The blood chemistry was within normal limits. The serum CA-125 level was 22 (normal, < 35) U/ml, the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was 8 (normal, < 20) ng/ml, and the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was 0.5 (normal, < 5) ng/ml. An explorative laparotomy revealed approximately 1500 ml of serous ascites and a very large multilobulated left adnexal mass (20 × 15 cm) with no malignant cytology in the ascitic fluid. Postoperatively, the pleural effusion spontaneously resolved, and the microscopic examination revealed a benign fibroma-thecoma, confirming the diagnosis of Meigs' syndrome. The symptoms resolved after removal of this pelvic tumor. This is an unusual case of a young female with Meigs' syndrome and a normal serum CA-125 level.

33747002234	Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha Converting Enzyme in Human Gestational Tissues from Pregnancies Complicated by Chorioamnionitis	Chorioamnionitis increases the risk of preterm labour and is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes including cerebral palsy. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) derived from the gestational tissues (placenta, fetal membranes and maternal decidua) is thought to play a pivotal role in the induction of cytokine response in chorioamnionitis. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) is essential for the release of TNF-α. Our aim was to determine whether the expression of TACE is increased in human gestational tissues from pregnancies complicated by chorioamnionitis, and whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes increased expression of TACE in the human gestational tissues in vitro. The immunostaining of TACE was generally more intense, in particular in the syncytiotrophoblast and stromal cells, in villous samples from pregnancies complicated by chorioamnionitis than those from normal pregnancies. Increased immunoreactivity of TACE was also noted in the amnion and choriodecidua. In parallel, there was an increased infiltration of monocytes/macrophages within the villous stroma and choriodecidua. As a complement to our in vivo findings, LPS significantly increased the levels of mRNA and protein of TACE in a dose-dependent response in villous and fetal membrane explant cultures. Together, our results imply a potential role of TACE in the pathogenesis of chorioamnionitis. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33749469852	Assessing Ovarian Reserve in Women After Laparoscopic Surgery for Ovarian Endometriosis	Objective: A retrospective study to evaluate the ovarian reserve via antral follicle counts and basal hormone changes in infertile patients who had previously undergone laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometriosis. Materials and Methods: Infertile women who had undergone laparoscopy for ovarian endometriosis were enrolled and divided into four groups according to the ovarian surgical procedure, determined by the degree of the invading lesion: bipolar cauterization of the superficial ovarian endometriosis (group A), cystectomy of the endometrioma with a diameter of less than 5 cm (group B) or a diameter of at least 5 cm (group C), or unilateral oophorectomy (group D). Follow-up statistics included basal serum hormone levels and ovarian antral follicle counts, which were determined about 12 months after surgery. Results: The study included 233 women. We found a significant difference in remaining antral follicle counts in groups A, B, C, and D: 11.1 ± 3.5, 9.4 ± 3.1, 7.5 ± 2.3, and 4.0 ± 2.0, respectively (p < 0.001). There was no difference in day 3 follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels: 6.2 ± 2.0, 6.2 ± 2.8, 6.3 ± 2.2, and 7.8 ± 2.1 IU/L in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. Significantly higher basal FSH levels were noted when comparing group D with groups A, B, and C (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Ovarian endometrioma cystectomy or oophorectomy damages the ovarian reserve. Damage to the vascular system and the cortex of the ovary during surgery might accelerate depletion of the follicular pool. The FSH level is compromised significantly until the follicular pool is depleted below a certain threshold. This might be because of various components controlling FSH modulation, mainly inhibin but possibly other steroids and peptides influenced by extraovarian mechanisms or the aging of neuroendocrine tissues. © 2004 Taiwan Association of Obstetric & Gynecology.

33847413225	Risk factors for placenta previa in an Asian population	Objective: To identify the risk factors for placenta previa in an Asian population. Methods: This retrospective cohort study involved Taiwanese women delivered between July 1990 and December 2003 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. Pregnancies complicated by multiple gestation and fetal anomalies were excluded. Results: There were 457 cases of placenta previa (1.2%) among the 37,702 pregnancies analyzed. Risk factors for placenta previa included a prior preterm birth (OR, 6.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-10.6); technology-assisted conception (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.9-7.8); smoking (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2-9.1) or working (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.8-5.3) during pregnancy; maternal age of, or greater than 35 years (OR, 2.0 to 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.7); and previous induced abortions (OR, 1.3-3.0; 95% CI, 1.1-7.1). Conclusion: The risk factors for placenta previa were found to be the same for Asian women as those previously recorded for American and European women, but additional factors were detected. © 2007 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

34548329744	Management of primary abdominal pregnancy: Twelve years of experience in a medical centre	Background. The aim of this study was to evaluate our institution's 12-year experience in managing primary abdominal pregnancy by laparotomy or laparoscopy. Methods. We identified 11 cases of primary abdominal pregnancy treated at our institution between January 1994 and December 2005, and separated the cases into 2 groups based on type of surgical management. The outcome measures we evaluated were operative time, blood loss and duration of hospital stay. In addition, the incidence rates for all types of ectopic pregnancy were recorded. Analysis excluded secondary abdominal pregnancy. Results. Of the 11 primary abdominal pregnancies, 6 were treated with laparotomy and 5 with laparoscopy. The laparoscopy group had significantly better results in operative time, blood loss and hospital stay (p<0.05). The difference in gestational age was not significant (p=0.141), even after excluding the patient whose abdominal pregnancy was only identified after cesarean delivery. Conclusion. Our experience shows a trend toward better management of primary abdominal pregnancy with laparoscopy. These patients had shorter operative time, reduced blood loss, and fewer days in hospital then patients treated with laparotomy. Choice of management should depend on the patient's condition, gestational age of the pregnancy, and the physician's clinical experience. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.

34648846618	Risk factors for placental abruption in an Asian population	The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for placental abruption in an Asian population. The authors conducted a retrospective review of 37 245 Taiwanese women who delivered between July 1990 and December 2003. Pregnancies complicated by placenta previa, multiple gestation, and fetal anomalies were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for potentially confounding variables and to identify independent risk factors for placental abruption. Three hundred thirty-two women had placental abruption (9 per 1000 singleton deliveries). Women who smoked during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 8.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.0-23.9), had gestational hypertensive diseases (adjusted OR = 4.9; 95% CI = 3.3-7.3), pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios (adjusted OR = 4.2; 95% CI = 2.7-6.7), polyhydramnios (adjusted OR = 3.3; 95% CI = 1.4-7.7), preterm premature rupture of membranes (adjusted OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.1-3.1), entanglement of umbilical cord (adjusted OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2-2.1), were of or more than 35 years of age (adjusted OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.0), and had a low prepregnancy body mass index (adjusted OR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0-1.6) were at increased risk for placental abruption. Some risk factors for placental abruption among Taiwanese women are the same as those of other ethnic groups, whereas some of the risk factors are different. © 2007 by the Society for Gynecologic Investigation.

36248943188	Maternal anxiety about first trimester nuchal translucency screening and impact of positive screening results	Background. To assess pre- and post-procedural maternal anxiety about nuchal translucency thickness screening for Down syndrome in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the psychological impact of positive screening results. Methods. A total of 172 women whose screens were positive for excess fetal nuchal translucency thickness, and 180 women whose screens were within normal limits (controls) were recruited. Anxiety levels were measured with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory just before screening, 1 week after screening, at 22 weeks' gestation, and 6 weeks after delivery. After delivery, all women were asked to respond using a Likert-type scale regarding their attitudes toward fetal nuchal translucency screening. Results. Women with positive screening results reported significantly greater psychological distress on state-anxiety scores after the full report was received. The trait- and state-anxiety scores before screening, at 22 weeks' gestation, and after delivery did not differ between groups. Both groups of women were strongly positive about nuchal translucency screening, both in the current pregnancy and in future pregnancies. Conclusion. Women with positive screening results did not have a sustained increase in anxiety and remained supportive about the value of screening. Clinician concerns about causing maternal anxiety should not be an impediment to screening. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.

38049071433	Risk factors for spontaneous preterm delivery before 34 weeks of gestation among Taiwanese women	Objective: To identify the risk factors for spontaneous preterm delivery before 34 weeks of gestation among Taiwanese women. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study involved 36,453 Taiwanese women who delivered between July 1990 and December 2003. Pregnancies complicated by multiple gestation, fetal anomalies, and iatrogenic preterm births due to maternal or fetal indications were excluded. Results: Five hundred and five spontaneous preterm deliveries (1.4%) were identified. Risk factors for early preterm delivery included a prior preterm delivery (odds ratio [OR], 16.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.1-24.6), placental abruption (OR, 13.4; 95% CI, 9.4-19.2), history of fetal demise (OR, 11.8; 95% CI, 7.7-18.0), chorioamnionitis (OR, 10.5; 95% CI, 7.4-14.9), oligohydramnios (OR, 10.1; 95% CI, 6.7-15.3), history of abruption (OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.4-26.0), unmarried (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.9-13.2), conception by reproductive technology (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-5.5), maternal age less than 20 years (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.8-6.7), maternal age greater than 34 years (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1), three or more abortions (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.9-2.3), and premature rupture of membranes (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-2.0). Conclusion: Some of the risk factors for early preterm delivery among Taiwanese women were the same as those of other ethnic groups, whereas some of the other risk factors were different.

0032854784	Effect of a sonographically diffusely enlarged uterus without distinct uterine masses on the outcome of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer	Purpose: Our objective was to study the effect of a sonographically diffusely enlarged uterus without distinct uterine masses on the outcome of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET). Methods: Nineteen primary infertility patients undergoing IVF-ET who had a sonographically diffusely enlarged uterus without distinct uterine masses were enrolled. An age- controlled group of 144 primary infertility patients undergoing IVF-ET with a normal uterus and no history of uterine surgery was included. Results: The age, day 3 follicle stimulating hormone, antral follicle count, ovarian response, endometrial thickness, number of retrieved and fertilized oocytes, number of transferred embryos, clinical pregnancy rate, and total delivery rate were not statistically different between the two groups (P > 0.05). Patients with a sonographically diffused enlarged uterus without distinct uterine masses had a higher spontaneous abortion rate (66. 7%) than controls (P < 0.04; odds ratio = 7.5;95% confidence interval, 1.16-48.56). Conclusions: A high spontaneous abortion rate was found in patients with a sonographically diffusely enlarged uterus without distinct uterine masses undergoing IVF-ET. Enhanced luteal support was required.

0032915586	Tumor vascular pattern and blood flow impedance in the differential diagnosis of leiomyoma and adenomyosis by color Doppler sonography	Purpose: Our objective was to evaluate the differences between leiomyoma and adenomyosis by color Doppler sonography with new criteria. Methods: A total of 78 patients with symptomatic uterine nodularities who were sonographically suspected to have leiomyoma or adenomyosis without other coexisting pathologic conditions was enrolled in the study. All patients underwent transvaginal color Doppler sonography (7.0-MHz vaginal probe) or transabdominal color Doppler sonography (5.0 MHz) during the early follicular phase. The morphology, tumor vascular pattern, and blood flow impedance of the uterine tumors were measured. All of the patients underwent surgery and the pathologic reports were used as references. Results: The mean age was not statistically significant in patients with adenomyosis versus leiomyoma (P > 0.05). The morphologic criteria for adenomyosis and leiomyoma by sonography detected 79% of adenomyosis and 84% of leiomyoma. Adenomyosis had 87% randomly scattered vessels or intratumoral signals and 88% of leiomyomas showed peripheral scattered vessels or outer feeding vessels. Eighty-two percent of adenomyoses had a pulsitility index (PI) of arteries within or around uterine tumors >1.17 and 84% of leiomyomas had a PI ≤ 1.17. The reliability test of tumor vascular pattern and blood flow impedance were better than that of using morphological criteria alone. Conclusions: With the aid of color Doppler sonography, tumor vascular pattern and blood flow impedance of the arteries within or around uterine tumors could more accurately diagnose adenomyosis and leiomyoma in addition to the morphologic criteria on transvaginal sonography.

0032916686	Delivery of a severely anaemic fetus after partial molar pregnancy: Clinical and ultrasonographic findings	The incidence of a normal live fetus and a partial molar placenta is extremely rare. Although triploidy is the most frequent association, a fetus with normal karyotype can survive in cases of partial molar pregnancy. We report a case of partial molar placenta in which a live female baby was delivered at 32 weeks gestation by a 30-year-old woman. At the 18th week, ultrasonographic examination revealed a normal fetus with a huge, multicystic placenta. Chromosomal evaluation by amniocentesis revealed a normal female karyotype (46,XX), and serial biometric measurement of the fetus showed normal growth during pregnancy. There were no obstetric complications until the 32nd gestational week when preterm rupture of the membranes occurred. The electronic fetal heart beat tracing showed a repeated sinusoid pattern and late deceleration after admission. The patient underwent emergency Caesarean section and delivered a 1551-g, anaemic female baby with an Apgar score of 1, 4 and 6 at 1, 5 and 10 min, respectively. The baby recovered within 2 weeks after respiratory support and transfusion of packed red blood cells. Although anaemia is one of the risk factors that jeopardize the fetus in the case of partial molar pregnancy, termination is not indicated when the fetus is normal and no complications have occurred.

0032973768	Risk factors for placenta accreta	Objective: To identify risk factors associated with placenta accreta in a large cohort study. Methods: Data for this study came from the Taiwan Down Syndrome Screening Group, an ongoing project on feasibility of serum screening in an Asian population. Women who had serum screening for Down syndrome at 14-22 weeks' gestation using alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and free β- hCG between January 1994 and June 1997, and delivered in the same institution, were included (n = 10,672). Those who had multiple gestations (n = 200), overt diabetes (n = 11), or fetal malformations (n = 101) were excluded. If a woman was involved more than once, one randomly selected pregnancy was included in the analysis (n = 9349). Twenty-eight pregnancies were complicated by placenta accreta, diagnosed by clinical presentation (n = 26) or histologic confirmation (n = 2). Multiple logistic regression with adjustment for potentially confounding variables was used to identify independent risk factors for placenta accreta. Results: Women who had placenta previa (odds ratio [OR] 54.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 17.8, 165.5) and second-trimester serum levels of AFP and free β-hCG greater than 2.5 multiples of the median (OR 8.3; 95% CI 1.8, 39.3 and OR 3.9; 95% CI 1.5, 9.9, respectively), and were 35 years and older (OR 3.2; 95% CI 1.1, 9.4) were at increased risk of having placenta accreta. Conclusion: Risk factors for placenta accreta include placenta previa, abnormally elevated second- trimester AFP and free β-hCG levels, and advanced maternal age.

0034046416	Spleen laceration, a rare complication of laparoscopy	A 31-year-old woman had secondary infertility of 4 years' duration. Hysterosalpingography revealed bilateral distal tubal occlusion with bilateral hydrosalpinx-like appearance. At laparoscopy, both oviducts were occluded with marked hydropic change. Salpingoplasty was performed to correct bilateral hydrosalpinges and reform the fimbriated tubal ends. The procedure was performed uneventfully by an experienced surgeon in 45 minutes. Nine hours after the operation an emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed due to massive intraabdominal bleeding. The cause was a small tear, 3 cm long and 1 cm deep, with active bleeding in the inferior splenic tail. The laceration was repaired successfully with 1-0 chromic suture. The etiology of splenic laceration during laparoscopic surgery is uncertain. Many complications of laparoscopy are physiologic, and this one might have occurred while establishing pneumoperitoneum. Distortion and stretching of small vascular adhesions of the spleen with the abdominal wall also may have played a role. Gynecologists must be aware of the physiologic insult to patients during laparoscopy.

40949084803	Tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme in the human placenta throughout gestation	Ectodomain shedding of epidermal growth factor receptor ligands such as transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HBEGF), and amphiregulin (AREG) is considered to be important during implantation. Tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE) has been suggested as the major sheddase for these molecules. The objectives of this study are (1) to characterize the expression of TACE in the human placenta throughout gestation; (2) to determine the association between the expression of TACE with TGF-α, HBEGF, and AREG; (3) to ascertain whether TACE mediates TGF-α, HBEGF, and AREG shedding; and (4) to examine the effect of hypoxia on the expression of TACE. By analyzing a total of 55 villous samples representing different gestational ages, the authors found that TACE was continuously expressed in the placentas throughout gestation and that the levels of TACE were positively correlated with the levels of TGF-α, HBEGF, and AREG. Preadministration of a TACE inhibitor in villous explant cultures or transfection of cytotrophoblastic cells with TACE-specific small interference RNA decreased the shedding of HBEGF and AREG. Moreover, hypoxia (2% O

33344458866	An appropriate indicator for diagnosing gestational diabetes	Background: This study was intended to simplify the diagnostic procedure for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) through using a single plasma glucose level, after a 100 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), as the most appropriate indicator for diagnosing GDM in pregnant women with a positive 50 g, 1-hour oral glucose challenge test (GCT) in Northern Taiwan. Methods: A total of 973 native Taipei metropolitan pregnant women with a positive GCT, who underwent a 100 g, 3-hour OGTT were retrospectively surveyed. GDM was defined according to the standards of National Diabetes Data Group. Plasma glucose levels, obtained 1 hour following a GCT and at multiple timing following a 100 g oral glucose load, were used to plot receiver operative characteristic curves to determine the most appropriate indicator for diagnosing GDM. Results: In the 973 pregnant women with a positive GCT, a 2-hour plasma glucose level above 165 mg/dl revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 91.2% and 90.3%, respectively. Conclusions: To simplify the diagnostic procedure for GDM, we suggest that a 2-hour plasma glucose level above 165 mg/dl after a 100 g OGTT might be an appropriate indicator for diagnosing GDM in women with a positive GCT.

41149118424	Parental decisions regarding prenatally detected fetal sex chromosomal abnormality and the impact of genetic counselling: An analysis of 57 cases in Taiwan	Objective: To analyse parental decisions regarding pregnancies with sex chromosome abnormalities (SCA). Methods: Collected and reviewed records from our hospital for 1991-2005. Genetic counselling was provided by obstetricians or perinatologists. Result: Among 57 fetuses with SCA were 36 non-mosaic cases (four of 36, 45,X; 12 of 36, 47,XXY; seven of 36, 47,XYY, 13 of 36, 47,XXX) and 21 mosaic cases (15 of 21, 45,X mosaicism). Only 20% of 45,X mosaic pregnancies were continued, whereas all other mosaic pregnancies (100%) were continued (P = 0.004). Of 32 SCA cases counselled by a perinatologist, 66% (21 of 32) were continued. In contrast, 36% (nine of 25) of cases counselled by a general obstetrician were continued, a barely significant difference (P = 0.048). More couples chose to continue pregnancies in recent years. Conclusion: Genetic counselling by well-trained specialists is valuable, and the trend towards fewer terminations at our centre suggests improved parental knowledge of pathology associated with SCA. © 2008 The Authors.

59449089815	Measurement of nuchal volume in the first trimester Down screening using three-dimensional ultrasound	Objectives Screening of fetuses at 11 to 14 weeks of gestation for Down syndrome using stored volumes acquired by a three-dimensional (3D) scanner. Method Thirty-four healthy singleton fetuses were recruited consecutively and prospectively during routine first trimester scans in our unit. Two-dimensional (2D) images of nuchal translucency (NT), crown-rump length (CRL), and biparietal diameter (BPD) were obtained by following a standard protocol. The volume of the nuchal area (NV) was obtained by a 3D scanning machine. Results The mean time to perform a 2D first trimester scan was 15.3 min, while the mean time to obtain and examine the stored volumes was 11.1 min (p < 0.001) in a 3D scan. There were no significant differences in NT, CRL, and BPD between the two groups. Two cases with an NT thickness > 2.5 mm also revealed increased volume data in the nuchal area. The Pearson's correlations between NT and CRL, BPD and CRL, NT and NV, and NV and CRL were moderate-to-high positive. Conclusion The nuchal volume data and the standard curve in the first trimester may be possible markers for Down syndrome screening. 3D scans can also minimize the scanning time, providing views not easily following strict NT guidelines.

77954234089	Timing the delivery of preterm fetus: A case study based on computer simulation	The propagation of blood flow along the fetoplacental arterial system has been hypothesized to have a compensatory response to placental anomalies that may result in fetal stress. When the placenta generates increased resistance, the umbilical artery blood flow would decrease and in the worst scenario become absent, which will lead to fetal asphyxia and hypoxia. To compensate for the decreased oxygen supply from maternal placenta, the fetal middle cerebral arteries would become dilated leading to an increased diastolic flow, hence more oxygen. This compensatory phase, however, only lasts for a certain period of time, after which the hypoxia may lead to fetal demise or long term irreversible organ damages. In high-risk pregnancies, Doppler ultrasound technology is commonly used to monitor the fetoplacental arterial blood flow to assess fetal well being. If the anomalies occur prior to the end of the 40-week of gestation, surgical or aggressive medical intervention might be necessary to save the fetal life. Timing this intervention, however, is complex due to the fine balancing act to minimize potential risks from prematurity and organ damage vs. rescuing a fetal life through cesarean section or aggressive medical treatment or natural delivery at the earliest possible gestational age. A reasonable goal is to allow the pregnancy to continue to the point just before fetal damage occurs. To achieve that goal, various testing criteria, e.g. venous Doppler and fetal heart rate, have been used to identify de-compensation. In this work, we conducted computer simulation of the fetoplacental arterial blood flow of a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) pregnancy based on Doppler blood flow readings taken during the 10-day period prior to the delivery. The simulation suggests that timing the delivery based on either Doppler waveform readings or fetal heart rates give similar pregnancy outcome.

42449147074	Risk factors for recurrence of group b streptococcus colonization in a subsequent pregnancy	OBJECTIVE: To document rates of recurrent group B streptococci (GBS) colonization in women with previous GBS colonization in an initial pregnancy and to assess maternal risk factors associated with recurrence. METHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal study was performed in a teaching hospital on women with GBS colonization who were pregnant between 2002 and 2006 and had at least one subsequent pregnancy during the same time period. When only the index and first subsequent pregnancy were analyzed, the cohort included 251 women. The rate of recurrence was estimated for GBS colonization in the pregnancy after the index pregnancy for GBS colonization. Multivariable regression models were constructed to model recurrence of GBS colonization in a subsequent pregnancy as functions of potential predictors to estimate relative risks and confidence intervals. RESULTS: The rate of recurrence of GBS colonization in the pregnancy subsequent to the index pregnancy was 38.2% (95% confidence interval 33.5-42.9%). Multivariable regression models showed that the time interval between the two pregnancies and the intensity of GBS colonization from the index pregnancy were predictive of recurrent GBS colonization. CONCLUSION: More than one third of women had recurrent GBS colonization in a subsequent pregnancy. These findings should assist clinicians in counseling women with GBS colonization about their risk for recurrence, the importance of appropriate prenatal GBS screening in a subsequent pregnancy, and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for unknown GBS status. © 2008 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

4344582885	Recent advances in Down syndrome screening	Maternal serum screening for Down syndrome has been developed since 1994 in Taiwan. A prospective collaborative study has been conducted in Taiwan to compare the two-analyte screening strategy combining serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), either with total human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or free β-hCG, and with maternal age. The results confirmed that maternal serum screening for Down syndrome could also achieve a 60% detection rate at a 5% false-positive rate in Asians. In addition, abnormal elevation of serum markers for Down syndrome screening has been reported to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Thus, women with unexplained elevations of serum markers at increased risk for various adverse outcomes. Careful fetal ultrasound examination and thoughtful strategy for perinatal management are recommended for these patients. There are several benefits including no invasion, easy collection and high acceptability by using urine instead of serum. Our previous studies confirmed that maternal urine screening for Down syndrome using free β-hCG or beta core fragment of hCG (β-core) in combination with total estriol (E

Method From January 2005 to December 2006, 2782 women undergoing prenatal biochemical serum screening were randomized into fast reporting by SMS (group A) or without mobile phone reporting (group B). Anxiety levels were measured with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before prenatal screen testing, before the appointed clinic (when the SMS report had already been given to group A), and 3 days after the appointed clinic (when the full screening report had been given to groups A and B). Results For screen-negative women, anxiety scores did not differ between groups before prenatal screen testing and 3 days after the appointed clinic. The state-anxiety scores measured on the second occasion had declined significantly in group A. The state-anxiety scores in both groups increased over the 3-week period after being informed of positive screen results. The trait- and state-anxiety scores at all points did not differ between the two groups of screen-positive women. Conclusions The provision of a routine reporting system plus additional SMS report revealed some overall benefits in reducing anxiety among women with screen-negative result.

52349085836	X pentasomy in an intracytoplasmic sperm injection pregnancy detected by nuchal translucency testing	Althoughmaternally derived X pentasomy following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is rare, prenatal detection of a case offers insight into etiology and diagnosis. A 29-year-old gravida 1 whose pregnancy resulted from ICSI was referred for ultrasound screening at 11 weeks' gestation. Nuchal translucency thickness was 3.2 mm, and the fetal nasal bone was absent. Subsequent evaluation revealed karyotype 49,XXXXX. DNA microsatellite analysis showed the extra X chromosomes were maternal in origin. Termination of pregnancy was performed at 15 weeks. Because of the increased risk of sex chromosomal abnormalities in ICSI pregnancies, patients should be counseled prior to fertilization and standard prenatal care should include nuchal translucency measurement and any other elements necessary for indicated pregnancies to obtain a diagnosis.

67349239974	Effectiveness of ultrasound-guided aspiration and sclerotherapy with 95% ethanol for treatment of recurrent ovarian endometriomas	Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of transvaginal ultrasound aspiration and ethanol sclerotherapy in patients with recurrent ovarian endometriomas. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Teaching hospital affiliated with Chang Gung University, Taipei. Patient(s): Patients (n = 108) with recurrent ovarian endometriomas ≥3 cm. Intervention(s): Preoperative evaluation of previous pathology, midcycle serum CA-125 level, and color Doppler ultrasonography to exclude possibility of malignancies. After aspiration, sclerotherapy with 95% ethanol irrigation of the cystic cavity was performed (group 1, n = 78, 0-10 minutes of retention; group 2, n = 30, ethanol left in situ [retention]). Main Outcome Measure(s): Ultrasonography was performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to determine persistence and size of cysts and the number of antral follicles. Pelvic pain score was also determined at those time points. Result(s): The 1-year recurrence rate for group 2 patients was significantly lower than for group 1 patients (13.3% vs. 32.1%). Antral follicle count was increased and pain score was decreased in both groups to a similar level. No significant change in CA-125 was observed. Conclusion(s): Ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy with 95% ethanol is an effective therapy for ovarian endometriomas. Retention of ethanol is more effective than irrigation only. © 2009 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

72049091762	Advanced maternal age and adverse perinatal outcomes in an Asian population	Objective: To investigate (1) whether there is an increasing trend in the mean maternal age at the birth of the first child and in the group of women giving birth at age 35 or older, and (2) the association between advanced maternal age and adverse perinatal outcomes in an Asian population. Study design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 39,763 Taiwanese women who delivered after 24 weeks of gestation between July 1990 and December 2003. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounding variables. Results: During the study period, the mean maternal age at the birth of the first child increased from 28.0 to 29.7 years, and the proportion of women giving birth at age 35 or older increased from 11.4% to 19.1%. Compared to women aged 20-34 years, women giving birth at age 35 or older carried a nearly 1.5-fold increased risk for pregnancy complications and a 1.6-2.6-fold increased risk for adverse perinatal outcomes. After adjusting for the confounding effects of maternal characteristics and coexisting pregnancy complications, women aged 35-39 years were at increased risk for operative vaginal delivery (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-1.7) and cesarean delivery (adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5-1.7), while women aged 40 years and older were at increased risk for preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation) (adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.2), operative vaginal delivery (adjusted OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.0-4.6), and cesarean delivery (adjusted OR 2.6, 95% CI 2.2-3.1). In those women who had a completely uncomplicated pregnancy and a normal vaginal delivery, advanced maternal age was still significantly associated with early preterm delivery (before 34 weeks of gestation), a birth weight <1500 g, low Apgar scores, fetal demise, and neonatal death. Conclusion: In this population of Taiwanese women, there is an increasing trend in the mean maternal age at the birth of the first child. Furthermore, advanced maternal age is independently associated with specific adverse perinatal outcomes. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

77349124422	Difference in nuchal translucency between monozygotic and dizygotic spontaneously conceived twins	Objective: To assess nuchal translucency (NT) thickness and differences in inter-twin NT thickness among naturally conceived monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Methods: Enrolled women prospectively underwent NT measurement for both twins between 11 and 14 weeks of gestational age. NT thickness and inter-twin NT difference were recorded and compared among dizygotic twins, monozygotic dichorionic twins, and monozygotic monochorionic twins. Results: This study obtained analyzable data for 174 monozygotic twins and 107 dizygotic twins. Of the 174 monozygotic twins, 105 were monochorionic, and 69 were dichorionic. Monozygotic monochorionic twin pregnancies had a significantly higher mean fetal NT thickness (1.48 ± 0.62 mm) than either dizygotic twin pregnancies (1.34 ± 0.50 mm) or monozygotic dichorionic twin pregnancies (1.31 ± 0.48 mm). Mean inter-twin NT difference was significantly lower in monozygotic dichorionic twin pregnancies (0.37 ± 0.19 mm) than in dizygotic twin pregnancies (0.57 ± 0.22 mm) or monochorionic twin pregnancies (0.65 ± 0.43 mm).Irrespective of twin zygosity, NT thickness and inter-twin NT difference were larger in monochorionic twins than in dichorionic twins (1.48 ± 0.62 mm versus 1.33 ± 0.49 mm, and 0.65 ± 0.43 mm versus 0.49 ± 0.23 mm, respectively). Conclusion: During first-trimester ultrasonographic screening for Down syndrome, monochorionic twin pregnancies have the greatest NT thickness and monozygotic dichorionic twin pregnancies have the lowest inter-twin NT difference.

77949387122	A Longitudinal study of oxidative stress and antioxidant status in women with uncomplicated pregnancies throughout gestation	Pregnancy is associated with increased oxidative stress, and exaggeration of oxidative damage is considered important in pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia. There is, however, only scattered information regarding the longitudinal change of oxidative stress during pregnancy. We surmised that the placenta is the cause of the increased oxidative stress during pregnancy and hypothesized that the amount of placenta-derived cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma is correlated with maternal oxidative stress status. Blood and urine samples were collected at different stages of gestation and 6 to 8 weeks postpartum from 105 women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Additionally, 40 healthy women of reproductive age, but not pregnant, were recruited as controls. All oxidative stress markers, including urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), plasma 8-isoprostane, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, were increased in the third trimester, and most of them returned to nonpregnant levels postpartum. Furthermore, the DYS14 gene of the Y chromosome was quantified from plasma samples obtained at 26 to 30 weeks' gestation in 54 women who later delivered a male infant. Significant associations were noted between plasma concentrations of the DYS14 gene and the levels of urinary 8-OHdG and plasma 8-isoprostane, suggesting an association between the breakdown of syncytiotrophoblast and maternal oxidative stress during pregnancy.

77952346171	Effect of maternal hepatitis B carrier status on first-trimester markers of down syndrome	Up to 10% of women of reproductive age in our country are carriers of hepatitis B virus. This study examined whether maternal hepatitis B carrier status has any effect on markers used in first-trimester screening for Down syndrome. Records for 2 major Taiwanese hospitals were retrospectively examined to identify women with singleton pregnancies resulting in normal live births from June 2002 through 2008. Maternal hepatitis B data were used to define 3 groups: seronegative women, inactive carrier women, and active carrier women. Women with active or inactive carrier status were significantly older than seronegative women. The results of the study show that maternal hepatitis B carrier status does not influence first-trimester levels of maternal serum free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (free ?2-hCG) multiples of the median (MoM), pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) MoM, and median fetal nuchal translucency and screening false-positive rate; therefore, correction in the risk calculation algorithm for maternal hepatitis B carrier status is not necessary. © 2010 The Author(s).

77955056791	Factors influencing women's decisions regarding pertussis vaccine: A decision-making study in the Postpartum Pertussis Immunization Program of a teaching hospital in Taiwan	We conducted surveys to determine factors influencing women's decisions to accept or decline postpartum pertussis (Tdap) vaccination. Survey response rate among eligible individuals was 97%. Of respondents, 53% accepted and 47% declined postpartum Tdap. Women, who declined vaccination were more likely to rate maternal or infant risk of exposure to pertussis as low, report that they did not trust information about postpartum pertussis vaccination, and report being very concerned about the safety of the vaccine. Awareness about pertussis, its risk to infants, and prevention via vaccination need to be further increased among women of child-bearing age, particularly pregnant women. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77957877859	Differential effects of Concomitant use of vitamins C and E on trophoblast apoptosis and autophagy between normoxia and hypoxia-reoxygenation	Background: Concomitant supplementation of vitamins C and E during pregnancy has been reportedly associated with low birth weight, the premature rupture of membranes and fetal loss or perinatal death in women at risk for preeclampsia; however, the cause is unknown. We surmise that hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) within the intervillous space due to abnormal placentation is the mechanism and hypothesize that concomitant administration of aforementioned vitamin antioxidants detrimentally affects trophoblast cells during HR. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using villous explants, concomitant administration of 50 mM of vitamins C and E was observed to reduce apoptotic and autophagic changes in the trophoblast layer at normoxia (8% oxygen) but to cause more prominent apoptosis and autophagy during HR. Furthermore, increased levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in association with a decrease in the autophagy-related protein LC3-II were noted in cytotrophoblastic cells treated with vitamins C and E under standard culture conditions. In contrast, vitamin treatment decreased Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as well as increased mitochondrial Bak and cytosolic LC3-II in cytotrophoblasts subjected to HR. Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate that concomitant administration of vitamins C and E has differential effects on the changes of apoptosis, autophagy and the expression of Bcl-2 family of proteins in the trophoblasts between normoxia and HR. These changes may probably lead to the impairment of placental function and suboptimal growth of the fetus. © 2010 Hung et al.

78650127276	Maternal homocysteine level and markers used in first-trimester screening for fetal down syndrome	This study examined possible relationships between homocysteine and markers used in first-trimester screening for Down syndrome. Pregnancies were categorized into 4 groups according to quartile ranking of maternal plasma homocysteine concentration. Of the 595 pregnancies, 147 were assigned to group 1 (homocysteine level 0.6-3.5 μmol/L), 156 to group 2 (homocysteine level 3.6-4.5 μmol/L), 142 to group 3 (homocysteine level 4.6-5.6 μmol/L), and 150 pregnancies to group 4 (homocysteine level 5.7-12.6 μmol/L). No significant difference in mean nuchal translucency and mean free β-human chorionic gonadotropin (free-βhCG) multiples of the median (MoM) levels were observed. However, the mean pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) MoM levels were significantly decreased in inverse relationship with homocysteine level among all 4 groups (F = 31.127, P <.001). If homocysteine is assayed as part of the first-trimester maternal serum testing, it is important to adjust for homocysteine concentration when using PAPP-A serum level for calculating the risk of fetal aneuploidy. © The Author(s) 2010.

79952104295	The associations between labor and delivery mode and maternal and placental oxidative stress	To study oxidative stress differences between women with normal vaginal deliveries (VD) and those with elective cesarean sections without labor (CS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, 8-isoprostane, nitrotyrosine and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in blood, urine, and placental samples were assessed. The VD group had significantly higher placental 8-isoprostane and 8-OHdG levels as well as greater plasma TAC and 8-OHdG levels and lower erythrocyte SOD activity in umbilical venous blood. Women with VD exhibited differential changes in maternal oxidative stress before and after delivery compared with women with CS. Furthermore, we found that repetitive hypoxia-reoxygenation increased the 8-isoprostane and 8-OHdG levels in villous explants compared with the normoxic controls. Together, these results indicate that labor is associated with increased placental oxidative stress and has an influence on maternal oxidative stress. Therefore, women with VD exhibit different oxidative stress indicators than do those with CS. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

79955970513	Prenatal diagnostic rates and postnatal outcomes of fetal orofacial clefts in a Taiwanese population	Objective: To report the incidence, prenatal diagnostic rate, and postnatal outcomes of fetal orofacial cleft at a tertiary referral center in Taiwan. Methods: The demographic data, maternal and fetal characteristics, and postnatal outcomes for fetuses with cleft lip and/or cleft palate (CL/P) born between January 1998 and December 2008 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, were reviewed retrospectively, and diagnostic rates were evaluated according to cleft type. Results: Among 26 499 deliveries, 84 were affected with CL/P. The mean maternal age and gestational age at detection of CL/P were 30.37 years (range 21-41 years) and 24.7 weeks (range 18-33 weeks), respectively. Thirty-one fetuses had associated structural anomalies, 5 of which involved chromosomal aberrations. CL/P was diagnosed prenatally for 74 (88%) fetuses. After consultations, 17 pregnancies (20%) were aborted. The postnatal survival rate was 95.5% (64/67 infants). The type of cleft had a significant influence on correct prenatal diagnosis (P < 0.001). Conclusion: For fetuses diagnosed prenatally with an orofacial cleft, access to an experienced craniofacial team, well-planned delivery, and pediatric intensive care led to favorable postnatal outcomes after lethal malformations were excluded through detailed sonographic and chromosomal evaluations. © 2011 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

0036323384	Characteristics of women seeking treatment for premenstrual syndrome in Taiwan	Objective: To analyze the characteristics of 150 women who visited a premenstrual syndrome (PMS) clinic in a Taiwanese medical center staffed by both psychiatrists and gynecologists. Method: All subjects were interviewed and assessed for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) using DSM-IV criteria, a PMS questionnaire, and the structured Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Where PMDD was suspected, subjects were followed using a daily symptom record. Results: A total of 110 subjects (73%) met the ICD-10 criteria for PMS. The most common PMS symptoms were minor psychological discomfort, muscular tension, and aches or pains. For 129 subjects (86%), other concurrent psychiatric disorders were diagnosed using the MINI. Of these, 48 (37%) reported premenstrual exacerbation (PME) of a previously diagnosed psychiatric condition. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that women who complain of PMS may be at a high risk of other psychiatric dysfunction, especially mood disorder. Further, the high proportion of PME cases determined in this study suggests that further investigation is required.

0036342736	Characteristics of women using a mental health clinic in a gynecologic out-patient setting	A special mental health clinic was set up in the gynecologic out-patient setting of a medical center. The present study examined the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients seen at the clinic and evaluated the need for mental health services in a gynecologic setting. Participants were 136 consecutive patients who visited the clinic during a 6 month period. Their ages ranged from 20 to 74 years, with a mean age of 41.5±12.3 years. Twenty-three percent of women were referred by gynecologists. All subjects were interviewed by experienced psychiatrists using the structured Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), supplemented by the DSM-IV criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and other diagnoses. The most common diagnosis was major depressive disorder (36.0%), followed by generalized anxiety disorder (29.4%), PMDD (16.2%), dysthymic disorder (14.7%) and others. Patients were categorized into four major diagnostic categories: depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, PMDD and others. No significant differences were found in years of education, employment status, living situations or referral pattern among the four major diagnostic groups. Most patients with anxiety disorders were married. Our results suggest that the gynecologic department may be a good setting to help women with mental disorders.

81755161296	Elevated serum cholesterol levels in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder	Objectives: To study the association of premenstrual serum total cholesterol level (TC) with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Method: The premenstrual serum cholesterol levels of 34 patients with PMDD and 20 normal controls were measured, and the rates of hypercholesterolemia in the 2 groups were compared. Results: The mean of the premenstrual cholesterol level of the study group was 180.82 ± 34.47 mg/dL, while that of the control group was 162.45 ± 21.29 mg/dL (t = 2.152, df = 52, p = 0.036). The prevalence of premenstrual hypercholesterolemia (serum total cholesterol > 200 mg/dL) was 23.53% (8/34) in the PMDD group and zero in the normal control group (chi-square = 5.524, df = 1, p = 0.019). Conclusion: The results showed elevated premenstrual serum cholesterol in PMDD and implied a new direction of research to further explore the etiology of PMDD. It is suggested that the pathophysiology of premenstrual dysphoric disorder may be similar to that of anxiety disorders. © 2011, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.

84860805013	Adnexal torsion in a woman undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation with clomiphene citrate therapy: A case report and review of the literature	Ovarian stimulation is a unique aid for patients treated for anovulation and an important tool in various assisted reproduction treatments. Clomiphene citrate, an orally active, non-steroidal triphenylethylene derivate, is a commonly prescribed agent for ovulation induction. Clomiphene citrate is considered a safe agent and has rarely been associated with Significant side effects. This report describes a case of unilateral adnexal torsion after ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate; we performed unwinding of the adnexum, which appeared ischemic via laparoscopy. Unfortunately, the affected adnexum became hemorrhagic after this approach, which invariably led to its resection. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

84860478935	The association between maternal oxidative stress at mid-gestation and subsequent pregnancy complications	Objective: To investigate the association between maternal oxidative stress at mid-gestation and subsequent development of pregnancy complications. Study design: A total of 503 healthy pregnant women provided their blood and urine samples at 24 to 26 weeks of gestation and were prospectively followed through postpartum. These samples were used to assess a variety of oxidative stress markers, including plasma total antioxidant capacity, 8-isoprostane, erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activity, and urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Results: Compared with women with uncomplicated pregnancies, significantly higher plasma 8-isoprostane levels were noted in women who developed preeclampsia (P =.008) and small-for-gestational age infants (P =.002), while higher urinary 8-OHdG concentrations were noted in women who subsequently had low-birth-weight neonates (<2500 g, P =.043). Conclusion: Increased maternal oxidative stress at mid-gestation was associated with subsequent pregnancy complications. © The Author(s) 2012.

84862802551	Myeloperoxidase in the plasma and placenta of normal pregnant women and women with pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction	Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme protein produced and released by activated neutrophils and monocytes, and increased MPO is considered important in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Accumulating evidence suggests that preeclampsia (PE), idiopathic intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and CVD share many similar metabolic disturbances, including an enhanced systemic inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesized that MPO plays an important role in the development of PE and IUGR. Plasma samples were collected mid-gestation and at delivery from women with normal pregnancies (n = 40) and those who subsequently developed PE (n = 20), IUGR (n = 11) or both (PE + IUGR, n = 8). Placental samples were obtained immediately after delivery from 22 women with normal pregnancies, 19 women with PE, 14 women with IUGR, and 14 women with PE + IUGR. The MPO concentrations were measured using ELISA. Women with PE + IUGR had significantly higher plasma MPO before delivery than normal pregnant women. There was no difference in plasma levels at mid-gestation or the placental concentrations between women with normal pregnancies and those who developed PE, IUGR, or PE + IUGR. Using explants prepared from the placentas of 8 women with normal pregnancies and 8 women with PE, we found no difference in the levels of MPO in the tissue homogenates and culture media between these two groups of women. Together, these results indicate that increased maternal circulating MPO in women with PE + IUGR is likely a result of enhanced systemic inflammation caused by the established disease rather than a primary pathophysiological factor. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863862107	Factors associated with the intention to recommend pertussis vaccination for postpartum women: A survey in Taiwan of obstetrician-gynecologists' knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes	Objective: To examine obstetrician-gynecologists' knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes associated with the intention to recommend adult tetanus, reduced diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination to postpartum women. Materials and Methods: A survey instrument was mailed to a total of 2686 members of the Taiwan Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology to assess provider demographic characteristics, occupational information, pertussis knowledge, and beliefs and attitudes about vaccination. The intention to recommend pertussis vaccination to postpartum women was evaluated. Trend chi-square statistics and multivariate logistic models were used to determine variables that were significantly associated with intention to recommend vaccination. Results: Of the 676 surveys returned (25.2%), 510 participants were active in obstetric practice. A statistically significant difference was found in mean ± SD knowledge scores for pertussis disease and pertussis vaccination between obstetrician-gynecologists who intended to recommend and those who did not intend to recommend postpartum Tdap vaccination (disease: 2.99 ± 2.2 vs. 2.31 ± 1.9, respectively, p < .001; vaccination: 2.64 ± 2.2 vs. 1.36 ± 1.8, respectively, p < .001). Obstetrician-gynecologists who were in favor of postpartum Tdap vaccination were more likely to: (1) rate the change in pertussis incidence among adults as increased; (2) rate pertussis disease among newborn infants as highly severe; (3) rate pertussis as highly contagious; and (4) understand the current recommendation of important organizations for protecting infants against pertussis. Conclusion: Our study of obstetrician-gynecologists' attitudes and intentions concerning postpartum Tdap vaccination may be useful in guiding the design of effective perinatal Tdap immunization programs nationwide. © 2012 .

84864018991	Increased autophagy in placentas of intrauterine growth-restricted pregnancies	Background: Unexplained intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) may be a consequence of placental insufficiency; however, its etiology is not fully understood. We surmised that defective placentation in IUGR dysregulates cellular bioenergic homeostasis, leading to increased autophagy in the villous trophoblast. The aims of this work were (1) to compare the differences in autophagy, p53 expression, and apoptosis between placentas of women with normal or IUGR pregnancies; (2) to study the effects of hypoxia and the role of p53 in regulating trophoblast autophagy; and (3) to investigate the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis in hypoxic trophoblasts. Methodology/Principal Findings: Compared with normal pregnant women, women with IUGR had higher placental levels of autophagy-related proteins LC3B-II, beclin-1, and damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM), with increased p53 and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 (M30). Furthermore, cytotrophoblasts cultured under hypoxia (2% oxygen) in the presence or absence of nutlin-3 (a p53 activity stimulator) had higher levels of LC3B-II, DRAM, and M30 proteins and increased Bax mRNA expression compared with controls cultured under standard conditions. In contrast, administration of pifithrin-α (a p53 activity inhibitor) during hypoxia resulted in protein levels that were similar to those of the control groups. Moreover, cytotrophoblasts transfected with LC3B, beclin-1, or DRAM siRNA had higher levels of M30 compared with the controls under hypoxia. However, transfection with Bcl-2 or Bax siRNA did not cause any significant change in the levels of LC3B-II in hypoxic cytotrophoblasts. Conclusions/Significance: Together, these results suggest that there is a crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis in IUGR and that p53 plays a pivotal and complex role in regulating trophoblast cell turnover in response to hypoxic stress. © 2012 Hung et al.

0037235222	Preliminary normal reference values of nuchal translucency thickness in Taiwanese fetuses at 11-14 weeks of gestation	Background: To investigate normal reference values of nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in normal Taiwanese fetuses between 11 and 14 weeks of gestation. Methods: A prospective study of ultrasound measurements of fetal NT and crownrump length (CRL) at 11-14 weeks of gestation was conducted in 724 consecutive Taiwanese fetuses between 1998 and 2001. The relationship between NT and 5-mm intervals of the CRL of the fetus was analyzed. NT thickness was converted into multiple of median (MoM) values for the proper CRL. The estimated risk of trisomy 21 was calculated in combination with maternal age and NT MoM. Results: NT thickness increased with increasing CRL and gestational week in the first trimester. The mean (median) of NT thickness at 11-14 weeks was 1.56 (1.50) mm. Values of NT logMoM showed a normal Gaussian distribution with a mean of -0.0062 and standard deviation of 0.1146. The overall frequency of NT thickness of ≥ 2.5 mm and ≥ 3.0 mm was 1.7% (12/724) and 0.7% (5/724), respectively. There were 18 (2.5%) of 724 normal fetuses with the eseimated risk of trisomy 21, based on maternal age and NT thickness higher than 1:300. Conclusions: Because of weekly variations and racial differences in NT measurements, normal reference values should be established to convert NT thickness into MoM values for calculating the estimated risk of trisomy 21 in first-trimester NT screening.

0037275809	Elevated second-trimester maternal serum inhibin A levels in Asian pregnancies with fetal Down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities	Subjects: To evaluate second-trimester maternal serum inhibin A levels in Asian pregnancies with fetal Down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities. Methods: Inhibin A level was measured from the serum samples of 25 chromosomally abnormal pregnancies, including 15 cases of Down syndrome, 4 cases of trisomy 18, 1 case of trisomy 13, and 5 cases of sex chromosome aneuploidies (4 cases of 47,XXY and 1 case of 45,X) and in a cohort of 150 controls during the second trimester of pregnancy. Results: The multiple of median levels of Down syndrome (1.74) and other chromosomally abnormal pregnancies (2.03) are significantly higher than that of normal pregnancies (p = 0.002 and p = 0.024, respectively). Only 3 of 15 (20%) Down syndrome cases had inhibin A levels at or above the 95th centile of the control values. Conclusions: Inhibin A levels are raised in Asian women affected with fetal Down syndrome and sex chromosome abnormality. In spite of the poor discrepancy of inhibin A, it might be a potential marker for Down syndrome screening in Asians. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

84866740032	Twenty-one years of experience with ovarian ectopic pregnancy at one institution in Taiwan	Objective: To review the experience with patients with ovarian ectopic pregnancy (OEP) at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Lin-Kou Medical Center, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan, between 1989 and 2009. Methods: A retrospective review of the presentation, prevalence, diagnosis, and trends in treatment of patients with OEP, and the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures and intrauterine devices (IUD). The incidence rate ratios (IRR) of ectopic pregnancies (EPs) per live births, OEPs per EPs, and OEPs per live births were analyzed. Results: The 110 OEPs diagnosed comprised 2.0% of all EPs (n = 5408) and 1:1543 of all live births, leading to a mean OEP per year of 5.24. Seventy-eight patients were managed with laparoscopy and 32 underwent laparotomy. Twenty-six (23.6%) patients used an IUD and 12 (10.9%) had undergone ART. OEP associated with ART increased in the last 10 years of the study period. The IRR of EPs per live births, OEPs per EPs, and OEPs per live births all increased between 1989 and 2009. Management of OEP tended to favor laparoscopy in the later years. Conclusion: There was a trend toward better management of OEP with laparoscopy. ART has become a risk factor for OEP. The IRR of EPs per live births, OEPs per EPs, and OEPs per live births all increased over the 21-year period. © 2012 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

84880921408	Risk factors and perinatal outcomes associated with idiopathic small for gestational age Taiwanese newborns	Objective To determine risk factors and perinatal outcomes associated with small for gestational age (SGA) neonates among healthy pregnant women. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 49 945 women who gave birth at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Idiopathic SGA newborns (n = 3398) were characterized by a birth weight below the 10th percentile for mean weight corrected for GA and fetal sex. Results Risk factors for idiopathic SGA newborns included hypercoiling of the umbilical cord (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-7.0); prior fetal death (aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.0-3.9); primiparity (aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4-1.7); adolescent pregnancy (aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0), low prepregnancy weight (aOR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5-1.8), low prepregnancy body mass index (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3); short stature (aOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.4); and entangled umbilical cord (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3). Idiopathic SGA newborns correlated with increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, including fetal death, low Apgar scores, oligohydramnios, placental abruption, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Conclusion Some risk factors for idiopathic SGA newborns were modifiable, suggesting potential implications for public health. © 2013 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

84883751705	Ultrasound-Guided Aspiration and Ethanol Sclerotherapy (EST) for Treatment of Cyst Recurrence in Patients after Previous Endometriosis Surgery: Analysis of Influencing Factors Using a Decision Tree	Study Objective: To evaluate the efficiency of transvaginal aspiration accompanied by ethanol sclerotherapy for treating cyst recurrence in patients who have previously undergone surgery to treat endometriosis and to analyze various factors that influence success rates using a data mining system. Design: Retrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II-3). Setting: Teaching hospital affiliated with Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan. Patients: One hundred ninety-six patients with endometrioma recurrence. Intervention: A total of 274 transvaginal aspirations followed by sclerotherapy with 95% ethanol. Treatment times varied from immediate removal (0-10 minutes) to in situ retention. Patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months to detect complications, determine the size and persistence of cysts, obtain the pelvic pain score, and assess for pregnancy or the need for repeat surgical intervention. A decision tree was used to determine factors from the collected data that most influenced the success of treatment. Measurements and Main Results: Cyst size was consistently reduced until 6 months after ethanol sclerotherapy. The mean (SD) cyst reduction rate was 37.2% (42.2%), and the pain score reduction rate was 20.5% (71.5%). The antral follicle count was simultaneously increased by 36.4%. Sixty-three patients (23%) required repeated surgery during the observation period and were treated with either repeat aspiration (13.5%) or major laparoscopic or open laparotomic interventions (8.4%). Eighteen of 101 infertile patients (17.8%) achieved pregnancy. The total recovery rate (pregnancy or no persistence of symptoms or cyst) was significantly higher in patients in the groups that received longer treatment (7-10 minutes and retention) than in the groups with shorter treatment (0-6 minute) (47.0% vs 28.7%; p <.005). The highest recovery rate was observed in patients with longer treatment time, smaller cysts (≤5.05 cm), lower CA 125 level (≤62.03 IU/mL), and fewer cysts (≤3 cm) (35 of 49 [71.4%]). In patients with larger cysts and cysts with clear contents, better success can be achieved with longer treatment. The use of postoperative ovarian suppression, traditional Chinese medicine, or no therapy for 6 months before the study was not significant among groups. Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy with 95% ethanol retention is an effective alternative therapy for recurrent ovarian endometrioma, in particular in selected patient groups. © 2013 AAGL.

84884593686	Perinatal outcome in normal pregnant women with incidental thrombocytopenia at delivery	Objective: To investigate the perinatal outcomes of women who suffered from thrombocytopenia at delivery but did not have other diseases during pregnancy. Materials and Methods: We considered all singleton deliveries after 24 weeks of gestation at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan between 2001 and 2010. Women were excluded from this study if they suffered from any of the following conditions: chronic hypertension, hepatitis, acute fatty liver, liver cirrhosis, nephropathy, overt diabetes mellitus, connective tissue disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, or immune thrombocytopenia. Pregnancies complicated by gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or fetal anomalies during gestation were also excluded. A total of 18,384 deliveries were included for analysis. Women were divided into three groups according to platelet count at admission. Results: A total of 787 pregnancies (4.3%) were complicated by thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenic women had a significantly higher rate of cesarean delivery compared to women who did not have this condition. No other differences were observed among these three groups regarding the rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions: The results indicate that women who suffered from incidental thrombocytopenia at delivery but did not have other diseases during pregnancy were not at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. © 2013.

0242596472	Ovarian Endometrioma Associated with Very High Serum CA-125 Levels	CA-125 is a 220-kD cell surface glycoprotein present in over 80% of non-mucinous epithelial ovarian carcinomas and it occurs in the serum of healthy males and females at low concentrations (< 35 U/mL). Serum CA-125 concentration may also be moderately elevated in several benign conditions, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine fibroids, pregnancy, spontaneous abortion with chromosomal abnormality, and especially in endometriosis. However, serum CA-125 concentration is seldom > 100 IU/ml in endometriosis. In this paper, we present a patient with unilateral ovarian endometrioma associated with abnormally high serum CA-125 level (> 6000 U/mL) and after excision of the ovarian tumor, the CA-125 levels returned to normal. Our case further emphasizes the association of high levels of CA-125 with benign gynecologic conditions and we discussed the possible explanations for this abnormal elevation of CA-125 levels.

84892521709	Autophagy in the human placenta throughout gestation	Background: Autophagy has been reported to be essential for pre-implantation development and embryo survival. However, its role in placental development and regulation of autophagy during pregnancy remain unclear. The aims of this study were to (1) study autophagy by characterizing changes in levels of beclin-1, DRAM, and LC3B in human placenta throughout gestation; (2) determine whether autophagy is involved in regulation of trophoblast invasion in JEG-3 cells (a choriocarcinoma cell line); (3) examine the effects of reduced oxygen and glucose on the autophagic changes; and (4) investigate the effect of reoxygenation and supplementation of glucose after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) on the autophagic changes in primary cytotrophoblasts obtained from normal term pregnancy. Methodology/Principal Findings: An analysis of 40 placental samples representing different gestational stages showed (1) no significant differences in beclin-1, DRAM, and LC3B-II levels in placentas between early and mid-gestation, and late gestation with vaginal delivery; (2) placentas from late gestation with cesarean section had lower levels of LC3B-II compared to early and mid-gestation, and late gestation with vaginal delivery; levels of DRAM were also lower compared to placentas from early and mid-gestation; and (3) using explant cultures, villous tissues from early and late gestation had similar rates of autophagic flux under physiological oxygen concentrations. Knockdown of BECN1, DRAM, and LC3B had no effects on viability and invasion activity of JEG-3 cells. On the other hand, OGD caused a significant increase in the levels of LC3B-II in primary cytotrophoblasts, while re-supplementation of oxygen and glucose reduced these changes. Furthermore, there were differential changes in levels of beclin-1, DRAM, and LC3B-II in response to changes in oxygen and glucose levels. Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate that autophagy is involved in development of the human placenta and that changes in oxygen and glucose levels participate in regulation of autophagic changes in cytotrophoblast cells. © 2013 Hung et al.

84904006734	A retrospective study on the course and outcome of fetal ventriculomegaly	ObjectiveTo evaluate the outcomes associated with fetal ventriculomegaly. Materials and methodsReports of women who underwent ultrasound scanning between 18 and 36 weeks of gestation during the period from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2010, were reviewed. According to the defined severity of ventriculomegaly of affected fetuses, the women were divided into the following groups: (1) mild ventriculomegaly (Group A); (2) moderate ventriculomegaly (Group B); and (3) severe ventriculomegaly (Group C). The women were classified into the "gray zone" group if the fetal lateral ventricle measured between 7mm and <10mm. All cases were followed up with additional ultrasound scans. Postnatal information was obtained from the computer database or the medical charts. ResultsA total of 41 cases were recruited for this analysis. Four (9.8%) cases had an abnormal karyotype. Twelve women (29.3%) opted for termination of pregnancy. Of the 29 women who delivered, 56.1% (N=23) were from Group A, 14.6% (N=6) were from Group B, and none was from Group C. All children in Group A had normal neurological development. Three children in Group B had normal neurological development, whereas the other three had neurologic deficits. A total of 432 cases were classified into the "gray zone" group. Of these cases, 2.8% (N=12) progressed to ventriculomegaly. ConclusionCases of isolated and mild ventriculomegaly without additional structural anomalies or chromosomal aberrations had good prognoses. However, the parents of fetuses with moderate or severe ventriculomegaly should be counseled regarding related risks. If the ventricular size of the fetus falls within the "gray zone", at least one additional exam in the third trimester should be performed, for early detection of ventriculomegaly and other related abnormalities. It is important to make the parents of these fetuses aware of these risks, from a medico-legal point of view. © 2014.

10844248050	The influence of image magnification in first-trimester screening for Down syndrome by fetal nuchal translucency in Asians	Objective: The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the impact of image magnification in the measurements of crown-rump length (CRL) and nuchal translucency (NT) thickness for first-trimester Down syndrome screening in Asians. Methods: Ultrasound measurements of NT and CRL were performed in 561 consecutive Taiwanese unaffected fetuses and 11 cases of Down syndrome fetuses between 12 and 14 weeks of gestation. All sonographic images were measured by one qualified examiner to prospectively undergo first-trimester NT screening for Down syndrome. Fetal CRL and NT thickness were measured on three separated images including the original image, regular image, and the magnified image. Results: A significant mean difference (0.59 ± 4.24 mm) of CRL was found between measurements on the original and regular image (p < 0.001). There was a significant mean difference of NT thickness measurements between the regular and magnified image (0.12 ± 0.25 mm, p < 0.001). Seven out of the 11 cases (63.6%) of Down syndrome with NT thickness ≥2.5 mm was measured on three separated images. A significantly reduced incidence of NT thickness ≥2.5 mm on the magnified image was noted than those of the original and regular image measurements in unaffected cases (p < 0.001). Either using the assessing method by the 95th centile cutoff value of NT thickness or combined risk, our results could achieve observed detection rate of 63.6% measured on three separated images. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the image magnification could reduce the false-positive rate by using a fixed cutoff value of NT thickness, but would have no influence on the results when using the assessing method either by the 95th centile cutoff value of NT thickness or the combined risk. In order to place the caliper more accurately, a magnified image should be recommended as a standard image in the measurements of the NT thickness. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
