14844366712	Microparticle formation of ethyl-cellulose with gas antisolvent process	The gas antisolvent (GAS) process makes use of the ability of gases to dissolve in organic liquids and to lower the solvent power of the liquid for the solutes in solution, thus causing the solids to precipitate. Ethyl-cellulose (EC) is the ramification of cellulose. It is the first time to use the gas antisolvent process to produce EC microparticles, which would be mainly used as a hydrophobic coating material or matrix former for modifying the release of drugs from oral dosage forms. In the experimental conditions, different size particles of EC, with mean diameters ranging from 2 μm to 15 μm, were obtained. Several parameters, such as pressure, temperature and different organic solvents, were investigated. The results showed that the mean particle size increased as the temperature of the particle formation vessel increased; while the particle size and its distribution decreased as the pressure of the particle formation vessel increased. The acetone solution of EC could make smaller particles than the ethanol solution. This work is the first step to make sustained releasing, target, adhesive and drug containing EC micropariticles.

Some soil water movement conditions under subsurface drip irrigation with point-source emitter were calculated and compared. Results of simulation were verified by the measurement of soil moisture content, water front, cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate in laboratory test. The results showed that the simulation results agreed well with measurement values. The relative error between simulated and measured values is less 10% and so the predictability of the model is acceptable.

1842709150	Application of artificial neural network based on the genetic algorithm in predicting the root distribution of winter wheat	In this study, a controlled experiment of winter wheat under water stress at the seedling stage was conducted in soil columns in greenhouse. Based on the data gotten from the experiment, a model to estimate root length density distribution was developed through optimizing the weights of neural network by genetic algorithm. The neural network model was constructed by using forward neural network framework, by applying the strategy of the roulette wheel selection and reserving the most optimizing series of weights, which were composed by real codes. This model was applied to predict the root length density distribution of winter wheat, and the predicted root length density had good agreement with experiment data. The way could save a lot of manpower and material resources for determining the root length density distribution of winter wheat.

This method was verified with the water and salt balance and numerical experiments. The results were compared with the calculated results done by HYDRUS software (Galerkin Finite Element Method). From the results of numerical calculation and the validation of water and salt balance, this method is of high-accuracy. It is obvious that the amount of calculation can be decreased and the calculation procedure can be simplified by GDM. Especially the upwind scheme can effectively avoid the numerical dispersion and oscillation even under the condition of dramatic changes of salt contents and without dense nodes.

The transfer function model (TFM) developed by Jury et al (1982) was used for simulating chloride travel through the soil columns during steady, saturated water. The transport parameter values for the soils were determined by TFM (with an assumed lognormal distribution of travel times). The simulations were tested against experimental values of drainage effluent concentration. In addition, the characteristic values of convective transport of chloride in soils were analyzed.

24044526225	Simulation of the effects of groundwater level on vegetation change by combining FEFLOW software	The numerical models for predicting two-dimensional groundwater flow in the continental river watersheds were developed based on the water budget in the watershed, and by regarding the effects of groundwater depth on vegetation change as the source/sink factors. The vegetation changes patterns were classified into several types according to climatic conditions and groundwater depths in the desert regions. The source/sink factors such as volumes of irrigation water and pumped groundwater were found to have the greatest effects on groundwater flow. The variations of source/sink volumes were calculated in detail according to the irrigation systems for different crops. The other source/sink volumes associated with vegetation changes due to the vegetation type changes are of secondary importance, and they include mainly permeation and evapotranspiration of the limited precipitation and condensed water, and their volumes are distributed in the certain periods. The spatial data of the regional vegetation change were processed using GIS, and the effects of groundwater level on the vegetation change were simulated by combining the vegetation type changes with FEFLOW software. The results indicated that the groundwater level maintained a decreasing trend in the upper part of the marginal zone of fans and a continuously increasing trend in the alluvial-diluvial plains. This combined effect resulted in deterioration of vegetation on the upper part of the watersheds and a further soil salinization in the lower alluvial-diluvial plains. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

25844515539	Modeling desertification change in Minqin County, China	Monitoring environmental processes is becoming increasingly important wherever there is increasing population and economic development pressure placed on fragile environments. Remote sensing, digital image processing, and spatial analysis have proven to be useful technologies in both assessing and monitoring environmental change. In this study, they were used to assess desertification processes and change in Minqin County, China from 1988 to 1997. The results suggest that wind erosion was the dominant cause of desertification in more than half of the study area. Coupled with this were increases in salinization processes, affecting 33.62% of the land area in 1997. Overall, moderate desertification was found to be the dominant desertification grade (43.64% of total area), followed by extreme/severe desertification (26.15% of total area) in 1997. In addition, examination of landscape pattern changes indicated that desertification processes at the landscape level were becoming evident at increasing levels of fragmentation, complexity in shape, and isolation of patches. Major fluctuations in desertification type and grade were found at the fringes of oases, where an ongoing shift was taking place between cultivation, abandonment, and reclamation. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.

The capacity of the combustor is 25kW with the features of flapper valves and frequency range from 60 to 115Hz. The pulse pressures inside the combustion chamber were measured and a phenomenon of frequency jump of the pulse combustor was discovered. The emission amount of CO, NOx of the pulse combustor were measured and analyzed. Experimental results show that the oscillating combustion characteristics of pulse combustor can lead to a low emission of NOx CO. Through experiments and theoretical analysis the heart transfer coefficients of oscillating flow produced by pulse combustor and nonoscillating flow were obtained. It indicates that the heat transfer coefficient of oscillating flow is about 2.5 to 3.2 times greater than that of nonoscillating flow.

Thereafter, soil water and solute transport with root-water-uptake in a soil-wheat system was simulated numerically, in which the estimated RLD distributions were incorporated. The results showed that the estimated RLD distributions of winter wheat using the neural network model combined with the improved genetic algorithm, as well as the simulated soil water content and salinity distributions, were comparably in agreement with the experimental data.

33745510445	The Response of Winter Wheat Root to the Period and the After-Effect of Soil Water Stress	To reveal the period and after-effect of soil water stress on winter wheat, the article employs the experiment results carried out in the greenhouse. The results showed that the root-restricted weights varied with stress degrees and stress times during and after water stressing. In the course of stress, the chief reason resticting the weight of root was the stress intensity at this time, and that of severe stress treatment was larger than that of mild stress treatment. After water stress was relieved, the results of the after-effect of soil water stress on root growth were that, the stress intensity of short-time and mild stress was larger than that of long-time and severe stress. Comparing two-stage stress intensities, root-restricted weight resulted from after-effect intensity of stress under all of the short-time treatment, and the mild and the long-time stress treatments, while that resulted from the period stress intensity under the severe and the long-time stress treatments. In general, the effects of water stress on root were attributed to the three factors, a formed basis in the previous stage, the after-effect of water condition before this stage and influence of water in this stage, which lead to the characters of root in the whole growth stage. © 2006 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

33746219538	Simulation and analysis of soil water and nitrogen behaviors in Huang-Huai-Hai Plain in summer-maize growing season	The Huang-Huai-Hai Plain(HHHP) was selected as the research region of this paper. A geographic information system based conjunctive simulation model incorporating soil water, heat, nitrogen behaviors and crop growth was established and validated. The regional distributions of water and nitrogen use efficiency (WUE and NUE), and nitrogen loss were studied under the soil, meteorological and rural socio-economical condition of HHHP in 1999 by the GIS-based model. The results show that, due to the variations in biophysical conditions and farming practices, the inter-physiognomy variations on WUE, NUE as well as soil nitrogen leaching has exhibited significant differences. The multivariate stepwise regression results show that in summer-maize growing season, nitrogen leaching was significantly positively correlated with nitrogen fertilizer applied (NFA), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), Active accumulated temperature (ACT), rainfall and irrigation amount (RIA). WUE was significantly positively correlated with NFA and significantly negatively correlated with ACT. NUE was significantly positively correlated with RIA and significantly negatively relative with NFA and soil organic matter (SOM).

33745868003	Evaluating a three dimensional model of diffuse photosynthetically active radiation in maize canopies	Diffuse photosynthetically active radiation (DPAR) is important during overcast days and for plant parts shaded from the direct beam radiation. Simulation of DPAR interception by individual plant parts of a canopy, separately from direct beam photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), may give important insights into plant ecology. This paper presents a model to simulate the interception of DPAR in plant canopies. A sub-model of a virtual maize canopy was reconstructed. Plant surfaces were represented as small triangular facets positioned according to three-dimensionally (3D) digitized data collected in the field. Then a second sub-model to simulate the 3D DPAR distribution in the canopy was developed by dividing the sky hemisphere into a grid of fine cells that allowed for the anisotropic distribution of DPAR over the sky hemisphere. This model, DSHP (Dividing Sky Hemisphere with Projecting), simulates which DSH (Divided Sky Hemisphere) cells are directly visible from a facet in the virtual canopy, i.e. not obscured by other facets. The DPAR reaching the center of a facet was calculated by summing the amounts of DPAR present in every DSH cell. The distribution of DPAR in a canopy was obtained from the calculated DPARs intercepted by all facets in the canopy. This DSHP model was validated against DPAR measurements made in an actual maize (Zea mays L.) canopy over selected days during the early filling stage. The simulated and measured DPAR at different canopy depths showed a good agreement with a R

33751545806	Spatial Patterns of Soil Heavy Metals in Urban-Rural Transition Zone of Beijing	To identify the main sources responsible for soil heavy metal contamination, 70 topsoils were sampled from the Daxing County in the urban-rural transition zone of Beijing. The concentrations of heavy metals Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Cd, Ni, As, Se, Hg, and Co; the soil texture; and the organic matter content were determined for each soil sample. Descriptive statistics and geostatistics were used to analyze the data, and Kriging analysis was used to estimate the unobserved points and to map the spatial patterns of soil heavy metals. The results showed that the concentrations of all the soil heavy metals exceeded their background levels with the exception of As and Se. However, only the Cd concentration in some areas exceeded the critical value of the national soil quality standard. The semivariance analysis showed that the spatial correlation distances for soil Cu, Zn, Cr, Cd, As, Ni, and Co ranged from 4.0 to 7.0 km, but soil Se, Pb, and Hg had a larger correlation distance. Soil Co, Se, Cd, Cu and Zn showed a strong spatial correlation, whereas the other soil heavy metals showed medium spatial correlation. Soil heavy metal concentrations were related to soil texture, organic matter content, and the accumulation of heavy metals in the soils, which was because of air deposition and use of water from the Liangshui, Xinfeng, and Fenghe rivers that are contaminated by wastewater and sewage for the purpose of irrigation of fields. Hence, a comprehensive treatment plan for these rivers should be formulated. © 2006 Soil Science Society of China.

The water drainage in 2 m soil profile is calculated by the HYDRUS-1D model from October 1998 to September 2001. When the fixed ground water table is selected as the lower boundary condition, the soil water content at different depth in 2m soil profile is calculated by the HYDRUS-1D model, which agrees well with the measured values, however, when taking free drainage and pressure head as the lower boundary condition, the difference exists between the measured and the simulated values. In comparison with the result of dynamic water drainage and accumulated water drainage estimated by using the Darcy law, we found that their dynamic process of water drainage by using the fixed ground water table agreed well with that of the Darcy Law. Therefore, the fixed ground water table being selected as the lower boundary condition is suitable for the local conditions.

Results show that there are negatively significant correlation between the slopes of terrain and SOM content in 1980, as a result of soil erosion and land use pattern changes. The slopes of terrain do not have obvious impact on the spatial distribution of SOM content in 1999 under long-term sugarcane monoculture. There are significant correlations among the elevation, latitude, longitude and SOM contents due to the stress direction when applying organic manures. The spatio-temporal changes of SOM content are related to the degree of intensive cultivation. The SOM content of the higher yield fields with high degree of intensive cultivation decreases 11% on average, while the SOM content of lower yield fields increases 50% on average under low degree of intensive cultivation. Lots of sugarcane-derived organic matter has already caused soil nutrition imbalance.

A uniform data structure, ARC GRID ASCII format, was used both in GIS and WNMM for achieving a close Model-GIS coupling. A significant part of WNMM adopts and modifies concepts and components from widely used models, with a focus on soil N transformations. WNMM simulates the key processes of water dynamics in the surface and subsurface of soils: including evapotranspiration, canopy interception, water movement and groundwater fluctuations; heat transfer and solute transport; crop growth; C and N cycling in the soil-crop system; and agricultural management practices (crop rotation, irrigation, fertiliser application, harvest and tillage). The model runs on a daily time step at any desired scale and is driven by lumped variables (meteorological and crop biological data) in text data format, and spatial variables (soil and agricultural management) in ARC GRID ASCII format. In particular, WNMM simulates all key N transformations in agricultural fields, including mineralisation of fresh crop residue N and soil organic N, formation of soil organic N, immobilisation in biomass, nitrification, ammonia (NH

34047235788	Parameter stability of the functional-structural plant model GREENLAB as affected by variation within populations, among seasons and among growth stages	• Background and Aims: It is increasingly accepted that crop models, if they are to simulate genotype-specific behaviour accurately, should simulate the morphogenetic process generating plant architecture. A functional-structural plant model, GREENLAB, was previously presented and validated for maize. The model is based on a recursive mathematical process, with parameters whose values cannot be measured directly and need to be optimized statistically. This study aims at evaluating the stability of GREENLAB parameters in response to three types of phenotype variability: (1) among individuals from a common population; (2) among populations subjected to different environments (seasons); and (3) among different development stages of the same plants. • Methods: Five field experiments were conducted in the course of 4 years on irrigated fields near Beijing, China. Detailed observations were conducted throughout the seasons on the dimensions and fresh biomass of all above-ground plant organs for each metamer. Growth stage-specific target files were assembled from the data for GREENLAB parameter optimization. Optimization was conducted for specific developmental stages or the entire growth cycle, for individual plants (replicates), and for different seasons. Parameter stability was evaluated by comparing their CV with that of phenotype observation for the different sources of variability. A reduced data set was developed for easier model parameterization using one season, and validated for the four other seasons. • Key Results and Conclusions: The analysis of parameter stability among plants sharing the same environment and among populations grown in different environments indicated that the model explains some of the inter-seasonal variability of phenotype (parameters varied less than the phenotype itself), but not inter-plant variability (parameter and phenotype variability were similar). Parameter variability among developmental stages was small, indicating that parameter values were largely development-stage independent. The authors suggest that the high level of parameter stability observed in GREENLAB can be used to conduct comparisons among genotypes and, ultimately, genetic analyses. © The Author 2006.

34248358179	A landscape connectivity index for assessing desertification: A case study of Minqin County, China	As a global and regional environmental problem, desertification assessment is an instrumental component in developing global/regional actions plans aimed at preventing and/or eradicating desertification issues. Using a landscape assessment approach allows for relatively quick assessments of desertification that can then be used in developing practicable application plans at the regional level in desertification prevention planning and decision-making. This study was conducted to determine whether a cost-distance connectivity index could both reveal evidence of, and act as an indicator for, desertification. Cost-distance, a simple GIS-calculated connectivity measure, was applied to a 1997 land use map to indicate desertification in Minqin County, China. The results showed that connectivity based on cost-distance follows basic landscape ecological principles including species-area relations and edge effects, and indicates desertification. Although grain size had a significant effect on the cost-distance index, especially at patch boundaries, log cost-distance closely corresponded with degree of desertification within grain size. Changing the extent of analysis had no significant effect on the cost-distance index and its relevance to degree of desertification. The Minqin County landscape had a high level of connectivity, although the area's grasslands, oasis irrigated cultivated lands, alkali-saline lands and forestlands played important roles in resisting desertification. Three areas require restoration of native vegetation or afforestion to cut the connectivity of desertified patches. The application of connectivity based on cost-distance provides a straightforward, easily visualized description of desertification. In addition, land use data is readily available in China, allowing for relatively easy and quick assessments of regional level desertification for planning and decision-making. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

Preliminary results indicate that there is a clear variation pattern in the electromagnetic induction measurements and it corresponds well, at different spatial resolutions, with the pixel values of the "Great Ear" rings revealed by the Landsat imagery. They seem negatively correlated. The correlation coefficient for the 50 km transect is -0.6154 and the 40 km transect is -0.6891. It is suggested that the occurrence of the "Great Ear" rings on Landsat imagery is an indication of spatial zonal changes in salt and water contents, particle size, and other factors on the surface of the dry salt lake beds of Lop Nur.

The growth season of winter wheat was divided into six stages, taking the total amounts of irrigation and nitrogen application as the decision variables, the biomass of winter wheat, water and nitrogen use efficiency (WUE) were selected as the optimal objectives, then a multiple-object dynamic programming decision model was developed based on the process model in soil-plant system. The decision model was employed to optimize the management scenarios of irrigation and nitrogen application for winter wheat. Through calculating the crop water and nitrogen stress index, the optimal time and amount of water and nitrogen management were obtained. The results indicated that the irrigation amount had a 25% reduction on the average compared with the control, and the WUE increased by 12% compared with the average of control treatment under the condition of water stress (PS2 level), while under the condition of water and nitrogen stress (PS3 level), the irrigation amount had a 12% reduction on the average compared with control, and water and nitrogen use efficiency had a 13% and 16% increase compared with controls, respectively.

An electrostatic droplet generator was employed to produce APA microcapsules containing encapsulated β-gal or BMP-2 gene-transfected bone marrow-derived MSCs. We found that X-gal staining was still positive 28 days after encapsulation. Encapsulated BMP-2 gene-transfected cells were capable of constitutive delivery of BMP-2 proteins for at least 30 days. The encapsulated BMP-2 gene-transfected MSCs or the encapsulated non-gene transfer MSCs (control group) were cocultured with the undifferentiated MSCs. The gene products from the encapsulated BMP-2 cells could induce the undifferentiated MSCs to become osteoblasts that had higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity than those in the control group (p < 0.05). The APA microcapsules could inhibit the permeation of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjuncted immunoglobulin G. Mixed lymphocyte reaction also indicates that the APA microcapsules could prevent the encapsulated BMP-2 gene-transfected MSCs from initiating the cellular immune response. These results demonstrated that the nonautologous BMP-2 gene-transfected stem cells are of potential utility for enhancement of bone repair and bone regeneration in vivo. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The simulation of nitrogen transport was realized by utilizing the modified convection-dispersion equation of the HYDRUS1D model. The improved version of PS 123 model was applied to simulate the growth process of crop, production of dry matter, allocation of dry matter and crop production of light and heat. The crop yield under water stress was obtained from the simulation of leaf area index and root water uptake. The crop yield under water and nitrogen stress was calculated based on the simulation of the nitrogen demand of crop, nitrogen supply of soil and nitrogen uptake of crop.

34648825781	Coupled simulation on crop growth and soil water-heat-nitrogen transport II. Model validation and application	The model coupling soil-plant system with water and solute transport (SPWS model) developed by the authors was used to simulate the water movement, nitrogen transport and crop growth process in the experimental fields located at the North China Plain. The experiments for maize included 4 treatments with different irrigation scheme and N application rates during summer growing season. The results showed that the simulated water content and nitrate concentration in soil profile as well as the leaf area index, dry matter weight, crop N uptake and grain yield were all in good agreement with the measured data. The results of water and nitrogen balance indicated that optimal management of irrigation and N fertilizer can remarkably reduce the seepage loss, nitrate leaching and gaseous loss, at the same time the crop yield will be raised.

35348852744	Kinetics of coupled primary- and secondary-minimum deposition of colloids under unfavorable chemical conditions	This study examines the deposition/release mechanisms involved in colloid retention under unfavorable conditions through theoretical analysis and laboratory column experiments. A Maxwell approach was utilized to estimate the coupled effects of primary- and secondary-minimum deposition. Theoretical analysis indicates that the secondary energy minimum plays a dominant role in colloid deposition even for nanosized particles (e.g., 20 nm) and primary-minimum deposition rarely happens for large colloids (e.g., 1000 nm) when diffusion is the dominant process. Polystyrene latex particles (30 and 1156 nm) and clean sand were used to conduct three-step column experiments at different solution ionic strengths, a constant pH of 10, and a flow rate of 0.0012 cm/s. Experimental results confirm that small colloids can also be deposited in secondary minima. Additional column experiments involving flow interruption further indicates that the colloids deposited in the secondary energy well can be spontaneously released to bulk solution when the secondary energy minimum is comparable to the average Brownian kinetic energy. Experimental collision efficiencies are in good agreement with Maxwell model predictions but different from the theoretical values calculated by the interfacial force boundary layer approximation. We propose a priori analytical approach to estimate collision efficiencies accounting for both primary- and secondary-minimum deposition and suggest that the reversibility of colloid (e.g., viruses and bacteria) deposition must be considered in transport models for accurate predictions of their travel time in the subsurface environments. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

36749045773	Analytical solution of the heat pulse method in a parallelepiped sample space	The heat pulse method enables estimation of the thermal diffusivity (k), volumetric heat capacity (C), and thermal conductivity of soils (λ) and soil water content. In this study, analytical solutions were derived by the method of Green's function for a finite pulse cylinder source in a parallelepiped sample of size a by b by c with two kinds of boundary conditions. One is the zero surface temperature (ZST) boundary condition, and the other is the adiabatic boundary condition (ABC). The proposed solutions may be useful for evaluating the errors of a dual-probe heat pulse (DPHP) system introduced by approximating the finite heater with an infinite line source (ILS) model. Applications of the solution are presented in the context of an air-dried virtual soil sample to demonstrate how different factors (boundary conditions, soil sample size, heater needle length and radius, probe spacing, heating duration, and strength) can affect the error in k and C caused by using an ILS model. For a given parallelepiped (or soil column), the larger the ratio of lengths of the heater probe and the sample, the smaller the boundary influence on the temperature rise at the mid-needle temperature sensing location, and the smaller the errors introduced by using the ILS approximation. For various heating strengths, it was found that the errors in both k and C were relatively constant when all other parameters were fixed. These errors increased monotonically and slowly, however, as heat duration increased. © Soil Science Society of America. All rights reserved.

35648999135	Properties of medium-density composite particleboard from creeping wild rye and HDPE plastic	Creeping Wild Rye (CWR), Leymus triticoides, is a salt-tolerant and perennial grass, which is planted in San Joaquin Valley, California in the USA to lower salt contents from drainage irrigation water to prevent water streams and soil from pollution and alkalization, respectively. In this study, CWR was used as raw materials to manufacture medium-density particleboard. The objective of this research was to characterize the qualities (mechanical properties and water resistance) of CWR particleboards bonded by high density polyethylene (HDPE) from recycled food carrying bags, polymeric methane diphenyl diisocyanate (PMDI) and/or rice bran adhesive (RBA). The evaluated properties of particleboard included tensile strength (TS), modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), and internal bond strength (IB). Water absorption and thickness swell were used to evaluate the water resistance properties of finished CWR particleboard. The effects of the amount of HDPE, PMDI and/or RBA on the qualities of finished particleboards were determined. The partial PMDI replacement with RBA did not compromise the mechanical quality, but yield lower water resistance. Adding HDPE, however, improved the overall qualities of particleboards. In order to optimize the properties of medium-density particleboard made from CWR and HDPE, an orthogonal experimental design was employed. Results showed that up to 30% PMDI can be replaced by adding 20% HDPE with size of 10×10mm to manufacture the particleboard with higher mechanical strength and the water resistance particleboards than without HDPE.

36349024442	Efficient model for computing the distribution of direct solar radiation in maize canopy at organ level	An efficient model for computing the distribution of direct solar radiation in a maize canopy was developed. A virtual camera and a virtual canopy were used to complete the simulation at organ level, in which plant organ types were labeled by different colors. The virtual camera was used to take pictures of the virtual canopy from solar incident direction, with orthographic projection. The images were then used to compute the light distribution among individual plant organs by counting pixel numbers of each color type. The validities of the simulation results were evaluated from two aspects : simulation accuracy and computing time. The results showed that the simulation results agreed satisfactorily with those produced by a projection Z-buffer model (PZB) which had been validated by field experiments, but the computing time was much shorter than PZB model, and then was further decreased when introducing an algorithm to compute the minimum number of copied plants around the studied plant stand. Furthermore, the feasibility of simplifications of plant organs was discussed. The results showed that excessive simplifications resulted in increasing the simulation errors noticeably.

0033568784	Markov-chain simulation of soil textural profiles	The spatial change of textural layers is an important feature of alluvial soils. It influences soil water transport and solute movement in the field. Data from one or several soil profiles cannot explain processes of field-water and solute movement in a large region because of spatial variability within textural layers. Two stochastic models - the MC (Markov-chain) model and the MC-LN (Markov-chain - Lognormal distribution) model were developed in this study using Markov-chain theory to simulate textural profiles of regional alluvial soils. Soil textural layers were divided into six types, namely, sand, sandy loam, light loam, medium loam, clay loam, and clay. The two models reflect vertical changes of textural layers of soil profiles in the research region. Excluding the data related to clay loam layers which are quite rare, element values of TPM (transition probability matrix) of textural layers simulated by the MC model deviate less than 15% from measured, and those by the MC-LN model less than 27%. The MC model shows a larger deviation in the probability distribution of textural layer thickness because the simulated textural layer thickness is inclined to be exponentially distributed, but the MC-LN model is consistent to the measured data, which are similar to a lognormal distribution for each textural type. Simulated mean thicknesses of textural layers from the MC-LN model deviate less than 21.1% from measured, and those from the MC model less than 7.1%. These two models will be useful for further constructing a regional model of field water transport with a consideration of the spatial variability of soil textural layers.

39149137817	Temperature-mediated developmental delay may limit yield of cotton in relay intercrops with wheat	In the Yellow River valley of China, more then 1.4 million ha of cotton are grown as relay intercrops with wheat. Cotton is sown in April when winter wheat is already in the reproductive phase; thus, a wheat crop with a fully developed canopy will compete for resources with cotton plants in the seedling stage. Yields of cotton are lower in relay intercropping systems than in a monocrop, but the aggregate yield of the cotton-wheat system is greater than of monocultures of the component crops. We study the hypothesis that the lower yield of intercropped cotton is a consequence of delayed development and fruit formation of the cotton as a result of a lowered temperature experienced by seedlings in the intercrop, compared to monoculture, due to shading by wheat. Field experiments were conducted in 3 subsequent years in Anyang, Henan, China. Wheat and cotton were grown as monocrops and as strip intercrops. Four intercrop layouts were investigated, differing in number of wheat and cotton rows in a strip: 3:1, 3:2, 4:2 and 6:2. Developmental stage of the cotton was recorded at regular intervals during the growing cycle while air and soil temperatures were measured with thermocouples at several soil depths and cross-row positions in the canopy. Temperatures at and near the soil surface were substantially (on average 3 °C) lower in intercrops than in monoculture, especially on sunny days, thus lowering the rate of temperature accumulation of cotton seedlings in intercrops, compared to those in monocultures. Cotton in intercrops showed a pronounced delay in early development, e.g. attainment of the squaring stage, compared to monocrops. The period from planting to first square, expressed in thermal time (TT), lasted 531 °C d in cotton monoculture and 638-670 °C d in intercrops. There were no significant differences in developmental delay between different intercropping patterns. The formation of fruits in intercrops lagged behind by 9-15 d, compared to monoculture, while the number of fruit nodes per plant, averaged over 3 years, was reduced from 30.3 in monocrops to 19.9 in intercrops. The later formation of fruits thus results in a reduction in fruit number and also in a reduction in average age of the fruits, limiting their growth and the sink capacity of the plant as a whole. A plastic film cover increased temperatures in a 3:2 intercrop at the soil surface by 1.9 °C and at 5 cm soil depth by 2.7 °C, thus restoring the thermal conditions to levels common in monoculture. A cover with straw, however, decreased the temperature at the soil surface by 2.9 °C and at 5 cm depth by 1.3 °C. We conclude that the thermal climate in wheat-cotton intercrops is suboptimal for the cotton seedlings. The resulting delay in development of cotton culminates in a lower reproductive capacity and sink capacity. In combination with a reduced source strength, due to later and reduced canopy development in intercropped cotton, these effects result in a lint yield that is substantially lower than in monoculture cotton. This constraint can be ameliorated by measures that improve light capture and heat loading by the cotton, e.g. planting a semi-dwarf wheat or cultivation of cotton on ridges, or application of a plastic film mulch in the cotton seed bed. Early maturing cotton cultivars are at an advantage in intercropping systems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

38749122435	Nitrogen economy in relay intercropping systems of wheat and cotton	Relay intercropping of wheat and cotton is practiced on a large scale in China. Winter wheat is thereby grown as a food crop from November to June and cotton as a cash crop from April to October. The crops overlap in time, growing as an intercrop, from April till June. High levels of nitrogen are applied. In this study, we analyzed the N-economy of the monocultures of cotton and wheat, and of four relay intercropping systems, differing in number of rows per strip of cotton or wheat. Field experiments were carried out from 2001/02 to 2003/04 in the Yellow River region in China. We quantified the nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency of wheat and cotton in relay intercropping systems to test if intercrops are more resource use efficient in comparison to monocrops. Nitrogen (N) yields of wheat per unit area in the four intercropping systems were lower than in the monocrop, which ranged from 203 to 288 kg ha

Methods: Purified sodium alginate (PSA) and non-purified sodium alginate (SA) were used to prepare alginate-based microcapsules, and their biocompatibility and membrane strength were then compared for the purposes of analyzing the advantages of purifying SA. In addition, poly-l-lysine (PLL) was replaced by chitosan for alginate-chitosan microcapsule preparation. The process of optimization and chemical modification of alginate-chitosan microcapsules using polyethylene glycol was also reviewed. Results: Theresults showed improved biocompatibility and membrane strength of PSA-based microcapsules. Under optimal conditions, mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-loaded alginate-chitosan microcapsules with good morphology could be obtained using PSA and chitosans of medium molecular weight (1.0-2.5×105). A chitosan solution of 0.1% (w/v) and a reaction time of 7 min between alginate and chitosan were determined as optimal preparation parameters. Discussion: It could be concluded that the chemical modification of alginate-based microcapsules can improve their biocompatibility.

39649107112	Light interception and utilization in relay intercrops of wheat and cotton	In China, a large acreage of cultivated land is devoted to relay intercropping of winter wheat and cotton. Wheat is sown in strips with interspersed bare soil in October and harvested in June of the next year, while cotton is sown in the interspersed paths in the wheat crop in April and harvested before the next wheat sowing in October. This paper addresses the question how strip width and number of plant rows per strip of wheat or cotton affect light interception (LI) and light use efficiency (LUE) of both component crops. Field experiments were carried out in three consecutive years: 2002, 2003 and 2004. Light interception and productivity were estimated in monocultures of wheat and cotton and four intercropping designs differing in strip and path width as well as number of rows per strip. The intercrop systems were identified by the number of rows per strip of wheat and cotton, respectively, as 3:1, 3:2, 4:2 and 6:2. Total light interception over a season was calculated from LAI measurements, using a model for light interception in a row crop. The spatial distribution and diurnal course of light in intercrops were also measured with sensors. Wheat monocrops intercepted 618 MJ m

31744441850	Parameter optimization and field validation of the functional-structural model GREENLAB for maize	• Background and Aims: There are three reasons for the increasing demand for crop models that build the plant on the basis of architectural principles and organogenetic processes: (1) realistic concepts for developing new crops need to be guided by such models; (2) there is an increasing interest in crop phenotypic plasticity, based on variable architecture and morphology; and (3) engineering of mechanized cropping systems requires information on crop architecture. The functional-structural model GREENLAB was recently presented that simulates resource-dependent plasticity of plant architecture. This study introduces a new methodology for crop parameter optimization against measured data called multi-fitting, validates the calibrated model for maize with independent field data, and describes a technique for 3D visualization of outputs. • Methods: Maize was grown near Beijing during the 2000, 2001 and 2003 (two sowing dates) summer seasons in a block design with four to five replications. Detailed morphological and topological observations were made on the plant architecture throughout the development of the four crops. Data obtained in 2000 was used to establish target files for parameter optimization using the generalized least square method, and parameter accuracy was evaluated by coefficient of variance. In situ plant digitization was used to establish 3D symbol files for organs that were then used to translate model outputs directly into 3D representations for each time step of model execution. • Key Results and Conclusions: Multi-fitting against several target files obtained at different growth stages gave better parameter accuracy than single fitting at maturity only, and permitted extracting generic organ expansion kinetics from the static observations. The 2000 model gave excellent predictions of plant architecture and vegetative growth for the other three seasons having different temperature regimes, but predictions of inter-seasonal variability of biomass partitioning during grain filling were less accurate. This was probably due to insufficient consideration of processes governing cob sink size and terminal leaf senescence. Further perspectives for model improvement are discussed. © The Author 2006.

Thereafter, soil water and solute transport with root-water-uptake in a soil-wheat system were simulated numerically, in which the estimated RLD distributions were incorporated. The results showed that the estimated RLD distributions of winter wheat using the neural network model combined with the improved genetic algorithm, as well as the simulated soil water content and salinity distributions, were comparably well with the experimental data.

Methods Twenty five subcutaneously prevascularized streptozocin(STZ)-induced diabetic mice using microencapsulated islets for transplantation were equally randomized to 5 groups: Group A, using SD rat islets coencapsulated with GF for prevascularized subcutaneous transplantation; Group B, using encapsulated rat islets for prevascularization subcutaneous transplantation; Group C, D and E, serving as controls. Post-transplantation blood glucose and body weight of STZ-induced diabetic mice were observed. The number of surviving rat islets was counted 8 weeks after transplantation. Results The mean blood glucose level of Group A and B was normalized 7 days after transplantation. Xenotransplantation reversed the loss of body weight and led to a continuous increase in body weight, the difference between the two groups being insignificant. DTZ-positive microencapsules were counted 8 weeks after transplantation. More DTZ-positive microencapsules were found in Group A (F = 36. 84, P<0. 01). Conclusions Rat islets coencapsulated with GF prevascularization subcutaneous transplantation is an effective strategy for promoting prolifer ation and regeneration of islets and improves survival of encapsulated islets of diabetic animals.

41149168799	High precision topographic data on Lop Nor basin's Lake "great Ear" and the timing of its becoming a dry salt lake	High precision elevation measurements using DGPS were carried out along three representative transects for the "Great Ear" area, a dry salt lake within the Lop Nor basin. Results indicate that the Lop Nor basin is only 5.2 m deep and its lowest point occurs at the center of the "Great Ear". In addition, the basin is asymmetric - steeper in the southwest (0.19‰) and gentler in the northeast (0.09‰). Points along the same "Great Ear" ring were found to have an identical elevation value, but different when from different ones (lower towards the center). The spacing of the "Great Ear" rings was found to be closely related with the surface steepness. The closer the "Great Ear" rings are spaced, the steeper the ground surface, and vice versa. These findings support the argument that the "Great Ear" rings are the former shoreline trails left behind by Lop Nor water during the last few episodes of recession towards its total dry up. A comprehensive analysis of the high precision elevation data, historical accounts, aerial and satellite photographs and imagery, and official topographic maps of the study area suggests that the "Great Ear" area in the Lop Nor basin was incorrectly mapped as being covered by a great body of water on the 1963 topographic maps. A re-interpretation of the 1958 aerial photographs and newer remote sensing imagery indicated that the "Great Ear" ring structure was already in place in 1958 and it continued to appear on the subsequent remote sensing data without any major changes. It is estimated that lake water in the "Great Ear" area of the Lop Nor basin disappeared between the late 1930s and early 1940s. © 2008 Science in China Press.

This study is aim to simulate the R/FR signal received by maize plants based on a 3D canopy radiative model. Optical properties of maize leaf were characterized by an adapted Cook-Torrance model for reflectance and a Lambert model for transmittance. Virtual maize canopies were reconstructed with triangle facets by digitizing the 3D architecture of maize plants in the field. The distributions of red and far-red light within canopies were simulated by Monte Carlo ray tracing methods. R/FR received by triangle facets of canopies was calculated from these red and far-red light distributions. Finally, the distributions of R/FR within two maize canopies at two growth stages were simulated under three solar angles. Low R/FR in the canopy of maize at filling stage indicated potential competition of neighboring plants. Solar angles change the distribution of R/FR within canopy. It is recommended to be examined on the whole day time course that covering a large range of solar angles. © 2010 IEEE.

Specific plant topology and sink-source parameters were estimated for Mongolian Scots pine trees through optimizing procedure. The fitting results showed that the calibration process were reasonable and acceptable. The model produced a variety of three-dimensional visual representations of Mongolian Scots pine trees with different topological structures simulated by Monte Carlo methods.

The aim of this paper was to evaluate the influence of leaf angle and leaf area index (LAI) on light interception efficiency and capacity of biomass production of rice using 3-D models. A group of virtual plant types of rice, with different combinations of leaf angles, was designed based on the 3-D data of a real rice canopy which was digitized in situ in the field at the filling stage. The results indicated that plant types with excessively steep leaves could lead a significant decrease of photosynthesis at higher solar inclination angle. An optimum LAI corresponding to the peak photosynthetic rate can be found for each of the plant type. To overcome the obstacle of heavy computing in this study, computer cluster and message passing interface were used to provide an efficient and economical way for simulating the 3-D light distribution and photosynthetic rate in rice canopies. © 2010 IEEE.

77954308226	Three-dimensional reconstruction and visualization of xylem vessels of wheat nodal root	Descriptions of root internal structure are often limited to 2D cross-sections, with little information about three dimensions, and the evolution of xylem vessels along root axis has not been clearly presented. A computer-aided 3D-reconstrution method was developed based on paraffin serial slices techniques. The image processing protocol involved slice images alignment, registration, and 3D reconstruction. The stability of this approach was quantified and proven to be satisfactory. The 3D reconstruction conducted on wheat nodal roots illustrated that metaxylem vessel number decreased along root axis. Most vessels connected to the existent or new-formed vessels by lateral cell walls before disappearing. Thus metaxylem vessels in longitudinal profiles were not straightforward. The proposed imaging technique was low cost. It allowed various visualizations and quantitative comparisons of root structures. In the ongoing work, the technique is used to illustrate the spatial coordination of the radial pathway (passage cells, lateral roots), and longitudinal conduits (xylem vessels) of water and nutrient transport. © 2010 IEEE.

The Richards equation with a certain initial and boundary condition was used to describe the processes of the soil water movement. The influence of distribution of soil water contain to biomass partitioning and spatial extending direction was realised using electro-resistance method based values of several key points, while the influence of root system to soil water distribution was simulated by root uptake processes.

77954819594	New spectral indicator assessing the efficiency of crop nitrogen treatment in corn and wheat	To reduce environment pollution from cropping activities, a reliable indicator of crop N status is needed for site-specific N management in agricultural fields. Nitrogen Nutrition Index (NNI) can be a valuable candidate, but its measurement relies on tedious sampling and laboratory analysis. This study proposes a new spectral index to estimate plant nitrogen (N) concentration, which is a critical component of NNI calculation. Hyperspectral reflectance data, covering bands from 325 to 1075nm, were collected using a ground-based spectroradiometer on corn and wheat crops at different growth stages from 2005 to 2008. Data from 2006 to 2008 was used for new index development and the comparison of the new index with some existing indices. Data from 2005 was used to validate the best index for predicting plant N concentration. Additionally, a hyperspectral image of corn field in 2005 was acquired using an airborne Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI), and the corresponding plant N concentration was obtained by conventional laboratory methods on selected area. These data were also used for validation. A new N index, named Double-peak Canopy Nitrogen Index (DCNI), was developed and compared to the existing indices that were used for N detection. In this study, DCNI was the best spectral index for predicting plant N concentration, with R

84861562002	Study on drought index in major planting area of winter wheat of China	Based on an empirical parameterization of the relationship between surface temperature (Ts) and vegetation index (NDVI), Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) has been widely used for drought monitoring as a simplified index. Due to the complexity of land-cover and climate, the result might often not be satisfied using the only TVDI to monitor drought. Integrated drought monitoring index (IDMI) was promoted as an integrated linear form on the basis of combining TVDI and percentage of precipitation anomalies index (PPAI). The index was used for monitoring drought in China's major growing areas of winter wheat at various growing stages namely, returning green stage, jointing stage, heading stage, flowering stage and milk stage. The result showed that IDMI had a more significant correlation with soil moisture in depth 10 cm than TVDI in 2009 and 2010, and it could reflect the drought tendency of large scale areas better, especially those in worse conditions. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

84887302947	Comparison between eddy covariance and automatic chamber techniques for measuring net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide in cotton and wheat fields	Static and transparent automatic chamber (AC) technique is a necessary choice for measuring net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) in circumstances where eddy covariance (EC) technique is not applicable. However, a comparison of the two techniques for measurements on croplands has seldom been undertaken. We carried out NEE observations in a cotton field (for one year) and a winter wheat field (for one cropping season) using both AC and EC techniques, to (a) compare the NEE fluxes measured using each technique, and (b) test the NEE measurement performance of an automatic chamber system (AMEG), which was designed for simultaneous flux measurements of multiple gases. The half-hourly NEE fluxes measured with the two techniques were in approximate agreement, with the AC fluxes being 0.78 (cotton) and 1.06 (wheat) times the size of the EC fluxes. When integrated to daily timescale, the fluxes of the two techniques were in better agreement, showing an average ratio of 0.94 and 1.00 for the cotton and wheat, respectively. During the periods with comparable field conditions and normal performance of both instruments, the cumulative NEE fluxes revealed small differences between the two techniques (-9.0% ∼ 7%, with a mean of 0.1%). The measurements resulted in an annual cumulative NEE of -40 g C m-2 yr-1 (EC) and -42 g C m-2 yr-1 (AC) in the cotton field, and a seasonal cumulative NEE of -251 g C m-2 (EC) and -205 g C m-2 (AC) in the wheat field. Our results indicate that, for cropland populated by short plants, the AMEG system and the data processing procedures applied in this study are able to provide NEE estimates comparable to those from EC measurements. © Author(s) 2013.

84897894306	Spatial scaling effects on variability of soil organic matter and total nitrogen in suburban Beijing	Understanding the spatial distribution of soil organic matter (SOM) and total nitrogen (STN) at different scales is helpful for elucidating relationships between soil properties, environmental factors and human activities. The objectives of this study were to compare the spatial patterns of SOM and STN and to explore the main factors affecting SOM and STN distribution in suburban Beijing at three spatial scales: large-scale (Pinggu County), medium scale (Plain area) and small-scale (Machangying town). For the county and plain scales, a total of 973 soil samples (0-20cm) were collected on a 400×400m grid across an area of 1075km

84907893385	Design of county-level soil information system based on Web-GIS	Science research and production practice have accumulated a large number of soil data, which is the valuable essential data for practice and research. It is significant for sustainable land use to enhance soil information management and sharing. But currently the construction of county level soil information system is facing many issues such as the high cost, difficult to maintain, and performance bottlenecks, etc. In this paper, a low-cost open-source Web GIS platform (MapGuide Open Source) was adopted to design and develop a county-level soil information system (CLSIS) for Lishu county based on the second soil survey database and other soil data in Visual Studio.Net. The system development was divided into four stages: system requirement analysis, system design, system implementation and system testing. The system was designed as a three-tier Server/Brower open application system. Client tier may be a browser terminal or a management terminal. Web tier, deployed on the internet information server, was responsible for receiving requests from browsers, passing the requests to the application server and returning the response to browsers. Application tier was composed of a GIS server (MapGuide Open Source 2.1), a database server and a remote Web Map Service (WMS) component. The database was organized as the attribute database and spatial database, respectively. The attribute database includes the soil basic information table, soil physical properties table, soil chemical properties table, geomorphology table, and land use and administrative table. Among all spatial data, the soil, topography, land use and administrative maps are vector layers, but the precipitation and temperature are stored as raster format. The server-side of CLSIS provided map services, feature services, render services and image services. The functions of server-side were implemented by C# and MapGuide Server API in Visual Studio.Net. The browser-side programming is applied with fusion flexible page layout solution, which has better flexibility, scalability and response speed. Fusion framework is an expanded JavaScript library derived from OpenLayers and JXLib. The system built up a dynamic contact with Google WMS, facilitating the switch of base map among the standard, satellite, hybrid and terrain. Google WMS enhanced the visual effect and intuitive feelings of CLSIS. The system maintenance and management is mainly done by MapGuide Maestro, which is a client software based on Client/Server structure. The centralized management makes system maintenance and upgrades more convenient. CLSIS realizes the map navigation, map services, feature services and thematic mapping functions. By utilizing these functions mentioned above, users can conveniently query and browse soil resources and other relevant geographic background informations for Lishu county. The available soil data include soil type, soil texture, soil parent materials, soil organic matter, the thickness of humus, pH value, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium, trace elements and soil water retention, etc. The operation result shows that the system reaches a good balance between cost of development/maintenance and performance. This system will be a basic county level soil information platform for further expansion in the application of multiple fields.

49249119862	Modelling three-dimensional architecture of pine tree (Pinus sylvestris Linn. var. mongolica Litv.) in a semiarid area	A dynamic model for three-dimensional (3D) simulation of pine tree (Pinus sylvestris Linn, var. mongolica Litv) architecture based on dual-scale automata is presented. The developmental sequence of pine trees was analysed qualitatively by identification of types of organs and elementary units. A dual-scale automata model was used to describe the topological structure of the pine tree. The model is a collection of a large number of elementary units corresponding to the organs of the tree. The time step of simulation is set for 1 year. The model stochastically simulates the 3D architecture of a pine tree crown based on the Monte Carlo method and has been parameterised for juvenile pine trees. Topological and geometrical parameters were calculated using a large amount of field data of branch number and internode lengths and diameters for 1- to 6-year-old pine trees. Visualisation of a 3D pine tree is presented. The model provides a good quantitative description of the 3D architecture of a single pine tree crown. © The Royal Society of New Zealand 2007.

49249120325	Monte Carlo simulation of solar radiation in maize canopies and its visualisation	The spatial distribution of solar radiation casts important influences on eco-physiological functions of plant canopies. A simulation model of the three-dimensional (3D) effect of direct and indirect solar radiation in real maize canopies is developed from measured 3D canopy structure meshes. The model includes two procedures: parallel direct light pass and diffusive indirect radiation pass. The former one is based on the Monte Carlo ray tracing algorithm. After enough ray casting, the radiation is obtained. Then, the diffusive indirect radiation pass uses a modified Monte Carlo radiosity model to evaluate the diffusion distribution. Results indicate that simulated sun fleck ratio is significantly consistent with the measured dataset. © The Royal Society of New Zealand 2007.

5044228551	Modeling the branching patterns of peach tree branches (Prunus persica) after being pruned	The shoot branching patterns of the two-year-old branches of peach trees (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch cv. Elberta) were compared with different pruning measures. The branches were divided into a basal non-branching zone, a proleptic branching zone, a sylleptic branching zone and the part removed. We used the hidden semi-Markov model to capture the branching patterns. The final results showed that theoretical probability distributions of diverse lateral shoots of the parent branches calculated on the basis of the parameters of the hidden semi-Markov chain model were in good agreement with probabilities extracted from the observed data. This paper described the quantitative effects of pruning on branching architecture of a parent branch, taking into account of branch morphology. Results suggest that the hidden semi-Markov model could be used as an effective tool to describe the branching patterns. In addition, the application of hidden semi-Markov models to predict the effects of pruning on peach tree branching pattern based on growth parameters was discussed.

51349143557	Parameterization of bidirectional reflection from maize leaves with measurement in the principal plane	Characterization of bidirectional reflectance distribution of individual leaf is essential in canopy radiative transfer modeling. Measuring bidirectional reflection over reflectance hemisphere is a very complex and time-consuming work. Considering that leaf's reflection is a linear combination of specular and diffuse component, where specular reflection is centered on mirror direction in the principal plane and diffuse reflection is uniform regardless of directions, we made an attempt to parameterize Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) over reflectance hemisphere from angular distribution of reflection in its principal plane. Angular reflection of maize (Zea mays I) leaves over reflectance hemisphere was measured with a custom-designed device. The leaves were illuminated with two wavelengths of 650 nm and 830 nm, at three incidence angles of 0°, 30° and 60°. Reflection measured in the principal plane was used to model BRDF with a physically based BRDF model. They were used to predict the reflection in other directions outside the principal plane. The predicted reflection was in a good agreement with those measured. It indicates that reflection distribution in the principal plane carries sufficient information to characterize the BRDF over hemisphere. © 2007 IEEE.

51349146523	Characterizing wheat root branching using a Markov chain approach	Root system architecture is an important factor influencing plant exploitation efficiency for edaphic resources. However, the difficulty to predict the distribution of laterals severely hampers root system architecture analysis. A Markov chain approach was adopted to characterize the succession of laterals along the mother root axis, using data collected from studies with contrasting P supplies and with different degrees of compaction of growth substrate. The main findings were that successive lateral roots were generally separated by a minimum inter-lateral distance, and neither compaction of root medium nor the phosphorus availabilities affected the distance and succession pattern of lateral roots along the main roots. The results from the Markov chain model were consistent with the findings by other researchers using different approaches. Further study with similar approach but considering local variation of soil chemical and physical conditions should give more insight into the plasticity of root system architecture. © 2007 IEEE.

51349166664	Calibration of GREENLAB model for maize with sparse experimental data	Simplification of field measurement to reduce the time-consuming data collection for calibration is important to facilitate the application of the GREENLAB model. The effect of such simplifications on the accuracy of parameter values should be quantified in order to define to what extent simplifications are valid. This study introduced a new method for model parameter optimization with sparse data of maize using a multi-fitting technique, evaluated the effect of such simplifications on the parameter values, and validated the calibrated model with four independent field data sets. The results showed that coefficients of variance (CV) among different simplifications were below 15% for most parameter values. The parameter values of the beta function varied more compared with those of relative sink strength for different simplifications. Organ biomass under four different climate regimes was simulated based on parameter values optimized with a sparse dataset. Significant (P<0.05) deviations of simulation vs. observation correlations from the 1:1 relationship were only observed for internodes of second experiment in 2003. Thus, multi-fitting with sparse data can provide reasonable accuracy of parameter values. © 2007 IEEE.

51149103972	Analytical solution of heat pulse method in a parallelepiped sample space with inclined needles	The heat pulse method enables estimation of soil thermal diffusivity (k), volumetric heat capacity (C), thermal conductivity, and water content. The heater needle and temperature-sensing needle may deflect during probe insertion into soils. The impact of needle deflection on estimates of C and k has not been fully studied theoretically or experimentally. We defined θ to be the polar angle of needle deviation from the z axis and φ to be the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. Transient-state analytical solutions were derived for an inclined and pulsed finite line source in a parallelepiped sample with zero surface temperature and adiabatic boundary conditions. For a heat pulse sensor with 6-mm needle spacing and a heater needle of 4-cm length in a given parallelepiped (5 by 5 by 5 cm, assumed to be filled with airdry sand), model errors in C and k were about -11.3 and 12.1%, respectively, for an inclined heater needle with θ = 1° and φ = 0°. Model errors in C and k were about -11.2 and 12.1%, respectively, for an inclined sensor needle with θ = 1° and φ = 180°. When -6 ≤ θ ≤ 6° for either the heater or the sensor needle, the temperature curves could be approximated rather well by a pulsed infinite line source model with a modified probe spacing that accounted for the inclination. For various heating durations and strengths, the errors in both k and C were relatively constant when all other parameters were fixed; however, the errors in both C and k decreased monotonically and slowly as k increased. The model errors in C and k were similar for four soil conditions with different thermal properties in the range -6 ≤ θ ≤ 2°. © Soil Science Society of America. All rights reserved.

55949122460	Estimating photosynthetically active radiation distribution in maize canopies by a three-dimensional incident radiation model	The three-dimensional (3-D) radiation distribution model in plant canopy is pivotal for understanding and modelling plant eco-physiological processes. Diffuse and direct radiations penetrate into plant canopies in different ways and may present different intensity and wavelength composition. Sunfleck (the canopy surfaces where the direct radiation reaches) distribution in the plant canopy is usually regarded as an important index for crop development, especially under dense canopy conditions. Distributions of direct and diffuse components of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in maize (Zea mays L.) canopies were estimated respectively using a 3-D incident radiation model (3DIRM). The 3DIRM model was set up for computing incident radiation in crop canopies by applying a parallel-projection based submodel for direct solar radiation and a central-projection based submodel for incident diffuse radiation simulation in crop canopy. It was well assessed with a field experiment with multi-point PAR measurement in maize canopies with relative errors of 2.6, 4.5 and 2.6%, respectively, for sunfleck area ratio, diffuse PAR and total PAR. The results suggest that the 3DIRM model could be used to estimate the direct, diffuse and total PAR at any specific surface part in the 3-D canopy space. The exponential distinction model for direct, diffuse and total PAR along with leaf area index in different heights in maize canopies was also evaluated based on the 3DIRM simulation results. © CSIRO 2008.

55949129100	Comparison of architecture among different cultivars of hybrid rice using a spatial light model based on 3-D digitising	Modification of plant types (i.e. plant architecture) is an important strategy to enhance the yield potential of crops. The aims of this study were to specify rice plant types using 3-D modelling methodology. The architecture of three typical hybrid rice cultivars were measured in situ in a paddy field using a 3-D digitiser at four development stages from the panicle initiation to the filling stage. The structural parameters of the rice canopies were calculated and their light capture and potential carbon gain were simulated based on a 3-D light model. The results confirmed that a plant type with steeper leaf angles let light penetrate more deeply with relatively uniform light distribution in the canopy at higher sun elevation angles, although this result was related to leaf area index. The variations of plant types, however, did not convert into differences of light distribution across rice varieties at lower sun elevation angles. Light use efficiency at the higher leaf area index could be enhanced by reducing mutual-shading. These results indicate that a promising approach to quantify the rice architecture in situ is to combine 3-D digitising and a 3-D light model to evaluate light interception and photosynthesis of rice plant types. © CSIRO 2008.

60449095432	Development and validation of SUCROS-cotton: A potential crop growth simulation model for cotton	A model for the development, growth and potential production of cotton (SUCROS-Cotton) was developed. Particular attention was given to the phenological development of the plant and the plasticity of fruit growth in response to temperature, radiation, daylength, variety traits, and management. The model is characterized by a comparatively simple code and transparent algorithms. The model was parameterized for Chinese cotton varieties and validated with extensive independent datasets on cotton growth and production from the Yellow River region and Xinjiang Province. The model validation showed that the phenology, growth and yield were simulated satisfactorily. The root mean square error (RMSE) for date of emergence, date of flowering, date of open boll stage and duration from sowing to boll opening was less than four calendar days, both for cotton grown in monoculture and cotton grown in a relay intercropping system with wheat. The RMSE of predicted total dry matter compared with observations was at most 6.6%, of lint yield 6.6%, and for number of harvestable bolls 10.0%. SUCROS-Cotton provides a tool to (1) assess production opportunities of cotton in various ecological zones in response to temperature, incoming radiation and management, (2) identify optimal cotton ideotypes for different agro-ecological conditions and for guiding breeding efforts, and (3) explore resource-use-efficient cropping systems, including intercropping options, and crop management practices such as plastic film mulching and sowing date.

65449124289	Multi-scale spatial structure of heavy metals in Beijing cultivated soils	In order to effectively reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of soil heavy metals and provide scientific basis for environmental quality assessment in Beijing cultivated soils, geo-statistics was used to explore the scale effect of spatial structure of heavy metals in Beijing cultivated soils. The results showed that spatial structure of Cr, Ni, Zn and Hg had distinct dependence on spatial scale. According to the optimality test of theoretical semi-variance function, the spatial structure of Cr, Ni, Zn and Hg could be described fully by multi-scale nested model. In addition, the spatial interpolation accuracy of Cr, Ni, Zn and Hg using the multi-scale nested model was higher than that using the ordinary Kriging at a single scale. Therefore, the multi-scale nested model can estimate the spatial distribution characteristics of soil heavy metals more effectively than the ordinary Kriging method.

65649093756	Micromorphological analysis of soil structure under no tillage management in the black soil zone of Northeast China	The structure of the "black soil" in Northeast China has been greatly deteriorated by long-term intensive conventional mouldboard plow tillage (CT) practices. In this study, micromorphological observation and image analysis of soil thin sections were conducted to evaluate the impacts of 21 years (1986-2007) of no tillage (NT) on soil structure as compared to CT in an experiment near Gongzhuling City, Jilin Province. Soil organic matter (SOM), wet aggregate stability and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) were also analyzed. Total SOM was not significantly affected by tillage systems, but fresher SOM was observed in the surface layer under NT. The aggregates under NT showed different hierarchies in the form of crumbs, and the mean weight diameter (MWD) of NT was significant higher than that of CT in the surface layer. Platy and blocky aggregates were frequently observed in the lower layers under CT practice. The compound pore structure with intertwined intra- and inter- aggregates pores under NT was well developed in a layer from 0-5 cm to 20-25 cm. While under CT system, more inter-aggregate pores and fewer intraaggregate pores were observed, and planes and channels were frequently found in the 20-25 cm layer, where macroporosity decreased significantly and a plow pan was evident. The Ks values of NT were significantly lower at 0-5 cm but significantly higher at 20-25 cm compared with CT, which showed the same trend with macroporosity. These results confirmed that long-term CT practice fragmented the tillage layer soil and compacted the lower layer soil and formed a plow pan. While long-term NT practice in the black soil region favored soil aggregation and a stable porous soil structure was formed, which are important to the water infiltration and prevent soil erosion. © Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.

67649206743	Spatial autocorrelation analysis of heavy metals in cultivated soils in Beijing	Moran's I statistics was applied to describe the spatial autocorrelation coefficients, correlation distance and spatial pattern of heavy metals in cultivated soils in Beijing. Significant spatial autocorrelations were detected for 8 heavy metals and the autocorrelation distances were; Cr, 57; Ni, 75; Zn, 57; Hg, 55; Cu, 55; Pb, 65; As, 74 km; and Cd, 37 km. Local Moran's I was used to analyze the spatial distribution pattern of the heavy metals and identify the spatial clusters and spatial outliers. Taking Cr and Hg as examples, clusters of high-high Cr were observed in northeast Beijing (Miyun county, Huairou and Pinggu districts) and in the Changping, Mentougou and Tongzhou districts. Clusters of low-low Cr were identified in the Fangshan, Daxing and Shunyi districts. Clusters of high-high Hg were distributed in the urban fringe. Outliers of low-high were found near clusters of high-high and outliers of high-low near clusters of low-low. The spatial distribution of heavy metals particularly clusters of high-high and outliers of low-high which have potential pollution risks, play a key role in the assessment of the environmental quality of soils.

67349171044	Improved properties of medium-density particleboard manufactured from saline Creeping Wild Rye and HDPE plastic	Creeping Wild Rye (CWR), Leymus triticoides, is a salt-tolerant perennial grass used for mitigating the problems of saltilization and alkalization in drainage irrigation water and soil to minimize potential pollution of water streams. In this study, CWR was used as a raw material to manufacture medium-density particleboard. The objective of this research was to characterize the mechanical and water resistance properties of CWR particleboards bonded by four different adhesive levels and compositions, including 4% polymeric methane diphenyl diisocyanate (PMDI), 2.8% PMDI, [1.2% rice bran adhesive (RBA) + 2.8% PMDI] and [20% recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) + 2.8% PMDI]. In addition, orthogonal experimental design was employed to optimize three factors (hot-press temperature, HDPE particle size and HDPE content) to achieve desired mechanical and water resistance properties of particleboards bonded by a mixture adhesive. The evaluated mechanical properties of particleboards were tensile strength (TS), modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), and internal bond (IB) strength. Water absorption (WA) and thickness swelling (THS) were measured to determine water resistance properties of the particleboards. Partially replacing PMDI with RBA did not compromise mechanical quality, but deteriorated water resistance properties. The results showed that 30% of PMDI can be replaced by adding 20% HDPE, resulting in particleboard with higher mechanical strength and water resistance than particleboard made without HDPE. It has been concluded that HDPE from recycled plastic bags could be used as an adhesive or additive to partially replace PMDI for making high-quality particleboards.

68949178689	Comparison of sequential indicator simulation and transition probability indicator simulation used to model clay content in microscale surface soil	Quantitative study of the spatial distribution of soil clay content is crucial to soil microecological research, soil physical and chemical properties, and agricultural and environmental management. In this article, the distribution of clay content within a 1-m soil body was selected as the study object. The soil clay content was measured with a laser grain-size analyzer and classified into indicator data. The spatial variability of the data was then analyzed by indicator variogram and transiogram. The results of the indicator variogram showed that the spatial distribution of clay content in a horizontal direction is highly random. However, the results of the transiogram of clay content exhibited obvious spatial juxtapositional tendencies both vertically and horizontally. Subsequently, sequential indicator simulation (SIS) and transition probability indicator simulation (TPROGS) were applied to create conditional realizations of the 1-m soil body. Finally, the realizations were validated by reproduction of a histogram, connectivity, as well as mean absolute error of prediction. The results indicated that the major textural classes were overestimated, whereas the minor classes were underestimated in the SIS-generated histogram, whereas all classes were well reproduced in the TPROGS. In addition, compared with the measured data, the connectivity of SIS realizations was significantly reduced, whereas the connectivity of TPROGS was coherent with measured data, which indicated that the crucial spatial characteristics, which were neglected by SIS, can be captured by TPROGS, even if the accuracy of prediction is similar. Therefore, the TPROGS method is a suitable method for characterizing the distribution of clay content in soil. The results may provide useful information for soil research. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

0034499543	Spatial variability of the regional shallow groundwater depth and water quality	139 observing points were sampled in Quzhou County in Huabei plain. The depth of groundwater, salt and nitrate content of groundwater were measured. The geostatistics theory was applied to analyze the data. The results indicated that the depth of groundwater showed a normal distribution, the salt content showed a lognormal distribution and the nitrate content showed neither a normal nor a lognormal distribution. The rational sampling number was determined within a given precision at a known confidence level. By the semivariance analysis those observe items were correlated in a given spatial range. The Kriging method was applied to estimate the unobserved points and generate the contour map. These results show some merit in rational using the groundwater resource and preventing soil secondary salinization and the nitrate pollution.

0035275852	Water and nitrogen optimal management under agricultural field of the North China Plain	The North China Plain was selected as the research region of this paper. Based on data of the Second National General Soil Survey, a simplified distribution map of soil types in the North China Plain was obtained with geographic information system (GIS) method (ARC/INFO). There were 72 soil types with the representative profiles. A multiple goal hybrid programming model was also established in this paper, based on the simulation of regional soil water and nitrogen behaviors under agricultural field. Its programming variables were irrigation and nitrogen application. The programming goals were grain yields, nitrogen leaching, at 1 meter depth, water use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). A linear weight coefficient selection method was employed to resolve the programming model. Suitable quantities of water and nitrogen of winter wheat-summer maize rotation system were determined for 6 soils with different texture in different hydrologic year types.

74049145720	Simulation of tropisms of three tropisms of root system growth based on feedbacks between functions and structures	It is very important to quantitatively study spatial growth and distribution of root system in precision agriculture, which can optimize the use efficiency of soil water and nutrient, and minimize the impacts of fertilizer to ecological environment. However, the spatial growth and distribution of root system were influenced mainly by the growth direction of root individual which was induced by geotropism, hydrotropism and nutrient-tropism. The growth process of root system in 3D soil space was implemented using the root functional-structural model developed by the principles of GREENLAB. The regions in which root system grows and develops were discretized by 3D spatial voxels. Having defined the voxels, the soil moistures and nutrients of local area which surrounded the root segment could be calculated by spatial collision detection technique. After obtaining the soil moistures and nutrients, the electro-impedance functions were used to adjust the sinks, while the growth direction of each root segment generated in current growth cycle was recalculated by the adjusted functional and structural parameters. With the help of multi-needle data structure, the dynamic storing of new root segment and visiting of all root system in each growth cycle was implemented. Finally, given some scenarios of spatial moisture and nutrient distribution, the geotropism, hydrotropism and nutrient-tropism of growth and development of root system were realized in the homogenous soil using the visual way, in which the parameters were from literatures.

77649210950	Modeling nitrate leaching and optimizing water and nitrogen management under irrigated maize in desert Oases in northwestern China	Understanding water and N transport through the soil pro. le is important for effcient irrigation and nutrient management to minimize nitrate leaching to the groundwater, and to promote agricultural sustainable development in desert oases. In this study, a process-based water and nitrogen management model (WNMM) was used to simulate soil water movement, nitrate transport, and crop growth (maize [Zea mays L.]) under desert oasis conditions in northwestern China. The model was calibrated and validated with a field experiment. The model simulation results showed that about 35% of total water input and 58% of the total N input were leached to <1.8 m depth under traditional management practice. Excessive irrigation and N fertilizer application, high nitrate concentration in the irrigation water, together with the sandy soil texture, resulted in large nitrate leaching. Nitrate leaching was significantly reduced under the improved management practice suggested by farm extension personnel; however, the water and nitrate inputs still far exceeded the crop requirements. More than 1700 scenarios combining various types of irrigation and fertilizer practices were simulated. Quantitative analysis was conducted to obtain the best management practices (BMPs) with simultaneous consideration of crop yield, water use efficiency, fertilizer N use efficiency, and nitrate leaching. The results indicated that the BMPs under the specific desert oasis conditions are to irrigate the maize with 600 mm of water in eight times with a single fertilizer application at a rate of 75 kg N ha

77949556640	New index for crop canopy fresh biomass estimation	The objective of the present study is to propose a new vegetation index for corn canopy fresh biomass estimation, which improves the ability to accurately estimate high biomass levels by remote sensing technology. For this purpose, hyperspectral reflectance data of corn canopies were collected using a ground-based spectroradiometer during different field campaigns in a region of Quebec (Canada), from 2004to 2008. Corresponding fresh biomass values were obtained by destructive measurements, and a hyperspectral image was also acquired using the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) in 2005. A new biomass index named red-edge triangular vegetation index (RTVI) was designed and compared to existing indices used for fresh biomass estimation. The results showed that RTVI was the best vegetation index for predicting canopy fresh biomass, with sustained sensitivity at high fresh biomass levels. The best regression model between RTVI and canopy fresh biomass was the power fit, with determination coefficient (R

77950865842	Analysis of the anisotropic spatial variability and three-dimensional computer simulation of agricultural soil bulk density in an alluvial plain of north China	Statistical analysis of the heterogeneity of soil bulk density in regional scale is important to crop growth and tillage management. While most field data focus on bulk density up to a depth of 0.3 m, this study measured the bulk density of 28 in situ soil core locations up to a depth of 1.3 m. Geostatistical method was used to analyze the anisotropic spatial variability and three-dimensional Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGSIM) was conducted. The results of nugget/sill ratio indicated that the sampling scheme was fine enough to capture the spatial correlation distance of bulk density in the vertical direction. The nugget effect, however, in the horizontal direction suggested that the sampling frequency was not enough for bulk density in that direction. The result of three-dimensional SGSIM is consistent with measured data, indicating that the simulation method is suitable for this research objective. The results may provide basic information for other agricultural management practices. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

77950534680	Assessing grain crop water productivity of China using a hydro-model-coupled-statistics approach. Part I: Method development and validation	Identifying and quantifying the links between water resources and food production is crucial in addressing the intensified conflicts between water scarcity and food security. We proposed an integrated framework for quantifying relationships between food and water based on the concept of green water (GW), blue water (BW) and crop water productivity (CWP). An estimation method coupling hydrologic model and crop and water statistics was developed and validated to quantify basin-scale GW, BW and CWP in breadbasket basins of China. A basin-scale GW and BW assessment method was developed by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Monthly-step calibration and validation were performed at 15 discharge flow stations in seven first-order river basins of the country. The coefficient of determination (r

During the process of sterilization in fresh-cut vegetables, the concentration of chloric disinfectant is usually so high that the common sensor can't be used directly on the product line. In order to solve this problem, we have invented a new detecting apparatus which could detect high concentration of chloric disinfectant directly. In this paper, the working principle, main monitor indicators, application and technical creations of the on-line apparatus have been discussed, and we also carried on the experimental analysis for its performance. The actual demands in factory could be met when the detecting flux is 2L/min, the dilution ratio is 15 and input amount of the disinfectant is 200ml per time, the max of the detecting deviation achieves ±4.8ppm(mg/L). The main detecting range of residual chlorine is 0∼300ppm. © 2010 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

77957915997	Digital soil mapping to enable classification of the salt-affected soils in desert agro-ecological zones	Digital soil mapping is critical when quantifying the relationship between soil types and their associated bio-physical environments. Digital mapping of regional soils affected by salt is essential when monitoring the dynamics of soil salts and planning land development and reclamatation schemes. In this paper, an easy method for digitally mapping salt-affected soils is proposed. This method allows the construction of the quantitative lower categories of soil classification based on Chinese Soil Taxonomy by using a geostatistical method and GIS technology. The data and maps used in this study were collected during a soil survey of salt-affected desert agro-ecological zones in Karamay, Xinjiang Autonomous Region, China.

77957559416	Trends in China's agricultural water use during recent decade using the green and blue water approach	China agricultural water use and management are facing enormous challenges in the 21st century. The core concepts of the paradigm shift in the global scientific research and public policy are regarding the agricultural water use and management in the last decade, i.e., green water (GW), blue water (BW), the crop water productivity (CWP), and the broadly-defined agricultural water resources (BAWR), as well as matching between the cropland and the BAWR. Using these concepts, we propose an integrated framework for assessing China's agricultural water use of 1998-2007. The results reveal that among all the water that is potentially available for the cropland use, the GW contribution accounts for 57% and the remaining 43% are coming from BW. The CWP of major grain crops have already been at or approaching to the higher levels as measured by the international standards. Further improvement on the subject is thus limited. Based upon our estimated value of BAWR, the bottom line of water resources for the China's food security should then be set at 7800×10

The objective of this research is to analysis the effect of climate change and variability on reference evapotranspiration and crop water requirements. Based on the historical meteorological dataÿPenman-Monteith equation and approaches recommended by FAO, reference evapotranspiration and crop water requirements which derived by ETo times crop coefficients, were calculated, and change trends and causes were analyzed also for winter wheat and summer corn in Hebei Province, China during 1965-1999. The results showed that reference evapotranspiration and crop water requirement had decreased with time. The main reason for the decreasing of ETo and crop water requirements was the reducing of wind speed and sunshine hours.

78649348738	Predicting attachment efficiency of colloid deposition under unfavorable attachment conditions	This study presents an a priori model for predicting attachment efficiency of colloid deposition in porous media under unfavorable conditions. The model takes into account coupled effects of diffusion and hydrodynamic forces on colloid attachment efficiency that result from both primary and secondary minimum deposition. Effect of diffusion was quantified using the Maxwell approach, and influence of hydrodynamic drag was determined by comparing adhesive and hydrodynamic torques that act on the attached colloids. Main findings from this study include (1) the attachment efficiency does not change with increase of flow velocity until it reaches a critical value at which the attachment efficiency decreases as flow velocity further increases and (2) the attachment efficiency increases with increasing collector diameter when the condition that adhesive torque is greater than hydrodynamic torque is not guaranteed over the entire collector surface. Whereas the classic filtration theory only takes into account the effects of system hydrodynamics on single collector contact efficiency, we show additionally their effects on attachment efficiency. Furthermore, results of this study imply that in addition to the important role that collector size plays in the straining process, which has been the focus of many recent studies, it also influences the attachment process thus must be considered when describing colloid retention and transport in porous media under unfavorable attachment conditions.

78650445239	Research of soil conductivity measuring technique with TDR based on phase detecting principle	P-TDR is a new time-domain reflectometry based on the phase detection principle. It measures the travel time of testing signal by detecting phase difference of the incident and reflected waves, and thereby calculates the soil moisture content. The P-TDR measurement accuracy of soil moisture content reaches the level of the traditional TDR. But if it is used to measure soil conductivity (σ) by detecting the testing signal reflectivity (ρ), verification is necessary. The measurement method of soil conductivity and the principle of P-TDR were introduced firstly. Then an experiment was arranged. The testing signal reflectivity of P-TDR was measured in 8 sandy loam soil samples, which had different salt contents under five levels of soil moisture content (θ). The relationship between ρ and σ was modeled respectively by using linear and quadratic polynomial model, and the quadratic polynomial was chose for P-TDR electrical conductivity measurement model, whose determination coefficient was above 0.812. The experiment results also showed that soil moisture content had greater influence on the electrical conductivity measurement. After the analysis of the relationship between soil moisture and the quadratic polynomial coefficients, the predictive model of soil electrical conductivity, which is the function of ρ and θ, was established. The experiments of in-situ measurements are needed to research the influence of factors such as soil texture on the P-TDR soil conductivity measurement.

79651475128	Assessment of the influence of global dimming on the photosynthetic production of rice based on three-dimensional modeling	Observations indicate that global radiation reaching the Earth's surface has gradually decreased over the past several decades (i. e., the "global dimming" phenomenon), while the fraction of diffuse radiation in global radiation has increased. It has been found that the increase in diffuse fraction significantly increases photosynthetic production in the canopy, but the mechanism has not been clarified. A three-dimensional light distribution model considering the geometry of incident radiation was employed in this study. This model was used to simulate the light distribution and potential photosynthetic production of rice canopy. The results indicate that the potential photosynthetic production of rice significantly increases in response to an increase in the diffuse fraction as long as global radiation does not decline greatly. The "fertilization effect" of diffuse radiation results from the reduction of leaf area with photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) below the light compensation point in response to an increasing diffuse fraction, and an increase in the leaf area with PPFD on the linear part of the light response curve. The increase in the diffuse fraction results in a significant increase in the photosynthetic rate of the upper canopy. High-performance computation is an easy-to-use and economic approach to overcome the computational constraints of the model. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79954497251	Three-dimensional distribution of vessels, passage cells and lateral roots along the root axis of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum)	• Background and AimsThe capacity of a plant to absorb and transport water and nutrients depends on anatomical structures within the roots and their co-ordination. However, most descriptions of root anatomical structure are limited to 2-D cross-sections, providing little information on 3-D spatial relationships and hardly anything on their temporal evolution. Three-dimensional reconstruction and visualization of root anatomical structures can illustrate spatial co-ordination among cells and tissues and provide new insights and understanding of the interrelation between structure and function. • Methods Classical paraffin serial-section methods, image processing, computer-aided 3-D reconstruction and 3-D visualization techniques were combined to analyse spatial relationships among metaxylem vessels, passage cells and lateral roots in nodal roots of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum). • Key Results 3-D reconstruction demonstrated that metaxylem vessels were neither parallel, nor did they run directly along the root axis from the root base to the root tip; rather they underwent substitution and transition. Most vessels were connected to pre-existent or newly formed vessels by pits on their lateral walls. The spatial distributions of both passage cells and lateral roots exhibited similar position-dependent patterns. In the transverse plane, the passage cells occurred opposite the poles of the protoxylem and the lateral roots opposite those of the protophloem. Along the axis of a young root segment, the passage cells were arranged in short and discontinuous longitudinal files, thus as the tissues mature, the sequence in which the passage cells lose their transport function is not basipetal. In older segments, passage cells decreased drastically in number and coexisted with lateral roots. The spatial distribution of lateral roots was similar to that of the passage cells, mirroring their similar functions as lateral pathways for water and nutrient transport to the stele. • Conclusions With the 3-D reconstruction and visualization techniques developed here, the spatial relationships between vessels, passage cells and lateral roots and the temporal evolution of these relationships can be described. The technique helps to illustrate synchronization and spatial co-ordination among the roots radial and axial pathways for water and nutrient transport and the interdependence of structure and function in the root. © 2011 The Author Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Annals of Botany Company.

79954542321	A stochastic model of tree architecture and biomass partitioning: Application to Mongolian Scots pines	• Background and AimsMongolian Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) is one of the principal species used for windbreak and sand stabilization in arid and semi-arid areas in northern China. A model-assisted analysis of its canopy architectural development and functions is valuable for better understanding its behaviour and roles in fragile ecosystems. However, due to the intrinsic complexity and variability of trees, the parametric identification of such models is currently a major obstacle to their evaluation and their validation with respect to real data. The aim of this paper was to present the mathematical framework of a stochastic functionalstructural model (GL2) and its parameterization for Mongolian Scots pines, taking into account inter-plant variability in terms of topological development and biomass partitioning. • Methods In GL2, plant organogenesis is determined by the realization of random variables representing the behaviour of axillary or apical buds. The associated probabilities are calibrated for Mongolian Scots pines using experimental data including means and variances of the numbers of organs per plant in each order-based class. The functional part of the model relies on the principles of sourcesink regulation and is parameterized by direct observations of living trees and the inversion method using measured data for organ mass and dimensions. • Key ResultsThe final calibration accuracy satisfies both organogenetic and morphogenetic processes. Our hypothesis for the number of organs following a binomial distribution is found to be consistent with the real data. Based on the calibrated parameters, stochastic simulations of the growth of Mongolian Scots pines in plantations are generated by the Monte Carlo method, allowing analysis of the inter-individual variability of the number of organs and biomass partitioning. Three-dimensional (3D) architectures of young Mongolian Scots pines were simulated for 4-, 6- and 8-year-old trees. • Conclusions This work provides a new method for characterizing tree structures and biomass allocation that can be used to build a 3D virtual Mongolian Scots pine forest. The work paves the way for bridging the gap between a single-plant model and a stand model. © 2010 The Author Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Annals of Botany Company.

0036010067	Cryopreservation and xenotransplantation studies of microencapsulated rat pancreatic islets	Islets of Langerhans were isolated from the Sprague Dawley rat pancreas digested by injected collagenase, and purified by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. In order to make smaller and more uniform microencapsulated islets, we designed a special high-voltage electrostatic microcapsule generator. The effects of operational parameters of the generator on the size and the uniformity of microcapsules were analyzed, such as the voltage, the plunger speed of suspension delivery to the needle tip, the distance between needle tip and solution surface. The optimal parameter combinations for making microcapsules are: 5kV of voltage, 50mm/h of the plunger speed, and 20mm distance. The high-voltage electric system can produce uniform microcapsules with diameters ranging from 0.3∼0.5mm, which are smaller and more uniform than those produced by air-jet system. A comparison of the cryopreservation effects between microencapsulated islets and unencapsulated islets showed that the microcapsules can protect the fragile islets from freezing damage, and increase the retrieval rate from 68.5% to 92.6%. Xenotransplantation of the cryopreserved rat islets resulted in the normalization of the metabolic blood glucose of the diabetic mice for 90 days, whereas the unencapsulated islets were easily fragmented and lost during the freezing process. They only reversed hyperglycemia for less than 3-5 days.

79959844180	Spatial pattern analysis of heavy metals in Beijing agricultural soils based on spatial autocorrelation statistics	This study explored the spatial pattern of heavy metals in Beijing agricultural soils using Moran's I statistic of spatial autocorrelation. The global Moran's I result showed that the spatial dependence of Cr, Ni, Zn, and Hg changed with different spatial weight matrixes, and they had significant and positive global spatial correlations based on distance weight. The spatial dependence of the four metals was scale-dependent on distance, but these scale effects existed within a threshold distance of 13 km, 32 km, 50 km, and 29 km, respectively for Cr, Ni, Zn, and Hg. The maximal spatial positive correlation range was 57 km, 70 km, 57 km, and 55 km for Cr, Ni, Zn, and Hg, respectively and these were not affected by sampling density. Local spatial autocorrelation analysis detected the locations of spatial clusters and spatial outliers and revealed that the pollution of these four metals occurred in significant High-high spatial clusters, Low-high, or even High-low spatial outliers. Thus, three major areas were identified and should be receiving more attention: the first was the northeast region of Beijing, where Cr, Zn, Ni, and Hg had significant increases. The second was the southeast region of Beijing where wastewater irrigation had strongly changed the content of metals, particularly of Cr and Zn, in soils. The third area was the urban fringe around city, where Hg showed a significant increase. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The concept of effective bandwidth was presented to express the spatial variability of soil properties quantitatively. Frequency-domain method interpolation formula based on the theory of two-dimensional signal sampling and reconstruction was presented. A measurement of soil moisture sampling value in a wheat field under 20 m×20 m sampling grid was carried out, and the frequency-domain method was used to analyze the 15×15 soil moisture sampling value. The results show that the effective bandwidth of the wheat field equal to 0.01, it means that the spatial distribution of soil moisture is mainly composed of the frequency components in the period of more than 100 m. Then, re-sampling technique was employed in the original sampling data with changing sampling interval to 40 m×40 m and 60 m×60 m to extract two data sub-sets of 8×8 and 5×5. The sub-sets were used in frequency-domain interpolation and Kriging interpolation. Comparison of the soil moisture distribution profile and statistical characteristics of two interpolation method shows that the smoothing effect of Kriging method cover up some detail of the spatial variability, two methods are basically the same in interpolation accuracy, and frequency-domain method is better than Kriging method.

80052160692	Multifractal analyses of grayscale and binary soil thin section images	Multifractal analyses of binary images of soil thin sections (STS) are widely used to characterize pore structure. However, no geometrical model is known to exist for a binary multifractal. Thus, the multifractality of binary images, and the accuracy of multifractal parameters estimated from them, need to be carefully evaluated. We captured 8-bit depth resolution digital grayscale images of three STS images with dimensions of 1024 × 1024 pixels and a pixel length of 1.9 μm. Random grayscale geometrical multifractal fields (GMF) with similar dimensions and known multifractal parameters were constructed using generators extracted from the STS images. The STS and GMF grayscale images were objectively thresholded to give six binary images. The method of moments was used to compute the log-transformed partition function, log(χ(q, δ)) versus log(δ) where δ is box size, for each grayscale image and its binary counterpart. Consistent linearity was observed in the resulting functions for the grayscale images, indicating, by definition, multifractal behavior. In contrast, the log(χ(q, δ)) versus log(δ) plots for the binary images exhibited a two-region response, with a flat plateau at small scales and linearity at larger scales, indicating they were not true multifractals.

83155192490	Bound water content of air-dry soils measured by thermal analysis	Conventional oven-drying method may not give accurate information of bound water content in soils. The objective of this study was to determine the fraction of soil water that is bound to soil colloids using the thermogravimetry (TG) technique. A heating program from room temperature (RT) to 200°C was developed to partition bound water into loosely bound water (equivalent to water content determined by conventional oven-drying method) and tightly bound water that was not accounted by conventional oven-drying method on original and organic matter (OM) removed soil samples. Nine air-dry soils, with varying amounts of clay and OM contents, were tested. For the original air-dry samples, bound water content ranged from 0.54 to 5.22%, and the fractions of loosely and tightly bound water were about 80 and 20%, respectively. On a mass fraction basis, the specific water adsorption capacity of soil OM was 10 to 40 times that of soil minerals. For most mineral soils, however, the contribution of soil minerals to bound water (>70%) was much larger than that of soil OM (<30%), since the mineral fraction usually dominates over the OM fraction. In a soil with high OM concentration but a relatively low clay content, OM contribution to bound water exceeded 50%. Soil specific surface area (SA) showed a strong influence on bound water content, and a linear relationship between SA and bound water content was established. © Soil Science Society of America.

84859041835	Combining geostatistics with moran's i analysis for mapping soil heavy metals in Beijing, China	Production of high quality interpolation maps of heavy metals is important for risk assessment of environmental pollution. In this paper, the spatial correlation characteristics information obtained from Moran's I analysis was used to supplement the traditional geostatistics. According to Moran's I analysis, four characteristics distances were obtained and used as the active lag distance to calculate the semivariance. Validation of the optimality of semivariance demonstrated that using the two distances where the Moran's I and the standardized Moran's I, Z(I) reached a maximum as the active lag distance can improve the fitting accuracy of semivariance. Then, spatial interpolation was produced based on the two distances and their nested model. The comparative analysis of estimation accuracy and the measured and predicted pollution status showed that the method combining geostatistics with Moran's I analysis was better than traditional geostatistics. Thus, Moran's I analysis is a useful complement for geostatistics to improve the spatial interpolation accuracy of heavy metals. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84860390184	Surface roughness effect on deposition of Nano- and Micro-sized colloids in saturated columns at different solution ionic strengths	In this study we conducted experiments with saturated columns packed with sand and glass beads to quantitatively examine surface roughness effect on deposition and release of micro- and nano-sized colloids at different solution ionic strengths. Experimental results showed more colloid retentions in both primary and secondary energy minima in sand than in glass bead columns, especially at high solution ionic strengths (e.g., >0.01 M). This observation cannot be explained by the classic Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, which assumes sphere-smooth surface configuration. We modified the Derjaguin approximation approach and calculated interaction energies, which indicate that the sharp asperities on sand surfaces can facilitate colloid deposition in primary minima by reducing the energy barrier. In addition, the increased att achment in secondary minima in sand columns can be att ributed to the presence of the valleys on sand surfaces where colloids associated at secondary minima can be shielded from hydrodynamic shear. Additional theoretical analysis verified that large valleys can locally increase the energy barrier as well as the secondary-minimum depth, and hence, are favorable for colloid deposition in secondary minima. Whereas the reduction effects of surface roughness on energy barrier has been extensively addressed in the literature, our modified DLVO analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the effect of this mechanism is only effective at high ionic strength for large colloids (e.g., >0.01 M for the 1156 nm colloid in this study). We provide experimental evidence and theoretical demonstration that surface roughness also plays an important role in colloid deposition at secondary minima under unfavorable conditions. Our study provides a more complete understanding of the effect of surface roughness on colloid deposition. © Soil Science Society of America.

84862664077	Spatial distribution of China grain output based on land use and population density	Applying statistics in geo-ecological process researches is an important manifestation of the combination of human activities and the geo-ecological process. Spatialization of agricultural statistics is a means to restore and reconstruct the spatial features of agricultural statistics. The resulting raster maps can provide data support for a wide range of geo-ecological studies. In support of land use, a regression model was constructed by taking population density as the dependent variable and grain yield per unit of arable land as independent one. The model was then applied to spatially distribute provincial-level grain output statistics, resulting in a 1 km × 1 km grid for China's grain output in 2000. The validation of the resulting maps by using grain output statistics at provincial, municipal and county administrative units showed that the method can correctly map the spatial distribution of grain output, especially for the major grain producing areas, with a high accuracy of the data reproduction. The results can be used as a data source for geo-ecological studies in agricultural areas. The accuracy of gridded grain output was observed to decline with the downscaling of the administrative region. The paper concluded that a higher accuracy grid would be generated if more ancillary factors associated with grain outputs were incorporated.

84862882423	Estimation of soil water content of internal different layers using ground-penetrating radar signals	Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has been used to estimate the surface soil water content rapidly and no-invasively. However, the research on soil water content of internal different layers using GPR has seldom been reported. So we used the GPR with a 500-MHz antenna to carry out the relevant study in bare soil with 100 cm depth. Firstly, the reflectors made in 10-cm diameter steel pipe were embedded in different soil layer with 10-cm interval in experimental area, and then the survey lines were arranged, and then, experimental area was scanned by GPR along the different survey lines. Finally, on the experimental area the soil water contents were obtained by the gravimetric method with a stratified sampling for two kind of soil water content. One kind is measuring the soil water from soil surface to a certain soil depth, the other kind is measuring the water content of soil with a certain thickness which has a distance from the soil surface. In the same experimental area the preceding trials (including GPR survey and measured soil water with gravimetric) were done again after six days. After all the experiments, the wave velocities of the GPS to different depth were calibrated, and soil dielectric permittivity was calculated using the physical theory. Based soil dielectric permittivity, internal different layer soil water contents, and the average soil water contents from the soil surface to a certain soil depth obtained by the gravimetric method obtained in the first experiment data, the model for estimating the internal different layer soil water content using signals of GPR was developed. And then, the model was validated by the second experimental data. The max relative error between estimated value and measured value of soil volumetric water content was 10.29%. The results showed that the method in our research can use signals of GPR to estimate the internal different layer soil water contents quickly and accurately. Last we discussed the possible reasons on error and potential application of this study. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

Based on the dynamics topological structure, the partitioning of the biomass available of root system from the plant was performed according to the sink and expanding rate of each UR. The parameters of the model were calculated or set by the literature data. Finally, we used the model to simulate the processes of development and growth for two kinds of typical root system including fibrous root system and taproot root system.

84863229420	Role of surface roughness in chemical detachment of colloids deposited at primary energy minima	This study theoretically and experimentally examined effects of surface roughness on detachment of colloids deposited under favorable chemical conditions on reduction of solution ionic strength. A superposition approach based on elemental geometric models was developed to estimate variation of Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interac tion energies between a colloid and a rough surface under different solution chemistries. Theoretical analysis showed that most colloids atiached at rough surfaces via primaryminimum association are irreversible on reduction of solution ionic strength because primary minima are deeper and the detachment energy barriers are greater at lower ionic strength. A fraction of colloids initially atiached at tips of nanoscale protruding asperities, however, will detach from a rough surface at low ionic strength because the net force acting on the colloids can become repulsive (i.e., calculated DLVO interaction energy curves show monotonic decreases of interaction energies with separation distance at low ionic strength). Column experiments were conducted with 1156-nm polystyrene latex particles and rough sand (300-355-μm diameter) to examine the detachment of colloids initially deposited at primary minima. Experimental results confirmed that a fraction of colloids are released at low ionic strengths. Our theoretical and experimental results are consistent with literature observations, adding convincing evidence to challenge the usual belief that colloids atiached at primary minima are irreversible on reduction of solution ionic strength. Although the importance of surface heterogeneity on colloid deposition has been widely recognized, our study implies that surface heterogeneity also plays a critical role in colloid detachment under both favorable and unfavorable conditions. © Soil Science Society of America, All rights reserved.

The objective of this study is to examine if the probe body and the thermal contact conductivity (H) lead to biased estimation of the thermal properties by using the DP method.

84865192355	A functional and structural Mongolian Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) model integrating architecture, biomass and effects of precipitation	Mongolian Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) is one of the principal tree species in the network of Three-North Shelterbelt for windbreak and sand stabilisation in China. The functions of shelterbelts are highly correlated with the architecture and eco-physiological processes of individual tree. Thus, model-assisted analysis of canopy architecture and function dynamic in Mongolian Scots pine is of value for better understanding its role and behaviour within shelterbelt ecosystems in these arid and semiarid regions. We present here a single-tree functional and structural model, derived from the GreenLab model, which is adapted for young Mongolian Scots pines by incorporation of plant biomass production, allocation, allometric rules and soil water dynamics. The model is calibrated and validated based on experimental measurements taken on Mongolian Scots pines in 2007 and 2006 under local meteorological conditions. Measurements include plant biomass, topology and geometry, as well as soil attributes and standard meteorological data. After calibration, the model allows reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) canopy architecture and biomass dynamics for trees from one- to six-year-old at the same site using meteorological data for the six years from 2001 to 2006. Sensitivity analysis indicates that rainfall variation has more influence on biomass increment than on architecture, and the internode and needle compartments and the aboveground biomass respond linearly to increases in precipitation. Sensitivity analysis also shows that the balance between internode and needle growth varies only slightly within the range of precipitations considered here. The model is expected to be used to investigate the growth of Mongolian Scots pines in other regions with different soils and climates. © 2012 Wang et al.

84864392565	Theoretical and experimental investigation of detachment of colloids from rough collector surfaces	This study systematically examined coupled influence of particle size and surface roughness on colloid detachment during transients in solution chemistry. A modified Derjaguin approach was utilized to three-dimensional which determined the variation of Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interaction energies in detachment processes for elemental models of a rough surface: a hemisphere on a flat surface or two hemispheres against each other on a flat surface. Theoretical results show that the nano-scale protruding asperities on surfaces play a critical role in detachment of colloids from primary minima upon reduction of solution ionic strength. Critical electrolyte concentrations exist for detachment of colloids from primary minima and they are lower for detachment of larger colloids. Critical electrolyte concentrations disappear if cation exchange is present. The reduction of secondary minima by surface roughness assists detachment of micro-sized colloids at high ionic strengths (e.g., ≥0.1. M in this study). Spontaneous detachments from secondary minimum occur for micro-sized colloids attached at low ionic strengths (e.g., ≤0.01. M) and for nanoparticles attached under unfavorable conditions. The theoretical results of this study are supported by the observations in our experiments and provide plausible explanations for the reported detachment behaviors in literature. Whereas the fact that surface roughness reduces energy barrier and accordingly increases attachment in primary minima has been widely recognized in the literature, our study shows that surface roughness also favors attachment in secondary minima and detachment from both primary and secondary minima. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84865815868	Evaluation of the APSIM-Wheat model in terms of different cultivars, management regimes and environmental conditions	Wheat is one of the most important crops in the world, and wheat models have been widely used to study yield responses to changes in management and climate. However, less information is available on how a wheat model performs in simulation of wheat response to changes in varieties, sowing dates and planting densities across space. This study presents an evaluation of the APSIMWheat model using data from field experiments consisting of three sowing dates, two and three crop varieties and three planting densities in a split-split plot design at three ecological sites from 2008 to 2010 in the North China Plain. The results show that the APSIM-Wheat model could capture a large part of the variation in phenology, biomass and yield for the same variety across sites. However, errors of simulation in phenology and yield were increased with delay in sowing date, with the average absolute root mean square errors of 2 d, 3 d, and 3-4 d in phenology, and the normalized root mean square error (RMSEn) of 7-12 %, 11-16 %, 16-22 % in yield at early, medium, and late sowing dates, respectively. Simulation of yield achieved poor results with decreased planting density, with average RMSEn of 9-12 %, 11-12 %, and 16-19 % at high, medium, and low density, respectively. Additionally, the simulation behaved in a complex manner, and the errors varied greatly with different combinations of sowing dates and planting densities. These alerted us that the model should be used cautiously to simulate growth and yield over a wide range of sowing dates and planting densities. Improved modeling of the responses of wheat growth to extreme temperatures during winter and spring periods, and to varying planting densities is needed for better future prediction. Other areas of model improvements are also discussed.

Implementation of the project on local grain production and the resulting policy effect is a problem worthy of study. This paper analyzed temporal and spatial variation of grain production in the eco-fragile area of the Loess Plateau of China before and after the implementation of the Grain for Green Project using county-level statistics in 1996, 2003 and 2007. The results showed that from 1996 to 2003, the sown area of grain of the study area declined sharply, and then began to rise gradually. Downward trends of grain sown area had been checked for most counties until 2007. From 1996 to 2007, the study area's total grain output declined, but the level of grain yield per unit area increased. The grain yield per unit area of the study area was far lower than the national average, while per capita grain production in the study area was slightly lower than the national average, but both showed great inter-annual fluctuations. The lower the level of grain production, the greater the inter-annual fluctuations could be observed. Unstable grain production will strengthen the farmers' motivation, which goes against the consolidation of the results of Grain fro Green. Grain for Green project should be implemented step by step according to the local condition with an appropriate scale in study area. Further more, the livelihood of farmers should be conducted and protected in terms of policy to consolidate the project effects.

84867528884	Application of DLVO energy map to evaluate interactions between spherical colloids and rough surfaces	This study theoretically evaluated interactions between spherical colloids and rough surfaces in three-dimensional space using Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey- Overbeek (DLVO) energy/force map and curve. The rough surfaces were modeled as a flat surface covered by hemispherical protrusions. A modified Derjaguin approach was employed to calculate the interaction energies and forces. Results show that more irreversible attachments in primary minima occur at higher ionic strengths, which theoretically explains the observed hysteresis of colloid attachment and detachment during transients in solution chemistry. Secondary minimum depths can be increased significantly in concave regions (e.g., areas aside of asperities or between asperities) due to sidewall interactions. Through comparing the tangential attractive forces from asperities and the hydrodynamic drag forces in three-dimensional space, we showed that attachment in secondary minima can be located on open collector surfaces of a porous medium. This result challenges the usual belief that the attachment in secondary minima only occurs in stagnation point regions of the porous medium and is absent in shear flow systems such as parallel plate flow chamber and impinging jet apparatus. Despite the argument about the role of secondary minima in colloid attachment remained, our study theoretically justified the existence of attachment in secondary minima in the presence of surface roughness. Further, our study implied that the presence of surface roughness is more favorable for attachment in secondary minima than in primary minima under unfavorable chemical conditions. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84878615875	Influence of surface chemical heterogeneity on attachment and detachment of microparticles	This study theoretically examined attachment/detachment of negatively charged microparticles onto/from a negative planar surface carrying a positively charged square patch of different sizes. The surface element integration technique was used to calculate Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interaction energies at different ionic strengths. Results show that a critical patch size is needed to attach a particle at a given ionic strength. The critical size decreases with increasing ionic strength and decreasing particle size. Colloid attachment on the patch via primary-minimum association is irreversible to reduction of ionic strength, in contrast to the experimental observations in the literature. We attributed the discrepancy to the fact that chemical heterogeneity is commonly accompanied with topographical variation. To account for the coupled effects on colloid detachment, the collector surface was modeled as a negative planar surface carrying a square prism. If the size of the prism is ≤5. nm × 5. nm × 5. nm, whether the prism surface is positively or negatively charged does not have significant influence on the interaction energy curves at ≤0.01. M. These tiny asperities mainly play a role in eliminating the primary minima of interaction energy curves at the low ionic strengths, causing detachment of colloids from primary minima. For larger prisms, the primary-minimum depths can be increased significantly if the prism surfaces are positively charged, resulting in more irreversible attachments in primary minima. Findings from this study have implications to understanding particle-surface interactions that involve only one ligand-receptor bond (e.g., cell-biomaterial interactions via a single contact). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84878731282	Maize kernel growth at different floret positions of the ear	The variation of individual kernel weight can have a large impact on final yield of maize (Zea mays L.). The goal of this research was to investigate the variation of maize kernel dry weight (KW) along the rachis of the ear and to determine the effect of kernel growth parameters on this variation. Field experiments were conducted for three years using two hybrids with contrasting plant densities. The fresh and dry weights of each kernel from one row of the ear were measured. Kernel growth at the basal, upper and apical sections of the ear was compared with that at the lower third section. The KW distribution in one row was the highest for the lower third section, followed by the basal and upper sections and the lowest for the apical section. The relative decrease in final KW of the other sections relative to the lower third section was determined by both the decrease in rate and duration of linear grain-filling for the normal density treatments, and was only determined by the decrease in growth rate for the low density treatments. The distribution of kernel water mass in one row showed the same trend as KW. However, the developments of kernel moisture content among sections were quite similar. The relative change in final KW of the other sections relative to the lower third section was closely correlated with the relative change in kernel maximum water mass (R

84879637030	Evaluating the contribution of complementary radiation on photosynthesis of maize canopy with 3D radiative transfer model	Photosynthesis of a canopy is primarily determined by its interception of solar radiation. Previous studies used to ignore the effects of complementary radiation (radiation scattered by canopy components) by taking leaf as black body in calculating the interception of photosynthetic active radiation. However, some recent researches suggested that complementary radiation may raise light utilization efficiency of plant canopy and its influence on photosynthesis cannot be ignored. In this study, Parallel Monte Carlo ray tracing model for three-dimensional canopy was employed to simulate the process of radiative transfer within maize canopies for quantifying the complementary radiation from leaves and its contribution to canopy photosynthetic production. It is suggested that scattering radiation can play a significant role in the middle and lower layers of a dense maize canopy and its contribution to light interception and photosynthetic production in a canopy is dependent on the solar elevation and canopy structure parameters such as leaf area index and leaf area density. © 2012 IEEE.

84883611311	Facilitated attachment of nanoparticles at primary minima by nanoscale roughness is susceptible to hydrodynamic drag under unfavorable chemical conditions	This study investigated effects of flow velocity on attachment of nanoparticles at primary minima in the presence of surface roughness under unfavorable chemical conditions. Saturated sand-packed column experiments were conducted at 0.1 and 0.2. M NaCl using 30. nm polystyrene latex nanoparticles as model colloids. Particle attachment at primary minima was unambiguously determined by removing particles attached at secondary minima through introducing deionized water and excavating the packed beds. The calculated primary-minimum attachment efficiency was found to decrease with increasing flow velocity, indicating that the fraction of a collector surface that is available for attachment at primary minima decreases with increasing flow velocity. The torque analysis, however, showed that the adhesive torque that the particle experiences at primary minima is much larger than the maximum hydrodynamic drags of a porous medium for the flow velocities used. We attributed the discrepancy to the reason that the sand surface is very rough and the roughness mainly causes the attachment in primary minima under the experimental conditions used in this study. By considering influence of surface roughness in the torque analysis, our calculations show that while particle attachment in primary minima is favored atop of nanoasperities under unfavorable conditions, the adhesive torque that the particle experiences can be greatly reduced and, thus, the attachment is susceptible to flow drag. Whereas the increase of adhesive torque by surface roughness has been widely recognized in the literature, our study indicates that the rough asperities can also decrease adhesive torques for particles attached atop of them. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Other methods were also used in conjunction with microscopy to examine the transport at pore scale. Mathematical models based on convection-dispersion equation were developed to simulate bacterial transport. Within specific limits, these models could simulate the major behaviors of bacterial transport. However, they neglected some parameters such as the growth and death of bacteria. The theoretical development, experimental size, scale exchange and modeling for predicting bacterial transport at field scale should be further studied.

84889262687	Investigating contribution factors to China's grain output increase in period of 2003 to 2011	China's grain output has continued to increase since 2003. Identifying contributing and driving factors and quantifying their contribution rates to the increase of grain output (IGO) will help to make a correct agriculture policy to maintain or improve the grain production capacity. Using the statistics of outputs, sown areas, and yield (output of per unit sown area) of grain production and its composition crops (i.e. rice, maize, wheat, soybeans, tubers, and minor cereals according to National Bureau of Statistics of China), this paper analyzed the contributors and their contribution rates to IGO from crops and regional aspects. Furthermore, an algorithm was constructed to divide driving factors into sown area, yield, and adjustment of grain structure. The driving types of IGO were delineated according to the contribution rate of sown areas and yield for regions and crops. The results showed that the IGO were all from rice, wheat, and maize, which were considered as high yield crops compared to other grain crops. The largest crop contributor was maize, with a contribution rate of more than 50%. The output of minor cereals, soybeans, and tubers all declined during the period of 2003-2011, with the reduction rate of 25.7%, 17.4%, and 8.2% on sown areas for minor cereals, soybeans, and tubers respectively. Heilongjiang and Henan were the largest region contributors, whose cumulative contribution rate reached up to 35%. The top 13 provinces with the cumulative contribution rate more than 90% were mostly the major grain-producing provinces, except for Xinjiang. As a traditional major grain producing province, the contribution rate of IGO in Sichuan was just 1.6%. This value was roughly in line with the values of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu, which were all non-major grain producing provinces. At the national scale, the sown area of grain was the strongest driving factor, with a contribution rate of 46.3%, followed by yield, contributing 44.2% to IGO. Adjustment of grain structure contributed the remaining 9.5%, more than half of it coming from conversion of sown areas from soybeans to maize and rice. With respect to crops, the IGO in rice, maize, and spring wheat were mainly driven by the sown areas. The driving factors of the IGO in winter wheat were sown areas and yield, with yield slightly larger than sown area. At the regional scale, the sown area was the dominant factor to drive IGO in most of the main contribution provinces. Yield per unit sown area became the major driving factor only in Henan and Anhui. The contribution of sown area and yield were almost equal in Jilin and Hebei. Overall, China's IGO in the period of 2003-2011 belonged to the type of sown-area dominance. Henceforth, the potential of sown areas adjustment from low-yield crops to high-yield crops is limited by the consumption patterns of grains and the capacity of the international trade in grain. Therefore, in addition to stabilizing the sown areas of grain crops, improving grain yield is another important strategy to further stabilize and increase grain production capacity. The results will be able to provide a decision-making basis for China's agricultural policy adjustments.

84892443270	Modeling of water and nitrogen utilization of layered soil profiles under a wheat-maize cropping system	Understanding water and nutrient utilization in agricultural layered soil is very important for the improvement of agricultural management and protection of the environment. The objective of this paper is to determine the effect of layered soil profiles on crop yield and water and fertilizer nitrogen (N) utilization. Firstly a water and nitrogen management model (WNMM) was calibrated and validated under a wheat-maize cropping system in an alluvial plain using published data of two soil profiles (named A and B). The results showed that the model can be used to simulate the water movement and N transport, as well as crop growth in the study area. Then, another three very different soil profiles (named C, D and E) near to profiles A and B were studied. The profile C had a silt loam-clay profile; the profile D had a silty loam-clay-silt profile and the profile E had a clay-silty loam-silt profile. The soil hydraulic parameters of these profiles were obtained by pedo-transfer functions using measured soil properties. Given the same initial conditions and field management practices, the WNMM was then used to simulate water and Nitrogen balance and crop yield for the three profiles. Simulated results showed that the profiles (C, D and E) have similar water and fertilizer N use efficiencies (WUE, FNUE), while the crop yields of profiles C and D were higher than that of the profile E.

A new solution of the problem was put forward. An integrated linear weighted drought monitoring index (IMDI) was suggested, which is incorporated with remote sensing index (TVDI) constructed by EOS/MODIS data and meteorological factor, named percent of precipitation departure (PPAI). Two periods had been selected to monitor drought in Wuling Mountain area including mid-and the late April in 2011. By comparing with soil moisture in 10cm depth from the observatories around the same area in 2010 and 2011, together with contrasting the correlations with SPI, IMDI and TVDI were confirmed to be able to monitor drought distribution in such a large and complicated area and IMDI is superior to TVDI. However, drought monitored by SPI may be more serious than that of actual situation.

84893335445	Estimation of soil clay content using hygroscopic water content at an arbitrary humidity	Clay content has a significant influence on soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. The objectives of this study are to develop a linear model that predicts clay content of soils dominated by 2:1 minerals from easily measured hygroscopic water content (q) at an arbitrary relative humidity (RH), and to compare the performance of the new model versus two previous models: the Resurreccion model (R model) and the Schneider- Goss model (SG model). The new linear model (New model) was established by integrating with the Campbell and Shiozawa model and the Kelvin equation. A total of 114 soil samples were collected from 14 soil profiles (0 to 2 m) near Tai'an city of China. Soil clay content (fCL) and q at three different RHs (21, 45, and 60%) were measured and used to validate the New model, separately. The q values varied from 0.23 to 4.86%, and fCL ranged from 2.84 to 37.3%. The results showed that the values predicted by the New model agreed well with measured data. The further comparison using measured and literature data indicated that the root mean squared errors (RMSE) of the New model, the R model, and the SG model were in the ranges of 2.3 to 6.6%, 3.1 to 8.8% and 4.4 to 9.2%, respectively, with the New model having the least prediction error. The New model will provide a useful method to estimate clay content of soils dominated by 2:1 minerals using q at an arbitrary RH. © Soil Science Society of America.

84894030072	Heteroaggregation of microparticles with nanoparticles changes the chemical reversibility of the microparticles' attachment to planar surfaces	This study theoretically investigated detachment of homoaggregates and heteroaggregates attached on the planar surfaces at primary minima during transients in solution chemistry. The homoaggregates were represented as small colloidal clusters with well-defined structures or as clusters generated by randomly packing spheres using Monte Carlo method. The heteroaggregates were modeled as microparticles coated with nanoparticles. Surface element integration technique was adopted to calculate Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interaction energies for the homoaggregates and heteroaggregates at different ionic strengths. Results show that attached homoaggregates on the planar surface at primary minima are irreversible to reduction in solution ionic strength whether the primary spheres of the homoaggregates are nano- or micro-sized. Heteroaggregation of nanoparticles with a microparticle can cause DLVO interaction energy to decrease monotonically with separation distance at low ionic strengths (e.g., ≤0.01. M), indicating that the heteroaggregates experience repulsive forces at all separation distances. Therefore, attachment of the heteroaggregates at primary minima can be detached upon reduction in ionic strength. Additionally, we showed that the adhesive forces and torques that the aforementioned heteroaggregates experience can be significantly smaller than those experienced by the microspheres without attaching nanoparticles, thus, the heteroaggregates are readily detached via hydrodynamic drag. Results of study provide plausible explanation for the observations in the literature that attached/aggregated particles can be detached/redispersed from primary minima upon reduction in ionic strength, which challenges the common belief that attachment/aggregation of particles in primary minima is chemically irreversible. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84894048046	Analysis of elevation discrepancies along the Lop Nur ear-shaped stripes observed using GLAS and DGPS data	The Lop Nur is a dried-up salt lake lying in the eastern part of the Tarim Basin in China. The peculiar ear-shaped stripes in Lop Nur observed in satellite images have attracted the interest of investigators. It is believed that these stripes represent former lake shorelines, thus are valuable for studying the lake evolution. Owing to insufficient high-precision elevation data, the elevation along a given stripe was supposed to be constant. In this study, elevation data collected by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) and the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) were carefully analysed. The combined topographic data for the ear-shaped region indicate that the elevations of the south shorelines are approximately 1 m higher than the north shorelines along the same stripe. We analyse the mechanisms of the phenomenon and suggest that the wind-driven water surface tilt at the time the ear-shaped stripes formed is the dominant one. The stripe profiles simulated by this mechanism show an excellent agreement with the measured stripe profiles. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

The results showed that sand column obviously increased the transport efficiency of water and salt, which may attribute to the higher hydraulic conductivity and higher diffusion coefficients in sand columns than clay-loam coastal saline. The efficiency of sand column depends on its position and its angle accordingly. The slanted columns were overall superior to the vertical ones in transport efficiency.

0347029965	Biological drainage characteristics of alakalized desert soils in north-western China	Years of intensive irrigated farming in the Oasis area of Xinjiang in north-western China has caused secondary salinization of vast areas of land since the mid 1980s. Soil salinity/ sodicity surveys in the area, conducted after the problem surfaced, showed relatively high levels of the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) in the upper soil layers. In one study, 92% of cored soil samples of the affected fields showed SAR values above 5, while 42% had values above 15. One ameliorative approach, bio-drainage using different desert vegetations, was used to control the high water-tables and reverse the observed salinity/sodicity trends in the border area of the Manas Alluvial Fan. The ground-water table dropped to below 2.28 m in the summer of the fifth year, which was sufficient to prevent secondary salinization. A related plot study showed that Lycium barbarum and Puccinellia Chinamponsis consumed large amounts of soil water while leaving most of the salts behind. The salt contents of leaves and young branches were different for different vegetation. Soil profile salt distributions for the deep-rooted and shallow-rooted systems were different in two of the three years after planting. Commercial forestry of L. barbarum and other timber products under current conditions, and without irrigation, appears a viable agricultural alternative that could bring higher returns than for wheat or cotton. Results of this study indicate that both conventional and biological drainage are attractive options for controlling the local hydrology and limiting or diminishing salinity-sodicity trends. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The objective of this study was to develop a water and N management model for intensive cropping systems and agricultural management practices in NCP. Based on the previous research findings, a coupled model (Soil Water Heat Carbon and Nitrogen Simulation, WHCNS) model was established. The model included 5 main modules: soil water, soil heat, soil C, soil N, and crop growth. The Penman-Montheith method from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation was used to calculate the reference crop evapotranspiration. The method for simulating soil water movement and heat transfer was directly introduced from the HYDRUS1D and RZWQM models. The PS123 model from the Netherlands was used to simulate crop growth. The simulation of C and N cycles was done by the Daisy model from Denmark. The model ran on a daily time step and was driven by the meteorological and crop biological variables, and agricultural management practices. The soil water infiltration and redistribution processes were described by Green-Ampt and Richard's equations, respectively. Soil N transport simulation was based on the modified convection-dispersion equation. The source-sink term of N transformation and transport included mineralization of soil organic N, immobilization in biomass, urea hydrolysis, ammonia volatilization, nitrification, denitrification, and crop uptake. The compensatory absorption mechanism was introduced in crop water and N uptake. The organic matter pools were divided into 3 active and 3 stabile C pools. The improved version of the PS123 model was applied to simulate crop development stage, dry matter production and allocation, and crop yield. The crop yield under water and N stress was calculated based on the simulation of potential and actual crop water and N uptake. Then the field applicability of the WHCNS model was tested using the two-year field observed data of winter wheat and summer maize system at Tai'an experimental site in Shandong province. The statistical indices (root mean square error, modeling efficiency, and agreement index) all indicated that the simulated values of crop yield, leaf area index, soil water content, and nitrate concentration in the soil profile all agreed reasonably well with the observed values, especially for crop yields with the root mean square error ranges from 205.5 to 318.8 kg/hm

84921495479	Soil salinity dynamic change and desalting effect under different improvement measures in severe salinity soil in Xinjiang	Soil salinization can directly affect crop production, and threaten the sustainable utilization of irrigated land. This problem is particularly prominent in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where has much uncultivated arable land, and soil saline and secondary salinization after land development. In this study, field experiments were conducted to investigate the influence factors and characteristics of soil salt movement, as well as elution desalination in different improvement measures treatments of severe saline soil through 3-year experiment. Five improvement treatments were designed including agricultural improvement (mainly including mulched with plastic film, deep plowing, returning straw and organic fertilizer), salt-isolation to root zone plus agricultural improvement, subsurface pipe drainage plus agricultural improvement, chemical modified plus agricultural improvement, and control without any human activity on new reclamation farmland in Xinjiang Province. The results indicated that salt content of the soil was mainly affected by evaporation, irrigation amount and groundwater depth; the soil salt content was significantly negative correlated with irrigation amount (correlation coefficient=-0.871, P=0.0039) and groundwater depth (correlation coefficient=-0.831, P=0.0072), positively correlated with monthly evaporation (correlation coefficient=0.754, P=0.0084), but not significantly correlated with mean monthly temperatures; The effect of irrigation amount on the 0-80 cm soil salinity in entire growth period was the most prominent. In the 3-years, dynamic changes in soil saline content varied with different improvement methods: high salt content accumulated in the top and deep layers of soil throughout the growing period for agricultural improvement treatment; obvious salt accumulation in the top layer of soils for salt-isolation to root zone plus agricultural improvement; the salt content at the deep layer higher than in subsurface layer for pipe drainage plus agricultural improvement, and chemical modified plus agricultural improvement treatment. The desalination rate of soils after the first-year was not satisfactory, and that after the second-year was significantly improved. The desalination rate of soil in the treatment of salt-isolation to root zone plus agricultural improvement and subsurface pipe drainage plus agricultural improvement treatment was up to 44% in the second year, but was significantly decreased in the third-year due to the reduction of the total salt content of the soil. Overall, all the treatments could result in the decrease of soil salt content. Among them, the soil desalinization rates of agricultural improvement plus subsurface pipe drainage and salt-isolation to root zone plus agricultural improvement were 61.33% and 59.37% respectively in the 0 to 80 cm layers, which were better than the other treatment. The soil desalinization rate of chemical modified plus agricultural improvement treatment was 55.32% in the 0 to 40 cm layers, higher than agricultural improvement 45.42%. The results can provide valuble information for saline soil improvement and rational development and effective utilization of saline soils in the Xinjiang arid zone.
