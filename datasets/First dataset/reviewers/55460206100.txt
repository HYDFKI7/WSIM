3242730974	Superplastic diffusion bonding of γ-TiAl-based alloy	With laser surface melting and conventional heat treatment, superplastic diffusion bonding of TiAl alloy samples was carried out. Three different microstructure, i.e. fully lamellar structure, fine dendritic structure and refined equiaxed structure are used and their effects on bonding quality were investigated, and the bond quality was assessed by shear test at room temperature. Sound bonds could be achieved at 900 °C by laser surface modification or by laser surface modification and pre-bond heat treatment at 1000 °C for 60 min, which is lower than conventional diffusion bonding temperature. The bonds were also post-bond heat treated at 1200 °C for 30 min, which improved the bond quality in all cases. The best shear strength of the bonds is greater than 80% of that of base metal. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

34249332063	Volume defect fatigue failure of ceramic balls under rolling condition	A newly developed pure rolling fatigue test rig with three contact points is used to test the rolling contact fatigue properties of silicon nitride ceramic balls. Ball surfaces are examined after failure with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The failure cause, fatigue phenomenon and mechanics are analyzed. The research shows that subsurface cracks play a dominant role in the formation of spalling failure. These cracks originated from volume defects of the material and propagate, to form elliptical fatigue spalls under the action of principal tensile stresses. The principal tensile stress increases with increasing contact load, causing spall formation and reduction of rolling contact life. The greater the principal tensile stress is, the more severe the peeling of near surface is. Under the same condition, the closer volume defects are to the surface, the more likely failure occurs, the shorter the rolling contact life is.

34548311872	Critical stress of silicon nitride ceramic balls under pure rolling condition	The rolling contact fatigue life and wear life of Silicon nitride ceramic balls are determined by critical stress in a way. For a ceramic material ball under the passage of a contact load, the critical stress is assumed to be the maximum principal tensile stress because of its lower tensile strength. Contact stress field in subsurface was analyzed using elastic contact mechanics and Hertz theory under pure rolling condition. Maximum principal tensile is obtained. The pure rolling contact fatigue test was performed correspondent to theory calculation. It is shown by analysis that theory values are generally consistent with test result. Consequently it is verified that critical stress of Silicon nitride ceramic balls is the maximum principal tensile stress. Theory foundation may be provided by calculation results to analyze the rolling contact fatigue life of ceramic balls.

34547410998	Quantitative relationship between impact property and dynamic compressive performance of Ti alloy	To explore the relationship between impact property and cold upsetting finished product ratio of Ti alloy, the effect of microstructure parameter on impact property of Ti-3Al-5Mo-4.5V alloy was investigated systemically with quantitative statistical analysis method. The relationship among crack initiation energy, crack propagation energy, total impact energy and the width of shear band was analyzed combined with the variety of the width of shear band after dynamic compressive deformation. The result shows as follows. First, as anneal temperature rises, α platelet ratio (length/width) increases first and then decreases, crack initiation energy ascends first and then descends, while crack propagation energy diminishes first and then increases, and total impact energy ascends persistently. Second, there is no certain relationship between total impact energy and dynamic compressive performance; crack initiation energy is in inverse proportion to the width of shear band, while there is a positive correlation between the crack propagation energy and the width of shear band linearly.

40949122070	Tensile stress life model for rolling contact fatigue of silicon nitride ceramic balls	The relation expression between failure probability and rolling contact fatigue life is deduced with WEIBULL fracture statistic method for the silicon nitride ceramic ball in ball-cylinder geometric model. The tensile stress life model about silicon nitride ceramic balls is set up between rolling contact fatigue life and contact stress on the basis of the correlative numerical solution between the rating life and the maximum contact stress. The tensile stress life model is conceived basing on maximum principal tensile stress. It is indicated that the tensile stress life model is feasible through rolling contact fatigue test with different stress level. It is verified by the tensile stress life model that silicon nitride ceramic balls failed by the maximum principal tensile stress, not by the maximum shear stress. In comparison with the L-P shear stress life model, the tensile stress life model is reasonable for rolling contact fatigue life prediction of silicon nitride ceramic balls.

58849103938	Finite element analysis of thrust bearing magnetic field in 22KW spindle	There is a magnetic field inside thrust bearing. The magnetic field distribution is one of the key factors which decide the running state and performance. With the finite element of ANSYS software, the magnetic field of thrust bearing has been analyzed. The rule of changes between the magnetic field and the influencing factors has been discovered. The analysis shows that the direction of exciting current should be opposite other than identical. The greater the ratio of gap length between stator and rotor and working gap length is, the less magnetic field leakage is. The flux leakage of thrust bearing attains 37 percent when the ratio of the gap is 4.0. If the design of a complete machine is not proper, the flux leakage may attain 20 percent upwards through other gaps although that of the bearing itself is almost zero. Calculation of bearing capacity indicates that theoretical value is not exact due to its neglect of magnetic saturation and flux leakage, while FEM value comparably matches the real substance with considering the magnetic saturation and flux leakage. The research provides the theoretical basis for optimization of system structure and selection of current direction control.

If the bootstrap is not secure, Rootkits, Viruses and Trojan horses may be loaded into kernel, thus the following defenses built on the compromised kernel may be useless. In this paper, a trusted-computing based security bootstrap is introduced.

Comparing against existing works, our contributions are as follows: (1) Our approach can automatically recover programs being attacked. Furthermore, the "attack codes" inserted by attackers can be extracted and their corresponding physical addresses can be located at the same time. (2) We theoretically prove the security of the modified trust chain. (3) We investigate the formal development of PMBR based on B method. © 2008 IEEE.

0034940398	Checking inconsistency among viewpoints and viewpoints integration	By defining software's requirements from different standpoints, requirement definers often get partial requirement specifications (viewpoints). Because of the independence of viewpoints, viewpoints' integration is an important and difficult problem in requirements engineering. Viewpoint integration can be auto-processed when viewpoints' requirement and relations of viewpoints are formularized. In this paper, an SFSM state transition diagram is to describe viewpoint's requirement. Viewpoints' relaons are described in the guard condition of the state transition diagram. A method of checking and handling inconsistency among viewpoints based on SFSM is also presented. According to the conflict of the equivalence relation of states and the integrated state transition diagrams, requirement definers can check and handle viewpoints' inconsistency. The set of viewpoints can be integrated to the requirement specification of the whole software system after requirement definers repeat the process of integrating view points and handling inconsistency. In this paper, an example of telephone system is presented to illuminate the process of viewpoints' integration. Using this method, requirement definers can automatically achieve viewpoints' integration and can be educed to check and handle viewpoints' inconsistency.

Then, by means of input-output modeling method and instantaneous active power theory, a time domain mathematical model of the GC-VSI is set up. Besides, in order to resolve the GC-VSI active current and reactive current cross-coupling nonlinear control problem, a vector decoupling control method for the GC-VSI firing pulse generation is deduced in the dq synchronous rotating coordinates. The proposed decoupling control method can realize the active power and reactive power of the GC-VSI injected into the grid are regulated independently. Finally, the performance of the proposed GC-VSI system is evaluated by using MATLAB/Simulink simulation. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

The essential idea is analyzing program source codes, and identifying the correspondences between requirement entities and the program elements, such as variables and procedures. To avoid the need of pointing out all of the correspondences manually, correspondences, which are regarded as requirement properties, will be propagated on context-sensitive data flows. With these correspondence relations, those program behaviors unrelated to requirements can be tailored after a series of analyses, preserving the requirement properties for further processing. © 2012 Binary Information Press.

84877812946	Effect of microstructures on fatigue property of TC18 titanium alloy with equal strength	Mechanical properties including fatigue property and microhardness of pre and post fatiguing, have been investigated for four different microstructures (near bi-model, lamellar and basketweave) of TC18 titanium alloys. The correlation of condition fatigue strength and microhardness decreasing among different microstructures have been discussed. On the condition of equal strength and after 107 cycles, it was found that the near bi-model and fine basketweave microstructure have superior fatigue property compared with the lamellar and coarse basetweave microstructure, respectively. The decrease amplitudes of pre and post fatiguing for different microstructures were different. The near bi-model microstructure, which had high fatigue strength has almost the same microhardness of pre and post fatiguing. But the microhardness of lamellar and basketweave microstructures, which had inferior fatigue strengths decreased significantly. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84877821563	Preliminary study on the aerodynamic characteristics of an adaptive reconfigurable airfoil	A balloon-type airfoil, which has the classic airfoil shape but is full of air is designed in this paper. When the angle of attack changes, the pressure distribution on the airfoil surface will correspondingly be changed: the airfoil surface where the pressure is high will be pushed toward the inside of the airfoil resulting in the reduced curvature of this part of the airfoil and even a concave surface formed, but on the other hand, the curvature of the airfoil surface where the pressure is low will be increased. The initial shape of this adaptive reconfigurable airfoil used in this paper is NACA0012. As the forces acting on the airfoil surface should be in balance, a force balance equation is established at first. Then, the surface curvature of the airfoil as well as its shape can thereby be predicted. The flow field and the pressure distribution over the surface of the deformed airfoil can be simulated by use of the variational finite element method. In this paper, the pressure distribution over this adaptive airfoil as well as its corresponding shape under different incoming flows at angles of attack from -14 to 14 has been studied. At last, the XFoil software is used to calculate the coefficient of lift and drag and lift-to-drag ratio of the deformed airfoil. It has been found that this adaptive reconfigurable airfoil can automatically change its shape according to the pressure distribution over its surface and achieve better aerodynamic performance than NACA0012 airfoil in a wide range of application.

84887305292	Feature-preserving data reduction for accelerated volume rendering of time-varying datasets	The time-varying data visualization is a useful way for scientific discovery because it provides scientists a more in-depth understanding of the inherent physical phenomena behind the massive data. But due to irregular data access and the finite memory capacity bottlenecks on the hierarchical storage of the computer system, the interactive rendering ability for large-scale time-varying data are still a major challenge. Data compression strategy can partly solve the problem, but many redundant data will exist in volume data using this method. In this paper, a feature-preserving data reduction scheme based on the information theory is presented and the large-scale time-varying volume rendering can be substantially accelerated. Using the entropy based importance analysis, the featured data, which is preferred by the scientists, can be extracted from the rural data. Then the subsequent data compression and data transfer are directly operated on these extracted data, meanwhile, the remaining nonsense data was discarded during the process. At the same time, a GPU ray-casting volume render is used for fast rendering. Experimental results show that the multi-stage data reduction can greatly speed up the time-varying volume rendering even dealing with the large scale time-varying data. © 2012 IADIS.

Each mode has the specific natural frequency, damping ratio and modal shape. These modal parameters can be obtained by the calculation and experimental analysis. A calculation or test analysis process is called modal analysis. The analysis process is achieved if calculated by the finite element method, is called the analysis of calculating mode. The spindle mode of driving roll was analyzed in this paper. If clear structure in one easy frequency affected range of each order main modal characteristics through modal analysis method, it can predict the vibration response of this band structure of external or internal variety under the action of vibration. Therefore, the modal analysis is an important method for fault diagnosis of structure dynamic design. Comparing theory results with finite element results indicated that the error was less than 10 percent. The accuracy on the shaft modal analysis finite element method was improved. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

On one side, this problem possesses some amazing properties of computational complexity, and people are still searching for a polynomial time algorithm. On the other side, solving it and modal mu-calculus are almost the same in nature, so any efficient algorithm concerning this topic can be applied to model checking problem of modal mu-calculus. Considering the importance of modal mu-calculus in the automatic verification field, a series of model checkers will benefit from it. The main purpose of our study is to use constraints satisfaction problem (CSP), a deeply-studied and widely-accepted method, to settle parity game. The significance lies in that we can design efficient model checker through introducing various CSP algorithms, hence open a door to explore this problem of practical importance from a different viewpoint.

Isothermal oxidation test was carried out to evaluate the durability and oxidation behaviour of these systems. The results show that the roughness of bond coat significantly affects the lifetime of TBCs. With the increase in bond coat roughness, the lifetime decreases exponentially. The durability is enhanced by surface grinding treatments that decrease diffusion paths on the surface of the bond coat and diminish Al depletion rate.

The results show that the BT16 alloy phase transforms froms α+β to β at 780°C in the process of hydrogenation, and Widmanstatten structure is generated after cooling. The α phase can be found in all samples with different hydrogenation time, and its content decreases as the hydrogenation time increases; hydrides appear in the process of hydrogenation. This suggests that because of hydrogenation, the transition temperature at which the BT16 alloy phase transforms from α+β to β drops below 800°C, and the hydrogen content influences the existing form of hydrides. As the hydrogen content increases, the TiH phase appears earlier, the TiH

The relation expression between failure probability and RCF life was deduced with Weibull fracture statistic method for the silicon nitride ceramic ball in ball-cylinder geometric model. The tensile stress life model about silicon nitride ceramic balls was set up between RCF life and contact stress on the basis of the correlative numerical solution between the rating life and the maximum contact stress. It is conceived basing on maximum principal tensile stress. The failure cause, fatigue phenomenon and mechanics of balls are analyzed. The analysis shows that considering the maximum tensile stress as fatigue failure critical stress is reasonable. It is indicated that the tensile stress life model is feasible through RCF test with different stress level. It is verified by the tensile stress life model that silicon nitride ceramic balls failed by the maximum principal tensile stress, not by the maximum shear stress. In comparison with the L-P shear stress life model, the tensile stress life model is reasonable for RCF life prediction of silicon nitride ceramic balls. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thus, this research aims to give guidance on optimizing the design of this kind of airfoil with high lift coefficients. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique, the CFD simulation results have been compared with the experimental results available in the literature, and then the SST two-equation model is selected as the appropriate turbulence model. At a given cylinder surface velocity ratio, the cylinder diameter d, the drop height of trailing edgeδand the curvatures of the pressure and suction surfaces of the airfoil are regarded as the optimal design parameters and the airfoil lift coefficient is considered as the optimization objective function. Therefore, using orthogonal optimization method, we herein develop a new design of airfoil favorable for having a rotating leading edge.

78449253409	Deformation of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V under dynamic compression	Deformation localisation is the main reason for material failure in cold forging of titanium alloys and is thus closely related to the production yield of cold forging. Recent research has revealed that the width of shear band of titanium alloys after dynamic compression is related with their static and dynamic mechanical properties and processing parameters. To explore the influences of these factors on titanium alloys in dynamic compression, the distributions of stress, strain, strain rate and temperature of the specimens over the macro and microscales have been systematically studied. This work can be beneficial to process parameter optimisation and material designing for cold forging. In the study of the influence of process parameters on dynamic compression, considering material constitutive behaviour, physical parameters and process parameters, a numerical dynamic compression model for titanium alloys has been constructed. The entire dynamic compression process is simulated and a good agreement with experiments is observed. By extracting and comparing the stress, strain and temperature distribution under prescribed conditions, the effects of friction and compression velocity on the macrostate and distribution of strain and stress of compression samples are studied. Friction and compression rate are important factors influencing the spread and the stress state of deformation localisation zone. When friction is reduced to a certain level, deformation localisation can be effectively alleviated. The increase of friction and compression rate can lead to early appearance of tension stress in the deformation localisation zone, which may explain the experimental finding that crack tendency increases with higher compression rate and poorer lubrication. By adjusting the process parameters, the severity of strain localisation and stress state in the localised zone can be controlled thus enhancing the compression performance of titanium alloys. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The profile of the fatigue spalling takes the shape of an ellipse. The failure cause, fatigue phenomenon and mechanics are analyzed. The research shows that subsurface cracks play a dominant role in the formation of spalling failure. These cracks originated from volume defects of the material, and propagate, to form fatigue spalls under the action of principal tensile stresses. The contours of equal tensile stress of Oxy plane underneath surface are elliptical. Subsurface cracks are shape of ellipses and spall is also of the elliptic shape.

79955717524	Preliminary study on the matching characteristics between wind wheel and pump in a wind-powered water pumping system	In a wind-powered water pumping system, the water pump is driven directly by a wind wheel without any control system, other than a gear box. Thus, there exists a dynamic balance between the torque provided by the wind wheel and that accessed by the water pump. That is, the torque produced by the wind wheel will often be larger or smaller than that required by the pump. If so, the system will accelerate or decelerate, thus increasing or decreasing the torque provided by the wind wheel, which will then result in an increase or a decrease in that accessed by the pump until equilibrium is re-established. In addition, the amount of water that can be pumped corresponds directly to the effective power of the wind wheel, whereas the output torque and actual power from the wind wheel depend only on its rotation rate, which is a function of the wind speed. Hence, once a good match is obtained between the torque and the power provided by the wind wheel and those required by the pump, the entire system can operate most efficiently, maximizing the amount of water lifted by the pump. On the other hand, unlike steam or gas turbines, whose performance characteristics under different operating conditions have long been a popular subject for research, there are as yet very few studies of the characteristics of wind wheels under varying wind conditions, even though the wind changes continuously in speed and direction. Therefore, the primary purpose of this paper is to provide a preliminary investigation of wind wheel performance under time-varying wind conditions, while also studying the matching characteristics between a wind wheel and a water pump. The present paper is thus intended to help design and select a pump optimized for a wind-powered water pumping system, which could operate efficiently over a wide range of wind speeds. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

A transformation function which maps BDL into CCS is constructed and denoted by M[1-1]. For the sake of verifying properties of behavior-oriented requirements model, consistency of system, safety of system, behavioral trust and behavioral non-termination are depicted by μ-calculus, which is used to describe properties of labeled transition systems and for verifying these properties. At the end, an example described by BDL is analyzed and the specified properties are verified through CWB (Concurrency WorkBench) which is a model checking tool of CCS.

79959771598	Improved design of a S809 airfoil based on variable-domain variational finite element method	The performance of turbomachinery and airplane's wings is directly decided by the lift and drag characteristics of their airfoil adopted. The shape of traditional wind turbine airfoils is usually obtained based on empirical or semi-empirical methods. However, in this paper, we used the variable-domain variational finite element method (FEM) to obtain an improved design of a S809 airfoil through altering the distribution of pressure on its surface. Meanwhile, CFD simulations of this improved designed S809 airfoil were conducted for a range of 0~20 degree angle of attack and numerical results have proven that this improved design of S809 airfoil has better aerodynamic characteristics compared to the original one.

79960191747	Analytical solution on Magnus wind turbine power performance based on the blade element momentum theory	Instead of using conventional horizontal axis wind turbine blades, a Magnus wind turbine is equipped with rotating cylinders, which rotate around their own axes according to the principle of the Magnus effect. Based on the blade element momentum (or BEM) theory, an analytical analysis of the Magnus wind turbine power performance is conducted and its expression of power coefficient has been derived in this paper. The analytical solution has shown that there is a close relationship between the power coefficient of Magnus wind turbine and its physical parameters such as the tip rotor solidity, the tip speed ratio of Magnus turbine, and the relative speed of the cylinders rotation. In addition, a numerical BEM computation for the power coefficient of Magnus wind turbine is also performed using experimental lift and drag coefficients of a rotating cylinder obtained in the previous literature in order to validate the analytical solution. As a result, the aerodynamic characteristics of Magnus wind turbine observed in this study will be of some guiding significance for the initial research and preliminary design of Magnus wind turbines. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

79960331933	Effect of test rig structure parameters on contact stress of specimen	By using a new type pure rolling fatigue test rig with three contact points for silicon nitride bearing ball specimen, the stress relative difference value of a specimen with three contact points is, according to elastic contact theory, calculated while test rig being different parameters under a rolling contact condition. The effects of the driving roller and concave arc and roller radius on the stress relative difference value of the specimen are analyzed. The numerical results indicate that the stress relative difference value of specimen is less than 1% when the driving roller radius is 25 mm, concave arc radius is 40 mm, roller radius is 12.5 mm and the specimen radiuses change from 4.25 mm to 10.5 mm. The appropriate decrease of specimen radius scope can reduce the stress relative difference value of a specimen. The less stress relative difference value is, the less the effect on the specimen life is.

79960848376	Effects of particle plasticity characteristics on local interface stress in particle reinforced composite during uniaxial tension	For elastoplastic particle reinforced metal matrix composites, failure may originate from interface debonding between the particles and the matrix, both elastoplastic and matrix fracture near the interface. To calculate the stress and strain distribution in these regions, a single reinforcing particle axisymmetric unit cell model is used in this article. The nodes at the interface of the particle and the matrix are tied. The development of interfacial decohesion is not modelled. Finite element modelling is used, to reveal the effects of particle strain hardening rate, yield stress and elastic modulus on the interfacial traction vector (or stress vector), interface deformation and the stress distribution within the unit cell, when the composite is under uniaxial tension. The results show that the stress distribution and the interface deformation are sensitive to the strain hardening rate and the yield stress of the particle. With increasing particle strain hardening rate and yield stress, the interfacial traction vector and internal stress distribution vary in larger ranges, the maximum interfacial traction vector and the maximum internal stress both increase, while the interface deformation decreases. In contrast, the particle elastic modulus has little effect on the interfacial traction vector, internal stress and interface deformation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

80052398908	Relationship between microstructure and deformation behaviour during dynamic compression in Ti-3Al-5Mo-5V alloy	The relationship between microstructure and deformation and damage behaviour during dynamic compression in Ti-3Al-5Mo-5V alloy has been studied using several experimental techniques, including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and microhardness measurements. It was found that the deformation behaviour during dynamic compression was closely related to deformation parameters. After dynamic deformation, the deformation shear band that formed in the titanium alloy had microhardness similar to that of the matrix. However, the microhardness of the white shear band was much higher than the matrix microhardness. The effects of deformation parameters, including deformation rate and deformation degree, on deformation localisation were investigated. Based on the results from the present work, the microstructure and deformation processing parameters can be optimised. In addition, treatment methods after dynamic compression were explored to restore alloy properties. Using post-deformation heat treatment, the microstructure and property inhomogeneity caused by shear bands could be largely removed. © 2011 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

80052818254	Flow control effectiveness of synthetic jet on a stalled airfoil	Synthetic jet has attracted much attention for its use as an effective active flow control technique. With the aim of achieving a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and the critical fluid flow phenomena associated with synthetic jet, 2D simulations are conducted, in which a synthetic jet is placed on a NACA 0012 airfoil's upper surface near the leading edge simulating the periodic blowing and suction control at Re=5×105 and an angle of attack of 18°. Important control parameters, such as jet amplitude and frequency are investigated over a wide range and the jet width is also considered. Numerical results show that the recirculation region on the airfoil is decreased with a maximum increase in the lift by about 40 per cent and a reduced drag. The synthetic jet is found to be particularly effective at high forcing levels when the forcing frequency fe is close to the natural shedding frequency of the airfoil, and however become ineffective at low forcing levels. Use of higher forcing frequencies further decreases the drag of the airfoil but also reduces the lift. © Authors 2011.

80053969597	Effects of HIP treatment parameters on microstructure of ZTC4 casting titanium alloy	Quantitative metallography technique was used to investigate the effects of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) treatment parameters on microstructure of ZTC4 casting titanium alloy. The results show that the β grain size and α lamella thickness of ZTC4 increase obviously after HIP treatment relative to as-cast microstructure of ZTC4 alloy. With the increase of temperature and holding time of HIP treatment, β grain size and α lamella thickness increase in a near linear manner with a range of 40-70μm and 0.6-1μm respectively. However, with the increase of pressure of HIP treatment, the change of β grain size and α lamella thickness occurs from increase to decrease. Compared with as-cast microstructure, the growth rates of β grain size and α lamella thickness of ZTC4 titanium alloys after HIP treatment are 12%-25% and 57%-100% respectively.

In this paper, an approach is numerically investigated, which aims to improve the performance of vertical-axis marine current device through the installation of several straight plates around its periphery. The efficiency of a Darrieus-type marine current turbine with and without surrounding plates has been compared and the results indicate that these plates can form a narrow entrance in front of the device and effectively accelerate the water speed to increase the power output. Meanwhile due to its low cost, this approach has great potential to be applied to an actual project.

84255209233	A smart compression scheme for GPU-accelerated volume rendering of time-varying data	The visualization of large-scale time-varying data can provide scientists a more in-depth understanding of the inherent physical phenomena behind the massive data. However, because of non-uniform data access speed and memory capacity bottlenecks, the interactive rendering ability for large-scale time-varying data is still a major challenge. Data compression can alleviate these two bottlenecks. But just simply applying the data compression strategy to the visualization pipeline, the interaction problem can not be effectively solved because a lot of redundant data still existed in volume data. In this paper, a smart compression scheme based on the information theory is present to accelerate large-scale time-varying volume rendering. A formula of entropy was proposed, which can be used to automatically calculate the data importance to help scientists analyze and extract feature from the massive data. Then lossy data compression and data transfer is directly operated on these feature data, the remaining non-critical data was discarded in the process, and GPU ray-casting volume render is used for fast rendering. The experiment results shown that our smart compression scheme can reduce the amount of data as much as possible while maintaining the characteristics of the data, and therefore greatly improved the time-varying volume rendering speed even when dealing with the large scale time-varying data. © 2011 IEEE.

The tunneling current was minimum after 24 h and 6 h for blue and green LED due to the thermal annealing effect which reduced defects.

In this paper, the adaptive control and sliding mode control are combined to establish an adaptive sliding mode controller (ASMC) which is applied to a single degree of freedom magnetic bearing controlling system. With the system parameters changing the real-time control system can change the corresponding control parameters to make the system performance always maintain the optimal or nearly optimal. The simulation model of the single degree of freedom magnetic bearing based on ASMC and an experimental platform using PC as upper computer and TMS320F2812 as hypogyny are established. The simulation and experimental results show that the ASMS not only weaken the inherent chattering in the sliding mode control, but also has better robustness and rapidity.

But if there is not any treatment, the electrical properties of light emitting diode are very poor. So to get excellent electrical properties of light emitting diode, annealing is an effective method to improve the electrical properties of light emitting diode using indium tin oxide as the current spreading layer. However, the annealing time and temperature can affect the electrical property of light emitting diode individually. In order to investigate this problem, we measured the series resistance and ideality factor of the light emitting diode got under different annealing time and annealing temperature. According to the model proposed by Jay M. Shah, we can inferred the characteristics of indium tin oxide and P-type GaN contact. The results showed that: the electrical properties of the light-emitting diode can reach an excellent value with increasing annealing temperature and time, and if continuing to increase in temperature or time, it can lead to a decline in light-emitting diode electrical properties. It is very helpful to optimize the annealing temperature and time and manufacture excellent electrical properties of devices. © Chinese Physical Society.

84867608051	Dynamical integrity of codes: Model and method	In the research of information security and trusted computing, measuring dynamic integrity of codes under adversaries' attacks is an important problem, especially in the context, such as wireless sensor network, cloud computing etc. In the open and less coupled systems, this issue is much more urgent. Hardware-based technologies of trusted computing and methods in (software based) code attestation can successfully measure some property of program, static or code oriented, but fail to measure integrity of certain behaviors during the executing of codes. This situation partially is due to the lack of proper theory of dynamic integrity, which can be changed with sound and precise concepts and models of measuring dynamic integrity. In this paper, we develop the concept of dynamic integrity after analysis of attacks and model of measuring dynamic integrity, and use the idea of provable secure from cryptography to give a formal notion of the concept. And we discuss its relationship with several other cryptography primitives, such as message authentication code schemes, code obfuscation etc. Based on the model, a complier-aided flow embedding method is proposed to achieve a weak form of dynamic integrity scheme, and security and efficiency are analyzed with some reasonable assumptions. Finally, we discuss how to compile any program enhanced by dynamic integrity measurable scheme and issues concerning the compiling process.

The electrical and optical parameters of LED were characterized before and after electrostatic discharge stressing with the theoretical analysis of the influence of electrostatic on LED reliability. After human body mode static crack down on the GaN-based blue LED, the I-V characteristic curve changed, the luminous flux reduced, LED's degradation rate was also accelerated. It is deduced that the LED was hit by electrostatic generates secondary defects and melting channel inside the chip. Based on the result of I-V characteristic curve at different temperature, we assumed that the shallow level ionization is dominated in LED, while after static crack down, the deep level ionization is dominant. Therefore, a failure mechanism caused by electrostatic can be deduced as follow. The generation of secondary defects and melting channel, the shallow level/deep level carrier movement and the change of radiative/non-radiative recombination, cause the degradation of LED performance. These find make great efforts to understand the failure mechanism caused by the electrostatic discharge and anti-static design.

84868340855	Numerical study on coupling effects among multiple Savonius turbines	A Savonius rotor can be used as a wind or water current energy conversion device that produces electricity. In spite of their simple structure and assembly, Savonius turbines have less commercial appeal than other types of turbines due to their relatively low energy conversion efficiency. In order to increase the output power of a Savonius turbine, most studies have only focused on optimization of the rotor configuration or installation of ancillary equipment around the rotor. However, previous research has found that a beneficial interaction that existed between two parallel Savonius turbines can also augment the power output of each rotor if they are rotating side by side. This paper numerically examines the interactions among multiple Savonius turbines with the help of the commercial computational fluid dynamics software fluent and finds that these coupling effects can effectively increase the overall power output of a Savonius turbine farm, especially when Savonius turbines are arranged relatively close together. Numerical results also indicate that the separation distance and relative phase angle between the two adjacent Savonius rotors can greatly influence this positive interaction between them. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

From the analysis, the internal reason for the phosphor conversion efficiency varying with the driving current mainly has two kinds: first, as the current increases, the quantum confined Stark effect causes a blue shift of the peak wavelength of the blue chips, resulting in reduced matching for blue light and phosphor;second, due to the current increasing leads to device temperature rising, the non-radiation of the phosphor is increasing and excited state energy level is splitting seriously, resulting in part of the energy decreasing, and the yellow wavelength presents red shift. By analyzing the combined effects of these two factors, the law of the phosphor conversion efficiency with the current changes is obtained, and the recommendations to improve the current characteristics of the white LED are made.

Moreover, the performance of the HV-LED with failure cells is examined. The analysis indicates that the failure cell has a parallel resistance which induces the leakage of the failure cell. The series resistance of the failure cell is 76.8 Ω, while that of the normal cell is 21.3 Ω. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image indicates that different metal layers do not contact well. It is hard to deposit the metal layers in the deep isolation trenches. The fabrication process of HV-LEDs needs to be optimized. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84871909784	Experimental study of a new vertical axis water current device	A conventional Savonius rotor has many advantages over others in that its constructions are simpler and cheaper; it is independent of the fluid direction and has a good starting torque at lower wind or water speeds. However, Savonius rotors are not commonly used as wind turbines or water current power generating devices because of its relatively low energy conversion efficiency. Thus, how to improve the performance of Savonius rotor is a hot research topic attracting a growing attention in the field of renewable energy utilization. Previous research suggests that a mutual coupling effect exists between two Savonius rotors when rotating side by side and this effect can increase both rotors' power output. Therefore, based on this fact, a new water current power generating device composed of two Savonius rotors and collect-shield plates is designed in this paper. A model of this device was constructed and tested in a water tank. Experimental results showed that with such a structure, the power output of each Savonius rotor can be increased by as much as 38%. In addition, the influences of the lateral distance between two Savonius rotors and the angle of collect-shield plate relative to the incoming flow on this efficiency improvement in Savonius rotor were also studied in the present experiments.

84872145961	Situ observations of structural transformation in TB5 titanium alloy during one way tensile test	Microstructure transformation in Ti-15V-3Cr-3Sn-3Al(TB5) titanium alloy during one way tensile test was studied in situ observations of the video microscope. The results show that the change of the microstructure of the titanium alloy in uniaxial tension is not obvious in the elastic stage, but according to the change of the slip bands in the microstructure it can be divided into three stages following with the increase of the deformation in the plastic stage. The three stages are the single slip, the multiple slip and the cross slip. Geometric hardening occurs from the single slip to the multiple slip in uniaxial tension, so the change of the grains slows down and the rotation range of the slip bands is smaller.

84872529038	Design of an electromechanical coordination vibration suppression method for VAWT main spindle	Because of its advantageous aerodynamic performance, the vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) has gained more and more attention. This paper studies the vibration characteristic of the VAWT main spindle, and presents a mechanical and electromechanical coordination vibration suppression method for the VAWT main spindle. The proposed method can measure main spindle current vibration intensity in real-time. And when the main spindle vibration intensity exceeds preset critical control threshold value, the method can use both the on-line intelligent analysis decision and the mechanical and electromechanical coordinated controller to suppress the main spindle vibration, as well as to make the VAWT maintain mechanical stability. At the same time, the method can ensure the VAWT meets maximum wind energy capture efficiency as far as possible. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84875411265	A three-dimensional numerical study of the Magnus wind turbine with different blade shapes	Although the Magnus type wind turbine has many benefits over conventional blade-type wind turbines, it normally has low wind energy utilization efficiency. Therefore, it is important to seek effective ways of improving the Magnus wind turbine power performance in order to promote its application. As blade aspect ratio is a critical parameter influencing the Magnus wind turbine performance, a 3D numerical study of a Magnus type wind turbine which is equipped with cylindrical blades with different aspect ratios has been conducted in this paper. In addition, various cylinder shapes, including truncated cone and wavy cylinder, have also been used and their effects on the performance of the Magnus wind turbine are analyzed. Performance characteristics such as power, torque, and thrust coefficients of the Magnus turbine with different blade shapes are compared and discussed with the aim of identifying the desirable blade characteristics for this type of turbine. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

84875417052	Numerical study on aerodynamic performances of the wind turbine rotor with leading-edge rotation	The flow control using leading-edge rotating cylinder on both two-dimensional NACA 63418 airfoil section and three-dimensional two-bladed wind turbine rotor has been studied by means of numerical simulations. For the two-dimensional NACA 63418 airfoil with a fasting spinning cylinder at the leading-edge, flow separation occurs on the pressure side of the airfoil near the clearance between rotating cylinder and stationary airfoil at small angles of attack; however, flow separation on the suction side of the airfoil can be suppressed at large angles of attack. The aerodynamic performances of the leading-edge rotation (LER) wind turbine rotors with two twisted/non-tapered blades and with two twisted/tapered blades have been studied, respectively. The result shows that the power efficiency of the LER wind turbine with twisted/non-tapered blades is superior to the uncontrolled wind turbine rotor remarkably at high tip speed ratios. The aerodynamic control effects of the leading-edge rotating cylinder have also been studied under various wind speeds. On the basis of the aerodynamic characteristics of non-tapered LER wind turbine rotor, the power output of the rotor can be optimized through adjusting the cylinder rotational speed in various wind speeds. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

The results show that the microstructure of α layer is coarse lamellar, which is generated due to the interface reaction between titanium liquid and mold materials. The α layer has great influence on the impact properties of ZTC4 titanium castings. By comparison with that of the casting sample without α layer, as the side with α layer in castings sample is impacted, the decrease of impact strength of the casting sample is about 9%, while the opposite side in castings sample is impacted, the decrease of impact strength of the casting sample is about 80%.

84879519990	Behavioral model based requirements visualization method	Aimed at finding a solution to the difficulty of requirement's expression and communication problem of a complex software system, this paper presents a visualization method. This method is based on system behavior sequences, which are indicated by behavior description language-BDL, it would build up a behavioral model if BDL's syntax and semantic are correct. Animation execution mechanism takes state machine and state block as its execution model and description model, each state migration correspond one behavior. Developers can realize the behavioral model based visualization by setting animation elements (eg. subjects and objects) and associate atom behaviors within its related animation primitive language. The advantages of this method is allowing users to watch the dynamic execution of the model visually, and hence assist users of variety background to understand the exact meaning of software behavior. Thus decrease the requirement change and hence reduce software development costs. And BDL model must pass several tests that ensure the correctness of requirements animation. And it gives the correctness proof of transformation rules which is from behavior model to state model, provides theoretical verification for the transformation. At last, a school plus system is presented to illustrate the requirements modeling method and the implementation of visualization.

84879965160	Field-sensitive function pointer analysis using field propagation for state graph extraction	Accurate state graph is important to static program analysis. In order to extract reliable state graphs from programs, which contains function pointers, for model analysis in software engineering, we proposed a field-sensitive may-alias analysis using field propagation, which tries to discover deeply implied aliasing relations by propagating the aliases to variables from their nested structures. For the high complexity of alias analysis, several optimizations are proposed for performance with the price of potentially losing few aliases. Unlike Most previous works which adopted various kinds of approximations that would compromise the reliability of the results, our field-propagation analyzer makes sure that the solutions of queried pointers are sound in a flow-insensitive manner, because none of our adopted optimizations would bring in approximation to the results. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

84900467863	Proof carrying data for conditional data flow	With the development of modern computation environment, how to entrust computation involving many untrustful parties is more and more important. In the theory of proof-based trustiness, proof carry data system attaches any data in the distributed environment with proofs, which assert not only the correctness of the computation of the party itself, but rather than correctness of all the computation done by all the parties involved in the flow of computation. This gives a feasible solution to ensure integrity and generate trust for distributed computing. But current proof carrying data system is limited to static data flow without conditional flows and can only handle data ow with polynomial interaction complexity which could be exponential of its depth. We generalize proof carrying data system for any conditional data flow and improve the scale of proof carrying data to data flow of polynomial depth respect to the security parameter, rather than the interaction complexity of the flow, which is crucial for data flow with high interaction complexity. © 2014 Binary Information Press.

Considering wind energy's drastically nonlinear and uncertainty features, the proposed control strategy adopts wind turbine's optimum tip speed ratio (TSR) tracking algorithm to achieve maximum energy conversion efficiency, and implements an extended state observer (ESO) of the wind turbine aerodynamic torque with an adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) method to realize high tracking performance for the optimum TSR. The integral term in the sliding mode surface function can ensure the TSR tracking control without steady error. The wind turbine aerodynamic torque can be evaluated exactly by the ESO which increases the determinacy of wind power disturbance in MPPT control system. Due to the new reaching-law algorithm designed by power combination function and optimum speed tracking error negative feedback loop, the gain of the switch function is granted the capability of automatic adjust with TSR tracking error, and the chattering amplitude can be progressively damped. Simulation results show that the proposed controller has a better stability, adaptability and robustness compared with that of intelligent PID controller.
