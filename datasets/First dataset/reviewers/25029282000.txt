33744751184	Distribution and migration of heavy metals in soil profiles by high-resolution sampling	The vertical distribution of heavy metals in soils profiles is a result of heavy metals accumulation and migration under combining influence of edaphic factors and environmental conditions. It's an important basis for evaluation of heavy metals pollution and remediation of contaminated soils. By traditional sampling methods, i.e., soils were sampled according to pedogenetic horizons, only very general information about element migration can be learned. In the current study, three sites near a steel factory were selected to represent three types of land use, i.e. forest, dry land for vegetable cultivation and rice paddy field. Soils were sampled horizontally by high-resolution sampling method. In the top of 40 cm soils were sectioned in 2 cm intervals, then 5 cm intervals in next 40 cm, and 10 cm intervals in the last 20 cm of profile. Total content of Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr and Cd were determined, and the vertical distribution of Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Cd in every profile was analyzed. The results indicated that enrichment of heavy metals appeared in the upper most layer of the natural forest soil that without any anthropic disturbance, and this phenomenon proved that heavy metals were coming from atmospheric deposition. We found that Cu, Zn and Pb moved downward in a short distance, Cd migrated relatively faster than Cu, Zn and Pb, while Cr had no recognizable location of migration front. In the soil profiles of dry land and paddy field, there were influences of agricultural practice, the distribution and movement of metals were thus different form those of the forest soil. In cultivated layer heavy metals were evenly distributed because soils in the upper layer were mixed by cultivation, however, bellow the cultivated layer obvious migration took place again. It is concluded that different heavy metals have different mobility and there is such a relative order: Cd>Cu>Zn>Pb. The study shows that the distribution pattern can be obtained with the currently adopted high-resolution sampling method, than traditional horizon sampling, and more precise migration distance and rates can be estimated.

33845682070	Establishing a spatial grouping base for surface soil properties along urban-rural gradient-A case study in Nanjing, China	Conventional classification systems based on vegetation and land use are frequently used to characterize or describe urban soils to determine the influence of urbanization on soils. In this study, the sensitivity of different grouping methods in reflecting soil variations along an urban-rural gradient was compared. The objective of this study was to determine the most sensitive grouping system in depicting and explaining variations of soil attributes around an urban area. Grouping methods, including urban-rural division, in situ vegetation type, land use types in different scales and numerical clustering, were compared for both single soil attributes and "soil set" defined by multiple variables. The result shows urbanization has a strong impact on many soil properties, especially that of gravel content, sand content, pH, phosphorus and soil compaction. In terms of the variations of soil attributes, in situ vegetation type is the most sensitive in comparison with local land use types and district-viewed land use types. In other words, soil properties in this study are not sensitive to coarser spatial resolution. Therefore, it's hard to interpret the spatial variation of urban soil by regular methods using natural soil-landscape paradigm. Furthermore, vegetation would best proxy the delineation of single attribute of urban soils. Numerical clusters effectively reflect the land use types and their change during urbanization. All clusters were interpreted as different sets with practical meanings: soil in abandoned greenbelt, soil in ill-managed greenbelt, soil in new vegetable land, extreme urban conditioned soil, soil in well-managed greenbelt, soil in highly mellowed vegetable land, soil in common urban-peri-urban greenbelt and weak-urban-impacted soil. They can be used as bases for soil regionalization in urban and peri-urban environment. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, soil was taken from fields of grass (before rubber plantation), immature rubber (before tapping), and mature rubber (after tapping) at a tropical farm in Hainan, China. Soil organic matter, plant nutrients, cations, and soil pH were determined. Rubber cultivation resulted in significant decline of soil organic C and microbial biomass C. Available P was extremely low for all soils, resulting from the naturally low P content and the high sorption capacity of highly weathered Ferralsol. Furthermore, soil pH decreased by about 0.5 units, accompanied by an increase of exchangeable Al by more than one-fold. Regression analysis demonstrated that soil acidification was characterized by the depletion of base cations and release of Al. To maintain tropical soil quality, farming practices such as liming and organic amendment should be included in the best management practices of rubber farm. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

34247402214	Defining the geochemical baseline: A case of Hong Kong soils	A geochemical baseline provides the means to distinguish between the pedogenic origin and the anthropogenic origin of the trace element in the environmental compartments. We collected 271 soil samples representative of different parent rocks and soil types from the whole territory of Hong Kong and analyzed the composition of clay mineralogy and the contents of 15 chemical elements (Fe, Cd, As, etc.) for these samples. The baseline was predicted with the method of the normalization procedure combined with the relative cumulative frequency curve. The result indicated that Fe was the best reference element for the normalization procedure among the five potential reference elements (Fe, Al, Sc, Ti, and Mn), followed by Sc and Ti. A poor correlation was found between Sc, Ti, and Cu. The predicted baseline was much lower than the A-value of the Dutch List used usually in screening the polluted soil of Hong Kong, implying that the extent of heavy metal pollution might have been underestimated with respect to local lands. We also applied the cluster analysis to distinguish the geochemical associations of the trace elements due to its importance to the baseline. Approximately three major associations including the Fe-Mn-oxides related, Al oxides or Al-bearing-clay-mineralogy related and sulfide- related associations were observed from the dendrogram. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

84908103869	Extracting and mapping of soil depth distribution rules in complex landscape environment	Soil depth is one of the most important input parameters for hydroecological models in arid and semiarid regions. However, soil depth is highly variable spatially and traditional measures of soil depth are laborious, time consuming and even difficult to practically perform, especially in the complex landscape areas. In these areas, the mapping based on the relationships between soil properties and environmental factors may be useful. However, the approach used to establish their relationships is limited. Therefore, this study proposed an efficient method for obtaining and establishing the soil-environment relationships in complex landscape environments. The method was based on an fuzzy clustering method (fuzzy C-means, FCM) and decision tree (DT). Using this method, the relationships between soil depth distribution and environmental factors in a typical alpine watershed in the Qilian Mountains, northwestern China with easy-to-obtain environmental covariates data was established. The method was based on the assumption that soil was the production of the interaction among its formative environmental factors with time. The environment variables, such as altitude, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index and normalized differential vegetation index, were extracted as auxiliary variables for data analysis. A total of 3626 points obtained by FCM and DT methods was as training sample set, and 31 points collecting from field survey through representative sampling strategy was used as validation sample set. The method consisted of 4 steps: 1) to define the environmental factors playing dominant roles in formation and development of soil depth, then to obtain the environmental niches by running FCM analysis (after correlation analyses altitude, profile curvature and terrain wetness index were selected to carry out FCM analysis); 2) to assign the ranked distribution of soil depth based on the field investigation data and pedogenesis principles; 3) to select the typical areas of fuzzy membership threshold greater than 0.5, and to randomly choose a certain number of points which were proportional to area extent, and to possess an approximate quantity of points, then to extract the locating information of environmental factors so as to build up the training sample set; 4) to obtain the critical thresholds of soil environmental factors and the knowledge about soil-environment relationships by running training sample set through the DT arithmetic. The method was applied in a typical alpine watershed of the Qilian Mountain, the Heihe River basin, and the soil depth distribution map was created. In addition, an independently field sample set was used to validate the effectiveness of the method in establishing the relationships between soil depth and environmental factors. Its overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient reached 74.2% and 0.659 respectively. Therefore, the proposed method is an optional efficient solution for predictive soil depth mapping in the complex landscape environment.

The results showed that there was a great difference in the infiltration rate among the soils with different compactness. Soil infiltration rate decreased with increasing bulk density and decreasing porosity, and the water-transport-limiting layer existed in heavily compacted soils resulted in a dramatic decrease of final stabilized infiltration rate.

Pedogenetic soil horizons are one of the fundamental building blocks of modern soil classiflcation; however, in soils of urban areas which are often strongly disturbed by human activities, horizons are difficult to distinguish but substitutive morphological layers may be identifled. To identify the characteristic soil layers in an urban environment, 224 soil layers of 36 in-situ pedons were examined and described in urban and suburban Nanjing, and 27 variables were extracted for multivariate analysis. Three groups and six subdivisions were identifled by TwoStep cluster analysis combined with hierarchical cluster analysis based on factor scores. Soil forming factors and soil forming processes could be interpreted from the principal component analysis (PCA) of variables, cluster analysis of soil layers, and discriminant analysis of soil layer groups and their subdivisions. Parent materials, moisture regimes, organic matter accumulation, and especially nutrient accumulation were the main causes of characteristic soil layer formations. The numerical approaches used in this study were useful tools for characteristic soil layer identiflcation of urban soils. © 2008 Soil Science Society of China.

All the samples were divided into calibration set and prediction set based on the prediction effect of single wavelength model, and then the spectra were pretreated by Multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC) and Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing methods. The following five wave bands, the whole region 400-2500 nm, 400-1100 nm, 1100-1900 nm, 1900-2500 nm, 580-900 nm were selected, and 15 calibration models were constructed for each band selected by the original spectra, the first derivative spectra and the second derivative spectra respectively. By simultaneous adjusting the numbers of SG smoothing points and PLS factors, the PLScomputational experiments for each model were carried out and the best model was selected according to the prediction effect. The results indicate that the prediction effect of the model using the first derivative spectra in 1900-2500 nm is the best, and its prediction correlation coefficient (RP), RMSEP and RRMSEP are 0.806, 31.0 mg/kg, and 19.96% respectively. Obtained results show that 1900-2500 nm can replace the whole band to get a better calibration effect, and can provide a basis for the design of special soil near-infrared spectroscopy instruments.

The results showed that all the QRC profiles can be classified into three types: Type A, mainly distributed between 29°N and 31°N, share the similar characteristics with the Xiashu Loess, with the uniformity of grain-size and elemental compositions and the enrichment of the basic dust fraction (10μm-63μm), which may originate from aeolian dust deposits and is hence called a loess-like QRC. Type B, mainly distributed between 25°N and 28°N, shows alluvial features, with many coarse grains and large-scale vertical variation of grain-size and chemical compositions. Type AB, distributed between Type A and Type B, approximately 28°N-29°N, shows double-unit structure: The upper part is similar to Type A; the lower, however, shows alluvial features like Type B. The loess-like QRC is mainly distributed along the Yangtze River, but gradually declines southwards and is rarely seen south of 28°N. The existence of the loess-like QRC is strong evidence for the occurrence of heavy dustfalls in the modern red-soil areas in subtropical China during the Quaternary glacial periods. The region distributed with the loess-like QRC is at least 3° latitude south of the Xiashu Loess, implying that the loess/red clay boundary in the Yangtze Valley had once oscillated with the alternations between glacial and interglacial climates during the Quaternary period. The loess-like QRC actually includes both glacial and interglacial paleoclimatic information. We suggest that the Yellow-brown Earth (YBE) in the upper QRC was formed during the last glacial period; the underlying red clay, with the aeolian dust characteristics but being strongly weathered, was initially deposited during the second last glacial or earlier glacial stages but heavily weathered and rubefied in the subsequent interglacial events. No multi-cyclical paleoclimatic records were found in the QRC profiles due to the overlapped information. But the weathering degree of the profiles clearly show a trend of decreasing upwards, which suggests that the climate in the Yangtze Valley has become colder and drier since the late Quaternary period. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

With the aim of promoting the application of soil science knowledge, this paper reviews the achievements of Chinese scientists in soil resource use and management, soil fertility, global change mitigation and soil biology over the last 30 years. During this period, soil resource science has provided essential support for the use and exploitation of Chinese soil resources, and has itself developed through introduction of new theories such as Soil Taxonomy and new technologies such as remote sensing. Soil fertility science has contributed to the alleviation and elimination of impeding physical and chemical factors that constrain availability of essential nutrients and water in soils, the understanding of nutrient cycling in agroecosystems, and the increase in nutrient use efficiency for sustainable crop production. Chinese soil scientists have contributed to the understanding of the cropland's role in global change, particularly to the understanding of methane and nitrous oxide emission from rice fields and the effect of elevated carbon dioxide and ozone on rice-wheat system. Soil biology research has progressed in biological N fixation, distribution of fauna in Chinese soils, and bioremediation of polluted soils. A new generation of soil scientists has arisen in the last three decades. The gaps between research and application in these soil science fields are also discussed. © 2011 Soil Science Society of China.

It is shown that the soils' amendment with lime powder and the periodic ponding of rice paddies with carbonate-rich water lead to the considerable transformation of the initial soils. The general properties of these soils and their morphological, micromorphological, and mineralogical features have been analyzed, and isotopic studies of the carbonate concentrations have been performed. The studied soils differ in the degree of their secondary calcification. The presence of lithogenic and pedogenic carbonates in the soils has been proved. Among the pedogenic carbonates, younger and older concentrations can be distinguished. The major feature of the carbonate concentrations in the studied soils is the coprecipitation of calcium and iron in the clay soil matrix. In general, the studied soil profiles display the initial stages of calcification. At the same time, there are certain analogies between the process of calcification in the paddy soils and the formation of thick accumulative calcareous crusts in some soils of northeastern China. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

Two modeling methods (decision tree analysis and linear discriminant analysis) were used, and their applications were compared. Much more effort was put on selecting soil covariates for modeling. First, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the variance of terrain attributes between soil orders. Then, a stepwise procedure was used to select soil covariates for linear discriminant analysis, and a backward removing procedure was developed to select soil covariates for tree modeling. At the same time, ANOVA results, as well as our knowledge and experience on soil mapping, were also taken into account for selecting soil covariates for tree modeling. Two linear discriminant models and four tree models were established finally, and their prediction performances were validated using a multiple jackknifing approach. Results showed that the discriminant model built on ANOVA results performed best, followed by the discriminant model built by stepwise, the tree model built by the backward removing procedure, the tree model built according to knowledge and experience on soil mapping, and the tree model built automatically. The results highlighted the importance of selecting soil covariates in modeling for soil mapping, and suggested the usefulness of methods used in this study for selecting soil covariates. The best discriminant model was finally selected to map soil orders for this area, and validation results showed that thus produced soil order map had a high accuracy. © 2011 Soil Science Society of China.

79959588410	Impact of Long-Term Alfalfa Cropping on Soil Potassium Content and Clay Minerals in a Semi-Arid Loess Soil in China	Alfalfa cropping has been considered an efficient method of increasing soil fertility. Usually nitrogen increase in root nodules is considered to be the major beneficial effect. A 21-year time series (five sampling periods) of alfalfa cultivation plots on a loess soil, initially containing illite and chlorite, in Lanzhou of northwestern China was selected to investigate the relationships among alfalfa cropping, soil potassium (K) content and soil clay minerals. The results indicated that soil K significantly accumulated after cropping, with a peak value at about 15 years, and decreased afterwards. The accumulated K was associated with the K increase in the well-crystallized illite, which was not extracted by the traditional laboratory K extraction methods in assessing bioavailability. The steep decline in soil K content after 15-year cropping was in accord with the observed fertility loss in the alfalfa soil. Plant biomass productivity peaked at near 9 years of culture, whereas soil K and clay minerals continued to increase until cropping for 15 years. This suggested that K increased in the topsoil came from the deep root zone. Thus alfalfa continued to store K in clays even after peak production occurred. Nitrogen did not follow these trends, showing a general decline compared with the native prairie soils that had not been cropped. Therefore, the traditional alfalfa cropping can increase K content in the topsoil. © 2011 Soil Science Society of China.

Materials and methods: Ten typical land use patterns with various vegetation and age were selected in Nanjing City, China to determine the infiltration rates by the dual-ring method. Three replicated sites were done in the same combined mode. At the same time, other soil physical and chemical properties that may affect infiltration rate were also determined. In addition, urban surface runoff coefficients were estimated according to final infiltrations and rain intensities in the different degrees of soil compaction. The quality of flood water from a strong rainstorm in a main road in Nanjing was analyzed. Results and discussion: The final infiltration rates of urban soils were highly variable (from very slow to very fast). Low soil infiltration rates are related to many factors; however, urban soil compaction is the leading one. Infiltration rates decreased with an increase in the bulk density and with a reduction in the air-filled porosity. Thus, large amounts of macropores increase the infiltration rate and reduce surface runoff. Runoff coefficients of compacted soils with low infiltration rates were high, especially for extremely compacted soil. As a result, the prevalence of flooding is high in compacted soils, and the quality of surface runoff water is reduced during flooding events. The concentrations of NO

The threshold concept was applied to increase our understanding of paddy soil genesis processes. Results showed that 50 yr of paddy cultivation induced measurable accumulation of soil organic C (SOC) in the surface horizon and marked reduction of magnetic susceptibility (MS), soft isothermal remanent magnetization (IRMs), and Ca, Mg, and Na elemental concentrations.

84858281942	Pedotransfer functions for estimating soil bulk density in China	Soil bulk density (BD), which can be measured by several labor-intensive procedures, is frequently missing from soil databases. However, it is an essential parameter in many calculations and models, and pedotransfer functions (PTFs) can be developed to estimate it. In this article, the predictive accuracy of 19 published PTFs was evaluated using soil data sets from China. In addition, exploratory stepwise regression models were proposed and validated. The data used in model development were legacy data from various sources and were divided randomly into two sets: a training set for model development with 75% of the data and a validation set for model validation with 25% of the data. The results show that existing models, developed by Alexander (1980) (P1), Manrique and Jones (1991) (P7), and Périé and Ouimet (2008) (N6), respectively, produced relatively accurate predictions. However, the first two models were inappropriate for soils containing a large amount of soil organic carbon. The exploratory model (Model 1) indicated that soil organic matter, organic matter, total nitrogen, and clay were the four most important factors in BD prediction. The exploratory model and its simplified version (Model 3) had higher prediction accuracies than previously published PTFs. The results show that parameters tailored to the current data improved prediction accuracy for the nonlinear model (Model 2). Compared with the exploratory model (Model 1), its simplified version and the nonlinear model, with only one variable, had good prediction accuracies as demonstrated by validation.

84860455410	Mapping Soil Texture of a Plain Area Using Fuzzy-c-Means Clustering Method Based on Land Surface Diurnal Temperature Difference	The use of landscape covariates to estimate soil properties is not suitable for the areas of low relief due to the high variability of soil properties in similar topographic and vegetation conditions. A new method was implemented to map regional soil texture (in terms of sand, silt and clay contents) by hypothesizing that the change in the land surface diurnal temperature difference (DTD) is related to soil texture in case of a relatively homogeneous rainfall input. To examine this hypothesis, the DTDs from moderate resolution imagine spectroradiometer (MODIS) during a selected time period, i.e., after a heavy rainfall between autumn harvest and autumn sowing, were classified using fuzzy-c-means (FCM) clustering. Six classes were generated, and for each class, the sand (> 0.05 mm), silt (0.002-0.05 mm) and clay (< 0.002 mm) contents at the location of maximum membership value were considered as the typical values of that class. A weighted average model was then used to digitally map soil texture. The results showed that the predicted map quite accurately reflected the regional soil variation. A validation dataset produced estimates of error for the predicted maps of sand, silt and clay contents at root mean of squared error values of 8.4%, 7.8% and 2.3%, respectively, which is satisfactory in a practical context. This study thus provided a methodology that can help improve the accuracy and efficiency of soil texture mapping in plain areas using easily available data sources. © 2012 Soil Science Society of China.

84863267326	Heavy metals accumulation in Nanjing cultural layers during the past 20 centuries	The Nanjing cultural layers are accumulation horizon which include the artifacts, sediments and other materials that were produced and deposited by human activity and that accumulated over a discrete time period.The accumulation of heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn) in the Nanjing cultural layers shows a tendency to increase during the last twenty centuries, and occurred chiefly in four different historical periods such as in the Present Time, Qing Dynasty, Ming Dynasty and South Dynasty. There are many great differences in the accumulation of heavy metals of the cultural layers between two areas. One is located from the Daxing Palace to the Ming Palace, which was the political, economic and cultural center of the Ming and South Dynasties in Nanjing. The other is located in the drainage area of Qinhuai Canal, which was a handmade industry and manufacturing, trade and residential center. The different accumulation of heavy metals in two groups of cultural layers indicates that the accumulation of heavy metals may make a record of the course of human events and activities. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

84863167879	Sensitivity of digital soil maps based on FCM to the fuzzy exponent and the number of clusters	Fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) has been used frequently in digital soil mapping. One of the key issues in applying FCM is the determination of the appropriate classification parameters of the fuzzy exponent (m) and the number of clusters (c). To determine the optimal selection of appropriate m and c values, in this study, we first used two simulated datasets to demonstrate the sensitivity of three commonly used validity functions to m and c. These two simulated datasets contained overlapping clusters and hierarchical clusters, respectively. The three studied validity functions were fuzzy performance index (FPI), compactness and separation (S) and a derivative of the objective function with respect to the fuzzy exponent (-[(δJ

84865357235	Uncertainty analysis for the evaluation of agricultural soil quality based on digital soil maps	Spatial soil quality information is needed for the agricultural development in Hong Kong. This study produced digital maps of more than 20 soil quality indicators of a study area in Hong Kong, using digital soil mapping techniques. These maps were then employed to evaluate the soil quality of this area via the application of scoring functions and integrated quality index (IQI) methods. The accuracy and uncertainty of the evaluated spatial soil quality information were assessed based on a probability sample and sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS), respectively. The sources of uncertainty were analyzed using stochastic sensitivity analysis. The results showed that mapping accuracy varied dramatically among soil indicators, with soil quality index (SQI) in the area ranging from 0.43 to 0.87. The obtained spatial soil quality information appeared to be moderately accurate with high uncertainty, which suggests that it cannot be fully relied on. The soil quality could have been overestimated with a probability of more than 0.95 for nearly half of the study area while being underestimated for 0.2% of the study area. Hence, this study shows that it is vitally important to derive uncertainty for soil quality information evaluated based on digital soil maps. Generally, heavily weighted soil quality indicators in the soil quality evaluation model contributed the most uncertainty, such as available phosphorus (A-P), total phosphorus (TP), and bulk density in this study. © Soil Science Society of America.

84865863198	Spatio-temporal change of soil organic matter content of Jiangsu Province, China, based on digital soil maps	Estimation of spatio-temporal change of soil is needed for various purposes. Commonly used methods for the estimation have some shortcomings. To estimate spatio-temporal change of soil organic matter (SOM) in Jiangsu province, China, this study explored benefits of digital soil maps (DSM) by handling mapping uncertainty using stochastic simulation. First, SOM maps on different dates, the 1980s and 2006-2007, were constructed using robust geostatistical methods. Then, sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) was used to generate 500 realizations of SOM in the area for the two dates. Finally, E-type (i.e. conditional mean) temporal change of SOM and its associated uncertainty, probability and confidence interval were computed. Results showed that SOM increased in 70% of Jiangsu province and decreased in the remaining 30% during the past decades. As a whole, SOM increased by 0.22% on average. Spatial variance of SOM diminished, but the major spatial pattern was retained. The maps of probability and confidence intervals for SOM change gave more detailed information and credibility about this change. Comparatively, variance of spatio-temporal change of SOM derived using SGS was much smaller than sum of separate kriging variances for the two dates, because of lower mapping variances derived using SGS. This suggests an advantage of the method based on digital soil maps with uncertainty dealt with using SGS for deriving spatio-temporal change in soil. © 2012 The Authors.

0038190735	Pedogenic evolution of paddy soils in different soil landscapes	Paddy soils are Hydragric Anthrosols and are an important soil resource for food production. They are widely distributed in China and Asia. Soils that can be used for paddy cultivation vary considerably but basically are grouped into three kinds of landscape, i.e., well-drained sloping uplands, alluvial plains with groundwater fluctuation, and poorly drained polder areas with a near-surface water table. Typical soil chronosequences were studied to clarify the pedogenic changes after wetland rice cultivation, especially in relation to management practices. All of them are in important rice production regions of China. The study focussed on redox condition and iron oxides dynamics. On alluvial plains, the soil conditions range from continuously reducing controlled by high groundwater to alternating reduction and oxidation because of artificial submergence and groundwater fluctuations. Artificially induced leaching losses, previously prevented by a high groundwater table, are partly compensated during paddy cultivation by the rejuvenation process of alluvial deposition. Soils on an older delta, which no longer receives river-sediments, are more strongly developed and showed a decrease of DCB-extractable iron in surface horizon of young paddy soils and more profoundly throughout the profile in old paddy soils. In the polder area, the apparent lowering of groundwater table by deposition of sediment has changed the soil hydrology and increased redox potential. With the better soil aeration, crystalline iron oxides and their ratio to total iron increase with cultivation age. On well-drained terraces, the change of soil moisture regime is overwhelming. Previously well-aerated upland soils are periodically reduced, which accelerates leaching and loss of iron oxides from surface horizons, and probably clay decrease by lateral movement and ferrolysis processes superimposed on the difference of parent soils. An iron-enriched subsurface horizon has formed rapidly and it is a diagnostic feature of this type of paddy soil. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

84866346462	Spatial agricultural soil quality evaluation based on digital soil maps and uncertainty analysis	Soil quality information is used for managing soil resources. This study evaluated the soil quality for agricultural lands of Hong Kong and analyzed its associated uncertainty. First, spatially correlated soil quality indicators were mapped using geostatistical tools, while spatially uncorrelated indicators were mapped by combining soil series means and inverse distance-weighted residuals from the means. Then, the correlated indicators were simulated using stochastic simulation and values of the uncorrelated indicators were randomly generated based on the statistical characteristics of a soil series. Results showed that the agricultural soil quality of this study area was moderate, with an average index value of 0.68. The produced soil quality information contained moderate uncertainty and was credible with a confidence level above 0.90 on most of the area, given the derived uncertainty. However, based on probability samples, the soil quality information was moderately accurate and the derived uncertainty actually was not so good. Efforts are needed to improve uncertainty characterization for digital soil quality assessment. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.

Soil classification based on Chinese Soil Taxonomy was determined through field observation and laboratory analysis. The dominant soil type was a Red Ferri-udic Cambosol where it alone was used as a calibration set (R) for prediction soil organic matter (SOM) and free iron content (FIC) using VNIR-DRS. A mixed set of soils were used as comparison group (T). The three data sets, R, T and R + T were used for spectral prediction analysis for SOM and FIC independently.

84872402739	Dealing with spatial outliers and mapping uncertainty for evaluating the effects of urbanization on soil: A case study of soil pH and particle fractions in Hong Kong	The effects of urbanization on soil have been accelerating around the globe and there is a need for these effects to be evaluated precisely. In order to do this, spatial outliers and mapping uncertainty should be handled properly. The present study aimed to deal with these two problems using a case study of soil pH and particle fractions (i.e., sand, silt and clay) in Hong Kong. Based on 133 topsoil samples collected in an urban and peri-urban mixed area of Hong Kong, robust estimators for spatial variogram were first adopted with a procedure for identifying spatial outliers to remove spatial outliers. Then, 1000 models were simulated for each soil property using the methods of maximum likelihood and Monte Carlo Markov Chain, in order to characterize parameter uncertainty. Finally, 100 of the 1000 simulated models were randomly selected to construct soil maps using kriging, and the interpolation uncertainty was characterized using Sequential Gaussian Simulation, generating 1000 simulations for each model. Based on the total 100,000 simulated values at each location for each soil property, temporal variation of the soil property at the location across the past half century was derived against the soil series map established in 1960s for this area. Probability that soil property value changed after urbanization was also computed, in order to show if soil property has changed with a significant confidence. Results showed that the situation of spatial outliers in the soil data of the present study was not serious and mapping uncertainties were large. Temporal variations of soil pH and particle fractions obtained through comparison between soil maps of pre-urbanization and post-urbanization were not completely attributed to the effects of urbanization, but partially to mapping uncertainties. Urbanization in Hong Kong during the past half century influenced soil pH slightly and influenced soil particle fractions relatively strongly. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

In the present study, rates of weathering and soil formation on granite and their dependences on acid precipitation were studied in a small forested watershed, Fengxingzhuang (FXZ), in subtropical China using geochemical mass balance equations and multiple regression analysis. Atmospheric input from wet and dry deposition, and stream output through runoff were monitored from March, 2007 to February, 2010.

84880732736	Mapping the three-dimensional distribution of soil organic matter across a subtropical hilly landscape	There is a serious lack of detailed and accurate three-dimensional soil distribution information worldwide. This study examined the effectiveness of combining radial basis function (RBF) neural networks and profile depth functions to map the three-dimensional distribution of soil organic matter (SOM) in a subtropical hilly landscape in southern Anhui Province, China. The RBF networks were used to predict the lateral distribution of SOM based on its relations with terrain attributes and land uses, while the depth functions were used to fit its vertical distribution based on sparse measurements of SOM in soil genetic horizons. Compared with power and logarithmic functions, the equal-area quadratic splines had smaller bias, higher accuracy, and more stable performance in fitting the vertical SOM distribution. The prediction accuracy of the whole three-dimensional mapping method decreased with depth within the upper 60 cm, while the best accuracy occurred below 60 cm. In the upper 30 cm, areas with high elevation tended to have high predicted SOM content and vice versa. There were local deviations from this pattern in areas where toeslopes and ravines had higher predicted SOM content than backslopes, even though the latter are at higher elevations. Multiple regressions with dummy variables showed that the influence of terrain conditions on SOM content was strong in the upper 60 cm and weak below 60 cm, while that of land use was strong in the upper 30 cm and weak below 30 cm. Both influences were the strongest in the upper 15-cm soil layer. Under the same terrain conditions, agricultural cultivation is associated with SOM accumulation in the upper 30 cm. © Soil Science Society of America.

And furthermore, the variability of SOM in the surface layer (0-20 cm) of Jiangsu Province was analyzed; and its main factors, too, by means of variance analysis and regression analysis. The results show that the SOM content of the region varied in the range of (16.55±8.49) g/kg, with a coefficient of variation of 51.36%, both belonging to a moderate level. SOM content of different types varies widely, with the maximum value of 31.60 g/kg in boggy soil, and with the minimum value of 8.69 g/kg in brown soil. The variation degree of SOM in natural soil was higher than that in cultivated soil. Analysis of variance suggests that mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), parent material, land use, soil texture and pH significantly affected the variability of SOM in Jiangsu Province. All these 6 natural factors can explain 52.6% variability of SOM. Soil texture and MAT are the main factors controlling variability of SOM. The effect of soil texture on SOM variation is stronger than that of MAT, and two factors can independently explain about 32.0% and 23.4% variability of SOM, respectively.

The results showed that red clays in TX, LYZ and SSW were fine and uniform, with no > 2 mm gravels and little > 63 μm fraction. They had a high content of 10-50 μm fraction, so-called "basic dust fraction", and showed unimodal distributions, which were very comparable to those of the Xiashu Loess in southeastern China and the loess in North China. All these features reflected marked aeolian characteristics of the red clays in these areas. Red clays in XQ and QJ were much coarser than those in TX, LYZ and SSW, with high contents of > 63 μm fraction and even containing > 2 mm gravels in some layers. The grain size distribution patterns showed significantly progressive trends from the lower profile to the upmost layer and could not be compared with those of the loess in North China or the Xiashu Loess, implying they might be derived from underlying parent rocks and had some inherited properties from bedrock. Red clays in HHT had high contents of > 63 μm fraction and contain many > 2 mm gravels in each layer. The grain size frequency curves showed multiple-peaks and some abrupt variations were also observed on the profile, revealing its alluvial or diluvial origin in HHT. The multiple origins of red clays reflected the diversity and complexity of the Quaternary environment in South China. It can be concluded that grain size is an effective proxy indicator for the origin of most deposits. © 2013 Soil Science Society of China.

Regional differences exist in crop limitations, such as typhoon risk, low temperatures, poor soil fertility, and drought. In this study a crop zonation was made for a range of crops, among which is banana, as a way to: 1) establish areas for potential expansion for banana, and 2) identify limitations and options for crop and land management. A spatial soil and terrain database of Hainan Island (1:250 000) was linked to the automated land evaluation system (ALES).

Land use has an important impact on agricultural non-point sources (NFS) nitrogen discharge. This study on quantitative relationship of runoff nitrogen discharge and land use was conducted in Meicun watershed of Xuancheng County, Anhui Province, in the subtropical low hill area, by the dynamic monitoring of stream water and nutrient discharge, integrating interpretation of aerial image and GIS analysis. The results showed that, land use significantly affect nitrogen concentration and discharge in which nitrate nitrogen was the main component. There was a significant linear relationship between nitrate and total nitrogen concentration in the given land use system. However, statistically significant relationship between ammonium and total nitrogen concentration was found only in forest-pond system. Moreover, positive linear relationship existed between different forms of nitrogen discharge. It was found that there were exponential relationship between the discharge of nitrate, ammonium and total nitrogen and the area percentages of forest, pond, paddy and village. Forest and pond had a negative impact on nitrogen discharge while the paddy and village had positive effect. At the same time, land use types had important effect on nitrogen concentration.

The results showed that in the tropical rubber farm, soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and total organic C (TOC) were relatively low in the content but highly correlated with each other. After rubber tapping, soil MBC of mature rubber fields decreased significantly, by 55.5%, compared with immature rubber fields. Soil TOC also decreased but the difference was not significant. Ratios of MBC to TOC decreased significantly. The decreasing trend of MBC stopped at about ten years of rubber cultivation. After this period, soil MBC increased relatively while soil TOC still kept in decreasing. Soil MBC changes could be measured to predict the tendency of soil organic matter changes due to management practices in a tropical rubber farm several years before the changes in soil TOC become detectable.

84892837421	Prediction of soil organic matter and cation exchange capacity based on spectral similarity measuring	The potential of visible-near infrared (vis-NIR, 350~2500 nm) laboratory spectroscopy for the estimation of soil properties has been previously demonstrated in the literature. Spectroscopy is rapid, inexpensive, and non-destructive. A single spectrum allows for the simultaneous characterization of various soil properties. The question that always arises when two samples are close in spectral space is whether they are close in terms of soil composition. This paper explores three different approaches to improving prediction accuracy. The first, called the SAM Approach, predicts soil properties via similar soil spectra using a spectral angle mapper (SAM). The second one, called the PLSR Approach, predicts soil properties using partial least-squares regression (PLSR). The third, called the SAM-PLSR Approach, first uses the SAM to choose similar soil spectra, which are then used as calibration samples for the PLSR. These tests were performed on a collection of 400 soil samples from 91 profiles from the Xuancheng region of the Anhui Province. Spectra data include reflectance (R), first derivatives of reflectance (FDR), and the logarithm of the inverse of the reflectance (Log (1/R)). The aims of the work were threefold: (1) to investigate the relationship between soil vis-NIR similarity and soil attribute similarity (soil organic matter (SOM) and cation exchange capacity (CEC)) using a spectral angle mapper (SAM); (2) to predict soil properties by PLSR with different calibration samples, which were independently validated; (3) to compare the accuracy of predictions from the SAM Approach, PLSR Approach, and SAM-PLSR Approach. This study showed that soil vis-NIR similarity reflected the similarity of SOM and CEC content, the SAM Approach can be directly used to predict the content of SOM (R

84891760346	Mapping soil organic matter in low-relief areas based on land surface diurnal temperature difference and a vegetation index	Accurate estimates of the spatial variability of soil organic matter (SOM) are necessary to properly evaluate soil fertility and soil carbon sequestration potential. In plains and gently undulating terrains, soil spatial variability is not closely related to relief, and thus digital soil mapping (DSM) methods based on soil-landscape relationships often fail in these areas. Therefore, different predictors are needed for DSM in the plains. Time-series remotely sensed data, including thermal imagery and vegetation indices provide possibilities for mapping SOM in such areas. Two low-relief agricultural areas (Peixian County, 28 km × 28 km and Jiangyan County, 38 km × 50 km) in northwest and middle Jiangsu Province, east China, were chosen as case study areas. Land surface diurnal temperature difference (DTD) extracted from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST), and soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) at the peak of growing season calculated from Landsat ETM+ image were used as predictors. Regression kriging (RK) with a mixed linear model fitted by residual maximum likelihood (REML) and residuals interpolated by simple kriging (SK) were used to model and map SOM spatial distribution; ordinary kriging (OK) was used as a baseline comparison. The root mean squared error, mean error and mean absolute error calculated from leave-one-out cross-validation were used to assess prediction accuracy. Results showed that the proposed covariates provided added value to the observations. SAVI aggregated to MODIS resolution was able to identify local highs and lows not apparent from the DTD imagery alone. Despite the apparent similarity of the two areas, the spatial structure of residuals from the linear mixed models were quite different; ranges on the order of 3 km in Jiangyan but 16 km in Peixian, and accuracy of best models differed by a factor of two (3.3 g/kg and 6.3 g/kg SOM, respectively). This suggests that time-series remotely sensed data can provide useful auxiliary variable for mapping SOM in low-relief agricultural areas, with three important cautions: (1) image dates must be carefully chosen; (2) vegetation indices should supplement diurnal temperature differences, (3) model structure must be calibrated for each area. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84896834231	GlobalSoilMap. Toward a Fine-Resolution Global Grid of Soil Properties	Soil scientists are being challenged to provide assessments of soil condition from local through to global scales. A particular issue is the need for estimates of the stores and fluxes in soils of water, carbon, nutrients, and solutes. This review outlines progress in the development and testing of GlobalSoilMap-a digital soil map that aims to provide a fine-resolution global grid of soil functional properties with estimates of their associated uncertainties. A range of methods can be used to generate the fine-resolution spatial estimates depending on the availability of existing soil surveys, environmental data, and point observations. The system has an explicit geometry for estimating point and block estimates of soil properties continuously down the soil profile. This geometry is necessary to ensure mass balance when stores and fluxes are computed. It also overcomes some limitations with existing systems for characterizing soil variation with depth. GlobalSoilMap has been designed to enable delivery of soil data via Web services. This review provides an overview of the system's technical specifications including the minimum data set. Examples from contrasting countries and environments are then presented to demonstrate the robustness of the technical specifications. GlobalSoilMap provides the means for supplying soil information in a format and resolution compatible with other fundamental data sets from remote sensing, terrain analysis, and other systems for mapping, monitoring, and forecasting biophysical processes. The initial research phase of the core project is nearing completion and attention is now shifting toward establishing the institutional and governance arrangements necessary to complete a full global coverage and maintaining the operational version of the GlobalSoilMap. This will be a grand and rewarding challenge for the soil science profession in the coming years. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84900413122	Mapping Soil Particle Size Fractions Using Compositional Kriging, Cokriging and Additive Log-ratio Cokriging in Two Case Studies	Information on the spatial distribution of soil particle-size fractions (psf) is required for a wide range of applications. Geostatistics is often used to map spatial distribution from point observations; however, for compositional data such as soil psf, conventional multivariate geostatistics are not optimal. Several solutions have been proposed, including compositional kriging and transformation to a composition followed by cokriging. These have been shown to perform differently in different situations, so that there is no procedure to choose an optimal method. To address this, two case studies of soil psf mapping were carried out using compositional kriging, log-ratio cokriging, cokriging, and additive log-ratio cokriging; and the performance of Mahalanobis distance as a criterion for choosing an optimal mapping method was tested. All methods generated very similar results. However, the compositional kriging and cokriging results were slightly more similar to each other than to the other pair, as were log-ratio cokriging and additive log-ratio cokriging. The similar results of the two methods within each pair were due to similarities of the methods themselves, for example, the same variogram models and prediction techniques, and the similar results between the two pairs were due to the mathematical relationship between original and log-ratio transformed data. Mahalanobis distance did not prove to be a good indicator for selecting an optimal method to map soil psf. © 2014 International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.

The results indicate that strong acid environment and organic matter (OM) can remarkably improve the transfer of insoluble elements. Among all the elements, Th is the least mobile. As for the general conservative elements during incipient chemical weathering, such as Ti, Zr, Hf and Nb, the removals are up to 30%-40% in the upper profile. And for Fe, Al, Cu and Ni, that tend to be combined with secondary minerals and to be retained in temperate zone, they are removed from the upper profile, transferred downwards, and then precipitated in the lower profile. In addition, atmospheric inputs, including sea salt aerosols and dust, have a profound effect on the budgets of elements that are susceptible to leaching losses (e.g. K, Na and Sr). Excluding the possibilities of groundwater and erosion, the remarkable increase of K, Na and Sr concentrations in the upper profile, together with dramatically upward increasing trends of the percentage changes of Sr/Th, K/Th and Na/Th ratios, show that atmospheric inputs, especially sea salt aerosols, contribute much extraneous seawater derived elements, such as K, Na and Sr to the soils. The overall elemental behaviors in this profile suggest that organic matter and atmospheric inputs play a very important role in the mobilization and redistribution of elements during extreme weathering in tropical regions. © 2014 Science Press, Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84918795729	Organic matter controls of soil water retention in an alpine grassland and its significance for hydrological processes	Soil water retention influences many soil properties and soil hydrological processes. The alpine meadows and steppes of the Qilian Mountains on the northeast border of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau form the source area of the Heihe River, the second largest inland river in China. The soils of this area therefore have a large effect on water movement and storage of the entire watershed. In order to understand the controlling factors of soil water retention and how they affect regional eco-hydrological processes in an alpine grassland, thirty-five pedogenic horizons in fourteen soil profiles along two facing hillslopes in typical watersheds of this area were selected for study. Results show that the extensively-accumulated soil organic matter plays a dominant role in controlling soil water retention in this alpine environment. We distinguished two mechanisms of this control. First, at high matric potentials soil organic matter affected soil water retention mainly through altering soil structural parameters and thereby soil bulk density. Second, at low matric potentials the water adsorbing capacity of soil organic matter directly affected water retention. To investigate the hydrological functions of soils at larger scales, soil water retention was compared by three generalized pedogenic horizons. Among these soil horizons, the mattic A horizon, a diagnostic surface horizon of Chinese Soil Taxonomy defined specially for alpine meadow soils, had the greatest soil water retention over the entire range of measured matric potentials. Hillslopes with soils having these horizons are expected to have low surface runoff. This study promotes the understanding of the critical role of alpine soils, especially the vegetated surface soils in controlling the eco-hydrological processes in source regions of the Heihe River watershed.

13644269700	Chemical criteria to assess risk of phosphorus leaching from urban soils	Soils from urban and suburban areas are normally enriched with phosphorus (P). Sixteen urban soils with a wide range of total P concentrations under typical urban land uses were sampled and analyzed for extractable P concentrations using water, sodium bicarbonate and citric acid. Meanwhile the soils were artificially leached in columns and P concentrations in the leachates were determined. With linear regression a two-stage linear relationship was found to exist between concentrations of P in the leachates and soil P contents obtained by various chemical measurements, i.e., there was a "change-point" denoting the critical threshold value for extractable P between the regression lines, above which concentrations of P in leachates increased substantially. These threshold "change-point" values were 1.5 mg kg

84921936175	Pedogenetic evolution of clay minerals and agricultural implications in three paddy soil chronosequences of south China derived from different parent materials	Purpose: This study aims to understand how clay minerals change sequentially with paddy cultivation age and how parent materials (or original soils) affect the clay mineral behavior of paddy soils. Materials and methods: Three paddy soil chronosequences in the hilly regions of South China, derived from purple sandy shale (PS), Quaternary red clays (RC), and red sandstone (RS), were selected to explore the dynamic changes in clay mineralogy, by comparing physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties of soil sequences. Results and discussion: For RC and RS soils, both of which have a low K content, there was little change in the clay minerals. Long-term paddy cultivation can promote formation of illite-like minerals; however, this form of K storage was limited under present farming conditions. In PS soils, which are abundant in K-bearing minerals, the depotassication was strong, accompanied by marked transformation of clay minerals. Kaolinite-like minerals gradually decreased with paddy cultivation age; by contrast, derivative clay minerals such as secondary chlorite and halloysite gradually increased. Strong depotassication mainly occurred in the nonclay fractions. The rate of depotassication and the generation of clay fractions were much faster than in natural soils. Conclusions: The clay minerals of paddy soils mainly followed the feature of their original soils. Their evolutions could be distinguished based on their constituents, which are greatly affected by their parent materials. Moreover, paddy cultivation is able to modify clay mineralogy, according to the original mineralogy and paddy soil management.
