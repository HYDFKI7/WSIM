21044433315	The PHOBOS perspective on discoveries at RHIC	This paper describes the conclusions that can be drawn from the data taken thus far with the PHOBOS detector at RHIC. In the most central Au + Au collisions at the highest beam energy, evidence is found for the formation of a very high energy density system whose description in terms of simple hadronic degrees of freedom is inappropriate. Furthermore, the constituents of this novel system are found to undergo a significant level of interaction. The properties of particle production at RHIC energies are shown to follow a number of simple scaling behaviors, some of which continue trends found at lower energies or in simpler systems. As a function of centrality, the total number of charged particles scales with the number of participating nucleons. When comparing Au + Au at different centralities, the dependence of the yield on the number of participants at higher p

28844463013	Centrality and pseudorapidity dependence of elliptic flow for charged hadrons in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	This Rapid Communication describes the measurement of elliptic flow for charged particles in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV using the PHOBOS detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The measured azimuthal anisotropy is presented over a wide range of pseudorapidity for three broad collision centrality classes for the first time at this energy. Two distinct methods of extracting the flow signal were used to reduce systematic uncertainties. The elliptic flow falls sharply with increasing |η| at 200 GeV for all the centralities studied, as observed for minimum-bias collisions at sNN=130 GeV. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

The longitudinal features of d+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV are found to be very similar to those seen in p+A collisions at lower energies. The total multiplicity of charged particles is found to scale with the total number of participants according to NchdAu=12N part Nchpp, and the energy dependence of the density of charged particles produced in the fragmentation region exhibits extended longitudinal scaling. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

33645292890	Transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of Hanbury-Brown-Twiss correlations in Au+Au collisions at sNN= 62.4 and 200 GeV	Two-particle correlations of identical charged pion pairs from Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 and 200 GeV were measured by the PHOBOS experiment at BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Data for the 15% most central events were analyzed with Bertsch-Pratt and Yano-Koonin-Podgoretskii parametrizations using pairs with rapidities of 0.4<yππ<1.3 and transverse momenta 0.1<kT<1.4 GeV/c. The Bertsch-Pratt radii Ro and R decrease as a function of pair transverse momentum. Ro and Rs are independent of collision energy, while R shows a slight increase. The source rapidity yYKP scales roughly with the pair rapidity yππ, indicating strong dynamical correlations. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33744550357	System size and centrality dependence of charged hadron transverse momentum spectra in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=62.4 and 200 GeV	We present transverse momentum distributions of charged hadrons produced in Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=62.4 and 200 GeV. The spectra are measured for transverse momenta of 0.25<pT<5.0GeV/c at sNN=62.4GeV and 0.25<pT<7.0GeV/c at sNN=200GeV, in a pseudorapidity range of 0.2<η<1.4. The nuclear modification factor RAA is calculated relative to p+p data at both collision energies as a function of collision centrality. At a given collision energy and fractional cross section, RAA is observed to be systematically larger in Cu+Cu collisions compared to Au+Au. However, for the same number of participating nucleons, RAA is essentially the same in both systems over the measured range of pT, in spite of the significantly different geometries of the Cu+Cu and Au+Au systems. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

These results are particularly valuable because of the extensive, continuous pseudorapidity coverage of the PHOBOS detector. There is no significant indication of structure near midrapidity and the data surprisingly exhibit extended longitudinal scaling similar to that seen for elliptic flow and charged particle pseudorapidity density. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The PHOBOS detector is used to measure integrated multiplicities in bins centered at η, defined within |η|<3, and covering intervals Δη. The variance σC2 of a suitably defined forward-backward asymmetry variable C is calculated as a function of η,Δη, and centrality. It is found to be sensitive to short-range correlations, and the concept of "clustering" is used to interpret comparisons to phenomenological models. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33747686077	Centrality and energy dependence of charged-particle multiplicities in heavy ion collisions in the context of elementary reactions	The PHOBOS experiment at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured the total multiplicity of primary charged particles as a function of collision centrality in Au+Au collisions at sNN= 19.6, 130, and 200 GeV. An approximate independence of Nch Npart/2 on the number of participating nucleons is observed, reminiscent of "wounded nucleon" scaling (Nch Npart) observed in proton-nucleus collisions. Unlike p+A, the constant of proportionality does not seem to be set by the pp/p̄p data at the same energy. Rather, there seems to be a surprising correspondence with the total multiplicity measured in e+e- annihilations, as well as the rapidity shape measured over a large range. The energy dependence of the integrated multiplicity per participant pair shows that e+e- and A+A data agree over a large range of center-of-mass energies (s>20 GeV), and pp/p̄p data can be brought to agree approximately with the e+e- data by correcting for the typical energy taken away by leading particles. This is suggestive of a mechanism for soft particle production that depends mainly on the amount of available energy. It is conjectured that the dominant distinction between A+A and p+p collisions is the multiple collisions per participant, which appears to be sufficient to substantially reduce the energy taken away by leading particles. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33747145142	Charged-particle pseudorapidity distributions in Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 GeV	The charged-particle pseudorapidity density for Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 GeV has been measured over a wide range of impact parameters and compared to results obtained at other energies. As a function of collision energy, the pseudorapidity distribution grows systematically both in height and width. The midrapidity density is found to grow approximately logarithmically between BNL Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) energies and the top BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) energy. There is also an approximate factorization of the centrality and energy dependence of the midrapidity yields. The new results at sNN=62.4 GeV confirm the previously observed phenomenon of "extended longitudinal scaling" in the pseudorapidity distributions when viewed in the rest frame of one of the colliding nuclei. It is also found that the evolution of the shape of the distribution with centrality is energy independent, when viewed in this reference frame. As a function of centrality, the total charged particle multiplicity scales linearly with the number of participant pairs as it was observed at other energies. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The data are compared to Cu+Cu, p+p and d+Au collisions at corresponding energies and centralities.

Two independent methods have been used to determine the heavy-flavor yields, and the results are in good agreement with each other. A fixed-order-plus-next-to-leading-log perturbative QCD calculation agrees with the data within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties, with the data/theory ratio of 1.71±0.02stat±0.18sys for 0.3<pT<9GeV/c.

33847340645	Identified hadron transverse momentum spectra in Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 GeV	Transverse momentum spectra of pions, kaons, protons, and antiprotons from Au+Au collisions at sNN = 62.4 GeV have been measured by the PHOBOS experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The identification of particles relies on three different methods: low momentum particles stopping in the first detector layers; the specific energy loss (dE/dx) in the silicon spectrometer, and time-of-flight measurement. These methods cover the transverse momentum ranges 0.03-0.2, 0.2-1.0, and 0.5-3.0 GeV/c, respectively. Baryons are found to have substantially harder transverse momentum spectra than mesons. The pT region in which the proton to pion ratio reaches unity in central Au+Au collisions at sNN = 62.4 GeV fits into a smooth trend as a function of collision energy. At low transverse mass, the spectra of various species exhibit a significant deviation from transverse mass scaling. The observed particle yields at very low pT are comparable to extrapolations from higher pT for kaons, protons and antiprotons. By comparing our results to Au+Au collisions at sNN = 200 GeV, we conclude that the net proton yield at midrapidity is proportional to the number of participant nucleons in the collision. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

33947372938	Recent results from phobos	The PHOBOS detector is one of four heavy ion experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In this paper we will review some of the results of PHOBOS from the data collected in p+p, d+Au and Au+Au collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energies up to 200 GeV. Evidence is found of the formation of a very high energy density and highly interactive system, which can not be described in terms of hadrons, and has a relatively low baryon density. There is evidence that the system formed is thermalized to a certain degree. Scaling with the number of participants and extended longitudinal scaling behavior are also observed in distributions of produced charged particles. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

Convincing evidence is found that we have created a state of matter with high energy-density, that is nearly net-baryon free and is strongly interacting. The data are found to exhibit "simple" scaling behaviors, which include extended longitudinal scaling and scaling with the number of participating nucleons. The Au+Au collision charged particle data also exhibit a remarkable factorization of collision energy and geometry. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.

34247106189	Scaling properties of azimuthal anisotropy in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200GeV	Differential measurements of elliptic flow (v2) for Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200GeV are used to test and validate predictions from perfect fluid hydrodynamics for scaling of v2 with eccentricity, system size, and transverse kinetic energy (KET). For KETmT-m up to ∼1GeV the scaling is compatible with hydrodynamic expansion of a thermalized fluid. For large values of KET mesons and baryons scale separately. Quark number scaling reveals a universal scaling of v2 for both mesons and baryons over the full KET range for Au+Au. For Au+Au and Cu+Cu the scaling is more pronounced in terms of KET, rather than transverse momentum. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34547244755	System size, energy, pseudorapidity, and centrality dependence of elliptic flow	This Letter presents measurements of the elliptic flow of charged particles as a function of pseudorapidity and centrality from Cu-Cu collisions at 62.4 and 200 GeV using the PHOBOS detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The elliptic flow in Cu-Cu collisions is found to be significant even for the most central events. For comparison with the Au-Au results, it is found that the detailed way in which the collision geometry (eccentricity) is estimated is of critical importance when scaling out system-size effects. A new form of eccentricity, called the participant eccentricity, is introduced which yields a scaled elliptic flow in the Cu-Cu system that has the same relative magnitude and qualitative features as that in the Au-Au system. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The away-side dijet induced azimuthal correlation is broadened, non-Gaussian, and peaked away from Δ =π in central and semicentral collisions in all the systems. The broadening and peak location are found to depend upon the number of participants in the collision, but not on the collision energy or beam nuclei. These results are consistent with sound or shock wave models, but pose challenges to Cherenkov gluon radiation models. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The PHOBOS experiment at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has a uniquely large coverage for charged particles, giving the opportunity to explore the correlations at both short- and long-range scales. At both energies, a complex two-dimensional correlation structure in Δη and Δ is observed. In the context of an independent cluster model of short-range correlations, the cluster size and its decay width are extracted from the two-particle pseudorapidity correlation function and compared with previous measurements in proton-proton and proton-antiproton collisions, as well as PYTHIA and HIJING predictions. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34848889574	Inclusive cross section and double helicity asymmetry for π0 production in p+p collisions at s=200GeV: Implications for the polarized gluon distribution in the proton	The PHENIX experiment presents results from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider 2005 run with polarized proton collisions at s=200GeV, for inclusive π0 production at midrapidity. Unpolarized cross section results are given for transverse momenta pT=0.5 to 20GeV/c, extending the range of published data to both lower and higher pT. The cross section is described well for pT<1GeV/c by an exponential in pT, and, for pT>2GeV/c, by perturbative QCD. Double helicity asymmetries ALL are presented based on a factor of 5 improvement in uncertainties as compared to previously published results, due to both an improved beam polarization of 50%, and to higher integrated luminosity. These measurements are sensitive to the gluon polarization in the proton. Using one representative model of gluon polarization it is demonstrated that the gluon spin contribution to the proton spin is significantly constrained. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

38049091925	Transverse momentum and centrality dependence of dihadron correlations in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV: Jet quenching and the response of partonic matter	Azimuthal angle (Δ) correlations are presented for charged hadrons from dijets for 0.4<pT<10 GeV/c in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. With increasing pT, the away-side distribution evolves from a broad and relatively flat shape to a concave shape, then to a convex shape. Comparisons to p+p data suggest that the away-side can be divided into a partially suppressed "head" region centered at Δ∼π and an enhanced "shoulder" region centered at Δ∼π±1.1. The pT spectrum for the head region softens toward central collisions, consistent with the onset of jet quenching. The spectral slope for the shoulder region is independent of centrality and trigger pT, which offers constraints on energy transport mechanisms and suggests that it contains the medium response to energetic jets. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

34247400755	Energy loss and flow of heavy quarks in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	The PHENIX experiment at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has measured electrons with 0.3<pT<9GeV/c at midrapidity (|y|<0.35) from heavy-flavor (charm and bottom) decays in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV. The nuclear modification factor RAA relative to p+p collisions shows a strong suppression in central Au+Au collisions, indicating substantial energy loss of heavy quarks in the medium produced at RHIC energies. A large azimuthal anisotropy v2 with respect to the reaction plane is observed for 0.5<pT<5GeV/c indicating substantial heavy-flavor elliptic flow. Both RAA and v2 show a pT dependence different from those of neutral pions. A comparison to transport models which simultaneously describe RAA(pT) and v2(pT) suggests that the viscosity to entropy density ratio is close to the conjectured quantum lower bound, i.e., near a perfect fluid. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

41249103994	Cold nuclear matter effects on J/ψ production as constrained by deuteron-gold measurements at sNN=200 GeV	We present a new analysis of J/ψ production yields in deuteron-gold collisions at sNN=200 GeV using data taken from the PHENIX experiment in 2003 and previously published in S. S. Adler [Phys. Rev. Lett 96, 012304 (2006)]. The high statistics proton-proton J/ψ data taken in 2005 are used to improve the baseline measurement and thus construct updated cold nuclear matter modification factors (RdAu). A suppression of J/ψ in cold nuclear matter is observed as one goes forward in rapidity (in the deuteron-going direction), corresponding to a region more sensitive to initial-state low-x gluons in the gold nucleus. The measured nuclear modification factors are compared to theoretical calculations of nuclear shadowing to which a J/ψ (or precursor) breakup cross section is added. Breakup cross sections of σbreakup=2.8-1. 4+1.7 (2.2-1.5+1.6) mb are obtained by fitting these calculations to the data using two different models of nuclear shadowing. These breakup cross-section values are consistent within large uncertainties with the 4.2±0.5 mb determined at lower collision energies. Projecting this range of cold nuclear matter effects to copper-copper and gold-gold collisions reveals that the current constraints are not sufficient to firmly quantify the additional hot nuclear matter effect. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

This study focuses on the extraction of the double-helicity asymmetry in η production (p→+p→→η+X), the η cross section, and the η/π0 cross section ratio.

84908160199	System-size dependence of open-heavy-flavor production in nucleus-nucleus collisions at sNN =200 GeV	The PHENIX Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured open-heavy-flavor production in Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200 GeV through the measurement of electrons at midrapidity that originate from semileptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons. In peripheral Cu+Cu collisions an enhanced production of electrons is observed relative to p+p collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions. In the transverse momentum range from 1 to 5 GeV/c the nuclear modification factor is RAA∼1.4. As the system size increases to more central Cu+Cu collisions, the enhancement gradually disappears and turns into a suppression. For pT>3 GeV/c, the suppression reaches RAA∼0.8 in the most central collisions. The pT and centrality dependence of RAA in Cu+Cu collisions agree quantitatively with RAA in d+Au and Au+Au collisions, if compared at a similar number of participating nucleons.

84908179316	Centrality categorization for Rp(d)+A in high-energy collisions	High-energy proton- and deuteron-nucleus collisions provide an excellent tool for studying a wide array of physics effects, including modifications of parton distribution functions in nuclei, gluon saturation, and color neutralization and hadronization in a nuclear environment, among others. All of these effects are expected to have a significant dependence on the size of the nuclear target and the impact parameter of the collision, also known as the collision centrality. In this article, we detail a method for determining centrality classes in p(d)+A collisions via cuts on the multiplicity at backward rapidity (i.e., the nucleus-going direction) and for determining systematic uncertainties in this procedure. For d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV we find that the connection to geometry is confirmed by measuring the fraction of events in which a neutron from the deuteron does not interact with the nucleus. As an application, we consider the nuclear modification factors Rp(d)+A, for which there is a bias in the measured centrality-dependent yields owing to auto correlations between the process of interest and the backward-rapidity multiplicity. We determine the bias-correction factors within this framework. This method is further tested using the hijing Monte Carlo generator. We find that for d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV, these bias corrections are small and vary by less than 5% (10%) up to pT=10 (20) GeV/c. In contrast, for p+Pb collisions at sNN=5.02 TeV we find that these bias factors are an order of magnitude larger and strongly pT dependent, likely attributable to the larger effect of multiparton interactions.

The measured cross section for 0.5<pT<5.0GeV/c and 3.0<|η|<3.8 is well described by a next-to-leading-order perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics calculation. The asymmetries AN have been measured as a function of Feynman-x (xF) from 0.2<|xF|<0.7, as well as transverse momentum (pT) from 1.0<pT<4.5GeV/c. The asymmetry averaged over positive xF is 〈AN〉=0.061±0.014. The results are consistent with prior transverse single-spin measurements of forward η and π0 mesons at various energies in overlapping xF ranges. Comparison of different particle species can help to determine the origin of the large observed asymmetries in p↑+p collisions.

No strong dependence on centrality is observed. For the p̄/p ratio at pT≈0.51 GeV/c, we observe an average value of 0.50±0.003(stat)±0.04(syst) and 0.77±0.008(stat)±0.05(syst) for the 10% most central collisions of 62.4 and 200 GeV Cu+Cu, respectively. The values for all three particle species measured at sNN=200 GeV are in agreement within systematic uncertainties with that seen in both heavier and lighter systems measured at the same RHIC energy. This indicates that system size does not appear to play a strong role in determining the midrapidity chemical freeze-out properties affecting the antiparticle to particle ratios of the three most abundant particle species produced in these collisions. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

46349083491	Quantitative constraints on the transport properties of hot partonic matter from semi-inclusive single high transverse momentum pion suppression in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	The PHENIX experiment has measured the suppression of semi-inclusive single high-transverse-momentum π0's in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The present understanding of this suppression is in terms of energy loss of the parent (fragmenting) parton in a dense color-charge medium. We have performed a quantitative comparison between various parton energy-loss models and our experimental data. The statistical point-to-point uncorrelated as well as correlated systematic uncertainties are taken into account in the comparison. We detail this methodology and the resulting constraint on the model parameters, such as the initial color-charge density dNg/dy, the medium transport coefficient q, or the initial energy-loss parameter ε0. We find that high-transverse-momentum π0 suppression in Au+Au collisions has sufficient precision to constrain these model-dependent parameters at the ±20-25% (one standard deviation) level. These constraints include only the experimental uncertainties, and further studies are needed to compute the corresponding theoretical uncertainties. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

47149098083	Dihadron azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	Azimuthal angle (Δ) correlations are presented for a broad range of transverse momentum (0.4<pT<10 GeV/c) and centrality (0-92%) selections for charged hadrons from dijets in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. With increasing pT, the away-side Δ distribution evolves from a broad and relatively flat shape to a concave shape, then to a convex shape. Comparisons with p+p data suggest that the away-side distribution can be divided into a partially suppressed "head" region centered at Δ~π, and an enhanced "shoulder" region centered at Δ~π±1.1. The pT spectrum for the associated hadrons in the head region softens toward central collisions. The spectral slope for the shoulder region is independent of centrality and trigger pT. The properties of the near-side distributions are also modified relative to those in p+p collisions, reflected by the broadening of the jet shape in Δ and Δη, and an enhancement of the per-trigger yield. However, these modifications seem to be limited to pT4 GeV/c, above which both the hadron pair shape and per-trigger yield become similar to p+p collisions. These observations suggest that both the away- and near-side distributions contain a jet fragmentation component which dominates for pT5 GeV/c and a medium-induced component which is important for pT4 GeV/c. We also quantify the role of jets at intermediate and low pT through the yield of jet-induced pairs in comparison with binary scaled p+p pair yield. The yield of jet-induced pairs is suppressed at high pair proxy energy (sum of the pT magnitudes of the two hadrons) and is enhanced at low pair proxy energy. The former is consistent with jet quenching; the latter is consistent with the enhancement of soft hadron pairs due to transport of lost energy to lower pT. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

Fluctuations are measured as a function of collision centrality, transverse momentum range, and charge sign. After correcting for nondynamical fluctuations due to fluctuations in the collision geometry within a centrality bin, the remaining dynamical fluctuations expressed as the variance normalized by the mean tend to decrease with increasing centrality. The dynamical fluctuations are consistent with or below the expectation from a superposition of participant nucleon-nucleon collisions based upon p+p data, indicating that this dataset does not exhibit evidence of critical behavior in terms of the compressibility of the system. A comparison of the data with a model where hadrons are independently emitted from a number of hadron clusters suggests that the mean number of hadrons per cluster is small in heavy ion collisions. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

57149119905	Suppression pattern of neutral pions at high transverse momentum in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV and constraints on medium transport coefficients	For Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV, we measure neutral pion production with good statistics for transverse momentum, pT, up to 20GeV/c. A fivefold suppression is found, which is essentially constant for 5<pT<20GeV/c. Experimental uncertainties are small enough to constrain any model-dependent parametrization for the transport coefficient of the medium, e.g., □□ in the parton quenching model. The spectral shape is similar for all collision classes, and the suppression does not saturate in Au+Au collisions. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

60349093226	Inclusive cross section and double helicity asymmetry for π0 production in p+p collisions at s=62.4GeV	The PHENIX experiment presents results from the RHIC 2006 run with polarized p+p collisions at s=62.4GeV, for inclusive π0 production at midrapidity. Unpolarized cross section results are measured for transverse momenta pT=0.5 to 7GeV/c. Next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations are compared with the data, and while the calculations are consistent with the measurements, next-to-leading logarithmic corrections improve the agreement. Double helicity asymmetries ALL are presented for pT=1 to 4GeV/c and probe the higher range of Bjorken x of the gluon (xg) with better statistical precision than our previous measurements at s=200GeV. These measurements are sensitive to the gluon polarization in the proton for 0.06<xg<0.4. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

64549151614	System size, energy, and centrality dependence of pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles in relativistic heavy-ion collisions	We present the first measurements of the pseudorapidity distribution of primary charged particles in Cu+Cu collisions as a function of collision centrality and energy, sNN=22.4, 62.4, and 200 GeV, over a wide range of pseudorapidity, using the PHOBOS detector. A comparison of Cu+Cu and Au+Au results shows that the total number of produced charged particles and the rough shape (height and width) of the pseudorapidity distributions are determined by the number of nucleon participants. More detailed studies reveal that a more precise matching of the shape of the Cu+Cu and Au+Au pseudorapidity distributions over the full range of pseudorapidity occurs for the same Npart/2A rather than the same Npart. In other words, it is the collision geometry rather than just the number of nucleon participants that drives the detailed shape of the pseudorapidity distribution and its centrality dependence at RHIC energies. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The inclusive yields of charged particles and comparisons between nuclear and elementary collisions already reveal a large amount of parton energy loss in the hot and dense medium created in heavy ion collisions. Remarkable scaling and factorization features are observed, unifying the data taken at various collision energies, centralities and nuclear sizes.

68749098511	Gluon-Spin contribution to the proton spin from the double-helicity asymmetry in inclusive π0 production in polarized p+p collisions at s=200GeV	The double helicity asymmetry in neutral pion production for pT=1 to 12GeV/c was measured with the PHENIX experiment to access the gluon-spin contribution, ΔG, to the proton spin. Measured asymmetries are consistent with zero, and at a theory scale of μ2=4GeV2 a next to leading order QCD analysis gives ΔG[0.02,0.3]=0.2, with a constraint of -0.7<ΔG[0. 02,0.3]<0.5 at Δχ2=9 (∼3σ) for the sampled gluon momentum fraction (x) range, 0.02 to 0.3. The results are obtained using predictions for the measured asymmetries generated from four representative fits to polarized deep inelastic scattering data. We also consider the dependence of the ΔG constraint on the choice of the theoretical scale, a dominant uncertainty in these predictions. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The ratio of the yield of electrons from bottom to that from charm is presented. The ratio is determined using partial D/D̄→e±K X (K unidentified) reconstruction. It is found that the yield of electrons from bottom becomes significant above 4GeV/c in pT. A fixed-order-plus-next-to-leading-log perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculation agrees with the data within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties.

68549101828	Scaling properties in bulk and pT-dependent particle production near midrapidity in relativistic heavy ion collisions	The centrality dependence of the midrapidity charged-particle multiplicity density (|η|<1) is presented for Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC over a broad range of collision energies. The multiplicity measured in the Cu+Cu system is found to be similar to that measured in the Au+Au system, for an equivalent Npart, with the observed factorization in energy and centrality still persistent in the smaller Cu+Cu system. The extent of the similarities observed for bulk particle production is tested by a comparative analysis of the inclusive transverse momentum distributions for Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions near midrapidity. It is found that, within the uncertainties of the data, the ratio of yields between the various energies for both Au+Au and Cu+Cu systems are similar and constant with centrality, both in the bulk yields and as a function of pT, up to at least 4 GeV/c. The effects of multiple nucleon collisions that strongly increase with centrality and energy appear to only play a minor role in bulk and intermediate transverse momentum particle production. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

70349124227	Photon-hadron jet correlations in p+p and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	We report the observation at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider of suppression of back-to-back correlations in the direct photon+jet channel in Au+Au relative to p+p collisions. Two-particle correlations of direct photon triggers with associated hadrons are obtained by statistical subtraction of the decay photon-hadron (γ-h) background. The initial momentum of the away-side parton is tightly constrained, because the parton-photon pair exactly balance in momentum at leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics, making such correlations a powerful probe of the in-medium parton energy loss. The away-side nuclear suppression factor, IAA, in central Au+Au collisions, is 0.32±0.12stat±0.09syst for hadrons of 3<pTh<5 in coincidence with photons of 5<pTγ<15 GeV/c. The suppression is comparable to that observed for high-pT single hadrons and dihadrons. The direct photon associated yields in p+p collisions scale approximately with the momentum balance, zT pTh/pTγ, as expected for a measurement of the away-side parton fragmentation function. We compare to Au+Au collisions for which the momentum balance dependence of the nuclear modification should be sensitive to the path-length dependence of parton energy loss. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

76649094927	High transverse momentum triggered correlations over a large pseudorapidity Acceptance in Au+Au Collisions at sNN=200GeV	A measurement of two-particle correlations with a high transverse momentum trigger particle (pTtrig>2.5GeV/c) is presented for Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV over the uniquely broad longitudinal acceptance of the PHOBOS detector (-4<Δη<2). A broadening of the away-side azimuthal correlation compared to elementary collisions is observed at all Δη. As in p+p collisions, the near side is characterized by a peak of correlated partners at small angle relative to the trigger particle. However, in central Au+Au collisions an additional correlation extended in Δη and known as the "ridge" is found to reach at least |Δη| ≈4. The ridge yield is largely independent of Δη over the measured range, and it decreases towards more peripheral collisions. For the chosen pTtrig cut, the ridge yield is consistent with zero for events with less than roughly 100 participating nucleons. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

77649125267	Double-helicity dependence of jet properties from dihadrons in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at √s=200GeV	It has been postulated that partonic orbital angular momentum can lead to a significant double-helicity dependence in the net transverse momentum of Drell-Yan dileptons produced in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions. Analogous effects are also expected for dijet production. If confirmed by experiment, this hypothesis, which is based on semiclassical arguments, could lead to a new approach for studying the contributions of orbital angular momentum to the proton spin. We report the first measurement of the double-helicity dependence of the dijet transverse momentum in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at √s=200GeV from data taken by the PHENIX experiment in 2005 and 2006. The analysis deduces the transverse momentum of the dijet from the widths of the near- and far-side peaks in the azimuthal correlation of the dihadrons. When averaged over the transverse momentum of the triggered particle, the difference of the root mean square of the dijet transverse momentum between like- and unlike-helicity collisions is found to be -37±88stat±14systMeV/c. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

77649218937	System size dependence of cluster properties from two-particle angular correlations in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at √sNN=200 GeV	We present results on two-particle angular correlations in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 200 GeV over a broad range of pseudorapidity (η) and azimuthal angle () values as a function of collision centrality. The PHOBOS detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has a uniquely large angular coverage for inclusive charged particles, which allows for the study of correlations on both long- and short-range scales. A complex two-dimensional correlation structure in Δη and Δ emerges, which is interpreted in the context of a cluster model. The effective cluster size and decay width are extracted from the two-particle pseudorapidity correlation functions. The effective cluster size found in semicentral Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions is comparable to that found in proton-proton collisions but a nontrivial decrease in size with increasing centrality is observed. Moreover, a comparison of results from Cu+Cu versus Au+Au collisions shows an interesting scaling of the effective cluster size with the measured fraction of total cross section (which is related to the ratio of the impact parameter to the nuclear radius, b/2R), suggesting a geometric origin. Further analysis for pairs from restricted azimuthal regions shows that the effective cluster size at Δ∼180° drops more rapidly toward central collisions than the size at Δ∼0°. The effect of limited η acceptance on the cluster parameters is also addressed, and a correction is applied to present cluster parameters for full η coverage, leading to much larger effective cluster sizes and widths than previously noted in the literature. These results should provide insight into the hot and dense medium created in heavy ion collisions. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

77950665344	Event-by-event fluctuations of azimuthal particle anisotropy in Au+Au collisions at √sNN=200GeV	This Letter presents the first measurement of event-by-event fluctuations of the elliptic flow parameter v2 in Au+Au collisions at √sNN=200GeV as a function of collision centrality. The relative nonstatistical fluctuations of the v2 parameter are found to be approximately 40%. The results, including contributions from event-by-event elliptic flow fluctuations and from azimuthal correlations that are unrelated to the reaction plane (nonflow correlations), establish an upper limit on the magnitude of underlying elliptic flow fluctuations. This limit is consistent with predictions based on spatial fluctuations of the participating nucleons in the initial nuclear overlap region. These results provide important constraints on models of the initial state and hydrodynamic evolution of relativistic heavy ion collisions. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

77950923946	Non-flow correlations and elliptic flow fluctuations in Au+Au collisions at √sNN=200 GeV	This article presents results on event-by-event elliptic flow fluctuations in Au+Au collisions at √sNN= 200 GeV, where the contribution from non-flow correlations has been subtracted. An analysis method is introduced to measure non-flow correlations, relying on the assumption that non-flow correlations are most prominent at short ranges (|Δη|<2). Assuming that non-flow correlations are of the order that is observed in p+p collisions for long-range correlations (|Δη|>2), relative elliptic flow fluctuations of approximately 30-40% are observed. These results are consistent with predictions based on spatial fluctuations of the participating nucleons in the initial nuclear overlap region. It is found that the long-range non-flow correlations in Au+Au collisions would have to be more than an order of magnitude stronger compared to the p+p data to lead to the observed azimuthal anisotropy fluctuations with no intrinsic elliptic flow fluctuations. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

77953741186	Transition in yield and azimuthal shape modification in dihadron correlations in relativistic heavy ion collisions	Hard-scattered parton probes produced in collisions of large nuclei indicate large partonic energy loss, possibly with collective produced-medium response to the lost energy. We present measurements of π0 trigger particles at transverse momenta pTt=4-12GeV/c and associated charged hadrons (pTa=0.5-7GeV/c) vs relative azimuthal angle Δφ in Au+Au and p+p collisions at √sNN=200GeV. The Au+Au distribution at low pTa, whose shape has been interpreted as a medium effect, is modified for pTt<7GeV/c. At higher pTt, the data are consistent with unmodified or very weakly modified shapes, even for the lowest measured pTa, which quantitatively challenges some medium response models. The associated yield of hadrons opposing the trigger particle in Au+Au relative to p+p (IAA) is suppressed at high pT (IAA ≈ 0.35-0.5), but less than for inclusive suppression (RAA ≈ 0.2). © 2010 The American Physical Society.

The J/ψ polarization is studied in the helicity, Gottfried-Jackson, and Collins-Soper frames for pT<5GeV/c and |y|<0.35. The polarization in the helicity and Gottfried-Jackson frames is consistent with zero for all transverse momenta, with a slight (1.8 sigma) trend towards longitudinal polarization for transverse momenta above 2GeV/c. No conclusion is allowed due to the limited acceptance in the Collins-Soper frame and the uncertainties of the current data. The results are compared to observations for other collision systems and center of mass energies and to different quarkonia production models. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

They indicate nuclear modification factors (RAA) which are similar in both magnitude and trend to those found in earlier π0 measurements. Linear fits to RAA as a function of pT in 5-20 GeV/c show that the slope is consistent with zero within two standard deviations at all centralities, although a slow rise cannot be excluded. Having different statistical and systematic uncertainties, the π0 and η measurements are complementary at high pT; thus, along with the extended pT range of these data they can provide additional constraints for theoretical modeling and the extraction of transport properties. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

77957597955	Azimuthal anisotropy of π0 production in Au+Au collisions at √sNN=200GeV: Path-length dependence of jet quenching and the role of initial geometry	We have measured the azimuthal anisotropy of π0 production for 1<pT<18GeV/c for Au+Au collisions at √sNN=200GeV. The observed anisotropy shows a gradual decrease for 3pT7-10GeV/c, but remains positive beyond 10GeV/c. The magnitude of this anisotropy is underpredicted, up to at least ∼10GeV/c, by current perturbative QCD (PQCD) energy-loss model calculations. An estimate of the increase in anisotropy expected from initial-geometry modification due to gluon saturation effects and fluctuations is insufficient to account for this discrepancy. Calculations that implement a path-length dependence steeper than what is implied by current PQCD energy-loss models show reasonable agreement with the data. ©2010 The American Physical Society.

78651268875	Measurement of transverse single-spin asymmetries for J/ψ production in polarized p+p collisions at √s=200GeV	We report the first measurement of transverse single-spin asymmetries in J/ψ production from transversely polarized p+p collisions at √s=200GeV with data taken by the PHENIX experiment in 2006 and 2008. The measurement was performed over the rapidity ranges 1.2<|y|<2.2 and |y|<0.35 for transverse momenta up to 6GeV/c. J/ψ production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider is dominated by processes involving initial-state gluons, and transverse single-spin asymmetries of the J/ψ can provide access to gluon dynamics within the nucleon. Such asymmetries may also shed light on the long-standing question in QCD of the J/ψ production mechanism. Asymmetries were obtained as a function of J/ψ transverse momentum and Feynman-x, with a value of -0.086±0.026stat±0.003syst in the forward region. This result suggests possible nonzero trigluon correlation functions in transversely polarized protons and, if well defined in this reaction, a nonzero gluon Sivers distribution function. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

79960913696	Azimuthal correlations of electrons from heavy-flavor decay with hadrons in p+p and Au+Au collisions at √s	Measurements of electrons from the decay of open-heavy-flavor mesons have shown that the yields are suppressed in Au+Au collisions compared to expectations from binary-scaled p+p collisions. These measurements indicate that charm and bottom quarks interact with the hot dense matter produced in heavy-ion collisions much more than expected. Here we extend these studies to two-particle correlations where one particle is an electron from the decay of a heavy-flavor meson and the other is a charged hadron from either the decay of the heavy meson or from jet fragmentation. These measurements provide more detailed information about the interactions between heavy quarks and the matter, such as whether the modification of the away-side-jet shape seen in hadron-hadron correlations is present when the trigger particle is from heavy-meson decay and whether the overall level of away-side-jet suppression is consistent. We statistically subtract correlations of electrons arising from background sources from the inclusive electron-hadron correlations and obtain two-particle azimuthal correlations at √s

Previous measurements of this quantity for hadrons with pT < 6 GeV/c indicate that the medium behaves like a nearly perfect fluid, while for pT > 6 GeV/c a reduced anisotropy is interpreted in terms of a path-length dependence for parton energy loss. In this measurement with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider we find that for pT > 4 GeV/c the anisotropy for direct photons is consistent with zero, as expected if the dominant source of direct photons is initial hard scattering. However, in the pT < 4 GeV/c region dominated by thermal photons, we find a substantial direct photon v<inf>2</inf> comparable to that of hadrons, whereas model calculations for thermal photons in this kinematic region significantly underpredict the observed v<inf>2</inf>.

0042824325	The PHOBOS detector at RHIC	This manuscript contains a detailed description of the PHOBOS experiment as it is configured for the Year 2001 running period. It is capable of detecting charged particles over the full solid angle using a multiplicity detector and measuring identified charged particles near mid-rapidity in two spectrometer arms with opposite magnetic fields. Both of these components utilize silicon pad detectors for charged particle detection. The minimization of material between the collision vertex and the first layers of silicon detectors allows for the detection of charged particles with very low transverse momenta, which is a unique feature of the PHOBOS experiment. Additional detectors include a time-of-flight wall which extends the particle identification range for one spectrometer arm, as well as sets of scintillator paddle and Cherenkov detector arrays for event triggering and centrality selection. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This overview shortly presents the most important features of the nucleus-nucleus collisions observed by the PHOBOS experiment, but concentrates on the most recent studies.

The extracted v2 coefficients are found to be consistent between the two meson species over the measured pT range. The ratio of v4/v22 for π0 mesons is found to be independent of pT for 1-9 GeV/c, implying a lack of sensitivity of the ratio to the change of underlying physics with pT. Furthermore, the ratio of v4/v22 is systematically larger in central collisions, which may reflect the combined effects of fluctuations in the initial collision geometry and finite viscosity in the evolving medium. © 2013 American Physical Society.

84898810279	Heavy-flavor electron-muon correlations in p+p and d+Au collisions at sNN =200 GeV	Background: Heavy-flavor modification in relativistic p(d)+A collisions are sensitive to different kinds of strong-interaction physics ranging from modifications of the nuclear wave function to initial- and final-state energy loss. Modifications to single heavy-flavor particles and their decay leptons at midrapidity and forward rapidity are well established at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Purpose: This paper presents measurements of azimuthal correlations of electron-muon pairs produced from heavy-flavor decays, primarily cc̄, in sNN=200 GeV p+p and d+Au collision using the PHENIX detector at RHIC. The electrons are measured at midrapidity while the muons in the pair are measured at forward rapidity, defined as the direction of the deuteron beam, in order to utilize the deuteron to probe low-x partons in the gold nucleus. Methods: This analysis uses the central spectrometer arms for electron identification and forward spectrometer arms for muon identification. Azimuthal correlations are built in all sign combinations for e-μ pairs. Subtracting the like-sign yield from the unlike-sign yield removes the correlations from light flavor decays and conversions. Results: Comparing the p+p results with several different Monte Carlo event generators, we find the results are consistent with a total charm cross section σcc̄=538±46 (stat) ± 197 (data syst) ± 174 (model syst) μb. These generators also indicate that the back-to-back peak at Δφ=π is dominantly from the leading-order contributions (gluon fusion), while higher-order processes (flavor excitation and gluon splitting) contribute to the yield at all Δφ. We observe a suppression in the pair yield per collision in d+Au. We find the pair yield suppression factor for 2.7<Δφ<3.2 rad is JdA=0.433±0.087 (stat) ± 0.135 (syst). Conclusions: The e-μ pairs result from partons at xAu∼10-2 at Q2=10 GeV/c2 at the edge of the shadowing region. The pair suppression indicates modification to cc̄ pairs for these kinematics in the cold nuclear medium at RHIC. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84903518309	Cold-nuclear-matter effects on heavy-quark production at forward and backward rapidity in d+Au collisions at sNN =200GeV	The PHENIX experiment has measured open heavy-flavor production via semileptonic decay over the transverse momentum range 1<pT<6GeV/c at forward and backward rapidity (1.4<|y|<2.0) in d+Au and p+p collisions at sNN=200GeV. In central d+Au collisions, relative to the yield in p+p collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, a suppression is observed at forward rapidity (in the d-going direction) and an enhancement at backward rapidity (in the Au-going direction). Predictions using nuclear-modified-parton-distribution functions, even with additional nuclear-pT broadening, cannot simultaneously reproduce the data at both rapidity ranges, which implies that these models are incomplete and suggests the possible importance of final-state interactions in the asymmetric d+Au collision system. These results can be used to probe cold-nuclear-matter effects, which may significantly affect heavy-quark production, in addition to helping constrain the magnitude of charmonia-breakup effects in nuclear matter. © 2014 American Physical Society.

Comparison of the π0 results with different theory expectations based on fits of other published data showed a preference for small positive values of gluon polarization, ΔG, in the proton in the probed Bjorken x range. The effect of adding the new 2009 π0 data to a recent global analysis of polarized scattering data is also shown, resulting in a best fit value ΔGDSSV[0.05,0.2]=0.06-0.15+0.11 in the range 0.05<x<0.2, with the uncertainty at Δχ2=9 when considering only statistical experimental uncertainties. Shifting the PHENIX data points by their systematic uncertainty leads to a variation of the best-fit value of ΔGDSSV[0.05,0.2] between 0.02 and 0.12, demonstrating the need for full treatment of the experimental systematic uncertainties in future global analyses. © 2014 American Physical Society.

A. ADARE et al.	Measurements of transverse-single-spin asymmetries (AN) in p+p collisions at s=62.4 and 200 GeV with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider are presented. At midrapidity, AN is measured for neutral pion and eta mesons reconstructed from diphoton decay, and, at forward rapidities, neutral pions are measured using both diphotons and electromagnetic clusters. The neutral-pion measurement of AN at midrapidity is consistent with zero with uncertainties a factor of 20 smaller than previous publications, which will lead to improved constraints on the gluon Sivers function. At higher rapidities, where the valence quark distributions are probed, the data exhibit sizable asymmetries. In comparison with previous measurements in this kinematic region, the new data extend the kinematic coverage in s and pT, and it is found that the asymmetries depend only weakly on s. The origin of the forward AN is presently not understood quantitatively. The extended reach to higher pT probes the transition between transverse momentum dependent effects at low pT and multiparton dynamics at high pT. © 2014 American Physical Society.

The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has performed a systematic study of KS0 and K∗0 meson production at midrapidity in p+p,d+Au, and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The KS0 and K∗0 mesons are reconstructed via their KS0→π0(→γγ)π0(→γγ) and K∗0→K±π decay modes, respectively. The measured transverse-momentum spectra are used to determine the nuclear modification factor of KS0 and K∗0 mesons in d+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at different centralities. In the d+Au collisions, the nuclear modification factor of KS0 and K∗0 mesons is almost constant as a function of transverse momentum and is consistent with unity, showing that cold-nuclear-matter effects do not play a significant role in the measured kinematic range. In Cu+Cu collisions, within the uncertainties no nuclear modification is registered in peripheral collisions. In central collisions, both mesons show suppression relative to the expectations from the p+p yield scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions in the Cu+Cu system. In the pT range 2-5 GeV/c, the strange mesons (KS0,K∗0) similarly to the φ meson with hidden strangeness, show an intermediate suppression between the more suppressed light quark mesons (π0) and the nonsuppressed baryons (p,p¯). At higher transverse momentum, pT>5 GeV/c, production of all particles is similarly suppressed by a factor of ≈2.

The nuclear modification of J/ψ yields in Cu+Au collisions in the Au-going direction is found to be comparable to that in Au+Au collisions when plotted as a function of the number of participating nucleons. In the Cu-going direction, J/ψ production shows a stronger suppression. This difference is comparable in magnitude and has the same sign as the difference expected from shadowing effects due to stronger low-x gluon suppression in the larger Au nucleus.
