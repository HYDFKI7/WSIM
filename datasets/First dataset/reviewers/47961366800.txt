The data sample, collected by the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb<sup>−1</sup>. Candidate events are selected by requiring two or more jets and a large imbalance in the transverse momentum. To enhance the analysis sensitivity, at least one of the jets is required to be identified as originating from a charm quark using an algorithm specifically designed for this analysis. The selected events are in good agreement with standard model predictions. In the case of large mass splitting between the scalar top quark and the neutralino we exclude a scalar top quark mass below 180 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> at 95% confidence level.

84929403808	Measurements of fiducial and differential cross sections for Higgs boson production in the diphoton decay channel at √s = 8 TeV with ATLAS	Measurements of fiducial and differential cross sections are presented for Higgs boson production in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √s = 8TeV. The analysis is performed in the H → γγ decay channel using 20.3 fb<sup>−1</sup> of data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The signal is extracted using a fit to the diphoton invariant mass spectrum assuming that the width of the resonance is much smaller than the experimental resolution. The signal yields are corrected for the effects of detector inefficiency and resolution. The pp → H → γγ fiducial cross section is measured to be 43.2 ±9.4 (stat.) <sup>+3.2</sup><inf>−2.9</inf> (syst.) ±1.2 (lumi) fb for a Higgs boson of mass 125.4 GeV decaying to two isolated photons that have transverse momentum greater than 35% and 25% of the diphoton invariant mass and each with absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.37. Four additional fiducial cross sections and two cross-section limits are presented in phase space regions that test the theoretical modelling of different Higgs boson production mechanisms, or are sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model. Differential cross sections are also presented, as a function of variables related to the diphoton kinematics and the jet activity produced in the Higgs boson events. The observed spectra are statistically limited but broadly in line with the theoretical expectations.

Data collected from pp collisions at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of √s = 7 TeV during 2011, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb<sup>-1</sup>, were used. A search was performed for top-quark pair-production events, with one top quark decaying through the t → Zq FCNC (q = u, c) channel, and the other through the Standard Model dominant mode t → Wb. Only the decays of the Z boson to charged leptons and leptonic W-boson decays were considered as signal. Consequently, the final-state topology is characterised by the presence of three isolated charged leptons, at least two jets and missing transverse momentum from the undetected neutrino. No evidence for an FCNC signal was found. An upper limit on the t → Zq branching ratio of BR(t → Zq) < 0.73% is set at the 95% confidence level. Copyright CERN.

These measurements are obtained using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.5 fb<sup>−1</sup>, recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2011. The data are corrected for detector effects so that cross-sections are presented at the particle level. Cross-sections are measured up to 5TeV dijet mass using jets reconstructed with the anti-k<inf>t</inf> algorithm for values of the jet radius parameter of 0.4 and 0.6. The cross-sections are compared with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations by NLOJet++ corrected to account for non-perturbative effects. Comparisons with POWHEG predictions, using a next-to-leading-order matrix element calculation interfaced to a partonshower Monte Carlo simulation, are also shown. Electroweak effects are accounted for in both cases. The quantitative comparison of data and theoretical predictions obtained using various parameterizations of the parton distribution functions is performed using a frequentist method. In general, good agreement with data is observed for the NLOJet++ theoretical predictions when using the CT10, NNPDF2.1 and MSTW 2008 PDF sets. Disagreement is observed when using the ABM11 and HERAPDF1.5 PDF sets for some ranges of dijet mass and half the rapidity separation. An example setting a lower limit on the compositeness scale for a model of contact interactions is presented, showing that the unfolded results can be used to constrain contributions to dijet production beyond that predicted by the Standard Model.

Cross sections are measured differentially in terms of Δη<sup>F</sup>, the larger of the pseudorapidity regions extending to the limits of the ATLAS sensitivity, at η = ±4.9, in which no final state particles are produced above a transverse momentum threshold p<sup>cut</sup><inf>T</inf>. The measurements span the region 0 < Δη<sup>F</sup> < 8 for 200 MeV < p<sup>cut</sup><inf>T</inf> < 800 MeV. At small Δη<sup>F</sup>, the data test the reliability of hadronisation models in describing rapidity and transverse momentum fluctuations in final state particle production. The measurements at larger gap sizes are dominated by contributions from the single diffractive dissociation process (pp →Xp), enhanced by double dissociation (pp → XY) where the invariant mass of the lighter of the two dissociation systems satisfies M<inf>Y</inf> < 7 GeV. The resulting cross section is dσ/dΔη<sup>F</sup> ≈1 mb for Δη<sup>F</sup> > 3. The large rapidity gap data are used to constrain the value of the Pomeron intercept appropriate to triple Regge models of soft diffraction. The cross section integrated over all gap sizes is compared with other LHC inelastic cross section measurements.

The tt events are selected in the dilepton decay channel with two identified b-jets from the top quark decays. Events are vetoed if they contain an additional jet with transverse momentum above a threshold in a central rapidity interval.

An alternate measurement is also performed, in which events are vetoed if the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional jets in each rapidity interval is above a threshold. In both measurements, the data are corrected for detector effects and compared to the theoretical models implemented in MC@NLO, POWHEG, ALPGEN and SHERPA. The experimental uncertainties are often smaller than the spread of theoretical predictions, allowing deviations between data and theory to be observed in some regions of phase space.

Assuming pair production, coupling to left-handed fermions, and a branching ratio of 100% for each final state, masses below 409 GeV, 375 GeV, and 398 GeV are excluded for e<sup>±</sup> e<sup>±</sup>, e<sup>±</sup> μ<sup>±</sup>, and μ<sup>±</sup> μ<sup>±</sup>, respectively.

84873453098	Search for resonances decaying into top-quark pairs using fully hadronic decays in pp collisions with ATLAS at √s=7 TeV	A search for resonances produced in 7 TeV proton-proton collisions and decaying into top-quark pairs is described. In this Letter events where the top-quark decay produces two massive jets with large transverse momenta recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider are considered. Two techniques that rely on jet substructure are used to separate top-quark jets from those arising from light quarks and gluons. In addition, each massive jet is required to have evidence of an associated bottom-quark decay. The data are consistent with the Standard Model, and limits can be set on the production cross section times branching fraction of a Z′ boson and a Kaluza-Klein gluon resonance. These limits exclude, at the 95% credibility level, Z′ bosons with masses 0.70-1.00 TeV as well as 1.28-1.32 TeV and Kaluza-Klein gluons with masses 0.70-1.62 TeV. © 2013 Cern for the benefit of the ATLAS collaboration.

84874452534	Search for pair-produced massive coloured scalars in four-jet final states with the ATLAS detector in proton–proton collisions at √s =7 TeV	A search for pair-produced massive coloured scalar particles decaying to a four-jet final state is performed by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in proton–proton collisions at √s = 7 TeV. The analysed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb<sup>−1</sup>. No deviation from the Standard Model is observed in the invariant mass spectrum of the two-jet pairs. A limit on the scalar gluon pair production cross section of 70 pb (10 pb) is obtained at the 95 % confidence level for a scalar gluon mass of 150 GeV (350 GeV). Interpreting these results as mass limits on scalar gluons, masses ranging from 150 GeV to 287 GeV are excluded at the 95 % confidence level.

84874477879	Measurements of top quark pair relative differential cross-sections with ATLAS in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV	Measurements are presented of differential crosss√ ections for top quark pair production in pp collisions at s = 7 TeV relative to the total inclusive top quark pair production cross-section. A data sample of 2.05 fb<sup>−1</sup> recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider is used. Relative differential cross-sections are derived as a function of the invariant mass, the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the top quark pair system. Events are selected in the lepton (electron or muon) + jets channel. The backgroundsubtracted differential distributions are corrected for detector effects, normalized to the total inclusive top quark pair production cross-section and compared to theoretical predictions. The measurement uncertainties range typically between 10 % and 20 % and are generally dominated by systematic effects. No significant deviations from the Standard Model expectations are observed.

84876303722	Measurement of the flavour composition of dijet events in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	This paper describes a measurement of the flavour composition of dijet events produced in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector. The measurement uses the full 2010 data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 39 pb<sup>−1</sup>. Six possible combinations of light, charm and bottom jets are identified in the dijet events, where the jet flavour is defined by the presence of bottom, charm or solely light flavour hadrons in the jet. Kinematic variables, based on the properties of displaced decay vertices and optimised for jet flavour identification, are used in a multidimensional template fit to measure the fractions of these dijet flavour states as functions of the leading jet transverse momentum in the range 40 GeV to 500 GeV and jet rapidity |y| < 2.1. The fit results agree with the predictions of leading- and next-to-leading-order calculations, with the exception of the dijet fraction composed of bottom and light flavour jets, which is underestimated by all models at large transverse jet momenta. The ability to identify jets containing two b-hadrons, originating from e.g. gluon splitting, is demonstrated. The difference between bottom jet production rates in leading and subleading jets is consistent with the next-to-leading-order predictions.

The sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35 pb<sup>−1</sup>. Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits measured by the calorimeters and calibrated using different jet calibration schemes. The jet energy resolution is measured with two different in situ methods which are found to be in agreement within uncertainties. The total uncertainties on these measurements range from 20 % to 10 % for jets within |y| < 2.8 and with transverse momenta increasing from 30 GeV to 500 GeV. Overall, the Monte Carlo simulation of the jet energy resolution agrees with the data within 10 %.

The search uses a set of variables carrying information on the event kinematics transverse and parallel to the beam line that are sensitive to several topologies expected in supersymmetry. Mutually exclusive final states are defined, allowing a combination of all channels to increase the search sensitivity. No deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed. Upper limits at 95 % confidence level on visible cross-sections for the production of new particles are extracted. Results are interpreted in the context of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension to the Standard Model and in supersymmetry-inspired models with diverse, high-multiplicity final states.

84876447844	Single hadron response measurement and calorimeter jet energy scale uncertainty with the ATLAS detector at the LHC	The uncertainty on the calorimeter energy response to jets of particles is derived for the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). First, the calorimeter response to single isolated charged hadrons is measured and compared to the Monte Carlo simulation using proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of √s = 900 GeV and 7 TeV collected during 2009 and 2010. Then, using the decay of K<inf>s</inf> and Λ particles, the calorimeter response to specific types of particles (positively and negatively charged pions, protons, and anti-protons) is measured and compared to the Monte Carlo predictions. Finally, the jet energy scale uncertainty is determined by propagating the response uncertainty for single charged and neutral particles to jets. The response uncertainty is 2–5 % for central isolated hadrons and 1–3 % for the final calorimeter jet energy scale.

The measurement is based on the full 2010 data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb<sup>−1</sup> which was collected using the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Cluster splitting scales are measured in events containing W bosons decaying to electrons or muons. The measurement comprises the four hardest splitting scales in a k<inf>T</inf> cluster sequence of the hadronic activity accompanying the W boson, and ratios of these splitting scales. Backgrounds such as multi-jet and top-quark-pair production are subtracted and the results are corrected for detector effects. Predictions from various Monte Carlo event generators at particle level are compared to the data. Overall, reasonable agreement is found with all generators, but larger deviations between the predictions and the data are evident in the soft regions of the splitting scales.

The measurements are performed in the region |η| < 4.8 for two event classes: those requiring the presence of particles with a low transverse momentum and those requiring particles with a significant transverse momentum. In the second dataset measurements are made in the region transverse to the hard scatter. The distributions are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators, which generally tend to underestimate the amount of transverse energy at high |η|. Copyright CERN.

Jets are identified using the anti-k<inf>t</inf> algorithm with two radius parameters of 0.4 and 0.6. The inclusive jet double-differential cross-section is presented as a function of the jet transverse momentum p<inf>T</inf> and jet rapidity y, covering a range of 20 ≤ p<inf>T</inf> < 430 GeV and |y| < 4.4. The ratio of the cross-section to the inclusive jet cross-section measurement at √s = 7 TeV, published by the ATLAS Collaboration, is calculated as a function of both transverse momentum and the dimensionless quantity x<inf>T</inf> = 2p<inf>T/</inf> √s, in bins of jet rapidity. The systematic uncertainties on the ratios are significantly reduced due to the cancellation of correlated uncertainties in the two measurements. Results are compared to the prediction from next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations corrected for non-perturbative effects, and next-to-leading order Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, the ATLAS jet cross-section measurements at √s = 2.76 TeV and √s = 7 TeV are analysed within a framework of next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations to determine parton distribution functions of the proton, taking into account the correlations between the measurements.

Properties of jets subjected to the mass-drop filtering, trimming, and pruning algorithms are found to have a reduced sensitivity to multiple proton-proton interactions, are more stable at high luminosity and improve the physics potential of searches for heavy boosted objects. Studies of the expected discrimination power of jet mass and jet substructure observables in searches for new physics are also presented. Event samples enriched in boosted W and Z bosons and top-quark pairs are used to study both the individual jet invariant mass scales and the efficacy of algorithms to tag boosted hadronic objects.

AALTONEN et al.	Drell-Yan lepton pairs are produced in the process pp̄→μ+μ- +X through an intermediate γ*/Zboson. The forward-backward asymmetry in the polar-angle distribution of the μ- as a function of the invariant mass of the μ+μ- pair is used to obtain the effective leptonic determination sin2θefflept of the electroweak-mixing parameter sin2θW, from which the value of sin2θW is derived assuming the standard model. The measurement sample, recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF), corresponds to 9.2fb-1 of integrated luminosity from pp̄ collisions at a center-of-momentum energy of 1.96 TeV, and is the full CDF Run II data set. The value of sin2θefflept is found to be 0.2315±0. 0010, where statistical and systematic uncertainties are combined in quadrature. When interpreted within the context of the standard model using the on-shell renormalization scheme, where sin2θW=1-MW2/MZ2, the measurement yields sin2θW=0.2233±0.0009, or equivalently a W-boson mass of 80.365±0.047GeV/c2.

The data set used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.7fb-1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The presence of additional HF (b or c) quarks in the tt̄ sample is inferred by looking for events with at least three b-tagged jets, where two are attributed to the b quarks from the tt̄ decays and the third to additional HF production. The dominant background to tt̄+HF in this sample is tt̄+jet events in which a light-flavor jet is misidentified as a heavy-flavor jet. To determine the heavy- and light-flavor content of the additional b-tagged jets, a fit to the vertex mass distribution of b-tagged jets in the sample is performed. The result of the fit shows that 79±14(stat)±22(syst) of the 105 selected extra b-tagged jets originate from HF quarks, 3 standard deviations away from the hypothesis of zero tt̄+HF production. The result for extra HF production is quoted as a ratio (RHF) of the cross section for tt̄+HF production to the cross section for tt̄ production with at least one additional jet. Both cross sections are measured in a fiducial kinematic region within the ATLAS acceptance. RHF is measured to be [6.2±1.1(stat)±1.8(syst)]% for jets with pT>25GeV and |η|<2.5, in agreement with the expectations from Monte Carlo generators. © 2014 CERN, for the ATLAS Collaboration.

For dilepton and four-lepton invariant mass regions m+->5GeV and 80<m4<100GeV, the measured cross sections are 76±18(stat) ±4(syst)±1.4(lumi)fb and 107±9(stat)±4(syst) ±3.0(lumi)fb at s=7 and 8 TeV, respectively. By subtracting the nonresonant 4 production contributions and normalizing with Z→μ+μ- events, the branching fraction for the Z boson decay to 4 is determined to be (3.20±0.25(stat)±0.13(syst))×10-6, consistent with the standard model prediction.

84901919886	Measurement of B (t →wb) /B (t →wq) in top-quark-pair decays using dilepton events and the full CDF run II data set	We present a measurement of the ratio of the top-quark branching fractions R=B(t→Wb)/B(t→Wq), where q represents any quark flavor, in events with two charged leptons, imbalance in total transverse energy, and at least two jets. The measurement uses proton-antiproton collision data at center-of-mass energy 1.96 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 8.7fb-1 collected with the Collider Detector at Fermilab during Run II of the Tevatron. We measure R to be 0.87±0.07, and extract the magnitude of the top-bottom quark coupling to be |Vtb|=0.93±0.04, assuming three generations of quarks. Under these assumptions, a lower limit of |Vtb|>0.85(0.87) at 95% (90%) credibility level is set. © 2014 American Physical Society.

Assuming the electroweak production of top quarks of mass 172.5GeV/c2 in the s channel, a cross section of 1.12-0.57+0.61 (stat+syst) pb with a significance of 1.9 standard deviations is measured. This measurement is combined with the result obtained from events with an imbalance in total transverse momentum, b-tagged jets, and exactly one identified lepton, yielding a cross section of 1.36-0.32+0.37 (stat+syst) pb, with a significance of 4.2 standard deviations. © 2014 American Physical Society.

The data are collected with the Collider Detector at Fermilab and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 9.1fb-1. We measure the leptonic forward-backward asymmetry, AFB, to be 0.072±0.060 and the leptonic pair forward-backward asymmetry, AFB, to be 0.076±0.082.

84905017780	Search for new physics in trilepton events and limits on the associated chargino-neutralino production at CDF	We perform a search for new physics using final states consisting of three leptons and a large imbalance in transverse momentum resulting from proton-antiproton collisions at 1.96 TeV center-of-mass energy. We use data corresponding to 5.8fb-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by the CDF II detector at the Tevatron collider. Our main objective is to investigate possible new low-momentum (down to 5GeV/c) multileptonic final states not investigated by LHC experiments. Relative to previous CDF analyses, we expand the geometric and kinematic coverage of electrons and muons and utilize tau leptons that decay hadronically. Inclusion of tau leptons is particularly important for supersymmetry (SUSY) searches. The results are consistent with standard-model predictions within 1.85σ. By optimizing our event selection to increase sensitivity to the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) SUSY model, we set limits on the associated production of chargino and next-to-lightest neutralino, the SUSY partners of the electroweak gauge bosons. We exclude cross sections up to 0.1 pb and chargino masses up to 168GeV/c2 at 95% C.L., for a suitable set of mSUGRA parameters. We also exclude a region of the two-dimensional space of the masses of the neutralino and the supersymmetric partner of the tau lepton, not previously excluded at the Tevatron. © 2014 American Physical Society.

The primary purpose of this calorimeter is the measurement of electron and photon kinematic properties. It also provides a crucial input for measuring jets and missing transverse momentum. An advanced data monitoring procedure was designed to quickly identify issues that would affect detector performance and ensure that only the best quality data are used for physics analysis. This article presents the validation procedure developed during the 2011 and 2012 LHC data-taking periods, in which more than 98% of the proton-proton luminosity recorded by ATLAS at a centre-of-mass energy of 7-8 TeV had calorimeter data quality suitable for physics analysis. © CERN 2014 for the benefit of the ATLAS collaboration.

We further report the first study of resonances consistent with orbitally excited B+ mesons and an updated measurement of the properties of orbitally excited B0 and Bs0 mesons.

Furthermore, we measure the production rates of the orbitally excited B0,+ states relative to the B0,+ ground state. The masses of the new B(5970) resonances are 5978±5(stat)±12(syst)MeV/c2 for the neutral state and 5961±5(stat)±12(syst)MeV/c2 for the charged state, assuming that the resonance decays into Bπ final states.

84907497537	Measurement of event-plane correlations in s NN =2.76 TeV lead-lead collisions with the ATLAS detector	A measurement of event-plane correlations involving two or three event planes of different order is presented as a function of centrality for 7 μb-1 Pb+Pb collision data at sNN=2.76 TeV, recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Fourteen correlators are measured using a standard event-plane method and a scalar-product method, and the latter method is found to give a systematically larger correlation signal. Several different trends in the centrality dependence of these correlators are observed. These trends are not reproduced by predictions based on the Glauber model, which includes only the correlations from the collision geometry in the initial state. Calculations that include the final-state collective dynamics are able to describe qualitatively, and in some cases also quantitatively, the centrality dependence of the measured correlators. These observations suggest that both the fluctuations in the initial geometry and the nonlinear mixing between different harmonics in the final state are important for creating these correlations in momentum space. © 2014 CERN, for the ATLAS Collaboration.

84907502729	Search for pair-produced third-generation squarks decaying via charm quarks or in compressed supersymmetric scenarios in pp collisions at √s =8TeV with the ATLAS detector	Results of a search for supersymmetry via direct production of third-generation squarks are reported, using 20.3fb-1 of proton-proton collision data at s=8TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2012. Two different analysis strategies based on monojetlike and c-tagged event selections are carried out to optimize the sensitivity for direct top squark-pair production in the decay channel to a charm quark and the lightest neutralino (t∼1→c+χ∼10) across the top squark-neutralino mass parameter space. No excess above the Standard Model background expectation is observed. The results are interpreted in the context of direct pair production of top squarks and presented in terms of exclusion limits in the (mt∼1, mχ∼10) parameter space. A top squark of mass up to about 240 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level for arbitrary neutralino masses, within the kinematic boundaries. Top squark masses up to 270 GeV are excluded for a neutralino mass of 200 GeV. In a scenario where the top squark and the lightest neutralino are nearly degenerate in mass, top squark masses up to 260 GeV are excluded. The results from the monojetlike analysis are also interpreted in terms of compressed scenarios for top squark-pair production in the decay channel t∼1→b+ff′+χ∼10 and sbottom pair production with b∼1→b+χ∼10, leading to a similar exclusion for nearly mass-degenerate third-generation squarks and the lightest neutralino. The results in this paper significantly extend previous results at colliders.

84907630903	Light-quark and gluon jet discrimination in pp collisions at (Formula presented.) with the ATLAS detector	A likelihood-based discriminant for the identification of quark- and gluon-initiated jets is built and validated using 4.7 fb(Formula presented.) of proton–proton collision data at (Formula presented.) collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Data samples with enriched quark or gluon content are used in the construction and validation of templates of jet properties that are the input to the likelihood-based discriminant. The discriminating power of the jet tagger is established in both data and Monte Carlo samples within a systematic uncertainty of (Formula presented.) 10–20 %. In data, light-quark jets can be tagged with an efficiency of (Formula presented.) while achieving a gluon-jet mis-tag rate of (Formula presented.) in a (Formula presented.) range between (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) for jets in the acceptance of the tracker. The rejection of gluon-jets found in the data is significantly below what is attainable using a Pythia 6 Monte Carlo simulation, where gluon-jet mis-tag rates of 10 % can be reached for a 50 % selection efficiency of light-quark jets using the same jet properties.

84907683450	A neural network clustering algorithm for the ATLAS silicon pixel detector	A novel technique to identify and split clusters created by multiple charged particles in the ATLAS pixel detector using a set of artificial neural networks is presented. Such merged clusters are a common feature of tracks originating from highly energetic objects, such as jets. Neural networks are trained using Monte Carlo samples produced with a detailed detector simulation. This technique replaces the former clustering approach based on a connected component analysis and charge interpolation. The performance of the neural network splitting technique is quantified using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC collected by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and from Monte Carlo simulations. This technique reduces the number of clusters shared between tracks in highly energetic jets by up to a factor of three. It also provides more precise position and error estimates of the clusters in both the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter resolution.

In framework of minimal gauge-mediated SUSY breaking models, values of SUSY breaking scale Λ below 63 TeV are excluded, independently of tan β. Exclusion limits are also derived for an mSUGRA/CMSSM model, in both R-parity-conserving and R-parity-violating case. A further interpretation is presented in a framework of natural gauge mediation, in which gluino is assumed to be only light coloured sparticle and gluino masses below 1090 GeV are excluded.

Charged-particle mean (Formula presented.) and densities of all-particle (Formula presented.) and charged-particle multiplicity and (Formula presented.) have been measured in regions azimuthally transverse to the hardest jet in each event. These are presented both as one-dimensional distributions and with their mean values as functions of the leading-jet transverse momentum from 20 to 800 (Formula presented.). The correlation of charged-particle mean (Formula presented.) with charged-particle multiplicity is also studied, and the (Formula presented.) densities include the forward rapidity region; these features provide extra data constraints for Monte Carlo modelling of colour reconnection and beam-remnant effects respectively. For the first time, underlying event observables have been computed separately for inclusive jet and exclusive dijet event selections, allowing more detailed study of the interplay of multiple partonic scattering and QCD radiation contributions to the underlying event. Comparisons to the predictions of different Monte Carlo models show a need for further model tuning, but the standard approach is found to generally reproduce the features of the underlying event in both types of event selection.

Significant long-range "ridgelike" correlations are observed for pairs with small (|Δϕ|<π/3) and back-to-back pairs (|Δφ|>2π/3) over the transverse momentum range 0.4<p<inf>T</inf><12 GeV and in different intervals of event activity. The event activity is defined by either the number of reconstructed tracks or the total transverse energy on the Pb-fragmentation side. The azimuthal structure of such long-range correlations is Fourier decomposed to obtain the harmonics ν<inf>n</inf> as a function of pT and event activity. The extracted ν<inf>n</inf> values for n=2 to 5 decrease with n. The ν<inf>2</inf> and ν<inf>3</inf> values are found to be positive in the measured pT range. The ν<inf>1</inf> is also measured as a function of pT and is observed to change sign around pT≈1.5-2.0 GeV and then increase to about 0.1 for pT>4 GeV. The ν<inf>2</inf> (pT), ν<inf>3</inf> (pT), and ν<inf>4</inf> (pT) are compared to the ν<inf>n</inf> coefficients in Pb+Pb collisions at √sNN=2.76 TeV with similar event multiplicities. Reasonable agreement is observed after accounting for the difference in the average pT of particles produced in the two collision systems.

84914140238	Search for long-lived neutral particles decaying into lepton jets in proton-proton collisions at √s= 8TeV with the ATLAS detector	Abstract: Several models of physics beyond the Standard Model predict neutral particles that decay into final states consisting of collimated jets of light leptons and hadrons (so-called “lepton jets”). These particles can also be long-lived with decay length comparable to, or even larger than, the LHC detectors’ linear dimensions. This paper presents the results of a search for lepton jets in proton-proton collisions at the centre-of-mass energy of √s= 8TeV in a sample of 20.3 fb<sup>−1</sup> collected during 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Limits on models predicting Higgs boson decays to neutral long-lived lepton jets are derived as a function of the particle’s proper decay length.

84914179451	Search for top squark pair production in final states with one isolated lepton, jets, and missing transverse momentum in (Formula presented.)= 8 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector	The results of a search for top squark (stop) pair production in final states with one isolated lepton, jets, and missing transverse momentum are reported. The analysis is performed with proton-proton collision data at (Formula presented.) = 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20 fb<sup>−1</sup>. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is taken to be the lightest neutralino which only interacts weakly and is assumed to be stable. The stop decay modes considered are those to a top quark and the LSP as well as to a bottom quark and the lightest chargino, where the chargino decays to the LSP by emitting a W boson. A wide range of scenarios with different mass splittings between the stop, the lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino are considered, including cases where the W bosons or the top quarks are off-shell. Decay modes involving the heavier charginos and neutralinos are addressed using a set of phenomenological models of supersymmetry. No significant excess over the Standard Model prediction is observed. A stop with a mass between 210 and 640 GeV decaying directly to a top quark and a massless LSP is excluded at 95% confidence level, and in models where the mass of the lightest chargino is twice that of the LSP, stops are excluded at 95% confidence level up to a mass of 500 GeV for an LSP mass in the range of 100 to 150 GeV. Stringent exclusion limits are also derived for all other stop decay modes considered, and model-independent upper limits are set on the visible cross-section for processes beyond the Standard Model.

84919372915	Comprehensive measurements of t -channel single top-quark production cross sections at s =7TeV with the ATLAS detector	This article presents measurements of the t-channel single top-quark (t) and top-antiquark (t¯) total production cross sections σ(tq) and σ(t¯q), their ratio Rt=σ(tq)/σ(t¯q), and a measurement of the inclusive production cross section σ(tq+t¯q) in proton-proton collisions at s=7TeV at the LHC. Differential cross sections for the tq and t¯q processes are measured as a function of the transverse momentum and the absolute value of the rapidity of t and t¯, respectively. The analyzed data set was recorded with the ATLAS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.59fb-1. Selected events contain one charged lepton, large missing transverse momentum, and two or three jets. The cross sections are measured by performing a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the output distributions of neural networks. The resulting measurements are σ(tq)=46±1(stat)±6(syst)pb, σ(t¯q)=23±1(stat)±3(syst)pb, Rt=2.04±0.13(stat)±0.12(syst), and σ(tq+t¯q)=68±2(stat)±8(syst)pb, consistent with the Standard Model expectation. The uncertainty on the measured cross sections is dominated by systematic uncertainties, while the uncertainty on Rt is mainly statistical. Using the ratio of σ(tq+t¯q) to its theoretical prediction, and assuming that the top-quark-related CKM matrix elements obey the relation |Vtb|蠑|Vts|,|Vtd|, we determine |Vtb|=1.02±0.07.

84919401685	Search for nonpointing and delayed photons in the diphoton and missing transverse momentum final state in 8 TeV pp collisions at the LHC using the ATLAS detector search for nonpointing and delayed photons in ... G. Aad et al.	A search has been performed, using the full 20.3fb-1 data sample of 8 TeV proton-proton collisions collected in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, for photons originating from a displaced vertex due to the decay of a neutral long-lived particle into a photon and an invisible particle. The analysis investigates the diphoton plus missing transverse momentum final state, and is therefore most sensitive to pair production of long-lived particles. The analysis technique exploits the capabilities of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter to make precise measurements of the flight direction, as well as the time of flight, of photons. No excess is observed over the Standard Model predictions for background. Exclusion limits are set within the context of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models, with the lightest neutralino being the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle and decaying into a photon and gravitino with a lifetime in the range from 250 ps to about 100 ns.

84919947960	Measurements of spin correlation in top-antitop quark events from proton-proton collisions at s =7TeV using the ATLAS detector	Measurements of spin correlation in top quark pair production are presented using data collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC with proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6fb-1. Events are selected in final states with two charged leptons and at least two jets and in final states with one charged lepton and at least four jets. Four different observables sensitive to different properties of the top quark pair production mechanism are used to extract the correlation between the top and antitop quark spins. Some of these observables are measured for the first time. The measurements are in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction at next-to-leading-order accuracy.

84920080864	Search for contact interactions and large extra dimensions in the dilepton channel using proton–proton collisions at √s=8 TeV with the ATLAS detector	A search is conducted for non-resonant new phenomena in dielectron and dimuon final states, originating from either contact interactions or large extra spatial dimensions. The LHC 2012 proton–proton collision dataset recorded by the ATLAS detector is used, corresponding to 20 fb(Formula presented.) (Formula presented.) at (Formula presented.)

84920099129	A measurement of the ratio of the production cross sections for W and Z bosons in association with jets with the ATLAS detector	The ratio of the production cross sections for W and Z bosons in association with jets has been measured in proton–proton collisions at√s = TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The measurement is based on the entire 2011 dataset, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of4.6fb-1. Inclusive and differential cross-section ratios for massive vector bosons decaying to electrons and muons are measured in association with jets with transverse momentum pT > 30GeV and jet rapidity |y|<4.4. The measurements are compared to next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations and to predictions from different Monte Carlo generators implementing leading-order matrix elements supplemented by parton showers.

84920136557	Measurement of the muon reconstruction performance of the ATLAS detector using 2011 and 2012 LHC proton–proton collision data	This paper presents the performance of the ATLAS muon reconstruction during the LHC run with pp collisions at √s=7–8 TeV in 2011–2012, focusing mainly on data collected in 2012. Measurements of the reconstruction efficiency and of the momentum scale and resolution, based on large reference samples of (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) decays, are presented and compared to Monte Carlo simulations. Corrections to the simulation, to be used in physics analysis, are provided. Over most of the covered phase space (muon (Formula presented.)

GeV, to (Formula presented.) at large rapidity and (Formula presented.) GeV. The momentum scale is known with an uncertainty of 0.05% to 0.2% depending on rapidity. A method for the recovery of final state radiation from the muons is also presented.

84920268886	Measurement of distributions sensitive to the underlying event in inclusive Z-boson production in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	A measurement of charged-particle distributions sensitive to the properties of the underlying event is presented for an inclusive sample of events containing a Z-boson, decaying to an electron or muon pair. The measurement is based on data collected using the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb-1. Distributions of the charged particle multiplicity and of the charged particle transverse momentum are measured in regions of azimuthal angle defined with respect to the Z-boson direction. The measured distributions are compared to similar distributions measured in jet events, and to the predictions of various Monte Carlo generators implementing different underlying event models.

84919880597	Measurement of the (Math presented.) and 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector	The inclusive top quark pair (Formula presented.) pair in the final state. The measurement was performed with the 2011 7 TeV dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 (Formula presented.)-tag a jet from a top quark decay, thereby minimising the associated systematic uncertainties. The cross-section was measured to be: (Formula presented.)where the four uncertainties arise from data statistics, experimental and theoretical systematic effects, knowledge of the integrated luminosity and of the LHC beam energy. The results are consistent with recent theoretical QCD calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order. Fiducial measurements corresponding to the experimental acceptance of the leptons are also reported, together with the ratio of cross-sections measured at the two centre-of-mass energies. The inclusive cross-section results were used to determine the top quark pole mass via the dependence of the theoretically predicted cross-section on (Formula presented.) GeV. By looking for an excess of (Formula presented.) production with respect to the QCD prediction, the results were also used to place limits on the pair-production of supersymmetric top squarks (Formula presented.) with masses close to the top quark mass, decaying via (Formula presented.) to predominantly right-handed top quarks and a light neutralino (Formula presented.), the lightest supersymmetric particle. Top squarks with masses between the top quark mass and 177 GeV are excluded at the 95 % confidence level.

84919918864	Electron and photon energy calibration with the ATLAS detector using LHC Run 1 data	This paper presents the electron and photon energy calibration achieved with the ATLAS detector using about 25 fb-1 of LHC proton–proton collision data taken at centre-of-mass energies of (Equation Present) and 8 TeV. The reconstruction of electron and photon energies is optimised using multivariate algorithms. The response of the calorimeter layers is equalised in data and simulation, and the longitudinal profile of the electromagnetic showers is exploited to estimate the passive material in front of the calorimeter and reoptimise the detector simulation. After all corrections, the Z resonance is used to set the absolute energy scale. For electrons from Z decays, the achieved calibration is typically accurate to 0.05 % in most of the detector acceptance, rising to 0.2 % in regions with large amounts of passive material. The remaining inaccuracy is less than 0.2–1 % for electrons with a transverse energy of 10 GeV, and is on average 0.3 % for photons. The detector resolution is determined with a relative inaccuracy of less than 10 % for electrons and photons up to 60 GeV transverse energy, rising to 40 % for transverse energies above 500 GeV.

84924034909	Measurement of indirect CP -violating asymmetries in D0 →k+K- and D0 →π+π- decays at CDF	We report a measurement of the indirect CP-violating asymmetries (AΓ) between effective lifetimes of anticharm and charm mesons reconstructed in D0→K+K- and D0→π+π- decays. We use the full data set of proton-antiproton collisions collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab experiment and corresponding to 9.7fb-1 of integrated luminosity. The strong-interaction decay D∗+→D0π+ is used to identify the meson at production as D0 or D¯0. We statistically subtract D0 and D¯0 mesons originating from b-hadron decays and measure the yield asymmetry between anticharm and charm decays as a function of decay time. We measure AΓ(K+K-)=(-0.19±0.15(stat)±0.04(syst))% and AΓ(π+π-)=(-0.01±0.18(stat)±0.03(syst))%. The results are consistent with the hypothesis of CP symmetry and their combination yields AΓ=(-0.12±0.12)%.

84924040652	Search for supersymmetry in events with four or more leptons in s =8TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector	Results from a search for supersymmetry in events with four or more leptons including electrons, muons and taus are presented. The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to 20.3fb-1 of proton-proton collisions delivered by the Large Hadron Collider at s=8TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector. Signal regions are designed to target supersymmetric scenarios that can be either enriched in or depleted of events involving the production of a Z boson. No significant deviations are observed in data from standard model predictions and results are used to set upper limits on the event yields from processes beyond the standard model. Exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level on the masses of relevant supersymmetric particles are obtained. In R-parity-violating simplified models with decays of the lightest supersymmetric particle to electrons and muons, limits of 1350 and 750 GeV are placed on gluino and chargino masses, respectively. In R-parity-conserving simplified models with heavy neutralinos decaying to a massless lightest supersymmetric particle, heavy neutralino masses up to 620 GeV are excluded. Limits are also placed on other supersymmetric scenarios.

84924420466	Measurement of differential production cross-sections for a Z boson in association with b-jets in 7 TeV proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector	Abstract: Measurements of differential production cross-sections of a Z boson in association with b-jets in pp collisions at √ = 7 TeV are reported. The data analysed correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb<sup>−1</sup> recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Particle-level cross-sections are determined for events with a Z boson decaying into an electron or muon pair, and containing b-jets. For events with at least one b-jet, the cross-section is presented as a function of the Z boson transverse momentum and rapidity, together with the inclusive b-jet cross-section as a function of b-jet transverse momentum, rapidity and angular separations between the b-jet and the Z boson. For events with at least two b-jets, the cross-section is determined as a function of the invariant mass and angular separation of the two highest transverse momentum b-jets, and as a function of the Z boson transverse momentum and rapidity. Results are compared to leading-order and next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations.

84925620206	Search for pair and single production of new heavy quarks that decay to a Z boson and a third-generation quark in pp collisions at (Formula presented.) TeV with the ATLAS detector	Abstract: A search is presented for the production of new heavy quarks that decay to a Z boson and a third-generation Standard Model quark. In the case of a new charge +2/3 quark (T ), the decay targeted is T → Zt, while the decay targeted for a new charge −1/3 quark (B) is B → Zb. The search is performed with a dataset corresponding to 20.3 fb<sup>−1</sup> of pp collisions at (Formula presented.) TeV recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Selected events contain a high transverse momentum Z boson candidate reconstructed from a pair of oppositely charged same-flavor leptons (electrons or muons), and are analyzed in two channels defined by the absence or presence of a third lepton. Hadronic jets, in particular those with properties consistent with the decay of a b-hadron, are also required to be present in selected events. Different requirements are made on the jet activity in the event in order to enhance the sensitivity to either heavy quark pair production mediated by the strong interaction, or single production mediated by the electroweak interaction. No significant excess of events above the Standard Model expectation is observed, and lower limits are derived on the mass of vector-like T and B quarks under various branching ratio hypotheses, as well as upper limits on the magnitude of electroweak coupling parameters.
