24144444042	An anti-control scheme for spiral under Lorenz chaotic signals	The Fitzhugh-Nagumo (FHN) equation is used to generate spiral and spatiotemporal chaos. The weak Lorenz chaotic signal is imposed on the system locally and globally. It is found that for the right chaotic driving signal, spiral and spatiotemporal chaos can be suppressed. The simulation results also show that this anti-control scheme is effective so that the system emerges into the stable states quickly after a short duration of chaotic driving (about 50 time units) and the continuous driving keeps the system in a homogeneous state. © 2005 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

29244434835	Synchronization and parameter identification of Rossler hyperchaotic system	Two methods were given to identify the unknown parameters of the 4-dimension Rossler hyperchaotic system. For the first scheme, it led the system to reach arbitrary desired stable point by using negative feedback control, and the equation for unknown parameters was found by solving the equation of the stable point. Another method was given to find the unknown parameters by selecting right initial value and constructing observer based on the stability theory. The controllers are found to be powerful. Based on the theory of linear error, the eigenvalues of the Jacobin matrix were got. Complete synchronization and phase synchronization were realized by setting the eigenvalues of the Jacobin matrix as right value (corresponding to negative and zero, respectively). Zero eigenvalues of the Jacobin matrix corresponding to phase was investigated in detail. The most interesting point is that all the controllers are got analytically. The numerical simulation results are consistent with the theory analysis.

32344448784	Suppression of a spiral wave using linear feedback	A class of excitable media described by the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equation is investigated. Based on the stable and self-adaptive theory, the error between the system's grid variables and the standard sampling of the periodical signal or constant signal was feed back into the system both globally and locally. When the controller was then shut off, automatically, the whole system became homogeneous. Additionally, the scheme was tested under noisy conditions. The numerical simulation's results demonstrate its effectiveness. The system reached a homogeneous state and a spiral wave was converted into a target wave, resulting in a wonderful pattern emerging using a different controller. The scheme proved robust in resisting the effects of noise.

84861654726	Spiral wave death, breakup induced by ion channel poisoning on regular Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal networks	The electric activities of neurons are often affected by ion channel poisoning, in particularly, interrupting normal transduction of signals within the brain. This may be due to changes in conductance and the number of active channels. Tetraethylammonium, for example, is known to cause ion channel poisoning of potassium channels, while tetrodotoxin has similar detrimental effects on sodium channels. The occurrence of spiral waves in neuronal systems was observed frequently in the past, and it was argued that these waves of excitation may play an important role by the propagation of electric signals across the quiescent regions of the brain. In this work, the parameters xk and xNa determine the ratio, with regards to the total number of ion channels, of active potassium and sodium channels, respectively, and they are taken to be representative also for the degree of channel poisoning. In the numerical studies, a well developed stable rotating spiral wave is used as the initial state to be controlled by the ion channel poisoning. We show that, under noise-free conditions, spiral waves are terminated whenever xk and xNa are set lower than a given threshold. However, breakup of spiral wave occurs if the intensity of the channel noise increases. In order to quantify these observations, we use a simple but robust synchronization measure, which captures succinctly the transition from spiral waves to homogeneous neuronal activity and/or broken turbulent state. The critical thresholds can be inferred from the abrupt changes occurring in the corresponding dependencies of synchronization versus the xk and xNa ratios. Furthermore, the sampled membrane potentials of a single neuron are recorded to detect the periodical spiral wave in a feasible way and the results could be dependent of the position of node (or site) to be monitored. Notably, small synchronization factors can be tightly associated to states where the formation of spiral waves is robust to channel poisoning and weak channel noise. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The influence of ion channel block in poisoned excitable membrane patches of a certain size is measured, by varying channel noise and channel densities resulting from the change in conductance. For example, tetraethylammonium is known to cause a block (poisoning) of potassium channels, while tetrodotoxin blocks sodium channels.

84897090198	Effect of an autapse on the firing pattern transition in a bursting neuron	On the basis of the Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neuron model, the dynamics of electrical activity and the transition of firing patterns induced by three types of autapses have been investigated in detail. The dynamic effect of an autapse is detected by imposing a feedback term with a specific time-delay and autaptic intensity. We found that the delayed autaptic feedback connection switches the electrical activities of the HR neuron among quiescent, periodic and chaotic firing patterns. In the case of an electrical autapse, the transition from a periodic to a chaotic state occurs depending on the specific autaptic intensity and the time-delay. The excitatory chemical autapse plays a positive role in generating and enhancing the chaotic state. A time delay could decrease and suppress the chaotic state in the case of inhibitory chemical self-connections with a proper autaptic intensity. The bifurcation diagram vs. time-delay and autaptic intensity has been extensively studied, and the time series of membrane potentials and the distribution of information entropy have also been calculated to confirm the bifurcation analysis. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

44849116368	Control of spiral wave and turbulence in the time-varied reaction-diffusion system	MaWe investigated the external electric field-induced transition of the spiral wave and turbulence in a class of time-varied reaction-diffusion systems. In our numerical simulation, a modified Fitzhugh-Nagumo model, which was used to describe the excitable and/or oscillatory media under appropriate parameters, was investigated. The effect induced by the random and/or other uncertain factors (for example, external and interior noise, gas pressure, temperature gradient and deformation of media etc.) was considered. The amplitude of the fluctuations of parameters was selected at appropriate values so that stable rotating spiral wave, meandering spiral wave and turbulence could be observed respectively. The external electric field was introduced into the media after a transient period allowing for parameter fluctuations. It was found that only the breakup of spiral wave was observed and the whole media could not reach homogeneous state when weak electric field and parameter fluctuation were used. It was confirmed that the breakup of spiral wave happens and then the whole media becomes stably homogeneous when appropriately strong intensity of external electric field is applied to the whole media together with the action of parameter fluctuation. The snapshots of the activator are used to investigate the transition of the patterns in the presence of external electric field and under parameter fluctuation, and relevant theoretical discussion is given in the present paper.

56349118495	Control chaos in Hindmarsh - Rose neuron by using intermittent feedback with one variable	The mechanism of the famous phase compression is discussed, and it is used to control the chaos in the Hindmarsh-Rose (H-R) model. It is numerically confirmed that the phase compression scheme can be understood as one kind of intermittent feedback scheme, which requires appropriate thresholds and feedback coefficient, and the intermittent feedback can be realized with the Heaviside function. In the case of control chaos, the output variable (usually the voltage or the membrane potential of the neuron) is sampled and compared with the external standard signal of the electric electrode. The error between the sampled variable and the external standard signal of the electrode is input into the system only when the sampled variable surpasses the selected thresholds. The numerical simulation results confirm that the chaotic H-R system can be controlled to reach arbitrary n-periodical (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,...) orbit or stable state even when just one variable is feed backed into the system intermittently.

In the case of the uniform distribution of fluctuations in two parameters, spiral wave cannot be observed for fluctuations beyond a certain range.

Too weak or too strong noise may act against the formation of spiral waves. At a certain noise level, spiral wave is maintained in a medium, in which spiral wave cannot be observed in the absence of the noise. It is difficult to make a stable spiral wave into unstable state by Gaussian coloured noise, unless the noise level is very high.

It is found that the spiral wave can be induced and developed in the coupled HR neurons in two-dimensional space, with appropriate initial values and a parameter region given. However, the spiral wave could encounter instability when the intensity of the external current reaches a threshold value of 1.945. The transition of spiral wave is found to be affected by coupling intensity D and bifurcation parameter r. The spiral wave becomes sparse as the coupling intensity increases, while the spiral wave is eliminated and the whole neuronal system becomes homogeneous as the bifurcation parameter increases to a certain threshold value. Then the coupling action of the four sub-adjacent neurons, which is described by coupling coefficient D′, is also considered, and it is found that the spiral wave begins to breakup due to the introduced coupling action from the sub-adjacent neurons (or sites) and together with the coupling action of the nearest-neighbour neurons, which is described by the coupling intensity D. © 2009 Chin.

The appearance and formation of spiral wave in the cardiac tissue is linked to monomorphic ventricular tachycardia that can denervate into polymorphic tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. The neuronal system often consists of a large number of neurons with complex connections. In this paper, we theoretically study the transition from spiral wave to spiral turbulence and homogeneous state (death of spiral wave) in two-dimensional array of the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron with completely nearest-neighbor connections. In our numerical studies, a stable rotating spiral wave is developed and selected as the initial state, then the bifurcation parameters are changed to different values to observe the transition from spiral wave to homogeneous state, breakup of spiral wave and weak change of spiral wave, respectively. A statistical factor of synchronization is defined with the mean field theory to analyze the transition from spiral wave to other spatial states, and the snapshots of the membrane potentials of all neurons and time series of mean membrane potentials of all neurons are also plotted to discuss the change of spiral wave. It is found that the sharp changing points in the curve for factor of synchronization vs. bifurcation parameter indicate sudden transition from spiral wave to other states.

Two controllable gain coefficients are introduced into the Lyapunov function, which is necessary to get the form of parameter observers and controllers for parameter estimation and synchronization, to adjust the transient period for complete synchronization and parameter identification. It is found that the identified results for the minimal parameter (three orders of magnitude less than the maximal parameter) oscillate with time (the estimated results for this parameter is not exact) while the four remaining parameters are estimated very well when one controller and five parameter observers are used to work on the driven system (response system). To the best of our knowledge, it could result from the great difference of five target parameters (values). As a result, this problem could be solved when two controllers and five parameter observers are used to change the driven system and all the unknown parameters are identified with high precision. Furthermore, longer transient period for parameter estimation and complete synchronization is required when too strong gain coefficients are used, whils parameters can not be estimated exactly if too weak gain coefficients are used. Therefore, appropriate gain coefficients are critical to achieve the shortest transient period for parameter identification and complete synchronization of chaotic systems, and the optimization of gain coefficients depends on the model being studied. Furthermore, it is confirmed by our numerical results that this scheme is effective and reliable to estimate the parameters even if some parameters jump suddenly. © 2010 Chin. Phys. Soc.

77951673768	Collective behaviors of spiral waves in the networks of hodgkin-huxley neurons in presence of channel noise	Collective behaviors of spiral waves in the networks of Hodgkin-Huxley neuron are investigated. A stable rotating spiral wave can be developed to occupy the quiescent areas in networks of neurons by selecting appropriate initial values for the variables in the networks of neurons. In our numerical studies, most neurons are quiescent and finite (few) numbers of neurons are selected with different values to form a spiral seed. In this way, neurons communicating are carried by propagating spiral wave to break through the quiescent domains (areas) in networks of neurons. The effect of membrane temperature on the formation of spiral wave is investigated by selecting different fixed membrane temperatures in the networks, and it is found that a spiral wave cannot be developed if the membrane temperature is close to a certain threshold. A quantitative factor of synchronization is defined to measure the statistical properties and collective behaviors of the spiral wave. And a distinct phase transition, which indicates the critical condition for spiral survival, is observed in the sudden changing point of the factors of synchronization curve vs. certain bifurcation parameter. Internal noise is introduced into ion channels (channel noise) with the Langevin method. It is found that a stable rotating spiral wave is developed and the spiral wave is robust to weak channel noise (the membrane patch is not small). The spiral wave can not grow up and the stable rotating spiral wave encounters instability in presence of strong channel noise. Coherence resonance-like behavior is observed in calculating the factors of synchronization in presence of channel noise. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

77953126849	Robustness and breakup of the spiral wave in a two-dimensional lattice network of neurons	The robustness and breakup of spiral wave in a two-dimensional lattice networks of neurons are investigated. The effect of smallworld type connection is often simplified with local regular connection and the long-range connection with certain probability. The network effect on the development of spiral wave can be better described by local regular connection and changeable long-range connection probability than fixed long-range connection probability because the long-range probability could be changeable in realistic biological system. The effect from the changeable probability for long-range connection is simplified by multiplicative noise. At first, a stable rotating spiral wave is developed by using appropriate initial values, parameters and no-flux boundary conditions, and then the effect of networks is investigated. Extensive numerical studies show that spiral wave keeps its alive and robust when the intensity of multiplicative noise is below a certain threshold, otherwise, the breakup of spiral wave occurs. A statistical factor of synchronization in two-dimensional array is defined to study the phase transition of spiral wave by checking the membrane potentials of all neurons corresponding to the critical parameters(the intensity of noise or forcing current) in the curve for factor of synchronization. The Hindmarsh-Rose model is investigated, the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model in the presence of the channel noise is also studied to check the model independence of our conclusions. And it is found that breakup of spiral wave is easier to be induced by the multiplicative noise in presence of channel noise. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

By introducing the conception of phase for a chaotic motion, it has been demonstrated that the mean frequency of chaotic attractor and the frequency of the parametric excitation may be locked in different ratios for certain parameter conditions, implying phase synchronization can be observed. The evolution from nonsynchronized state to phase synchronization has been discussed in detail, which reveals different phase dynamics may exist during the process. With the variation of parameters, the imaging point on the Poincaré plane may finally settle down onto the attractor, which yields phase synchronization. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

78049486899	A time-varying hyperchaotic system and its realization in circuit	A hyperchaotic system is often used to generate secure keys or carrier wave for secure communication and the realistic hyperchaotic circuit often is made of capacitor, nonlinear resistor unit and induction coil. Parameters are often fixed in these hyperchaotic circuits and the hyperchaotic property of the system can be estimated by using a scheme of synchronization and time series analysis. In this paper, a time-varying hyperchaotic system is proposed by introducing changeable electric power source into the circuit; the changeable electric power source is combined with induction coil or capacitor in series to generate changeable output signals to excite the system. The diagrams of improved circuit are illustrated and critical parameters in experimental circuits are presented; the Lyapunov exponent spectrum vs. external applied electric power source is calculated. It is confirmed that the improved circuit always holds two positive Lyapunov exponents when the external electric power source works, and the chaotic attractors are much too different from the original one; thus, a more changeable hyperchaotic system is constructed in experiment. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

78649361304	Spiral wave in small-world networks of hodgkin-huxley neurons	The effect of small-world connection and noise on the formation and transition of spiral wave in the networks of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons are investigated in detail. Some interesting results are found in our numerical studies. i) The quiescent neurons are activated to propagate electric signal to others by generating and developing spiral wave from spiral seed in small area. ii) A statistical factor is defined to describe the collective properties and phase transition induced by the topology of networks and noise. iii) Stable rotating spiral wave can be generated and keeps robust when the rewiring probability is below certain threshold, otherwise, spiral wave can not be developed from the spiral seed and spiral wave breakup occurs for a stable rotating spiral wave. iv) Gaussian white noise is introduced on the membrane of neurons to study the noise-induced phase transition on spiral wave in small-world networks of neurons. It is confirmed that Gaussian white noise plays active role in supporting and developing spiral wave in the networks of neurons, and appearance of smaller factor of synchronization indicates high possibility to induce spiral wave. © Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

78649778283	Parameter fluctuation-induced pattern transition in the complex Ginzburg-landau equation	Parameter fluctuation, which is often induced by the noise, temperature, deformation of the media etc., plays an important role in changing the dynamics of the system. In this paper, the problem of parameter fluctuation-induced pattern transition in the Complex GinzburgLandau equation (CGLE) is investigated. At first, the perpendicular-gradient initial values are used to generate spiral wave and spiral turbulence under appropriate parameters. At second, the parameter is perturbed with the periodical and/or random signal to simulate the parameter fluctuation, respectively. Then a class of linear error feedback is used to induce transition of the spiral wave and spiral turbulence. It is found that target waves can be induced by the complete feedback forcing, while the local feedback forcing seldom induce a target wave. In the case of spiral turbulence, spiral wave is generated and the spiral turbulence is removed by the new appeared spiral wave as the linear error feedback began to work on the whole media. Finally, the common negative feedback is also used to control the parameter-fluctuated CGLE, and the results are compared with the linear error feedback control, it is found that the whole system become homogeneous when the negative feedback is imposed on the whole media, and the local negative feedback can induce new target wave to remove the spiral wave while it is in vain to generate new target or spiral wave to overcome and eliminate the spiral turbulence. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

At first, appropriate initial values and reasonable parameters are used to induce spiral wave in the coupled HHn. The temperature and channel noise are also considered to induce the birth and transition of spiral wave, respectively. It is found that the spiral wave can be generated in the absence of channel noise, and the seed of spiral wave cannot grow up when the intensity of channel noise exceeds the threshold (the noise is distributed on all the channels and s describes the membrane patch, the threshold is suggested with s = 3.2). The spiral wave disappears and all the coupled HHn become homogeneous when the temperature exceeds the threshold about T = 22°C. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

Neurons are distributed in the sites of two-dimensional array, neurons are connected with complete nearest-neighbor connections, no-flux boundary conditions, appropriate initial values and physiological parameters are used to develop a stable rotating spiral wave. A statistic factor of synchronization is defined to discuss the transition and development of spiral wave in the two parameters space (membrane temperature T and forcing current I), and it is found that spiral wave keeps alive due to positive current forcing and the spiral wave can be removed completely when the temperature is increased to a threshold about T = 22.3 °C at a fixed current intensity. Periodical forcing current is imposed on the networks of neurons globally and locally, respectively. It is found that spiral wave could be suppressed by the new generated traveling wave or target wave when periodical forcing current is imposed on the border of networks of neurons, and the most effective frequency of the external forcing current is close to the intrinsic frequency of the spiral wave of the networks. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

78751489540	Channel noise-induced phase transition of spiral wave in networks of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons	The phase transition of spiral waves in networks of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons induced by channel noise is investigated in detail. All neurons in the networks are coupled with small-world connections, and the results are compared with the case for regular networks, in which all neurons are completely coupled with nearest-neighbor connections. A statistical variable is defined to study the collective behavior and phase transition of the spiral wave due to the channel noise and topology of the network. The effect of small-world connection networks is described by local regular networks and long-range connection with certain probability p. The numerical results confirm that (1) a stable rotating spiral wave can be developed and maintain robust with low p, where the breakup of the spiral wave and turbulence result from increasing the probability p to a certain threshold; (2) appropriate intensity of the optimized channel noise can develop a spiral wave among turbulent states in small-world connection networks of H-H neurons; and (3) regular connection networks are more robust to channel noise than small-world connection networks. A spiral wave in a small-world network encounters instability more easily as the membrane temperature is increased to a certain high threshold. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Within the chaotic parameter region, the complete synchronization, phase synchronization and parameters estimation are discussed in detail by using adaptive synchronization scheme and Lyapunov stability theory. Two changeable gain coefficients are introduced into the controllable positive Lyapunov function and thus the parameter observers. It is found that complete synchronization or phase synchronization occurs with different controllers being used though the parameter observers are the same. Phase synchronization is observed when zero eigenvalue of Jacobi matrix, which is composed of the errors of corresponding variables in the drive and driven chaotic systems.

It is found that the stable rotating spiral wave can be developed and the transition of spiral wave in the coupled HindmarshRose neurons are investigated. The factor of synchronization is defined to investigate the development and instability of the spiral wave. Furthermore, the external injected current, coupling coefficients and other decisive bifurcation parameter r and χ, are endowed with different values to study the transition of spiral wave by analyzing the factor of synchronization and the snapshots of the activator. It is found that the critical sudden change points in the curve for factor of synchronization often indicates sudden transition of spiral wave, the instability or death of the spiral wave. The snapshots are also plotted to confirm the results from the curve of the factor of synchronization. Finally, the noise-induced instability and chaotic logistic map-induced instability of spiral wave are investigated and discussed. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.

82255181597	Chaos control, spiral wave formation, and the emergence of spatiotemporal chaos in networked Chua circuits	In this paper, a certain kind of intermittent scheme is used to control the chaos in a single chaotic Chua circuit to reach an arbitrary orbit. Furthermore, it is confirmed to be effective in suppressing spatiotemporal chaos and a spiral wave in the networks of Chua circuits with nearest-neighbor connections. The controllable and measurable variable is sampled, and the linear error between the sampled variable and the selected thresholds is fed back into the system only if the sampled variable exceeds the thresholds; otherwise, the system will develop itself without any external perturbation. In experiments, the control scheme could be realized by using the Heavside function. In the case of one single chaotic Chua circuit, the chaotic state can be controlled to reach an arbitrary n-periodical orbit (n=1,2,3,5,6,⋯) with appropriate feedback intensity and thresholds. It is argued that this scheme could explain the mechanism of what is called phase compression. Then the phase compression scheme is used to control a spiral wave and spatiotemporal chaos in a network of Chua circuits with 256×256 sites. The numerical simulation results confirm its effectiveness when appropriate upper and bottom thresholds are used by monitoring the measurable output voltages of the chaotic circuit in one site of the network. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The regular networks of neurons are constructed in the two-dimensional space, the dynamical properties of thermosensitive neurons is described by temperature factor, and the effect of membrane temperature on the evolution of spiral wave is investigated in detail. A statistical factor of synchronization is defined to measure the critical condition inducing phase transition of spiral wave (death or breakup) by the factor of temperature of membrane. It is confirmed that spiral wave is removed and the whole networks become homogeneous and synchronous completely when the membrane temperature exceeds a certain threshold; the breakup of spiral wave is induced in the presence of weak channel noise being considered. Furthermore, it is suggested that the mechanism of temporary heat stupor could be the blocking of spiral wave propagation in some functional domain. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society.

84866139490	Simulating the electric activity of FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron by using Josephson junction model	The resistive-capacitive-inductance Josephson junction (RCLSJ) model can simulate the electric activities of neurons. In this paper, the RCLSJ system is controlled to reproduce the dynamical properties of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system neuron by using the improved adaptive synchronization scheme. Improved Lyapunov functions with two controllable gain coefficients (a,β) is constructed, and the controller is approached analytically to realize linear generalized synchronization defined as x = k x+C. The summation of error function during the process of synchronization and the power consumption of controller are calcu- lated in the dimensionless model to measure the effect of the two gain coefficients (a,β) by selecting different constants (k,C) to represent different kinds of generalized synchronization. The results are approached as follows: (1) the power consumption of the controller is independent of the selection of the two gain coefficients (a,β); (2) the synchronization region is marked in the phase space of the two gain coefficients; (3) the power consumption of controller is dependent on the selection of constants (k,C), smaller power consumption of the controller is required with larger k at fixed C; larger power consumption costs with larger C at fixed k. The specific case for C = 0, k = 1 is also discussed to understand the case for complete synchronization. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

84873566738	Emergence of spiral wave induced by defects block	The development of spiral wave in the regular network of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons with nearest-neighbor connection is investigated under no-flux and/or periodical boundary condition, respectively. At first, specific initial values are selected to detect the formation of spiral wave, it is found that the developed state is controlled by the bifurcation s, which controls the electric activity of neuron from spiking to burst behavior, and different developed states are observed. Furthermore, the formation of ordered wave induced by the defect block in the network of neurons is also investigated. In the numerical studies, the first step is to generate target-like wave by imposing a discrepant forcing current (not periodical signal) on a local region, the second step is to produce an artificial defect by setting the variables in a local area to zero. The supposed defect is used to block the propagation of target wave in the network, and the condition for spiral wave emergence is investigated in a numerical way. It indicates that the existence of defect in the media accounts for the emergence of spiral wave though most of the previous works used to simulate the development of spiral wave by using specific initial values. A statistical factor of synchronization in the two-dimensional space is defined to detect the appearance and robustness of spiral wave in the network of neurons. It is confirmed that the contour profile of the developed pattern is dependent on the intensity of coupling and defects block. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84873392209	Transition of ordered waves in neuronal network induced by diffusive poisoning of ion channels	Normal physiological activities are often affected by some drugs, and some ion channels are blocked due to the katogene of drugs. This paper investigates the propagation of ordered waves in neuronal networks induced by diffusive poisoning, where the process is measured by increasing the number of neurons in the poisoned area of the networks. A coefficient of poisoning K is defined to measure the time units from one poisoned site to the adjacent site, a smaller K means that more neurons are poisoned in a certain period (a higher poisoning speed). A statistical factor of synchronization R in the two-dimensional array is defined to detect the transition of spiral waves induced by ion channel blocking. It is confirmed that the evolution of the spiral waves depends on the coefficient of poisoning K and number of poisoned neurons. Furthermore, breakup of the spirals is observed when weak channel noise is considered. Finally, the formation of the spiral wave induced by blocking the target wave with line defects is briefly discussed. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84873142292	The Formation Mechanism of Defects, Spiral Wave in the Network of Neurons	A regular network of neurons is constructed by using the Morris-Lecar (ML) neuron with the ion channels being considered, and the potential mechnism of the formation of a spiral wave is investigated in detail. Several spiral waves are initiated by blocking the target wave with artificial defects and/or partial blocking (poisoning) in ion channels. Furthermore, possible conditions for spiral wave formation and the effect of partial channel blocking are discussed completely. Our results are summarized as follows. 1) The emergence of a target wave depends on the transmembrane currents with diversity, which mapped from the external forcing current and this kind of diversity is associated with spatial heterogeneity in the media. 2) Distinct spiral wave could be induced to occupy the network when the target wave is broken by partially blocking the ion channels of a fraction of neurons (local poisoned area), and these generated spiral waves are similar with the spiral waves induced by artificial defects. It is confirmed that partial channel blocking of some neurons in the network could play a similar role in breaking a target wave as do artificial defects; 3) Channel noise and additive Gaussian white noise are also considered, and it is confirmed that spiral waves are also induced in the network in the presence of noise. According to the results mentioned above, we conclude that appropriate poisoning in ion channels of neurons in the network acts as 'defects' on the evolution of the spatiotemporal pattern, and accounts for the emergence of a spiral wave in the network of neurons. These results could be helpful to understand the potential cause of the formation and development of spiral waves in the cortex of a neuronal system. © 2013 Wu, Ma.

The dynamics of each node of the network is described by a simplified Chua circuit, and nodes are uniformly placed in a two-dimensional array with nearest-neighbor connection type. The transition of spiral wave is detected by changing the coupling intensity, intensity and correlation time τ in the noise. A statistical variable is used to discern the parameter region for breakup of spiral wave and robustness to external noise. Spiral waves emerge in the network when the network with structure of complex-periodic and chaotic properties. It is found that asymmetric coupling can induce deformation of spiral wave, stronger intensity or smaller correlation time in noise does cause breakup of the spiral wave. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

84880044499	Development of spiral wave in a regular network of excitatory neurons due to stochastic poisoning of ion channels	Some experimental evidences show that spiral wave could be observed in the cortex of brain, and the propagation of this spiral wave plays an important role in signal communication as a pacemaker. The profile of spiral wave generated in a numerical way is often perfect while the observed profile in experiments is not perfect and smooth. In this paper, formation and development of spiral wave in a regular network of Morris-Lecar neurons, which neurons are placed on nodes uniformly in a two-dimensional array and each node is coupled with nearest-neighbor type, are investigated by considering the effect of stochastic ion channels poisoning and channel noise. The formation and selection of spiral wave could be detected as follows. (1) External forcing currents with diversity are imposed on neurons in the network of excitatory neurons with nearest-neighbor connection, a target-like wave emerges and its potential mechanism is discussed; (2) artificial defects and local poisoned area are selected in the network to induce new wave to interact with the target wave; (3) spiral wave can be induced to occupy the network when the target wave is blocked by the artificial defects or poisoned area with regular border lines; (4) the stochastic poisoning effect is introduced by randomly modifying the border lines (areas) of specific regions in the network. It is found that spiral wave can be also developed to occupy the network under appropriate poisoning ratio. The process of growth for the poisoned area of ion channels poisoning is measured, the effect of channels noise is also investigated. It is confirmed that perfect spiral wave emerges in the network under gradient poisoning even if the channel noise is considered. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84880822034	Selection of Multiarmed Spiral Waves in a Regular Network of Neurons	Formation and selection of multiarmed spiral wave due to spontaneous symmetry breaking are investigated in a regular network of Hodgkin-Huxley neuron by changing the excitability and imposing spatial forcing currents on the neurons in the network. The arm number of the multiarmed spiral wave is dependent on the distribution of spatial forcing currents and excitability diversity in the network, and the selection criterion for supporting multiarmed spiral waves is discussed. A broken spiral segment is measured by a short polygonal line connected by three adjacent points (controlled nodes), and a double-spiral wave can be developed from the spiral segment. Multiarmed spiral wave is formed when a group of double-spiral waves rotate in the same direction in the network. In the numerical studies, a group of controlled nodes are selected and spatial forcing currents are imposed on these nodes, and our results show that l-arm stable spiral wave (l = 2, 3, 4,..8) can be induced to occupy the network completely. It is also confirmed that low excitability is critical to induce multiarmed spiral waves while high excitability is important to propagate the multiarmed spiral wave outside so that distinct multiarmed spiral wave can occupy the network completely. Our results confirm that symmetry breaking of target wave in the media accounts for emergence of multiarmed spiral wave, which can be developed from a group of spiral waves with single arm under appropriate condition, thus the potential formation mechanism of multiarmed spiral wave in the media is explained. © 2013 Hu et al.

The heterogeneity is implemented by letting the diffusive coefficient in the heterogeneous area be different from the other area. The results show that fruitful transitions of the spiral tip trajectories are induced by the fractal heterogeneity. In particular, when the heterogeneity increases to a sufficiently high level the spiral tip trajectory always changes to a stable rotating trajectory (closed-circle tip trajectory), whatever transitions have been induced by a lower level of heterogeneity. We qualitatively ascribe the transitions to the attraction on the spiral tip exerted by the heterogeneous area. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84890598529	Quantifying the attractive force exerted on the pinned calcium spiral waves by using the adventive field	The cytosolic calcium system is inhomogenous because of the discrete and random distribution of ion channels on the ER membrane. It is well known that the spiral tip can be pinned by the heterogenous area, and the field can detach the spiral from the heterogeneity. We use the adventive field to counteract the attractive force exerting on the calcium spiral wave by the heterogeneity, then the strength of the adventive field is used to quantify the attractive force indirectly. Two factors determining the attractive force are studied. It is found that: (1) the attractive force sharply increases with size of the heterogeneity for small-size heterogeneity, whereas the force increases to a saturated value for large-size heterogeneity; (2) for large-size heterogeneity, the force almost remains constant unless the level of the heterogeneity vanishes, the force decreases to zero linearly and sharply, and for small-size heterogeneity, the force decreases successively with the level of the heterogeneity. Furthermore, it is found that the forces exist only when the spiral tip is very close to the heterogenous area. Our study may shed some light on the control or suppression of the calcium spiral wave. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84891307182	Effect of inhomogeneous distribution of ion channels on collective electric activities of neurons in a ring network	In this paper, we investigate the evolution and transition of collective electric activities of neurons in a ring network, induced by inhomogeneous distribution of ion channels. The local kinetics is measured by Morris-Lecar under voltage coupling type. In the numerical studies, the effect of inhomogeneous distribution of ion channels is simulated by changing the conductance in ion channels embedded in the membrane, and the potential mechanism is discussed. The effect of diversity of conductance between calcium and potassium ions on the activating of the adjacent neurons, and the dependence of developed travelling wave on the coupling intensity, are investigated in detail. The activating and waking up the nonexcitable or quiescent neurons with type I and type II excitability, are investigated, respectively. The numerical results confirm that the adjacent neurons are activated and the stable travelling wave is developed in the ring network of neurons when the conductance of calcium ions is increased beyond a certain threshold or the conductance of potassium ions is reduced below another threshold, while the propagation of the travelling wave could be slowed down or suppressed when the conductance of calcium ions is reduced or the conductance of potassium ion is increased. The development or emergence of travelling wave and propagation are greatly dependent on the increase of conductance of calcium ions and the decrease of potassium conductance. © Chinese Physical Society.

Findings indicate the following: 1) the value of the attractive force is about a few tens that of the repulsive force for different parameter values; 2) the repulsive and attractive forces always increase with the level of heterogeneity; and 3) compared with the size of the heterogeneous area, the level of heterogeneity influences the forces more significantly. © Copyright EPLA, 2013.

Our results show that when the successive spikes are produced in neuron 1 (N1), the bursting-like spikes (BLSs) occur in two neurons simultaneously during the spikes being transferred to neuron 2 (N2). The existence of the astrocyte and a higher expression level of mGluRs facilitate the occurrence of BLSs, but the rate of occurrence is not sensitive to the parameters. Furthermore, time delay τ occurs during the information transmission, and τ is almost independent of the effect of the astrocyte. Additionally, we found that low coupling strength may result in the distortion of the information, and this distortion is also proven to be almost independent of the astrocyte. © 2013 Tang et al.

84901022655	Dynamics of electric activities in neuron and neurons of network induced by autapses	The effect of autapse on adjusting the membrane of potentials of neuron is described by imposing a time-delayed feedback on the membrane of neuron in a close loop type, and the Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neuron under autapse is investigated. Firstly, the electric activity of single HR neuron under electric autapse and chemical autapse is investigated. It is found that quiescent neuron is activated due to appropriate time delay and feedback gain in the autapse, and the autapse plays an important role in waking up neuron. The parameter region for periodic, chaotic activity of neuron under autapse is calculated in a numerical way, and transition from spiking to bursting is observed by increasing the feedback gain and time delay carefully. Furthermore, the collective electric activities of neurons in a ring network is investigated and abundant electric activities are observed due to the competition between the autapse and the time-delayed coupling between adjacent neurons in the network, and time delay in coupling between neurons also plays an important role in enhancing synchronization in the network. © 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84902545269	Selection of multi-scroll attractors in Jerk circuits and their verification using Pspice	In this paper, a feasible feedback scheme is used to stabilize the multi-scroll attractors in the Jerk circuit, and the controller is realized using mixed Heaviside function. It is found that arbitrary number (n = 2, 3, 4, 5, ...) of multi-scroll attractors can be selected from a controlled Jerk circuit, and these multi-scroll attractors can be reproduced using Pspice. The implementation of circuit and controller using Pspice is also presented. The potential mechanism could be that an external forcing in the Sine type is practical to generate a group of equilibrium points, and a linear controller composed of Heaviside function is effective to stabilize the n -scroll attractors in the chaotic systems. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84903388366	Autapse-induced spiral wave in network of neurons under noise	Autapse plays an important role in regulating the electric activity of neuron by feedbacking time-delayed current on the membrane of neuron. Autapses are considered in a local area of regular network of neurons to investigate the development of spatiotemporal pattern, and emergence of spiral wave is observed while it fails to grow up and occupy the network completely. It is found that spiral wave can be induced to occupy more area in the network under optimized noise on the network with periodical or no-flux boundary condition being used. The developed spiral wave with self-sustained property can regulate the collective behaviors of neurons as a pacemaker. To detect the collective behaviors, a statistical factor of synchronization is calculated to investigate the emergence of ordered state in the network. The network keeps ordered state when self-sustained spiral wave is formed under noise and autapse in local area of network, and it independent of the selection of periodical or no-flux boundary condition. The developed stable spiral wave could be helpful for memory due to the distinct self-sustained property. © 2014 Qin et al.

84905843006	Liberation of a pinned spiral wave by a rotating electric pulse	Spiral waves may be pinned to anatomical heterogeneities in the cardiac tissue, which leads to monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Wave emission from heterogeneities (WEH) induced by electric pulses in one direction (EP) is a promising method for liberating such waves by using heterogeneities as internal virtual pacing sites. Here, based on the WEH effect, a new mechanism of liberation by means of a rotating electric pulse (REP) is proposed in a generic model of excitable media. Compared with the EP, the REP has the advantage of opening wider time window to liberate pinned spiral. The influences of rotating direction and frequency of the REP, and the radius of the obstacles on this new mechanism are studied. We believe this strategy may improve manipulations with pinned spiral waves in heart experiments. © CopyrightEPLA, 2014.

84906534331	Realizing hybrid synchronization of time-delay hyperchaotic 4D systems via partial variables	Hybrid synchronization of time-delay hyperchaotic 4D systems with different initial conditions is investigated via partial variables. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are given to get the hybrid synchronization by constructing a novel Lyapunov function in the form of exponential form. It is proved that some partial state variables of two time-delay hyperchaotic systems are anti-synchronized, while other state variables are complete synchronized, when one or two linear controllers are imposed on the response system. Simultaneously, the unknown parameters in the response system are also estimated completely. Numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed chaos synchronization scheme.© 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84906782683	Autapse-induced target wave, spiral wave in regular network of neurons	Autapse is a type of synapse that connects axon and dendrites of the same neuron, and the effect is often detected by close-loop feedback in axonal action potentials to the owned dendritic tree. An artificial autapse was introduced into the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model, and a regular network was designed to detect the regular pattern formation induced by autapse. It was found that target wave emerged in the network even when only a single autapse was considered. By increasing the (autapse density) number of neurons with autapse, for example, a regular area (2×2, 3×3, 4×4, 5×5 neurons) under autapse induced target wave by selecting the feedback gain and time-delay in autapse. Spiral waves were also observed under optimized feedback gain and time delay in autapses because of coherence-like resonance in the network induced by some electric autapses connected to some neurons. This confirmed that the electric autapse has a critical role in exciting and regulating the collective behaviors of neurons by generating stable regular waves (target waves, spiral waves) in the network. The wave length of the induced travelling wave (target wave, spiral wave), because of local effect of autapse, was also calculated to understand the waveprofile in the network of neurons. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

84916240945	Dislocation coupling-induced transition of synchronization in two-layer neuronal networks	The mutual coupling between neurons in a realistic neuronal system is much complex, and a two-layer neuronal network is designed to investigate the transition of electric activities of neurons. The Hindmarsh - Rose neuron model is used to describe the local dynamics of each neuron, and neurons in the two-layer networks are coupled in dislocated type. The coupling intensity between two-layer networks, and the coupling ratio (Pro), which defines the percentage involved in the coupling in each layer, are changed to observe the synchronization transition of collective behaviors in the two-layer networks. It is found that the two-layer networks of neurons becomes synchronized with increasing the coupling intensity and coupling ratio (Pro) beyond certain thresholds. An ordered wave in the first layer is useful to wake up the rest state in the second layer, or suppress the spatiotemporal state in the second layer under coupling by generating target wave or spiral waves. And the scheme of dislocation coupling can be used to suppress spatiotemporal chaos and excite quiescent neurons.
