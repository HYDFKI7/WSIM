33947252483	A novel particle swarm optimization algorithm for solving transportation problem	The transportation problem (TP) is well known as a basic network problem for it could be extensively applied in many fields. The linear transportation problem (LTP), which is the core and basic model of TP, can be extended to other TP with higher complexity. In the present paper, a new particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO-TP) whose special structure and operators are different from the classical PSO is given for the solution to LTP. A new position updating rule and a negative repair operator of PSO-TP can help to meet the constraints of LTP, which consequently saves much computational cost to find the feasible solution. Moreover, a mutation operator is added to enable PSO-TP not to finish searching prematurely. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, through the comparison with Vignaux and Michalewicz's genetic algorithm (GA) and the performance in solving open problems. © 2006 IEEE.

37849041051	A particle swarm optimization algorithm with crossover operator	Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a method for tackling optimization functions. However, it is easily trapped into the local optimization when solving high-dimension functions. To overcome this shortcoming, a modified particle swarm optimization is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, a crossover step is added to the standard PSO. The crossover is taken between each particle's individual best position. After the crossover, the fitness of the individual best position is compared with that of the two offspring, and the best one is taken as the new individual best position. The crossover can help the particles jump out of the local optimization by sharing the others' information. The experiment on five benchmark functions shows that the modified PSO is more effective to find the global optimal solution than other methods. © 2007 IEEE.

37849054067	A particle swarm optimization algorithm with differential evolution	Differential evolution (DE) is a simple evolutionary algorithm that has shown superior performance in the global continuous optimization. It mainly utilizes the differential information to guide its further search. But the differential information also results in instability of performance. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been developing rapidly and has been applied widely since it is introduced, as it can converge quickly. But PSO easily got stuck in local optima because it easily loses the diversity of swarm. This paper proposes a combination of DE and PSO (termed DEPSO) that makes up their disadvantages. DEPSO combines the differential information obtained by DE with the memory information extracted by PSO to create the promising solutions. Finally, DEPSO is tested to solve several benchmark optimization problems. The experimental results show the effectiveness of DEPSO algorithm for the multimodal function, and also verify that DEPSO can perform better than other algorithms (DE, CPSO) in solving the benchmark problems. © 2007 IEEE.

59549090696	Time complexity of evolutionary programming	As a method of evolutionary computation, evolutionary programming(EP) algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm for continuous optimization problems. The convergence of EP has been proved, but there are few studies on the time complexity of EP, which is one of the hard problems in evolutionary computation. EP algorithm can be modeled as an absorbing Markov process because of its comparison selection. The item called average convergence time is used to propose a method to analyze the time complexity of EP algorithm based on absorbing Markov process model. The average convergence time can be calculated with the probability that the EP algorithm attains the optimal solution in the next iteration but not in the current iteration. A direct approach to estimate the convergence time is given as a theorem. Furthermore, the corollaries of the theorem indicate the way to estimate the bounds of the convergence time. The convergence time reveals how many iteration times the EP algorithm uses to converge to the optimal solution. Therefore, the proposed theorem and corollaries can be considered as the time complexity theory for the foundation of evolutionary programming. Finally, the average convergence time of Gauss-mutation evolutionary programming is analyzed as an application case study of the proposed theory.

There are several mathematical and computational methods for linear transportation problem (LTP). However, the approaches cannot be used in solving non-linear transportation problems (NLTP) directly. In the present paper, an evolutionary algorithm (EA-TP), with recombination and mutation operators, is proposed for the solution to NLTP. The recombination of EA-TP can lead individuals to optimal solution, meeting the supply, demand and positive constraints in TP. Moreover, the mutation operator enables EA-TP not to finish searching prematurely. The numerical experiments of solving the NLTP instances based on open problems show the effectiveness and efficiency of EA-TP through the comparison with EP with penalty strategy and GA in the literature.

80055064646	Example-based learning particle swarm optimization for continuous optimization	Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a heuristic optimization technique based on swarm intelligence that is inspired by the behavior of bird flocking. The canonical PSO has the disadvantage of premature convergence. Several improved PSO versions do well in keeping the diversity of the particles during the searching process, but at the expense of rapid convergence. This paper proposes an example-based learning PSO (ELPSO) to overcome these shortcomings by keeping a balance between swarm diversity and convergence speed. Inspired by a social phenomenon that multiple good examples can guide a crowd towards making progress, ELPSO uses an example set of multiple global best particles to update the positions of the particles. In this study, the particles of the example set were selected from the best particles and updated by the better particles in the first-in-first-out order in each iteration. The particles in the example set are different, and are usually of high quality in terms of the target optimization function. ELPSO has better diversity and convergence speed than single-gbest and non-gbest PSO algorithms, which is proved by mathematical and numerical results. Finally, computational experiments on benchmark problems show that ELPSO outperforms all of the tested PSO algorithms in terms of both solution quality and convergence time. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The classic bloom filter has the disadvantage of importing false positive, sacrificing its correctness. Several improved bloom filter variations do well in reducing false positive rate, but at the expense of increased memory usage. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Bloom Filter (HBF) to overcome these drawbacks by taking advantage of the hierarchical structure of URLs as well as the working principle of web crawler. HBF uses multiple level bloom filters to reduce the false positive rate. Several experiments show that the HBF can largely reduce the space usage in a web crawler while the false positive rate remains the same stage. © 2012 by Binary Information Press.

84867556656	A memetic algorithm applied to allocation problem of the concrete mixing plants	This paper addresses the allocation problem of the concrete mixing plants (APCMP). We present a memetic algorithm with the combination of ant colony optimization and greedy algorithm to solve the problem. Ant colony optimization is used to achieve the global search, and greedy algorithm based on the shortest distance of the sites is introduced to proceed the local search. It can be obtained the optimization solution to guarantee minimum the total transport distances. In the end, through the experiment, the results show that memetic algorithm is better to solve the APCMP problem than the single greedy algorithm based on the shortest distance. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84874325009	An algorithm for automatic detection of banners in surveillance videos	In this paper we mainly focus on the effects of two different algorithms for automatic detection of banners in practical use. These two algorithms are scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and Hough transform-based contour feature extraction method, respectively. A new algorithm based on color threshold and corner detector is described. This algorithm can capture color features and corner of images effectively, especially for objects with certain color such as bright red banners. The experimental results indicate that we can obtain the most stable and effective structure element characteristic in images when applying the algorithm based on color threshold and corner detector. © 2012 IEEE.

84875107905	Fast mixed strategy differential evolution using effective mutant vector pool	The mutant vector has significant influence on the performance of Differential Evolution (DE). Different mutant vector always generates different result, one outstanding mutant vector for a specify problem perhaps achieve unbearable bad result for another question. There still no one perfect mutant vector can solve all problems excellently. In this situation, mixed strategy method is proposed to improve the performance of DE by combining multi-effective mutant vectors together. This paper proposes a fast mixed strategy DE (FMDE). The new method uses two best mutant vectors selected from the mutant vector pool and applies a fast mixed method to generate better result without increase computing expense. The FMDE is evaluated by 27 benchmarks selected from Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) competition. The experiment result shows FMDE is competitive, stable and comprehensive. abstract environment. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84875090261	Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on layer strategy	In view of the unsatisfactory search performance of binary crossing operator as well as the elitist-preserving approach's influence on the population's diversity, an algorithm of multi-objective based on layer strategy and self-adaptive crossing distribution index is put forward on the basis of research and analysis on NSGA-II algorithm. The algorithm will be applied to the ZDT series test functions. The experiment results show that the improved algorithm maintains the diversity and distribution of population. Compared with NSGA-II, the Pareto front we get is much closer to the true Pareto optimal front. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84880359361	Improved evolutionary programming algorithm based on heuristic mutation	The common evolutionary programming (EP) algorithms are of poor robustness because they perform the mutation based on a fixed probability distribution. In this paper, first, the influence of mutation operators on the computational efficiency of evolutionary programming algorithms is analyzed, and the essential drawback of Gauss, Cauchy and Lévy mutation operators, namely the lack of heuristic information, is pointed out. Then, a heuristic mutation operator based on the differential information among individuals is designed, which uses the difference between two individuals to update the mutated variables and to provide chances for an individual to maintain its status quo in some dimensions. With the help of the proposed heuristic mutation operator, evolutionary programming algorithms can adapt to different continuous optimization problems and the algorithm robustness improves. Numerical experiments of several Benchmark problems demonstrate that the improved evolutionary programming algorithm based on heuristic mutation is of higher convergence speed and better average performance than six other evolutionary algorithms based on probability distribution.

84884770338	Multi-objective differential evolution algorithm based on adaptive mutation and partition selection	A multi-objective differential evolution algorithm based on adaptive mutation strategies and partition selected search is proposed based on classical differential evolution (DE) to further improve the convergence and diversity of multi-objective optimization problems. This algorithm improves mutation operation in DE, makes search oriented and ensures the convergence of algorithm by adaptively selecting mutation strategies based on the non-inferiority of the individuals of the population in evolution. In addition, a partition-based elitist preserving mechanism is applied to select the best individuals for the next generation, thus improving the selection operation in DE and maintaining the diversity of Pareto optimal set. The experiment on 5 ZDT test functions and 3 DTLZ test functions and comparison with and analysis of other classical algorithms such as NSGA-II and SPEA2 show that this algorithm converges the populations towards non-inferior frontier rapidly on the premise of maintaining the diversity of the populations. From the measure and graphs, it can be seen that this algorithm is feasible and effective in solving the multi-objective optimization problems. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

84886246355	Image matching application based on modified SURF algorithm	The key technique to increase the accuracy of electronic marking is the technique of image matching, namely to match two doubtfully duplicate images. Currently there are few technologies aiming for features on test paper images with high performance on matching accuracy. The research is based on SURF algorithm and specific to the features of test paper images. Thus the research is to put forward the modified algorithm with constraints among feature spots of orientation angles on their geometrical positions, including differential constraints on critical points from approximate blank test papers with less individual features at the same time. After processing and analyzing 2,000 test paper gathered from one actual examination, the results show that the modified detection algorithm has 100% false rejection rate and 100% accuracy when it is used to detect the test paper matching. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84891362936	An evolutionary algorithm based on constraint set partitioning for nurse rostering problems	The nurse rostering problem (NRP) is a representative of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. The hardness of NRP is mainly due to its multiple complex constraints. Several approaches, which are based on an evolutionary algorithm (EA) framework and integrated with a penalty-function technique, were proposed in the literature to handle the constraints found in NRP. However, these approaches are not very efficient in dealing with large-scale NPR instances and thus need to be improved upon. In this paper, we investigate a large-scale NRP in a real-world setting, i.e., Chinese NRP (CNRP), which requires us to arrange many nurses (up to 30) across a 1-month scheduling period. The CNRP poses various constraints that lead to a large solution space with multiple isolated areas of infeasible solutions. We propose a single-individual EA for the CNRP. The novelty of the proposed approach is threefold: (1) using a constraint separation to partition the constraints into hard and soft constraints; (2) using a revised integer programming to generate a high-quality initial individual (solution), which then leads the subsequent EA search to a promising feasible solution space; and (3) using an efficient mutation operator to quickly search for a better solution in the restricted feasible solution space. The experimental results based on extensive simulations indicate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms several existing representative algorithms, in terms of solution quality within the same calculation times of the objective function. © 2014 Springer-Verlag London.

84898679141	Global convergence and premature convergence of two-membered evolution strategy	The theory of discrete state Markov chain has been applied widely to the analysis of convergence and time complexity of the evolutionary algorithms, and the application of the theory of continuous state Markov process is relatively few and not systematic due to the adoption of some profound mathematical tools. In this article, we introduce the theory of continuous state Markov process, use the measure theory and conditional mathematical expectation theory as tools to deduce a key calculation formula of the transition probability. We analyze the convergence property of the continuous evolutionary algorithms represented by (1+1)ES; prove theoretically that a wide class of common mutation distributions including normal distribution and Cauchy distribution, if satisfying some specified conditions which are not difficult to meet in practice, can cause (1+1)ES to converge in probability to the ε-vicinity of global optimum if the constant mutation operator is adopted; construct a function with fitness plateau and prove theoretically that some self-adaptive mutation operators can plunge (1+1)ES into premature convergence even if normal distribution and Cauchy distribution are adopted as mutation distribution. The theoretical analysis is validated by simulation experiment. The results show that self-adaptive mechanism is not always effective, and the scale factor should be selected properly.

84907276994	A variant of variable-drift theorem for continuous (1+1)-evolutionary algorithm	The computational time complexity is an important topic in the theory of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). The analysis in continuous space function is rare nowadays in comparison to that in discrete space. In this paper, we extend the general drift theory to analyze the complexity of optimization problem in continuous space, by proposing a new version of Variable Drift-Johannsen theorem. Comparing with general drift analysis, we establish a tighter upper bound for continuous optimization by integration for every problem that is monotonic in drift. Finally, we apply the proposed theory to a continuous (1+1)EA algorithm which is the basic framework of evolutionary algorithm(EA) in continuous space. The continuous (1+1)EA is similar with (1+1)EA except for its elitism strategy. In addition, its solutions are transferred to continuous space and mutations are implemented randomly by obeying one single probability distribution. It means that the continuous (1+1)EA requires exponential time complexity. Both the upper and lower bounds of the (1+1)EA with the mutation of (0,1)-normal distribution are bounding above that of the (1+1)EA with the mutation of (¿1,1)-uniform distribution. This means that the (1+1)EA with the mutation of (0,1)-normal distribution outperforms the (1+1)EA with the mutation of (¿1,1)-uniform distribution in reaching the optimum of sphere function.
