70749152385	Step memory polynomial predistorter for power amplifiers with memory	To reduce the number of digital predistortion coefficients, a step memory polynomial(SMP) predistorter is presented. The number of predistortion coefficients is decreased by adjusting the maximum nonlinear order for different memory orders in the traditional memory polynomial(MP) predistorter. The proposed SMP predistorter is identified by an offline learning structure on which the coefficients can be extracted directly from the sampled input and output of a PA. Simulation results show that the SMP predistorter is not tied to a particular PA model and is, therefore, robust. The effectiveness of the SMP predistorter is demonstrated by simulations and experiments on an MP model, a parallel Wiener model, a Wiener-Hammerstein model, a sparse-delay memory polynomial model and a real PA which is fabricated based on the Freescale LDMOSFET MRF21030.Compared with the traditional MP predistorter, the SMP predistorter can reduce the number of coefficients by 60%.

First, a dual-band transformer with a flexible transmission line stub, which can be fabricated by a shorted-circuit stub or an open-circuit stub, for two arbitrary real impedances is analyzed, and the rigorous design method is obtained. It is necessary to apply the asymmetric structure in all unequal power dividers in order to obtain unequal power dividing; thus, an asymmetric structure, which consists of two equivalent asymmetric dual-band transformers with a parallel transmission line stub in the input matching part, is developed for an unequal dual-band power divider. A resistor is then used in this proposed power divider, as the effective isolation structure to obtain ideal isolation between two output ports while two-section transmission line transformers are applied to match impedances at two output ports.

By using this method, the power divider could be designed to be arbitrary-way (N-way) with arbitrary power division, and arbitrary dual-band operations in a pure planar structure. A previous dual-band unequal Wilkinson power divider is extended to arbitrary terminal impedances case, thus, it can be used to construct multiway planar power dividers through the combination of the two-section dual-frequency transformers.

This recombinant structure consists of a two-way dual-band unequal power divider/combiner without any isolation structures. Furthermore, the complete design procedures and analytical equations of these proposed generalized power dividers are presented. To verify our proposed design approach in theory, several three-way and four-way power dividers with different dual-band applications and various power divisions are designed and simulated.

84864199568	A new accurate volterra-based model for behavioral modeling and digital predistortion of RF power amplifiers	A new accurate Volterra-based model is introduced for behavioral modeling and digital predistortion (DPD) of power amplifiers (PAs). This model extends the GMP model with specific cross terms, and these augmented terms significantly increase the model"s performance. The proposed model"s performance is assessed using a LDMOS Doherty PA driven by two modulated signals (a 4-carrier WCDMA signal and a single carrier 16QAM signal). The experimental results in both behavioral modeling and DPD applications demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the hybrid memory polynomial-envelope memory polynomial (HME) model and generalized memory polynomial (GMP) model. Compared with the HME model, the proposed model shows an average normalized mean square error (NMSE) improvement of 2.2 dB in the behavioral modeling, average adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) improvement of 2.8/2.5 dB in the DPD application, and 20% reduction in the number of coefficients. In comparison with the GMP model, the proposed model achieves higher model accuracy and better DPD performance, but reduces approximately 40% of coefficients.

84865815450	A dual-band impedance transformer using Pi-section structure for frequency-dependent complex loads	In this paper, a new approach to build a dual-band impedance transformer is presented. The transformer can handle impedances that are complex and vary with frequency. This transformer contains a Pi-section structure, which can be equivalent to having two different electrical lengths at the two operating frequencies. One of the electrical lengths serves as complementary angle of the other. In this way, the conjugate impedances obtained through previous process are transformed to real impedance concurrently. All parameters are derived from closed-form equations. In addition, several simulations as well as a fabricated power amplifier (PA) are presented to verify the proposed transformer. The measured result performs a good agreement with the simulated one in return loss and gain. This transformer may find use in different stages of a transceiver such as power amplifiers which operate at two independent frequencies.
