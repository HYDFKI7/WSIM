21144437320	Method of extending error-correcting capability of some BCH codes	A simple decoding algorithm to improve the error-correcting capability of some BCH codes by searching the relation tables is presented. It is found out that all the error patterns whose weights are equal to t + 1 and that BCH (n, k, t) codes can correct. Then these error patterns and those whose weights are less than t + 1 are ordered according to their corresponding syndrome values. The ordered error patterns are optimized to be stored in hardware devices so that decoding can be realized by searching the relation tables. The simulation results show that when the code bits and information bits are the same, this decoding method can correct more error bits than usual decoding methods. The decoding circuits are comparatively simpler and the decoding speeds are faster. This decoding method of improving the error-correcting capability is applicable to all binary linear cyclic codes.

21144450386	Modeling and emulation for mobile communications fading channel	Several characteristics of mobile communications channel, such as Doppler spread, flat fading and frequency-selective fading are analyzed in detail. The implementation of the deterministic model for Rician channel is proposed by combining finite harmonics with equal frequency interval and randomly distributed phases, while the implementation of the stochastic model for Rician channel is proposed by adjusting the filter configuration and parameters to transform the white Gaussian noise into colored Gaussian stochastic process. A minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion is employed to figure out the model parameters based on random power spectrum. The experimental system for mobile communications fading channel is developed and simulated by Matlab. Simulation results show that the two proposed models achieve good performance and have lower complexity; especially the simulation results of the deterministic model are close to the theoretical parameters when the harmonic number is eight.

The results from theoretical analysis and simulations indicate that the cyclostationary characteristics of the strong interference in the received signal is exhibited mainly in the environment of the strong interference. Compared with the traditional techniques based on linear predictions in time domain, smaller time average-mean square errors can be achieved, the spectrum-correlated interference can be estimated and eliminated more exactly, and the impairment to the desired signal is mitigated. The bit error rate of the system is reduced further, so better interference suppression performance can be achieved. The advantage is more evident especially when the interference is stronger or the frequency band of the interference is wider.

Different from the common Ad-hoc networks, energy efficient routing protocol is the most important issue in WSNs. LEPS (Link Estimation and Parent Selection) is the routing protocol used in the TinyOS, which is widely used in many kinds of WSNs platforms. But in LEPS protocol, a node may always choose the same node as its next hop node. This may lead to the early death of the next hop node. To avoid this advantage, this paper presents a new protocol RPLRE (Routing Protocol based on LQI and Residual Energy) based on the LEPS protocol. RPLRE protocol uses the method of probability selection and takes residual energy into account when choosing next hop node. This can effectively avoid the disadvantage of LEPS. Simulation results show that RPLRE protocol can balance the energy consumption of nodes and prolong the lifetime of network. ©2009 IEEE.

Simulation results show that P-BM can efficiently reduce the number of the broadcast messages and enhance the promptness of message delivery, resulting in the decrease of latency and collision between vehicles. ©2009 IEEE.

79951733288	Adaptive spectrum sensing scheme with punishing mechanism in cognitive radio networks	A cognitive radio(CR) system exploits spectrum bands that primary users (PUs) are licensed to use. The CR perform spectrum sensing to find spectrum opportunities. In cognitive radio networks, secondary users (SUs) must sense the licensed channel at proper time in order to avoid interfering with the primary users, while SUs must also transmit data effectively. In conventional spectrum sensing schemes, the sensing time was fixed, which required a long sensing time to detect the weak signal of the PUs. In this paper, basing on the double-threshold energy detection algorithm, we propose an adaptive spectrum sensing scheme with punishing mechanism(ASSP). The scheme adaptively adjusts the sensing time and two thresholds according to the current and previous sensing results. The scheme can not only decreases the sensing cost but also improves the sensing performances. Besides, in order to further decrease the sensing cost and increase the channel utilization ratio, a punishing mechanism is given. The simulation results show that the adaptive scheme significantly outperforms the conventional schemes. © 2010 IEEE.

In ML (Maximum Likelihood) detection algorithm, frame synchronization can be completed by huge computation loads due to correlation operations between the received subframe lasting 6400chips and all 32 SYNC-DL sequences. This novel algorithm compresses the position range of SYNC-DL sequence in a subframe, and we call this step the initial frame synchronization.

Three coexisting models (overlay, underlay and interleave) were presented in recent literature. In this study, the authors propose a hybrid cognitive network model with overlay and underlay models, whereby a primary link leases its fractions of transmission time to the secondary users for their cooperation (i.e. these nodes form as a virtual multiple input multiple output (VMIMO) group) under the outage constraints of the primary and secondary systems. A new cooperative protocol between primary and secondary users is presented. The authors attempt to achieve the maximum transmission capacity of the secondary users under the primary and secondary outage constraints, which depend on the secondary density in the cognitive network. This study gives the upper bound density of the secondary transmitters that are modelled as a homogeneous marked Poisson point process. The maximum density is achieved by computing an optimal set of system parameters such as power control factor of the secondary user and the dirty paper coding (DPC) parameter. Simulation results illustrate that the maximum secondary density obtained using VMIMO is superior to that obtained by direct primary transmission. © 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

84863058282	Adaptive double-threshold energy detection algorithm for cognitive radio	Due to the fact that the conventional spectrum sensing algorithm is susceptible to noise, an adaptive double-threshold energy detection algorithm for a cognitive radio is proposed. Based on double-threshold energy detection, the algorithm can adaptively switch between one-round sensing and two-round sensing by comparing the observations with the pre-fixed thresholds. Mathematical expressions for the probability of detection, the probability of false alarm, and the sensing time are derived. The relationships including signal to noise ratio (SNR) vs. the probability of detection and SNR vs. the sensing time are plotted using Monte Carlo simulation and the algorithm is verified in a real cognitive system based on GNU Radio and universal software radio peripheral (USRP). Simulation and experimental results show that, compared with the existing spectrum sensing method, the proposed algorithm can achieve a higher probability of detection within a reasonable sensing time. © Copyright.

0036825780	High-speed AFH scheme and its performance analysis in WPAN systems	This paper presents a scheme applying the adaptive frequency hopping (AFH) technique to wireless personal area network (WPAN) system in which works on the complex interference environment and the performance of the bit error rate (BER) for some WPAN systems using AFH technique are analyzed. The background of WPAN system and the typical interference in WPAN environment were discussed. The theoretical analysis of the BER characteristics for this scheme was given. The simulation of the cases of data rates commonly used in 1600 hops/s was performed by taking 802.15.1 (Bluetooth) and 802.15.3 systems as examples. The results show that the AFH technique improves the BER performance of the WPAN systems nearly 1-2 order of magnitude when these systems work in the same frequency band within a small area. The results are also applicable for other WPAN systems using high-speed frequency hopping technique.

84873166350	QoS-based MAC protocol for cognitive radio networks	In order to improve the throughput performance of the secondary users (SUs) in the cognitive radio (CR) environment, a quality of service (QoS) based media access control (MAC) protocol is proposed. In this protocol, the CR node maps the channel state as a vector, and the transmitter and the receiver obtain the final channel map through an AND operation to prepare for an optional channel set. Data from the upper application layer are classified into two priority levels according to the QoS requirement. The data of each level relate to different contention windows so that the priority of real time data can be guaranteed. A two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain is utilized to evaluate the system performance, and mathematical expressions of the system throughput are derived. Simulation results show that compared with the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF), the proposed MAC protocol can achieve higher throughput. © right.

84881572048	Optimal sensing time of soft decision cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks	Spectrum sensing is a key feasible technology for cognitive radio (CR). Sensing time is an important sensing parameter which brings about a sensing-throughput tradeoff. In this paper, based on soft decision schemes, we investigate the sensing-throughput tradeoff problem and analyze the impact of different system parameters on the optimal sensing time for cooperative spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that maximal ratio combination g (MRC) and modified deflection coefficient (MDC) schemes have almost the same performance which outperform equal gain combination (EGC) scheme. Further, optimal sensing time decreases with the increase of number of CR users and increases when average signal-noise-ratio (SNR) decreases. © 2013 IEEE.

84881574018	Analysis of cumulative handoff delay for graded secondary users in cognitive radio networks	According to the fact that the secondary users' delay requirements for data transmission are not unitary in cognitive radio networks, the secondary users are divided into two classes, denoted by SU1 and SU2, respectively. It is assumed that SU1 has a higher priority to occupy the primary users' unutilized channels than SU2.A preemptive resume priority M/G/1 queuing network is used to model the multiple spectrum handoffs processing. By using a state transition probability matrix and a cost matrix, the average cumulative delays of SU1 and SU2 are calculated, respectively. Numerical results show that the more the primary user's traffic load, the more rapidly the SU2's cumulative handoff delay grows. Compared with the networks where secondary users are unitary, the lower the SU1's arrival rate, the more obviously both SU1's and SU2's handoff delays decrease. The admission access regions limited by the maximum tolerable delay can also facilitate the design of admission control rules for graded secondary users. © Copy Right.

84881076180	Modeling for spectrum handoff based on secondary users with different priorities in cognitive radio networks	Storaci-Cognitive radio (CR) can improve spectrum utilization by allowing the secondary users to temporarily access the primary user's unutilized licensed spectrum. In fact, the secondary users' delay requirements for data transmission would be not unitary. Some secondary users' communications may be delay-sensitive such as VoIP service while some others may not such as uploading a large file. In this paper, secondary users are divided into two classes, class-1 secondary user denoted by SUI and class-2 secondary user denoted by SU2. Suppose SUI has a higher priority than SU2 to occupy the channels. In order to characterize the cumulative handoff delay of the secondary users with different priorities, a Markov transition model integrating with the preemptive resume priority (PRP) M/M/2 queuing network is investigated. The numerical results compare the handoff delay between the unitary secondary users and different priorities secondary users. The analysis of the admission region for SUI and SU2 can also facilitate the designs of admission control rules according to the latency delay requirements of different transmission services. © 2012 IEEE.

84890065213	Variational inference of Kalman filter and its application in wireless sensor networks	An improved Kalman filter algorithm by using variational inference (VIKF) is proposed. With variational method, the joint posterior distribution of the states is approximately decomposed into several relatively independent posterior distributions. To avoid the difficulty of high-dimensional integrals, these independent posterior distributions are solved by using Kullback-Leibler divergence. The variational inference of Kalman filter includes two steps, the predict step and the update step, and an iterative process is included in the update step to get the optimized solutions of the posterior distribution. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, VIKF is applied to the state estimation of discrete linear state space and the tracking problems in wireless sensor networks. Simulation results show that the variational approximation is effective and reliable for the linear state space, especially for the case with time-varying non-Gaussian noise. © 2013 Zijian Dong and Tiecheng Song.

84891337610	Variational approximation inference for gene regulatory networks from gene perturbations	To improve the inference accuracy of gene regulatory networks (GRN), using both gene perturbations and gene expression data, GRN is modeled as a structural equation model (SEM), and further transformed into the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model. The Bayesian approach is used to infer the parameters of the regulatory networks. Instead of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the variational approximation method (VAM) is applied for its lower computation cost, which factorizes the joint posterior distribution of parameters, and obtains the posterior inclusion probability distribution and the posterior distribution of parameters. An importance sampling technique is then applied to obtain the weighted average of the CFA inferred parameters. Simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the CFA model and the variational approximation. Based on the experimental data, the regulatory interactions among a 35 yeast genes network are identified with the proposed VAM algorithm.

84892516735	Optimal decision threshold for soft decision cooperative spectrum sensing	In order to achieve higher spectrum efficiency in cognitive radio (CR) systems, a closed-form expression of the optimal decision threshold for soft decision cooperative spectrum sensing based on the minimum total error probability criterion is derived. With the analytical expression of the optimal decision threshold, the impact of different sensing parameters on the threshold value is studied. Theoretical analyses show that the optimal threshold achieves an efficient trade-off between the missed detection probability and the false alarm probability. Simulation results illustrate that the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the soft combination schemes have a great influence on the optimal threshold value, whereas the number of samples has a weak impact on the optimal threshold value. Furthermore, for the maximal ratio combing (MRC) and the modified deflection coefficient (MDC) schemes, the optimal decision threshold value increases and approaches a corresponding individual limit value while the number of CR users increases. But the number of CR users has a weak influence on the optimal decision threshold for the equal gain combining (EGC) scheme.

84893493491	Inference of gene regulatory networks from genetic perturbations with linear regression model	It is an effective strategy to use both genetic perturbation data and gene expression data to infer regulatory networks that aims to improve the detection accuracy of the regulatory relationships among genes. Based on both types of data, the genetic regulatory networks can be accurately modeled by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). In this paper, a linear regression (LR) model is formulated based on the SEM, and a novel iterative scheme using Bayesian inference is proposed to estimate the parameters of the LR model (LRBI). Comparative evaluations of LRBI with other two algorithms, the Adaptive Lasso (AL-Based) and the Sparsity-aware Maximum Likelihood (SML), are also presented. Simulations show that LRBI has significantly better performance than AL-Based, and overperforms SML in terms of power of detection. Applying the LRBI algorithm to experimental data, we inferred the interactions in a network of 35 yeast genes. An open-source program of the LRBI algorithm is freely available upon request. © 2013 Dong et al.

The optimal linear soft combination framework of cooperative spectrum sensing includes the local spectrum sensing and optimal fusion center. This paper studies the optimal weighted cooperative spectrum sensing. We apply a new LINWPSO algorithm for optimal weight setting to improve the sensing performance. Simulation results and analysis demonstrated that the LINWPSO method has better CROC performance than the MDC and SNR based methods, but this algorithm needs more computation complexity. If the number of particles for particle swarm optimization algorithm is large enough, the performance of LINWPSO method outperforms PSO method. In addition, performance analysis on different signal to noise ratio (SNR) environment is discussed. © 2013 IEEE.

84903220035	Message passing-based OFDMA uplink resource allocation to users with different date rate needs	Different needs on Qos usually result in different date rates for the subscribers in a wireless network. To address the problem of distributed resource allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) uplink, an optimization model is utilized to minimize the transmitted power constrained on exclusive occupation of each subchannel for avoidance of multiuser access interference (MAI) and minimum rate of each user for fairness, to reach a suboptimal solution. Two schemes are compared. The 1st scheme is a traditional one that all subchannels are equally assigned to all users based on message passing (MP) algorithm, afterward dynamic programming (DP)-based bitsloadings are performed. The 2nd scheme is an improved one as follows: each user is given a subchannel-quota firstly, which is configured to be proportional to its individual date rate needed, and based on all these quotas MP algorithm is executed, and the final course is the same. Theoretical analysis and simulation verification indicate that the 2nd scheme outperforms the 1st one significantly on the transmitted power consumption, and their iteration times are very close. © 2014 WIT Press.

84903639482	Protocol design and capacity analysis in hybrid network of visible light communication and OFDMA systems	Visible light communication (VLC) uses a vast unregulated and free light spectrum. It is considered to be a solution for overcoming the crowded radio spectrum for wireless communication systems. However, duplex communication, user mobility, and handover mechanisms are becoming challenging tasks in a VLC system. This paper proposes a hybrid network model of VLC and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing access (OFDMA) in which the VLC channel is only used for downlink transmission, whereas OFDMA channels are served for uplinks in any situation or for downlinks only without VLC hotspots coverage. A novel protocol is proposed combined with access, horizontal, and vertical handovermechanisms formobile terminal (MT) to resolve user mobility among different hotspots and OFDMA system. A new VLC network scheme and its frame format are presented to deal with the multiuser access problems in every hotspot. In addition, a new metric ρ is defined to evaluate the capacity of this hybrid network as the spatial density of interarrival time of MT requests in s

84906997984	Optimal spectrum access strategy for multi-channel cognitive radio networks with Nakagami fading and finite-size buffer	The opportunistic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks has always played a key role in improving the performance of secondary users. In this paper, we propose an optimal spectrum access strategy for multi-channel access of secondary users under multiple physical considerations. Firstly we integrate path loss and Nakagami-m fading of primary and secondary links with imperfect spectrum sensing into our model to obtain the probability that data packet is successfully transmitted. Then we introduce the M/M/1/K queueing to deduce the average packet delay under the assumption of finite-size buffer. In order to minimize the total average packet delay, the optimal probability vector for spectrum access is confirmed by genetic algorithm. Result proves that our proposed spectrum access strategy outperforms the strategies of equal probability and inverse ratio. Furthermore, according to the optimal probability vector, the total average packet loss rate is derived with one more consideration that the number of transmission attempts for automatic repeat request is fixed. Finally, numerical results illustrate the effects of referred lower-layer parameters on total average packet delay and loss rate. © 2014 IEEE.

0346998338	Interference analysis and improvement of capacity reduction for FHSS networks in WPAN application environment	The coexistence between Bluetooth system and IEEE 802.11 frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) equipment is analyzed. Based on the capacity formulae and system simulation, the inter-affection between these networks is compared. A fragment adaptive solution of packet payload length is presented, which can be used to improve the capacity reduction of IEEE 802.11 FHSS network. Analysis results show that the IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard with its inherent mechanism supports this fragment length adaptive algorithm. With the increase of Bluetooth interfering networks, this adaptive solution can effectively relieve capacity decreasing of IEEE 802.11 FHSS network. The capacity analysis method and adaptive algorithm can also be generalized into other FHSS networks.

13444310580	Novel method of enhancing the key amount for FH systems	Based on the principle of information theory, a novel scheme of unequal-interval frequency-hopping (FH) systems was proposed. For cases of spectrum overlapping systems and non-overlapping systems, the implementation methods were presented and the security performances were discussed theoretically. Firstly, the definitions of absolute and relative key amounts of FH systems, equal-interval and unequal-interval FH systems were given. Then, the absolute key amount and relative key amount were analyzed for equal-interval and unequal-interval FH systems. The results indicated that the absolute key amount had become the key point in improving the security and secrecy of FH systems, especially in today's epoch of highly developed computer science and IC design technology. Theoretical analysis and practical examples showed that the absolute key amount of unequal-interval FH systems was generally over two orders larger than that of equal-interval ones when spectrum overlapping was allowable. Therefore, there was great superiority in enhancing the security and secrecy for the scheme mentioned.
