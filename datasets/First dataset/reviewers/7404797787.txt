14244268279	Regulation of ectoplasmic specialization dynamics in the seminiferous epithelium by focal adhesion-associated proteins in testosterone-suppressed rat testes	Apical ectoplasmic specialization (ES) is a unique testis-specific cell-cell actin-based adherens junction type restricted to the Sertoli-round/elongating/elongate spermatid interface in the seminiferous epithelium. An endogenous testosterone (T) suppression model was used to study the regulation of apical ES dynamics in the testis. By providing sustained releases of T and estradiol using subdermal implants in rats, this treatment reduced endogenous testicular T level. This in turn led to sloughing of spermatids (step 8 and beyond) from the seminiferous epithelium, which can be reversed by removing the implants, or replacing them with a higher dose of T implants. This model thus allows us to study the restructuring events at the apical ES. It was shown that apical ES restructuring involved proteins that were usually restricted to the cell-matrix focal adhesion site in other epithelia. For instance, the protein levels of β1-integrin, Tyr-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK), and c-Src were induced during the T suppression-induced germ cell loss and recovery, implicating that these proteins are putative regulators of ES dynamics. Indeed, the formation of p-FAK/c-Src protein complex, but not their association with β1-integrin, was stimulated during T suppression-induced germ cell loss. ERK, a MAPK known to regulate focal adhesion turnover, was also activated during the androgen suppression-induced spermatid loss and the early phase of the recovery when germ cells began to repopulate the epithelium. Collectively, these data suggest that the apical ES is a cell-cell adherens junction type with the characteristics of cell-matrix focal contacts. In addition to its role in conferring cell adhesion formation, the p-FAK/c-Src protein complex apparently also regulates apical ES disruption via the ERK signaling pathway.

14244270095	Regulation of sertoli-germ cell adherens junction dynamics via changes in protein-protein interactions of the N-cadherin-β-catenin protein complex which are possibly mediated by c-Src and myotubularin-related protein 2: An in vivo study using an androgen suppression model	Using a well characterized model of cell-cell actin-based adherens junction (AJ) disruption by suppressing the intratesticular testosterone level in adult rats with testosterone-estradiol implants, we have confirmed earlier findings that Sertoli-germ cell AJ dynamics are regulated by the activation of kinases via putative signaling pathways but with some unexpected findings as follows. First, the loss of germ cells from the seminiferous epithelium during androgen suppression was associated with a surge in myotubularin-related protein 2 (MTMR2, a lipid phosphatase, in which adult MTMH2

16244387361	Role of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in ex vivo expansion of human limbal epithelial cells cultured on human amniotic membrane	PURPOSE. To investigate the expression and pivotal role of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in the ex vivo expansion of human limbal explants with or without amniotic membrane (AM). METHODS. Corneoscleral buttons were cultured on intact, denuded AM or plastic dishes for 3 weeks. To determine the role of MMP-9 in cell migration, either the MMP inhibitor GM6001 or an MMP-9 antibody was used. Expression of MMP-9 was determined by gelatin zymography, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS. The expression of MMP-9 in all culture conditions increased in a time-dependent manner. However, the active form of MMP-9 emerged only in cultures on both intact and denuded AM from the second week. The averaged corrected ratio of MMP-9 expression in cultures on intact AM versus those on denuded AM or plastic dishes was 2.76 ± 0.69- or 4.25 ± 0.30-fold, respectively, when total RNA was used as an internal control. MMP-9 transcripts were upregulated in cultures on intact AM compared with the other two culture conditions. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the MMP-9 protein was located on the limbal epithelial cells. Upregulation of MMP-9 associated with cell migration was significantly attenuated by both GM6001 and MMP-9 antibody, consistent with the inhibition of MMP-9 activity, as determined by gelatin zymography. In contrast, the sizes of limbal outgrowth were not different between the control and MMP-9 antibody-treated plastic dishes. CONCLUSIONS. These results demonstrated that MMP-9 not only was upregulated, it was also involved in the outgrowth of limbal epithelial cells. These results suggest that cell-cell matrix interaction is involved in the expansion of limbal epithelial cells on intact AM, and MMP-9 may be a key element.

14644429079	An integral approach for hydromagnetic natural convection heat and mass transfer from vertical surfaces with power-law variation in wall temperature and concentration in porous media	This work uses the integral method to study the heat and mass transfer by natural convection from vertical plates with variable wall temperature and concentration in porous media saturated with an electrically conducting fluid in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. The surface temperature and concentration are assumed to vary as a power of the axial coordinate measured from the leading edge of the plate. The approximate solutions are found to be in reasonable agreement with the similarity solutions. Results are plotted for the local Nusselt number, the local Sherwood number, and the reciprocal of the ratio of the thermal boundary-layer thickness to the concentration boundary-layer thickness. Increasing the power-law exponents tends to increase the local Nusselt number and the local Sherwood number. Increasing the magnetic parameter decreases the local Nusselt number and the local Sherwood number. Moreover, the ratio of the thermal boundary-layer thickness to the concentration boundary-layer thickness increases with the Lewis number, and it also increases with the buoyancy ratio when the Lewis number is not equal to one. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

17644401661	Metastatic pulmonary calcification in renal failure mimicking pulmonary embolism on lung scan	Metastatic pulmonary calcification (MPC) characterized by diffuse calcium deposition in the lungs is known to occur in patients with chronic renal failure. However, MPC with pulmonary artery calcification is uncommon and has only been detected in a few patients with severe disorders. A 48-year-old man with chronic renal failure had cough and progressive dyspnea. Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) lung scans showed multiple large-sized mismatched V/Q defects in the left middle and lower zones of lungs, which was consistent with a high probability of pulmonary embolism (PE). The findings of pulmonary scintigraphy resulted from MPC with pulmonary artery calcification, revealed by simultaneous technetium-99m MDP scintigraphy, low-dose computed tomography, and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest.

1942498744	The optimum allocation of heat transfer equipment for an irreversible combined heat engine with ecological criteria	Finite-time thermodynamics with an ecological criterion is used to optimize the performance of an irreversible combined Carnot heat-engine. The irreversiblities come from two sources: (1) finite heat conductance for the three heat exchangers; (2) irreversibility inside the heat engine. The ecological function is defined as the power output minus the loss power or the product of the environmental temperature and the entropy rate. The ecological function is optimized with respect to two dimensionless cycle temperatures and thermal efficiency. The maximum ecological function and its corresponding power output and thermal efficiency are presented. It is shown that the ecological function is an important criterion for the design of an irreversible combined Carnot heat engine, considering not only the power output but also the thermal efficiency. When the three heat exchangers have equal heat transfer coefficients, the optimum heat-transfer area ratio for the middle heat exchanger is always equal to 1/3, independent of the irreversibility parameters for the top and bottom cycles and the heat reservoir temperature ratio. Furthermore, the optimum heat-transfer area ratio for the hot-end heat exchanger decreases while that for the cold-end heat exchanger increases as the irreversibility parameters of the top and bottom cycles are increased. © 2004 Elsevier Science Ltd.

18844436448	Disruption of Sertoli-germ cell adhesion function in the seminiferous epithelium of the rat testis can be limited to adherens junctions without affecting the blood-testis barrier integrity: An in vivo study using an androgen suppression model	During spermatogenesis, both adherens junctions (AJ) (such as ectoplasmic specialization (ES), a testis-specific AJ type at the Sertoli cell-spermatid interface (apical ES) or Sertoli-Sertoli cell interface (basal ES) in the apical compartment and BTB, respectively) and tight junctions (TJ) undergo extensive restructuring to permit germ cells to move across the blood-testis barrier (BTB) as well as the seminiferous epithelium from the basal compartment to the luminal edge to permit fully developed spermatids (spermatozoa) to be sloughed at spermiation. However, the integrity of the BTB cannot be compromised throughout spermatogenesis so that postmeiotic germ cell-specific antigens can be sequestered from the systemic circulation at all times. We thus hypothesize that AJ disruption in the seminiferous epithelium unlike other epithelia, can occur without compromising the BTB-barrier, even though these junctions, namely TJ and basal ES, co-exist side-by-side in the BTB. Using an intratesticular androgen suppression-induced germ cell loss model, we have shown that the disruption of AJs indeed was limited to the Sertoli-germ cell interface without perturbing the BTB. The testis apparently is using a unique physiological mechanism to induce the production of both TJ- and AJ-integral membrane proteins and their associated adaptors to maintain BTB integrity yet permitting a transient loss of cell adhesion function by dissociating N-cadherin from β-catenin at the apical and basal ES. The enhanced production of TJ proteins, such as occludin and ZO-1, at the BTB site can supersede the transient loss of cadherin-catenin function at the basal ES. This thus allows germ cell depletion from the epithelium without compromising BTB integrity. It is plausible that the testis is using this novel mechanism to facilitate the movement of preleptotene and leptotene spermatocytes across the BTB at late stage VIII through early stage IX of the epithelial cycle in the rat while maintaining the BTB immunological barrier function. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Tc-99m MDP whole-body bone imaging was performed on a 38-year-old woman for clinical staging of breast cancer. The bone scintigraphy demonstrated no skeletal abnormality. However, extensive accumulation of radioactivity in the colon was noted. This resulted from the patient drinking her own urine, because some people believe that it is a way to improve their health. To avoid such misleading conditions, thorough history taking, including administration of traditional remedies, special habits, and the habitat of the patient, are necessary before imaging.

21644457437	Sertoli-germ cell anchoring junction dynamics in the testis are regulated by an interplay of lipid and protein kinases	When Sertoli and germ cells were co-cultured in vitro in serum-free chemically defined medium, functional anchoring junctions such as cell-cell intermediate filament-based desmosome-like junctions and cell-cell actin-based adherens junctions (e.g. ectoplasmic specialization (ES)) were formed within 1-2 days. This event was marked by the induction of several protein kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated protein kinase B (PKB; also known as Akt), p21-activated kinase-2 (PAK-2), and their downstream effector (ERK) as well as an increase in PKB intrinsic activity. PI3K, phospho (p)-PKB, and PAK were co-localized to the site of apical ES in the seminiferous epithelium of the rat testis in immunohistochemistry studies. Furthermore, PI3K also co-localized with p-PKB to the same site in the epithelium as determined by fluorescence microscopy, consistent with their localization at the ES. These kinases were shown to associate with ES-associated proteins such as β1-integrin, phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase, and c-Src by co-immunoprecipitation, suggesting that the integrin-laminin protein complex at the apical ES likely utilizes these protein kinases as regulatory proteins to modulate Sertoli-germ cell adherens junction dynamics via the ERK signaling pathway. To validate this hypothesis further, an in vivo model using AF-2364 (1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carbohydrazide) to perturb Sertoli-germ cell anchoring junction function, inducing germ cell loss from the epithelium in adult rats, was used in conjunction with specific inhibitors. Interestingly, the event of germ cell loss induced by AF-2364 in vivo was also associated with induction of PI3K, p-PKB, PAK-2, and p-ERK as well as a surge in intrinsic PKB activity. Perhaps the most important of all, pretreatment of rats with wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor) or anti-β1-integrin antibody via intratesticular injection indeed delayed AF-2364-induced spermatid loss from the epithelium. In summary, these results illustrate that Sertoli-germ cell anchoring junction dynamics in the testis are regulated, at least in part, via the β1-integrin/PI3K/PKB/ERK signaling pathway. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

0000134385	Efficiency optimizations of an irreversible brayton heat engine	A steady-flow approach for finite-time thermodynamics is used to calculate the maximum thermal efficiency, its corresponding power output, adiabatic temperature ratio, and thermal-conductance ratio of heat transfer equipment of a closed Brayton heat engine. The physical model considers three types of irreversibilities: finite thermal conductance benveen the working fluid and the reservoirs, heat leaks between the reservoirs, and internal irreversibility inside the closed Brayton heat engine. The effects of heat leaks, hot-cold reservoir temperature ratios, turbine and compressor isentropic efficiencies, and total conductances of heat exchangers on the maximum thermal efficiency and its corresponding parameters are studied. The optimum conductance ratio could be found to effectively use the heat transfer equipment, and this ratio is increased as the component efficiencies and total conductances of heat exchangers are increased, and always less than or equal to 0.5.

Results show that the harmonic curves for the local skin friction coefficient and the local Nu have the same frequency as the frequency of the wavy surface. Moreover, the vortex viscosity parameter tends to decrease the heat transfer rate and to increase the skin friction coefficient.

Calculated results reveal that the N-shaped NDR is due to the resonant tunneling through a quasibound state inside the V-shaped quantum well generated by the 6-doped layer. The peak doping concentration of the δ-doped layer in the barrier region plays a crucial role in determining both the onset and the peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) of the NDR.

0031732607	Rat testicular N-cadherin: Its complementary deoxyribonucleic acid cloning and regulation	Using primer sets specific for mouse N-cadherin and rat testicular RNA for RT-PCR, a full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) coding for rat testicular N-cadherin was isolated. The deduced amino acid sequence of rat N-cadherin yielded a 883-amino acid polypeptide that displayed a 98.6% identity with the mouse homolog. N-Cadherin was found to be expressed by Sertoli and germ cells in the rat testis by RT-PCR. Using Sertoli-germ cell cocultures, it was found that the N-cadherin expression increased with time in culture. To assess whether this is due to a soluble factor(s) released from germ cells that affects Sertoli cell N-cadherin expression, germ cell-conditioned media (GCCM) were fractionated by preparative anion-exchange HPLC, and the resulting fractions were divided into 14 pools. Pool 4 was found to contain a factor(s) that induced a dose-dependent stimulation on Sertoli cell N- cadherin expression with a maximal stimulation at 2 μg protein/dish/4.5 x 10

0031394952	Differential expression of multiple cathepsin mRNAs in the rat testis during maturation and following lonidamine induced tissue restructuring	In the seminiferous epithelium, germ cell development behind the blood-testis barrier involves continual degradation and renewal of inter-testicular cell junctions. This allows: (i) the translocation of developing germ cells from the basal lamina to the adluminal compartment during spermatogenesis, and (ii) the eventual release of mature spermatids into the tubular lumen during spermiation. Throughout spermatogenesis, cellular debris must also be removed from the epithelium. Thus, it is conceivable that proteases, protease inhibitors, and cell junctional components are involved in these events. The present study sought to examine whether testicular cells can express multiple cathepsin mRNAs given that these proteases are involved in the degradation and processing of proteins as well as in tissue regeneration. By using total RNA isolated from primary cultures of Sertoli, Leydig, and germ cells for reverse-transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the mRNAs of cathepsin B, C, D, H, L, and S were shown to be expressed by Sertoli and Leydig cells, whereas germ cells isolated from adult rats expressed all of the above cathepsin mRNAs except cathepsin D. Throughout postnatal development and maturation, the testicular steady-state mRNA levels of cathepsin B, C, D, L, and S remain relatively unchanged with the exception of cathepsin H whose mRNA level increased during maturation and peaked at 45-60 days of age. Using lonidamine, an anti-spermatogenic drug which is known to induce premature release of germ cells without affecting Leydig cell function by disrupting the inter-Sertoli-germ cell junctions, we have examined the differential expression of these cathepsin mRNAs in the testis at the time of extensive tissue restructuring. It was noted that the expression of cathepsin L and S in the testis increased significantly concomitant with the disappearance of elongate spermatids whereas the expression of cathepsin B, C, D, and H increased significantly when most of the round spermatids and spermatocytes were depleted. These results illustrate the intricate inter-relationship between these proteases in the testis during maturation and tissue restructuring.

This study sought to examine the biochemical changes that are involved when germ cells are cocultured with Sertoli cells in vitro preceding the establishment of specialized Sertoli- germ cell junctions. While isolated germ cells were allowed to attach to Sertoli cells, media from both the apical and basal compartments of bicameral units were collected to assess serine and cysteine protease activity.

The effects of heat leaks, hot-to-cold reservoir temperature ratios, and component efficiencies on the maximum power output and the corresponding thermal efficiency are studied. With component efficiencies less than 100%, the optimum ratio of the hot-end heat exchanger conductance to the total conductance of the two heat exchangers is found to be less than 0.5. Moreover, this ratio increases as the component efficiencies and the total conductance of the two heat exchangers are increased, and decreases as the hot-to-cold reservoir temperature ratio is increased.

The optimum values of cycle temperature ratios and conductance ratios of irreversible Carnot heat engines are presented. Moreover, from the viewpoint of the ecological function, the thermal capacitance of the cold external fluid should be larger than that of the hot external fluid and the heat conductance of the hot-end heat exchanger should be smaller than that of the cold-end heat exchanger.

The ratio of ecologically optimum power to maximum power is independent of the numbers of transfer units of the hot-side and the cold-side heat exchangers, and this ratio is much higher than the ratio of the entropy generation rate at maximum ecological function to that at maximum power. With the introduction of the ecological function, the improvement in second-law efficiency and in thermal efficiency is evident, especially for low hot-cold temperature ratios. Moreover, the thermal efficiency at maximum ecological function is about the average of the maximum-power efficiency and the reversible Carnot efficiency. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0032407875	Evidence for cross-talk between sertoli and germ cells using selected cathepsins as markers	To examine whether proteases are possibly involved in cellular migration and/or spermiation when developing germ cells translocate across the seminiferous epithelium during spermatogenesis, in situ hybridization was used to localize messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts of cathepsin L, D, and S in the epithelium at different stages of the spermatogenic cycle in the rat. Cathepsin L mRNA was found to localize almost exclusively near the basal lamina of the epithelium. At stages VI and VII of the cycle before spermiation, the signal of cathepsin L mRNA was so intense that it formed a complete dark precipitate near the basal lamina encircling the entire tubule. At stage VIII, the expression of cathepsin L was completely abolished, and no staining of cathepsin L mRNA was seen in the epithelium. The mRNA of cathepsin D and S was found near the basal lamina, a finding consistent with their localization in Sertoli cells and possibly primary spermatocytes in almost all stages, but peaked at stages VII-IX and VII-VIII of the cycle, respectively, at the time before and during spermiation. These results illustrate the possible involvement of these proteases in facilitating germ cell movement and spermiation. To examine whether germ cells express any of these cathepsin genes, spermatocytes with a purity of greater than 95% were isolated from 15-day-old rat testes by Percoll gradient centrifugation for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. It was found that primary spermatocytes expressed multiple cathepsin genes, including cathepsin B, C, D, H, L, and S. Furthermore, the expression of cathepsin L by germ cells isolated from 15-day-old rats (largely spermatocytes and spermatogonia) can be stimulated by Sertoli cell-enriched culture medium in a dose-dependent manner, but not by germ cell-conditioned medium. These results reveal that germ cell function can be regulated by Sertoli cells. Moreover, these results suggest that germ cells may play an active role in the overall testicular protease expression. Also, we present evidence suggesting there is cross- talk between Sertoli and germ cells, since the expression of cathepsin L in each cell type is regulated by one another via either soluble factors or cell-cell contact.

0032516869	Testin secreted by sertoli cells is associated with the cell surface, and its expression correlates with the disruption of Sertoli-germ cell junctions but not the inter-Sertoli tight junction	Testin is a testosterone-responsive Sertoli cell secretory product. In the present study, we demonstrated that the amount of testin secreted by Sertoli cells in vitro was comparable with several other Sertoli cell secretory products. However, virtually no testin was found in the luminal fluid and cytosols of the testis and epididymis when the intercellular junctions were not previously disrupted, suggesting that secreted testin may be reabsorbed by testicular cells in vivo. Studies using Sertoli cells with and without a cell surface cross-linker and radioiodination in conjunction with immunoprecipitation illustrated the presence of two polypeptides of 28 and 45 kDa, which constitute a binding protein complex that anchors testin onto the cell surface. The 28- and 45-kDa peptide appear to be residing on and inside the cell surface, respectively. Immunogold EM studies illustrated testin was abundantly localized on the Sertoli cell side of the ectoplasmic specialization (a modified adherens junction) surrounding developing spermatids. In contrast, very few testin gold particles were found at the site of inter-Sertoli tight junctions. When the inter-Sertoli tight junctions were formed or disrupted, no significant change in testin expression was noted. This is in sharp contrast to the disruption of Sertoli-germ cell junctions, which is accompanied by a surge in testin expression. These results demonstrate the usefulness of testin in examining Sertoli-germ cell interactions.

23944452834	Nuclear medicine in the evaluation of differentiated thyroid carcinoma: A clinical review	Nuclear medicine has had a great impact on the management of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) over the past decades. Based on the increasing availability of newly developed radiopharmaceuticals and imaging modalities, progress in molecular pathology, improvement of medical care in patients with DTC and understanding of radiation biology in DTC, its applications in dealing with DTC has seen much improvement. More and more radio-labeled ligands have proved to be useful in the detection and treatment of patients with DTC. Except for traditional radiopharmaceuticals such as radioiodine, thallium-201, and Tc-99m MIBI, the usefulness of FDG PET/CT has been recognized in the detection of recurrence or metastases of less or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer. Peptide receptor radiotherapy is thought to have potential in the diagnosis and therapy of non-radioiodine uptake DTC. Laboratory examinations, including serum thyroglobulin measurement and stimulated thyrotropin status, are still the most important and first line test in detecting residual, recurrence, or metastasis of DTC. Nuclear medicine will continue to play a major role in the management of DTC. Copyright © 2005 JMS.

This technology requires automated tools which integrate the overall processing sequence: coating, baking, developing, wet etching, stripping and cleaning. These tools should also enable clustering with e-beam writers and dry etchers for seamless processing.

23844545574	Regulation of sertoli-germ cell adherens junction dynamics in the testis via the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)/cGMP/protein kinase G (PRKG)/β-catenin (CATNB) signaling pathway: An in vitro and in vivo study	During spermatogenesis, extensive restructuring of cell junctions takes place in the seminiferous epithelium to facilitate germ cell movement. However, the mechanism that regulates this event remains largely unknown. Recent studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) likely regulates tight junction (TJ) dynamics in the testis via the cGMP/protein kinase G (cGMP-dependent protein kinase, PRKG) signaling pathway. Due to the proximity of TJ and adherens junctions (AJ) in the testis, in particular at the blood-testis barrier, it is of interest to investigate if NO can affect AJ dynamics. Studies using Sertoli-germ cell cocultures in vitro have shown that the levels of NOS (nitric oxide synthase), cGMP, and PRKG were induced when anchoring junctions were being established. Using an in vivo model in which adult rats were treated with adjudin [a molecule that induces adherens junction disruption, formerly called AF-2364, 1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-IH-indazole-3-carbohydrazide], the event of AJ disruption was also associated with a transient iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase, NOS2) induction. Immunohistochemistry has illustrated that NOS2 was intensely accumulated in Sertoli and germ cells in the epithelium during adjudin-induced germ cell loss, with a concomitant accumulation of intracellular cGMP and an induction of PRKG but not cAMP or protein kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PRKA). To identify the NOS-mediated downstream signaling partners, coimmunoprecipitation was used to demonstrate that NOS2 and eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase, NOS3) were structurally associated with the N-cadherin (CDH2)/β-catenin (CATNB)/actin complex but not the nectin-3 (poliovirus receptor-related 3, PVRL 3)/afadin (myeloid/lymphoid or mixed lineage-leukemia tranlocation to 4 homolog, MLLT4) nor the integrin β1 (ITβ1)-mediated protein complexes, illustrating the spatial vicinity of NOS with selected AJ-protein complexes. Interestingly, CDH2 and CATNB were shown to dissociate from NOS during the adjudin-mediated AJ disruption, implicating the CDH2/CATNB protein complex is the likely downstream target of the NO signaling. Furthermore, PRKG, the downstream signaling protein of NOS, was shown to interact with CATNB in the rat testis. Perhaps the most important of all, pretreatment of testes with KT5823, a specific PRKG inhibitor, can indeed delay the adjudin-induced germ cell loss, further validating NOS/NO regulates Sertoli-germ cell AJ dynamics via the cGMP/PRKG pathway. These results illustrate that the CDH2/CATNB-mediated adhesion function in the testis is regulated, at least in part, via the NOS/cGMP/PRKG/CATNB pathway. © 2005 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.

25144479969	Thermal contact conductance of coated surfaces	The thermal contact resistance phenomena are increasingly important as the size of mechanical and electronic components decrease. Applying a coating material with high thermal conductivity is an effective way to enhance the thermal contact conductance. This work conducted an experimental and theoretical study to investigate the effects of diamond film coatings on the thermal contact conductance. A model based on statistical elastoplastic surface contact mechanics was developed to study the thermal contact conductance of coating material. Diamond films were sputtered on the substrate of ceramics by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition. Test samples have different surface roughnesses, deposition times and deposition qualities. A range of test conditions was conducted to evaluate the thermal contact conductance of coated films and for comparisons with the theoretical model. © 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

33645213154	Magnetic field effects on laminar film condensation on a finite-size horizontal wavy disk	This work aims to study the laminar film condensation heat transfer with magnetic field effects on a finite-size horizontal wavy disk. Mathematical analysis is used to obtain the dimensionless governing equations and boundary conditions, and the cubic spline collocation method is then used to calculate the flow and heat transfer characteristics along the wavy disk. The effects of the important parameters, such as Hartmann number, condensation parameter, wave number, amplitude-wavelength ratio, and Pr/Ja on the heat transfer characteristics have been successfully examined. The magnetic field effect increases the critical condensate thickness and thus decreases the condensation heat transfer. Odd wave number effects decrease the critical condensate thickness and thus enhance the condensation heat transfer. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

33645215414	Association of CTLA-4 gene polymorphism with oral squamous cell carcinoma	BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a worldwide problem. The main mechanism of tumor immunity is the destruction of tumor cells by cytolytic T lymphocytes. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4; CD152), a negative regulator of T-lymphocyte activation, plays an extremely important role in the immune tolerance and anergy. This study was designed to investigate the role of CTLA-4 polymorphism in OSCC. METHODS: The CTLA-4 +49 A/G polymorphism was studied in 118 patients with OSCC and 147 healthy controls by using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The genotype and phenotype frequencies were evaluated in Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the frequency of CTLA-4 polymorphism between the OSCC study group and healthy controls. The CTLA-4 A/A genotype was significantly associated with a younger age of onset of OSCC (P = 0.04). The AA genotype was associated with significantly poorer survival (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The present study is the first to shows that the A/A polymorphism is associated with poor survival in OSCC in Taiwan. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2006.

33646255666	Fully developed natural convection heat and mass transfer of a micropolar fluid in a vertical channel with asymmetric wall temperatures and concentrations	This work examines the effects of the vortex viscosity parameter and the buoyancy ratio on the fully developed natural convection heat and mass transfer of a micropolar fluid in a vertical channel with asymmetric wall temperatures and concentrations. The closed-form analytic solutions for the important characteristics of fluid flow, heat transfer, and mass transfer are derived. Increasing the vortex viscosity parameter tends to increase the magnitude of microrotation and thus decreases the fluid velocity in the vertical channel. Moreover, the volume flow rate, the total heat rate added to the fluid, and the total species rate added to the fluid for micropolar fluids are lower than those of Newtonian fluids. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33745238920	Fully developed natural convection heat and mass transfer in a vertical annular porous medium with asymmetric wall temperatures and concentrations	This work examines the effects of the modified Darcy number, the buoyancy ratio and the inner radius-gap ratio on the fully developed natural convection heat and mass transfer in a vertical annular non-Darcy porous medium with asymmetric wall temperatures and concentrations. The exact solutions for the important characteristics of fluid flow, heat transfer, and mass transfer are derived by using a non-Darcy flow model. The modified Darcy number is related to the flow resistance of the porous matrix. For the free convection heat and mass transfer in an annular duct filled with porous media, increasing the modified Darcy number tends to increase the volume flow rate, total heat rate added to the fluid, and the total species rate added to the fluid. Moreover, an increase in the buoyancy ratio or in the inner radius-gap ratio leads to an increase in the volume flow rate, the total heat rate added to the fluid, and the total species rate added to the fluid. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33745333377	Effects of collimator dependency and correction methods on 1-123 SPECT images using X-ray-based attenuation map	Low energy (LE) collimator is generally used in 1-123 SPECT imaging. However, the septal penetration and scattering of photons emitted with energy above 159 keV will affect the image contrast and quantitative accuracy of images. To reduce this effect, medium energy (ME) collimator has been used with the cost of lower counting statistics and spatial resolution. The effects of collimator dependency on the quantitative accuracy of attenuation corrected (AC) 1-123 SPECT images using X-ray-based attenuation map was investigated. Both brain and heart/thorax phantoms were used to evaluate different degree of attenuation effect between brain and thorax. Experiments were performed at different target-to-background ratios to simulate different object contrast. Both photopeak and scatter projections were collected for dual-energy window scatter correction (SC). Images were reconstructed and compared using different reconstruction methods, which included FBP (filtered backprojection), and OSEM (ordered subset expectation maximization) without corrections, with AC, with SC, and with AC and SC. In both phantom studies, the image contrast and quantitative accuracy were both improved with the use of CT-based transmission map for AC. The image contrast provided by ME collimator was better than that of LE collimator, especially in the region with void activity of thorax phantom. From the results of phantom studies, medium energy collimator with CT-based transmission map showed improvements in image contrast and quantitative accuracy of 1-123 SPECT images.

33747881517	Tumor necrosis factor α reversibly disrupts the blood-testis barrier and impairs Sertoli-germ cell adhesion in the seminiferous epithelium of adult rat testes	The timely restructuring of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) that facilitates the migration of preleptotene and leptotene spermatocytes from the basal to the adluminal compartment in the seminiferous epithelium of adult rat testes, which occurs at late stage VII through early stage VIII of the epithelial cycle, is a crucial cellular event of spermatogenesis. However, the regulation of BTB dynamics at the biochemical level remains elusive. In this study, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), a secretory product of Sertoh and germ cells in rat testes, was shown to affect junction dynamics in vivo. Following an acute administration of recombinant TNFα directly to adult rat testes in vivo at 0·5 and 2 μg/testis (with a body weight ∼300 g), this treatment significantly and transiently disrupted the BTB. It also transiently inhibited the steady-state protein levels of occludin, zonula occludens-1, and N-cadherin, but not junction adhesion molecule-A, α-, and β-catenin in testes at the BTB site as illustrated by immunoblottings, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and fluorescent microscopy. This transient disruption of the BTB integrity induced by TNFα treatment was further demonstrated by a functional test to assess the passage of a fluorescent dye (e.g. fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate) from the systemic circulation to the adluminal compartment. Additionally, both the phosphorylated-Ser/Thr protein kinase activated by MAP kinase kinase (p-p38) and phosphorylated-externally regulated kinase (p-ERK) mitogen -activated protein kinase-signaling pathways were transiently activated. Collectively, these data coupled with the recently published in vitro studies have illustrated that the BTB is likely utilizing a novel mechanism in which localized production of TNFα by Sertoli and germ cells into the microenvironment at the basal compartment facilitates the timely restructuring ('opening'?) of the BTB during spermatogenesis to facilitate germ cell migration. © 2006 Society for Endocrinology.

33748186963	Dual-time-point PET/CT to differentiate fluorodeoxyglucose-avid hiatal hernia from mediastinal malignancy	It has been reported that a hiatal hernia may accumulate F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and such a focal F-18 FDG activity detected in the middle-posterior mediastinum usually raises the unnecessary suspicion of malignancy. The F-18 FDG uptake might be the result of physiological gastric activity or an inflammatory process associated with gastroesophageal reflux in a hiatal hernia patient. For the suspected esophageal hiatal lesion, diminished F-18 FDG activity on delayed imaging and identification of gastrointestinal loops by coregistered computed tomography could assist with the diagnosis of a hiatal hernia. We describe a case of hiatal hernia featuring a paraesophageal mass with disappearing F-18 FDG avidity in the middle-posterior mediastinum during a PET scan for cancer workup.

33748936348	Association study of polymorphisms in glycine transporter with schizophrenia	Glycine acts as an obligatory co-agonist with glutamate on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Brain glycine availability is determined by glycine transporters (GlyT1 or SLC6A9), which mediate glycine reuptake into nerve terminals. Since hypofunction of NMDA receptors has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, this study tests the hypothesis that GlyT1 genetic variants confer susceptibility to schizophrenia. Four GlyT1 polymorphisms were studied in a sample population of 249 people with schizophrenia and 210 normal controls. One polymorphism (rs16831541) was not informative in our Chinese population while the other three polymorphisms (rs1766967, rs2248632 and rs2248253) were analysed with chi-square tests and haplotype analysis. Significant linkage disequilibrium was obtained among the three polymorphisms. Neither single marker nor haplotype analysis revealed an association between variants at the GlyT1 locus and schizophrenia, suggesting that it is unlikely that the GlyT1 polymorphisms investigated play a substantial role in conferring susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Chinese population. Further studies with other GlyT1 variants, relating either to schizophrenia, psychotic symptoms or to therapeutic response in schizophrenia, are suggested. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

33749001717	Nonsimilar solutions for natural convection heat and mass transfer near a permeable horizontal cylinder of elliptic cross section in porous media	A nonsimilar boundary layer analysis is presented for natural convection heat and mass transfer near a permeable horizontal cylinder of elliptic cross section with constant wall temperature and concentration in fluid-saturated porous media. The governing equations are first transformed into a dimensionless form by a suitable coordinate transformation. The transformed nonsimilar governing equations are then solved by the cubic spline collocation method. Numerical results for the heat and mass transfer characteristics are presented as functions of the transpiration parameter, the Lewis number, the buoyancy ratio, and the aspect ratio when the major axis of the elliptic cylinder is vertical (slender orientation) and horizontal (blunt orientation). Results show that an increase in the transpiration parameter tends to decrease the boundary layer thickness and thus increases the heat and mass transfer rates between the fluid and the wall. Moreover, the heat and mass transfer rates of the cylinder with blunt orientation are lower than those of the cylinder with slender orientation.

33749171425	Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) prevents apoptosis in ex vivo expansion of human limbal epithelial cells cultivated on human amniotic membrane	Stem cells of the corneal epithelium have been found to be located exclusively at the anatomical junction between the cornea and the conjunctiva, the limbus. Ex vivo expanded limbal epithelial cells on amniotic membrane (AM) are capable of restoring the corneal surface with limbal stem cell deficiency. Recent studies indicate that intact AM preserves the limbal epithelial phenotype and that distinct epithelial morphology is noted among various culture matrix. However, the factors in response to the interaction between limbal epithelial cells and AM were not well understood. Using Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining, we found that human limbal epithelial cells expanded on intact human AM demonstrated fewer apoptotic cells as compared with those on plastic dishes. To identify the anti-apoptotic factors, we performed cDNA microarray analysis and showed that interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) was overexpressed in cultures on intact AM, which was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we also noted that the phenomenon of apoptosis detected in cultures on plastic dishes could be reversed by adding recombinant IL-1RA protein into the media, whereas apoptosis of limbal epithelial cells cultivated on intact AM could be induced by exogenous neutralizing IL-1RA neutralizing antibody. These results demonstrated that intact human AM may prevent cultured human limbal epithelial cells from undergoing apoptosis. IL-1RA might be a candidate mediator to exert as an anti-apoptotic molecule during the interaction between human limbal epithelial cells and intact human AM. ©AlphaMed Press.

33749265340	Natural convection heat and mass transfer of non-Newtonian power law fluids with yield stress in porous media from a vertical plate with variable wall heat and mass fluxes	This work studies the heat and mass transfer by natural convection from a vertical plate with variable wall heat and mass fluxes in a porous medium saturated with a non-Newtonian power law fluid with yield stress for the general case of power law variations in wall heat and mass fluxes. The governing equations are transformed into a dimensionless form by the similarity transformation and then solved by a cubic spline collocation method. Results are presented for velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles, as well as the Nusselt and Sherwood numbers for various parameters of the power law fluid with yield stress in porous media. The existence of threshold pressure gradient in the power law fluids tends to decrease the fluid velocity and the local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers. An increase in the power law exponent increases the local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33750012588	Phytotoxicity data safeguard the performance of the recipient plants in leachate irrigation	Leachates from an operating and a closed landfill were examined for their phytotoxicity by seed germination/root elongation tests using seeds of Brassica chinensis and Lolium perenne. Their EC50s ranged from 3% to 46% v/v, which varied remarkably with the operating status of the landfills. Seedlings of twelve tree species were grown in pots, which were irrigated with landfill leachate at the EC50 levels, with tap water as control. No tree mortality or growth inhibition was observed after 90 days of leachate application. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurement also showed that plants receiving leachate did not suffer from a decline in photosynthetic efficiency. Litsea glutinosa and Hibiscus tiliaceus had remarkable growth, and other non-N-fixers were not inferior to the N-fixing Acacia auriculiformis. Leachate irrigation improved soil N content, though P deficiency is still a problem. The seed bioassay provided a conservative estimate of the phytotoxicity of landfill leachate. Plants irrigated can be protected from growth inhibition when the leachate irrigation plan is designed with reference to phytotoxicity data. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33845392270	NaTaO3 photocatalysts of different crystalline structures for water splitting into H2 and O2	Perovskite-type NaTa O3 derived from a sol-gel synthesis exhibited a larger surface area and a remarkably higher photocatalytic activity in water splitting than the solid-state synthesized NaTa O3. The sol-gel and solid-state NaTa O3 had different crystalline structures of monoclinic P2m and orthorhombic Pcmn, respectively. Diffuse reflectance spectra showed that the sol-gel specimen had a slightly larger band gap. The band structure analysis revealed an indirect band gap for the sol-gel NaTa O3, contrary to the direct band gap of the solid-state one. The difference in the electronic structure and surface area explained the higher photocatalytic activity of the sol-gel NaTa O3. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.

33751323684	Product information sharing in collaborative product development with Web-based 3D visualization	This paper presents new applications of the Web-based 3D visualization technology in collaborative product development. Three software prototypes are developed with the technology for non-designer to interact with product model without the need of CAD tools. The first system allows the end customer to configure individual components of 3D assembly with a regular Web browser. It provides a simple approach to collecting the customer's voices. Next, an integration framework is implemented that enables synchronous communications between CAD and on the shelf software tool of 3D visualization. Peer-to-peer design collaboration is thus realized. Finally, this research proposes a computation mechanism for online modification of design features based on a STL model. A Web 3D catalog is developed for customization of real industrial parts using the proposed mechanism. The implementation results of these prototypes indicate that Web-based 3D visualization is an effective interfacing technology to facilitate 3D information sharing for most product-centric activities in a simple and cost-effective manner.

33751503969	Non-Darcy natural convection heat and mass transfer from a vertical wavy surface in saturated porous media	This work examines the effects of spatially wavy surface and fluid inertia on the natural convection heat and mass transfer near a vertical wavy surface embedded in a non-Darcy fluid-saturated porous medium. A simple coordinate transformation is employed to transform a wavy surface to a smooth surface, and the obtained boundary layer equations are then solved by the cubic spline collocation method. Results for local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are presented as functions of surface amplitude-wavelength ratio, buoyancy ratio, Lewis number, and modified Grashof number. The modified Grashof number is used for evaluating the relative importance of inertial effects and viscous effects. For the free convection heat and mass transfer near a vertical wavy surface, increasing the modified Grashof number tends to decrease the heat and mass transfer rate, while higher amplitude-wavelength ratio decreases the average Nusselt and Sherwood numbers. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33845214817	The interaction of protein-modified nanodiamond with bacterial cells	The nanometer-sized diamond functionalizing and optimization of this process are studied. To create the functional groups on the nanodiamond surface the carboxylation/oxidization of 100 nm nanodiamonds was applied and its IR spectra were analyzed. The surface functionalizing was followed by conjugating with protein (lysozyme) via physical adsorption. Nanodiamond-protein interaction was analyzed using FTIR spectroscopy. The interaction of lysozyme-nanodiamond conjugates with E. Coli bacteria was observed by analyzing the adsorbed lysozyme antibacterial activity. Nanodiamond-lysozyme conjugates displayed high activity, equivalent to activity of lysozyme in solution. The results demonstrated that the lysozyme preserved its functionality in conjugates with nanodiamond, while in the same time nanodiamonds can serve as probe using spectroscopic methods.

33846026349	Use of intelligent computer search for the patterns of abnormal lymphatic uptake by F-18 FDG PET in primary lung cancers	Objective: To identify patterns of abnormal lymphatic uptake from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by staging FDG PET. Methods: 573 NSCLC patients were analyzed. NSCLC sites were divided into right upper (RU) and lower (RL), left upper (LU) and lower (LL) zones. The lymph nodes were grouped into right pre-tracheal triangle (PT), left aorto-pulmonary window (AP), right (RH) and left (LH) hilum and subcarina (SC). Results: The frequencies of NSCLC from various lung zones to show abnormal lymphatic uptake in various lymph node regions were as below: (1) RU: 19%, double that from other 3 zones (about 10%) in PT; (2) LU: 17%, followed by LL: 14% but rarely from right side (<10%) in AP; (3) RU: 29% and RL: 32% but infrequently from left side (<20%) in RH; (4) LL: 29%, compared to about 10% from other 3 zones in LH; and (5) Lower lung zones: about 20% while upper lung zones: <10% in SC. All 4 zones showed <5% in the bilateral hilar uptake. The frequency of crossover from left side (38%) was greater than that from right side (30%) (p=0.015), with upper lung zones (26%) less frequent than that of lower lung zones (45%) (p<0.0001). The probabilities of NSCLC contributing to the abnormal uptake for a given lymph node region are: (1) PT: 52% from RU; (2) AP: 42% from LU; (3) LH: 36% from LL and 26% from LU; and (4) RH: 31% from RL and 44% from RU. Conclusions: Specific lymphatic uptake patterns are identified for NSCLC from different lung zones, which may assist in accurate staging of lung cancer by PET or CT-PET. Copyright © 2006 JMS.

33846435273	FDG PET/CT demonstrated rapid progression of mediastinal lymphadenopathy in sarcoidosis	Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is usually a sign of serious underlying disease. A patient who had nodular patchy opacity of the right hilum from a routine screening chest radiograph was referred for the whole-body PET/CT scan with FDG. The initial PET/CT scan demonstrated mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a 2-month follow-up PET/CT revealed the progression of lymphadenopathy with several newly developed FDG-avid nodes. Biopsy demonstrated chronic noncaseating granulomatous process, which was consistent with sarcoidosis. This report may suggest the possibility that rapid progression in size and FDG uptake of mediastinal nodes could be sarcoidosis and not malignancy. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

33846586935	Ectoplasmic specialization: A friend or a foe of spermatogenesis?	The ectoplasmic specialization (ES) is a testis-specific, actin-based hybrid anchoring and tight junction. It is confined to the interface between Sertoli cells at the blood-testis barrier, known as the basal ES, as well as between Sertoli cells and developing spermatids designated the apical ES. The ES shares features of adherens junctions, tight junctions and focal contacts. By adopting the best features of each junction type, this hybrid nature of ES facilitates the extensive junction-restructuring events in the seminiferous epithelium during spermatogenesis. For instance, the α6β1-integrin- laminin 333 complex, which is usually limited to the cell-matrix interface in other epithelia to facilitate cell movement, is a putative apical ES constituent. Furthermore, JAM-C and CAR, two tight junction integral membrane proteins, are also components of apical ES involving in spermatid orientation. We discuss herein the mechanisms that maintain the cross-talk between ES and blood-testis barrier to facilitate cell movement and orientation in the seminiferous epithelium. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33846786558	Targeted and reversible disruption of the blood-testis barrier by an FSH mutant-occludin peptide conjugate	The blood-testis barrier (BTB) is one of the tightest blood-tissue barriers in mammals. As such, it poses a challenge to deliver any drugs to the seminiferous epithelium of the testis, such as a nonhormonal male contraceptive. To circumvent this problem, a genetically engineered follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) mutant protein was produced in Spodoptera furgiperda (Sf)-9 insect cells to serve as a testis-specific carrier. Subsequently, a 22-amino acid peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop of occludin, which was known to disrupt BTB integrity in vivo, was inserted to the FSH mutant by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as well as chemical cross-linking. This molecule was found to have negligible hormonal activity but was still capable of binding to FSH receptors, which are restricted to Sertoli cells in mammals. When this FSH mutant-occludin peptide conjugate was administered to adult rats at 40 μg/adult rat (∼300 gm b.w.) via intraperitoneally (i.p.) injection, it induced transient and reversible disruption of the BTB, while at 150 μg/rat, it induced partial germ cell loss from the testis, particularly elongating/elongate spermatids. Most importantly, this effect was limited to the BTB without compromising the TJ-barrier integrity or cell adhesion in epithelia of other organs, such as kidney, liver, and small intestine. In summary, the use of an FSH mutant-occludin peptide conjugate is a feasible nanodevice to transiently compromise the BTB. © FASEB.

33846786829	Dynamic II interacts with the cadherin- and occludin-based protein complexes at the blood-testis barrier in adult rat testes	In adult rat testes, blood-testis barrier (BTB) restructuring facilitates the migration of preleptotene spermatocytes from the basal to the adluminal compartment that occurs at stage VIII of the epithelial cycle. Structural proteins at the BTB must utilize an efficient mechanism (e.g. endocytosis) to facilitate its transient 'opening'. Dynamin II, a large GTPase known to be involved in endocytosis, was shown to be a product of Sertoli and germ cells in the testis. It was also localized to the BTB, as well as the apical ectoplasmic specialization (apical ES), during virtually all stages of the epithelial cycle. By co-immunoprecipitation, dynamin II was shown to associate with occludin, N-cadherin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), β-catenin, junctional adhesion molecule-A, and p130Cas, but not nectin-3. An in vivo model in rats previously characterized for studying adherens junction (AJ) dynamics in the testes by adjudin (formerly called AF-2364, 1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carhohydrizide) treatment was used in our studies. At the time of germ cell loss from the seminiferous epithelium as a result of adjudin-induced AJ restructuring without disrupting the BTB integrity, a significant decline in the steady-state dynamin II protein level was detected. This change was associated with a concomitant increase in the levels of two protein complexes at the BTB, namely occludin/ZO-1 and N-cadherin/ β-catenin. Interestingly, these changes were also accompanied by a significant increase in the structural interaction of dynamin II with β-catenin and ZO-1. β-Catenin and ZO-1 are adaptors that structurally link the cadherin- and occludin-based protein complexes together at the BTB in an 'engaged'state to reinforce the barrier function in normal testes. However, β-catenin and ZO-1 were 'disengaged' from each other but bound to dynamin II during adjudin-induced AJ restructuring in the testis. The data reported herein suggest that dynamin II may assist the 'disengagement' of β-catenin from ZO-1 during BTB restructuring. Thus, this may permit the occludin /ZO-1 complexes to maintain the BTB integrity when the cadherin/catenin complexes are dissociated to facilitate germ cell movement. © 2006 Society for Endocrinology.

33947367483	Unraveling the molecular targets pertinent to junction restructuring events during spermatogenesis using the Adjudin-induced germ cell depletion model	During spermatogenesis, extensive restructuring takes place at the Sertoli-Sertoli and Sertoli-germ cell interface, which is regulated via intriguing interactions among cytokines, proteases, protease inhibitors, kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors. This in turn determines the steady-state levels of integral membrane proteins at the cell junctions. We sought to further expand these observations using the Adjudin model. Adjudin is a potential male contraceptive that targets Sertoli-germ cell adhesion, causing exfoliation of spermatids and spermatocytes, but not spermatogonia, from the seminiferous epithelium. This model thus provides the means to identify crucial regulatory molecules and signaling pathways pertinent to junction restructuring events during spermatogenesis. In this study, genome-wide expression profiling of rat testes after treatment with Adjudin at the time of extensive junction restructuring was performed. Differentially regulated genes, such as cytokines, proteases, protease inhibitors, cell junction-associated proteins, and transcription factors pertinent to junction restructuring were identified. These data were consistent with earlier findings; however, much new information was obtained which has been deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository website: http://viww.ncbi.nih.gov/geo/ with Accession number: GSE5131. The primary signaling events pertinent to junction restructuring in the testis induced by Adjudin were also delineated using bioinformatics. These findings were also consistent with recently published reports. The identified molecular signatures or targets pertinent to junction dynamics in the testis as reported herein, many of which have not been investigated, thus offer a framework upon which the regulation of junction restructuring events at the Sertoli-Sertoli and Sertoli-germ cell interface pertinent to spermatogenesis can be further studied. © 2007 Society for Endocrinology.

33847653845	Double diffusion from a vertical wavy surface in a porous medium saturated with a non-Newtonian fluid	This paper reports a study on the phenomenon of double diffusion near a vertical sinusoidal wavy surface in a porous medium saturated with a non-Newtonian power-law fluid with constant wall temperature and concentration. A coordinate transformation is employed to transform the complex wavy surface to a smooth surface, and the obtained boundary layer equations are then solved by the cubic spline collocation method. Effects of Lewis number, buoyancy ratio, power-law index, and wavy geometry on the Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are studied. The mean Nusselt and Sherwood numbers for a wavy surface are found to be smaller than those for the corresponding smooth surface. An increase in the power-law index leads to a smaller fluctuation of the local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers. Moreover, increasing the power-law index tends to increase both the thermal boundary layer thickness and the concentration boundary layer thickness, thus decreasing the mean Nusselt and Sherwood numbers. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Since hypofunction of NMDA receptors has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, we explored the hypothesis that genetic variants of the PSD-95 gene were associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Three PSD-95 polymorphisms were studied in a sample population of 248 people with schizophrenia and 208 normal controls. One polymorphism (rs373339) was not informative in our Chinese population while the other two polymorphisms (rs2521985 and rs17203281) were analysed with chi-square tests and haplotype analysis. Results demonstrated that the two informative polymorphisms are in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other. Neither single marker nor haplotype analysis revealed an association between variants at the PSD-95 locus and schizophrenia, suggesting that it is unlikely that the PSD-95 polymorphisms investigated play a substantial role in conferring susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Chinese population. Further genetic studies in schizophrenia with other PSD-95-like molecules that interact with the glutamate system are suggested. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

However, the distribution pattern and physiological function of CAR in the testis is still not clear. Here, we identified CAR in Sertoli cells and germ cells of rats. In vivo studies have shown that CAR resides at the blood-testis barrier as well as at the ectoplasmic specialization. The persistent expression of CAR in rat testes from neonatal period throughout adulthood implicates its role in spermatogenesis. Using primary Sertoli cell cultures, we observed a significant induction of CAR during the formation of Sertoli cell epithelium. Furthermore, CAR was seen to be concentrated at inter-Sertoli cell junctions, co-localizing with tight junction protein marker ZO-1 and adherens junction protein N-cadherin. CAR was also found to be associated with proteins of Src kinase family and its protein level declined after TNFα treatment in Sertoli cell cultures. Immunofluorescent staining of isolated germ cells has revealed the presence of CAR on spermatogonia, spermatocytes, round spermatids and elongate spermatids. Taken together, we propose that CAR functions as an adhesion molecule in maintaining the inter-Sertoli cell junctions at the basal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium. In addition, CAR may confer adhesion between Sertoli and germ cells at the Sertoli-germ cell interface. It is possible that the receptor utilized by viral pathogens to breakthrough the epithelial barrier was also employed by developing germ cells to migrate through the inter-Sertoli cell junctions. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

34248370971	Nonsimilar solutions for free convection from horizontal cylinders of elliptic cross section embedded in porous media using a thermal non-equilibrium model	This work presents a nonsimilar boundary layer analysis for free convection heat transfer near a horizontal cylinder of elliptic cross section with constant wall temperature in a fluid-saturated porous medium using a thermal non-equilibrium model. The governing equations are nondimensionalized and transformed into nonsimilar boundary layer equations. The transformed governing equations are then solved by the cubic spline collocation method. This work studies the effects of the porosity scaled thermal conductivity ratio, the heat transfer coefficient between solid and fluid phases, and the aspect ratio on the heat transfer rates when the major axis of the elliptical cylinder is vertical (slender orientation) and horizontal (blunt orientation). Increasing the porosity scaled thermal conductivity ratio or the heat transfer coefficient between the solid and fluid phases tends to increase the heat transfer rates. Moreover, the local Nusselt number for the porous medium for the elliptical cylinder with slender orientation is found to be higher than that with blunt orientation.

The integral method is applied to obtain the solution. The effects of the buoyancy ratio, the Lewis number, the buoyancy parameter, and the magnetic parameter on the local Nusselt number, the local Sherwood number, and the ratio of the thermal boundary layer thickness to the concentration boundary layer thickness are studied. An increase in the buoyancy parameter tends to increase the local Nusselt number and the local Sherwood number. However, increasing the magnetic parameter decreases the local Nusselt number and the local Sherwood number.

34447126389	Ab initio studies of possible magnetism in a BN sheet by nonmagnetic impurities and vacancies	We performed first-principles calculations to investigate the possible magnetism induced by different concentrations of nonmagnetic impurities and vacancies in a BN sheet. Atoms of Be, B, C, N, O, Al, and Si are used to replace either B or N in the system as impurities. We discuss the changes in the density of states as well as the extent of the spatial distribution of the defect states, the possible formation of magnetic moments, the magnitude of the magnetization energies, and finally the exchange energies due to the presence of these defects. It is shown that the magnetization energy tends to increase as the concentration of the defects decreases in most of the defect systems, which implies a definite preference for finite magnetic moments. The calculated exchange energies are in general tiny but not completely insignificant for two of the studied defect systems, i.e., one with O impurities substituting for N and the other with B vacancies. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34547632706	Transient mixed convection heat and mass transfer with chemical reaction along a vertical wavy plate in a micropolar fluid	The transient mixed convection heat and mass transfer with chemical reaction along a vertical wavy surface in micropolar fluids is studied by the coordinate transformation and the cubic spline collocation method. Effects of chemical reaction parameter, vortex viscosity parameter, thermal buoyancy number, concentration buoyancy number, Prandtl number, and Schmidt number on the transient local values of Nusselt number and Sherwood number are presented. In a mixed convection boundary layer, forced convection is the dominant mode of heat and mass transfer near the leading edge or at small time, while in regions farther downstream or at large time, natural convection becomes the dominant mode of heat and mass transfer. Increasing the generative chemical reaction parameter increases the surface heat transfer rate and decreases the surface mass transfer rate.

A 256-word × 32-BL-pair 3T1D gain cell array is implemented in standard logic technology with TSMC 0.13um model for multi-bank Pseudo SRAM. Each Pseudo SRAM has its independent access control unit, enabling parallel refresh and read-write accesses to different bank. By employing power gating technique in sense amplifier of 3T1D gain cell array, 15% standby leakage current: during sleep mode could be reduced. Also, 12% sensing speed could be enhanced when Pseudo SRAM is operated in normal mode (simulated with TSMC 100nm technology model). © 2007 IEEE.

The result showed that the correlation coefficient between real-time PCR estimates and thiosulphate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose (TCBS) plate counts of V. parahaemolyticus was 0.98. The sensitivity of real-time quantitative PCR assay was 2 × 10° copies for pure V. parahaemolyticus culture. A known number of V. parahaemolyticus target cells were inoculated to oyster and DNA was extracted for real-time PCR analysis. The sensitivity was 1.32 log CFU/g for V. parahaemolyticus inoculated to the oyster. The duration of the entire experiment from DNA isolation and purification to PCR amplification was less than 12 h. This study demonstrated that real-time PCR is a rapid and reliable technique for detecting V. parahaemolyticus possessing the tlh gene in pure culture and in oyster.

A coordinate transformation is employed to transform the complex wavy conical surface to a smooth conical surface, and the transformed nonsimilar boundary layer governing equations are then solved by the cubic spline collocation method. Effects of the Lewis number, buoyancy ratio, half cone angle and wavy geometry on the Nusselt and Sherwood numbers for a frustum of a sinusoidal wavy cone in porous media are studied. The harmonic curves for the local Nusselt number and those for local Sherwood number as functions of streamwise coordinate have a frequency twice the frequency of the wavy conical surface. Moreover, an increase in the amplitude-wavelength ratio raises the amplitude of the local Nusselt number and the local Sherwood number. Further, the average Sherwood number and the average Nusselt number for a frustum of a wavy cone are found to be smaller than those for the corresponding smooth frustum cone. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The transformed boundary layer governing equations are solved by the cubic spline collocation method. Results for local Nusselt numbers are presented as functions of vortex viscosity parameter, the surface temperature exponent, and the Prandtl number. The heat transfer rates of the truncated cones with higher surface temperature exponents are higher than those with lower surface temperature exponents.

38049089274	The effect of rigid versus flexible spinal orthosis on the gait pattern of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis	The conventional rigid spinal orthosis and the flexible spinal orthosis, SpineCor, have different treatment principles in the management of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). These may influence the patients' gait pattern and clinical outcome. In this study, gait analysis on patients with AIS undergoing these two orthotic interventions were conducted. The patients' lower limb kinematic and kinetic data during level walking were collected using a motion analysis system and two force platforms in four test conditions: pre-intervention, having used the orthosis for 1 month and 1 year (in and out of the orthosis). Twenty-one subjects were randomly assigned to the rigid spinal orthosis group (10 subjects) and the SpineCor group (11 subjects). Neither group showed gait asymmetry when comparing the convex and concave sides in the four test conditions. However, significant reduction in the range of motion of the pelvis and hip joints in the coronal plane were found. Although patients with AIS undergoing these two orthotic interventions showed significant changes in walking pattern within the study period, their long-term effect on gait and function requires further investigation through long-term prospective studies. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

0033562548	UV inducibility of rat proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene promoter	Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), also known as a cofactor of DNA polymerase 8, is required for eukaryotic cell DNA synthesis and nucleotide excision repair. Expression of PCNA gene is growth-regulated and UV inducible. In our previous study, we have observed that the rat PCNA promoter has the serum responsiveness. In this study, we demonstrate its UV inducibility in CHO.K1 cells. The UV induction of the rat PCNA promoter activity was dose-dependent in the cells synchronized at different phases. In addition, the sequences of the promoter responsible for the UV inducibility were delimited to the region between nucleotides -70 and +125, which contains an AP-1 site and a downstream proximal ATF/CRE site. While mutation of the AP-1 site abrogated the UV inducibility, mutation of the ATF/CRE site enhanced the UV inducibility, suggesting that the two sites play different roles in the UV induction of the promoter. In addition, the role of p53 in the UV induction of rat PCNA promoter was investigated. We found that exogenous p53 was unable to mimic the UV irradiation to induce rat PCNA promoter and that the UV induction of the rat PCNA promoter was seen in p53 deficient cells. Therefore, it is unlikely that the UV induction of the rat PCNA promoter is p53 dependent.

The flow is exposed to a transverse magnetic field. The integral method is applied to obtain the analytic solution. Results are illustrated graphically for various features of the solutions. The application of a transverse magnetic field normal to the flow direction decreases the Nusselt number and Sherwood number. Moreover, the thickness ratio of the thermal boundary layer to the concentration boundary layer is found to be independent of the intensity of the magnetic field.

However, the identities of many of these putative biological factors are not known. The aim of this study is to present a strategy to identify and purify germ cell derived proteins found in germ cell-conditioned medium (GCCM) at a quantity sufficient to permit protein microsequencing. The purification scheme of a novel germ cell-derived protein from GCCM designated GC-26 is presented along with several germ cell proteins using a combination of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) columns. The purity of GC-26 and other germ cell proteins were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and silver staining.

0033690453	Transient heat and mass transfer by natural convection from vertical surfaces in porous media	A study on the transient heat and mass transfer from vertical plates embedded in fluid saturated porous media is conducted. The wall temperature and concentration are power functions of the dimensionless streamwise coordinate. Results for the heat and mass transfer rates are obtained for different values of the Lewis number, the buoyancy ratio, the power-law exponent and the ratio of porosity and heat capacity ratio. The transient local Nusselt number at X = 1 is found to be almost independent of the ratio of porosity and heat capacity ratio, while the transient local Sherwood number at X = 1 tends to increase as the ratio of porosity and heat capacity ratio is increased. Moreover, increasing the power-law exponent increases the transient local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers.

The effects of intercooling on the maximum power and maximum-power efficiency of an endoreversible Brayton cycle are examined. With appropriate temperature ratios of turbines and compressors being used, the maximum power output of an endoreversible intercooled Brayton cycle can be higher than that of an endoreversible simple Brayton cycle without lowering the thermal efficiency. New diagrams for maximum power, maximum-power thermal efficiency, and optimum temperature ratios of turbines and compressors are reported. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

0033842224	Lonidamine and analogue AF2785 block the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-activated chloride current and chloride secretion in the rat epididymis	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) or the small conductance cAMP-activated chloride channel encoded by the CFTR gene has been shown to play an important role in the formation of the epididymal fluid microenvironment. Mutation of the gene has led to widespread effects on male reproduction. Like other ion channels, CFTR is amenable to pharmacological intervention. Blocking CFTR in the epididymis could in principle lead to disruption of the epididymal fluid environment. We report for the first time two indazole compounds: Ionidamine and 1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-indazole-3-acrylic acid (AF2785) are potent blockers of CFTR in the epididymis.

The integral method is applied to obtain the analytic solution. Results are illustrated graphically for the local Nusselt number, the local Sherwood number, and the reciprocal of the boundary layer thickness ratio. The thickness ratio of the thermal boundary layer to the concentration boundary layer is independent of the exponent of the power function used to describe the wall concentration and concentration. Moreover, the ratio of the thermal boundary layer thickness to the concentration boundary layer thickness increases as the buoyancy ratio is increased for Le ≠ 1.

38949160760	Comparison of the time to perceived exertion in cycling with different warm-up procedures	This study investigated the effect of active, passive, and no warm-up on the time of reaching 75% of maximu exertion in cycling ergometry testing. The study adopted a randomized repeated measures design. A total of 20 able-bodied adults (11 males, 9 females) were tested in three sessions in random order, namely active warm-up, passive warm-up, and no warm-up. Active warm-up comprised active stretching of thigh muscles, treadmill running, and cycling on an ergometer at low intensity. Passive warm-up comprised passive stretching, hot pack, and massage to both thighs. All subjects underwent cycling ergometry testing with a constant work output in each session. The main outcome measure was the time to reach a level of 15 in the rate of perceived exertion (RPE). Results showed a significant difference (p=0.04) in the exercise time before reaching RPE 15 among the three conditions. Post hoc analysis revealed that subjects had longer exercise time after passive warm-up than active warm-up and no warm-up (p=0.05 and p=0.04, respectively). This result suggests that passive warm-up prior to exercise could lengthen exercise time before subjects reach a high level of perceived exertion in cycling. © 2007 Elsevier. All rights reserved.

39749199006	Transient laminar forced convection heat transfer of power-law fluids along a wavy plate	The transient laminar forced convection of power-law fluids along a wavy surface is studied by the coordinate transformation and the cubic spline collocation method. Effects of the power-law index and the amplitude-wavelength ratio on the Nusselt number and the skin-friction coefficient are examined. The fluid with larger power-law index has larger transient local Nusselt numbers at the leading edge; as the fluid moves downstream from the leading edge, the transient local Nusselt number and the transient mean Nusselt number of dilatant fluids decrease rapidly while those of pseudoplastic fluids increase. The transient local skin-friction coefficient decreases as the power-law index is increased. Moreover, the harmonic curves for the transient local Nusselt number and the transient local skin-friction coefficient have the same wave number as that of the wavy surface.

The second system realizes mass customization for car interior design. Online ergonomic evaluation is conducted based on the interactions between a digital human mimicking the user and the design model. Finally, an Internet-based design review system is implemented. It enables synchronous communications between a designer and people involved in the change process with no access to CAD. These prototypes demonstrate the practicality, flexibility, and versatility of the WCV in integration with other proprietary software tools using a variety of platforms like ASP framework, Java-based technology, and Windows C/C++ applications.

34247597228	Transactivation of Src, PDGF receptor, and Akt is involved in IL-1β-induced ICAM-1 expression in A549 cells	In previous study, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has been shown to induce ICAM-1 expression through MAPKs and NF-κB in A549 cells. In addition to these pathways, transactivation of non-receptor tyrosine kinase (Src), PDGF receptors (PDGFRs), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt has been implicated in the expression of inflammatory genes. Here, we further investigated whether these different mechanisms participating in IL-1β-induced ICAM-1 expression in A549 cells. We initially observed that IL-1β-induced ICAM-1 promoter activity was attenuated by the inhibitors of Src (PP1), PDGFR (AG1296), PI3-K (LY294002 and wortmannin), and Akt (SH-5), revealed by reporter gene assay, Western blotting, and RT-PCR analyses. The involvement of Src and PI3-K/Akt in IL-1β-induced ICAM-1 expression was significantly attenuated by transfection of A549 cells with dominant negative plasmids of Src, p85 and Akt, respectively. Src, PDGFR, and PI3K/Akt mediated the effects of IL-1βbecause pretreatment with PP1, AG1296, and wortmannin also abrogated IL-1β-stimulated Src, PDGFR, and Akt phosphorylation, respectively. Moreover, pretreatment with p300 inhibitor (curcumin) also blocked ICAM-1 expression. We further confirmed that p300 was associated with ICAM-1 promoter which was dynamically linked to histone H4 acetylation stimulated by IL-1β, determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Association of p300 and histone-H4 to ICAM-1 promoter was inhibited by LY294002. Up-regulation of ICAM-1 enhanced the adhesion of neutrophils onto A549 cell monolayer exposed to IL-1β, which was inhibited by PP1, AG1296, LY294002, wortmannin, and helenalin. These results suggested that Akt phosphorylation mediated through transactivation of Src/PDGFR promotes the transcriptional p300 activity and eventually leads to ICAM-1 expression induced by IL-1β. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

34249986748	Regulation of cell junction dynamics by cytokines in the testis-A molecular and biochemical perspective	Studies in the past decade in the field have demonstrated the significance of cytokines in regulating epithelial and endothelial cell junctions including tight and anchoring junctions in multiple organs including the testis. There are mounting evidences in recent years that cytokines play a crucial role in the restructuring of junctions at the Sertoli-Sertoli and Sertoli-germ cell interface in the seminiferous epithelium during spermatogenesis. These earlier studies, however, were focused on the effects of cytokines in maintaining the steady-state protein levels of integral membrane proteins at the sites of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) and anchoring junctions at the Sertoli-Sertoli and Sertoli-germ cell interface, such as basal and apical ectoplasmic specialization, respectively. The molecular pathway(s) and/or mechanism(s) underlying these effects remained virtually unexplored until very recently. Herein, we summarize and provide some discussions on studies that focused on the role of cytokines in regulating junction restructuring events in epithelia from a molecular and biochemical perspective. Specifically, we use the adult rat or mouse testis as a model to highlight the significance of transcriptional and translational regulation. Specific areas of research that require further attentions are also highlighted. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A coordinate transformation is used to obtain the nonsimilar boundary layer equations. The transformed boundary layer equations are then solved by the cubic spline collocation method. Results for the local Nusselt numbers are presented as functions of the porosity scaled thermal conductivity ratio, the heat transfer coefficient between solid and fluid phases, the transpiration parameter, and the aspect ratio when the major axis of the elliptical cylinder is vertical (slender orientation) and horizontal (blunt orientation). An increase in the porosity scaled thermal conductivity ratio or the heat transfer coefficient between the solid and fluid phases increases the heat transfer rates. Moreover, the use of suction (positive transpiration parameter) tends to increase the heat transfer rates between the porous medium and the surface. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40549089888	Biomechanical analysis of nonconstrained and semiconstrained total elbow replacements: A preliminary report	The development of elbow arthroplasties has significantly improved the quality of life for many patients suffering from disabling elbow disorders. However, the high complication rate such as loosening and instability limits the long term use of total elbow replacement (TER). In the present study, biomechanical analyses on patients with unilateral nonconstrained (Souter-Strathclyde) and semiconstrained (Coonard-Morrey) TER subjects were performed to investigate differences of their motion patterns under unloaded and loaded conditions. In a biomechanical laboratory, each subject performed vertical and horizontal elbow flexion/extension first without and then with external loading (5 lb). The kinematic data were measured using 3D motion analysis system and the motion axis of the elbow was calculated by a well-defined mathematic model. During these tests, the upperarm was fixed with a special fixation device and their forearms fully supinated. The elbow motion patterns of the affected sides were compared with those of the normal sides and between different conditions. The results revealed that the elbows moved about a relatively fixed axis both in the semiconstrained and nonconstrained groups in the vertical flexion/extension with or without external loading, compatible with the normal elbows. However, the nonconstrained elbows were less stable during horizontal flexion/externsion motion with or without external loading and the elbow axis moved significantly, indicating of less stability. We conclude that this methodology of elbow motion analysis is acceptable and can be widely recommended for total elbow study. Moreover, the nonconstrained TER is less stable than the semiconstrained TER during the horizontal movement, which was compatible with previous clinical results. The patients with nonconstrained TER are suggested to avoid using their elbows in horizontal motion, especially in loaded conditions.

0034310505	Natural convection heat and mass transfer near a vertical wavy surface with constant wall temperature and concentration in a porous medium	This paper reports a study of the phenomenon of natural convection heat and mass transfer near a vertical wavy surface embedded in a fluid-saturated porous medium. The buoyancy effect is due to the variation of temperature and concentration across the boundary layer. A simple coordinate transformation is employed to transform the complex wavy surface to a flat plate, and the obtained boundary layer equations is then solved by the local nonsimilarity method and the cubic spline collocation method. Effects of the Lewis number, the buoyancy ratio, and the wavy geometry on the local Sherwood number and the local Nusselt number are studied. The harmonic curves for the local Sherwood number and the local Nusselt number have a frequency twice the frequency of the wavy surface. Moreover, increasing the amplitude-wavelength ratio tends to increase the amplitude of the local Sherwood number and the local Nusselt number. Further, the average Sherwood number and the average Nusselt number for a sinusoidal wavy surface are found to be constantly smaller than that of the corresponding flat plate.

0034694807	Cloning and characterization of a novel nuclear Bcl-2 family protein, zfMcl-1a, in zebrafish embryo	The importance of the Bcl-2 family proteins in normal vertebrate embryogenesis is being recognized; however, their regulatory mechanism is poorly understood. To elucidate the embryonic roles of Bcl-2 family proteins, we cloned and characterized the first zebrafish Bcl-2 family protein, zfMcl-1a. Zebrafish Mcl-1a shows the highest homology to rat Mcl-1 and contains several conserved BH domains of the Bcl-2 family proteins. It also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Using EGFP reporter analysis, we verified the nuclear localization of zfMcl-1a. Deletion of the NLS resulted in distribution of the fusion protein in the cytoplasm. Northern blot analysis indicated that zfMcl-1a mRNA is 1.5 kb and was expressed in oocytes and throughout embryonic development. Notably, the expression of zfMcl-1a transcript was significantly downregulated during gastrulation. These results suggest that zfMcl-1a is a novel nuclear Bcl-2 family protein and is likely to play an important role in zebrafish oogenesis and embryogenesis. © 2000 Academic Press.

43149125426	Genome-wide mapping and characterization of hypomethylated sites in human tissues and breast cancer cell lines	We have developed a method for mapping unmethylated sites in the human genome based on the resistance of TspRI-digested ends to ExoIII nuclease degradation. Digestion with TspRI and methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HpaII, followed by ExoIII and single-strand DNA nuclease allowed removal of DNA fragments containing unmethylated HpaII sites. We then used array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to map the sequences depleted by these procedures in human genomes derived from five human tissues, a primary breast tumor, and two breast tumor cell lines. Analysis of methylation patterns of the normal tissue genomes indicates that the hypomethylated sites are enriched in the 5′ end of widely expressed genes, including promoter, first exon, and first intron. In contrast, genomes of the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines show extensive hypomethylation in the intragenic and intergenic regions whereas the primary tumor exhibits a pattern between those of the normal tissue and the cell lines. A striking characteristic of tumor cell lines is the presence of megabase-sized hypomethylated zones. These hypomethylated zones are associated with large genes, fragile sites, evolutionary breakpoints, chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints, tumor suppressor genes, and with regions containing tissue-specific gene clusters or with gene-poor regions containing novel tissue-specific genes. Correlation with microarray analysis shows that genes with a hypomethylated sequence 2 kb up- or downstream of the transcription start site are highly expressed, whereas genes with extensive intragenic and 3′ untranslated region (UTR) hypomethylation are silenced. The method described herein can be used for large-scale screening of changes in the methylation pattern in the genome of interest. ©2008 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

Results for the local Nusselt number and the local Sherwood number are presented as functions of the vortex viscosity parameter, Schmidt number, buoyancy ratio, and Prandtl number. For micropolar fluids, higher viscosity tends to retard the flow and thus decreases the natural convection heat and mass transfer rates from the sphere with constant wall temperature and concentration.

44349122919	High incidence of initial loss of consciousness with abnormal F-18 FDG and O-15 water brain PET in patients with chronic closed head injury	Background: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of loss of consciousness (LOC) with functional abnormalities by brain positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with closed head injury using fluorine-18 labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) and O-15 water PET imaging. Methods: 36 sequential patients referred from rehabilitation service without known brain disease who had cognitive complaints months after head injury and had F-18 FDG and O-15 water PET, CT and/or MRI imaging were included. The image findings were compared and correlated with the incidence of initial LOC. Results: Significant difference was found in the association of abnormal imaging findings with LOC between functional (PET) and anatomical (CT or MRI) modalities. There was also significant discrepancy between PET and CT/MRI findings. Of the 28 patients with normal CT or MRI, 10 patients or 36% had abnormal PET findings (p=0.007). However, there was, however, high concordance (92%) between perfusion and metabolic PET images. Conclusion: There are significantly more functional than anatomic abnormalities in chronic closed head injury. PET may help in confirming the diagnosis and subsequent management when CT/MRI is normal. Those with normal PET are less likely to have LOC at the time of initial injury. Copyright © 2008 JMS.

44349188184	Tumor necrosis factor-α induces MMP-9 expression via p42/p44 MAPK, JNK, and nuclear factor-κB in A549 cells	Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), in particular MMP-9, have been shown to be induced by cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and contributes to airway inflammation. However, the mechanisms underlying MMP-9 expression induced by TNF-α in human A549 cells remain unclear. Here, we showed that TNF-α induced production of MMP-9 protein and mRNA is determined by zymographic, Western blotting, RT-PCR and ELISA assay, which were attenuated by inhibitors of MEK1/2 (U0126), JNK (SP600125), and NF-κB (helenalin), and transfection with dominant negative mutants of ERK2 (ΔERK) and JNK (ΔJNK), and siRNAs for MEK1, p42 and JNK2. TNF-α-stimulated phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and JNK were attenuated by pretreatment with the inhibitors U0126 and SP600125 or transfection with dominant negative mutants of ΔERK and ΔJNK. Furthermore, the involvement of NF-κB in TNF-α-induced MMP-9 production was consistent with that TNF-α-stimulated degradation of IκB-α and translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus which were blocked by helenalin, but not by U0126 and SP600125, revealed by immunofluorescence staining. The regulation of MMP-9 gene transcription by MAPKs and NF-κB was further confirmed by gene luciferase activity assay. MMP-9 promoter activity was enhanced by TNF-α in A549 cells transfected with wild-type MMP-9-Luc, which was inhibited by helenalin, U0126, or SP600125. In contrast, TNF-α-stimulated MMP-9 luciferase activity was totally lost in cells transfected with mutant-NF-κB MMP-9-luc. Moreover, pretreatment with actinomycin D and cycloheximide attenuated TNF-α-induced MMP-9 expression. These results suggest that in A549 cells, phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK, JNK, and transactivation of NF-κB are essential for TNF-α-induced MMP-9 gene expression. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

44949190438	Blood-testis barrier dynamics are regulated by testosterone and cytokines via their differential effects on the kinetics of protein endocytosis and recycling in Sertoli cells	During spermatogenesis in the mammalian testis, preleptotene/leptotene spermatocytes differentiate from type B spermatogonia and traverse the blood-testis barrier (BTB) at stage VIII of the seminiferous epithelial cycle for further development. This timely movement of germ cells involves extensive junction restructuring at the BTB. Previous studies have shown that these events are regulated by testosterone (T) and cytokines [e.g., the transforming growth factor (TGF) -βs], which promote and disrupt the BTB assembly, respectively. However, the mechanisms underlying the "opening" of the BTB above a migrating preleptotene/leptotene spermatocyte and the "resealing" of the barrier underneath this cell remain obscure. We now report findings on a novel mechanism utilized by the testes to regulate these events. Using cell surface protein biotinylation coupled with immunoblotting and immunofluorescent microscopy, we assessed the kinetics of endocytosis and recycling of BTB-associated integral membrane proteins: occludin, JAM-A, and N-cadherin. It was shown that these proteins were continuously endocytosed and recycled back to the Sertoli cell surface via the clathrin-mediated but not the caveolin-mediated pathway. When T or TGF-β2 was added to Sertoli cell cultures with established functional BTB, both factors accelerated the kinetics of internalization of BTB proteins from the cell surface, perhaps above the migrating preleptotene spermatocyte, thereby opening the BTB. Likewise, T also enhanced the kinetics of recycling of internalized biotinylated proteins back to the cell surface, plausibly relocating these proteins beneath the migrating spermatocyte to reassemble the BTB. In contrast, TGF-β2 targeted internalized biotinylated proteins to late endosomes for degradation, destabilizing the BTB. In summary, the transient opening of the BTB that facilitates germ cell movement is mediated via the differential effects of T and cytokines on the kinetics of endocytosis and recycling of integral membrane proteins at the BTB. The net result of these interactions, in turn, determines the steady-state protein levels at the Sertoli-Sertoli cell interface at the BTB. © FASEB.

4644258664	Matrix metalloproteinase-8 in sera and from polymorphonuclear leucocytes in rheumatoid arthritis: In vitro characterization and correlation with disease activity	Objectives. To determine matrix metalloproteinase- 8 (MMP-8) secretion from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs), in response to immune complexes (IC), cytokines and their combinations, and to study correlation of serum MMP-8 with disease activity. Methods. PMNs from RA patients and controls were stimulated in vitro with interleukin -15 (IL-15), IL-18, adherent immune complexes, rabbit anti-human immunoglobulin G (anti-HIgG), human immunoglobulin G (HIgG), and their F (ab') 2 prongs, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or combinations of above. Supernatants from these experiments and sera from both groups were assayed for MMP-8 using ELISA and correlated with disease activity measures in patients. Results. MMP-8 secretion from stimulated PMNs was compared to unstimulated PMNs. Immune complexes elicited significant MMP-8 secretion (p=0.006 and 0.001, control and RA respectively). Unlike HIgG and its F (ab')2 fragment. very high secretion was elicited by anti-HIgG (242.37±10.85 ng/ml) and its F (ab')2 prong (195.85±28.67 ng/ml). IL-15 did not elicit any secretion. IL-18 with PMA increased secretion significantly only from RA PMNs (p=0.003). Serum MMP-8 correlated positively with serum CRP (p=0.017) and not with disease activity score (p=0.199). Conclusions. We for the first time demonstrate that immune complexes elicit MMP-8 secretion from PMNs. Except for higher secretion from RA PMNs in response to combination of IL-18 and PMA, both control and RA PMNs respond similarly to various stimuli. Secretion by anti-HIgG occurs by a mechanism independent of Fc receptor. Correlation with CRP suggest that serum MMP-8 may be an indicator of acute inflammatory activity. © Copyright Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2004.

47749101115	An autocrine axis in the testis that coordinates spermiation and blood-testis barrier restructuring during spermatogenesis	The mechanism(s) that regulate and coordinate the events of spermiation and blood-testis barrier (BTB) restructuring in the seminiferous epithelium that occur concurrently at stage VIII of the seminiferous epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis are unknown. In this report, fragments derived from the laminin complex composed of laminin α3, β3, and γ3 chains (laminin-333) at the apical ectoplasmic specialization (apical ES) were shown to modulate BTB dynamics directly and/or indirectly via hemidesmosome. Experiments were performed using cultured Sertoli cells with functional tight junction (TJ) barrier and the ultrastructural features of the BTB but not apical ES. Recombinant protein fragments of laminin β3 and γ3 chains were shown to reduce the protein levels of occludin and β1-integrin dose dependently at the Sertoli-Sertoli and Sertoli-basement membrane interface, respectively, thereby destabilizing the BTB permeability function. These results were corroborated by transient overexpression of laminin fragments in Sertoli cells. To further assess the role of β1-integrin in hemidesmosome, knockdown of β1-integrin in Sertoli cells by RNAi was found to associate with occludin redistribution at the Sertoli-Sertoli cell interface, wherein occludin moved away from the cell surface and became associated with endosomes, thereby destabilizing the BTB. In short, an apical ES-BTB-hemidesmosome autocrine regulatory axis was identified in testes, coordinating the events of spermiation and BTB restructuring that occur at the opposite ends of the seminiferous epithelium during spermatogenesis. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

47749130863	Par3/Par6 polarity complex coordinates apical ectoplasmic specialization and blood-testis barrier restructuring during spermatogenesis	The Par3/Par6/aPKC and the CRB3/Pals1/PATJ polarity complexes are involved in regulating apical ectoplasmic specialization (ES) and blood-testis barrier (BTB) restructuring in the testis. Par6 was a component of the apical ES and the BTB. However, its level was considerably diminished at both sites at stage VIII of the cycle. Par6 also formed a stable complex with Pals1 and JAM-C (a component of the apical ES) in normal testes. When rats were treated with adjudin to induce apical ES restructuring without compromising the BTB, Par6 staining virtually disappeared at the apical ES in misaligned spermatids before their depletion. Additionally, the Par6/Pals1 complex became tightly associated with Src kinase, rendering a loss of association of the Par6/Pals1 complex with JAM-C, thereby destabilizing apical ES to facilitate spermatid loss. Primary Sertoli cell cultures with established functional BTB, but without apical ES, were next used to assess the Par6-based complex on BTB dynamics. When either Par6 or Par3 was knocked down by RNAi in Sertoli cell epithelium, a significant loss of the corresponding protein by ≈60% in cells vs. controls was detected, alongside with a decline in aPKC after Par6, but not Par3, knockdown. This Par3 or Par6 knockdown also led to a transient loss of selected BTB proteins at the cell-cell interface, thereby compromising the BTB integrity. These findings illustrate that the Par6/Par3-based polarity complex likely coordinates the events of apical ES and BTB restructuring that take place concurrently at the opposing ends of adjacent Sertoli cells in the seminiferous epithelium during spermatogenesis. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

55649110660	Sphingomyelin synthases and testicular function	Sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) is a cellular enzyme that catalyzes de novo synthesis of sphingomyelin (SM), which is a vital lipid component of cell membranes. Both members of the SMS family, SMS1 and SMS2, are found in mammalian testes and they are located in distinctive subcellular compartments, with SMS1 in the Golgi apparatus and SMS2 in the plasma membrane. At present, the precise function of SMS in the testis remains unknown. Recent studies have demonstrated an unique association of SMS2 with spermatids, particularly near developing acrosomes and the junction restructuring site at the apical ectoplasmic specialization (a testis-specific atypical adherens junction type) and Leydig cells in the rat testis. These data illustrate the possible involvement of SMS2 in spermiogenesis and, perhaps, steroidogenesis in male reproductive function. This review summarizes the latest findings on SMS in the field, particularly its role in testicular function. © 2008 Expert Reviews Ltd.

56349164164	Double-diffusive natural convection along a vertical wavy truncated cone in non-Newtonian fluid saturated porous media with thermal and mass stratification	This paper studies the double-diffusive natural convection near a vertical wavy truncated cone in a non-Newtonian fluid saturated porous medium with thermal and mass stratification. The surface of the truncated cone is kept at constant wall temperature and concentration. A coordinate transformation is employed to transform the complex wavy surface to a smooth surface, and the obtained boundary-layer equations are then solved by the cubic spline collocation method. Effects of thermal and concentration stratification parameters, Lewis number, buoyancy ratio, power-law index, and wavy geometry on the heat and mass transfer characteristics are studied. Results show that the streamwise distributions of the local Nusselt number and the local Sherwood number are harmonic curves with a wave number twice the wave number of the surface of the vertical wavy truncated cone. An increase in the power-law index leads to a smaller fluctuation of the local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers. Moreover, increasing the thermal and concentration stratification parameter decreases the buoyancy force and retards the flow, thus decreasing the heat and mass transfer rates between the fluid and the wavy surface of the vertical truncated cone. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

65649142526	Natural convection heat and mass transfer from a vertical truncated cone in a porous medium saturated with a non-Newtonian fluid with variable wall temperature and concentration	This work presents a boundary-layer analysis about the natural convection heat and mass transfer near a vertical truncated cone with variable wall temperature and concentration in a porous medium saturated with non-Newtonian power-law fluids. A coordinate transform is used to obtain the nonsimilar governing equations, and the transformed boundary-layer equations are solved by the cubic spline collocation method. Results for local Nusselt numbers are presented as functions of power-law indexes, surface temperature and concentration exponents, buoyancy ratios, and Lewis numbers. The heat and mass transfer rates of the truncated cones with higher surface temperature and concentration exponents are higher than those with lower exponents. Moreover, an increase in the power-law index of fluids tends to decrease the heat and mass transfer from a vertical truncated cone in a porous medium saturated with non-Newtonian power-law fluids. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

67649108872	Natural convection heat transfer of non-Newtonian fluids in porous media from a vertical cone under mixed thermal boundary conditions	This work studies the problem of the steady natural convection boundary layer flow over a downward-pointing vertical cone in porous media saturated with non-Newtonian power-law fluids under mixed thermal boundary conditions. A similarity analysis is performed, and the obtained similar equations are solved by cubic spline collocation method. The effects of the power-law viscosity index and the similarity exponent on the heat transfer characteristics under mixed thermal boundary conditions have been studied. Under mixed thermal boundary conditions, both the surface heat flux and the surface temperature are found to decrease when the power-law viscosity index of the non-Newtonian power-law fluid in porous media is increased. Moreover, an increase in the similarity exponent tends to increase the boundary layer thickness and thus decreases the surface heat flux under mixed thermal conditions. The generalized governing equations derived in this work can be applied to the cases of prescribed surface temperature and prescribed heat flux. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

66149133615	Using the practice environment scale of the nursing work index on asian nurses	Background: Researchers have used the Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index (PES-NWI) to examine the perception of practice environment among U.S. nurses in general; however, the scale has not been used to measure perceptions specifically among Asian nurses working in the United States, the largest group of international nurses in the nation. Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the reliability and the validity of the PES-NWI scale when applied to Asian nurses working in the United States. Methods: The study used a cross-sectional design with snowball sampling. Data from 230 Asian nurses who were born in Far Eastern countries and had worked at least 6 months in their current job at a U.S. hospital were analyzed, using Cronbach's alpha, item-total and interitem correlation, and factor analysis. Results: The Cronbach's alpha for the PES-NWI was .96, and the item-total correlation coefficients ranged from .49 to .79. Five factors, which explained 59.12% of variance in the perception of practice environment, emerged: Nurse Participation and Development; Nurse Manager Ability, Leadership, and Support of Nurses; Nursing Foundations for Quality of Care; Staffing and Resource Adequacy; and Collegial Nurse-Physician Relations. Four derived factors were reconstructed, and one factor was renamed based on the meanings of scale items that were included in the factor. Discussion: Study findings demonstrate that the PES-NWI is a reliable and a valid scale when applied to Asian nurses working in the United States. Findings also indicate that Asian nurses perceive practice environments differently than do American nurses, most likely due to dissimilar cultural beliefs. A better understanding of these differences may help develop more individualized support for Asian nurses as they adapt to working in the United States.

67349103777	Nonsimilar boundary layer analysis of double-diffusive convection from a vertical truncated cone in a porous medium with variable viscosity	This work presents a boundary layer analysis about variable viscosity effects on the double-diffusive convection near a vertical truncated cone in a fluid-saturated porous medium with constant wall temperature and concentration. The viscosity of the fluid is assumed to be an inverse linear function of the temperature. A boundary layer analysis is employed to derive the nondimensional nonsimilar governing equations, and the transformed boundary layer governing equations are solved by the cubic spline collocation method to yield computationally efficient numerical solutions. The obtained results are found to be in good agreement with previous papers on special cases of the problem. Results for local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are presented as functions of viscosity-variation parameter, buoyancy ratio, and Lewis number. For a porous medium saturated with a Newtonian fluid with viscosity proportional to an inverse linear function of temperature, higher value of viscosity-variation parameter leads to the decrease of the viscosity in fluid flow, thus increasing the fluid velocity as well as the local Nusselt number and the local Sherwood number. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

70450161975	Effects of stress and social support on postpartum health of chinese mothers in the United States	Postpartum maternal well being across cultures has received limited research attention. We examined relationships among stress, social support, and health in 152 Chinese mothers <1 year postpartum in the United States. These mothers did not perceive high levels of stress, although they did not receive as much support as they indicated they needed; 23.7% of mothers scored high for depressive symptoms. About half of the mothers experienced interrupted sleep, decrease in memory, and lack of sexual desire. All health measures were inter-correlated. Social support moderated the effects of stress on depressive symptoms. Culturally relevant care that is perceived as supportive may promote postpartum maternal health.© 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

0035047036	Transforming growth factor-β3 perturbs the inter-Sertoli tight junction permeability barrier in vitro possibly mediated via its effects on occludin, zonula occludens-1, and claudin-11	Throughout spermatogenesis, inter-Sertoli tight junctions (TJs) that create the blood-testis barrier in the rat must be disassembled and reassembled to permit the timely passage of preleptotene spermatocytes from the basal to the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium. However, the mechanism(s) and the participating molecules that regulate this event are largely unknown. Although there is no in vitro model to study the event and regulation of inter-Sertoli TJ disassembly, primary cultures of Sertoli cells in vitro can be used to study junction assembly. In this study, we sought to investigate whether cytokines are involved in the inter-Sertoli TJ assembly in vitro. Sertoli cells isolated from 20-day-old rats were cultured at a density of 0.5-1.2 × 10

77955951656	Organisational climate, organisational commitment and intention to leave amongst hospital nurses in Taiwan	Aims and objectives: To examine: (1) Taiwanese nurses' perceptions of organisational climate, levels of organisational commitment and intention to leave, as well as relationships between these three variables; (2) demographic differences in the levels of these variables; and (3) mediating effects of organisational commitment on the relationship between organisational climate and intention to leave. Background: Organisational climate is related to organisational commitment and affects nurses' performances and attitudes towards an organisation. Design: A cross-sectional, descriptive design. Method: Registered nurses working in eight hospitals in southern Taiwan for more than six months were recruited. Data were collected using the Litwin and Stringer's Organisational Climate Questionnaire, Organizational Commitment Questionnaire and a five-item scale measuring intention to leave. Questionnaires were distributed to 612 potential participants; 486 valid returned questionnaires were analysed. Results: The study's participants were generally satisfied with their hospital's climate and yet claimed low commitment to their organisation and, nevertheless, reported low intention to leave their job. Single nurses were more satisfied with their hospital's climate and were more committed to their hospital and had a lower intention to leave their job compared to married nurses. Nurses working in district hospitals perceived a better hospital climate and had a lower intention to leave than nurses working in teaching or regional hospitals. Staff nurses perceived a better organisational climate than did nurse managers. Organisational climate, organisational commitment and intention to leave were intercorrelated. Organisational climate had almost 60% indirect effect on organisational commitment related to intention to leave. Conclusions: Creating a good organisational climate may increase nurses' organisational commitment and, in turn, decrease their intention to leave. Relevance to clinical practice: To motivate nurses' positive organisational behaviours and to address their diverse needs, hospital administrators are encouraged to understand nurses' work-climate perceptions and to address nurses' varied demographic factors. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

77957958438	Maternal psychological well-being and salivary cortisol in late pregnancy and early post-partum	Maternal cortisol plays an important role in foetal development and is often used to measure stress. In addition to stress, prenatal and post-partum women experience a mix of positive and negative emotions. However, few studies have examined the relationship between cortisol and maternal psychological health or how these relationships change from the prenatal to the post-partum periods. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between maternal cortisol and stress, happiness, and depression components of psychological well-being, in late pregnancy and early post-partum. The study used a repeated measure design with 41 women; 21 women completed all data collections. As expected, maternal salivary cortisol increased from awakening to 30 minutes after awakening during pregnancy. Levels of salivary cortisol were lower at post-partum. Stress, happiness and depression were significantly correlated at both prenatal and post-partum measurements. Prenatal cortisol awakening response was correlated with happiness. Maternal psychological well-being and cortisol did not differ by parity, race or employment. Maternal cortisol could potentially serve as a biochemical marker of maternal psychological well-being. Interventions to decrease maternal stress may promote maternal psychological well-being. Longitudinal studies with larger sample and diverse ethnicities may increase our understanding of the role of cortisol in foetal and maternal health. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

0035962923	Cloning and characterization of zfBLP1, a Bcl-XL homologue from the zebrafish, Danio rerio	The importance of the Bcl-2 family proteins in normal vertebrate embryogenesis is being recognized; however, their regulatory mechanism is poorly understood. We report here the cloning and characterization of a novel zebrafish Bcl-2 family protein, zfBLP1. The zfBLP1 cDNA is 1942 nucleotides long, encoding a polypeptide of 238 amino acids. The primary sequence of zfBLP1 shares 50% identity to human Bcl-XL, and contains all four conserved BH domains of the Bcl-2 family proteins. Primary sequence analysis identified a consensus ER retention signal at the C-terminal end of zfBLP1. Northern blot analysis indicated that there were two major and two minor zfBLP1 mRNA species expressed during embryonic development. Among the two major mRNA species, the short one, approx. 3 kb in size, was expressed throughout embryonic development, while the long one, approx. 7 kb long, was not detectable until the gastrula stage. These results suggest that zfBLP1 is a novel Bcl-2 family protein under complicated regulations, and is likely to play an important role in zebrafish oogenesis and embryogenesis. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

0036319258	Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-4 (rhBMP-4) enhanced posterior spinal fusion without decortication	In posterior spinal fusion, insufficient decortication may decrease the number of bone marrow derived ostoprogenitor stem cells and affect the success of bony fusion. The finding of bone formation through interaction between rhBMP-4 and non-marrow derived mesenchymal cells constituted the basis of the current study. The aim is to investigate the possibility of molecular enhancement of posterior spinal fusion by site-specific application of rhBMP-4 with or without surgical decortication. Eighteen adult rabbits underwent single level bilateral posterior intertransverse process spinal fusion at L5-L6, one side with decortication, and the other side without decortication. Two animals underwent sham operation without bone grafts, the other 16 animals were randomly allocated into three groups, using hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate (HA-TCP) ceramic blocks augmented with 0, 0.125 and 0.5 mg of rhBMP-4 respectively. Spinal fusion morphology was evaluated with sequential X-ray, microradiography and histomorphology. At week 7, complete bony fusion was achieved in none of the groups without rhBMP-4 irrespective of whether the bony contact surface was decorticated or not. In the groups with low dose rhBMP-4, complete fusion occurred in two of six un-decorticated sites (33%) and in three of six (50%) decorticated sites. 100% complete fusion was found in the high dose rhBMP-4 group independent of surgical decortication. The dorsal cortices of the un-decorticated transverse processes were replaced by newly formed trabecular bone through biological remodeling. This study suggested that rhBMP-4 can induce non-marrow derived mesenchymal cells to differentiate into osteogenic cells and thus enhance the high success rate of posterior spinal fusion in both the decorticated and un-decorticated model. © 2002 Orthopaedic Research Society.

0037213267	Cellular distributions of creatine kinase in branchia of euryhaline tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus)	Although euryhaline teleosts can adapt to environmental fluctuation of salinity, their energy source for responding to changes in salinity and osmolarity remains unclear. This study examines the cellular localization of creatine kinase (CK) expression in branchia of tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). Western blot analysis of muscle-type CK (MM form) revealed a high association with salinity changes, but BB and MB forms of CK in the gills of fish adapted to seawater did not change. With the use of immunocytochemistry, three CK isoforms (MM, MB, and BB) were localized in mitochondria-rich (MR) cells and other epithelial cells of tilapia gills. In addition, staining intensity of MM-form CK in MR cells increased after seawater transfer, whereas BB and MB forms did not significantly change. To our knowledge, this work presents the first evidence of CK expression in MR cells of tilapia gills, highlighting the potential role of CK in providing energy for ion transport.

0037230154	The interplay of collagen IV, tumor necrosis factor-α, gelatinase B (matrix metalloprotease-9), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases-1 in the basal lamina regulates sertoli cell-tight junction dynamics in the rat testis	During spermatogenesis, preleptotene and leptotene spermatocytes must translocate across the blood-testis barrier formed by inter-Sertoli cell-tight junctions (TJs) from the basal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium adjacent to the basement membrane to the adluminal compartment at stages VIII-IX for further development. Because of the close proximity between extracellular matrix (ECM) that constitutes the basement membrane and the blood-testis barrier, we sought to investigate the role of ECM in Sertoli cell TJ dynamics. When Sertoli cells were cultured in vitro to initiate the assembly of the Sertoli cell TJ-permeability barrier, the presence of an anticollagen IV antibody indeed perturbed the barrier. Because ECM is known to maintain a pool of cytokines and TNFα has been shown to regulate TJ dynamics in other epithelia, we investigated whether TNFα can regulate Sertoli cell TJ function via its effects on collagen α3(IV) and other proteins that maintain the homeostasis of ECM. As expected, recombinant TNFα perturbed the Sertoli cell TJ-barrier assembly in vitro dose dependently. TNFα also inhibited the timely induction of occludin, which is known to associate with the Sertoli cell TJ-barrier assembly. Furthermore, TNFα induced the expression of Sertoli cell collagen α3(IV), gelatinase B (matrix metalloprotease-9, MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases-1 but not gelatinase A (matrix metalloprotease-2), and promoted the activation of pro-MMP-9. These results thus suggest that the activated MMP-9 induced by TNFα is used to cleave the existing collagen network in the ECM, thereby perturbing the TJ-barrier. This in turn creates a negative feedback that causes TNFα to induce collagen α3(IV) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases-1 expression so as to replenish the collagen network in the disrupted TJ-barrier and limit the activity of MMP-9. Taken collectively, these observations strengthen the notion that ECM is involved in the regulation of junction dynamics in addition to its structural role in the testis.

0037378623	Sertoli cell tight junction dynamics: Their regulation during spermatogenesis	During spermatogenesis, developing preleptotene and leptotene spermatocytes must translocate from the basal to the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium so that fully developed spermatids (spermatozoa) can be released to the tubular lumen at spermiation. It is conceivable that the opening and closing of the inter-Sertoli tight junctions (TJs) that constitute the blood-testis barrier are regulated by an array of intriguingly coordinated signaling pathways and molecules. Several molecules have been shown to regulate Sertoli cell TJ dynamics; they include, for example, transforming growth factor β3 (TGFβ3), occludin, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and signaling pathways such as the TGFβ3/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Yet the mechanisms that regulate these events are essentially not known. This minireview summarizes some of the recent advances in the study of TJ dynamics in the testis and reviews several models that can be used to study TJ dynamics. It also highlights specific areas for future research toward understanding the precise physiological relationship between junction dynamics and spermatogenesis.

0038299227	Fer kinase/FerT and adherens junction dynamics in the testis: An in vitro and in vivo study	Fer kinase is a 94-kDa cytoplasmic cell-cell actin-based adherens junction (AJ)-associated nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) found in multiple epithelia including the testis, whereas FerT kinase (51 kDa) is the truncated testis-specific form of Fer kinase, lacking the Fps/Fes/Fer/CIP4 (products of oncogenes identified in avian and feline sarcoma, encoding tyrosine protein kinases) and the three coiled-coil domains versus Fer kinase. Yet the role(s) of Fer kinase in AJ dynamics in the testis remains largely unexplored.

More recent studies have shown that TGF-β3 also regulates Sertoli cell tight junction (TJ) dynamics in vitro via the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, suggesting that this cytokine plays a crucial role in regulating the opening and closing of the blood-testis barrier (BTB). This in turn regulates the passage of pre-leptotene and leptotene spermatocytes across the BTB at stages VIII-XI of the seminiferous epithelial cycle. This review summarizes recent advances of studies on TGF-βs in the testis, highlighting their regulatory role in TJ dynamics.

Although the mechanism(s) that regulates AJ dynamics in the testis is virtually unknown, Rho GTPases have been implicated in the regulation of these events in other epithelia. Studies have shown that the in vitro assembly of the Sertoli-germ cell AJs but not of the Sertoli cell tight junctions (TJs) is associated with a transient but significant induction of RhoB. Immunohistochemistry has shown that the localization of RhoB in the seminiferous epithelium is stage specific, being lowest in stages VII-VIII prior to spermiation, and displays cell-specific association during the epithelial cycle. Throughout the cycle, RhoB was localized near the site of basal and apical ESs but was restricted to the periphery of the nuclei in elongating (but not elongated) spermatids, spermatocytes, and Sertoli cells. However, RhoB was not detected near the site of apical ESs at stages VII-VIII. Furthermore, disruption of AJs in Sertoli-germ cell cocultures either by hypotonic treatment or by treatment with 1(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-indazole-3-carbohydrazide (AF-2364) also induced RhoB expression. When adult rats were treated with AF-2364 to perturb Sertoli-germ cell AJs in vivo, a ∼4-fold induction in RhoB in the testis, but not in kidney and brain, was detected within 1 h, at least -1-4 days before germ cell loss from the epithelium could be detected by histological analysis. The signaling pathway(s) by which AF-2364 perturbed the Sertoligerm cell AJs apparently began with an initial activation of integrin, which in turn activated RhoB, ROCK1, (Rho-associated protein kinase 1, also called ROKβ), LIMK1 (LIM-kinase-1, also called lin-11 isl-1 mec3 kinase 1), and cofilin but not p140mDia and profilin via phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblots revealed that the induction of LIMK1 was mediated via an increase in its phospho-Ser but not phospho-Tyr content. Furthermore, Y-27632 ([(R)-(+)-trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexane-carboxamide, 2HCl]), a specific ROCK inhibitor, could effectively delay the AF-2364-induced germ cell loss from the seminiferous epithelium in vivo, illustrating that the integrin/RhoB/ROCK/LIMK pathway indeed plays a crucial role in the regulation of Sertoli-germ cell AJ dynamics. The fact that the RhoB pathway in the kidney and brain was not activated suggests that AF-2364 exerts its effects primarily at the testisspecific ES multiprotein complex structures between Sertoli cells and spermatids. In summary, this report illustrates that Sertoli germ cell AJ dynamics are regulated, at least in part, via the integrin/ROCK/LIMK/cofilin signaling pathway.

0038070531	Adhering junction dynamics in the testis are regulated by an interplay of β1-integrin and focal adhesion complex-associated proteins	During spermatogenesis, the movement of developing germ cells across the seminiferous epithelium associates with extensive restructuring of cell-cell actin-based adherens junctions (AJs), such as ectoplasmic specialization (ES, a testis-specific AJ junction), between Sertoli and germ cells. Although this event of germ cell movement is essential to the completion of spermatogenesis, the mechanism(s) that regulates AJ restructuring is largely unknown. Using Sertoli-germ cells cocultured in vitro to study the regulation of AJ assembly, it was shown that this event associated with a transient induction of β1-integrin, vinculin, p-FAK-Tyr

0038101584	Uniaxial phase transition in Si: Ab initio calculations	Based on a previously proposed thermodynamic analysis, [C. Cheng, W. H. Huang, and H. J. Li, Phys. Rev. B 63, 153202 (2001)] we study the relative stabilities of five Si phases under uniaxial compression using ab initio methods. The five phases are diamond, βSn, simple-hexagonal (sh), simple-cubic, and hexagonal closed-packed structures. The possible phase-transition patterns were investigated by considering the phase transitions between any two chosen phases of the five phases. By analyzing the different contributions to the relative phase stability, we identified the most important factors in reducing the phase-transition pressures at uniaxial compression. We also show that it is possible to have phase transitions occur only when the phases are under uniaxial compression, in spite of no phase transition when under hydrostatic compression. Taking all five phases into consideration, the phase diagram at uniaxial compression was constructed for pressures up to 20 GPa. The stable phases were found to be diamond, βSn, and sh structures, i.e., the same as those when under hydrostatic condition. According to the phase diagram, direct phase transition from the diamond to the sh phase is possible if the applied uniaxial pressures, on increasing, satisfy the condition P

0345168104	Effect of treadmill exercise on circulating thyroid hormone measurements	Objectives: Effects of exercise on circulating thyroid hormone (TH) values remain controversial. We sought to observe the effect of treadmill exercise on serum TH values in highly selected subjects. Methods: Twenty-six healthy male military recruits aged 23-27 (mean, 25) years were studied. All had maintained identical diet and physical activity for a week before the test. Serum samples were drawn before (baseline) and immediately, 1, 4, 24, 24 and 48 h after maximal exercise (on a treadmill, Bruce protocol). All subjects completed the protocol with normal ECG results. Specimens were analyzed to measure 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (T

0242500358	Transforming growth factor β3 regulates the dynamics of sertoli cell tight junctions via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway	Earlier studies have implicated the significance of transforming growth factor-β3 (TGFβ3) in the regulation of Sertoli cell tight junction (TJ) dynamics, possibly via its inhibitory effects on the expression of occludin, claudin-11, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Yet the mechanism by which TGFβ3 regulates the Sertoli cell TJ-permeability barrier is not known. Using techniques of semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and inhibitors against different kinases coupled with physiological techniques to assess the Sertoli cell TJ barrier function, it was shown that this TGFβ3-induced effect on Sertoli cell TJ dynamics is mediated via the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. First, the assembly of the Sertoli cellTJ barrier was shown to be associated with a transient but significant decline in both the TGFβ3 production and expression by Sertoli cells. Furthermore, addition of TGFβ3 to Sertoli cell cultures during TJ assembly indeed perturbed the TJ barrier with an IC

10944274006	A novel method for enabling the thermosonic wire bonding of gold wire onto chips with copper interconnects	The wire bonding of chips with copper interconnects is a challenging issue. The present study develops a method in which the substrates are stored in a temperature and humidity controlled environment such that copper oxide films of appropriate thickness are formed on the substrate prior to the gold-copper thermosonic bonding process. It is shown that this film can be removed during the bonding process, hence rendering the wire bonding process feasible without the requirement for an inert gas environment or the use of metallic cap layers. © 2004 The Electrochemical Society.

11144257103	Hydromagnetic condensate flow on horizontal wavy disks	This work carries out the modelling and simulation for the behavior of hydromagnetic condensate flow along a wavy disk. Mathematical analysis is used to obtain the dimensionless governing equations and boundary conditions, and the cubic spline collocation method is then used to calculate the flow and heat transfer characteristics along the wavy disk. The effects of the important parameters, such as Hartmann numbers, condensation parameters, and amplitude-wavelength ratios, on the flow and heat transfer characteristics are carefully examined. The mathematical analysis and numerical procedure described here can be applied to wavy surface heat transfer and flow problems.

12244301211	Rho GTPases and spermatogenesis	Rho GTPases, such as Rho, Rac and Cdc42, are known to regulate many cellular processes including cell movement and cell adhesion. While the cellular events of germ cell movement are crucial to spermatogenesis since developing germ cells must migrate progressively from the basal to the adluminal compartment but remain attached to the seminiferous epithelium, the physiological significance of Rho GTPases in spermatogenesis remains largely unexplored. This paper reviews some recent findings on Rho GTPases in the field with emphasis on the studies in the testis, upon which future studies can be designed to delineate the role of Rho GTPases in spermatogenesis. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

12344251958	Thermal efficiency optimization of an irreversible Brayton heat engine with variable heat reservoir temperatures	This work presents a finite-time thermodynamic analysis for the maximum thermal efficiency of an irreversible Brayton heat engine coupled with two variable-temperature heat reservoirs. The thermal efficiency is optimized about the adiabatic temperature ratio and the heat exchanger thermal conductance ratio. Effects of total thermal conductances of heat exchangers, ratios of cold and hot fluid thermal capacitance rates, ratios of working and hot fluid thermal capacitance rates, turbine and compressor isentropic efficiencies, and heat reservoir temperature ratios on the maximum thermal efficiency and its corresponding parameters are studied. Results for the optimum values of adiabatic temperature ratios and heat exchanger thermal conductance ratios are presented. The thermal capacitance rate of the cold external fluid should be larger than that of the hot external fluid to raise the maximum thermal efficiency and its corresponding power output. Furthermore, decreasing the ratio of working and hot fluid thermal capacitance rates tends to increase the maximum thermal efficiency.
