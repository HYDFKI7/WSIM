84929399803	Progress of solid self-lubricating coating overa wide range of temperature	Lubricants which have a low friction coefficient and wear rate not only at high temperature but also from room temperature to high temperature are required by rapidly developing national defence, aircraft and thermonuclear industries. Therefore, it is of great significance to research and develop coatings/cladding with anti-friction and wear-resisting performance over a wide range of temperature. On the basis of consulting a large number of references, structure design and tribological performance of self-lubricating coatings/cladding were summarized, and the development tendency of self-lubricating coatings/cladding over a wide range of temperature was put forward.

1442357986	Friction and wear properties of bronze-graphite composite under water lubrication	Bronze-graphite composite was prepared using powder metallurgy. The friction and wear behaviors of the resulting composites in dry- and water-lubricated sliding against a stainless steel were comparatively investigated on an MM-200 friction and wear tester in a ring-on-block contact configuration. The wear mechanisms of the bronze-graphite composite were discussed based on examination of the worn surface morphologies of both the composite block and the stainless steel ring by means of scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersion spectrometry and on determination of some typical elements on the worn surfaces by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that the friction coefficient was higher under water lubrication than that under dry sliding and it showed margined change with increasing load under the both sliding conditions. A considerably decreased wear rate of the bronze-graphite composite was registered under water-lubricated sliding than under dry sliding, though it rose significantly at a relatively higher load. This was attributed to the hindered transfer of the composite onto the counterpart steel surface under water-lubricated sliding and the cooling effect of the water as a lubricant, while its stronger transfer onto the steel surface accounted for its higher wear rate under dry sliding. Thus, the bronze-graphite composite with much better wear-resistance under water-lubricated sliding than under dry sliding against the stainless steel could be a potential candidate as the tribo-material in aqueous environment. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

14744282691	Effect of matching materials on the tribological properties of amorphous hydrogenated carbon film	Amorphous hydrogenated carbon (a-C:H) films were deposited on Si substrate using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique. The microstructure and morphology of the resulting films were investigated by means of Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The tribological properties of the a-C:H films sliding against various matching materials in a ball-on-disc configuration were investigated on a UMT-2MT test rig. The wear tracks of the films and of the counterparts were observed on a JSM-5600LV scanning electron microscope and were analyzed using a KEVEX energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope. It was found that the a-C:H films produced by PECVD were smooth and compact, with the nanohardness to be about 15.2 GPa. The films were characterized by severe abrasive and adhesive wear as they slid against the soft counterparts such as Cu and steel, which corresponded to a relatively high and unstable friction coefficient. The films were dominated by slight peel-off and scratch as they slid against the hard counterparts such as Al

16644397051	Tribological properties of carbon fiber reinforced peek composites under water lubrication	The tribological behavior of carbon fiber and polytetrafluoroethylene reinforced polyetheretherketone composites were comparatively evaluated under dry and water lubricated sliding. The wear mechanisms of PEEK composite were discussed as well. The result indicates that water can reduce the wear rate of PEEK composite. The wear rates of composite show much lower under water lubrication than under dry sliding, owing to the boundary lubrication effect of the water-adsorbed layer and the cooling effect of water. The wear of PEEK composites are characterized by adhesion and abrasive under dry sliding. Contrary to the above, a small amount of exposed and locally polished fibers are observed on the worn composite surface under water lubrication. In this case the micro-scuffing is seen. The thin coherent and compact transfer film on the counterpart stainless steel formed under dry sliding is markedly prevented under water lubrication.

The effect of RF power on the surface morphology, microstructure, hardness and Young's modulus of DLC films was investigated by atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy and nano-indentation.

18144394329	Comparative investigation on the wear and transfer behaviors of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites under dry sliding and water lubrication	The wear and transfer characteristics of four carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites under distilled-water-lubricated and dry-sliding against stainless steel were comparatively investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was utilized to examine composite microstructures and modes of failure. The typical element chemical states of the transfer film on the stainless steel were examined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is found that all the composites hold the lowered friction coefficient and showed much better wear resistance under water lubricated sliding against stainless steel than that under dry sliding. The worn of composites were characterized by plastic deformation, scuffing, micro-cracking, and spalling under both dry- and water lubricated conditions. Such plastic deformation, scuffing, micro-cracking, and spalling, however, are significantly abated under water-lubricated condition. XPS analysis conformed to that the transfer of composites onto the counterpart ring surface is significantly hindered under water lubrication. The transfer film had smaller effect on the tribological behavior of composites under water lubricated condition than that under dry sliding, because under water-lubricated condition the cooling and boundary lubricating effects of the water medium dominated the tribological behavior. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

1942541186	Tribological behavior of filled polyetheretherketone composites in sliding against stainless steel under water lubrication	Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) composites filled with graphite, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and carbon fiber (CF) were prepared by compression molding. The tribological behavior of the resulting filled PEEK composites in sliding against 316 stainless steel under water lubrication was investigated on an MM-200 friction and wear tester in a ring-on-block contact configuration. The worn surfaces of the PEEK composite and the counterpart stainless steel and the wear debris of the PEEK composite were examined by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) attachment. It was found that at a fixed mass fraction of 5% for the fillers of graphite and PTFE, the friction and wear behaviors of the PEEK composite were closely dependent on the mass fraction of the carbon fiber (CF). The PEEK composite containing 15%CF showed much better wear-resistance than the one containing 5% CF. This was attributed to the reinforcing effect of the carbon fiber with high hardness and mechanical strength. Moreover, the friction and wear behaviors of the PEEK composite were also greatly dependent on the load applied. A considerably increased wear rate of the PEEK composite was registered at 700 N, which indicated that the composite under-water-lubricated sliding against stainless steel was not suitable to high load applications. The different friction and wear behaviors of the PEEK composites with different CF mass fractions or at different loads were related to their different worn surfaces and wear debris morphologies. Moreover, the energy dispersive X-ray analysis result indicated that the counterpart stainless steel transferred onto the worn surface of the PEEK composite, which demonstrated that it could be critical to select materials applicable to water-lubricated sliding.

18744405383	Microstructure and wear behavior of nickel-based nanocoatings prepared by electro-brush plating	Nickel-based nanocoatings were prepared on AISI-1045 steel sheet by electro-brush plating. The average grain size and microstructure of the nickel nanocoatings heated at different temperatures for 2 h were examined by means of X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. The microhardness and wear behavior of the nanocoatings were investigated. The worn surface morphologies of the nanocoatings were observed using a scanning electron microscope. It was found that the average grain size, the hardness, and wear-resistance of the Ni-based nanocoatings were greatly dependent on the heat treatment temperature. Namely, the heat treatment at a proper temperature led to a decrease in the grain size of the Ni-based nanocoatings, while the hardness and wear-resistance of the nanocoatings were greatly increased after the heat treatment. This led to a change in the wear mechanisms of the untreated and heat-treated nanocoatings as well. In other words, the untreated Ni-based electro-brush plating coating was dominated by severe adhesion wear and scuffing, while the coating heated at 300°C for 2 h was dominated by brittle cracking. Moreover, the Ni-based electro-brush plated coating heated at 300°C for 2 h had an average grain size below 30 nm and the largest hardness, while the nanocoating heated at 200°C for 2 h had the best wear-resistance. The increased hardness and wear-resistance of the Ni-based electro-brush plated coating were attributed to the decreasing in the grain size and increase in the compactness of the coating after proper heat treatment.

1942477320	Protection of ablative adhesion and erosion of slide track of missile launcher by high-temperature two-phase exhaust using MoS2-based bonded solid lubricant film	The ablative adhesion and erosion of high temperature (2000-3000°C) and ultra-high speed (>5 Ma) two-phase exhaust on the slide track surface of a missile launcher, together with the corrosive action of the ablation residue on the slide track surface in the humid and salt mist environment, account for the breakdown and the decreased service life of the launcher. Thus it is imperative to ensure the requirement for war readiness and logistics by applying effective lubrication and protection treatment to the weapon launching system. Accordingly, various molybdenum disulfide-based bonded solid lubricant films were investigated for such protective purposes. The causes and features of the ablation and corrosion by the exhaust and ablation-adhesion residue were discussed as well. The results of a series of environmental condition tests and simulating tests on an engine bench tester indicated that the ablation and corrosion degree of the slide track of the missile launcher was dependent on the engine type and the type and amount of the detonative agent, while it was effectively abated by coating the slide track surface with various MoS

2542643888	Comparative study of tribological behavior of carbon fiber reinforced polytetrafluoroethylene composites at dry- and water-lubricated sliding against stainless steel	Carbon fiber reinforced polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) composite was prepared by compression molding. The friction and wear behaviors of the resulting carbon fiber reinforced PTFE composite sliding against stainless steel at dry-and water-lubricated conditions were comparatively evaluated on an MM-200 test rig in a block-on-ring configuration. The morphologies of the worn surfaces of the PTFE composite and counterpart steel were observed on a scanning electron microscope, while the chemical state of F on the worn surface of the steel sliding against the PTFE composite at dry- and water-lubricated conditions was examined by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that the incorporation of the carbon fiber contributed to great increase of the wear resistance of PTFE, while the water as the lubricant further significantly increased the wear resistance of PTFE and its reinforced composite. This was attributed to the load-carrying capacity of the carbon fiber and the cooling and lubricating action of the water, which considerably decreased the friction-induced heat and hence hindered the plastic deformation and breakage of the PTFE matrix by the thermal effect. The PTFE composite was characterized by severe plastic deformation, adhesion and fatigue, as it slid against the stainless steel at dry condition, while the plastic deformation and adhesion were greatly hindered under water lubrication.

27744506800	Tribological behavior of POLY (phenylene sulphide) coating and carbon fiber reinforced composites coating under dry sliding and water lubrication	PPS coating and carbon fiber reinforced PPS composite coating were prepared on AISI1045 steel substrate by flame spraying. Microstructure and morphology of coalescent with substrate of coating were studied with FTIR and SEM. Friction and wear characteristics of PPS coating and carbon fiber reinforced PPS composite coating under water and dry sliding against stainless steel were comparatively investigated using a block-ring tester. Worn surface of composite coating and counterpart steel ring were investigated using SEM. Typical elements on the counterpart steel ring were analyzed by XPS. In dry sliding friction of carbon reinforced PPS composite coating exhibited lower friction coefficient and higher wear rate than pure PPS coating did. But under water lubrication PPS composite coating exhibited excellent tribological performance with lower friction and wear rate in comparison with pure PPS coating. Under water lubrication, water play the role of cooling and washing, so transfer film had smaller effect on the tribological behavior of composite coating than under dry sliding. Wear mechanism of composite coating under dry sliding and water lubrication is different.

It was found that the PEEK composite had much better wear-resistance under water-lubricated sliding against stainless steel than under dry-sliding. The transfer film had smaller effect on the tribological behavior of PEEK composite under water-lubricated condition than under dry-sliding, because under water-lubricated condition the cooling and boundary lubricating effects of the water medium dominated the tribological behavior. Moreover, the considerably hindered transfer of the PEEK composite under water lubrication might also account for the decreased wear rate under water lubrication. The PEEK composite was characterized by mild scuffing and fiber protruding under water lubrication, while the plastic deformation and adhesion was significantly abated than under dry-sliding. © 2004 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

30844453375	Tribological behavior of the carbon fiber reinforced polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) composite coating under dry sliding and water lubrication	Carbon fiber reinforced polyphenylene sulphide (PPS) composite coatings (the mass fraction of the carbon fiber varied from 1 to 5 wt%) were prepared by flame spraying. The microstructure and physical properties of the composite coating were studied. The friction and wear characteristics of the PPS coating and carbon fiber reinforced PPS composite coating under dry- and water-lubricated sliding against stainless steel were comparatively investigated using a block-ring tester. The composite coatings showed lower friction coefficient and higher wear rate than pure PPS coatings under dry sliding. Under water-lubricated condition, the composite coatings showed better wear resistance than under dry. Under water-lubricated condition the tribological behaviors of the 3 wt% carbon fiber reinforced composite coating also were investigated under different sliding speed and load. The result showed that the sliding speed had little effect on the tribological properties, but the load affected greatly on that of the composite coatings. The morphologies of the worn surfaces of the composite coatings and the counterpart steel were analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) for compositional analysis. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The worn surface morphology of the steel ball was observed on a scanning electron microscope (SEM), while the chemical states of some typical elements on the worn surface of DLC film were investigated by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The result showed that the DLC film recorded continuously increased friction coefficient and wear rate with increasing relative humidity from 5% to 100%. In dry nitrogen (RH < 5%), thick and compact transferred carbon-rich layer was observed covering on the worn surface of steel ball, while the chemical states of the original and worn film surface showed no obvious change. In humid nitrogen, distinct changes of the chemical states on the worn surface of DLC film took place, indicating that tribochemical reactions such as the oxidation of DLC film and the interactions between DLC film and steel ball were involved in the friction process. Therefore, it was proposed that the friction and wear behaviors of DLC film were dependent on the friction-induced physical and chemical interactions among DLC film, steel ball and water and/or oxygen molecules. The roles of environment in the friction and wear behaviors of DLC film were discussed in terms of the friction-induced physical and chemical interactions. © 2005.

The average grain size and microstructure of the nickel nanocoatings heated at different temperature for 2 h and Ni/carbon nanotube composite nanocoatings were examined by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), and their wear behaviour and microhardness were investigated. The average grain size of the nickel nanocoatings are greatly affected by heating treatment temperature, whereas the average grain size of the Ni/carbon nanotube composite nanocoatings are mainly controlled by carbon nanotube content in electrolyte. The wear behaviour and microhardness of the nanocoatings is closely related to the average grain sizes and microstructures of the nanocoatings. The excellent antiwear and mechanics properties of the nanocoatings are due to the small grains and compact microstructures of the nanocoatings caused by heating treatment temperature and carbon nanotube used as a preventing agent.

The major causes of corrosion were analyzed, and corrosion prevention by surface-modification of the igniters and various coatings and paints was investigated.

The results indicate that average grain size and microstructure of the Ni/carbon nanotube composite nanocoatings are mainly controlled by carbon nanotube content in electrolyte. The Ni/carbon nanotube composite nanocoating has an average grain size of about 16 nm as the carbon nanotube content in electrolyte is 4 wt%. The wear behaviour and microhardness of the Ni/carbon nanotube composite nanocoatings is closely related to the average grain sizes and microstructures of the Ni/carbon nanotube composite nanocoatings.

Thus the flowing fields of the rocket engine exhaust flame were analyzed by means of numerical simulation. The effectiveness of various organic resin coatings and ceramic coating in preventing the ablation of the actuator was investigated based on the simulation tests, rocket engine bench test, and field trial launch test. The temperature changes of the inner wall of the coated actuator during the field launch test were monitored using a data remote-sensing system and compared to that by numerical calculation. It was found that the flowing fields of the rocket engine exhaust flame could be readily analyzed using the numerical simulation method. The phenolic resin and silicone coatings had excellent ability to prevent the actuator from overheating and ablation. Specifically, the silicone coating of a thickness about 0.5 mm was able to keep the temperature on the inner wall of the actuator during the field launch test below 70 °C and hence could be suggested as the first choice to acquire satisfactory ablation and erosion protection of the actuator. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The mechanical properties of the composites with different fiber contents were evaluated. The friction and wear properties of the polyimide and its composites were investigated under dry-sliding and water-lubricated conditions. The results indicated that the short-carbon-fiber-reinforced polyimide composites had better tensile and flexural strengths and improved tribological properties in comparison with glass-fiber- and quartz-fiber- reinforced polyimide composites. The incorporation of short carbon fibers into the polyimide contributed to decreases in the friction coefficient and wear rate under both dry and water-lubricated conditions and especially under water lubrication because of the boundary lubrication effect of water. The polyimide and its composites were characterized by plastic deformation, microcracking, and spalling under both dry and water-lubricated conditions, which were significantly abated under the water-lubricated condition. The glass and quartz fibers were easily abraded and broken; the broken fibers transferred to the mating metal surface and increased the surface roughness of mating stainless steel, which led to the wear rate increasing for the glass-fiber- and quartzfiber-reinforced polyimide composites. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84861460687	The structure and properties of CrAlN films deposited by mid-frequency unbalanced magnetron sputtering at different substrate bias duty cycles	The CrAlN films were deposited on silicon and stainless steel substrates by mid-frequency unbalanced magnetron sputtering system. The influence of duty cycle on composition, structure, morphology and properties of the CrAlN films were investigated. The results showed that the CrAlN films presented NaCl-type crystal structure, indicating that the crystalline structures of the CrAlN films were predominantly cubic as that of CrN. Meanwhile, the Al and N concentration, grain size and surface roughness declined with the increase of the duty cycle. The cross section of the films changed from random porous to fine continuous column structure with duty cycle varied from 50% to 80%. The internal stress was changed to the compressive stress and declined with the increase of the duty cycle. The behavior of the incremental hardness as the duty cycle increased was also investigated. In addition, the oxidation resistance of the films deposited at different duty cycle was evaluated after annealed in air at 500-900°C. The extent of oxidation and the oxidizing state of the element were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscope and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques. The results showed that the thermal stability of the film was influenced by the composition and the microstructure of the film. It was found that the film deposited at 70% had the best oxidation resistance compared with other films, where the ratio of O/N kept still about the 35.22% after annealed at 700°C. However, the hardness of the film was significantly decreased as the heat-treatment temperature increases, which was attributed to the formation of amorphous oxides and θ-Al

The morphologies of the worn surface and the transfer films of bonded graphite solid lubricating coatings in opposite parts was studied. The results show that the wear rate of bonded graphite solid lubricating coating decreases with the increase of velocity and load, whereas the friction coefficient decreases with the increase of load, and increases slowly with the increase of velocity. The high load and velocity can promote the formation of the fine transfer films in opposite parts under fretting friction condition, so the bonded graphite solid lubricating coatings show high load-bearing capacity, fine antifriction and antiwear properties.

The friction and wear properties of the coatings sliding against silicon nitride ceramic ball and stainless steel ball under dry condition were investigated using an SRV friction and wear tester. As slid against the ceramic and stainless steel counterparts under the same conditions, the results show that the two types of plasma sprayed WC-12%Co coatings exhibited minor differences in friction coefficients and wear mechanism. Both nanostructured and microstructure coatings were dominated by slight micro-cracking and abrasive wear at relatively lower load, while they were characterized by severe abrasive wear and brittle fracture at relatively larger load. However, the nanostructured coating experienced less worn surface damage and showed much better wear resistance than the conventional one under the same testing condition. This could be largely attributed to the more compact microstructure and higher microhardness, cohesion, and adhesion to substrate of the nanostructured WC-12%Co coating as compared with the conventional coating.

The effects of pulse duty cycle on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the resultant films were investigated by means of high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Raman spectroscopy, nanoindentation, and stress measurement. The low pulse duty cycle was found the key in the formation of fullerenelike structure in hydrogenated carbon films, and thus increased the hardness, elasticity, and internal stress of the films.

It was found that the UV irradiation had little effects on the chemical composition and surface morphology of both the films, but greatly influenced their tribological properties in the opposite trends. This result was attributed to the different changing outcomes of the bonding configuration induced by the UV actions of primary photo-dissociation and secondary recombination, wherein the inherent bonding configuration and internal stress played important roles. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The PA1010 powder as the raw material and its flame-sprayed coating on the steel were analyzed by means of Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, while their thermal degradation and oxidation behaviors were comparatively investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry. The friction and wear behaviors of the resulting PA1010 coating sliding against stainless steel in a block-on-ring configuration were examined by MM-200 friction and wear tester. The morphologies of the worn coating surface and the counterpart steel ring were observed on a scanning electron microscope. It was found that the PA1010 powder does not experience degradation and oxidation during the flame spraying process. The flame-sprayed PA1010 coating has a larger crystallinity than the PA1010 powder, which contributes to increase the wear-resistance of the coating. The friction and wear behaviors of the PA1010 coating are closely dependent on the applied normal load, which is attributed to the significant effect of the normal load on the transfer of the PA1010 onto the counterpart surface and its transfer-film-formation thereon.

70349171811	Synthesis and fluorescence properties of rare earth complexes with a new diamide ligand	The study of the rare earth complexes has been an active research area, which may be attributed to the specific spectroscopic and magnetic properties of rare earth ions and the abundance of rare earth elements in our country. Amide-type ligands which are flexible in structure and have 'terminal-group effects' , will shield the encapsulated rare earth ion from interaction with the surroundings effectively, and thus achieve strong luminescent properties. Aiming at good fluorescent rare earth complexes, a new diamide ligand 1, 4-bis[(2'-benzylaminoformyl)phenoxyl-decatyl-oxy] benzene (L) and its Sm(III) , Eu(III) and Tb(III) complexes were synthesized for the first time.

76549106808	Mechanical and tribological properties of titanium reinforced polybenzimidazole	Polybenzimidazole (PBI) was synthesized by liquid condensation and its molecular weight was measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The resulting PBI product was used as the polymer matrix to prepare composites reinforced with titanium (abridged as Ti/PBI) using hot-press sintering in vacuum. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the morphology of the composite samples, while a ball-on-disc friction and wear tester were performed to evaluate tribological properties of the bulk PBI composites. The introduction of Ti as the reinforcing agent contributed to improving the mechanical properties of the PBI composites. Moreover, the Ti/PBI composites had small friction coefficients as slid against AISI-1045 steel in a ball-on-disc configuration, and the friction coefficients decreased with increasing temperature. However, the wear resistance of PBI was reduced slightly by incorporation of the Ti powders, and increased wear rates were recorded for Ti/PBI composites at elevated temperatures. © 2009 IMechE.

Our simulations show that both graphitization temperature and dehydrogenization temperature decrease with H fraction in the films, which is in good agreement with the available experimental data. The dehydrogenization temperature is found to be much higher than the graphitization temperature.

Our simulations show that the film growth at low incident energy (1 eV) is dominated by the adsorption of H and C atoms. At moderate incident energy (10 and 20eV), the abstraction reaction of incident H atoms with H atoms adsorbed at the surface becomes important. At high incident energy (30 and 40 eV), the a-C:H film growth is a two-step process: one is the adsorption and the shallow implantation of C atoms, and the other is the deep implantation of H atoms. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

Microstructure and phase composition of the plasma-sprayed mullite coatings were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction.

We regulate the solution-immersion process by changing the immersion time, the growing temperature, and the solution compositions to control different topographies of CuO surfaces. The as-prepared superhydrophobic surfaces possess tunable water adhesion that ranges from extremely low to very high, on which the sliding angle is 3 ± 1, 12 ± 1, 28 ± 2, 39 ± 2, and 90° (the water droplet is firmly pinned on the superhydrophobic surface without any movement at any tilted angles), respectively.

After annealed at different temperatures, structure, composition and properties of a-C:H films were investigated via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS), 3D surface profiler and ball-on-disk tribotester. Compared with the as-deposited film, the a-C:H film annealed at low temperature of 300°C exhibits similar structure, with internal decreasing stress and notably improved tribological property. Comparatively, at elevated temperatures of 400°C and 500°C, the annealed films present severe graphitization and oxidation, contributing to the deterioration of the tribological properties or even complete failure. Thus, the annealing temperature plays a significant role on the structure, composition and properties of a-C:H films.

SAMs were characterized by ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. The nano-tribological properties and micro-tribological properties were tested. Results showed that fatty acids (C18 and C12) were inserted successfully to the blank of PAMAM molecule in PAMAM SAMs. As a result, the friction force and friction coefficients of composite SAMs were decreased while the load-carrying capacity of the composite films was increased. The difference in molecular length of C18 and C12 fatty acids did not produce obvious difference in friction coefficients and load-carrying capacity.

0036045961	Comparative investigation of the tribological behavior and wear mechanism of bronze-graphite composite under dry-and water-lubricated sliding against steel	The friction and wear behavior of the bronze-graphite composite under the dry-and water-lubricated sliding against a stainless steel was comparatively investigated with an MM-200 friction and wear tester. The wear mechanism of the composite was examined as well based on scanning electron microscopic and X-ray photoelectron spectrometric analyses of the worn surfaces of the composite and its counterpart. The results show that the composite shows lower wear rate and higher friction coefficient under the water lubrication at a relatively smaller sliding speed. Little difference in the friction coefficient and wear rate is observed for the composite under both dry-and water-lubricated conditions as it slides against the steel at a relatively higher sliding speed. The composite is characterized by adhesion wear and scuffing under dry sliding, while it is characterized by abrasion and fatigue under water-lubricated sliding. The cooling effect of water can abate the surface temperature rise and restrain the adhesion and transfer. This makes a great contribution to the decrease of the wear rate. Though the oxidation of the counterpart steel is enhanced by using water as the lubricant medium, the resultant generation of a compact oxide film can restrain the adhesion and transfer and hence reduce the wear rate of the frictional pair.

The surface area ratio of the embedded phase was 39.1%. The tribological behavior of the embedded composites was evaluated under dry friction and lubricated with a bonded solid lubricating film outer-layer on a reciprocating friction and wear tester at ambient conditions. The morphologies of the worn surfaces and of the transfer films on the counterpart surfaces were observed with a scanning electron microscope. The tribological behavior of the embedded composites was highly dependent on the hardness of the embedding materials. Friction and wear of A1 alloy can be drastically reduced by proper embedding, but embedding with solid lubricants such as graphite and PTFE does not help. Friction and wear behaviors were different in sliding against A1 and plain carbon steel. The observation of the worn composite surfaces by SEM indicates that wear of A1-based composite blocks is characterized by plowing, severe adhesion, and plastic deformation. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The tribological behavior of the modified polyetheretherketone composite in sliding against the stainless steel under the water lubrication was investigated under a wide range of load. The profiles of worn surfaces and wear debris were observed with a scanning electron microscope. It was found that an increase in the testing load resulted in the slow and steady rise of the wear rate and the decrease of the friction coefficient at the beginning. However, when the testing load exceeded 700 N, the wear rate rose drastically and the friction coefficient also rose. The modified PEEK composite was characterized by fatigue wear at a relatively small load and by serious micro-cutting and plastic deformation at a heavier load.

The influence of the substrate bias voltage on the structural and the mechanical properties of the films were investigated. It is observed that there are two clear regions: (1) below -300 V, and (2) above -300 V. For the former region, the (1 1 1) texture is dominated as the substrate bias voltage is increased to -200 V. The lattice parameter is smaller than that of CrN reported in the ICSD standard (4.140 ) and the as-deposited films exhibit tensile stress. Meanwhile, the surface roughness decreases and the N concentration show a slow increase. For the latter region, the (2 0 0)-oriented structure is formed. However, the lattice parameter is larger as compared with the value reported in the ICSD standard, and the surface roughness increases and the N concentration decreases obviously. In this case, the compressive stress is obtained. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The ZnO nanorods with various densities have been fabricated by controlling the synthesis temperature and time.

The as-prepared superhydrophobic ZnO surface allows water droplets to pin on the surface without any movement, even if it is tilted to a vertical position or turned upside down. Furthermore, the adhesive force of the surface is found to be strong enough to catch a water droplet that rolls down quickly from a tilted low adhesive superhydrophobic surface. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Results revealed that the as remelted coating possessed a denser microstructure with pore and crack free and a higher microhardness than the as sprayed coating. At the same time, fiction and wear tests indicated the laser remelted coating exhibited a better wear resistance than the plasma sprayed coating from room temperature to 600°C, while the wear resistance of the former was inferior to that of the latter at elevated temperature of above 600°C.

The tribological properties were evaluated using a reciprocal ball-on-disc test rig and a lateral force microscope. Results of XPS show the existence of Cu(0) and PAMAM molecule on the surface of the film. Compared with the self-assembled monolayer of the poly(amide amine) generation 4.0 dendrimer, the friction force of PAMAM/Cu film is lower and the friction coefficient is smaller which can be attributed to the existence of Cu nanoparticles. The PAMAM/Cu film shows a good lubrication effect. The stability of friction and wear resistance of film is improved. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Superhydrophobic surfaces are conventionally prepared employing two steps: roughening a surface and lowering its surface energy. The fabrication of superhydrophobic cupric stearate surface is reported using a one-step process by immersing a zinc plate coated with copper into the stearic acid solution, simplifying the complexity of two different steps involved in the conventional methods. The surface of the zinc plate coated with copper is found to be covered with low surface energy cupric stearate film providing the water contact angle of 160 ± 1° with the rolling off properties. In addition, the damaged superhydrophobic surface can restore superhydrophobicity property by immersing the surface into the stearic acid solution again. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effect of WC-Ni doping on the microstructure and tribological properties of the conventional NiCrBSi coating were systematically investigated. It has been found that the microhardness and wear resistance of the Ni-based alloy coatings are greatly increased after adding the WC-Ni particles, due to the formation of hard WC phase and a partial dissolution of WC particles on the Ni matrix after laser cladding.

The effects of laser cladding parameters on the microstructure and friction and wear behavior of the NiAl coatings were investigated. It has been found that laser power density had a crucial influence on the microstructure and friction and wear behavior of NiAl coatings. Namely, the NiAl coatings synthesized under a lower power density have more dense and fine microstructure, and lower friction coefficient and wear rate.

The influence of substrate bias on deposition rate, composition, structure, morphology and properties of the CrAlN films was investigated. The results showed that, with the increase of the substrate bias voltage, the deposition rate decreased accompanied by a change of the preferred orientation of the CrAlN film from (2 2 0) to (2 0 0). The grain size and the average surface roughness of the CrAlN films declined as the bias voltage increases above -100 V. The morphology of the films changed from obviously columnar to dense glass-like structure with the increase of the bias voltage from -50 to -250 V. Meanwhile, the films deposited at moderate bias voltage had better mechanical and tribological properties, while the films deposited at higher bias voltage showed better corrosion resistance. It was found that the corrosion resistance improvement was not only attributed to the low pinhole density of the film, but also to chemical composition of films. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84862816771	Friction and wear properties of graphite-like carbon films deposited on different substrates with a different interlayer under high hertzian contact stress	Four types of graphite-like carbon (GLC) films were deposited on different substrates (Ti6Al4V, WC- 27CrNi) with a different interlayer (TiC/Ti, TiC/Ti/TiN) using an unbalanced magnetron sputtering system. The effect of substrate and interlayer on the microstructure and properties of the studied GLC films was then investigated using different characterization techniques. The results show that both the substrate and interlayer had an obvious influence on the tribological properties of the studied GLC films even though there was no significant structural difference between these films. Specifically, a substrate with a high hardness was propitious to achieving superior tribological behaviors for carbon film even with a different interlayer. However, the interlayer had a distinct influence on the tribological properties of the carbon film deposited on different substrates, and this effect varied with the hardness property of the substrate. For a hard substrate, the wear rate and wear life were similar irrespective of the interlayer. For a soft substrate, the addition of a TiN interlayer improved the wear life sevenfold compared to the film with only a TiC/Ti interlayer, but the wear rate for a film with and without a TiN interlayer was approximately the same. The obvious discrepancy between wear life and wear rate for a carbon film deposited on soft substrate was closely related with the film adhesion strength and plastic deformation of the substrate materials. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the wear life is a better parameter than wear rate in terms of characterization of the wear resistance of carbon film once the applied load causes the plastic deformation of the substrate. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

The worn surface morphologies of the composites under dry sliding and water-lubricated conditions were comparatively investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy, and the effect of various inorganic fillers on the friction and wear behavior of PTFE was discussed as well. The result indicated that metal oxide filled PTFE-based composites in sliding against stainless steel had smaller friction coefficients and larger wear rates under water lubrication than under dry sliding. Under water lubrication, the metal oxides filled PTFE composites registered larger friction coefficients and wear rates than pure PTFE. The high wear rate of the metal oxides filled PTFE composites could be attributed to the wetting action of the water as the lubricant of filler, which subsequently weakened the linkage between the polymer matrix and the inorganic filler and hence reduced the wear-resistance of the metal oxides filled PTFE composites. The significantly high wear rates of the PTFE composites filled with inorganic salts might be attributed to the solving of the filler in water, which weakened the link between the filler and the polymer matrix and hence decreased the wear-resistance of the composites.

The microstructure, morphology, contact angle, and tribological properties of the resultant carbon films were subsequently investigated by means of different characterization techniques. Raman analysis shows that the resultant amorphous carbon films are dominated by sp2 sites, and the intensity ratio of the D and G peaks increases gradually from ∼4.1 to ∼5.4 with decrease in the sputtering current from 16 to 4-A, which is one order of magnitude larger than that of diamond-like carbon films with high sp3 content, indicating a more graphite-like structure. The surface of the resulting carbon films is composed of granular structure with different diameters and heights, and the root mean square roughness of the studied films monotonically increases from 3.5-nm at a sputtering current of 4-A to 8.2-nm at 16-A. The contact angle of graphite-like carbon films with water changes from 43.4° to 89.5° with decrease in the sputtering current. Besides, these graphite-like carbon films demonstrate superior tribological properties with high load-bearing capacity and low friction coefficient in humid atmosphere.

The fretting wear behaviors of the two types of coatings were investigated in relation to their phase composition. The damage mechanisms of the coatings were identified by analysing their worn surfaces using scanning electron microscopy and three-dimensional non-contact surface profiler. A discussion about the identified fretting damage mechanisms was carried out. Results show that duplex CuAl coating has higher hardness than the single α-phase CuAl coating but the former has poorer resistance against fretting wear than the latter in mixed stick-slip regime and gross slip regime. The toughness reduction due to the dendritic distribution of the β' phase in duplex CuAl coating could explain the low fretting wear resistance observed in the duplex coating. In stick regime, single α-phase CuAl coating has a lower friction coefficient but it has a higher wear rate than the duplex coating, which is attributed to the lower hardness and hence more severe plastic deformation. © IMechE 2013.

Tribological behaviours of the untextured and textured films in a vacuum environment were investigated in detail. The results suggest that the wear life of a-C:H film is dramatically prolonged by surface texture with appropriate interval distances. A comprehensive friction and wear mechanism model is proposed based on substantial structural characterization and wear trace analyses. In this model, the generation of the hard and brittle wear debris is considered as the key unfavourable factor resulting in the rapid failure of a-C:H films, while the surface texture is beneficial in reducing the formation of wear debris, and further trapping it during the friction process. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The morphology, microstructure, and crystalline structure of as-prepared Fe-based metallic glass coatings were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. A Pycnometer and a Vickers hardness tester were adopted to measure the porosity and microhardness of iron-based metallic glass coatings. Moreover, differential scanning calorimetry analysis was conducted to investigate the crystallization behavior of various iron-based metallic glass coatings, and a ball-on-disk tribometer was performed to evaluate the tribological properties of the coatings coupled with silicon nitride ceramic balls under unlubricated conditions. It has been found that the microhardness of iron-based metallic glass coatings increases with increasing plasma arc power, which is related to the degree of melting of feedstock powders and the compactness of as-prepared coatings. Besides, the phase compositions of as-sprayed coatings consist of amorphous structure and limited crystalline structure, and the contents of the amorphous structure and crystalline structure vary with plasma arc power. Moreover, iron-based metallic glass coatings deposited at different plasma arc powers show similar steady-state friction coefficients (0.8-0.9), but their wear rate varies with varying plasma arc power. Particularly, iron-based metallic glass coating with next to the highest hardness exhibits the best anti-wear ability, which is the outcome of the compromise between the hardness and brittle fracture as well as abrasive wear of the coatings during sliding process. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, it is imperative to study the destructive mechanism so as to guarantee the smooth operation and increase the lifetime of military equipments. Accordingly, HTASED and corrosion were systematically observed and analyzed with the emphasis placed on the mechanism investigations making use of a series evaluation tests, typical missile engine simulation tests, national military standard methods, scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical corrosion tests. It is found that the thermal impact of high-temperature flame and supersonic erosion of corrosive melting particle jet of the SAMHSE lead to surface defects of micro-cracks, denudation and corrosive residue. Some defects reach to metal base becoming to corrosive channels. Repetitive HTASED may cause ablation-adhesion fatigue stress, which enhances the surface corrosion and destruction. HTASED and corrosion are related to the type of a SAMHSE fuel and experience of the launcher. Surface destruction is related to synergistic effects of the HTASED. The ablated and failed Al or steel surface is liable to electrochemical corrosion characterized by pitting in humid and salt-spray environment.

11444257432	Wear and transfer characteristics of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites under water lubrication	The tribological characteristics of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites under distilled-water-lubricated-sliding and dry-sliding against stainless steel were comparatively investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was utilized to examine composite microstructures and modes of failure. The typical chemical states of elements of the transfer film on the stainless steel were examined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Wear testing and SEM analysis show that all the composites hold the lowered friction coefficient and show much better wear resistance under water lubricated sliding against stainless steel than those under dry sliding. The wear of composites is characterized by plastic deformation, scuffing, micro cracking, and spelling under both dry-sliding and water lubricated conditions. Plastic deformation, scuffing, micro cracking, and spalling, however, are significantly a-bated under water-lubricated condition. XPS analysis conforms that none of the materials produces transfer films on the stainless steel counterface with the type familiar from dry sliding, and the transfer of composites onto the counterpart ring surface is significantly hindered while the oxidation of the stainless steel is speeded under water lubrication. The composites hinder transfer onto the steel surface and the boundary lubricating action of water accounts for the much smaller wear rate under water lubrication compared with that under dry sliding. The easier transfer of the composite onto the counterpart steel surface accounts for the larger wear rate of the polymer composite under dry sliding.

84921874436	Microstructural Characterization and Tribological Behavior of HVOF Sprayed NiMoAl Coating from 20 to 800 °C	NiMoAl coating was deposited by high velocity oxy-fuel spraying from gas-atomized powders and its tribological properties from 20 to 800 °C under unlubricated conditions were evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the coating and corresponding wear tracks to determine the lubrication mechanisms. The friction coefficient of NiMoAl coating that decreased gradually with the increase of temperature exhibited the highest value of 0.8 at 20 °C and the lowest value of 0.29 at 800 °C. Meanwhile, NiMoAl coating also possessed an excellent anti-wear property and the wear rate of the coating maintained at a relatively low value at all test temperatures. Characterizations of worn surfaces revealed that the coating suffered abrasive wear at the low temperature. When the temperature elevated to 600 and 800 °C, molybdenum oxide and nickel molybdate that were formed through tribo-chemistry reactions acted as lubricants at the high temperature. In addition, NiMoAl coating experienced no obvious oxidation or phase transition on the unrubbed surface during the friction test at 800 °C, indicating that the coating performed both thermal stability and lubrication function at the high temperature.
