14844331454	Overexpression of the cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated-genes regulate the rat primary VSMCs differentiation in vitro	To elucidate the role of cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) in the phenotype modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), human CREG (hCREG) was overexpressed in primary rat VSMCs was using a mammalian expression vector pRC/CMV-hCREG. Transient transfection of VSMCs with hCREG inhibited cell proliferation and DNA synthesis as evidenced by decrease in BrdU incorporation. Moreover, CREG overexpression increased SM α-actin protein level in VSMCs. Co-transfection of VSMCs with SM α-actin promoter reporter gene with hCREG enhanced SM α-actin promoter activity, suggesting that elevated SM α-actin protein production resulted from increased gene transcription. The mechanism by which CREG regulates VSMC phenotype conversion was further investigated by analysis of interaction of CREG with serum response factor (SRF), an important transcriptional factor involved in VSMC differentiation. CREG co-immunoprecipitated with SRF and CREG overexpression increased the SRF bound to CREG. In addition, gel mobility shift assay and supershift assay showed that CREG bound together with SRF to the CArG site of SM α-actin promoter. These results suggest that CREG acts as a transcriptional factor and interacts with SRF to promote VSMC differentiation.

27644534360	Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cell and the expression of transforming growth factor beta/smads	Aim: To observe the phenothpe changes of proliferation and differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells associated with the signal pathway of transforming growth factor beta/smads. Methods: The study was finished in the Research Room of Genetics of Harbin Medical University between September and October 2003. Healthy male SD rats, weighing about 200 g, were used. The model of rat vascular smooth muscle cells was constructed by primary culture, and then cultured in the fetal bovine serum with the volume fraction of 0.2 and 0.05 (serum-deprivation culture) and Dulbecco modified Eaglethe medium at 37 °C, the volume fraction of carbon dioxide was 0.05, and passaged with 2.5 g/L pancreatin digestion. After trypan blue staining, more than 98% of the vascular smooth muscle cells survived. Morphologically, classic "peak" and "valley" shape growth states were observed, anti-smooth muscle specific alpha-actin protein was positive detected with immunohistochemical staining. Cells of the 3rd and 8th passages were used in the study. The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells of different phenotype was detected with flow cytometry; The changes of differentiation related gene smooth muscle specific alpha-actin protein expression of smooth muscle cells were determined with western blot analysis; The changes of the expressions of transforming growth factor beta type I receptor, smad2, smad3, smad4 and smad7 were detected with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence method. Results: 1 Flow cytometry analysis and western blot analysis found that after serum-deprivation culture, the proliferation of primarily cultured vascular smooth cells was decreased, the cells at DNA G1 phase was obviously increased[(52.42 ± 2.35)%], and expression of differentiated gene smooth muscle specific actin was obvious; After culture in the fetal bovine serum with the volume fraction of 0.2, the proliferation of primarily cultured vascular smooth cells was productive, the number of cells at DNA G1 phase was fewer relatively[(17.23 ± 1.58)%], the expression of differentiation related gene smooth muscle specific alpha-actin protein was obviously down-regulated. 2 The detection with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence method showed that after serum-deprivation culture in the differentiated smooth muscle cells, the expression of transforming growth factor beta type I receptor was increased, the expressions of smad2 and smad3 had unobvious changes, the expression of smad4 was increased, and that of smad7 was decreased; After culture in high serum, the smooth muscle cells were induced to transform to proliferation phenotype, the expression of transforming growth factor beta type I receptor was decreased, the expression of smad4 was decreased, that of inhibitory smad7 was increased, and there were no obvious changes in the expressions of smad2 and smad3. Conclusion: The expression of transforming growth factor beta/smads is closely correlated with the phenotype state of vascular smooth muscle cells. During differentiation, vascular smooth muscle cells may regulate the differentiating function through transforming growth factor beta type I receptor/smad4; While during proliferation, vascular smooth muscle cells may play its role through smad7 signal pathway. It is indicated that transforming growth factor beta/smads plays a role in the molecular regulation of vascular smooth muscle cells reversing from the phenotype of synthesis to differentiation.

29244451403	The cloning and expression of apoptosis associated gene ANNEXIN A2 induced by p53 gene	Objective: To identify the relationship between p53-dependent apoptosis associated genes and tumor metastasis. Methods: mRNA differential display (mRNA DD) was adopted for gene cloning after the different metastatic potential lung cancer cell lines were infected by Adv-p53 (a reconstructed adenovirus encoding wild type p53 gene). RT-PCR, Northern blot and Western blot assays were used to confirm the result from mRNA DD. Results: After induction by p53 gene, the ANNEXIN A2 gene had differential expression in the cell lines; its level was down-regulated in all the cells infected by Adv-p53 gene, especially in the Anip973 cell lines with high metastatic potential. RT-PCR, Northern blot and Western blot assays confirmed the consequence. Conclusion: The experimental data suggest that the ANNEXIN A2 gene may relate to cellular apoptosis induced by p53 gene. The affirmative relationship between ANNEXIN A2 gene and p53 needs further investigation.

33745994303	Establishment of clones of SM22α-EGFP expressing embryonic stem cells and in vitro dynamic tracing of smooth muscle cells development	A murine embryonic stem cell (ESC) line stably expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the transcriptional control of the smooth-muscle-specific SM22α promoter to further characterize development of the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) differentiated from ESCs is established. In SM22α-EGFP expressing ESC-derived embryoid bodies(EBs), a distinct sublineage of VSMCs could be identified by EGFP fluorescence. The SM22α promoter was switched on at day 11, and EGFP-positive cells increased gradually and reached peak at day 30. The specificity of EGFP positive cells was corroborated by RT-PCR analysis and immunostaining with antibodies against known markers for VSMCs. VSMCs were heterogeneous in their morphology in plating EBs, and could be divided into two categories: spindle-shaped or epithelioid, polygonal cells. These results suggest that SM22α-EGFP expression enables the identification of ESC -derived VSMCs by their fluorescence and morphology.

33947164708	Association of C1019T polymorphism in the connexin37 gene and coronary artery disease in Chinese Han population	Objective: To investigate the association between the connexin37 (CX37) C1019T polymorphism and the susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD) in northern Han population of China. Methods: A total of 514 CAD patients and 400 healthy controls diagnosed by angiography were genotyped by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results: The genotype frequencies of CC, TC and TT in the CX37 C1019T polymorphism was 22.37%, 53.31% and 24.32% in CAD patients, 17.75%, 46.50% and 35.75% in the controls respectively (P = 0.0007). The frequency of the CX37 C allele in CAD patients was significantly higher than that of the control group (49.03% vs 41.00%, OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.15 - 1.66, P = 0.0006). The frequency of the C allele carriers (CC + TC) was 75.68% in the CAD group and 64.25% in the control group (P = 0.0002). Compared with the TT homozygote, the CAD risk was significantly increased in the carriers of C allele (CC + TC) (OR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.30 - 2.30). Subsequent stratified analysis revealed that the frequency of C allele was significantly higher in the male CAD patients than in the male controls (49.37% vs 39.60%, OR = 1.49,95% CI = 1.18 -1.89, P = 0.0009). The CAD risk was nearly two-fold increased in the carriers of C allele (CC + TC) than in the TT homozygote (95% CI = 1.38 - 2.78). However in the female population, there was no difference in the CAD risk between the carriers of (CC + TC) type and the TT homozygote (P = 0.24). Conclusion: The C allele in the CX37 gene might be associated with the susceptibility to CAD and potentially plays an important role in the manifestation of coronary atherosclerosis among Chinese.

34547819138	Transcriptional factor E2F1 inhibits expression of the cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes and regulates VSMCs differentiation in vitro	The human cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (hCREG), originally cloned from the cDNA library of HeLa cell line, was found to rapidly induce the differentiation of diverse type cells such as pluripotent mouse EC cells, monocytes U937 and myeloid cells EML. It was identified in previous study that not only could overexpression of hCREG regulate and hold the differentiation vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro, but inhibit the neointima formation in rat carotid artery after balloon injury. These properties suggest that hCREG might have played an important role in antagonizing restenosis of vessel by inhibiting phenotypic modulation of VSMCs. In order to further elucidate the biological functions of hCREG in VSMCs, the upstream molecule mechanisms in regulating its expression were analyzed. At first, bioinformatics was used to predict the hCREG promoter and the binding sites of transcriptional factors. According to bioinformatic results, the pEGFP-hCREG-P945 reporter gene vector was constructed successfully which contained upstream 945 bp of hCREG where two binding sites of E2F1 were determined. Subsequently, the hCREG promoter activity was identified directly by detecting the expression of reporter protein-GFP with fluorescence microscope and Western blot analysis when the vector was transfected into human VSMCs-HITASY. Secondly, both the expression of hCREG and smooth muscle α-actin(SM α-actin) was detected to increase in differentiation HITASY cells cultured for 72 h with serum deprivation! in which the expression of E2F1 was reduced significantly. Inversely, the increase of E2F1 expression was detected in dedifferentiation cells cultured with 10% FBS medium accompanied with the reduction of hCREG and SM a-actin. It is suggested that E2F1 maybe inhibit the expression of hCREG by binding to the hCREG promoter. Furthermore, the E2F1 oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and mismatch E2F1 ODN were designed and used to block the binding of E2F1 to hCREG promoter by transcriptional factor "decoy strategy", Western blot analysis showed that expression of hCREG, GFP and SM a-actin was increased obviously when the E2F1 ODN was transfected in dedifferentiation HITASY cells. The result identified that transcription factor E2F1 inhibited the expression of hCREG and promote dedifferentiation of VSMCs by binding to the sites of hCREG promoter. It can be concluded that E2F1, as a transcriptional regulation factor of hCREG, can repress the expression of hCREG and involve in a pivotal role in the process of VSMCs phenotypic modulation.

34548750419	Relationship of the CAG repeat polymorphism of the MEF2A gene and coronary artery disease in a Chinese population	Background: Recently, a mutation in the human myocyte enhancer factor-2A (MEF2A) gene was reported to be responsible for an autosomal dominant form of coronary artery disease (CAD). In addition, missense mutations in sporadic CAD patients were also described. Both results support the disease-causing relationship between MEF2A and CAD/myocardial infarction. On the other hand, conflicting hypotheses have been put forward in other studies. Methods: We screened exons 7 and 11 of MEF2A through single-stranded conformation polymorphism PCR and direct sequencing to clarify the relationship between MEF2A and CAD in an independent case-control study involving 726 individuals in China. Results: Exon 11 showed a high degree of heterogeneity, which was caused by a polyglutamine (CAG)

36048999781	Expression and changes of endothelial and smooth muscle cell markers in dorsal aorta during the development of mouse embryo	Aim: To observe the expression regularity of fetal liver kinase-1 (FIk-1) and smooth muscle α-actin (SM α-actin) in the dorsal aorta during the development of mouse embryo, and to investigate initially the formation and origin of endothelium and smooth muscle cells of the dorsal aorta. Methods: The experiment was performed in the Department of Cardiology, Cardiovascular Research Institute, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command of Chinese PLA from January 2006 to January 2007. 1 Thirty female Kunming mica (20-22 g) were mated with male mice (20-22 g) overnight. The embryos were harvested on day 8.5 after pregnancy, 10 embryos at each time point from the 8.5th day to 18.5th day. 2 Morphological changes of the dorsal aorta of mouse embryos were observed in sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and the expression of endothelial markers Flk-1, CD31, factor VIII-related antigen and smooth muscle cell marker SM α-actin and their correlation were investigated by immunohistochemical method. Results: 1 From 8.5 to 9.5 days, the monolayer cells-formed dorsal aorta expressed Flk-1 and CD31, but not SM α-actin and factor VIII-related antigen. 2 FIk-1, CD31, factor VIII-related antigen and SM α-actin were co-expressed in monolayer calls-formed dorsal aorta on day 10.5. 3 The dorsal aorta wall consisted of multilayer cells at 11.5th day. Endothecium cells expressed FIk-1 instead of SM α-actin; meanwhile, exothecium cells expressed SM α-actin instead of FIk-1. There was no clear boundary between the dorsal aorta wall and the surrounding mesenchymal calls: Some scattered SM α-actin-positive cells could be observed around the dorsal aorta. 4 After 11.5 days, smooth muscle cells of the dorsal aorta grew in number and transformed from irregular calls into spindle-shaped cells. FIk-1 remained positive in endothelial cells, and SM α-actin in smooth muscle cells. There was a clear boundary between the dorsal aorta wall and the surrounding mesenchymal tissue. No SM α-actin-positive cells could be seen surrounding the dorsal aorta. Conclusion: The earliest derivation of the smooth muscle cells of the embryonic dorsal aorta may be from FIk-1, CD31-positive calls, and from recruitment and differentiation of the surrounding mesenchymal cells in the later period.

36349024309	Estrogen-eluting stent implantation inhibits neointimal formation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation	Objectives: The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and the mechanism of 17β-estradiol-eluting stents on inhibiting neointimal formation of abdominal aortas in rabbits fed with high fat diet. Background: Animal experiments have shown that local delivery of estrogen reduced neointimal formation after coronary angioplasty. Preliminary trial of estrogen-eluting stent implantation in patients with coronary disease also suggests a reduction in restenosis. Methods: We implanted 17β-estradiol-eluting stents, or control phosphorylcholine- coated stents, or bare metal stents of abdominal aortas in rabbits fed with high fat diet. Histology, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis were used to assess the efficacy and mechanism of inhibiting neointimal formation of 17β-estradiol-eluting stents. Results: Western blot analysis revealed marked increase in ERK phosphorylation in 30 min after deployment of phosphorylcholine-coated or bare metal stents, indicating activation of MAP kinase pathway. Immunohistochemistry showed intense staining of phospho-ERK in the medial smooth muscle cells in stent-implanted region. Extensive neointimal hyperplasia developed 12 weeks after stenting. In contrast, we observed significant inhibition of ERK phosphorylation and neointimal thickening in estrogen-eluting stent-implanted animals. Immunohistochemistry of factor VIII-related antigen demonstrated an accelerated reendothelialization as compared with the bare metal stent or phosphorylcholine-coated stent-implanted controls. Conclusions: Current study suggests that estrogen-eluting stents reduce neointimal formation and hence prevent restenosis after angioplasty possibly by inhibiting ERK activation in smooth muscle cells and promoting reendothelialization. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

37549056955	Nerve growth factor promotes formation of lumen-like structures in vitro through inducing apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells	Recent evidence suggests that apoptosis of endothelial cells contributes to lumen formation during angiogenesis, but the biological mechanism remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the effect of nerve growth factor (NGF), a member of the neurotrophin family and a potential angiogenic factor, on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) apoptosis and the formation of lumen-like structures (LLS) by cultured HUVEC on Matrigel. We demonstrate that NGF induces cell apoptosis. NGF treatment has no significant effect on the expression level of its two receptors, TrkA and p75NTR. Blockade of both TrkA and p75NTR, but not that of either receptor alone significantly decreases NGF-induced cell apoptosis. NGF significantly increases formation of LLS which consist substantially of apoptotic cells. Application of NGF-neutralizing antibody or simultaneous blockade of TrkA and p75NTR significantly blocks spontaneous and NGF-induced LLS formation. These data support a role for NGF-induced cell apoptosis in LLS formation in vitro. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

79951581534	Pattern of expression of the CREG gene and CREG protein in the mouse embryo	The cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) is a secreted glycoprotein that inhibits cell proliferation and/or enhances differentiation. CREG is widely expressed in adult tissues such as the brain, heart, lungs, liver, intestines and kidneys in mice. We investigated the level of CREG expression during mouse embryogenesis and its distribution at 18.5 days post coitus (dpc) using immunohistochemical staining with diaminobenzidine, western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. CREG expression was first detected in mouse embryos at 4.5 dpc. It was expressed at almost all stages up to 18.5 dpc. The level of CREG was found to increase gradually and was highest at 18.5 dpc. Western blotting showed that the CREG protein was expressed at higher levels in the brain, heart, intestines and kidneys than in the lungs and liver at 18.5 dpc. In 9.5 dpc embryos, CREG was expressed only in the endothelial cells of blood vessels, after the vascular lumen had formed. With advanced differentiation, vascular smooth muscle cells developed in the embryonic vascular structures; the expression of smooth muscle α-actin protein and CREG were positive and increased gradually in 10.5 dpc embryonic vessels. CREG expression in the embryonic blood vessels peaked at 15.5 dpc and was reduced slightly at 18.5 dpc. These results indicate that CREG is expressed during mouse embryogenesis and might participate in the differentiation of these organs during embryogenesis. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84861455864	CREG mediated adventitial fibroblast phenotype modulation: A possible therapeutic target for proliferative vascular disease	Proliferative vascular diseases, of which neointimal formation is a key pathological feature, cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Adventitia is the outermost connective tissue that surrounds an artery. In recent years, accumulating data indicate that adventitial fibroblasts participate in the formation of neointimal lesions. Our previous studies have demonstrated that cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) plays critical roles in reducing neointimal hyperplasia by promoting vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation and grow arrest and inhibiting migration. Hence, it is plausible that genetical modification with CREG gene in adventitial fibroblasts might inhibit angiotensin II-induced transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts, proliferation and migration, as well as adventitial thickening, finally decreasing neointimal formation. Possible mechanisms may include CREG direct attenuation of reactive oxygen species derived from reduced cathepsin-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase and indirect suppression of the downstream of NADPH oxidase including ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK pathways in adventitial fibroblasts. Therefore, CREG may be a potential therapeutic target for proliferative vascular diseases. © 2012.

84877735183	Cellular repressor of E1A stimulated genes enhances endothelial monolayer integrity	Cellular repressor of E1A stimulated genes (CREG) is a novel modulator that maintains the homeostasis of vascular cells. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of CREG on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-mediated inflammatory injury of vascular endothelial cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured and CREG overexpressing (VC), knockdown (VS) and mock-transfected (VE) HUVECs were challenged with TNF-α. We demonstrated that TNF-α prompted robust intercellular filamentous actin (F-actin) stress fiber formation as examined by rhodamin-phalloidin staining. Transwell assay and rhodamine B isothiocyanate-dextran staining indicated that TNF-α induced intercellular hyperpermeability of the HUVEC monolayers. These effects were attenuated in VC cells with forced CREG overexpression but significantly potentiated in VS cells with CREG silencing. After TNF-α stimulation, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 secretions in VE cells were markedly increased and inducible nitric oxidase (iNOS) expression substantially elevated, whereas these effects were pronouncedly damped in VC cells. Conversely, in VS cells, the increase in inflammatory markers was substantially potentiated. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) slowly and transiently translocated into the nuclei of VC cells upon TNF-α stimulation. However, a more swift and sustained nuclear translocation was observed in VS as compared to VE cells. Corresponding changes in the pattern of its protein expression was also observed. These data suggested that CREG can inhibit NF-κB activation, TNF-α-induced inflammatory responses and the hyperpermeability of endothelial cells, and may therefore represent a potential therapeutic target for pathological vascular injury. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84907963279	Contribution of homeostatic chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 and their receptor CCR7 to coronary artery disease	OBJECTIVE - Our aim was to identify the role of the homeostatic chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 and their common receptor CCR7 in atherogenesis and to study the relationships between CCL19, CCL21, and CCR7 gene variants and coronary artery disease in a Chinese Han population. APPROACH AND RESULTS - Immunohistochemical analysis of samples with atherosclerosis of various stages showed increased CCL19, CCL21, and CCR7 expression in atherosclerotic coronary plaques compared with nonatherosclerotic controls. Expression levels increased in positive correlation with coronary lesion stage. Cell adhesion assays confirmed that CCL19 promoted monocyte adhesion, which was induced by CCR7, to human umbilical vein endothelial cells, an effect partially antagonized by atorvastatin. After the human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with CCR7-neutralizing antibody, both CCL19- and CCL21-induced monocyte to human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration and CCL19-induced monocyte to human umbilical vein endothelial cell adhesion were abolished. The associations between genetic variants of CCL19, CCL21, CCR7, and coronary artery disease in a Chinese Han population were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The following single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with coronary artery disease: CCL19 rs2227302, CCL21 rs2812377, and CCR7 rs588019. Individuals with the CCL19 rs2227302 T allele or CCL21 rs2812377 G allele had higher plasma CCL19 levels than those with C/C genotype and higher CCL21 levels than those with T/T genotype in both case and control subjects. CONCLUSION - CCL19/CCL21-CCR7 is a novel homeostatic chemokine system that modulates human monocyte adhesion and migration, promoting atherogenesis. It is associated with coronary artery disease risk in Chinese Han individuals. These data suggest that the CCL19/CCL21-CCR7 axis plays an important role in atherosclerosis progression. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.

44449149187	CREG promotes a mature smooth muscle cell phenotype and reduces neointimal formation in balloon-injured rat carotid artery	Aim: We previously showed that cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) is up-regulated during serum starvation-induced vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation. The aim of this study was to determine the role of CREG in maintaining the quiescent, differentiated phenotype of SMCs both in culture and in balloon-injured rat carotid artery. Methods and results: In cultured SMCs recombinant virus-mediated CREG expression enhanced cellular differentiation, inhibited proliferation, and reduced synthesis of extracellular matrix component fibronectin. In contrast, CREG knockdown via retroviral transfer of short hairpin RNAs abrogated serum starvation-induced SMC differentiation and growth arrest. Both immunostaining and Western analysis demonstrated marked down-regulation of CREG in the vascular media after balloon injury to the rat carotid artery. Retrovirus-mediated CREG transfer to the injured artery inhibited SMC dedifferentiation and proliferation, and reduced neointimal hyperplasia. Conclusion: These results suggest that CREG participates in the maintenance of quiescent mature SMC phenotype in the arterial media by promoting SMC differentiation and growth arrest and that CREG gene transfer has therapeutic potential for vascular diseases associated with neointimal hyperplasia. © The Author 2008.

46349087533	Association of connexin 37 gene polymorphisms with risk of coronary artery disease in northern Han Chinese	Background: Recently, the C1019T polymorphism in the human gene encoding connexin 37 (CX37, encoded by GJA4) has been reported to be associated with coronary artery disease (CAD)/myocardial infarction in different racial groups, but no data are currently available in northern Han Chinese. The aim of our study is to investigate the association between 3 GJA4 gene polymorphisms (-1930C/T, C1019T and I1297D) and the susceptibility to CAD in northern Han Chinese. Methods: 502 CAD patients and 410 controls confirmed by coronary angiography were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in an independent case-control study. Results: The overall distribution of GJA4 C1019T genotypes among CAD patients and healthy controls was significantly different (p < 0.01). Frequencies of C1019T CC homozygote and C allele were significantly higher in the patient group than those in the control group. Stratification analysis showed that the C1019T C allele significantly increased the risk of CAD only among male subjects (p = 0.006; OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.09-1.74). After adjustment for conventional risk factors, binary logistic regression analysis showed that the C allele carrier (CC + CT) of C1019T was an independent risk factor for CAD (p < 0.05). Further linkage disequilibrium tests and haplotype analysis revealed that the C-C-D haplotype conferred an increased risk of CAD. Conclusions: Our study suggests that GJA4 gene C1019T polymorphism and/or its related C-C-D haplotype might contribute to an increased risk of CAD and potentially play an important role in the development of coronary atherosclerosis in northern Han Chinese.

45549106317	Adenovirus-mediated intra-arterial delivery of cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes inhibits neointima formation in rabbits after balloon injury	Objective: This study examined the effect on neointimal hyperplasia of adenovirus-mediated delivery of cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) to the artery after balloon injury. Methods: Sixty rabbits were randomized into three groups and underwent balloon injury in the left common carotid arteries. The injured arterial segment was isolated by two inflated balloon catheters. Saline or recombinant adenovirus expressing CREG or green fluorescent protein was injected into the lumen of the isolated arterial segments and incubated for 30 minutes. The rabbits were euthanized for immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and morphometric analysis at 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after balloon injury and in vivo gene transfer (5 rabbits for each time point). Common carotid artery angiography was performed before euthanasia. Results: Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis demonstrated that CREG expression was significantly down-regulated in the acute phase of vascular injury and was gradually restored in the resolution phase. The changes of CREG expression were in parallel with those of the smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation markers SM α-actin and SM myosin heavy chain in the injured arteries. Adenovirus-mediated CREG transfer markedly increased CREG expression in the injured artery. Consequently, morphometric analysis revealed an approximate 50% reduction in the neointima and the intima/media ratio in CREG-transferred arteries compared with the saline and green fluorescent protein controls. Assay with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine showed that CREG transfer significantly inhibited SMC proliferation. In contrast, endothelialization of the injured artery was not affected by CREG transduction as assessed by CD31 immunostaining. Conclusion: These data suggest that forced expression of CREG in the artery wall after acute vascular injury inhibits SMC proliferation, induces cellular differentiation, and attenuates neointimal hyperplasia. CREG delivery may have therapeutic potential for the prevention of restenosis after vascular angioplasty. © 2008 The Society for Vascular Surgery.

50849125695	Secreted CREG inhibits cell proliferation mediated by mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor in NIH3T3 fibroblasts	Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) is a recently described glycoprotein that plays a critical role in keeping cells or tissues in mature, homeostatic states. To understand the relationship between CREG and its membrane receptor, mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGF2R), we first generated stable NIH3T3 fibroblasts by transfection of pDS_shCREGs vectors, which produced an approximately 80% decrease in CREG levels both in the lysate and in the media. We used fluorescence activated cell sorting and a bromide deoxyuridine incorporation assay to identify whether CREG knockdown promoted the cell proliferation associated with the increase of IGF-II in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Proliferation was markedly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by re-addition of recombinant CREG protein into the media, and this was mediated by the membrane receptor M6P/IGF2R. We subsequently confirmed the direct interaction of CREG and M6P/IGF2R by both immunoprecipitation-Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. We found that expression of CREG correlated with localization of the receptor in NIH3T3 fibroblasts but did not affect its expression. Our findings indicated that CREG might act as a functional regulator of M6P/IGF2R to facilitate binding and trafficking of IGF-II endocytosis, leading to growth inhibition. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 by the Molecular Biology Society of Japan/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Design and methods 222 patients with ACS and 191 normal controls were examined by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Result: A significantly higher frequency of AA genotype of -519A/G polymorphism was observed in ACS patients than in the controls (P<0.001). The relative risk of ACS in patients carrying A allele of -519A/G polymorphism was 1.33 [P< 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.12-1.57]. Linkage disequilibrium test and haplotype analysis indicated that the AT haplotype significantly increased the risk of ACS (P =0.004, 95% CI =1.14-2.04, odds ratio=1.53). Compared with the AT haplotype, the GT haplotype was associated with a reduced occurrence of ACS (P<0.001, 95% CI=0.36-0.70, odds ratio=0.51). Conclusion Our findings suggested that genetic variations in the matrix metalloproteinase-1 gene promoter may contribute to interindividual variability in risk of ACS, and help predict susceptible individuals.

56749170350	Constructing RNA interference vector carrying cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes in mice	Background: Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle is the major mechanism of atherosclerosis and in-stent restenosis. Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) can inhibit the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle, and become the new therapy target in cardiovascular field. Objective: To construct the small molecular CREG RNA eukaryotic expression vector, and down-regulate CREG expression in mice cells. Design, time and setting: The observation experiment was performed at Cardiovascular Research Institute, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command from April to October, 2007. Materials: Mice fibroblast (NIH3T3) was provided by Professor Shaohua Li from Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Jersey, USA. Methods: Four pairs of short hairpin RNA which could be linked with CREG were designed by on-line RNAi Design. Chemical synthesis method was used to synthesize and clone short hairpin RNA to the pEN_mH1c vector. After LR were recombined with pDS_hpEY, pDSℋCREGs vectors with 4 types of different impressions shCREG fragments were obtained. Lipofectamine™ 2000 was used to transfect pDSℋCREGs into NIH3T3 cells and select stably transfected cell clones using G418. Main outcome measures: Silencing efficiency of CREG was examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein immunoblotting, respectively. Results: Restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing results confirmed that sequence of inserted fragment in 4 types of recombinant pDSℋCREG vector was correct. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein immunoblotting proved that the CREG level in stably transfected cells was declined to different extents, and the RNA and protein expression of clone cells were decreased 87% and 70% respectively in stably transfected pDSℋCREG1. Conclusion: Eukaryotic expression vector of CREG gene was successfully constructed, and expression level of CREG protein in NIH3T3 cells decreased significantly in vitro.

64849098449	A monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 gene polymorphism is not associated with coronary artery disease in a Han Chinese population	Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most common forms of heart diseases. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 gene (MCP-1, CCL2) has been considered one of the candidate genes that play a role in atherogenesis of CAD. Recently, the association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MCP-1 gene promoter (-2518A > G) and CAD has been investigated with controversial results. Methods: The -2518A > G polymorphism of MCP-1 was determined in 502 CAD patients and 410 control subjects to investigate the possible involvement of MCP-1 in CAD. Results: No significant differences in the genotype or allele frequencies were revealed between subjects with and without CAD (P = 0.581 and 0.310, respectively). Further stratification analysis by gender or age and analysis of clinical features in relation to myocardial infarction also yielded negative results. Conclusion: -2518A > G polymorphism of MCP-1 does not seem to contribute substantially to CAD in Han Chinese. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

67649172859	Association of interleukin-18 gene promoter polymorphisms with risk of acute myocardial infarction in northern Chinese Han population	Background: Interleukin-18 (IL-18) has been suggested to play an important role in coronary arterial disease and its sequelae. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between IL-18 promoter functional polymorphisms (-607C/A and -137G/C) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in northern Chinese Han population. Methods: We performed a case-control study including 234 patients with AMI and 216 age- and sex-matched controls. Genotyping was performed using sequence specific primer-polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP). Results: There were significant differences in the genotype and allele distribution of -607C/A polymorphism of the IL-18 gene between cases and controls. Logistic regression analysis with adjustments for other well-established risk factors revealed that the -607C allele carriers had a significantly increased risk of AMI compared with the non-carriers (OR=1.890, 95% CI 1.196-2.985, p=0.006). No relationship between -137G/C polymorphism and AMI was found. Conclusions: This study shows for the first time that the IL-18 gene promoter -607C/A polymorphism may be considered a genetic risk factor for AMI in northern Chinese Han population. © 2009 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin New York.

70349220924	Inhibition of raci activity hinders vasculogenesis during early embryonic development	Whether small G protein Rac1 plays a role in regulating blood vessel formation especially endothelial cells(ECs) differentiation during early embryonic vascular development remains unclear. Murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) lines stably expressing the constitutively active Rac1 mutant (Rac1G12V) or dominant negative Rac1 mutant (Rac1T17N) and the resulting embryoid bodies (EBs) were established as models, to observe the effects of Rac1 on the differentiation and migration of ECs. Using contrast phase microscope to observe the development and differentiation features of EBs; pull-down assay to analyze the expression of Rac1 activity; immunofluorescence staining and Western blot to inspect the differentiation markers of ECs; matrigel model to observe the assembly of endothelial network. It showed that neither increase nor suppression of Rac1 activity significantly affect the differentiation of EBs to form the typical primitive germ layers. Expression of dominant negative Rac1 did not affect ECs differentiation, but it significantly inhibited cell migration, furthermore completely blocked the assembly of vessel network. Actin stress fibers were largely absent in Rac1T17N-expressing cells. Expression of Rac1T17N inhibited FAK activity while Rac1G12V did not affect it compared with control group. These results indicated that the effect factor of Rac1 on the vasculogenesis of EBs was to inhibit cell migration which probably mediated by F-actin mechanism.

70350404651	CREG inhibits migration of human vascular smooth muscle cells by mediating IGF-II endocytosis	We previously determined that the cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes, (CREG) plays a role in the maintenance of the mature phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). This study aimed to identify the role of CREG in modulating the migration of SMCs. Recombinant virus-mediated CREG expression inhibited the cellular migration of cultured SMCs associated with down-regulated activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). In contrast, CREG knockdown via the retroviral transfer of short hairpin RNAs promoted cellular migration. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and endocytosis analysis revealed that CREG knockdown attenuated the internalization and increased secretion of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II. Western blot analysis demonstrated that both phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and phosphatase Akt were enhanced in CREG knockdown SMCs. Furthermore, the effect of CREG knockdown on SMC migration was abrogated in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of either IGF-II neutralizing antibody or the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. These results indicate that the CREG knockdown-mediated increase in IGF-II secretion promoted cellular migration in SMCs via the PI3K/Akt signal pathway. Additionally, blockage of IGF-II binding to the mannose-6-phosphate/IGF-II receptor (M6P/IGF2R) by IGF2R antibody or recombinant IGF2R fragment attenuated the endocytosis of IGF-II in cells overexpressing CREG. This indicates that M6P/IGF2R is involved in the regulation of CREG-mediated IGF-II endocytosis. In summary, these data demonstrate for the first time that CREG plays a critical role in the inhibition of SMC migration, as well as maintaining SMCs in a mature phenotype. These results may provide a new therapeutic target for vascular disease associated with neointimal hyperplasia. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

70350704639	Effect of cellular repressor protein of E1A-stimulated genes on the apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells	BACKGROUND: Researches on the mechanism of vascular endothelial cells' apoptosis and its relation with atherosclerosis will provide new ideas for the prevention and cure of atherosclerosis. Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) protein's effect on vascular endothelial cells' apoptosis is unknown now. OBJECTIVE: To explore the CREG protein's effects and its mechanism on regulating the apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) induced by cultivation with 1% serum medium. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: The experiment was performed in the laboratory of Cardiovascular Institute of Chinese PLA, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command of Chinese PLA from October 2007 to December 2008. MATERIALS: HUVEC, Phoenix amphotropic 293 cells, pLNCX-CREG and pLNCX-GFP retroviral eukaryotic expression vectors. METHODS: The HUVEC were starved by exposure to 1% serum medium for 24, 48, 72 hours, and apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining and Western blot which detected the expression of cleave-caspase3. Retrovirus eukaryotic expression vectors pLNCX-CREG and pLNCX-GFP were transfected to HUVEC, and cell clones that expressed stably were selected. The expression of CREG was analyzed by Western blot, the effect of over-expression of CREG on apoptosis of HUVEC that induced by starved cultivation with 1% serum medium was further analyzed by flow cytometry after fluorescent staining. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Expression of cleave-caspase3, apoptosis ratio of HUVEC. RESULTS: The CREG over-expressed HUVEC model was constructed successfully, demonstrating CREG expression increased with the augmentation of apoptosis and apoptosis of over-expressing CREG HUVEC after starved cultivation with 1% serum medium decreased compared with control group. CONCLUSION: CREG overexpression inhibits the apoptosis of HUVEC, and the mechanism is possibly concerned with its regulation on the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase protein.

73549097082	Endogenous transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1 promotes differentiation of smooth muscle cells from embryonic stem cells: Stable plasmid-based siRNA silencing of TGF beta1 gene expression	Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1 has been shown to promote differentiation of smooth muscle cells (SMC) from some precursor cells. Whether endogenous TGF beta1 also contributes to SMC differentiation during embryogenesis, however, remains unclear. In this study, a plasmid-based TGF beta1 RNA interference embryonic stem (ES) cell line was constructed. Morphological observation showed that TGF beta1 knockdown significantly prevented differentiated cells from outgrowing from ES cells-derived embryoid bodies (EBs). Immunofluorescence staining indicated that SM alpha-actin-positive cells were confluent and dense in the control group but dispersed in the TGF beta1 knockdown group. RT-PCR and western blot suggested that TGF beta1 knockdown resulted in a decrease in the expression of early SMC markers SM alpha-actin and myocardin in EBs. Both the retarded extension of cell outgrowth and the decrease in SM alpha-actin and myocardin expression could not be rescued by addition of exogenous TGF beta1. These data suggest that endogenous TGF beta1 promotes differentiation of SMC from ES cells. © 2009 The Physiological Society of Japan and Springer.

74249090615	Association analysis of the IL-17F His161Arg polymorphism in myocardial infarction	Background: There is growing evidence that coronary atherosclerosis and its most severe phenotype, myocardial infarction (MI), are chronic inflammatory diseases. Interleukins are important mediators and modulators of inflammation. The His161Arg polymorphism in the gene encoding of IL-17F has recently been consistently found to be associated with chronic inflammatory disorders. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that the variant also affects the risk of MI. Methods: We conducted a case-control association study on a cohort of 513 unrelated MI patients and 477 age-matched and sex-matched controls in a Chinese Han population. Results: Differences in the genotype distributions and allele frequencies of this polymorphism between cases and controls were insignificant (P=0.38 and 0.57, respectively). Further stratification for age, sex, the number of diseased coronary arteries, and other cardiovascular risk factors did not affect the negative findings. Conclusion: This study indicates for the first time that, unlike other chronic inflammatory diseases, the IL-17F His161Arg polymorphism is unlikely to be a major contributor to the pathogenesis of MI. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

77949271526	Association of the SDF1-3′A polymorphism with susceptibility to myocardial infarction in Chinese Han population	SDF-1 has been demonstrated to be involved in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. This study was aimed to investigate whether the SDF1-3′A polymorphism (rs1801157) is associated to myocardial infarction (MI) in a sample of Chinese Han population. A total of 560 patients with MI and 532 controls were enrolled in the study. The SDF1-3′A polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction -restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. A significant difference in genotype distribution and allele frequency was observed between patients and controls (P = 0.003 and P = 0.001, respectively). The A allele carriers had a significantly reduced MI risk compared with the GG homozygotes (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52-0.92; adjusted P = 0.007) in a logistic regression model after controlling conventional risk factors. The present study showed a significant association between the SDF1-3′A polymorphism and MI in Chinese Han population. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

77951173996	Overexpression of the cellular repressor of e1a-stimulated genes inhibits the apoptosis of human vascular smooth muscle cells via blocking p38/JNK MAP kinase activation	The cellular repressor of ElA-stimulated genes (CREG) is a recently described glycoprotein which plays a critical role in keeping cells or tissue in homeostasis states. The current study examined whether and how CREG may regulate VSMC apoptosis. Both loss-of-function (CREG-DW by retrovirus expressing CREG shRNAs) and gain-of-function (CREG-UP by retroviral infection with vector pLNCX-CREG) studies were performed to support this notion. Western blot showed that CREG knockdown stimulated with STS or VP-16 was identified to increase cleaved caspase-3, a marker for apoptosis. It was also observed that the number of cells undergoing apoptosis remarkably increased in CREG-DW cells by annexin V/PI dual-color flow cytometry and TUNEL assays. Moreover, p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases were significantly upregulated in CREG-DW and significantly reduced in CREG-UP VSMCs. More importantly, CREG-DW-induced VSMC apoptosis was blocked by a p38-specific inhibitor (SB203580), or by overexpression of a dominant negative p38a (p38a AGF). The data also showed that inactivation of p38 decreased the amount of phosphorylated JNK, indicated that the p38 fusion proteins are functionally active in regulating JNK activity and induced JNK phosphorylation contributes positively to VSMC apoptosis. In addition, CREG-UP increased expression of the VSMC differentiation markers SM ct-actin and SM-MHC, and reduced cell-associated fibronectin in cultured VSMCs. These results demonstrate for the first time that CREG plays a key role in modulating VSMC apoptosis by p38/JNK signaling transduction pathway in vitro- Accordingly, CREG might have potential applicational perspective in attenuating the progression of atherosclerotic plaques and restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention.

77952428770	An intron polymorphism in the CXCL16 gene is associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease in Chinese Han population: A large angiography-based study	Objective: Experimental and clinical observations suggest that CXCL16, a recently discovered transmembrane chemokine combining functions of a chemokine and a scavenger receptor, could be an important player in atherosclerosis, but the relationship of its common variants with coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been extensively studied. Methods: We designed an angiography-based case-controlled study consisting of 1176 CAD patients and 850 control subjects to investigate the association between five common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CXCL16 gene and CAD risk in Chinese Han population. The plasma concentration of CXCL16 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: No significant differences were observed for the distributions of rs2250333, rs2304973, rs2277680, and rs1051009 between CAD patients and control subjects. However, both the genotype and allele frequencies of rs3744700 showed significant differences between cases and controls (P= 0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). The GG homozygotes had significantly higher CAD risk compared with the T allele carriers (GT. +. TT) (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.28-2.43; adjusted P<0.001) in a logistic regression model after adjustment for the conventional risk factors for CAD. The GG genotypes also had increased plasma CXCL16 levels compared with T allele carriers in both cases and control subjects. Conclusions: SNP rs3744700 of CXCL16 gene is independently associated with the development of CAD in Chinese Han population, and GG homozygote which is associated with increased expression of CXCL16 may have a promoting effect on CAD. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77952671940	Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes inhibits human vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis via blocking P38/JNK MAP kinase activation	Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis accelerates atherosclerosis and promotes restenosis following vascular injury. The current study examined the effects of cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG), a novel glycoprotein inhibiting transcription activation, on the regulation of VSMC apoptosis. Serum starvation or treatment of human VSMCs with apoptosis inducers (STS or VP-16) significantly reduced CREG expression and caused caspase-3 activation. CREG downregulation and caspase-3 activation were inversely related, suggesting that reduced CREG expression may contribute to VSMC apoptosis. Both loss-of-function (CREG-DW produced by retroviruses expressing CREG shRNAs) and gain-of-function (CREG-UP produced by retroviral infection with vector pLNCX-CREG) studies were performed to confirm this hypothesis. CREG-DW significantly increased VSMC apoptosis, whereas CREG-UP significantly reduced apoptosis. Moreover, p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases were significantly upregulated in CREG-DW and significantly reduced in CREG-UP VSMCs. More importantly, CREG-DW-induced VSMC apoptosis was blocked by the p38-specific inhibitor SB203580 or by overexpression of a dominant-negative P38α (p38α AGF). Balloon injury-induced vascular caspase-3 activation was significantly inhibited by treatment with recombinant CREG protein. These results demonstrated for the first time that CREG plays a key role in modulating VSMC apoptosis through the p38 and JNK signal transduction pathways, both in vitro and in situ. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

77953536348	Suppression of encephalitogenic T-cell responses by cilostazol is associated with upregulation of regulatory T cells	Cilostazol is a specific phosphodiesterase III inhibitor. Recent data show that cilostazol has anti-inflammatory effects and administration of cilostazol ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this study, we used a mouse EAE model to explore the role of cilostazol in Th1 and Th17 cell-mediated immune responses. We found that cilostazol suppressed mitogen or antigen-induced T-cell responses and Th17 cell differentiation in vitro, which correlated with enhanced Treg-cell responses. Beginning of oral administration of cilostazol at the onset of EAE significantly inhibited encephalitogenic T cells, reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the central nervous system, and ameliorated the severity of EAE. Moreover, administration of cilostazol markedly enhanced Treg-cell response in vivo. Cilostazol, therefore, may exert its therapeutic effects through upregulation of Treg-cell activity. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

MATERIALS: ESCs line R1 with number SCRC-1011TM was purchased from American ATCC Company. The pSM22a-EGFP vector was constructed by our laboratory. And the plRES2-EGFP, pSM2C and pSuper.basic vectors were purchased from Invitrogen Company. METHODS: SM22α promoter was cloned from pSM22α-EGFP by polymerase chain reaction. CMV promoter of plRES2-EGFP vector was replaced by SM22 promoter to establish pSM22a-IRES2-EGFP. Pac gene, excised from pSM2C by H/ndlll/C/al digestion, was sub-cloned into pSuper.basic to establish pSuper-PAC. After Bg\\\IAcc\ enzyme digestion of pSuper-PAC, pac gene fragment was obtained, which was further sub-cloned into pSM22α-IRES2-EGFP to produce pSM22α-PAC-IRES2-EGFP. ESCs were transfected with pSM22α-PAC-IRES2- EGFP using lipofectamine. Positive clones were selected by G418 and induced to differentiate and further identified by amplification of pac gene by RT-PCR. Differentiated cells were immunostained by SM a-actin, and expression of SM α-actin and EGFP was observed simultaneously under fluorescence microscope. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sequencing result of pSM22α-PAC-IRES2- EGFP; Amplification of pac gene; EGFP expression; as well as SM α-actin immunostaining. RESULTS: Three segments of 261 bp, 664 bp, and 5 000 bp were obtained by H/ndlll/C/al digestion, which was coincident with expectation, and the sequencing results showed that pSM22α-PAC-IRES2-EGFP vector was successfully constructed. Amplification of pac gene identified 4 ESCs clones successfully transfected. After induction of differentiation, partial portion of differentiated cells expressed EGFP, accompanied by positively stained by SM α-actin antibody. CONCLUSION: pSM22α-PAC-IRES2-EGFP vector was successfully constructed. ESCs clones transfected with this vector expressed pac gene and EGFP gene, and the expression of EGFP is smooth muscle specific.

78650235222	Lack of association between cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (GREG) polymorphisms and coronary artery disease in the Han population of North China	Background: Phenotypic switching of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic lesions such as coronary artery disease (CAD). Accumulating evidence demonstrates that a cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) plays a role in the maintenance of the mature phenotype of vascular SMCs. We assessed the possible association between CREG and CAD in the Han population of North China. Methods: The promoter region of CREG by direct sequencing was conducted in 48 subjects. Then SNP rs2995073 and another 4 tagSNPs (rs4657669, rs3767443, rs16859185, and rs3753921) were selected for the association study. All five selected SNPs were determined in 1161 patients with angiographically proven CAD and 960 controls with normal coronary angiograms to investigate the possible involvement of CREG in CAD. Results: Genotype frequencies of the 5 polymorphisms were similarly distributed between CAD group and controls (P> 0.05). Further haplotype analysis also found no significant differences in the distributions between CAD group and controls (P> 0.05). Conclusion: This study did not show an association between common variants of CREG and CAD in the northern Chinese Han population. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We systematically screened sequence variations in the IL17A gene and designed an angiography-based case-controlled study consisting of 1031 CAD patients and 935 control subjects to investigate the association between the selected polymorphisms of IL-17A gene and CAD risk in Chinese Han population. Frequencies of IL17A rs8193037 GG homozygote and G allele were significantly higher in the patient group than those in the control group (P< 0.001; OR=0.68; 95% CI=0.54-0.85). Stratification analysis showed that the IL17A rs8193037 G allele significantly increased the risk of CAD only among male subjects (P=0.001; OR=0.63; 95% CI=0.47-0.83). After adjustment for conventional risk factors, binary logistic regression analysis showed that the G allele carriers (GG. +. AG) had significantly increased CAD risk compared with the AA homozygotes (adjusted P< 0.001; OR 0.43; 95% CI, 0.33-0.58). ELISA showed augmented IL17A production in plasma of the AMI patients. Based on our data, we speculated that the SNP rs8193037 of IL17A gene is significantly associated with CAD risk in Chinese Han population and the rs8193037 G allele which is associated with increased expression of IL17A in AMI patients may be an independent predictive factor for CAD. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

79952071988	Glycosylation-independent binding to extracellular domains 11-13 of mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-2 receptor mediates the effects of soluble CREG on the phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells	The bio-effects of cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) have been proposed to depend on its N-glycosylation and binding to mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-2 receptor (M6P/IGF2R). The present study aimed to investigate the detailed mode and specific sites for their binding and the functional relevance of this binding in the phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Wild-type and glycosylation mutant human CREG (wtCREG and mCREG) proteins were expressed and isolated from HEK293 cells. CREG knocked-down SMCs were used to evaluate their biological activity. Both wtCREG and mCREG arrest cell cycle progression of CREG knocked-down SMCs when added to the culture medium. In vitro binding assay revealed that CREG bound to M6P/IGF2R extracellular domains 7-10 and 11-13 in a glycosylation-dependent and -independent manner, respectively. Further blocking experiments using soluble M6P/IGF2R fragments and M6P/IGF2R neutralizing antibody suggest that the binding to domains 11-13, as well as to 7-10, is adequate for CREG to modulate SMC proliferation. These data suggest that soluble CREG protein can exert its biological function via glycosylation-independent binding to the extracellular domains 11-13 of cell surface M6P/IGF2R, and thereby provide novel insights into CREG modulation of SMC phenotypic switching from contractile to proliferative. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79953025684	Overexpression of cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes inhibits TNF-α-induced apoptosis via NF-κB in mesenchymal stem cells	Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) show great potential for therapeutic repair after myocardial infarction. However, poor viability of transplanted MSCs in the ischemic heart has limited their use. Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) has been identified as a potent inhibitor of apoptosis. This study therefore aimed to determine if rat bone marrow MSCs transfected with CREG-were able to effectively resist apoptosis induced by inflammatory mediators, and to demonstrate the mechanism of CREG action. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometric and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling assays. The pathways mediating these apoptotic effects were investigated by Western blotting. Overexpression of CREG markedly protected MSCs from tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced apoptosis by 50% after 10 h, through inhibition of the death-receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway, leading to attenuation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. Moreover, CREG resisted the serine phosphorylation of IκBα and prevented the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) under TNF-α stimulation. Treatment of cells with the NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) significantly increased the transcription of pro-apoptosis proteins (p53 and Fas) by NF-κB, and attenuated the anti-apoptotic effects of CREG on MSCs. The results of this study indicate that CREG acts as a novel and potent survival factor in MSCs, and may therefore be a useful therapeutic adjunct for transplanting MSCs into the damaged heart after myocardial infarction. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

0036175957	Genescan analysis of non-small cell lung cancer in the long arm of chromosome 6	Objective: To investigate if there are microsatellite loci in the long arm of chromosome 6 that have close relationship with non-small cell lung cancer. Methods Multiple PCR approach was used to analyze the 18 loci in the long arm of chromosome 6. The PCR products were analyzed in PAGE, and then the electrophoresis maps were analyzed with Gene Scan™ and Genotyper™. Results There were different frequencies of logs of heterozygosity (LOH) in different loci (varying from 3. 85% to 38. 45%). The total frequency of LOH in 41 gastric cancers was 58.5% (24/41). Eight loci with the LOH frequency higher than 20% were mainly located in 2 regions: 6q24 and 6q27. The accurate location is 6q24-6q25. 3 [D6S1699(35%), D6S409(23.33%), D6S441(33.33%)] and 6q26-27 [D6S1550(38.45%), D6S264 (20%), D6S1585(25%), D6S446(33.33%), D6S281 (30.77%)]. Conclusion There may be tumor suppressor genes located in the region of 6q24 and 6q27, which have close relationship with non-small cell lung cancer.

80053314994	Interleukin-8 gene polymorphism is associated with acute coronary syndrome in the Chinese Han population	Background: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is one of the most common forms of heart disease. Recent studies have shown that interleukin (IL)-8 plays a key role in the development of atherosclerotic plaques, but the relationship between the common genetic variants of IL-8 and ACS has not been extensively studied. Methods: This case-control study in the Chinese Han population included 675 patients with ACS and 636 age- and sex-matched controls. We investigated IL-8 polymorphisms and their association with susceptibility to ACS. The investigation was replicated in the second study comprising 360 cases and 360 control subjects. The plasma concentration of IL-8 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: IL-8 -251 A/T polymorphism was associated with increased susceptibility to ACS (P=0.004; odds ratio = 1.30; 95% confidence interval: 1.12-1.53). The second study yielded similar results. An increased IL-8 level was found in the plasma of acute myocardial infarction patients, suggesting that IL-8 -251 A/T may affect the expression of IL-8. Conclusion: IL-8 -251 A/T polymorphism is associated with ACS risk in the Chinese Han population and the A allele of IL-8 -251 A/T may be an independent predictive factor for ACS. © 2011.

80053559507	Overexpression of cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes inhibits migration of vascular smooth muscle cells	Background: Loss of homeostasis in mature vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays an important role in senescence of blood vessel. However, the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Objective: To investigate the molecular mechanism by which cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) inhibits the migration of VSMCs. Methods: The pRc/CMV-CREG plasmid or the pSM2-siCREG plasmid was transferred into human VSMCs to produce the cell clone that overexpresses or downregulates CREG respectively. Cell scrape assay and Transwell assay were used to detect the migration of VSMCs. The CREG protein expression, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and JNK expression and activation in cells before and after transfection were detected by western blot analysis. The effect of above-mentioned signal molecule expression on VSMCs migration was analyzed through the use of JNK and MMP9 inhibitor. Results and Conclusion: Western blot analysis identified that CREG protein expression in hVSMCs-CREG cells increased (P < 0.05), but it was significantly decreased in the hVSMCs-siCREG cells (P < 0.05), compared with control ones. Cell scrape assay and Transwell assay results showed the migration of VSMCs was obviously inhibited in the hVSMCs-CREG group than in the normal control group. However, the migration of VSMCs in the hVSMCs-siCREG group was significantly increased (P < 0.05). Western blot analysis and gelatinase spectrum analysis showed that MMP9 activity in the hVSMCs-siCREG group was significantly increased (P < 0.05) and at the same time, JNK protein was activated. Blocking study using JNK inhibitor confirmed that CREG promoted VSMCs migration by regulating JNK and MMP9. Results showed that CREG protein expression can inhibit the migration of VSMCs cultured in vitro by inhibiting the activation of JNK and MMP9.

82555187963	Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes regulates vascular endothelial cell migration by The ILK/AKT/mTOR/VEGF 165 signaling pathway	The migration of vascular endothelial cells plays a critical role in a variety of vascular physiological and pathological processes, such as embryonic development, angiogenesis, wound healing, re-endothelialization, and vascular remodeling. This study clarified the role and mechanism of a new vascular homeostasis regulator, Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG), in the migration of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). A wound healing assay and transwell migration model showed that upregulation of CREG expression induced HUVEC migration and it was positively correlated with the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. Furthermore, wild type integrin-linked kinase reversed the poor mobility of CREG knock-down HUVECs; in contrast, kinase-dead integrin-linked kinase weakened the migration of HUVECs. We also studied the effect of CREG on HUVEC migration by the addition of an mTOR inhibitor, recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor

84862188064	Anti-atherosclerotic function of Astragali Radix extract: downregulation of adhesion molecules in vitro and in vivo	Background: Atherosclerosis is considered to be a chronic inflammatory disease. Astragali Radix extract (ARE) is one of the major active ingredients extracted from the root of Astragalus membranaceus Bge. Although ARE has an anti-inflammatory function, its anti-atherosclerotic effects and mechanisms have not yet been elucidated.Methods: Murine endothelial SVEC4-10 cells were pretreated with different doses of ARE at different times prior to induction with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Cell adhesion assays were performed using THP-1 cells and assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses to detect the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), phosphorylated inhibitor of κB (p-iκB) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB.

84863003156	Association of ALOX5AP haplotypes with susceptibility to coronary artery disease in a Chinese Han population	Background: The 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), encoded by the activating 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5AP) gene, is a crucial mediator of the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, which have been implicated in atherosclerosis. This study investigates whether ALOX5AP polymorphisms are associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in a Chinese Han population. Methods: The promoter, exons, splice site region and 3′-untranslated region of the ALOX5AP gene were sequenced in 48 subjects. Three polymorphic sites (- 1340T/G, + 8733T/C, + 20616G/C) found through sequencing were evaluated in 656 patients with angiographically proven CAD and 678 controls with normal coronary angiograms using a polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Allelic, genotypic linkage disequilibrium and haplotypic association testing were performed using SHEsis and LDA software. Binary logistic regression was used to control for the presence of vascular risk factors. Results: Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found through screening. No significant differences in allele carriers and genotype frequencies of the ALOX5AP polymorphisms were observed between the two groups. However, when the results of the three SNPs were combined, there was a significant association between two of the haplotypes and the risk of CAD. The haplotype GCG had a significantly greater frequency in patients than in controls (P < 0.001, OR = 1.728, 95%CI = 1.375-2.171), and the frequency of haplotype TCG was higher in controls (P < 0.001, OR = 0.623, 95%CI = 0.519-0.748). Conclusion: The data indicate that ALOX5AP gene variation is a genetic factor associated with interindividual differences in CAD risk. © 2012 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

84864658059	Construction of PTIE2-CREG-EGFP-N1 eukaryotic expression plasmid and its expression in mouse artery endothelial cells	BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanism of blood vessel endothelium formation is the primary premise for cellular and gene replacement therapy. OBJECTIVE: To construct an eukaryotic expression plasmid for cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) driven by an endothelial cell specific promoter TIE2 and reported by enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), and then to observe its expression in mouse artery endothelial cells in vitro. METHODS: TIE2 promoter DNA sequence was synthesized according to GenBank, and was attached with Ase I and Nhe I restriction enzyme recognition sites at both ends, respectively. The TIE2 promoter sequence was released from pUC57-TIE2 plasmid by Ase I and Nhe I digestion enzymes, and then was inserted into pEGFP-N1 plasmid to form pTIE2-EGFP-N1 recombinant plasmid. CREG gene fragment was released from pcDNA3.1 myc-His/hCREG plasmid by BamH I and EcoR I digestion enzymes, and then was subcloned into pTIE2-EGFP-N1 plasmid in order to construct pTIE2-CREG-EGFP-N1 plasmid. The recombinant pTIE2-CREG-EGFP-N1 plasmid was then transfected into mouse artery endothelial cells by liposome. The EGFP expression was observed by fluorescence microscopy and the CREG expression was detected by western blot analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Identification of pTIE2-CREG-EGFP-N1 by enzyme digestion and sequencing analysis showed that lengths of the target genes which were inserted into the recombinant plasmid were correct, and that the recombinant plasmid was transfected into mouse artery endothelial cells successfully. The strong expression of EGFP was observed by fluorescence microscopy, and the expression of CREG protein was detected by western blot analyis. The results showed that the pTIE2-CREG-EGFP-N1 eukaryotic expression plasmid was successfully constructed and the recombinant vector provides a practical tool in investigating the function and regulation of CREG in the development of cardiovascular diseases and also in producing transgenic mice with endothelial cell specific over-expression of CREG.

84864808651	Effective factors for regulating monolayer permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells	BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanism underlying exogenous stimulation-caused vascular barrier dysfunction remains poorly understood in the field of vascular pathophysiology. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effective factors for regulating monolayer permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and search for the effective treatment target. METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with and without specific inhibitors of RhoA and F-actin stress fibre. Changes in RhoA/SRF/F-actin activity in association with cell permeability and F-actin rearrangement signaling were investigated by immunostaining, transwell assay and western blot analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: When HUVECs were treated with LPS, F-actin cytoskeleton rearrangement was detected by rhodamine-phalloidin staining in a dose and time-dependent manner, meanwhile the HUVEC hyperpermeability was investigated. Furthermore, the RhoA activity and SRF translocalization into nuclei were identified to be associated with elevation of permeability in HUVECs. The effects were blocked when cells were pretreated with Y27632 or Latrunculin B, respectively. Moreover, Latrunculin B added also inhibited the translocalization of SRF into the nuclei mediated by RhoA activity. Our results have identified the RhoA/SRF and their substrates F-actin rearrangement mediated LPS-induced changes in HUVECs permeability.

84869491070	Cellular repressor E1A-stimulated genes controls phenotypic switching of adventitial fibroblasts by blocking p38MAPK activation	Aims: Phenotypic modulation of adventitial fibroblasts (AFs) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of proliferative vascular diseases. The current study aimed to identify the role of cellular repressor E1A-stimulated genes (CREG), a critical mediator in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis, in AF phenotypic modulation and adventitial remodeling. Method and results: Using in situ double-immunofluorescence staining, we ascertained that CREG expression was significantly down-regulated in the adventitia after vascular injury, and its expression pattern was conversely correlated with the expression of smooth muscle α-actin (α-SMA), a marker for differentiation of AFs into myofibroblasts. In vitro data confirmed the association of CREG in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AF differentiation. Additionally, overexpression of CREG attenuated Ang II-induced α-SMA expression in AFs. CREGoverexpressing AFs showed decreased levels of proliferation on days 2-5 following stimulation by Ang II compared with controls, with changes in the cell cycle profile as shown by BrdU incorporation assay and fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis. Moreover, wound healing assay and transwell migration model demonstrated that upregulation of CREG expression inhibited Ang II-induced AF migration. We found that CREG-mediated its counterbalancing effects in Ang II-induced phenotypic modulation, proliferation and migration by inhibition of the p38MAPK signaling pathway, validated by pharmacological blockade of p38MAPK with SB 203580 and by overexpression of p38MAPK with transfectants expressing constitutively active p38αMAPK. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that CREG is a novel AF phenotypic modulator in a p38MAPK-dependent manner.

84870208701	CREG: A possible candidate for both prevention and treatment of Proliferative vascular disease	Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG), a novel cellular protein, was discovered in 1998. Accumulating evidence, mainly from our laboratory, has suggested that CREG plays critical roles in reducing neointimal hyperplasia, maintaining vascular homeostasis, and promoting endothelial restoration. The study of CREG has the potential to offer new insights into both prevention and treatment of proliferative vascular disease, and will help us understand the processes of vascular repair after injury. It will also contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies and devices, such as anti-in-stent restenosis stents.

Methods: In vitro proliferation assays were performed using isolated human endothelial and smooth muscle cells to investigate the cell-specific pharmacokinetic effects of CREG and sirolimus. We implanted CREGES, control sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) or bare metal stents (BMS) into pig coronary arteries. Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess the efficacy of CREGES in inhibiting neointimal formation. Results: CREG and sirolimus inhibited in vitro vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation to a similar degree. Interestingly, human endothelial cell proliferation was only significantly inhibited by sirolimus and was increased by CREG. CREGES attenuated neointimal formation after 4 weeks in porcine coronary model compared with BMS. No differences were found in the injury and inflammation scores among the groups. Scanning electron microscopy and CD31 staining by immunohistochemistry demonstrated an accelerated reendothelialization in the CREGES group compared with the SES or BMS control groups. Conclusions: The current study suggests that CREGES reduces neointimal formation, promotes reendothelialization in porcine coronary stent model. © 2013 Deng et al.

84876089285	MicroRNA-31 controls phenotypic modulation of human vascular smooth muscle cells by regulating its target gene cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes	Phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of a variety of proliferative vascular diseases. The cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) has been shown to play an important role in phenotypic modulation of VSMCs. However, the mechanism regulating CREG upstream signaling remains unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been found to play a critical role in cell differentiation via target-gene regulation. This study aimed to identify a miRNA that binds directly to CREG, and may thus be involved in CREG-mediated VSMC phenotypic modulation. Computational analysis indicated that miR-31 bound to the CREG mRNA 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR). miR-31 was upregulated in quiescent differentiated VSMCs and downregulated in proliferative cells stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor and serum starvation, demonstrating a negative relationship with the VSMC differentiation marker genes, smooth muscle α-actin, calponin and CREG. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, CREG and VSMC differentiation marker gene expression levels were shown to be suppressed by a miR-31 mimic, but increased by a miR-31 inhibitor at both protein and mRNA levels. Notably, miR-31 overexpression or inhibition affected luciferase expression driven by the CREG 3'-UTR containing the miR-31 binding site. Furthermore, miR-31-mediated VSMC phenotypic modulation was inhibited in CREG-knockdown human VSMCs. We also determined miR-31 levels in the serum of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), with or without in stent restenosis and in healthy controls. miR-31 levels were higher in the serum of CAD patients with restenosis compared to CAD patients without restenosis and in healthy controls. In summary, these data demonstrate that miR-31 not only directly binds to its target gene CREG and modulates the VSMC phenotype through this interaction, but also can be an important biomarker in diseases involving VSMC phenotypic modulation. These novel findings may have extensive implications for the diagnosis and therapy of a variety of proliferative vascular diseases. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84880907304	The impact of gene polymorphism and high on-treatment platelet reactivity on clinical follow-up: Outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome after drug-eluting stent implantation	Aims: The current study sought to evaluate the clinical impact of newly reported genetic variations and their association with clopidogrel high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. Methods and results: The study enrolled 1,016 consecutive patients with ACS undergoing DES implantation. A total of 19 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from CYP3A4/5, CYP2C19, P2Y12 and ABCB1 genes. ADP-induced light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) was performed to test the post-procedure maximum platelet agglutination (MPA). The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), stent thrombosis, and ischaemic stroke at one-year follow-up after DES placement. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of bleeding events. The post-procedure MPA was calculated and the cut-off point was determined for the HTPR. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, the carriage of two CYP2C19 LOF alleles was an independent predictor of the post-procedure HTPR (OR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.70-7.23, p<0.001). Through multivariate Cox regression analysis, the carriage of two CYP2C19 LOF alleles and the post-procedure HTPR were independent predictors of the primary endpoint (HR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.40-4.97, p<0.001; HR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.52-5.57, p<0.001, respectively). However, post-procedure MPA did not predict a bleeding event (HR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.44-1.59, p=0.532). Conclusions: In patients with ACS, the CYP2C19 LOF allele was associated with post-procedure HTPR and a subsequently increased risk of adverse clinical events at one-year follow-up following DES implantation and clopidogrel administration. © Europa Digital and Publishing 2013.

84883658312	Creg promotes the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells through the ERK/cyclin E signaling pathway	Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) is a recently discovered secreted glycoprotein involved in homeostatic modulation. We previously reported that CREG is abundantly expressed in the adult vascular endothelium and dramatically downregulated in atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, CREG participates in the regulation of apoptosis, inflammation and wound healing of vascular endothelial cells. In the present study, we attempted to investigate the effect of CREG on the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms. Overexpression of CREG in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was obtained by infection with adenovirus carrying CREG. HUVEC proliferation was investigated by flow cytometry and 5-bromo-2′-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation assays. The expressions of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases and signaling molecules were also examined. In CREG-overexpressing cells, we observed a marked increase in the proportion of the S and G2 population and a decrease in the G0/G1 phase population. The number of BrdU positively-stained cells also increased, obviously. Furthermore, silencing of CREG expression by specific short hairpin RNA effectively inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). CREG overexpression induced the expression of cyclin E in both protein and mRNA levels to regulate cell cycle progression. Further investigation using inhibitor blocking analysis identified that ERK activation mediated the CREG modulation of the proliferation and cyclin E expression in HUVEC. In addition, blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in CREG-overexpressed HUVEC and supplementation of VEGF in CREG knocked-down HUVEC identified that the pro-proliferative effect of CREG was partially mediated by VEGF-induced ERK/cyclin E activation. These results suggest a novel role of CREG to promote HUVEC proliferation through the ERK/cyclin E signaling pathway. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

0042315219	Studies of TGF-β/Smads expression in lung cancer	Smad proteins transduce signals from transforming growth factor beta superfamily ligands that regulate cell proliferation, differention and death through activation of receptor serine/threonine kinases. TGF-β/Smads signal pathway not only has transforming potential but can also drive tumourigenesis, malignant progression, invasion and metastasis of human cancers. Using the immunohistochemistry, we investigate the expression and location of TGF-βR II, Smad2 Smad4 and Smad7 in 20 lung cancer specimens and 8 lung cancer cell lines. The results suggest that aberrant smads protein expression is significantly related to lung cancer tumoruigenesis and progression. Interestingly, TGF-βR II and Smad7 strongly express in high metastasis cell lines. High expression of TGF-βR II and smad7 in the cell lines with high-metastatic potential showed a conceivable TGF-β signal pathway independent Smads in the lung cancer, and that might mediate invasion and metastasis of lung cancer.

0142043514	Research on expression and control of p 16 and p 21 by wild-type p 53 gene in two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines	Objective: To evaluate the potentinal of p53 gene therapy for lung cancer in nude mice. Methods: Two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines L-18 and 95D were infected with adenovirus encoding wild-type p53 gene pAdCMV-p53(Ad-p53) in vitro and in vivo. The antitumor effect of wild-type p53 gene was assessed by cell growth curve, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and TUNEL staining methods. Results: The p53-specific growth inhibition and apoptosis of tumor cells were observed in both cell lines in vitro. By RT-PCR analysis, the increasing expression of p21 gene but not of p16 gene after p53 gene infection suggested that p21 gene played an important role in p53 gene induced cell apoptosis. The in vivo study revealed that celiac injection of p53 gene significantly inhibited the tumorigenesis in 95D and L-18 cells in nude mice. However, no obvious inhibition of tumorigenesis was observed after subcutaneous injection of p53 gene in L-18 cell line, compared with the inhibition noted in 95D cell line. Conclusion: The results showed the adenovirus-mediated antitumor therapy by means of p53 gene infection might be a potential way to inhibit cancer growth and induce tumor cell apoptosis.

84892567116	The TGFB1 functional polymorphism rs1800469 and susceptibility to atrial fibrillation in two Chinese Han populations	Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is related to the degree of atrial fibrosis and plays critical roles in the induction and perpetuation of atrial fibrillation (AF). To investigate the association of the common promoter polymorphism rs1800469 in the TGF-β1 gene (TGFB1) with the risk of AF in Chinese Han population, we carried out a case-control study of two hospital-based independent populations: Southeast Chinese population (581 patients with AF and 723 controls), and Northeast Chinese population (308 AF patients and 292 controls). Two hundred and seventy-eight cases of AF were lone AF and 334 cases of AF were diagnosed as paroxysmal AF. In both populations, AF patients had larger left atrial diameters than the controls did. The rs1800469 genotypes in the TGFB1 gene were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotype and allele frequencies of rs1800469 were not different between AF patients and controls of the Southeast Chinese population, Northeast Chinese population, and total Study Population. After adjustment for age, sex, hypertension and LAD, there was no association between the rs1800469 polymorphism and the risk of AF under the dominant, recessive and additive genetic models. Similar results were obtained from subanalysis of the lone and paroxymal AF subgroups. Our results do not support the role of the TGFB1 rs1800469 functional gene variant in the development of AF in the Chinese Han population. © 2013 Zheng et al.

84901201111	Association between the -786T>C 1polymorphism in the promoter region of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and risk of coronary artery disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Background: A variety of studies have evaluated the association between the 786T>C polymorphism in the promoter region of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the results remain conflicting. To better understand the role of eNOS 786T>C polymorphism in CAD risk, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Case-control, cohort or cross-sectional studies evaluating the association between eNOS 786T>C polymorphism and CAD risk were searched in electronic databases of PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Medline, Embase and Google Scholar Search (up to January 2013). Overall and subgroup analyses were performed. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to evaluate the association between eNOS 786T>C polymorphism and CAD risk. Statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.0 and STATA12.0. Results: Twenty-four studies were analyzed between 6192 CAD cases and 9281 healthy controls. The combined results of overall analysis showed significant positive associations between CAD risk and eNOS 786T>C polymorphism in dominant model (OR=1.45, 95% CI=1.27-1.65), recessive model (OR=1.37, 95% CI=1.20-1.56), homozygote comparison (OR=1.64, 95% CI=1.31-2.04), heterozygote comparison (TC vs. TT, OR=1.39, 95% CI=1.23-1.57; CC vs. TC, OR=1.20, 95% CI=1.04-1.37) and allele comparison (OR=1.35, 95% CI=1.21-1.50). On subgroup analysis based on the ethnicity of population (Caucasians, Asians and others), significant differences were found in all genetic models for Caucasians, similar associations existed in Asians except heterozygote comparison (CC vs. TC). However, the associations were only found in dominant model, heterozygote comparison (TC vs. TT) and allele comparison for the populations named others. Conclusions: Our investigations demonstrate the significant associations between eNOS 786C>T polymorphism and CAD risk, and this polymorphism might become an early marker for the risk evaluation of CAD. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84904555511	CREG1 promotes angiogenesis and neovascularization	Angiogenesis has long been considered as an important strategy for ischemic injury. It has been reported that cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG1) promotes human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation, migration, and protects endothelial cell (EC) from apoptosis. However, its potential effect on angiogenesis remains undefined. In the present study, we investigated the role and mechanisms of CREG1 in promoting angiogenesis. We found that adenovirus-transduced CREG1 expression in HUVECs increases EC tube formation in matrigel and promotes neovascularization in matrigel plugs grafted into wild type mice. In addition, adenoviral CREG1 expression enhances filopodia formation, which is accompanied by increased expression of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and activation of its downstream effector Cdc42. Hindlimb perfusion was significantly reduced after femoral artery ligation in CREG1 heterozygous knockout mice. Finally, adenoviral CREG1 was injected intramuscularly in gastrochemius and partially restores ischemic hindlimb perfusion. Our results demonstrated that CREG1 increases EC filopodia formation and vascular assembly via ILK-Cdc42 activation and promotes neovascularization, which might be a therapeutic target for ischemic injury.

84904567591	CREG promotes vasculogenesis By activation of VEGF/PI3K/Akt pathway	Knowledge about factors regulating vasculogenesis remains limited. The cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated gene (CREG) has been reported to be involved in maintaining cellular differentiation and endothelial homeostasis, thus we hypothesize that CREG may be a novel factor regulating vasculogenesis. By using mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) derived embryoid body (EB) model, we confirmed expression of CREG was significantly up-regulated during EB differentiation. Overexpression of CREG in ESC led to accelerated cystic EB formation, increased endothelial differentiation and vasculogenesis, whereas knockdown of CREG produced opposite phenotypes. Moreover, we found expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was upregulated and PI3K/Akt pathway was activated in CREG-overexpressing EB. Administration of VEGF neutralizing antibody or PI3K/Akt pharmacological inhibitor LY294002 blocked the vasculogenesis in CREG over-expressing EB, while supplement of VEGF rescued vasculogenesis deficiency in CREG knocked down EB. Further study by Western blot determined that PI3K/Akt was a downstream effector of VEGF. We identify CREG as a novel factor in regulating endothelial differentiation and vasculogenesis via VEGF/PI3K/Akt pathway.

84910123291	Association between SNP rs13376333 and rs1131820 in the KCNN3 gene and atrial fibrillation in the Chinese Han population	Background: The small conductance calcium-activated potassium, subfamily N, member 3 (KCNN3) gene rs13376333 and rs1131820 have been shown to be strongly associated with lone atrial fibrillation (AF), while replication association studies between rs13376333 in KCNN3 gene and risk of AF showed conflicting results. The current study tried to validate the impact of SNP rs13376333 and rs1131820 of KCNN3 gene on the risk of AF in the Chinese Han population. Methods: A total of 889 AF patients and 1015 controls were enrolled. Two hundred and seventy-eight cases of AF were lone AF. KCNN3 gene SNP rs13376333 and rs1131820 were genotyped by allele-specific MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Results: The genotype distribution and allele frequency of rs13376333 polymorphism were not different between total AF patients and controls. However, the genotype distribution of rs13376333 polymorphism was significantly different between lone AF and control group (p<0.001); and T allele frequency was significantly higher in lone AF group than that in controls (7.6% vs 3.6%, p<0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that T allele carriers of rs13376333 was significantly associated with lone AF (OR=2.31, 95% CI 1.41-3.78, p=0.001). No relationship between rs1131820 polymorphism and total AF or lone AF was found in this study. Conclusions: KCNN3 rs13376333 polymorphism was associated with lone AF in the Chinese Han population and the T allele carriers may be an independent predictive factor for lone AF.
