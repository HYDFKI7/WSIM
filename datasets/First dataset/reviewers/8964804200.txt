17844374350	Performance gradation and performance safe index of structures in seismic design	According to the damage degree of structures, the damage state can be divided into five levels as:nearly intact, minor damage, moderate damage, serious damage and collapse. Based on the five levels, the performance limit states are divided into four stages: the function consecutive limit state, the damage control limit state, the loss control limit state and the collapse prevention limit state, and the division criteria of structural performance are established. The safe index of design performance is defined as the negative natural logarithm of structural failure probability in this paper. The safe grade of design performance is got by calculating the one-order partial derivative of the structural failure probability to the reliable indication of every structural element. Because the method can consider the performance of the building structural elements, the building non-structural elements and other non-structural elements, as well as the effect of the whole structure, the safe index of design performance can relatively reflect the seismic performance gradation.

33748687425	Seismic behavior of reinforced concrete frame columns with excessive axial compression ratios	Discussions are presented on t he relationships between the average, standard and design values of reinforcing steel bars, concrete, and stirrup parameters and axial compression ratios. A calculation formula is derived for the relationship between the limiting axial compression ratio for frame columns and the relative compression region height in sectional limit disruptive. From the test results of 26 columns subjected to constant axial load and horizontal low-frequency cyclic load with excessive axial compression ratios, we have analyzed the effects of axial compression ratio, stirrup parameters, geometry of section, concrete strength grade, shear span-to-depth ratio, etc., on the skeleton curves, hysteretic curves, ductility and limit drift ratios of the frame columns. Based on the test results, the limit values of axial compression ratio for reinforced concrete frame columns are proposed. Moreover, from the test results of 31 reinforced concrete frame columns, a regression formula is developed in terms of several parameters, namely, the ductility, limit drift ratio, axial compression ratio, and stirrup parameter. It was found that the proposed minimum stirrup parameters in the intensified stirrup region of seismic frame columns with excessive axial compression ratios are confirmed by using the regression formula, this is consistent with the new design code.

The finite element method is used to simulate the dynamic response of a simply supported reinforced concrete bridge, under the vehicle load spectrum. The time-displacement history of the bridge is obtained, and the effect of automobile speed on the dynamic coefficient is studied.

33749019688	A study on the seismic behavior of and the design method for irregular reinforced concrete frame joints of large-scale plant structures	Large-scale plants commonly involve irregular structural joints consisting of beams and columns with abrupt cross-sectional changes. Pseudo-static structural tests on four 1/5-scale specimens have been performed and the failure characteristics of these specimens were investigated. The factors affecting failure modes of irregular joints were found to be the stiffness ratio of large beam to small beam, the areas of large core and small core, and the stirrup ratios of small core and column, etc. The experimental results showed that the cracking load and the ultimate load of irregular joints obviously decrease when compared with regular joints, and that the penetrating crack load is very close to the ultimate load. Moreover, two typical failure modes may occur simultaneously, namely, they are the small core shear failure and column shear failure. A constraint mechanism method was employed to express the small core shear failure and an empirical formula for calculating shear-bearing capacity of irregular joints are is thus proposed. The steel ratio at the bottom of a large beam should be restricted to avoid possible column failure in shear. Further, the bending moment ratio of a small beam to large beam may be employed to distinguish the failure modes of irregular joints.

The structure was design for similar requirements in accordance with the GBJ11-89, and their 1:7 scaled models were subjected to pseudo-dynamic and pseudo-static loadings. Experimental results show that structure exhibited a rather uniformly distributed cracking pattern. Plastic hinges appeared to also occur in several columns, and this may be attributed to the 'strong beam and soft column'. The severe damage at the fifth story of prototype is attributable to the abrupt reduction of the column cross section size and abnormal joints effects.

The members were tested with the shear span-effctive depth ratio ranging from 0.26 to 1.04 and the span-depth ratio as 2 and 3, respectively. The failure process, load-midspan deflection curves, the failure mode and the strain of steels were analyzed. The shear behaviors of eight specimens were calculated using the code for design of concrete structures (GB 50010-2010), and then the calculation results were compared with the predictions based on the ACI code, CSA code and EC2 code, in which the strut-and-tie model is utilized. Results show that there are two typical failure patterns for deep flexural specimens made of high-strength lightweight aggregate concrete, that is, the shear failure and flexural-shear failure. With the increase of shear span-effctive depth ratio, the ultimate shear behavior of specimens decreased significantly and the bending effect became more apparent. It was shown that with the increase of shear span-effctive depth ratio and span-depth ratio, the failure modes changed gradually from the shear failure to the flexural-shear failure. The strut-and-tie model is reasonable since the calculation results using the strut-and-tie model agreed well with the test results, while compared to the strut-and-tie model, the calculation results using the code in China are more conservative, especially for the deep flexural beam with the span-depth ratio as 2.

Five one-third-scale simply supported RC T-beams were tested during this study.

78149371211	Experimental research on seismic behavior of irregular interior joints in RC frame structure	According to the experimental investigation on ten 1/3-scale RC frame specimens with irregular interior joints under low cyclic reversed loading, the failure process and failure patterns were obtained. The failure characteristics, mechanical behaviors of the irregular interior joints such as the load displacement hysteretic loops, rigidity deterioration and energy dissipation were analyzed. The experimental study was conducted focusing on the effect of joint core dimensions, hoop percentage and axial compression ratio on seismic behavior of irregular interior joints. Test results indicate that the first crack appeares in the minor core(determined by the low beam and the top column), and the final failure appears in the large core(determined by the high beam and the bottom column). The critical crack load is quite same value as the ultimate load of the irregular interior joints. The load displacement hysteretic loops of low beam and high beam are quite different each other, the hysteretic loops of all the high beams show a reversed S-shape exhibited sever pinching with little energy dissipation. On the contrary, those of the low beams show a hooked end shape with improved energy dissipation. The seismic behavior of the beam-column joint subassemblage is significantly influenced by the dimensions of low beams, and this poor behavior of the beam-column joint subassemblage is due to formation of the diagonal tension cracks within the joint core region, inadequate confinement to the concrete and the significant bond deterioration along the beam bars through the joints. The reinforcing details of the test specimen, which are designed under the guideline of current codes, can not preserve the structural integrity and satisfy the strong joint demand.

78651395342	Equivalent ductility damage model for seismic response of RC structures: Test and verification	It is possible to quantify the damage to reinforced concrete members under cyclic loading through a nondimensional parameter known as a "damage index". The damage index can be either a global damage index for the total structure, or a local damage index for the element level. In this paper, a new damage model termed "equivalent ductility damage model" has been suggested for evaluation of the damage index, which is consistent with accepted definitions of ductility. Substructure method was applied to verify the suggested new damage model. A total of 3 identical half-scale reinforced concrete columns were tested under variable amplitude cyclic loading up to the ultimate failure of the specimens. The imposed displacement histories were obtained from analytical simulations of the model column subjected to a series of earthquakes. Test observations indicate that the proposed model predicts 100 percent damage at the ultimate failure state of the element. The proposed damage index model can be extended to other structural elements, such as shear walls, beams, beam-column junctions, etc. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

79551690650	Comparative analysis of seismic damage models for reinforced concrete bridge piers	Damage indices have the potential to play vital role in defining performance objectives and retrofit decision-making in earthquake regions with the development of performance based seismic design theory recently. However, a major limitation of existing indices is that they have been formulated and validated almost exclusively on the basis of building structures, neglecting bridge structures. In this paper, eight damage indices are evaluated by comparison of a series of bridge pier tests. On the basis of these comparisons, it appears that the indices which attempt to take account of the damage caused by repeated cycling give no more reliable indication of damage. The Park&Ang model provides a more reliable indication of the various damage levels. The Liu model which takes account of low-cyclic fatigue has clear concept and is easy for application.

The experimental study was conducted by focusing on the influence of joint core dimensions and axial compression ratio on crack resistance of interior joints. Test results indicate that the column axial load fluctuates from time to time because of the unbalanced force occurred in the beam-column subassemblage due to the significant difference on stiffness between the deeper beam and the shallow beam. Based on the test results, a theoretical expression of influencing factors α was put forward. Furthermore, a theoretical formula of crack resistance capacity of beam-column joints (including ordinary interior joints, exterior joints, wide flat beam-column joints and joints with different depth beams) was proposed in this study.

79955659325	Analysis of stiffness and cracks of shear strengthened beam with stainless steel wire mesh and polymer mortar	Experiments were conducted to investigate the shear behavior of nine RC rectangular beams strengthened with stainless steel wire mesh and permeability polymer mortar. The influences on the stiffness and cracks were discussed, including strengthening mode, bolt amount, bolt distance, and secondary load. The test results show that the rehabilitation can greatly increase the beam stiffness, reduce the width of diagonal cracks, and postpone the occurrence of diagonal cracks. Too many or too dense bolts would badly weaken the stiffness of the beam. Internal fractures occurred on the top of the beam strengthened with U-shape and may develop debonding failure, but horizontal critical cracks formed on the top and bottom of the beam strengthened at four sides and may also develop debonding failure. The range of increase of the beam stiffness is lower and the development of diagonal cracks is faster if the secondary load is larger. The rehabilitation effects on the beams are remarkable. Based on the experiments and theoretical analysis, the methods for calculation of the deflection and the width of diagonal cracks are proposed.

The mechanism of the double-row anti-slide piles were analyzed with the help of Marc program. The influencing factors were analyzed, which included the pile-soil interaction, the pile's rigidity, the crossbeam's rigidity, the length of the double-row piles and their distance. The results show that with the reduce of the soil's strength, the part of the front pile which has contact with the soil directly extends to the top of the pile, but the part of the back pile which has contact with the soil directly shrinks from the top of the pile. The tensile stresses of the upper half of the front pile are bigger. Especially on the root of the slope the tensile stresses reach the biggest. But the biggest tensile stresses of the back pile lie on the 14 m to 15 m from its top. The ratio of the biggest tensile stresses of the front pile and the back pile is about 3/2. When calculating the capability, the bending moment can be proportional distributed with 3/2. The height of the tie beam on the pile top is about 60% to 70% of the pile's diameter. The distance between the front pile with the back pile is about 1.5 to 2 times of the pile's diameter.

80053536491	Parameter study on shear behavior of RC interior joints with different depth beams using equivalent strut mechanism	Based on the experimental study, the failure characteristics and failure process of interior joints are analyzed. An equivalent strut mechanism for this type of joint is proposed, and it is assumed that the strength of the joint is provided by an equivalent diagonal compression strut, in which the concrete stress reaching its maximum compression strength is the mark of joint failure. Based on equivalent strut mechanism, the influence of the different depth beam and the compression strength of concrete on the shear behavior of joints was analyzed. The results indicated that: the different depth beam was a key factor that influences the shear behavior of joints; when the compression strength of concrete increased, the joints shear capacity increased obviously; when the compression strength of concrete exceeded 50 MPa, the joints shear capacity increased slowly. The shear capacity of joints reached the maximum when the different depth beam height equaled to 0.9 times the column section height. Furthermore, when the different depth beam height was more than the column section height, the different beam joints were treated as the exterior joints.

80055068081	Failure mechanism of reinforced concrete interior joints with variable depth beams	Ten specimens of interior joints with variable depth beams were tested under reversed cyclic loading. The failure characteristics and failure process of the interior joint specimens were analyzed. Test results indicate that the through-section cracking stage is quite similar to the ultimate loading stage of the irregular interior joints. The shear deformation of joint core increases greatly after the specimens reach the through-section cracking stage. Strength degradation and stiffness degradation of the test specimens obliviously occur too. At failure the joint diagonal cracks mainly concentrate within 2/3 of the greater core zone (joint of the column and girder) in the direction parallel with the diagonal line of the joint. The test specimens which were designed under the guideline of current code can not ensure the structural integrity and satisfy the strong joint demand. By developing the diagonal strut mechanism and the truss mechanism, an equivalent strut mechanism for this type joint is proposed. In addition, the curves of shear stress versus shear angle of the joint core of tested specimens were calculated using equivalent diagonal compression strut.

Furthermore, the suggested analytical model was verified using the data from 108 tests of beam-column joints (including ordinary interior joints, exterior joints, and joints with variable depth beams). Good agreement between the experimental results and predicted results was achieved. In addition, study results indicate that the joint shear bearing capacity calculated by the suggested simplified model agrees well with that by the code method. Since the suggested simplified method has a more explicit mechanical basis, it can reasonable reveal the failure mechanism of the beam-to-column joint.

Based on experiments and theory analysis, the design formulae of shear capacity were proposed. The test results show that the rehabilitation greatly increases the beam's shear load-carrying capacity. Too much and dense bolts badly weaken the shear behavior of beam itself. The influences of the strengthening manners on the load capacity are puny, and the beams' failure modes and the utilization ratio of stainless steel wire are remarkably different. The increasing range of the beam's load-carrying capacity is lower if its secondary load is bigger. But the rehabilitation effects of the failure beams are remarkable.

The influence of post-yield stiffness and floor yield strength coefficient of structures on the dynamic behavior of structural response is studied based on a large number of time-history analyses. Other influence factors, such as site category, basic period, are also addressed in this paper. The analytical results show that the influence of the site category on collapse response is determined by its contribution to earthquake wave amplitude, frequency spectrum and duration. The negative stiffness of post-yielded structure has a significant influence on the collapse response of structures. By using the floor yield strength coefficient, structures are categorized into three types: strong, moderate and weak. For the strong structure, it is easy to ensure the safety under the rare earthquake; for the weak structure, the story drift can be checked following the current code; and for the moderate structure, the method suggested in this paper can be utilized to check the equivalent ductility considering low-cyclic fatigue characteristic and ensure the safety under the rare earthquake. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

The formulas of the flexural bearing capacity, the flexural rigidity, and the crack width were proposed, with considering the influence of first load, secondary load, the magnitude of sustained load, quantity and style of the reinforcement, and concrete strength. The calculated values were compared with tested values. The results indicate that the reinforcement included high strength stainless steel strand, reinforcing mesh and steel wire mesh. Their mechanical performances were significantly different, but the flexural behavior and failure mechanism of these beams strengthened with the reinforcement were the same.

The results indicate that the failure process of reinforced concrete columns can be divided into three stages: damage rapid development stage, stalemate stage, and failure stage. The stiffness degradation traces and rigidity deterioration traces are accompanied with the failure process. The reason lies in the essential feature of elastic-plastic behavior of member and the development of damage. In addition, the energy dissipation is related to the loading path and is influenced by the crack development and crack distribution of column. 2 tabs, 9 figs, 13 refs.

The calculation model of debonding bearing capacity at the plate-end of beam strengthened with high strength steel wire mesh was established. The debonding failure at the middle part of strengthened beam was taken as research object, the middle part between two nearby flexural cracks of RC beam was regarded as arithmetic element, the stress condition of steel wire mesh was analyzed, and the calculation models of bonding shear stress and debonding normal stress at the middle part of strengthened beam were deduced. The debonding criteria at the middle part of strengthened beam were proposed, and the models were validated. Analysis result indicates that the upper limit of the calculation model of debonding bearing capacity at plate-end equals 0.57, it is in accordance with test result. The difference between the value calculated by the model of debonding bearing capacity at the middle part and test result is approximately 3.77%, so the calculation model is feasible.

84880909681	Shear behavior of RC irregular interior joints using simplified softened strut-and-tie model	Based on the experimental study, an analytical model for equivalent joint core of frame joint under the combined action of axial load and shear is established, and the shear strength of equivalent joint core of tested specimens is calculated by using softened strut and tie model(STM). Results indicate that the calculated shear strength of STM is quite nearly with that of code method, but STM has more definite mechanical model. Thus, full agreement between experimental results and prediction results of STM is reached. Based on the softened strut and tie model, the effect of axial compression ratio on seismic behavior of irregular interior joints is also discussed.

84882786019	The research and calculation on modified Park-Ang double parameter seismic damage model based on energy dissipation	The Park-Ang double parameter seismic damage model has been widely used due to the consideration of first exceedance failure and cumulative damage failure in terms of defining the structural damage under earthquake. However, it does not consider the differences between structural failures with different displacement amplitudes. Based on past experimental research, the damage properties of the reinforced concrete columns under different displacement amplitudes were mainly analyzed, and the relationship between the structure damage and the structural energy dissipation was studied. Past experiments indicated the specimens scarcely failed during the elastic stage, but failed when more energy obsorbed during the developing and fail stage. In this study, effective energy dissipation is proposed instead of using hysteric energy dissipation when describing the cause of structural damage during the inelastic stage. It is suggested that the hysteric energy dissipation during the non-elastic stage is termed as the effective energy dissipation that causes structure failure. Based on the assumption of effective energe dissipation, the effective energy dissipation factor is introduced and a modified Park-Ang double-parameter seismic damage model is proposed. The proposed model is verified by the test data of 21groups of reinforced concrete columns. With the same dissipated energy, the effective energy dissipation factor is proved to show the differences between the structural failures led by different displacement amplitudes. The Definition of the effective energy dissipation factor is thusly explicit, the double parameter seismic damage model is improved with higher computational accuracy and less discreteness, it also tell the failure differences between the reinforced concrete columns under different displacement amplitudes and evaluate the damage level of the RC structure well.

84883622728	Development and application of material constitutive models based on ABAQUS/explicit beam elements	The current status of steel and concrete uniaxial constitutive models was reviewed briefly. Based on the former research, constitutive models of steel and concrete were presented, which can consider the Bauschinger effect and stiffness degradation of steel, the strength and stiffness degradation of concrete under arbitrarily cyclic loading. Also, modeling methods of reinforced concrete beam elements and some measures using an explicit method for static and dynamic analyses were discussed at length. According to the demand of ABAQUS/Explicit package's VUMAT pattern, a user subroutine for fiber beam elements written in FORTRAN language was developed. By means of the comparison with the pseudo-static test and full scale shaking table test results, the reliability of user subroutine, also, modeling methods were validated. The results show that the user subroutine proposed here are applicable to refined the simulation of normal- and high-strength concrete beams & columns or other components characterized by flexural failure in complex large-scale structures widely.

84884488019	Shear strength of reinforced concrete frame joints using Modified Softened Strut-and-Tie model	For the shear analysis of interior joints of a reinforced concrete structure by using a Softened Strut-and-Tie model, the effective joint width can always be taken as the whole column width empirically. However, for the frame joint with a cast-in situ slab, the effective joint width is not equal to each other at the top and bottom of a beam column interface. Additionally, the effective joint width also gets wider with the increasing compression stress and ends at the location of crushing. A Modified Softened Strut-and-Tie (MSST) model suggested a more rational calculation method for effective joint width. The shear strength of existing tested 63 interior joints was calculated by Using the Modified Softened Strut-and-Tie model. Furthermore, the theory results were compared with those of the Softened Strut-and-Tie model and those of the code method. The results indicated that the Modified Softened Strut-and-Tie can more precisely predict the joint shear strength than that of the Softened Strut-and-Tie model; Furthermore, the results also indicated that the shear strength of joint core calculated by an MSST model is quite nearly with that of the code method. Thus, the MSST model can reasonable reveal the failure mechanism of beam-column-slab joints.

84884856689	The research on modified Park-Ang damage model based on effective energy dissipation	Collapse of buildings in earthquakes causes casualties and economic losses, the reinforced concrete columns damage models is a basis for the research of integer collapse. The major advantage of Park and Ang's method is the consideration of first exceedance failure and cumulative damage failure in terms of defining the structural damage under earthquake, however, it isn't consider the differences of structural failures by different displacement amplitudes and load sequence. By multiplying the effective energy dissipation factor and the load sequence factor, the modified Park-Ang seismic damage model is obtained. The comparison between the two models indicates that the modified Park-Ang model have mean value closer to 1 and smaller scatter, besides the effects of load path and load sequence on damage can be taken into account in the modified model. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84885093293	Development and application of material constitutive models based on ABAQUS/Standard beam elements	In order to use the beam element of ABAQUS for analyzing reinforced concrete members, a steel rebar and concrete constitutive models were presented based on the former research. According to UMAT interface provided by the software, a user subroutine of steel rebar and concrete written in FORTRAN language was developed for fiber beam element. Moreover, modeling methods of reinforced concrete beam element by ABAQUS were discussed at length. By means of comparison with low cycle and iterative static test and full scale shaking table test results, reliabilities of the user subroutine and modeling methods were validated. The results show that the subroutine provided here can well reflect strength and stiffness degradation of reinforced concrete columns produced by arbitrarily cyclic loading both in tension and compression. The subroutine is widely applicable to refined simulation of normal-and high-strength concrete beams and columns or other members characterized by flexural failure in complex large-scale structures widely.

84887538244	Modeling and its application of reinforced concrete columns considering nonlinear shear effects	A fiber beam-column element in conjunction with zero-length elements attached to its ends was proposed to simulate the flexural and shear mechanism respectively. Based on the Limit State Material model and the Shear Limit Curve model provided by OpenSees, the nonlinear shear effect of reinforced concrete column and its coupling with the flexural effect were defined. The reliability of the proposed model was validated by means ofcomparisons with existing test results. Finally, a plane frame from in-situ pushover test was simulated. It is shown that the proposed method, by taking the nonlinear shear effect into account, produces satisfactory results for frame columns with shear strength and stiffness degradation, while the conventional fiber beam-column element can hardly simulate actual flexure-shear failure mechanism for columns characterized by insufficient transverse reinforcement. The proposed method is applicable for nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete frame structures with shear deficiencies.

84890228258	Protective performance of masonry walls strengthened with polymer sheet under explosive loading	Based on explosion tests of concrete masonry walls, the failure mechanism of concrete masonry walls and the protective performance of masonry walls strengthened with polymer sheet were analyzed. The results showed that the dangerous cross sections of a masonry wall are located in mid-span at its back and upper and lower ends facing to explosion; when the peak pressure of explosive loading does not exceed 0.385MPa, the blocks detaching from the wall and launching into a building are less, the wall should not be strengthened with polymer sheet; when the peak pressure exceeds 0.385MPa, the number of the blocks detaching from the wall increases with increase in the peak pressure, and the flying speeds rise too, and the threat against persons and equipments in the building grows, so the wall should be strengthened; when the peak pressure does not exceed 0.95MPa, polymer sheet can effectively work and hinder the cracked masonry from blocking; when the peak pressure exceeds 0.95MPa, polymer sheet breaks at anchorages, and the broken ploymer sheet launchs into the building with the broken wall, so a cable-membrane protective system should be installed to enhance the safety; the safe protection distance of the concrete masonry wall strengthened with polymer sheet is given. All results provided a reference for design.

84888379865	Design method of steel reinforced concrete shear walls	A quasi-static test was carried out about eight specimens with the shear span ratio being 2.5. The failure mechanism, hysteretic behavior, deformability and energy dissipation capacity were analyzed by changing the axial load ratio, steel ratio and stirrup characteristic value. Based on the test results, the design method of steel reinforced concrete shear walls was researched. Considering the plane-section assumption and confinement of concrete in confined zone, the stress distribution and strain distribution along the wall section at yield state and ultimate state were proposed. The yield load bearing capacity and ultimate load bearing capacity formula were developed. The relationships between top lateral displacement ratio and cross section's curvature, and plastic hinge length were theoretically deduced. The deformation capacity of structural walls was recommended. The stirrup characteristic value and the length of confined zone were put forward. The results show that the crash of concrete at base leads to failure of the walls. The SRC structural walls have the plump hysteretic curves and no significant pinch phenomenon. The reliability of the method is verified through the comparison of the analysis results and the experimental results.

84890467361	Seismic behavior and design method of abnormal exterior joints in large-scale thermal power plant	The large-scale thermal power plant main building commonly contained the abnormal exterior joints with the high beam and column section abrupt. Four 1/5 scale plane abnormal exterior joints and one space abnormal joint of reinforced concrete frame were tested in this paper. The factors affecting the shear failure mode of abnormal joints such as: transverse beam, the column section abrupt, the stirrup ratio of joints etc. were presented. The experimental results indicated the abnormal joints crack load and the ultimate load decreased significantly contrast to those of ordinary joints. Furthermore, crack load were very closed to ultimate load and two typical failure modes were presented: minor core shear failure and the joint zone (under transverse beam) shear failure. Using the confine mechanism to express the minor core shear failure and the formula for calculation of the shear capacity for abnormal joints were given. Restraining the steel ratio on the bottom of high beam was effective to ensure the safety of the joint zone under transverse beam.

84890481177	Study on flexural behavior of RC T-beams strengthened with Wire Cable Mesh and Polymer Mortar	Rehabilitation of RC members with Wire Cable Mesh and Polymer Mortar is a new method of structural strengthening with the advantages of resistance to fire and corrosion. Additionally, the advantages of this technique are that the work can be carried out while the structure is still in use and it is economical compared to other methods. The experiments on the flexural behaviour of RC T-beams strengthened with Wire Cable Mesh and Polymer Mortar were presented in this study. The objective of this investigation is to concentrate on increasing the flexural capacity of strengthened T-beams and its failure modes.

84896055741	Critical dosage of high strength steel wire mesh for strengthened RC beams	For researching the ultimate bearing capacity and critical dosage of strength steel wire mesh of strengthened members, based on the experimental study, the finite element models were established to analyze the critical dosage of high strength steel wire mesh for strengthened RC beams. The stress states of normal section and inclined section of the strengthened beam were analyzed and the formulas were proposed to calculate the critical dosage of high strength steel wire mesh, including the calculation methods for the maximal dosage and the minimal dosage at the two aspects, flexural behavior and shear behavior. The results show that the calculated maximal dosage of high strength steel wire mesh of flexural strengthened RC beams is about 0.80 of the practical maximal dosage, which can ensure the necessary ductility performance of the strengthened structures. The calculated maximal dosage of shear strengthened RC beams is about 0.99 and 1.01 of the practical maximal dosage. The calculation methods can be used in critical dosage analysis for avoiding the reinforcement material waste and the appearance of unreasonable failure modes.

84901674137	Experimental investigation on aseismic behavior of dual steel high strength concrete shear walls with high axial load ratio	In order to research the aseismic behavior of dual steel high strength concrete (DSHSC) shear walls, a quasi-static test for four specimens was carried out. The shear-span ratio of all specimens was 2.5. The failure mechanism, hysteretic behavior, deformability and energy dissipation capacity under a cyclic lateral load were analyzed by changing the space of binding bars and stiffeners. The results showed that two failure models of the wall were the buckling of the steel tube and the crash of core concrete at the base of the specimens. All of the DSHSC structural walls had plump hysteretic curves and no significant pinch phenomenon. The displacement ductility coefficient varied from 3.11 to 4.37. The equivalent viscous damping ratio ranged from 0.158 to 0.291. Both ductility coefficient and equivalent viscous damping ratio can satisfy requirements of aseismic design. Under same axial compression ratio, the specimens with stiffeners show a better aseismic performance than the ones with binding bars. The deformability of the specimen was significantly improved when the space of stiffeners and binding bars decreased, and the specimens showed a good energy dissipation capacity.
