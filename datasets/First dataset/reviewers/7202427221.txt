84941354214	A dual-channel location estimation system for providing location services based on the GPS and GSM networks	A dual channel system, which is based on the GPS and the GSM network, is being developed to compensate the problem of the loss of GPS signals in providing location services to mobile users in urban areas. In this design, when GPS signals are being blocked in blind spot areas, GSM positioning algorithms would be used as an alterative method to provide location estimations. This research is an investigation in search of a set of location estimation algorithms based on signal attenuation to work with GPS, so as to develop a dual channel positioning system. With the technical support from a local mobile operator we have constructed and conducted several real world experiments for our investigation and results are promising.

84949293693	A priority feedback mechanism for distributed MPEG video player systems	In this paper, a priority feedback mechanism is proposed for adjusting the priorities of the processes dynamically in a video server according to the current status of thae clients - the status can be reflected by the number of frames being dropped in a period of time. The priority feedback mechanism is implemented in a distributed MPEG video player system. Different priority mapping functions are suggested for the priority feedback mechanism to cater for different service requirements of the clients, especially when the clients are demanding different quality of services. Experiment results have shown that when the video server is serving several clients where every client may demand a play speed of their own, the use of the priority feedback mechanism can effectively improve the whole system performance.

18944373391	Embedded program testing in untestable mobile environment: An experience of trustworthiness approach	Comparing actual output with the expected output of some controlled input is a fundamental principle of program correctness testing. However, in some situations, the input is uncontrollable or even undetectable during testing and, hence, it is impossible to decide the expected output or the test oracle. We encountered this problem when we developed programs to extract network data from various mobile stations in the Mobile Location Estimation System project. We propose testing the trustworthiness of the programs instead. Since the input is uncontrollable and undetectable, program output is analyzed and challenged against with the intrinsic properties, environment, the program output itself and their application results, to find evidence that the output is suitable to be used for the planned purposes. Furthermore, in the case of mobile software development, it is common that different programs of the same specification have to be developed for mobile stations of different models. These different implementations provide another source of reference for trustworthiness tests. Our experience of applying trustworthiness test in extracting network data from mobile stations is reported in this paper. © 2004 IEEE.

0011179355	A new method for integrated end-to-end delay analysis in ATM networks	For admitting a hard real-time connection to an ATM network, it is required that the end-to-end delays of cells belonging to the connection meet their deadlines without violating the guarantees already provided to the currently active connections. There are two kinds of methods to analyze the end-to-end delay in an ATM network. A decomposed method analyzes the worst case delay for each switch and then computes the total delay as the sum of the delays at individual switches. On the other hand, an integrated method analyzes all the switches involved in an integrated manner and derives the total delay directly. In this paper, we present an efficient and effective integrated method to compute the end-to-end delay. We evaluate the network performance under different system parameters and we compare the performance of the proposed method with the conventional decomposed and other integrated methods [1], [3], [5]-[9].

0030394234	Performance studies of transmitting real-time MPEG-I video in ATM networks	This paper presents a performance study of ATM Network in the support of real-time MPEG-I video transmission. Multiple classes of MPEG-I will be used in the study and what makes this simulation study different from the others is the video data we used. These data are captured from real video programmes and we categorized these video clips according to their workload characteristics. The performance of the ATM switch is examined in terms of the cell miss ratio due to deadline missing and the cell loss ratio due to buffer overflow in both the ATM switch as well as the gateways. Moreover, a higher level of abstraction in terms of burst loss ratio will also be collected. The results indicated that the first-come-first-serve scheduling algorithm is insufficient to handle real-time traffic. This paper presents a better method to improve the performance significantly especially when the virtual path bandwidth negotiated is conservative.

These data are captured from real video programmes and we categorized these video clips according to their workload characteristics. The performance of the FDDI network is examined in terms of the maximum number of MPEG-I video streams got transmitted over the network without missing their deadlines. This simulation study observed that by employing the Intentional-delay scheme, we can improve the performance by an average of 35%. From another set of simulation experiment, when applying the Frame-grouping scheme for MPEG-I transmission, we can improve the performance up to 150%.

0031356686	Video smoothing algorithm for transmitting MPEG video over limited bandwidth	MPEG video transmission will make up a significant portion of the workload on future computer networks. These Variable Bit Rate (VBR) compressed video is known to exhibit significant, multiple-time-scale bit rate variability. To such bursty traffic, it is always a compromise between providing a good Quality of Service (QoS) and a high utilization on the network bandwidth. One can adopt an optimal video smoothing algorithm to smooth out the data transmission from a server to a client so that the network utilization can be improved. In this paper, we present a smoothing algorithm for transmitting stored MPEG-I video stream under a user-defined maximum network bandwidth. We also consider the impact of the startup latency, and the client's buffer size on the network utilization. Our algorithm differs from the others in that we do video smoothing under a pre-defined bandwidth. At the cost of either deleting B-frames for a short period of time or by introducing a one-time playback pause, the network utilization can be improved dramatically without scarifying much on the video quality.

0031367151	Integrated delay analysis of regulated ATM switch	In this paper, we present an efficient and effective method to derive the worst case delay in an ATM switch. In an ATM switch, admitting a hard real-time connection requires the delays of cells belonging to the connection meeting their deadline without violating the guarantees already provided to connections that are currently active. Previous studies have shown that the real-time connection traffic and the available service can both be described by piece-wise linear functions in terms of time. By utilizing the inverse of the arrival and service functions, we obtain an efficient and effective method to compute the worst case delay of a connection to an ATM switch. We analyze and compare the performance of an ATM switch with priority driven and FIFO scheduling policies under different utilization. We also compare the performance using our proposed 'integrated' method with the traditional 'independent' method. From simulation experiments, we found out that our method always obtain a higher admission probability and a better estimation of cell delay within an ATM switch.

In this paper, a priority feedback mechanism for a video server is proposed. With our pre-defined priority mapping functions and the feedback signal from each client, the video server will make adjustment in terms of priority to the server processes in order to support each client which possess a quality of service (QoS) requirement of its own. From our experiments, we find that when a video server is serving multiple clients, the use of a priority feedback mechanism can improve the overall video system performance. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

2342523233	Maintaining temporal consistency in broadcast environments	In this paper, we study the performance and impact of maintaining temporal consistency on a recently proposed concurrency control protocol for processing transactions in broadcast environments. This protocol offers autonomy between mobile clients and the server such that mobile clients can read consistent data off the air without contacting the server. However, most of the existing mobile computing applications, such as information dispersal systems for stock prices and weather information, are comprised of real-time read only transactions. In order to deliver timely and useful results, real-time transactions must also read temporal consistent data. A number of approaches to maintaining temporal consistency are studied through a series of simulation experiments. Results show that taking advantage of data semantics and temporal consistency requirement can improve the performance of mobile read only transactions in broadcast environments.

3042580392	Locating mobile stations with statistical directional propagation model	Recently, mobile location estimation is drawing considerable attention in the field of wireless communications. Among different mobile location estimation methods, the one which estimates the location of mobile stations with reference to the wave propagation model is drawing much attention. This approach, in principle, makes use of the most primitive property of wave propagation - signal strength, to perform location estimation. Hence this approach should be able to apply to different kinds of cellular network. We found out that in estimating mobile location with reference to signal strength, the azimuth gain of directional antenna and environmental factors can help to improve the accuracy. In this paper, we report our study of a Directional Propagation Model (DPM) which enhanced the traditional propagation model with these factors. We experimented our model with 3,703 sets of real life data collected from a major mobile phone operator of Hong Kong. Results show that the DPM models have significant improvement over other existing location methods in terms of accuracy and stability.

Among different kind of location estimation technologies, the one which estimates the location of mobile stations using signal strength is able to be applied to different kinds of cellular network, and therefore, is more general. We have designed a directional propagation model - the Ellipse Propagation Model (EPM) which makes use of a wave propagation model to perform location estimation. The EPM enhanced the traditional propagation model by resembling the contour line of signal strength as an ellipse rather than a circle and hence becoming more realistic. We have tested the EPM with real data taken in Hong Kong and it is proven that the EPM out performing other existing location estimation algorithms in different kinds of terrains. © 2005 IEEE.

However, in some situations, the input is uncontrollable or even undetectable during testing, it is impossible to decide the expected output or the test oracle. Or in some situations, the output may be indeterministic or unpredictable, hence it is impossible to compare the output with the expected one.

In short, we accessed the trustworthiness of the programs.

We propose and perform a series of simulation experiments, using real traffic data from the access log of the official web site for FIFA 2002 World Cup. Simulation results show that our proposed broadcast algorithm not only succeeds in providing good on-time delivery of data but at the same time provides 2 to 3 times of improvement in response time over traditional scheduling algorithms like First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and Earliest-DeadlineFirst (EDF).

33748869857	A QoS-enabled transmission scheme for MPEG video streaming	While MPEG is the de facto encoding standard for video services, online video streaming service is becoming popular over the open network such as the Internet. As the performance of open network is non-predictable and uncontrollable, the tuning of the quality of service (QoS) for on-line video streaming services is difficult. In order to provide better QoS for the delivery of videos, there are proposals of new encoding formats or new transmission protocols for on-line video streaming. However, these results are not compatible with popular video players or network protocols and hence these approaches are so far not very successful. We use another approach which tries to by-pass these problems. We designed a QoS Tuning Scheme and a QoS-Enabled Transmission Scheme for transmitting MPEG videos from video servers to clients. According to the traffic characteristics between the video server and each individual client, the QoS Tuning Scheme tunes the QoS to be delivered to each individual client on the fly. Furthermore, our QoS-Enabled Transmission Scheme can be applied over any protocol, such as HTTP which is the most popular protocol over the open network. With our transmission scheme, bandwidth can be better utilized by reducing transmitted frames which would have missed their deadlines and would eventually be discarded by the clients. This is achieved by sending frames according to their impact on the QoS in the playback under the allowed throughput. With these schemes, users can enjoy video streaming through their favorite video players and with the best possible QoS. In order to facilitate the real time QoS tuning, a metric, QoS-GFS, is developed. This QoS-GFS is extended from the QoS-Index, another metric which has taken human perspective in the measurement of video quality. Hence QoS-GFS is better than the common metrics which measures QoS by means of rate of transmission of bytes or MPEG frames. We designed and implemented a middleware to perform empirical tests of the proposed transmission scheme and QoS tuning scheme. Experiment results show that our schemes can effectively enhance the QoS for online MPEG video streaming services. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

33749051422	An improved ellipse propagation model for location estimation in facilitating ubiquitous computing	Positioning is a crucial technology for ubiquitous computing. A directional propagation model - the Ellipse Propagation Model (EPM) is proposed by our research group for locating a mobile station (MS) within a radio cellular network with an accuracy that can enable a number of location based services to realize ubiquitous computing. By using a Geometric Algorithm, the location of the mobile station can be estimated. However, since one parameter in our Geometric Algorithm is fixed, errors may be induced as the surrounding environment changes. In view of this, we would like to propose a new algorithm - the Iterative Algorithm to provide the positioning based on EPM. With the technical support of two local mobile phone operators, we have conducted a series of experiments using real data and experiment results showed that the proposed Iterative Algorithm outperforms the Geometric Algorithm by a good margin of 18% in terms of average error. © 2005 IEEE.

33750947668	A selector method for providing mobile location estimation services within a radio cellular network	Mobile location estimation or mobile positioning is becoming an important service for a mobile phone network. It is well-known that GPS can provide accurate location estimation, but it is also a known fact that GPS does not perform well in urban areas like downtown New York and cities like Hong Kong. Then many mobile location estimation approaches based on radio cellular networks have been proposed to compensate the problem of the lost of GPS signals in providing location services to mobile users in metropolitan areas. In this paper, we present a selector method with the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) among different kinds of mobile location estimation technologies we had proposed in previous work in order to combine their merits, then provide a more accurate estimation for location services. We build up a three-level binary tree to classify these four algorithms. These three levels are named as Stat-Geo level, CG-nonCG level and CT-EPM level. And these success ratios of these three levels are 85.22%, 88.45% and 88.89% respectively. We have tested our selector method with real data taken in Hong Kong and it is proven that it outperforms other existing location estimation algorithms among different kinds of terrains. © 2006 IEEE.

Among different mobile location estimation methods, the one which estimates the location of mobile stations with reference to the wave propagation model is drawing much attention on the grounds that it is applicable to different kinds of cellular network. However the estimation accuracy of the signal propagation model deteriorates as the distance between the mobile station and the receiving base station increases. In view of this, we have designed a New Location Estimation Approach which has divided the location estimation into two phases, the Data Collection Phase and the Location Estimation Phase. In this paper, we report our study of the New Location Estimation Approach. We tested the approach with real life data collected from a major mobile operator of Hong Kong. Results show that the New Location Estimation Approach has improved the existing statistical signal propagation model by 30.94%.

34547607397	An enhanced wireless LAN positioning algorithm based on the fingerprint approach	As ubiquitous computing gained much attention in recent years, location estimation in wireless LAN becomes a hot topic. Previous research work suggests the use of the averaged Received Signal Strength (RSS) as fingerprint can achieve high accuracy for location estimation. In a library environment, however, the accuracy of such traditional approach is barely acceptable. It is because library contains considerably large number of metal bookshelves, and limited number of access points. Worse yet, the layout of these access points in the library is fixed for connection to the Internet, and therefore it is hard to change the environment to adapt for location estimation system. In this paper, we introduce an enhanced fingerprint (EFP) algorithm, and tested it in a library environment. The experiment result showed that the proposed EFP algorithm can have more than 30% of improvement in accuracy over traditional approaches without changing anything in the library environment. © 2006 IEEE.

We conducted series of field tests with the networks of two major mobile phone operators of Hong Kong. Among 6120 real world readings obtained from these field tests, the average errors of CEM is 49.03 meter with a variance of 538.14. When comparing the results of CEM with the Center of Gravity Method (CGM), another mobile location estimation also based on signal strength ratio, CEM has an improvement of 33.85% with about the same variance.

35048894424	The design of a QoS-aware MPEG-4 video system	With the advance in computer and network technologies, the real-time interaction and the on-time delivery of multimedia data through the Internet by broadband network are becoming more popular. A variety of multimedia systems and Internet applications have been emerging, fulfilling the ever increasing demand on the Internet streaming applications. This paper outlines the design of a MPEG-4 video system. With the new features provided by the MPEG-4 standard, i.e. the object-based media with arbitrary- shaped coding, object-based QoS degradation is possible. It enables the system to discard the less important objects within the video stream when the network is congested. Our video system proposes a new transmission scheme for the system to transmit MPEG-4 video over an open network. Based on the nature of the video objects and their frames, transmission priorities among video objects are assigned. The transmission scheme then regulates the flow of the video data and their frames so that important data are delivered on time to the video client regardless the delay fluctuation of the open network. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

0032669053	On traffic burstiness and priority assignment for the real-time connections in a regulated ATM network	From our previous studies, we derived the worst case cell delay within an ATM switch and thus can find the worst case end-to-end delay for a set of real-time connections. We observed that these delays are sensitive to the priority assignment of the connections. With a better priority assignment scheme within the switch, the worst case delay can be reduced and provide a better network performance. We extend our previous work on the closed form analysis to conduct more experimental study of how different priority assignments and system parameters may affect the performance. Furthermore, from our worst case delay analysis on a regulated ATM switch, network traffic can be smoothed by a leaky bucket at the output controller for each connection. With the appropriate setting on the leaky bucket parameter, the burstiness of the network traffic can be reduced without increasing the delay in the switch. Therefore, fewer buffers will be required for each active connection within the switch. In this paper, our experimental results have shown that the buffer requirement can be reduced up to 5.75% for each connection, which could be significant, when hundreds of connections are passing through the switches within a regulated ATM network.

0032682239	Transmitting real-time VBR traffic with QoS control in a timed token medium access control network	By exploring the characteristics of the Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) coded frame sequence and the expected quality of service (QoS) of video applications, we have designed different transmission strategies for transmitting real-time VBR videos over a computer network. In this article, we present three MPEG video transmission schemes with the objective of increasing the maximum number of video streams that can be supported by the underlying network without sacrificing much on the video quality. Multiple classes of the MPEG video are examined in this study. These data are captured from real video programmes and we categorized these video clips according to their traffic burstiness and workload characteristics. The results reveal that, by employing the intentional delay scheme, we could improve the performance by 67-166%. In the case of applications, allowing different levels of QoS, the QoS Control Scheme alone can improve the performance by 77 and 112% when the QoS level is set to 90 and 60%, respectively. When we combined these two schemes together and formed our third scheme, namely the QoS Control with intentional delay, the performance improvement can be pushed to 271%, which is a dramatic improvement over the default uncontrolled transmission scheme.

0033316171	Efficient delay computation methods for an ATM network with real-time video traffic	Consider a real-time communication application running on top of an ATM network, we require the connection to provide a transmission guarantee for the real-time service. Such transmission guarantee can only be possible if there exists an absolute and deterministic worst case delay bound on all the ATM cells within the real-time connection. In this paper, we present our approach in finding this worst case cell delay within an ATM switch. In terms of computation complexity, we find out that our proposed method is no harder than any other existing methods in finding such worse case delay. Furthermore, while other researchers tackle different schedulers with different approaches, our method is general enough and is applicable to schedulers that adopt the FIFO, Static Priority (SP), Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) scheduling policies. In addition, in our proposed 'Fixed Points' method, we trade-off accuracy with computation complexity for performance, as a result, our improved method is shown to be superior to all existing methods in terms of computation complexity. Through our simulation experiments based on real-time MPEG video streams, the loss in accuracy for estimating the worst case cell delay is shown to be negligible for the connection admission control for an ATM network.

The statistical delay analysis provides the methods to determine the statistical delay bound for the network traffic which is more suitable for the connection admission control for an ATM network with different output port controllers.

This family of algorithms consider request deadline, data object size and data popularity in making scheduling decisions. Although previous scheduling algorithms also base on some or all of these attributes to choose the most beneficial data to be broadcast, they did not consider the loss brought by their scheduling decisions. However, MRS considers both gain and loss in making a scheduling decision. We have performed a series of simulation experiments to compare the performance of various algorithms. Simulation results show that our proposed broadcast algorithm not only succeeds in providing good on-time delivery of data but at the same time provides 20% of improvement in response time over traditional scheduling algorithms like First-InFirst-Out (FIFO) and Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF).

58049083376	Improvements to RADAR location classification	Location estimation has been a backbone for location-aware services as wireless networks and mobile devices are more pervasively available. By operating on the signal strength space, nearest neighbor methods like RADAR have proved to be simple yet effective for location estimation. It has been common to take locations as classes, and then to infer location classes based on signal strength measurements. Under such a location classification setting, this paper investigates in detail the k-nearest neighbor approach in RADAR, and demonstrates that considering more neighboring signal strength measurements usually cannot help. Instead the orientations in which the signal strength is taken should be more carefully treated. This paper also develops a refinement step for RADAR, by building nearest neighbor classifiers to further clarify several top location estimates by RADAR. At a very economic cost, our refinement step can significantly boost the accuracy. © 2008 IEEE.

0034274225	Performance evaluation of transmission schemes for real-time traffic in a high-speed timed-token MAC network	The fast development of high-speed networks makes many real-time multimedia applications possible. These applications usually involve the transmission of massive amounts of digital video data, which requires the application of video image compression technology, under a stringent timing constraint. As a result, the transmission of the variable bit rate (VBR) traffic generated by the compression algorithms plays a very important role in meeting the real-time requirement of the applications. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of the real-time traffic generated by Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG), which is one of the most notable video image compression standards, and evaluate four different transmission schemes for the real-time VBR traffic. In order to have a deterministic behavior and bounded message delays, we choose the timed token medium access control (MAC) protocol for the evaluation of our transmission schemes. Judging from our maximum bandwidth demand analysis, and after a series of intensive simulation experiments, the results reveal that in our best scenario, the performance improvement (PI) can be as high as 422% over the original default transmission scheme in terms of the number of video streams that can be supported in the network.

On this basis, we formulate the static and dynamic snapshot consistency requirements on serving real-time requests for temporal data items. Two online algorithms are proposed to enhance the system performance with different requirements. In particular, a reschedule mechanism is developed to make the scheduling adaptable to the dynamic snapshot consistency requirement. A comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithms.

43949138425	Providing location estimation within a metropolitan area based on a mobile phone network	Although location estimation algorithms based on signal attenuation may not be the most promising approach for providing location services, signal strength is the only common attribute available among various kind of mobile network. Together with the fact that the cell layout in metropolitan areas like Hong Kong is different from other smaller cities, this paper is an investigation and a revisit in search of a set of location estimation algorithms based on signal attenuation. With the technical support from a local mobile operator, we have constructed and conducted several real world experiments for our investigation and results are promising.

46449108002	Wireless LAN positioning based on received signal strength from mobile device and access points	Most of the WLAN positioning systems use Received Signal Strength (RSS) as an important information to estimate the location of a mobile station. In fact, RSS can be obtained at the access points or at the mobile device, and most of the previous works use either way to collect this information. In this paper, we propose a new WLAN positioning approach by making use of the RSS collected at both the access points and mobile device. Besides, our new approach is positioning algorithm independent, which means the user can apply any location estimation algorithm with our new data acquisition approach. With our new data acquisition approach, our experiments had shown that the accuracy of location estimation can be improved by 12.84% to 38.23% on the average, as compare to the previous work which only uses the RSS information from either access points or the mobile device. © 2007 IEEE.

48849106455	A train-once approach for location estimation using the directional propagation model	Location estimation that is based on the mobile phone network has drawn considerable attention in the field of wireless communications. Among the different mobile location estimation methods, the one that estimates a mobile station location with reference to a wave propagation model is shown to be effective and is applicable to different kinds of cellular networks, including Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), cdmaOne, CDMA2000, and the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System. We have designed a train-once approach for location estimations using the directional propagation model (DPM). The DPM is an improved model that is based on the traditional free-space wave propagation model with the directional gain and environmental factors integrated in the estimation. The train-once approach works because we observe that different types of antennas are designed for different types of environments. Thus, a parameter estimation is related to the antenna type and, in turn, related to the environment. In this paper, we report our study of the train-once approach with the DPM for location estimations. We have tested our model with 192177 sets of real-life data that have been collected from a major mobile phone operator in Hong Kong. Experimental results show that the train-once approach with the DPM is practical and outperforms the existing location estimation algorithms in terms of accuracy, stability among different types of terrains, and success rates. © 2008 IEEE.

50249187842	Enhancing indoor positioning accuracy by utilizing signals from both the mobile phone network and the wireless local area network	Indoor positioning technology and its accuracy are crucial research topics for ubiquitous computing. While the GSM-based approach has always been used to provide outdoor positioning to compensate the lost of GPS in urban area, we seldom see systems that utilize the GSM-based approach for indoor positioning. On the other hand, the WLAN-based approach is widely used to provide indoor positioning service. However, with its Ad hoc layout and signal fluctuation, it is hard to provide a good performance based on the WLAN-based approach. In this paper, we develop an indoor positioning system that makes use of both GSM and WLAN signals to do location estimation such that the resultant system is more accurate and more stable and thus enhancing the performance of the whole system. Experimental results show that our system is stable and can reach centimeter-level accuracy, which outperforms other existing indoor positioning systems that utilizes a single network only. © 2008 IEEE.

49449093948	A directional propagation model for locating mobile stations within a mobile phone network	Mobile location estimation is becoming a high value added service on cellular phone networks. Among different mobile location estimation methods, the one which estimates the location of Mobile Stations (MSs) with reference to an intrinsics of wireless communication, signal strengths, is able to be applied to different kinds of cellular network, and hence is more general. This approach makes use of a wave propagation model to perform location estimation. Most wave propagation models are non-directional. However, we found out that in estimating mobile location with reference to signal strength, the azimuth gain of directional antenna and environmental factors can help to improve the accuracy. In this paper, we report our study of a Directional Propagation Model (DPM) which enhanced the traditional propagation model with these factors. We experimented our model with 192,177 sets of real life data covering most parts of Hong Kong collected from a major mobile hone operator of Hong Kong. Results show that the DPM models have significant improvement over other existing location methods in terms of accuracy and stability. Copyright © 2008, Inderscience Publishers.

53549114225	Scheduling real-time multi-item requests in on-demand broadcast	On-demand broadcast is an effective wireless data dissemination technique to enhance system scalability and capability to handle dynamic user access patterns. Previous studies on time-critical on-demand data broadcast were under the assumption that each client requests only one data item at a time. With rapid growth of time-critical information dissemination services in emerging applications, there is an increasing need for systems to support efficient processing of real-time multi-item requests. Little work, however, has considered on-demand broadcast environment with time-critical multi-item requests. In this paper, we investigate the scheduling problem arising in this new environment and observe that existing single item request based algorithms are unable to manage multi-item requests efficiently. Thus, an innovative algorithm that combines the strengths of data item scheduling and request scheduling is proposed. The performance results of our simulation show that the proposed algorithm is superior to other classical algorithms under a variety of circumstances. Our algorithm not only reduces deadline miss ratio of requests, but also saves broadcast channel bandwidth. © 2008 IEEE.

0034482486	Performance analysis of transmission schemes for VBR traffic on a real-time network	The growth of real-time networks and parallel and distributed algorithms has accelerated the progress in distributed multimedia applications. These applications usually involve the transmission of digital videos over a real-time network. Because of the size of the video, most video data needs to be compressed before being transmitted. Among all the compression schemes, the MPEG standard is most notable. Hence, there is a need to investigate the transmission schemes tailored for handling variable bit rate (VBR) traffic over a real-time network. Needing to choose a typical real-time network for our transmission experiments, we chose the timed token medium access control protocol for our evaluation because of its acceptance in the real-time communication community. In this paper, we propose four different transmission schemes for real-time VBR traffic. With analysis and intensive simulation, the results reveal that in our best scenario, the performance improvement can be as high as 422% over the original default transmission scheme.

It is well-known that GPS can provide an accurate location estimation. But it is also a known fact that GPS does not perform well in urban areas like downtown New York and cities like Hong Kong. Many mobile location estimation approaches based on cellular networks have been proposed to compensate the problem of the lost of GPS signals in providing location services to mobile users in metropolitan areas. Among different kinds of mobile location estimation technologies, only the class of signal strength based algorithm which estimates the location of the Mobile Station (MS) by signal strength received from the nearly Base Stations (BSs) can be applied to different kinds of cellular networks, and therefore, it is a more general solution. In this paper, we design a directional propagation model, the Modified Directional Propagation Model (MDPM), which makes use of a common signal propagation model to perform location estimation. We test MDPM with real data taken in Hong Kong and experimental results show that MDPM outperforms other existing location estimation algorithms among different kinds of terrains and environmental factors. © 2009 IEEE.

We have designed a directional propagation model-the Ellipse Propagation Model (EPM), which makes use of a common signal propagation model to perform a location estimation. EPM enhanced the traditional propagation model by resembling the contour line of the signal strength as an ellipse rather than a circle and hence becoming more realistic. We have tested EPM with real data taken in Hong Kong and it is proven that EPM outperforms other existing location estimation algorithms among different kinds of terrains. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

77955179024	Privacy-aware location data publishing	This article examines a new problem of k-anonymity with respect to a reference dataset in privacyaware location data publishing: given a user dataset and a sensitive event dataset, we want to generalize the user dataset such that by joining it with the event dataset through location, each event is covered by at least k users. Existing k-anonymity algorithms generalize every k user locations to the same vague value, regardless of the events. Therefore, they tend to overprotect against the privacy compromise and make the published data less useful. In this article, we propose a new generalization paradigm called local enlargement, as opposed to conventional hierarchy- or partition-based generalization. Local enlargement guarantees that user locations are enlarged just enough to cover all events k times, and thus maximize the usefulness of the published data. We develop an O(H

78449311889	Detecting, locating, and tracking hacker activities within a WLAN network	With a good location estimation integrated into a Wi-Fi surveillance system, system administrator can closely monitor the network traffic as well as the behavior of the mobile users. Hence, there is a growing demand to have a quick and efficient way to indentify a specific group of people, or devices or asset within a controlled wireless network. In our proposed system, all the Wi-Fi traffic and information especially the MAC addresses and RSSI from the mobile clients (i.e. Wi-Fi devices) can be sniffed by an open-source Wi-Fi access point (AP) with custom-made embedded software program and without preloading any client program on the mobile user devices. These sniffed information is then analyzed and stored in a database which will help network administrator to monitor the wireless network for surveillance purpose and security concerns. In summary, this paper proposes a wireless LAN system that can detect, locate and track down wireless communication within the system by modifying the embedded software in off-the-shelf WLAN APs. Experiment results have shown that abnormal wireless activities can be detected and by our signal strength based localization algorithm, positions of these wireless mobile devices can be identified and be tracked within meters inside our WLAN system. © 2010 IEEE.

79957503771	A component-level self-configuring personal agent platform for pervasive computing	Mobile agents have been widely used in distributed computing to take care of the task execution for the user. It is also suitable for mobile and pervasive computing. However, a pervasive computing environment is characterised by high diversity and dynamism, which gives rise to the requirement that a mobile agent executed in such environments has the self-configuring capability. In this paper, we study the problem, when an object providing a service enters the environment, how a mobile agent without prior knowledge about the object can interact with the service. We describe a method for the mobile agent to obtain the corresponding interaction codes and instantiate them for the interaction at runtime with minimal human involvement. We call this component-level self-configuration. Currently, no existing system renders a mobile agent with such capability. We propose a framework, which consists of a unified model for all the participating objects and mechanisms for a mobile agent to dynamically obtain interaction code and self-configuring it for execution. A prototype platform has been implemented and a preliminary performance study has also been carried out. Our experimental results show that the overhead caused by the component-level self-configuration is acceptable. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

79957762503	A signal strength based location estimation algorithm within a wireless network	With the prevalence of Wi-Fi activity within a wireless network, there are growing interests in mobile surveillance and device tracking for better network services. With a good location estimation algorithm integrated into a wireless network, system administrators can closely monitor the network traffic as well as the behavior of the mobile users. By modifying the embedded software in off-the-shelf WLAN APs, our system can sniff out data packets transmitted by WLAN devices without the need to install client programs on mobile user devices. In this paper we propose the Aggregated Signal Layout location estimation algorithm. Experiment results show that once wireless activities had been detected, our signal strength based localization algorithm can estimate positions of the wireless mobile devices involved with great success rate and good accuracy. With an accuracy comparable to the fingerprinting method but without paying the high costs of training and maintenance of the fingerprint databases inside our WLAN system, the proposed Aggregated Signal Layout method is well-justified for its efficiency and effectiveness in locating and tracking mobile users' activities within a wireless network. © 2011 IEEE.

In this letter, we first discuss some definitions and superposition properties of self-similar processes. We obtain some good results about the property of merging self-similar data streams. Then we present a model of a single server with infinite buffer and prove that when the queue length has finite second-order moment, the input process, being strong asymptotically second-order self-similar (sas-s), is equivalent to the output process which also bears the sas-s property. © 2004 IEEE.

Experiment results show that once wireless activities had been detected, our signal strength based localization algorithm can estimate positions of the wireless mobile devices involved with great success rate and good accuracy. Based upon our previous research result, better design and implementation to our Wireless Location Estimation become our next challenging objective. A well designed system will minimize the traffic within the network, as well as the chance of being overload the estimation system. Since more than a hundred packets are transferred in the air within a second, huge amount of packet details such as MAC address of the mobile station and the corresponding RSSI is difficult to be transferred to the data server at once. Besides, the problem is amplified when more than one WLAN APs want to transmit all the packet information to the data server at the same time. Hence, a more technically advance software design in off-the-shelf WLAN APs is needed. Thus, the design and implementation of an intelligence wireless data summarization, data storage middle-ware machine, optimized data server and location estimation server, are our major concern in terms of stability, flexibility and performance. © 2012 IEEE.

84860781194	A wireless LAN location estimation system using center of gravity as an algorithm selector for enhancing location estimation	With the prevalence of mobile Wi-Fi devices and infrastructures, there are growing interests in mobile surveillance and device tracking for providing better location-aware services in metropolitan areas. With a good location estimation integrated into a wireless infrastructure, system administrators can closely monitor the network traffic as well as the behavior of the mobile users. The Received Signal Strength(RSS), easily available information from Access Point(AP) Sensors, has become the most popular research approach. However, in reality received signal strength is affected by factors such as occlusion, signal deflections and reflections. There had been proposed estimation systems that use the Fingerprinting approach to provide good and accurate location recommendation. But such systems have been drawn back by their time-intensive training and retraining process. The solution to Signal Strength-based estimation, therefore, is to devise a system that minimizes the training Andre adaptation process while attaining good accuracy in location estimation. This paper proposes a location estimation system whose estimation method is based on the Center of Gravity(CG)method. This method also serves as an algorithm selector such that the system can switch to another estimation algorithm if need be. The aim of this system is to reduce the high cost of training and re-calibration but attain an accuracy comparable to the Fingerprinting location estimation approach. © 2012 IEEE.

0036844041	A computation method for providing statistical performance guarantee to an ATM switch	ATM is a connection-oriented technology and messages are divided into fixed size packet called cells to facilitate communications. However, before two hosts can communicate, a connection has to be established between them. Consider a real-time communication application running on top of an ATM network. In order to provide the real-time service, we require the network to provide a performance guarantee for the connection. There are two types of performance guarantees: deterministic and statistical guarantees. While a deterministic guarantee provides an absolute bound on the worst case cell delay experienced in an ATM switch, a statistical guarantee provides a probabilistic bound on the worst case cell delay. In this paper, we use a self-similar stochastic process to characterize the arrival of the real-time traffic. Extending from our previous work on deterministic delay guarantee, we provide methods for determinating the statistical delay bound for the worst case cell delay in an ATM switch with various output port controllers. We conclude this paper with two case studies: one based on ordinary LAN traffic and one on the variable bit-rate MPEG video transmission of the movie "Star Wars". To show the effectiveness of our statistical delay guarantee, we compare it with the delay derived by Cruz as well as the actual cell delay determined by the two traffic traces.

Multiple classes of MPEG video are used in the study. These data are captured from real video programmes and we categorized these video clips according to their traffic burstiness and workload characteristics. The performance measure of the timed token MAC network is in terms of the maximum number of MPEG video streams being transmitted without any frame missing its deadline. This simulation study observed that by employing the Regulated Scheme, we could improve the performance by 28 to 40%. When applying the Grouping Scheme for the MPEG transmission, we can improve the performance between 142 and 149%. When we combined the two schemes together, the Regulated Grouping Scheme can further improve the performance up to 153% which is a dramatic improvement over the original transmission scheme.

0038521605	Generating test cases from class vectors	Specifications are the primary source for obtaining test cases in software testing. Specification based testing is becoming more and more important when black box components and COTS are widely used in software development. An important issue in system testing is to identify all the legitimate input. One of these systematic approaches is deriving test cases from classification tree. This approach partitions the input domain into classifications which are further partitioned into classes. Test cases are combinations of classes. Relations between classification and classes are identified and are used to construct the classification tree. From the classification tree, combination table is constructed. Test cases are derived from the combination table. However, human decisions are required in determining whether test cases derived from the combination table are legitimate. This problem is incurred by the limitation of the expressive power of classification trees which cannot express the relations among classes precisely. We propose an enhancement by expressing the relations among classes and the relations among classifications directly in vectors. We call this new approach Class Vectors. This paper presents the class vector approach with formal definitions of basic concepts and entities. We find that the expressive power of class vectors is higher than classification trees, that is, this approach can express the information given in the specification in a better way and derive all legitimate test cases with minimal human decisions. Furthermore, a method of generating legitimate test cases using class vectors is described. This method is derived from the formal semantics of class vector, hence it is theoretical sound. Finally, we discussed that the proposed method requires the least amount of human decisions, can be highly automatic and has good usability. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Then many mobile location estimation approaches based on the cellular radio networks have been proposed to compensate the problem of the lost of GPS signals for providing location services to mobile users in metropolitan areas, but there exists no general solution since each algorithm has its own advantage depending on specific terrain and environmental factors. In this paper, we propose a selector method with LDA among different kinds of mobile location estimation algorithms we had proposed in previous work to combine their merits, then provide a more accurate estimation for location services. And we build up a three level binary decision tree to classify these four algorithms. These three levels are named as Stat-Geo level, CG-non CG level and CT-EPM level. And the success ratios of these three levels are 85.22%, 88.45% and 88.89% respectively.

84878516147	An effective signal strength-based wireless location estimation system for tracking indoor mobile users	Localization is an essential function for location-dependent services. Although various efficient localization methods have been proposed, many of them have not tested with practical applications. Different location-dependent applications may have very different performance and operation requirements such as the accuracy in localization and frequency of location tracking. In this paper, based on our previous works on the design of efficient localization methods, we study the important issues in the design and implementation of a location tracking system for monitoring people in an indoor environment within a large building such as in rehabit centres and schools. In estimating the current location of a mobile user, we adopt the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) approach. Enhancements are proposed to improve the accuracy in localization using RSSI. To ensure the reliability of the location results and the efficiency in location tracking, it is important to minimize the traffic of location data on the network, as well as the chance of overloading the estimation system. Various issues in the design of the system are discussed and the performance results of the system are provided to illustrate the efficiency and the limitations of the proposed methods. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we propose a novel business model for sales promotion in retail chain stores with the use of WLAN localization and near field communication (NFC) technologies. The objectives of the business model are to increase the flow volume of customers into the retail chain stores and their incentives in purchasing selected items in the stores. In the proposed business model, the NFC technology is used as the first mean to motivate customers to come to the stores. Then, with the use of WLAN, the movement behavior of the customers, who are carrying smart phones, within the stores is captured and maintained in a movement database. By exploring the movement behavior of a customer, personalized promotion and marketing strategies can then be applied to increase the incentive of the customer for purchasing his interested items when he enters the stores again. In addition, we also propose an enhanced R-tree for indexing the data items maintained in the movement database and to support various types of spatial management and marketing queries to maximize the utilization of space in a store for displaying the sales items. © 2013 IEEE.

84884606949	A conditional abortable priority ceiling protocol for real-time systems with mixed tasks	Priority Ceiling Protocol (PCP) is a well known synchronization protocol for hard real time systems. However, it has a problem of ceiling blocking which imposes a great hindrance to real time systems especially for those with mixed tasks. A novel protocol called the Conditional Abortable Priority Ceiling Protocol (CA-PCP) is proposed. It resolves the problem by incorporating a conditional abort scheme into PCP. The new protocol inherits all the desirable characteristics from PCP and Ceiling Abort Protocol (CAP) which is yet another modification on PCP. In the proposed CA-PCP, a silent period is defined to control the number of aborts. During the period, it is conditional abortable so as to make a balance between blocking and abort of the tasks dynamically based on the utilization of the systems in order to achieve a high schedulability. Performance study of the proposed protocol has been done through simulation. The performance results indicate that CA-PCP can significantly improve the performance of a system if the length of the abortable critical sections are well chosen. © 1997 IEEE.

0342756823	Reserved bandwidth video smoothing algorithm for MPEG transmission	MPEG video transmission will make up a significant portion of the workload on future computer networks. These variable bit rate (VBR) compressed videos are known to exhibit significant, multiple-time-scale bit rate variability. To such bursty traffic, it is always a compromise between providing a good quality of service (QoS) and a high utilization on the reserved bandwidth. One can utilize an optimal video smoothing algorithm as suggested in Salehi et al. (1996) to smooth out the data transmission from a server to a client so that the bandwidth utilization can be improved. However, such smoothing techniques concentrate their efforts on smoothing the transmission and worry less about resource requirements, maximum bandwidth needed and the overall bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we present a smoothing algorithm for transmitting stored MPEG-I video stream under a user-defined maximum network bandwidth. We also consider the impact of the startup latency, and the client's buffer size on the network utilization. Our algorithm differs from the others in that we do video smoothing under a pre-defined reserved bandwidth. At the cost of deleting some B-frames within a short period of time, the reserved bandwidth utilization can be improved dramatically without sacrificing much on the video quality.

0343826608	Multi-server video-on-demand system with arbitrary-rate playback support	In this paper, we propose a multi-server design for video-on-demand (VoD) systems that can provide different quality of service (QoS) guarantees by arbitrary-rate video playback. This design chooses a symmetric architecture that consists of a set of identically configured servers and supports arbitrary rates of video playback required by different clients in the following way. The playback requirements requested from all clients are first sent to the master server. If the master server decides to accept a new client, it distributes the task of the new client to all the servers, including itself. Through the pre-processing of the video streams, we can map the data of each frame of every video to a frame map. This frame map indicates whether a frame should be sent to the client at a given frame rate. In our multi-server design for a VoD system, using these frame maps and a suitable transmission schedule, a client can demand to play any video, at any playback rate and at any time. Furthermore, the VoD system provides a high degree of fault tolerance. This design not only can tolerate the failure of one or more servers, but also requires relatively small bandwidth capability or reservation for fault tolerance. In addition, this multi-server design can effectively overcome the hot spot problem of popular videos and keep the load balanced at the same time. Finally, we discuss how to generalize the proposed method for a large-scale VoD system with heterogeneous architecture.

84899456973	Scheduling temporal data for real-time requests in roadside-to-vehicle communication	Recent advances in wireless communication technologies have spawned many new applications in vehicular networks. Data dissemination via roadside-to-vehicle communication is a vital approach to enabling most of these applications. In this work, we investigate in the scenario where data items are broadcasted from the road-side unit (RSU) in response to requests submitted by passing vehicles. Data items are associated with temporal constraints and updated periodically to reflect dynamic states of traffic information. Each request may ask for multiple temporal data items, and it is associated with a deadline, which may either be specified by the driver or imposed by the time when the vehicle drives through the service region. In particular, we develop a real-time data dissemination model based on roadside-to-vehicle communication by formulating the time-constraint of requests and the consistency requirement of retrieving temporal data items. On this basis, we propose an online scheduling algorithm to enhance the system performance in terms of maximizing request service and improving bandwidth utilization. Lastly, we build a simulation model to evaluate the algorithm performance in a variety of situations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms significantly in both request serving and bandwidth utilization. © 2013 IEEE.

This chapter starts with some review of the state-of-the-art technologies. Positioning technologies propel the market of location-based services (LBS). They are mobile content services that provide location-related information to users. However, to enjoy these LBS services, the mobile user must explicitly expose his/her accurate location to the service provider, who might abuse such location information or even trade it to unauthorized parties. To protect privacy, traditional approaches require a trusted middleware on which user locations are anonanonymous ymized. This chapter presents two new privacy-preserving approaches without such a middleware. The first is a non-exposure location cloaking protocol where only relative distances are exchanged. The second is a protocol for nearest neighbor search with controlled location exposure. © 2010, IGI Global.

84903835456	Capturing and analyzing pervasive data for Smarthealth	In this paper, we study how mobile computing and wireless technologies can be explored to provide effective ubiquitous healthcare services. Instead of reinventing the wheels, we make use of smartphones, off-the-shelf components, and existing technologies in ubiquitous computing (i.e. wireless and mobile positioning technologies, and data acquisition techniques and processing via sensors) to develop a middleware, and tools for the development of systems and applications to provide effective ubiquitous healthcare services. Two main tasks to be studied are: 1) Developing a framework, called Smart Health, to provide the infrastructure and architectural support for realizing ubiquitous healthcare services, and 2) Designing and developing ubiquitous healthcare applications by utilizing the SmartHelath framework to let users experience and benefit from the provided services. We use scenarios to illustrate how mobile/wireless and sensor technologies can enable ubiquitous healthcare services in Smart Health. Some of the examples included in Smart Health are: location tracking, vital signs and well-being data acquisition and analysis, fall detection and behavior monitoring, and sleep analysis. As a start, based on the Smart Health framework, we introduce a smartphone app, called Smart Mood, for tracking the mood of patients who are suffering mood disorder (i.e., manic and depression) to demonstrate how Smart Health can effectively enable ubiquitous healthcare services. © 2014 IEEE.

84908636736	Towards scalable, fair and robust data dissemination via cooperative vehicular communications	Recent advances in infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications are envisioned to enable a variety of emerging applications in vehicular networks, where it is imperative to provide efficient data services via cooperative vehicular communications. In this work, we present the data dissemination system via cooperative I2V and V2V communications. We formulate the problem by investigating both the communication constraint and the application requirement on data dissemination. The goal is to maximize the system performance by exploiting the joint effects of I2V and V2V communications. On this basis, we propose an on-line scheduling algorithm to enable scalable, fair and robust data dissemination. The algorithm makes scheduling decisions by transforming the data dissemination problem to the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem and approximately solving MWIS using a greedy method. We build the simulation model based on realistic traffic and communication characteristics. A comprehensive simulation study demonstrates that the proposed solution is able to effectively strike a balance between I2V and V2V data services and maximize system performance in terms of scalability, fairness and robustness.

84915752051	Temporal data dissemination in vehicular cyber-physical systems	Efficient data dissemination is one of the fundamental requirements to enable emerging applications in vehicular cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we present the first study on real-time data services via roadside-to-vehicle communication by considering both the time constraint of data dissemination and the freshness of data items. Passing vehicles can submit their requests to the server, and the server disseminates data items accordingly to serve the vehicles within its coverage. Data items maintained in the database are periodically updated to keep the information up-to-date. We present the system model and analyze challenges on data dissemination by considering both application requirements and communication characteristics. On this basis, we formulate the temporal data dissemination (TDD) problem by introducing the snapshot consistency requirement on serving real-time requests for temporal data items. We prove that TDD is NP-hard by constructing a polynomial-time reduction from the Clique problem. Based on the analysis of the time bound on serving requests, we propose a heuristic scheduling algorithm, which considers the request characteristics of productivity, status, and urgency in scheduling. An extensive performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is able to effectively exploit the broadcast effect, improve the bandwidth efficiency, and enhance the request service chance.

0347705497	A conditional abortable priority ceiling protocol for scheduling mixed real-time tasks	Priority Ceiling Protocol (PCP) is a well-known resource access protocol for hard real-time systems. However, it has a problem of ceiling blocking which imposes a great hindrance to task scheduling in mixed real-time systems where tasks may have different criticality. In this paper, a new resource access protocol called the Conditional Abortable Priority Ceiling Protocol (CA-PCP) is proposed. It resolves the problem of ceiling blocking by incorporating a conditional abort scheme into the PCP. The new protocol inherits all the desirable properties of the PCP and the Ceiling Abort Protocol (CAP) which is yet another modification of the PCP. In the proposed protocol, a condition is defined to control the abort of a job so that the schedulability of the system will not be affected. Performance study has been done to compare the CA-PCP with the PCP. The results indicate that CA-PCP can significantly improve the performance of a system if the lengths of the abortable critical sections are well chosen. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.
