33748105789	Characterization and osteoblast-like cell compatibility of porous scaffolds: Bovine hydroxyapatite and novel hydroxyapatite artificial bone	Three different porous scaffolds were tested. The first two were prepared by sintering bovine bone. The third scaffold was prepared using three-dimensional gel-lamination, a new rapid prototyping method, and was named as hydroxyapatite artificial bone. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed that the samples were mainly highly crystalline hydroxyapatite ceramics. Scanning electron microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry measurement showed that the pores were interconnected and pore sizes ranged from several microns to hundreds of microns. Mouse osteoblast-like cells grown on the three scaffolds retained their characteristic morphology. Cell proliferation and differentiation, analyzed by methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) and alkaline phosphatase activity assays, were significantly higher on the hydroxyapatite artificial bone than on the other two scaffolds tested. All the scaffolds provided good attachment, proliferation and differentiation of bone cells. These results indicate that the scaffolds have a favorable interaction with cells, they support cell growth and functions, and therefore these scaffolds may have great potential as bone substitutes. The three-dimensional gel-lamination method is proven to be an attractive process to design and fabricate bone scaffolds with favorable properties, and therefore, has promising potential for bone repair applications. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2006.

33947209002	Physicochemical and mechanical properties of composite of chltosan microspheres/calcium phosphate cement	The aim of this work is to improve the mechanical properties of calcium phosphate bone cement (CPC) by appending chitosan microspheres to CPC base. That chitosan degrades rapidly than bone cement has been proved by previous investigations. Porous CPC has low compressive strength because of the pores in it weakening the structure. Additive chitosan microspheres can improve the mechanical properties by bearing the compress with the CPC base and produce pores after degradation, This study investigates the effect of chitosan microspheres on the setting time, mechanical properties, phase evolution and morphology of CPC. The additive proportion of chitosan microspheres ranges from 0 wt% to 30 wt%. Compared with original CPC, the modified CPC has higher compressive strength, without significantly affecting the chemical properties. The phase composition of the CPC is tested by XRD. The microstructures of CPC are observed using SEM. The final setting times range from 5-15 minutes and can be modulated by using different liquid and powder (L/P) ratio.

33947230661	Preparation and characterization of biodegradable β-TCP-based composite microspheres as bone tissue engineering scaffolds	Since a small globular particle was first used as support for three-dimensional (3D) growth of anchorage-dependent cells in suspended cultures, a variety of microspheres as tissue engineering scaffolds have been developed. In this paper, β-TCP and chitosan were selected as the components of microspheres due to their biodegradability and osteogenic properties. The biodegradable β-TCP/chitosan composite microspheres were prepared by a solid-in-water-in-oil (s/w/o) emulsion cross-linking method in this paper. The size distribution, surface morphology, and microstructure of the microspheres were evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the size of the microspheres with good spherical morphology was distributed in the range of 50-200μm. In vitro immersion experiments were carried out to evaluate the degradability of the microspheres, and the results demonstrated that the chitosan/β-TCP composite microspheres were potential materials as tissue engineering scaffolds for bone repair.

33947281545	MicroCT aided scaffold design and preparation	Bone repair method has run to a new stage of bone tissue engineering. Doctors use bone scaffold to fill bone trauma and expect human regeneration ability to reconstruct bone trauma while bone is degrading. Scaffold is essential to bone tissue engineering. Scaffold should introduce new bone with scaffold's conduction channel. But it's still very difficult for scaffold to mimic fine structure of bone. Ideal scaffold should have similar component and microstructure to natural bone, which makes it more biocompatible and better to reconstructed bone. So we forward microCT aided design and preparation to solve this problem. MicroCT outputs both shape and three-dimensional internal density information. Then, we build computer model of scaffold with acquired microstructure. We fabricate scaffold that mimics natural bone by 3D rapid prototype machine.

But it is compact in structure and short of cavity, which limits new bone growing into CHA bone cement. In this paper, the foaming method was adopted to prepare the porous CHA. The setting time, compressive strength, porosity and pore size of the CHA were examined. The phase composition of the CHA was tested with XRD and FT-IR. The microstructure of the CHA was observed with SEM. The results show that setting time of 7-19 minutes, compressive strength of 26-32MPa, pore size of 100-200nm, porosity of 50-60%.

34250330362	Microarchitectural and mechanical characteristics of biomimetic bone tissue engineering scaffolds fabricated by rapid prototyping technique	Aim: To evaluate the three-dimensional (3D) microarchitectural and mechanical biomimetic characteristics of porous biophasic calcium phosphate (BCP) ceramic scaffold with micro CT imaging and mechanical testing. Methods: The experiment was carried out at the state key laboratory of new ceramic and fine processing of Tsinghua University, the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Orthopaedic Institute of General Hospital of Chinese PLA between June 2004 and December 2005. Biomimetic BCP scaffolds were fabricated with 3D gel-lamination technique and foaming methods. Then these BCP scaffolds were scanned using a desktop MicroCT system with an isotropic voxel dimension of 20 μm. 3D structural parameters were calculated using built-in software. So was done with the cancellous bone samples harvested from the load-bearing region of femoral head (provided by osseous tissue bank of General Hospital of Chinese PLA, and the donation consent was signed) of youth with acute brain death. Finally, compression tests were applied on both the BCP scaffolds from two directions-along the axis and vertical to the axis, and the cancellous bone samples. Compressive strength and elastic modulus were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed on these structural and mechanical data. Results: 1 The mean trabecular plate thickness (Tb. Th) and trabecular separation (Tb. Sp) of the scaffolds' struts were less than those of the cancellous bone (P < 0.05). The trabecular number (Tb.N) and degree of anisotropy (DA) of the scaffolds were more than those of the bone samples (P < 0.05). It indicated that the trabecular scaffold showed more obviously anisotropic feature. 2 Whereas, no significant difference was demonstrated in bone volume fraction (BV/TV), bone surface/bone volume ratio (BS/BV) and structure model index (SMI) (P > 0.05) between the scaffolds and the cancellous bone samples. Both groups of samples represented an obvious plate-like model. 3 The mechanical test showed that the average compressive modulus and ultimate strength along the axis of the scaffolds were larger than those vertical to the axis (P < 0.05) which demonstrated the oriented feature of scaffolds. Although the ultimate strength along the axis of the scaffolds was lower than that of bone samples, but the modulus was only 20% higher than that of the bone samples (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The BCP scaffolds have good mimetic properties in porosity and surface area that was advantageous to cell attachment and ingrowth. The oriented feature of the scaffolds improved the strength along the struts array and the modulus was close to normal trabecular bone that demonstrated a good biomechanical compatibility.

Optical microscope is often used to inspect implant slices but may destroy original status when slicing up. We tried 3D high resolution CT to nondestructively study biocompatibility and degradation of bio-ceramics implants. 3D CT provides 3D structure information. Typical pixel size of 3D high resolution CT is 50 microns. Generally, implants differs with tissues in density and structure, on basis of which we can identify details with CT slice. Experiments of bio-ceramic implanted into rabbit hip are also showed. Interaction could be identified at interface between implant and tissue.

The HA/PHB composites were prepared by ball milling, hot-pressing, the HA content were 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30wt%, respectively. Silane coupling agent was used for HA surface treatment in HA/PHB composites to compare with not having HA surface treatment in HA/PHB composite materials. The impact strength and flexural strength of HA / PHB composites were tested, and the microstructure of the fracture surface was observed by SEM. The results showed that HA could enhance the bending strength of HA/PHB composites. With HA content increased, the bending strength increased first and then decreased, when the HA content was 10wt%, the maximum bending strength reached 32.74MPa, increased about 41% comparing with pure PHB. Silane coupling agent can improve the interface of HA / PHB, then enhance the mechanical strength. When the HA content was 15wt%, the maximum bending strength reached 46.6MPa, Increased about 56% comparing with the same proportion of untreated HA/PHB composite material, and about double comparing with pure PHB. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.

Chitosan microspheres were selected as the base materials because of their excellent properties for biomedical applications. But their smooth surfaces were not adapted for cell attachment. Hence, in order to improve the roughness of chitosan microspheres, β-TCP/chitosan composite microspheres were developed. From SEM photographs, the coarse surfaces of composite microspheres were observed, there were some ceramic particles standing out of the chitosan matrix. And their roughness measured by profilometers was about 2.0 μm. Mouse MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were seeded on the microspheres for evaluating the attachment interaction between cells and materials. According to the ESEM photographs and MTT assay, the adherence and proliferation of osteoblasts on the surfaces of modified microspheres were better than those on the chitosan microspheres, which were mainly attributed to the improved roughness of surface. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

78651080413	Micro-CT-based bone ceramic scaffolding and its performance after seeding with mesenchymal stem cells for repair of load-bearing bone defect in canine femoral head	Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a debilitating and painful orthopedic condition characterized by joint collapse. Salvage of the femoral head is highly desirable to preserve the contour and mechanical properties and prevent joint collapse. This study aimed to develop a new tissue-engineering approach for treatment of large bone defect in femoral head, that is, after osteonecrosis. The biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) ceramic scaffolds were fabricated by a 3D gel-lamination technique based on micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images of the cancellous bone microarchitecture of femoral heads. After seeding with autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in vitro, the cell-scaffold composite was implanted into a bone defect surgically induced in canine femoral head via trapdoor procedure, which was a common procedure for treatment of osteonecrosis. A total of 24 adult dogs were randomly divided into three groups (n = 8 each) for implantation of the BCP scaffold with or without with BMSCs, and also the autologous bone chips for comparisons. All animals were sacrificed at 30 weeks postoperatively and processed for radiological and histological evaluations. The contour of the femoral head was well preserved with implantation of BCP scaffolds with or without BMSCs, whereas joint collapse was found after treatment with autologous bone chips. The osteointegration and new bone formation was significantly greater with BCP scaffold implantation with than without BMSC seeding and showed greater strength and compressive modulus in the repair site. Micro-CT-based bone ceramic scaffolds seeding with BMSC might be a promising way to repair bone defects in the femoral head. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A 1 mm infiltration depth into the presintered alumina at 1150°C, 1200°C and 1250°C required 95 min, 22 min and 8 min, respectively. Conclusion: An optimal infiltrating time required to reach a suitable infiltration depth into the presintered alumina was observed at 1200°C, an important finding for clinical applications at this commonly used furnace temperature. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

0035494748	Partner selection strategies based on part similarity and CCA data evaluation	Partner selection strategies are proposed based on the part similarity and CCA (cost/capability/available) data. The strategy can identify enterprises whose products do not meet the key characteristics needed by the designer so they should not be partners in the virtual enterprises. Part similarity evaluation is more efficient for evaluating partner selection. However, the part similarity algorithm can not ensure that the selected partner is the most reasonable because it evaluates product similarities only. A more robust algorithm for evaluating the CCA data using AHP, which takes more technical terms into account, makes sure that the selected partners are more reasonable for the virtual enterprise.

0036120944	Preparation and characterization of hydroxyapatite suspensions for solid freeform fabrication	A comparative investigation on particle size, zeta potential and rheology behavior of suspensions of hydroxyapatite (HA) powders produced by a wet-chemical synthesis method is presented. Results have shown that temperature and soaking time of the calcination process significantly affects the HA particle size, and results in a reduction of the zeta potential and suspension viscosity. On the basis of the present experimental and calculated results, the reduction in the viscosity is attributed to a higher repulsion barrier in interparticle potential. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. and Techna.

0036586988	Fast 3-D reconstruction of CT images using a geometric parameter table	Excessive computation cost is one of the major reasons hindering wider use of three dimensional direct image reconstruction in computed topography (CT). The problem is more severe in industrial computed topography (ICT) because ICT seldom utilizes specially designed hardware. This paper presents a geometric parameter lookup table method for fast implementation of the FDK (Feldkame-Davis-Kress) algorithm using periodic functions, i.e., the backprojection addresses and weights are calculated in advance. Therefore, the lookup only occurs in the backprojection. The table avoids repeated calculations in the FDK algorithm, reducing the calculation burden to a level that a PC can perform well. Pre-interpolation and nearest neighbor interpolation are utilized to avoid repeated interpolations. The effect of pre-interpolation on the image quality is investigated. This method was implemented on an X-CT system (BCT-4), the experimental results show that the method is practical.

0036430884	Piezoelectric behavior of biomaterials	The beginning of piezoelectric behavior research involving biomaterials was traced to the 1950s with the discovery of the appearance of a voltage on bone surfaces by application of a shearing force along the bone axis. Since that time, many investigations have been performed on the piezoelectric response of bone, tendon and other collagenous tissues. The piezoelectric effects are believed to be significant to the growth and repair of biological tissues. Research on the application of piezoelectric materials as implant is being actively investigated. These materials, including ceramics and polymers, have dominated the application. This paper makes an attempt to survey and discuss the advances and trends in the developments and applications of the piezoelectric effects in biomaterials.

0036432419	Preparation and design of artificial bone scaffolds via a three-dimensional gel-lamination process	A new method to make customized artificial bone was developed. At first, the structural information of the natural bone was collected using x-ray computed-tomography (X-CT). And then the information was simplified and reconstructed into three-dimensional images. Subsequently bone scaffold for bone tissue engineering was produced using a three-dimensional gel-lamination system. In addition, much concern has been given to the choice of gelling system and the formulation of ceramic slurry. Sodium alginate and calcium chloride were adopted to meet the desired requirement. Small amount of alumina was added to the hydroxyapatite (HA) suspensions for improvement of the rheological properties and maximization of the solids loading, so that a well-dispersed, non-agglomerated ceramic slurry can be made.

0036498102	Morphological behavior of osteoblast-like cells on surface-modified titanium in vitro	In recent papers, we reported the results of a study on the graded porous titanium coatings on titanium by plasma spraying and amino-group ion implantation. The paper is to preliminarily evaluate the biocompatibility of surface-modified titanium through 2, 5 and 7 days cell culture in vitro. Cell morphology was observed by a scanning electron microscope. Cell proliferation and type I collagen synthesis were measured by 3(4,5-dimethyl-thiazole-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Our experimental results showed that osteoblast-like cells attached and spread well on surface-modified titanium. Cells were observed to grow into the pores and form extracellular matrix. MTT and ELISA results showed no detrimental effect on the development of cell. These studies support the biocompatibility of surface-modified titanium. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

80054017713	Effects of surface treatment on the microstructural and crystallographic changes of dental 3Y-TZP ceramic	Objective: To investigate the effects of different surface treatments on the microstructural and crystallographic changes of dental 3Y-TZP ceramics. Methods: 21 pieces of zirconia specimens (15 × 15 × 1.5 mm) were prepared and divided into 7 groups: control group; grinding group; polishing group; sandblasting group; sandblasting + veneer porcelain sintering group; sandblasting + veneer porcelain sintering twice group and sandblasting + annealing group. The crystal structure of specimen was monitored by X-ray diffraction (XRD) before morphological observation with scanning electron microscope. Results: monoclinic phase increased after grinding while decreased little after polishing, bigger phase change presented after sandblasting compared with decreased phase change induced by veneer porcelain sintering; annealing eradicated the surface m phase. Grinding produced coarse scratches on the surface of samples with removal of surface particles; after grinding and polishing to 7 um level, the surface particles were removed massively, and the surface became smooth with remaining scare scratches and substantial micro cracks. Sandblasting removed scratches near completely producing coarse and irregular surface of samples. Conclusions: Grinding, sandblasting and polishing could produce the transition of Zirconia Ceramic surface from t to m phase. It is better to use heat treatment after mechanical treatment to reverse the changed surface phase. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

80054018762	Microstructure of interface between zirconia and veneer porcelain	Objective: To study whether the veneering technique will have an impact on zirconia grain and the bonding type and relationship on interface between zirconia and veneer porcelain. Materials and methods: After sintered, zirconia was annealed for 15 minute to finish the phase transition from m to t.4 types of veneer porcelains were sintered and observed with SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and TEM (transmission electron microscopy). Results: With etching time extending, it appeared that many materials loosed and corrosional pit deepened, enlarged in the veneer porcelain, which made crystallize structure move into veneering surface. Composition of interface mainly was amorphous glass matrix and zirconia. Energy spectrum analysis showed that there was no remnant glass composition in the zirconia side departing from interface. SEM showed that crystal in veneering side did not participate interface bonding. Conclusion: The interface between 4 types of veneer porcelains and zirconia bonded well. Veneering sintering technique didn't change lattice structure of zirconia, which still was tetragonal structure. The specific bonding property of interface still remained to be analyzed further to determine. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

84862736669	Effects of the mechanical properties of veneering porcelain on stress distribution of dental zirconia layered structure: A finite element model study	The purpose of this study was to study effects of the mechanical properties of veneering porcelain on stress distribution of dental zirconia layered structure by three-dimensional finite element analysis. A 3-D geometric model of the first maxillary molar was established, a tooth preparation was simulated by the Imageware software. A crown was designed and divided into three layers: core, middle layer and outer veneer layer. The elasticity modulus of the middle layer was 70GPa for the control model up to 175GPa for the tested models. Loads of 200N were applied over a 1 mm diameter area beneath the tip of the mesial-distal cusp, simulating typical occlusal contact areas, the stress distribution of the crown systems were analyzed. Results show that within the geometry of the crown configuration, one concentration district of maximum principal stress occurred on the occlusal surface closely proximal to the loading position, several sub-maximum principal stress area were observed, such as margin regions of the mesial face, lingual face, distal faces, buccal face and occlusal fossa. Middle layer with higher modulus can effectively disperse the stress concentration in the layered zirconia all-ceramic crown system. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

84862747917	Matching ability of dental shaded zirconia ceramics and veneering porcelain	The matching thermal properties of ceramics and veneering porcelain play an important role for the overall color and mechanical properties of dental crowns. The Vita VM9 veneering porcelain was coated on the surfaces of two zirconia, three-point flexural strength, heat shock resistance and the overall color after veneered with porcelain were tested. The results showed that the interlayer cracks, radial cracks or porcelain body cracks were not appeared in all samples during thermal shock at 60∼220°C. Their flexural strength was all above 700MPa and the overall color covered the common color of VITA-3D Master shade guide. There is good thermal compatibility between the two dental shaded zirconia ceramics and Vita VM9 veneering porcelain. The mechanical properties of shaded zirconia are suitable for clinical posterior teeth area restorative, and the overall color is also suitable for the requirements on the color and brightness of clinical dental restoration. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

84862747918	Influence of low temperature aging on the flexural strength of Y-TZP ceramics	Low temperature aging (LTD) is an important factor of Y-TZP ceramic as artificial joint femoral head and dental restorative materials in vivo for long-term application. In this paper, the accelerated aging experiments on Y-TZP ceramics were conducted. The t-m phase transition is occurring from the surface to the inside during low temperature aging of Y-TZP ceramics. As content of phase transformation increases, thickness of phase transformation layer increases. While the content of surface monoclinic phase is less, the volume expansion and surface stress caused by phase transformation can make cracks and holes shrink or even close, then the flexural strength increase. As a large number of surface monoclinic phase was generated, due to there are a lot of microscopic defects in the phase transition layer, crystals loose, strength of grain boundary lower than that of not aging area and phase transformation layers fracture in the intergranular mode, that damages the flexural strength. Therefore, the flexural strength increases firstly and then decrease with the increase of surface monoclinic content. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

84885692654	Biomedical engineering in surgical repair of osteonecrosis: The role of imaging technology	We fabricated biomimetic biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) for tissue engineering in repair of avascular necrosis (AVN) or osteonecrosis (ON) and observed its outcome of reconstructiion in ON femoral head of dogs. Firstly, BCP ceramic scaffolds were fabricated with three-dimensional (3D) gel-lamination technique according to the two-dimensional (2D) images of trabecular structure of dog femoral head. Then, the 3D structure of the scaffolds was scanned and reconstructed using micro-CT for characterization of 3D patterns of its material structure related to trabecular parameters, including bone volume fraction (BVF-BV/TV), bone surface/bone volume (BS/BV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp), structure model index (SMI), and trabecular pattern factor (Tb.Pf). After coatingmarrowstromal cells (MSCs) as seed cells onto biomimetic porous BCP constructed in vitro, the tissue-engineered bones were implanted into the bony defects of dog femoral head through trap-door procedure for 30 weeks. The femoral heads in control group were compacted with autograft bone chips for comparison. Results showed similar micro-CT data between control samples and experimental group implanted with BCP scaffolds, except that a more plate-like trabecular was pattern found in BCP scaffolds. Thirty weeks after operation, the contour and integrity of the femoral heads were basically maintained and the BCP scaffold showed trabecular bone formation and integration. On the other hand, the femoral heads in control group collapsed and presented osteoarthritic changes. These findings suggested that the biomimetic porous BCP scaffolds developed for this study coated with MSCs might be an effective approach in repair of the bony defect in ON of the femoral head. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

11344273866	Effect of repeated firings on the color stability of dental computer aided design/computer aided manufacture infiltration alumina core ceramic and veneering porcelain complex	Aim: To assay the influence of repeated firings on the color stability of the glass infiltration alumina core ceramic and veneering porcelain complex and to provide experimental basis for clinical application. Methods: Dental computer aided design (CAD)/computer aided manufacture (CAM) alumina block was infiltrated by AG2 and Vita In-Ceram AL2 color serials of infiltration glass powder made by ourselves. Basal specimens were made by size 10 mm × 10 min × 1 mm. Vitadur Alpha B2 color opaque dentine and dentine-veneering porcelain were added to these core ceramics. Specimens were sintered up to 8 times. Color results were measured by Minolta CR-321 colorimeter. The samples before and after sintering were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results: There was little influence on the color of the two color groups of core ceramics by repeated firings. When the core ceramics were veneered, color changes were observed between the first firing cycle and the second firing cycle, these color changes were: light value was decreased, b value and chroma were increased, the change of hue was little. While after the third firing, little color change was found. Crystal phase structure was observed in the veneering porcelain after 8 times of sintering. Conclusion: There is little influencing on the basal color of infiltration alumina core ceramic after repeated firings. The color changes of the core ceramic were mainly observed between the first firing cycle and the second firing cycle. The color of infiltration alumina core ceramic and the core veneered porcelain complex are relatively stable after repeated firing cycles at clinic condition.

13844299628	Bone and artificial bone internal structure study with high resolution 3D CT	Bioceramic materials have been widely used in the clinics in recent years. They are mainly fabricated as the substitution of human hard tissue. As a medical implant, those that have similar structure to human bone have better biocompatibility and osteoinductional property. So it is necessary to study internal structure of bone and compare structures of human bone and artificial bone. X-ray CT is an important and powerful tool in industrial imaging for obtaining the shape and dimensional information of industrial part, yielding the images with superior resolution and dimensional accuracy. CT image represents density of actual bone. It can get bone microstructure and trabecula distribution, which greatly improves our knowledge of trabecula structure. Several hundreds of slices are available after a single scan. Its typical pixel and slice distance is 100 microns, much higher than helical CT systems. On one hand, CT image is the basis of artificial bone design and manufacture; on the other hand, it can be used for both scientific study and diagnosis. In this study, femoral head experiments are performed to illustrate its bright application future. Slice is showed in figure 1. 3-D images of femoral head are displayed (Fig.2,Fig.3). Experimental results showed 3D CT improves much our knowledge of bone internal structure.
