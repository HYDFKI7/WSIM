84937010670	Investigation of the effect of a bumpy base on granular segregation and transport properties under vertical vibration	This study experimentally investigates the effect of a bumpy base on the Brazil-nut phenomenon in a vertically vibrated granular bed. The rise dynamics of an intruder is determined by the particle tracking method. The results indicate that the rise time increases with an increase in the base roughness, and the variation of the rise time with different base factors is more pronounced with smaller vibration acceleration and higher vibration frequency. A theoretical model is employed to measure the penetration length of the intruder and the drag force between the intruder and the immersed beads. The penetration length is reduced and the drag force is enhanced with surface roughness of the base. Additionally, the transport properties of the vibrated glass beads are also measured and discussed. With greater base roughness, the strength of the diffusive and convective motion is reduced leading to a weaker Brazil-nut effect.

18844457068	Wet granular materials in sheared flows	The transport properties of wet granular materials in a shear cell apparatus have been studied. If the particles are wet, the flow becomes more viscous forming liquid bridges between particles. The dynamic liquid bridge forces are considered as the cohesive forces between particles to restrict their movements. The cohesive forces make the particles stick tighter with each other and hamper the movement of particles. The mixing and transport properties are influenced seriously by the amount of moisture added in the flow. This paper discusses a series of experiments performed in a shear cell device with five different moisture contents using 3-mm glass spheres as the granular materials. The motion of granular materials was recorded by a high-speed camera. Using the image processing technology and particle tracking method, the average and fluctuation velocities in the streamwise and transverse directions could be measured. The self-diffusion coefficient could be found from the history of the particle displacements. The self-diffusion coefficients and fluctuations in the streamwise direction were much larger than those in the transverse direction. Three bi-directional stress gages were installed to the upper wall to measure the normal and shear stresses of the granular materials along the upper wall. For wetter granular material flows, the fluctuation velocities and the self-diffusion coefficients were smaller. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

21744454661	Particle mixing in a sheared granular flow	Mixing experiments were performed in a shear cell device using differently colored but otherwise identical glass spheres, with five different bottom wall velocities. The motions of the granular materials were recorded by a high-speed camera, so the development of mixing boundaries could be analyzed from the images. By continually tracking the movements of particles, the velocity, fluctuations and the granular temperatures were measured. The self-diffusion coefficients were determined from the histories of particles movements. The mixing layer thicknesses were compared with the calculations from a simple diffusion equation using the data of self-diffusion coefficients obtained from the current measurements. The calculations and experimental results showed good agreements, demonstrating that the mixing process of granular materials occurred through the diffusion mechanism. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

0030391593	Heaping phenomenon of particles in a shaker	According to the levels of vibrational acceleration amplitude, different motion states may appear in a vibrated granular bed, including heaping, coherent, expansion, wave and arching. The heaping phenomena of sands or granular materials are well-known, but the internal physics is still unclear. This paper experimentally studies the heaping phenomenon in a vertical shaker. Heaping phenomenon occurs in a shaker when the vibrational acceleration amplitude is greater than 1.2 gravitational accelerations. In addition to the vibrational acceleration amplitude, particle properties (diameter, density and repose angle) and container sizes (width and bed initial height) are used as controlling parameters to investigate the heaping phenomenon.

According to the levels of the amplitude of vibration acceleration, the particle motion phenomena may have the following convective types: heaping, coherent, expansion, wave and arching. This paper studied the arching phenomena of granular materials in a vertical shaker. The arching motions were investigated by high speed photography and image processing technology. The velocity fields of the granular materials during vibration were calculated from the recorded images. The ensemble averaged velocities in horizontal and vertical directions were close to 0. The velocity fluctuations were also measured. The ensemble averaged granular temperature was increased with the amplitude of the vibration acceleration, however, the variation of granular temperature in horizontal direction with acceleration is not significant due to the existing sidewalls.

0031700957	Granular bed filter technology	The application of granular bed filters in high temperature flue gas cleaning is discussed. These filters provide a method for continuous operation when combined with circulation and regeneration of the filter material. The cross-flow moving bed granular filter, which combines the advantages of granular filtration and the benefits of continuous operation, has been seriously considered for use in hot flue gas cleaning and, indeed, is the basis for a number of industrial applications. This paper contains an extensive coverage of the literature on fixed and moving bed filtration of aerosols; some designs and collection performance are described in detail. Due to current interest in commercialization of this environmental technology, we also review and evaluate the development status of granular bed filters facilities for environmental protection from the marketing perspectives.

0031238628	Segregation phenomena in a shaker	The segregation phenomena of different binary mixtures were studied experimentally in a vertical shaker. The larger particles tend to move upwards in the shaker in a certain range of vibrational accelerations. The segregation effect was more significant for the mixture with a larger size difference. The segregation coefficient was measured and found to increase with vibrational acceleration until reaching a maximum and then to decrease with acceleration. The bed expansion height was also measured. It was found that the greatest segregation effect occurred when the bed transformed from a dense state to a loose state.

0031247185	Flight time and gap of deep granular bed in a shaker	When a granular bed moves in a vertical shaker, the particles may leave the base plate causing the formation of a gap. The different flight times result in different types of motion phenomena. The flight time and the maximum gap are experimentally measured by a set of image processing system in this study. A simple mathematical model for a completely inelastic bouncing ball is borrowed to calculate the flight time and gap which are compared with the experimental data. This model slightly over predicts the experimental results because of some assumptions. The displacements of the bed and the base plate are computed and analyzed. At some ranges of vibrational accelerations, there may exist two different flight times and the phenomenon is called bifurcation. The calculated results show that there are several kinds of motion behaviors in the bed and the results are similar to the experimental observations.

0032045149	Stagnant zones in granular moving bed filters for flue gas cleanup	The flow patterns in three symmetric and two asymmetric louver-walled granular moving bed systems are studied experimentally. The flow pattern histories of granular solids in moving beds were recorded by videocamera throughout the whole test period. The image processing system including a frame grabber was used. Selected discrete images showing the flow pattern development were digitized and stored in files. Individual granular flow frames show a development of quasi-stagnant zones close to the louvered walls, the shear zones and a central flow region with width depending on the louver angle. The vertical shift of one or the other louvered wall in asymmetric configuration considerably influences the history of quasi-stagnant zones.

0032303184	Kinetic theory analysis of thermal conductivity in granular material flows	The effective thermal conductivity is developed by employing the dense-gas kinetic theory. The free path used in the theory varies with the particle velocity. The analytical results can be used for the whole range of the product of Biot number and Fourier number provided that the Biot number is less than 0.1. For the very small Biot-Fourier numbers, the conductivities are found to increase with the particle diameters and the square root of granular temperatures. For the limit of very large Biot-Fourier numbers, the two effective-thermal conductivities are found to be linearly proportional to the granular temperature.

The velocity fluctuations were also measured. The ensemble average granular temperature increases with the amplitude of the vibration acceleration, however, the variation of granular temperature with the acceleration in the horizontal direction is not as significant due to the existing side walls.

0032598051	Behaviors of sand flow in flask for the expendable pattern casting process	In the expendable pattern casting (EPC) molding process, sands were properly transported and compacted around the coated patterns by means of vibration. Difficulty arose for the case when it was necessary to transport molding sands into long horizontal cavities to form sand cores. The significant resistance and interlocking among sand particles often cause faults in casting due to incomplete compaction, while an over drastic vibration might cause distortion of the replicas. The behavior of sand motion in flask thus played an important role in designing mold cavities and in making decisions regarding molding conditions. The velocities and directions of sand motion in flask were different from point to point, depending on vibration conditions and the geometry of the flask. As the vibration processed, a layer of sand with a certain thickness near the surface flowed from the center outward to the flask wall, while in the region of 5 to 20 cm beneath surface, sands contracted inward to the center. At further depth, sand settled down steadily to the bottom along the wall. There existed an optimum stratum depth, at which the motion of sand in the horizontal direction approached a maximum value, and thus might meet the needs of sand transported into long cavities. The object of this paper is to investigate the behavior of sand flow in flask. Experimental results indicated that two-dimensional vibration, including the vertical direction, at resonance frequencies might greatly increase the fluidity of sand. The strength of sand flow depended on the acceleration level and the frequencies of the vibration system. With 2- and/or 3-dimensional vibration with sufficiently large gaps between sand and flask wall, air may be entrapped and form bubbles, these bubbles fluctuating drastically in the region near the free surface and blast out. The formation of bubbling is described in this paper.

0032621424	Fluctuations and self-diffusion of sheared granular material flows	Experiments were performed in a shear cell device with adjustable lower wall velocity. Glass spheres with a mean diameter of 3 mm were used as granular materials. Image processing technology and a particle tracking method were employed to measure the average and fluctuation velocities in the streamwise and the transverse directions. Because of gravitation force, the flows consist of both a solid-like region with higher and more uniform velocities in the lower test section and a fluid-like region in the upper part. The velocity fluctuations were anisotropic and were greater in the streamwise direction. By tracking the movements of particles continually, the variation in the mean-square diffusive displacements with time was plotted and the self-diffusion coefficient was determined. The self-diffusion coefficients in the streamwise direction were much higher than those in the transverse direction. The dependence of the diffusion coefficients on the velocity fluctuations and the shear rate were discussed.

The larger particles tend to move upwards and the smaller particles move downwards due to particle reorganization. The maximum segregation ratios at different vibration acceleration amplitudes were measured and analyzed. The segregation coefficients and the vertical velocities of the larger and the smaller particles were also measured. The segregation coefficient is increased with time until reaching a maximum value. The segregation rate and the velocities (absolute values) of the larger and the smaller particles are decreased with time, and finally become zero.

27144431911	Velocity measurements in dry granular avalanches using particle image velocimetry technique and comparison with theoretical predictions	Velocity and depth are crucial field variables to describe the dynamics of avalanches of sand or soil or snow and to draw conclusions about their flow behavior. In this paper we present new results about velocity measurements in granular laboratory avalanches and their comparison with theoretical predictions. Particle image velocimetry measurement technique is introduced and used to measure the dynamics of the velocity distribution of free surface and unsteady flows of avalanches of non-transparent quartz particles down a curved chute merging into a horizontal plane from initiation to the runout zone. Velocity distributions at the free surface are determined and in one case also at the bottom from below. Also measured is the settlement of the avalanche in the deposit. For the theoretical prediction we consider the model equations proposed by Pudasaini and Hutter [J. Fluid Mech. 495, 193 (2003)]. A nonoscillatory central differencing total variation diminishing scheme is implemented to integrate these model equations. It is demonstrated that the theory, numerics, and experimental observations are in excellent agreement. These results can be applied to estimate impact pressures exerted by avalanches on defence structures and infrastructures along the channel and in runout zones. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.

27644577583	Mixing in vibrated granular beds with the effect of electrostatic force	In this study, the DEM (Discrete Elementary Method) is used to simulate the behavior of granular mixing in vibrated beds. First, the velocity fields are simulated by the DEM model to examine the convective currents in a three-dimensional vibrated granular bed. Then, in order to characterize the effect of electrostatic force on the granular flow, the electrostatic number Es is defined as the ratio of the electrostatic force to the particle weight. Also, to quantify the quality of mixing, the mixing degree M is used by the well-known Lacey index. The top-bottom and the side-side initial loading patterns of two groups of glass bead with different colors are employed to investigate the influence of the convective currents on the granular mixing. To simplify the electrostatic effect, these two groups of glass beads are given opposite charges and the charged strength is assumed to be constant. The simulation results demonstrate that the granular temperatures increase linearly with the increasing Es number. Meanwhile, the mixing rate constants, calculated from the time evolutions of mixing degree, increase with the increasing Es number in power law relations. The role of granular temperature in the granular mixing is also discussed in this paper. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

2942748090	Placement of flow-corrective elements in a moving granular bed with louvered-walls	The existence of stagnant zones in granular moving bed systems with louvered-walls cause major technical problems, especially in the filtration and adsorption processes. In this paper, we proposed the method of placement of flow-corrective elements in the moving bed to diminish the stagnant zones near the louvers. We experimentally studied the flow patterns and the velocity fields of filter granules in symmetric louver-walled moving bed systems with placement of a series of flow-corrective elements. The white PE beads were used as filter granules and colored PE beads served as tracer particles. Filter granules were discharged from and circulated to the bed. The image processing system was used to record the granular flow. A mixing experiment was performed to show that the moving bed can be processed in two separated parts with different filter granules. The observations of flow patterns showed that the placement of the flow-corrective elements diminishes the stagnant zone efficiently. The velocity fields in the moving bed were also measured. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33746216680	Fluidization of a vertically vibrated two-dimensional hard sphere packing: A granular meltdown	We report measurements of the fluidization process in vertically vibrated two-dimensional granular packings. An initially close packed granular bed is exposed to sinusoidal container oscillations with gradually increasing amplitude. At first the particles close to the free surface become mobile. When a critical value of the forcing strength is reached the remaining crystal suddenly breaks up and the bed fluidizes completely. This transition leads to discontinuous changes in the density distribution and in the root mean square displacement of the individual particles. Likewise the vertical center of mass coordinate increases by leaps and bounds at the transition. It turns out that the maximum container velocity v0 is the crucial driving parameter determining the state of a fully fluidized system. For particles of various sizes the transition to full fluidization occurs at the same value of v02/gd, where d is the particle diameter and g is the gravitational acceleration. A discontinuous fluidization transition is only observed when the particles are highly elastic. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33746276731	The effect of liquid viscosity on sheared granular flows	This work investigates the effect of transport properties in sheared granular flows with adding different silicone oils. We performed a series of experiments in a shear cell device using 2-mm soda lime beads as the granular materials by adding little amount of different silicone oils. The viscosity of silicone oils added was changed in different tests. By particle tracking method, the velocities, the velocity fluctuations and the self-diffusion coefficients were measured and analyzed. It was found that for the granular system with adding the more viscous silicone oil, the system became less active due to the greater shear force and cohesive force, which resulted in the decrease of velocity fluctuations and diffusions. Three bi-directional stress gages were installed to the upper wall to measure the normal and shear stresses of the granular materials along the upper wall. Thus, the effective viscosities of the wet granular material systems could be evaluated. The dimensionless normal and shear stresses, and the effective viscosity in the wet sheared granular flow were found to decrease with the increase of the viscosity of the added silicone oil. The influence of the viscosity of added fluid on these transport properties of wet granular systems will be discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33749476653	Influence of internal friction on transport properties in sheared granular flows	The effect has been studied of the Internal friction coefficient of particles on transport properties of sheared granular flows. Experiments were performed in shear cell devices under four different internal friction coefficients of the particles and five different solid fractions. The motions of the granular materials were recorded by a high-speed camera. By using image processing technology and the particle tracking method, we measured and analyzed the distributions of the average velocity, fluctuation velocity, and particle self-diffusion coefficient. Three bi-directional stress gages were used to measure the normal and shear stresses along the upper boundary. According to the experimental results, the stresses and the self-diffusion coefficients of the particles were inverse proportional to the internal friction coefficients. In the same conditions, the normal stresses were apparently higher than the shear stresses. The fluctuation and the selfdiffusion coefficients in the streamwise direction were obviously higher than those in the transverse direction. The normal and shear stresses were found to increase with the solid fraction, but the diffusion coefficients were greater in a more dilute flow system. In addition, the deviations of self-diffusion coefficients in the low solid fraction condition were much greater than those in the high solid fraction condition. © 2006 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

34547623574	Validation tests of DEM simulation for the particle collisions	Discrete Element Method (DEM) has been widely used to simulate the behavior of a granular system. This paper proposes a series of systematic validation tests for the DEM program, which simulates the granular motion in a vibrated bed. First, the simple collision systems, including five tests of collisions between particles or between particles and boundaries, are employed to validate the DEM simulation. The simulation results obey the conservation law of momentum for each collision and the conservation law of kinetic energy in a conservative force field. In addition, the errors in the conservation of kinetic energy are investigated with various maximum relative impact velocities. The results demonstrate that the errors in each test are in the same order. Consequently, this paper provides useful methods of validation tests for other similar simulations of a granular system.

Different masses of granular materials were put in an annular shear device with a stationary upper wall and a constantly rotated lower wall. The image processing technique and the particle tracking method were employed to measure average particle velocities and fluctuating velocities in the streamwise and transverse directions. The granular flows consisted of a low shear rate region with higher and more uniform velocities in the lower test section, and a high shear rate region in the upper part. The velocities decreased with the height, while the fluctuations, granular temperature and shear rate increased with the height. The velocity fluctuations were anisotropic and were greater in the streamwise direction. The slip velocity and the low shear layer thickness were greater for the case with greater total granular mass.

0033622694	Effective thermal conductivities of a single species and a binary mixture of granular materials	The effective thermal conductivity is developed by employing the dense-gas kinetic theory. The free path used in the theory varies with the particle velocity.

For the very small Biot-Fourier numbers, the conductivities are found to increase with the particle diameters and the square root of granular temperatures. For the limit of very large Biot-Fourier numbers, the effective thermal conductivity is found to be linearly proportional to the granular temperature. The effective thermal conductivities for the binary mixtures are also derived. The influences of the species concentration, the total solid fraction and the Biot-Fourier number on the thermal conductivity are investigated. Increasing the concentration of the smaller particles or reducing the size of the smaller species can increase the thermal conduction in the binary mixture system.

When the louver angle is steep, the velocity profile of filter granules is close to plug flow. When the louver section is shallow, the quasi-stagnant zones exist along the louver walls.

From the measured velocities, the fluctuations, granular temperatures and shear rates could be determined. The self-diffusion coefficients were determined from the history of particles' diffusive displacements. The periodic cell concept was used for long-time tracking purpose. Because of the gravitation force, the flows consist of both a solid-like region with higher and more uniform velocities in the lower test section and a fluid-like region in the upper part. The velocity fluctuations and self-diffusions were anisotropic with greatest components in the streamwise direction. The flow rheology was very sensitive to the mean solid fraction of the granular flow. The dependence of the diffusion coefficients on the velocity fluctuations and the shear rate were discussed.

The first series of experiments were mixing experiments, and the developments of mixing layer thicknesses were measured. The second series of experiments had the same experimental conditions as the first series but used different combinations of colored particles. In the second series of experiments, the motions of granular materials were recorded by a high-speed camera. Using the image processing technology and particle tracking method, the positions and velocities of particles were measured. The self-diffusion coefficient could be found from the history of the particle displacements. The measured mixing layer thicknesses are compared with the calculations from a simple diffusion equation using the data of apparent self-diffusion coefficients obtained from the current measurements. The comparisons show good agreements, demonstrating that the mixing process of granular materials occur through the diffusion mechanism in this cohesive sheared flow. In addition, the apparent self-diffusion coefficient decreases with the increasing liquid volume, indicating that cohesive effect between particles reduces granular mixing. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

34250009566	Rapid flow of dry granular materials down inclined chutes impinging on rigid walls	We performed laboratory experiments of dry granular chute flows impinging an obstructing wall. The chute consists of a 10 cm wide rectangular channel, inclined by 50° relative to the horizontal, which, 2 m downslope abruptly changes into a horizontal channel of the same width. 15l of quartz chips are released through a gate with the same width as the chute and a gap of 6cm height, respectively. Experiments are conducted for two positions of the obstructing wall, (i) 2 m below the exit gate and perpendicular to the inclined chute, and (ii) 0.63 m into the horizontal runout and then vertically oriented. Granular material is continuously released by opening the shutter of the silo. The material then moves rapidly down the chute and impinges on the obstructing wall. This leads to a sudden change in the flow regime from a fast moving supercritical thin layer to a stagnant thick heap with variable thickness and a surface dictated by the angle of repose typical for the material. We conducted particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments by recording the moving material from the side with charge coupled devices (CCD) cameras. The experiment was also video recorded. From the CCD data velocities were also deduced using the PIV technique. In order to compare the results here we describe the experiments for the same material and the same gap width of the silo gate but for the two positions of the obstructing wall. Analysis of the shock front formation and propagation upslope, evolution of the height of the supercritical flow, impact velocity and momentum are presented and discussed in detail. Computed and derived shock front heights match well. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

80052325189	The effect of interstitial fluid viscosity on particle segregation in a slurry rotating drum	Although the segregation of dry granular surface flow has been widely studied, cases where the air is completely replaced by a liquid still remain unexplored. In this study, we report on experiments performed to investigate the phenomena of particle segregation and flowing behavior in a rotating drum with liquids of different viscosities and different filling degrees. The experimental results indicate that the viscosity of the interstitial fluid has a significant effect on the granular flow in the slurry granular flow. The segregation index and angle of repose are shown to decrease with increased liquid viscosity. When the liquid viscosity is the same, the increase in filling degree causes the segregation index to increase, while the net rate of mixing seems to decrease. A new dimensionless flow variable is used to distinguish the flow regimes. We find that the flow regime changes from rolling regime to cascading regime when the dimensionless flow variable is below a critical value. Furthermore, the change of segregation index occurs during the transition of the granular flow regime. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

The motions of the granular materials were recorded by a high-speed camera. Image processing technology and a particle tracking method were employed to measure the convection strength, convection size, and granular temperature. The results show that the initial bed height, dimensionless vibrating acceleration, and vibrating frequency have significant influence on the convection mechanism. An interesting finding that occurs with increasing the bed height is the existence of two peaks and one low convection strength value which occurs due to the growth of the solid-like region. We also find that the two peak and one low values become greater when higher dimensionless vibrating acceleration is applied to the granular bed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84861884026	Dynamic properties of immersed granular matter in different flow regimes in a rotating drum	Using particle tracking velocimetry, we study the dynamic properties and flowing behavior of immersed granular matter in a rotating drum. In this study, the interstitial fluid is water or a water-glycerol mixture. The filling degree of the particles, the rotation speed, and the viscosity of the interstitial fluid are the three experimental control parameters. The results show that both the granular dynamic properties and flowing behavior are strongly affected by the operational parameters. At lower rotation speed or liquid viscosity, the distance between the centroid of all particles and the center of the tank is the same as the initial configuration, but the distance decreases rapidly when the liquid viscosity is above a critical value. The mean velocity, obtained by averaging the velocities of all particles will decrease with the increase of the liquid viscosity. When the liquid viscosity is above a critical value, the mean velocity will increase, and the granular flow behavior will transform into a suspension regime. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that the liquid viscosity and the flow rate per unit width have a significant influence on the dynamic properties and flow behavior of the immersed granular matter. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84887511885	The effects of particle density and interstitial fluid viscosity on the dynamic properties of granular slurries in a rotating drum	Experiments were performed to measure the dynamic properties of granular matter in a slurry rotating drum. Five different fluid viscosities, including air and four different liquid viscosities with mixtures of water and glycerin, as well as three different particle densities were used in the experiments. In this study, the purpose was to quantify the effects of the particle density and fluid drag force in a granular system.Particle tracking velocimetry was employed to measure the dynamic properties. Both the velocity of particle and granular temperature were obtained by averaging the experimental data. The angle of repose and diffusion coefficient were also calculated. The results show that the granular dynamic properties are strongly affected by the operational parameters. The mean velocity, obtained by averaging the velocities of all particles will decrease with an increase of the fluid viscosity. The average granular temperature will also decrease with increasing fluid viscosity. Moreover, the dimensionless number related to the dynamic properties is also discussed in the present study. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

48849091800	Rapid shear flows of dry granular masses down curved and twisted channels	Depth evolution and final deposits play a crucial role in the description of the dynamics of granular avalanches. This paper presents new and important results on the geometric deformation and measurements of avalanche depositions in laboratory granular flows and their comparisons with theoretical predictions through some benchmark problems for flows down curved and twisted channels merging into a horizontal plane. XY-table and analoglaser sensor are applied to measure geometries of deposited masses in the fanlike open transition and runout zones for different granular materials, different channel lengths, and different channel mouths in the runout zone. The model equations proposed by Pudasaini and Hutter ["Rapid shear flows of dry granular masses down curved and twisted channels," J. Fluid Mech. 495, 193 (2003)] are used for theoretical prediction. We show that geometric parameters such as curvature, twist and local details of the channel play a crucial role in the description of avalanching debris and their deposits in the standstill. Asymmetric depositions and surface contours about the central line of the channel could not be produced and predicted by any other classical theories and available experiments in the literature as done in this paper. Such a role played by the geometrical parameters of the channel over physical parameters for the flow of granular materials down a general channel was not investigated before. It is demonstrated that the numerical simulations of the model equations and experimental observations are generally in good agreement. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

53749093639	Flow of filter granules in moving granular beds with louvers and sublouvers	It is important to develop the technology of high-temperature gas cleanup for some advanced power generation systems based on the gasification or combustion of coal or biomass. The moving granular bed filter has great potential to be developed for the hot gas cleanup. However the existence of stagnant zones in granular moving bed systems with louvered walls cause major technical problems, especially in filtration and adsorption processes. With the existence of stagnant zones, the dust particulates and fly ash coming with flue gas may plug the system and the filtration efficiency decreases remarkably. We propose a new design by placing sublouvers into the convergent channel between louvers to diminish the stagnant zones. This paper presents the results of a study of the flow patterns in a quasi two-dimensional cross-flow moving granular bed with systems of louvers and sublouvers. Silica sands were used as filter granules which were discharged from an upper hopper and circulated to the bed. An image processing system was used to record the granular flow for the investigations in flow patterns of filter granules. The velocity field and velocity distributions of filter granules are also evaluated and discussed. In this study, the design of sublouver-system moving bed has been optimized to almost completely eliminate the stagnant zones. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Scarlett, Growth regime map for liquid-bound granules: further development and experimental validation, Powder Technology 117 (2001) 83-97] over the whole parameter range, for a given material and agglomeration method. Agglomeration behaviour in a high-shear mixer granulator was investigated and categorised using the evolution of granule size distribution (GSD). MCC 102 (Microcrystalline cellulose, Avicel 102) and aqueous PEG 6k (Polyethylene Glycol 6000) were employed as solid and liquid materials. Different operating conditions were applied by changing impeller speeds and L/S (liquid-to-solid) ratios (weight of liquid/weight of solid). 12 representative settings were selected and typical agglomeration behaviours were identified, forming a regime map for the system. The effect of impeller speed was found to depend on the L/S ratio, very little effect being seen at low L/S ratio (L/S = 85/150), but much more effect at higher binder ratios. In general, the effect of L/S ratio is of paramount importance in these systems and usually determines the growth behaviour. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

56749156114	Mixing of cohesive particles in a shear cell	This paper discusses a series of experiments performed in a shear cell device with six different amounts of silicone oils and using 2-mm glass spheres as the granular materials. The motion of granular materials is recorded by a high-speed camera. Using the image processing technology and particle tracking method, the positions and velocities of particles are measured. The self-diffusion coefficient can be found from the history of the particle displacements. Mixing experiments are performed, and the developments of mixing layer thicknesses are measured. The measured mixing layer thicknesses are compared with the calculations from a simple diffusion equation using the data of apparent self-diffusion coefficients obtained from the current measurements. The comparisons show good agreements, demonstrating that the mixing process of granular materials occur through the diffusion mechanism in this cohesive sheared flow. In addition, the apparent self-diffusion coefficient decreases with the increasing liquid volume, indicating that cohesive forces between particles reduce granular mixing.

56749182391	Dynamic mechanisms of a vibration bed under weakly excitation	The phenomena of granular motion in a weakly vibrating bed were different from that in a strong vibrated bed. Many studies have shown that a granular bed can be fluidized by external excitation and several different kinds of complicated phenomena under external vibrations can be generated, such as heaping, pattern formation, convection, fluidization, size segregation, surface wave, and arching. However, most previous works focused on the vibrated system under the strong vibration, and very few studies investigated the dynamic mechanisms of particles under a weakly excited system. The paper intends to investigate the dynamic mechanisms of particulates of a weakly vibration bed. The heights of solid-like layer and depths of liquid-like layer were measured under different vibrated conditions. Three different motion regimes, such as complete solid-like region, liquid-like region, and fully liquid-like region, were found from the phase diagram of granular motion states in a weakly vibrating bed.

62549134869	Cake formation and growth in cake filtration	In this study we develop an experimental method to help understand the formation and growth of dust cakes. An on-line pressure-displacement measurement system is developed to measure the thickness of the dust cakes. A higher filtration superficial velocity resulted in a higher degree of compaction in the dust cakes and thus a higher specific cake resistance, hence a better collection efficiency could be achieved. The empirical equations for cake solidosity and specific cake resistance as a function of the filtration superficial velocity are derived. We find that the cake filter is influenced by the cake thickness and the filtration superficial velocity. The results of this study can be applied to granular bed filters for the removal of dust particulates in advanced coal-fired power systems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The existence of stagnant zone is an important problem to be solved since the dust particulates and fly ash coming with flue gas may plug the system and the filtration efficiency decreases remarkably. We proposed the idea of placing sublouvers into the convergent channel between louvers. The idea has been demonstrated the possibility to diminish the stagnant zones. This paper tries to study the influence of vertical shift of the sublouver position on the flow pattern. A quasi two-dimensional cross-flow moving granular bed, with systems of louvers and sublouvers, was used as the experimental facility. We used the silica sands as filter granules discharged from an upper hopper and circulated to the bed. An image processing system was used to record the granular flow for analyzing the flow patterns and velocity fields of filter granules. In this study, the optimum design of louver-sublouver moving bed has been demonstrated to almost completely eliminate the stagnant zones. Besides the quasi two-dimensional cross-flow moving bed tests, we also tested a three-dimensional moving bed using the optimum design of louver-sublouver. The results were also very satisfactory. © 2008 The Society of Powder Technology Japan. Published by Elsevier BV and The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

67349131857	Influence of interstitial fluid viscosity on transport phenomenon in sheared granular materials	We report experimental measurements of transport properties on sheared granular materials with different interstitial fluids to study the granular flow behaviors. Four kinds of interstitial fluids are used in the experiments. The ensemble velocities, fluctuation velocities, granular temperature and self-diffusion coefficients are successfully measured by PTV method. The results indicate that the interstitial fluid plays an important role in determining the transport properties of the granular flow. The particles motions are more random and interactive collisions are more serious in a dry system (interstitial fluid of air). The values of fluctuations and granular temperatures are smaller as the interstitial fluid is more viscous resulting in the larger viscous force. The thickness of shear band is about three to eight particle diameters and increases with the decreasing interstitial fluid viscosity. The self-diffusion coefficient of granular materials is also discussed in this study. Both the self-diffusion coefficients and the granular temperature increase with the increasing shear rate. The average streamwise self-diffusion coefficient and granular temperature increase with the increase in Stokes number and Bagnold number. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

69249247050	The flow regime during the crystallization state and convection state on a vibrating granular bed	It is possible to utilize the large particle distribution on the free surface and inside a vibrating granular bed to understand the segregation phenomenon and the granular motion states in the vibrating bed. In this study we strive to analyze different flow regimes in a binary mixture in a granular vibrating bed. The granular temperature of large particles on the surface of the vibrating bed can be used to define the motion states, the crystallization state or the convection state. When the dimensionless vibration amplitude increases from 0.25 to 1.0, the granular motion transforms from the slowly stabilizing crystallization state to the strong convection state. When the amplitude of the dimensionless vibration increases from 1.25 to 2.5, the granular motion transforms from the fast stabilizing crystallization state to the unstable crystallization state. The percentage of large particles occupying the free surface and the concentration of these large particles are analyzed to understand the motion states. © 2009 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

70349392297	Filtration of dust particulates with a moving granular bed filter	The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of a moving granular bed filter designed for cold test to filter coal particulates. A series of experiments were carried out at room temperature to demonstrate the collection efficiency of this method of filtration technology (i.e., the moving granular bed filter) at different filtration superficial velocities and mass flow rates of filter granules but with a fixed inlet dust concentration. The dynamic characteristics of the filter system were evaluated by measuring variations in the outlet concentration and size distribution of dust particulates. The collection mechanisms of the filter granules in the moving granular bed filter were also studied. Experimental results showed that the collection efficiency could be enhanced by using a filtration superficial velocity of 30 cm/s and mass flow rate of 450 g/min. The results of this study indicate this type of method could be useful for application in different cross-flow filter systems for gas cleanup. The focus in the current study is essentially the development of a moving granular bed filter that could be applied in a high-temperature environment.

70449642368	Experimental analysis of dynamic properties in wet sheared granular matter	We performed experiments to measure the dynamic properties of wet granular matter in a shear cell device. The purpose was to quantify the effect of the liquid bridge force on granular systems. The motions of the granular materials were recorded by a high-speed camera. Image processing technology and particle tracking method were employed to measure the velocities, fluctuation velocities and granular temperatures in the streamwise and the transverse directions. The results show that adding small amounts of liquid with different viscosities, and changing the wall velocity, both have significant influences on the dynamic properties of wet granular matter due to the formation and rupturing of liquid bridges. The energy dissipation due to the formation and rupturing of the liquid bridges increases with the increase of wall velocity and the increase of liquid viscosity. The effect of the liquid bridge force on the dynamic properties is not only dependent on the liquid viscosity but also on the kinetic energy of the granular system. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Three kinds of asymmetrical hopper ((i)LA=15°, RA=40°; (ii) LA=15°, RA=30°; (iii) LA=15°, RA=20°) are used to contain 100 disks of 1cm diameter, respectively. LA is the angle between the left boundary of hopper and vertical line, and RA is the angle between the right boundary of hopper and vertical line. The results of computer simulation show that the hopper boundary affect the flowing behavior of disks. The research work reported here and [10] show that the disks close to the right hopper boundary move slowly and develop the quasi-stagnant zone.

Employing image processing technology and a particle tracking method, the local displacements and velocities of particles were measured. The self-diffusion coefficients were determined from the history of particles' diffusive displacements. Discrete element method simulation was performed to calculate the particles' self-diffusive displacements. The simulation results were compared to the experimental tests. The flow behavior of convection rolls in a vibrated bed occurred by the particles' self-diffusion induced by the energy input from vertical external vibration. The velocity fluctuations, granular temperature and self-diffusions were anisotropic with greatest components in the vertical direction. The dependence of the diffusion coefficients on the dimensionless acceleration amplitude, vibration amplitude, vibration frequency, velocity fluctuations, granular temperature, vibration velocity, restitution coefficient and solid fraction are discussed.

71549137440	Segregation to mixing in wet granular matter under vibration	This study intends to investigate the influences of the content and viscosity of small amount of silicone oils added to a binary-mixture on the segregation phenomena in a vibrated shaker. The silicon oils with five different viscosities and six different liquid contents are utilized in this study. The dimensionless average height of the larger particles was measured so as to characterize the so-called "Brazil nut effects." The experimental results indicate that the dimensionless average height of the larger particles decreases with the increase of the viscosity and liquid content of the added silicone oil. The results show that not only liquid content but also liquid viscosity plays a significant role on the final segregation state. We also find that the liquid bridge force does not have significant effect on the final segregation state if adding very low-viscosity liquid even if the liquid content is increased. Finally, we find that the size segregation could be controlled by the addition of different liquid content and viscosities. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77649183264	The influence of gravity on dynamic properties in sheared granular flows	The influences of gravity on the granular flow behavior and dynamic properties were experimentally studied in a vertical shear cell device where the shear dilation direction of granular materials was perpendicular to the gravity direction. The particle motions were recorded by a high-speed camera from three different observational views. By using image processing technology and the particle tracking method, the average velocities and granular temperatures in the streamwise and the transverse directions were successfully measured and analyzed. The results show that the anisotropic motions exist in sheared granular flows. The dynamic properties in the streamwise direction are larger than those in the transverse direction. Due to the gravity effect and bulk flow of granular materials, the local packing structure is not homogenous in the vertical shear cell. By comparing the three different observational views in the vertical shear cell, we find that the spatial average velocity and self-diffusion coefficient are the greatest but the shear rate and granular temperature are the smallest when the particles are co-flowing with gravity causing the most dilute packing structure due to the gravity effect. Similar experiments were also performed in a horizontal shear cell where the shear dilation direction of granular materials was against the gravity direction. The dynamic properties are smaller in the horizontal shear cell than those in the vertical shear cell. It is because the horizontal shear cell has the smaller shear rate with the shear dilation direction against the gravity direction. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77649190194	The study of granular agglomeration mechanism	The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the properties of different binders on the granular agglomeration mechanism for the fabrication of pharmaceuticals. The raw materials included calcium carbonate powders with an average particle size of 32-75 μm and four different grades (4000, 6000, 8000 and 10,000) of polyethylene glycol (PEG) used as binders. The raw material was mixed with the binder in a high shear mixer. The surface structure of the granules was analyzed by low vacuum scanning electron microscope (LV-SEM) examination. Three major agglomeration mechanisms are discussed in this study: nucleation, consolidation and coalescence. The results showed that the agglomeration growth rate increased with increasing binder viscosity during the nucleation stage, but the exact opposite phenomenon occurred in the consolidation stage. Observation of the granular surfaces showed the surfaces to be full of fine powder in the nucleation stage, but PEG crystals appeared on the surface in the consolidation stage. During the coalescence stage, the granules grew quickly due to collisions and the surface structures of the granules became full of binders, as can be seen from the LV-SEM photographs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77953617868	An improved PTV technique to evaluate the velocity field of non-spherical particles	In recent years, Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) has been extensively used to measure the translational velocity field of granular assemblies in applications such as vibrated beds, rotating drums and Couette shear cells. However, this technique has not yet been shown to be able to determine the velocity field of non-spherical particles. The aim of this paper is to develop an improved PTV technique to determine translational and rotational velocities for non-spherical particles. To prove the feasibility of this new PTV technique, it was employed to investigate the convection behaviour of non-spherical particles in a vibrated bed. In the demonstration example, paired POM particles made by gluing two single POM beads were studied. The test example was a single layer quasi-2D model. The transport properties of the paired POM particles in a vibrated bed, such as local average velocities, local fluctuation velocities, granular temperatures, fluctuation velocity distributions, self-diffusion coefficients and dimensionless convection flow rates, were evaluated from the experimental results and discussed. The developed improved PTV technique is shown to have the ability to measure more accurately the velocity field of non-spherical particulate systems. The study has demonstrated the convection phenomenon of non-spherical particles in a vibrated bed and has shown that particle rotation is significant in the vibrated granular bed. In such a granular system with convection phenomenon, the average rotational kinetic energy constitutes approximately 5.4% of the average kinetic energy and in some local regions the rotational granular temperature amounts to over 17% of the total granular temperature. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77953332726	The discharge of fine silica sands in a silo	Numerous industrial processing operations involve the handling and transport of powders, bulk solids, and granules. Silos and bins are widely used to store granular solids, and it is imperative to be able to control the flow rate during the discharge of these solids from such equipment. It is important to study the gravity discharge of fine particles because of its many industrial applications. Most theoretical and empirical equations for the calculation of the discharge rate of fine powders tend to overestimate when particles smaller than about 500 μm are used. An air stream flows through a silo from an outlet on the top which may cause the discharge process to become unstable and erratic. We used open-top and closed-top silos with different sizes of outlet openings for an experimental study of the discharge behaviors of different-sized silica sands. The impact force, average discharge rate and pressure drop were measured and are discussed. Darcy's law was used to predict the pressure drop and this calculation is compared with the experimental results. In addition, we observed that a bubble phenomenon can occur in very fine-powder silo systems. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

77955147721	Granular dynamics of a slurry in a rotating drum	We study the effects of interstitial fluid viscosity on the rates of dynamical processes in a thin rotating drum half-filled with monodisperse glass beads. The rotating speed is fixed at the rolling regime such that a continuously flowing layer of beads persists at the free surface. While the characteristic speed of a bead in the flowing layer decreases with the fluid viscosity μ, the mixing rate of the beads is found to increase with μ. These findings are consistent to a simple model related to the thickness of the flowing layer. In addition, our results indicate a possible transition from the inertial limit regime to the viscous limit regime (reported previously by S. Courrech du Pont [Phys. Rev.

Back pulses of cleaning gas expand dust cake on the condition, that their power is just adequate to properties of cake, such as angle of internal friction and cohesion.

77957017866	Density segregation in a vertically vibrated granular bed	The dominant mechanism affecting the flow behavior of granular materials is the random motions of particles that results from the interactive collisions between particles. The velocity fluctuations induce the segregation in granular flows. The different densities of granular materials with different filling layers and packing ratios were used to investigate the segregation mechanisms in a vibrated granular bed in this study. The image processing techniques were employed to track the motion of granular materials. The fluctuating velocities of granular materials were measured under segregation in a vibrated granular bed. The segregation phenomena depend on the packing ratio and the filling layer of the stainless steel-glass mixtures. At the fewer filling layers, the heavier stainless steel beads migrate to the bottom regions with the lower granular temperature, so the granular temperature plays a significant role on density segregation. For the higher filling layers, the bulk convection motion is the main mechanism affecting segregation, so the heavier beads clump to the convection center and the clump size enlarges with the increasing packing ratio of heavier beads due to the bulk convection motion. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A series of experiments were carried out at room temperature to demonstrate the screening efficiency of this method under different operating conditions. The dynamic model and velocity analysis of undersized particulates in the trommel body are also discussed.

78649624518	Investigation of the gas inlet velocity distribution in a fixed granular bed filter	Granular bed filter (GBF) technology can be applied for high-temperature gas cleanup in integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) and pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC) advanced coal-fired power plants. The design of the gas inlet component of the granular bed filter is important to achieve a uniform gas distribution and higher usage rate of the filter media. Previous studies show that the gas velocity at the inlet is not uniformly distributed. This non-uniformity may lead to a lower usage rate of the filter media. In this study a baffle device is introduced to the inlet system in order to achieve a more uniform gas velocity distribution. A more uniform gas inlet distribution can be obtained by adjustment of the lengths and angles of the baffles. The gas velocities along the inlet and filtration surfaces are measured using a pitot tube. The uniformity of the gas velocity distribution can be characterized by looking at the distributions of the standard deviation of the gas velocity and the differences in the mean velocities between the two filtration surfaces. © 2010 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

Three bi-directional stress gages were installed to measure the normal and shear stresses along the upper wall.

Besides the fundamental observations in a shear device, this paper will briefly describe the technology of "moving granular bed filter" developed at National Central University.

79951677871	The effect of vibrating conditions on the electrostatic charge in a vertical vibrating granular bed	In this study, we carried out experiments to measure the electrostatic charge of a granular matter in a vertical shaker device. The purpose was to quantify the effect of the vibrating conditions on electrostatic charging in the granular matter. In each experimental run, 3. mm glass beads were first discharged to remove any residual charge prior to subsequently studying their electrostatic charging. The accumulative electrostatic charges of the granular materials were measured using a Faraday cage. The findings show that the vibrating conditions play an important role in the saturated electrostatic charge and time constant. The electrostatic charges of granular materials are mainly generated by the contact potential difference mechanism in the vibrating granular system. The results show that the saturated accumulation charge increases as the dimensionless vibrating acceleration increases, and decreases with increasing vibrating frequency. The time constant is small when a higher vibrating frequency is applied in the vibrating granular system. Finally, we demonstrate that the saturated accumulation charge increases linearly with the increase of the dimensionless vibrating velocity regardless of the vibrating frequency. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

0035861605	The simulation of powders with liquid bridges in a 2D vibrated bed	The discrete element method is employed to study the convection cells of wet glass beads in a two-dimensional vibrated granular bed. Three types of viscous fluids with different values of viscosity are used in this work. A simplified model of dynamic bridge strength based on the superposition of lubrication and circular approximation is used in the simulation model. The flowfields of wet particles, the depth profiles of solid fraction and granular temperature as functions of the altitude are investigated. The mechanism of energy dissipation due to friction, inelasticity, viscous resistance and liquid bridge bond rupture are also discussed in detail. For wet granular materials, the liquid bridge force due to surface tension and viscosity interacts with frictional force mutually to determine the strength of the convection flow rate. The energy dissipation is mainly associated with the viscous force, the interparticle friction and the inelasticity of collision, rather than with the capillary force of liquid bridge. The energy dissipation increases monotonously with the increase of the dimensionless interstitial liquid volume, and the distributions of the energy dissipation are strongly influenced by the properties of viscous fluids. Plotting the energy dissipation against the dimensionless liquid volume in a logarithmic scale, a power law relation is shown to exist between the energy dissipation and the dimensionless liquid volume. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0035864102	Velocities in moving granular bed filters	This paper concerns the velocity fields of three symmetric louver-walled moving-bed systems. The louver angles were 10°, 20° and 50° in the three experimental tests. The particle-tracking method and image-processing technology were employed to measure the granule velocity fields in the louver sections. The horizontal and vertical velocity distributions extracted from the velocity fields at five levels of the louver section were plotted and discussed. The velocity profiles of filter granules are influenced by the louver geometry. In the steeper louver-angle system, the velocity profile of filter granules is similar to plug flow. The stagnant zones exist along the louver walls in the filter system with shallow louver sections.

0036105226	Flow patterns and stresses on the wall in a moving granular bed with eccentric discharge	The flow patterns and stresses on the wall in a moving granular bed with eccentric discharge were investigated experimentally. The flow pattern histories of granular solids in the moving bed were recorded using a digital camcorder. The image processing system included a frame grabber. A new pressure gauge for simultaneously measuring the normal and shear stresses of granular solids was used. During filling the granular material, the variations in stresses acting on the side walls with time in a granular bed were observed. Also, the dynamic wall stresses were obtained during the eccentric discharge. Employing the results obtained by stress measurements and image processing, the pressure pulsation phenomena in a moving granular bed may be understood further.

0035935220	The simulation and experimental study of granular materials discharged from a silo with the placement of inserts	The simulation method of DEM and experimental method are used to investigate the flow pattern of the filling and discharging process for two-dimensional plane silos. Two kinds of inserts (conical insert and BINSERT®) are used in the silo to change the flow fields of the silo. The placement of inserts improves the flow behaviors of funnel flow type to mass flow type during discharging. The wall normal stresses are influenced by the change of the flow type. The effects of using differently shaped inserts on the flow pattern and wall stress are analyzed in this study. The controlling parameters include the silo half-angle, the orifice width, the shape of the insert and the properties of the granular materials. The simulation and experimental results are in good agreement. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

0036470088	Stresses and transport phenomena in sheared granular flows with different wall conditions	Experiments were performed in a shear cell device with four different wall conditions. The glass spheres with a mean diameter of 3 mm were used as granular materials. Three bidirectional stress gauges were installed to measure the normal and shear stresses along the upper wall. The motions of the granular materials were recorded by a high-speed camera. The image processing technology and particle tracking method were employed to measure the average and fluctuation velocities in the streamwise and the transverse directions. By tracking the movements of particles continually, the variation in the mean-square diffusive displacements with time was plotted and the self-diffusion coefficient was determined. The self-diffusion coefficients in the streamwise direction were much higher than those in the transverse direction. The self-diffusion coefficients were increased with the increase of the velocity fluctuations, the shear rates, and the stresses. The influences of the wall conditions (wall frictional coefficients) on these properties are discussed in the paper. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.

0036666589	Convection cells and segregation in a vibrated granular bed	Granular materials may be circulated in a container with two symmetric convection cells under external vertical vibration conditions. Effects of the container geometry on the convection strength and segregation process are studied experimentally. First, the wall tilted outward angles are changed to observe the direction of the convection roll and convection strength. The strength of the normal convection rolls decreases by increasing the wall angles of the container from 0° (vertical walls). The convection rolls become reversed when the wall tilted outward angles are greater than a transition angle. The wall roughness and vibration velocity amplitude are also changed to investigate their influences on the convection cell strength. The segregation of a larger disk induced by the convection cells of smaller disks shows that the normal convection rolls induce the upward motion of the larger disk, and the reverse convection rolls result in the downward motion of the larger disk. The separation velocity increases linearly with the convection flow rate.

79957439087	Influence of the interaction between binder and powders on melt agglomeration behavior in a high-shear mixer	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the different surface properties of powders on granular agglomeration in a high-shear mixer. Polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) was used as the melting binder. Three different powders, with mean granule sizes of 75-150 μm were used as the raw materials: calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, and sodium carbonate. The wetting properties of the raw materials were measured with a contact angle instrument. The results indicate that the speed at which the droplets sink into the powder bed and the contact angle of binder droplets on the powder surface play important roles in determining the progress of the agglomeration process. Several types of agglomeration were found: a slurry state, heterogeneous nucleation, snowballing, and induction growth behavior. Heterogeneous dispersion leads to induction behavior and subsequent growth, but a homogeneous dispersion leads to little or no nucleation and growth of agglomerate size. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79958159752	The granular mixing in a slurry rotating drum	The mixing dynamics of granular materials immersed in a liquid was experimentally studied in a quasi-2D rotating drum. A DV (SONY DCR-TRV900 NTSC) motion corder analyzer was used to record the motions of granular materials. The effects of interstitial fluid viscosity and filling degree on the mixing index, mixing rate constant, and dynamic repose angle in the rotating drum were investigated and discussed in this paper. The experimental results show that the interstitial fluid viscosity has almost not influence on the final stable mixing index but has significantly effects on the mixing rate constant and dynamic repose angle in slurry granular flows. The results show that the mixing rate and dynamic repose angle increase with increasing the interstitial fluid viscosity. The results also indicate that the filling degree plays an important role in mixing dynamics in slurry granular flows. The mixing rate constant is demonstrated to be decreased with increasing the filling degree. The dynamic repose angle is not altered by the filling degree. Finally, we find that the dynamic repose angle and the mixing rate constant increase slightly at high Stokes number and increase dramatically at low Stokes number with decreasing Stokes number. © 2010 SPIE.

80054707787	Experimental study of the gas flow behavior in the inlet of a granular bed filter	The Moving Granular Bed Filter (MGBF) is an important apparatus being developed for filtration of the hot gas. Our research group demonstrated a good solution to diminish stagnant zones in MGBF during the filtration process. However, there still remain some systematic problems that have to be worked out prior to commercializing a whole facility. The design of the gas inlet component of the granular bed filter is important for achieving a uniform gas distribution and higher usage rate of the filter media. Non-uniformity may lead to a lower usage rate. The new gas inlet component design uses baffle devices in order to achieve a more uniform gas velocity distribution. Fixed bed and moving bed conditions were studied. The uniformity of the gas velocity distribution can be characterized by the standard deviation definitions and the differences in the mean velocities between the two filtration surfaces. The baffle lengths and angles affected the uniformity of gas velocity in inlet and filtration surfaces. The optimal experimental parameters were found by using different baffle lengths, angles and mass flow rate of filter media. The uniform gas velocity distributions were obtained by a series experiments. Furthermore, the results give important information about IGCC system that will be helpful for designing better models of moving granular bed filters in the future. © 2010 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

80054859219	Experimental analysis of the dynamic properties of wet granular matter in a rotating drum	We performed experiments to measure the dynamic properties of wet granular matter in a rotating drum device. Four different amounts of liquid and rotation speeds were used in the experiments. The purpose was to quantify the effect of the cohesive force in the granular system. The results show that when only very small amounts of liquid were added, no liquid bridges formed. This is because the liquid was first trapped on the surface of the particles due to the particle roughness. When the volume fraction of the fluid became larger, liquid bridges formed on almost every particle. The results showed that the addition of liquid contents, and changing the rotation speed, both had a significant effect on the dynamic properties of granular matter. This was due to the hysteretic formation and rupturing of liquid bridges and the introduction of inertial force to the device. After the liquid bridges formed between all particles the average energy dissipation due to the hysteretic formation and rupturing of the liquid bridges increased with an increase in the liquid content. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

82955212811	Indirect measurements of streamwise solid fraction variations of granular flows accelerating down a smooth rectangular chute	In this study, we detail a method for estimating the flux-averaged solid fraction of a steady granular flows moving down an inclined rectangular chute using velocity measurements from along the perimeter cross section, combined with knowledge of the mass flow rate through the cross section. The chute is 5 cm wide and 150 cm long with an adjustable inclination angle. Four inclination angles, from 27° to 36° at 3° intervals, are tested. This angle range overlaps the internal friction angle of the glass beads, which are 4 mm nominal in diameter. Two slender mirrors are installed at the top and the bottom of the transparent chute to reflect images of the flow down the chute of the two surfaces. This allows photographic recording of the flow with a PIV imaging system and measurement of the flow depth. The mass flow rate can be calibrated simultaneously by collecting the accumulated mass at the chute exit. A linear interpolation scheme is proposed to interpolate the volume flow rate in each section of the chute. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the relative standard deviation of this scheme is about ±6%, i.e., the resultant solid volume fraction is only moderately dependent on the interpolation scheme for the tested cases. This is further confirmed by a direct intercepting method. Compared to the sophisticated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or the radioactive positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) methods, the present method is verified as a cost-effective and nonhazardous alternative for ordinary laboratories. Two distinct groups of streamwise dependence of the solid fractions are found. They are separated by the inclination angle of the chute and agreed with the internal friction angle. In the experiments using the two smaller inclination angles, the solid fraction ratios are found to be linear functions of the streamwise distance, while for the two larger inclination angles, the ratios have a nonlinear concave shape. All decrease with growing downstream distance. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84856114802	Influence of the initial volume fill ratio of the granulator on melt agglomeration behavior in a high-shear mixer	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different initial volume fill ratios of the granulator on granular agglomeration in a high-shear mixer. Calcium carbonate powders, with mean granule sizes of 75-150 μm were used as the raw material. Polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) was used as the melting binder. The initial liquid to solid weight ratio was fixed at 0.15. Four different initial granulator fill ratios were used 11%, 14.7%, 18.4% and 22%. The results showed that the granules that formed during the nucleation stage were a little larger when the initial fill ratio was lower than higher. In the rapid-growth stage, the agglomeration growth rate increased as the initial fill ratio increased. The range in granule size at the end of agglomeration also increased as initial fill ratio increased. SEM images of the surface structure of the granules during the nucleation and final stages are shown. © 2011 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

84860520691	The discharge of fine silica sand in a silo under different ambient air pressures	Silos are widely used for the industrial scale handling and transportation of powdered and granular materials. The process of discharging powder in a silo involves the flow of both solid particles and an interstitial fluid, usually air. In this study, we experimentally investigate the effects of particle size and ambient pressure on the discharge process in open- and closed-top silos. The discharge rate, pressure drop, and pressure recovery rate are measured and discussed. The results show that the particle size, the diameter of the orifice, and the ambient pressure significantly influence the process of discharge. The effect of air flow is stronger on fine-powdered flow in a closed-top silo. The results indicate that the effects of air flow could be reduced by lowering the ambient pressure. In addition, a normalized critical pressure can be defined beyond which the discharge rate increases dramatically. With reduced ambient pressure, this normalized critical pressure decreases with increasing particle size. Finally, the experimental results are compared with results calculated using the Beverloo equation and Darcy's law. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

84862221939	Filtration of dust particulates using a new filter system with louvers and sublouvers	Coal is a very important fuel since the supply of oil is quite limited, whereas coal is much more plentiful. The pressurized fluidized bed combustion (PFBC) and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems are considered the best for advanced coal-fired power plants. However, the high temperature syngas produced by these systems contains many dust particulates which need to be filtered before entering the gas turbine. The moving granular bed is an important apparatus for the filtration of the hot gas and is currently under development. The goal of this study is to evaluate the performance of a moving granular bed filter designed to filter out coal particulates. We investigate the flow patterns of the filter granules, the collection efficiency, and the pressure drop under different filtration superficial velocities, mass flow rates of filter granules, rotational speeds of the trommel screen system, but with a fixed inlet dust concentration. All filtration system experiments were performed at room temperature. The results showed that using a filtration superficial velocity of 18.01 m/min, mass flow rate of filter granules of 0.46 kg/min, and rotational speed of 63 rpm, the overall porosity of the filter granules decreased and the filter resistance and the collection efficiency increased, with an increase in the amount of smaller-sized filter granules in the bed. The test results apply to moving granular bed filters or other filtration systems functioning in high-temperature environments and are expected to serve as the basis for future research. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863171580	Effects of matter properties on particulate segregation in a vibrating granular bed	A mixture system containing particles of different properties always tends to segregation, and such particle properties include differences in particle size, in density, in shape, and in particle resilience. This paper intends to investigate the effect of size ratios of particles on segregation of dry particulate mixtures in a vibration bed. The effect of difference in particle density is also studied in the research. The rise time of a larger disk placed in the background of smaller beads in a vibration bed was measured to characterize the segregation. It shows that the rise time of the disk intruder decreases with the increase of the disk intruder diameter. The similar analysis procedure is also employed to investigate segregation of particles with different densities in a vibrating bed. The influence of vibration conditions on segregation in a vibrating bed is also discussed in the paper. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group.

84863181127	Segregation of cohesive powders in a vibrated granular bed	The segregation behavior of cohesive powders in a vibrated granular bed is studied by both experiment and simulation. The discrete element method (DEM) incorporating a simplified model of dynamic bridge strength based on the superposition of lubrication and a circular approximation is employed. The rise time of large intruders with various size and density is recorded to calculate the segregation rate. Both experimental and simulation results show that the presence of convection has a strong influence on the rise time of an intruder. As the size ratio remains constant, the segregation rate of cohesive powders is strongly dependent on the intruder density. A non-monotonic dependence of the rise time is found as a function of the density ratio. The rise time of an intruder exhibits a pronounced peak as the density ratio approaches 0.5. The segregation is also strongly influenced by the cohesion force due to liquid bridges. Finally, experimental and simulation results are compared to theoretical predictions. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group.

84863493711	The influence of driving conditions on flow behavior in sheared granular flows	Granular materials may behave like a solid, a liquid, or a gas, depending on the processing conditions. In this study, a two-dimensional annular shear cell was used to investigate the dynamic properties of granular flow when subject to varying driving conditions. The effects of different driving conditions on granular flow were examined by taking images of the motions of granular materials with a high-speed camera. Image processing technology and a particle tracking method were employed to measure velocity, slip velocity, local solid fraction, and granular temperature. The results show a gradual decrease in the velocity profile from the shearing boundary to the stationary wall when only the inner or outer wall rotates. The tangential velocity of granular materials is greater with only a rotating outer wall than with an inner wall rotating singly at the same velocity. The results also show that slip velocity increases in conjunction with wall velocity and decreases if the solid fraction is increased. This study also examined flow behaviors caused by rotating both walls, first in the same direction, and then in opposite directions. The results indicate that granular temperatures in a system with both walls rotating in opposite directions are higher than in a system with walls rotating in the same direction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84865802839	Discrete element modelling and experimental validation for the falling process of dry granular steps	This paper presents an experimental validation of discrete element method (DEM) simulation for falling process of dry granular steps. Three chute slopes were considered in the study. The corresponding physical experiments were carried out in our previous study. The DEM simulations matched well with the experimental results regarding the external flow characteristics such as flow regimes, surface profiles, final deposit angles, velocity profiles at the sidewall, receding upper granular surfaces and flow rates. Subsequently, the DEM simulations were used to explore the internal flow patterns of the granular collapse, including translational velocity profiles and angular velocity profiles inside the granular assembly. According to the DEM simulation results, a mixed velocity profile (an upper convex and lower concave profile) appears in the central part of the chute, whilst the velocity profile follows a sidewall-stabilized heap (SSH) rheology (a concave profile) near the sidewall. The chute inclination facilitates the transformation from the SSH rheology to the mixed velocity profile in a narrow channel. The DEM simulations not only verify the experimental observation but also enhance the understanding of flow patterns induced by the collapse of dry granular steps. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

0037251460	Numerical simulation of self-diffusion and mixing in a vibrated granular bed with the cohesive effect of liquid bridges	The discrete element method (DEM) is employed to study the self-diffusion motions and mixing of cohesive powders with the effect of liquid bridges in a two-dimensional vibrated granular bed. The dynamic liquid bridge forces are considered as the cohesive forces between particles, and three types of viscous liquids with different values of viscosity are used. A simplified model of dynamic bridge strength based on the superposition of lubrication and circular approximation is incorporated in the simulation model. It is found that the granular temperatures and the self-diffusion coefficients of cohesive powders are highly anisotropic with a greater component in the vertical direction. The diffusion coefficients for cohesive powders are larger than those of cohesionless powders and are related to the interstitial liquid volume. The mixing is strongly dependent on the self-diffusivity and is related to the magnitude of interstitial liquid volume. The variations of the self-diffusion coefficients and the mixing rate for three types of interstitial liquids show that the mixing rate constants are proportional to the diffusion coeffcients. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0036905408	Density effect of binary mixtures on the segregation process in a vertical shaker	The segregation process of binary mixture with different density ratios in a granular bed is investigated in this paper. Particles that were 14% (by volume) heavier and 86% lighter put in a container subjected to an external vertical vibration. The velocity fields of both species were measured by an image-processing system. The segregation intensity was determined from the recorded images. It was found that the heavier particles tended to move towards the centers of the two convection cells of the lighter particles. The mixture with the greater density ratio could be segregated more completely. The increase in the vibration acceleration helps the segregation process.

0037462008	The flow patterns and stresses on the wall in a symmetric louvered-wall moving granular filter bed	The flow patterns and stresses on the wall in a symmetric two-dimensional louvered-wall moving granular filter bed were investigated. The static wall stress distributions produced by the granular solids were measured and compared with the theoretical prediction using the differential slice and Runge-Kutta (order four) methods. The variations in the dynamic wall stresses with time in a moving granular filter bed were obtained. In addition, the effect of the louver angle upon the flow patterns and wall stresses was investigated. Four different flow regions were observed in a moving granular filter bed. As the angle of the louver decreases, the quasi-stagnant zone area adjacent to the side wall becomes smaller and the static normal stress acting on the convergent section of the side wall becomes larger. The magnitude of the static normal stress acting on the convergent section is approximately 10 times as large as that acting on the vertical section. When the normal stress measured by pressure gauge installed on the upper stage decreases to zero, the normal wall stress measured by pressure gauge installed on the adjacent lower stage then begins to descend and fluctuate under the static normal wall stress during granular material withdrawal. Employing the results obtained using stress measurements and image processing, the pressure pulsation phenomenon in a symmetric two-dimensional louvered-wall moving granular filter bed may be further understood. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

84866334136	Flow patterns and velocity fields in two-dimensional thin slice panel with flow-corrective insert	An experimental two-dimensional (2-D) thin slice panel for studying flow patterns of fine silica sand was designed and manufactured. As supplier of sand was not known at that time, flow properties of the silica sand were assessed without shear tests. A preliminary design of plane-flow hopper of the experimental 2-D panel was assumed to be close to the mass flow conditions. Sand was circulated in the experimental panel to study the steady state flow. Tests of flow patterns suggested typical funnel-flow patterns with stagnant zones in the hopper and in the vertical part of the panel. Stagnant zones near the bottom of the hopper indicated insufficient width of the hopper outlet. Shear tests for estimation of flow properties of silica sand were carried out additionally and two methods of how to transform the funnel flow of sand to the mass flow were followed up; (a) existing 2-D panel was retrofitted with flow-corrective element, and (b) the width of outlet in existing experimental panel was widen into the size, calculated according to mass flow conditions. Both modifications were proven to be successful and the last-in first-out funnel flow was transformed into first-in first-out mass flow of sand. Velocities of individual tracer particles were measured during mass flow and velocity field was evaluated. Velocity profile of particles in the vicinity of flow-corrective insert was studied in detail. © 2011 The Society of Powder Technology Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V. and The Society of Powder.

84870505999	A two-phase model for dry density-varying granular flows	A granular flow is normally comprised of a mixture of grain-particles (such as sand, gravel or rocks) of different sizes. In this study, dry granular flows are modeled utilizing a set of equations akin to a two-phase mixture system, in which the interstitial fluid is air. The resultant system of equations for a two-dimensional configuration includes two continuity and two momentum balance equations for the two respective constituents. The density variation is described considering the phenomenon of air entrainment/extrusion at the flow surface, where the entrainment rate is assumed to be dependent on the divergent or convergent behavior of the solid constituent. The density difference between the two constituents is extremely large, so, as a consequence scaling analysis reveals that the flow behavior is dominated by the solid species, yielding small relative velocities between the two constituents. A non-oscillatory central (NOC) scheme with total variation diminishing (TVD) limiters is implemented. Three numerical examples are investigated: the first being related to the flow behaviors on a horizontal plane with an unstable initial condition; the second example is devoted to simulating a dam-break problem with respect to different initial conditions; and in the third one investigates the behavior of a finite mass of granular material flowing down an inclined plane. The key features and the capability of the equations to model the behavior are illustrated in these numerical examples. © 2012 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

84870518593	DEM simulation of oblique shocks in gravity-driven granular flows with wedge obstacles	Deflecting wedge obstacles are often built to divert hazardous flows away from residential areas that are in the way of harm. When a rapid avalanche flow is deflected by an obstacle, this usually causes abrupt changes in the flow thickness and velocity and exhibits characteristics like oblique shock waves in the aerodynamic system or oblique hydraulic jumps in the open channel flows. In this study, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is employed to simulate the motion of granular materials impinging on a wedge obstacle in an adjustable inclination chute. We use chutes with four different inclined angles combined with wedge obstacles having different angles to investigate the overall flow behavior. Both the flow velocity and the flow depth are obtained by averaging the numerical simulation data, and then the granular temperature and the shock angle are calculated. The results of the DEM simulation are compared with that of the classical oblique shock theory. We find that there is good agreement between the classical oblique granular shock theoretical calculations and the DEM simulation results.Moreover, themicrodynamic variables related to flow structure such as the packing density and the coordination number are also discussed in the present study. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

The intruder dynamics are determined using a particle-tracking method. The results show that surface roughness has a crucial role in the intruder rise dynamics; a rougher intruder has more difficulty rising in the bed because of higher kinetic energy dissipation. This study determined that penetration length and drag length are reduced and drag is enhanced as intruder surface roughness increases. The exponential decay of the penetration length with vibration frequency is shown. The results also show that at higher dimensionless vibration acceleration and lower vibration frequency the variation in rise time between smooth and rough intruders is negligible. © 2012 American Physical Society.

84873303725	Convection behavior of non-spherical particles in a vibrating bed: Discrete element modeling and experimental validation	This paper proposes a discrete element method (DEM) model to simulate the convection phenomenon of non-spherical particles in a vibrating bed. The corresponding physical experiments were carried out in our previous study. The discrete element simulation results were validated with the experimental results. The non-spherical particles were paired particles, composed of two single beads. The proposed discrete element model adopted Hertz-Mindlin no slip contact force model to model particle collision and multi-sphere method to exactly represent the shape of paired particles. The local damping as well as contact friction and contact damping were incorporated to properly dissipate the system energy of non-spherical granular assemblies. To attain a high level quantitative validation, the important particle properties required for DEM simulation were not simply assumed but measured directly in laboratory tests. The transport properties of paired particles in a vibrated bed, involving local average velocity, local fluctuation velocity, granular temperature, fluctuation velocity distribution and self-diffusion coefficient, were analyzed. The comparison between the DEM results and experimental results was made and discussed in this paper. Both results show the convection phenomena of paired particles in a vibrating bed and the majority of transport properties show good to excellent match, thus giving a quantitative validation for the discrete element simulation of the problem studied here. This proposed discrete element model is shown to provide plausible results and can directly be applicable to realistic industrial problems comprising many non-spherical particles. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84882628211	The dynamics of wet granular matter under a vertical vibration bed	This study investigates the dynamic properties of convection rolls in a 2D wet vibrated granular bed. A particle tracking method with the help of image-processing technology was used to measure the velocity fields, convection flow rate, and the granular temperatures in the wet vibrated granular bed. This study examines the dynamic behaviors of wet granular materials subjected to external vertical vibration. Different liquid contents, viscosities, and surface tensions were added to glass beads forming cohesive granular materials in the vibrated granular bed. This study presents a systematic investigation of the effects of the addition of liquid content, viscosity, and surface tension on dynamic properties of wet particulates. Results show that the convection flow rate and granular temperature decrease monotonically as the added liquid content and liquid viscosity increase. However, the effects of surface tension on the convection flow rate are more significant at the smaller liquid content than that at a higher liquid content. The convection flow rate also decreases in a power decay as the modified Bond number increases. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

0242654611	Measurements of velocity fluctuations of granular materials in a shear cell	This paper studies the flow behavior of granular materials in a shear cell. The average and fluctuating velocities in the streamwise and transverse directions were measured by the image processing technique and particle tracking method. The granular materials were put in a shear cell to simulate the Couette flow with a stationary upper wall. The flows consist of a low shear region with higher and more uniform velocities in the lower test section and of a high shear region in the upper part. The velocities were decreased with the height, and the fluctuations, the granular temperature and the shear rate were increased with the height. The velocity fluctuations were anisotropic and were greater in the streamwise direction. The influences of the lower wall velocity and the mean solid fraction on the flow behavior were investigated in this study.

84891358702	Combined effects of internal friction and bed height on the Brazil-nut problem in a shaker	We experimentally studied the influence of an intruder's friction coefficient and bed-filling height on the Brazil-nut effect in a quasi-2D vertical vibration granular bed. The motion of intruder was successfully measured using a high-speed camera and the rising time of intruder was determined by using a particle tracking method with the help of image processing technology. The results show that an intruder's friction coefficient and filling bed height play significant roles in the rise dynamics. The results also show that the rise time increases when the intruder's friction coefficient increases, which is reduced when the filling bed height decreases. Penetration length and friction drag force were also determined in this study. The penetration length was reduced and the friction drag force was enhanced with the increase of an intruder's friction coefficient and bed height. Additionally, the variation between the rise times of the smooth and rough intruders was not significant with the lower bed-filling heights. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

10944225918	Effect of moisture content on the convection motion of powders in a vibrated bed	The cohesive forces between grains, such as capillary forces, van der Waals forces and electrostatic forces, play significant roles in the motion of particulate solids. This paper intends to investigate the influence of moisture content on the convection motion of wet granular materials in a vibrated bed. The rising velocity of a larger bead in the background of smaller beads in a vibrated bed was used to characterize the strength of the convection cells. It was found that the moisture content in the bed influenced the rising velocity of the larger bead. Under some specific vibration conditions, the rising velocity of the larger bead increased with the addition of a small amount of water. In these cases, the small amount of water produced a lubrication effect which resulted in the enhancement of the convection motion of the bed. With greater amount of water, the rising velocity of the larger bead decreased due to the viscous force and liquid bridge force between the water and beads.

10244256277	Transport property measurements in sheared granular flows	Experiments were performed in a shear cell device under four different solid fractions. The glass spheres with a mean diameter of 3 mm were used as granular materials. The motions of the granular materials were recorded by a high-speed camera. By using image processing technology and a particle tracking method, the average and fluctuation velocities in the streamwise and the transverse directions could be successfully measured and analyzed. Three bi-directional stress gages were used to measure the normal and shear stresses along the upper boundary. The effective viscosity of the granular material flow can be calculated. By tracking the movements of particles continually, the curves of the mean-square diffusive displacements versus time were plotted and were used to determine the self-diffusion coefficients from the slopes of the curves. The fluctuations and the self-diffusion coefficients in the streamwise direction were much higher than those in the transverse direction. The fluctuations were found to increase with the solid fraction, but the diffusion coefficients were greater in a more dilute flow system. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1242338171	Dynamic behaviors of powders in a vibrating bed	The transport properties of convection rolls in a two-dimensional vibrating granular bed are investigated in this paper. The image processing technology and particle tracking method were employed to measure the fluctuation velocities and the self-diffusion coefficients. The fluctuation velocities, granular temperatures, and self-diffusion coefficients were anisotropic with the greater components in the vertical direction of the two-dimensional vibrating granular bed and increased with the increase of the vibrational acceleration and the vibrational velocity. The influence of the vibration conditions on these transport properties is discussed in the paper. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
