84934312505	Ground traffic signs recognition based on Zernike moments and SVM	In this paper, we propose an approach for recognizing ground traffic signs based on Zernike moments and support vector machine. Traditional traffic signs recognition was focus on the signs beside road, but there are relatively few researches on the ground traffic signs recognition. Ground traffic signs are important indication signs to indicate the carriageway. During the process of vehicle running, drivers need to judge which carriageway they are in, and select the right carriageway according to the itinerary planning. In order to recognize different traffic signs, we propose that using Zernike moments as the features of traffic signs, and SVM is used to classify the features. Real road scene images are used to evaluate the performance, and five classes of traffic signs are considered. Simulations show that our approach can recognize ground traffic signs effectively and practically.

84936886972	Q-learning based network selection for WCDMA/WLAN heterogeneous wireless networks	This paper investigates the problem of network selection in access control for heterogeneous networks of WCDMA/WLAN. To optimize the network selection decision policy, an optimization equation is defined with the objective of maximizing the total rewards, and then a new Q-learning Based Network Selection (QBNS) mechanism is proposed to solve the equation. In the QBNS Algorithm, Q-learning algorithm is employed by taking both of the network capacity and the quality of service (QoS) requirements of users into account. In addition, the network states are analyzed by considering interference power of WCDMA subnet and channel busyness ratio of WLAN subnet. Simulation results show that the proposed QBNS scheme can obtain lower call blocking probability and much higher total reward performance than the traditional Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) Algorithm.

58049122987	Two-step imaging method and resolution analysis for UWB through wall imaging	Through wall imaging (TWI) is one of the applications of ultra wideband (UWB) that attracts recent interests for its capability to penetrate the common wall materials. However, in the multi targets imaging scenario, false imaging is a crucial problem leading to the failure of imaging and generating the false target. This paper proposes a two-step imaging method for UWB TWI and analyzes the imaging resolution. The proposed imaging method theoretically solves the problem during the imaging processing. Based on the proposed method, imaging resolution for TWI is analyzed and derived. The results show that the imaging resolution is directly decided by the imaging system time resolution and the imaging method. So it is concluded that the imaging signal with good time resolution, such as UWB short pulse, will result in a good imaging resolution. © 2008 IEEE.

84861772664	Energy efficient access point selection and signal projection for accurate indoor positioning	We propose a method to improve positioning accuracy while reducing energy consumption in an indoor Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) environment. First, we intelligently and jointly select the subset of Access Points (APs) used in positioning via Maximum Mutual Information (MVH) criterion. Second, we propose Orthogonal Locality Preserving Projection (OLPP) to reduce the redundancy among selected APs. OLPP effectively extracts the intrinsic location features in situations where previous linear signal projection techniques failed to do, while maintaining computational efficiency. Third, we show that the combination of AP selection and OLPP simultaneously exploits their complementary advantages while avoiding the drawbacks. Experimental results indicate that, compared with the widely used weighted K-nearest neighbor and maximum likelihood estimation method, the proposed method leads to 21.8% (0.49 m) positioning accuracy improvement, while decreasing the computation cost by 65.4%.

84887734803	Kalman/map filtering-aided fast normalized cross correlation-based Wi-Fi fingerprinting location sensing	A Kalman/map filtering (KMF)-aided fast normalized cross correlation (FNCC)-based Wi-Fi fingerprinting location sensing system is proposed in this paper. Compared with conventional neighbor selection algorithms that calculate localization results with received signal strength (RSS) mean samples, the proposed FNCC algorithm makes use of all the on-line RSS samples and reference point RSS variations to achieve higher fingerprinting accuracy. The FNCC computes efficiently while maintaining the same accuracy as the basic normalized cross correlation. Additionally, a KMF is also proposed to process fingerprinting localization results. It employs a new map matching algorithm to nonlinearize the linear location prediction process of Kalman filtering (KF) that takes advantage of spatial proximities of consecutive localization results. With a calibration model integrated into an indoor map, the map matching algorithm corrects unreasonable prediction locations of the KF according to the building interior structure. Thus, more accurate prediction locations are obtained. Using these locations, the KMF considerably improves fingerprinting algorithm performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the FNCC algorithm with reduced computational complexity outperforms other neighbor selection algorithms and the KMF effectively improves location sensing accuracy by using indoor map information and spatial proximities of consecutive localization results. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84887344991	A reinforcement sensor embedded vertical handoff controller for vehicular heterogeneous wireless networks	Vehicular communication platforms that provide real-time access to wireless networks have drawn more and more attention in recent years. IEEE 802.11p is the main radio access technology that supports communication for high mobility terminals, however, due to its limited coverage, IEEE 802.11p is usually deployed by coupling with cellular networks to achieve seamless mobility. In a heterogeneous cellular/802.11p network, vehicular communication is characterized by its short time span in association with a wireless local area network (WLAN). Moreover, for the media access control (MAC) scheme used for WLAN, the network throughput dramatically decreases with increasing user quantity. In response to these compelling problems, we propose a reinforcement sensor (RFS) embedded vertical handoff control strategy to support mobility management. The RFS has online learning capability and can provide optimal handoff decisions in an adaptive fashion without prior knowledge. The algorithm integrates considerations including vehicular mobility, traffic load, handoff latency, and network status. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can adaptively adjust the handoff strategy, allowing users to stay connected to the best network. Furthermore, the algorithm can ensure that RSUs are adequate, thereby guaranteeing a high quality user experience. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84897528808	Motion adaptive vertical handoff in cellular/WLAN heterogeneous wireless network	In heterogeneous wireless network, vertical handoff plays an important role for guaranteeing quality of service and overall performance of network. Conventional vertical handoff trigger schemes are mostly developed from horizontal handoff in homogeneous cellular network. Basically, they can be summarized as hysteresis-based and dwelling-timer-based algorithms, which are reliable on avoiding unnecessary handoff caused by the terminals dwelling at the edge of WLAN coverage. However, the coverage of WLAN is much smaller compared with cellular network, while the motion types of terminals can be various in a typical outdoor scenario. As a result, traditional algorithms are less effective in avoiding unnecessary handoff triggered by vehicle-borne terminals with various speeds. Besides that, hysteresis and dwelling-timer thresholds usually need to be modified to satisfy different channel environments. For solving this problem, a vertical handoff algorithm based on Q-learning is proposed in this paper. Q-learning can provide the decider with self-adaptive ability for handling the terminals' handoff requests with different motion types and channel conditions. Meanwhile, Neural Fuzzy Inference System (NFIS) is embedded to retain a continuous perception of the state space. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve lower unnecessary handoff probability compared with the other two conventional algorithms. © 2014 Limin Li et al.

74049141343	Universal steganalysis based on statistical models using reorganization of block-based DCT coefficients	The goal of stganography is to hide information into media without disclosing the fact of existing communication. Currently, stganography such as least significant bit (LSB), quantization index modulation (QIM) and spread spectrum (SS), has become increasingly widespread. Steganalysis as a counterpart of stganography is to detect the presence of it. In this paper, we present a new universal steganalysis method based on statistical models of the image's discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients. In fact, the block-based DCT by proper reorganization of its coefficients can have similar characteristics to wavelet transforms. The presented universal steganalysis method utilizes these characteristics to build statistical models of the image and its prediction-error image. Features extracted from the re-organization DCT blocks of host images and theirs prediction-error images and features extracted from steg images and theirs prediction-error images are used to train the SVM classifier. In the testing, features from those potential images are inputted the trained-well classifier to determine where the potential images are stego images or not. The experiments have shown that the proposed method outperforms in general prior-arts of steganalysis methods based on wavelet transform domain. © 2009 IEEE.

Based on Bayes' probability theory, the traditional probability positioning algorithm converts the new sample location coordinates corresponding to the posterior probability to a priori marginal probability, which leads to the reference point having the greatest product for the estimated location as the terminal coordinates. However, due to the limited quantity of recorded signal strength in the offline phase, new recorded signal strength, different from any signal strengths in the Radio map, will appear in the on-line phase, which means the reference point may not completely characterize the signal strength distribution of this point and result in a poorer poisoning accuracy Therefore, based on the accuracy of enhanced probabilistic location algorithm, this paper proposes to use Gaussian and polynomial continuous curve to realize the least square fitting for the original signal discrete intensity distribution, which achieves to improve the positioning accuracy.

As far as we know, although the DDPAs, like nearest neighbor (NN), K nearest neighbors (KNN) and weighted KNN (WKNN) algorithms, have been widely utilized for the indoor and outdoor location based services (LBS), the guarantee of location accuracy and precision has always been one of the significant compelling problems. Therefore, in response to this challenging task, the expected errors and associated confidence probabilities are mathematically deduced by the assumptions of logarithmic attenuation model and Gaussian distributions of received radio signal strength (RSS) at the receiver. However, because of the non line of sight (NLOS) property, time-varying interference and multipath effect, the measured radio strength varies a lot in the real-world indoor environment. Therefore, in order to fill this gap, a novel adaptive autocorrelation preprocessing approach is utilized to eliminate the singular strength from the original prestored radio map and improve the matching accuracy of DDPAs. Finally, compared with traditional DDPAs without adaptive autocorrelation preprocessing, the feasibility and effectiveness of the adaptive autocorrelation-based DDPAs are verified by approximately decreasing the average errors from 1.13m to 0.75m. © 2011 Academy Publisher.

So in this paper, based on the analysis of the PoC over LTE system architecture, we propose to make a proper queuing model by using of the Queuing theory. Extended Erlang B formula is improved by implementing a more appropriate formula that is suit for the PoC over LTE. And the retrial calling percentage is concerned in the proposed model. The simulation result shows that the proposed method is more accurate and performs well to predict the blocking probability. © 2011 IEEE.

84858980573	On the statistical errors of RADAR location sensor networks with built-in Wi-Fi gaussian linear fingerprints	The expected errors of RADAR sensor networks with linear probabilistic location fingerprints inside buildings with varying Wi-Fi Gaussian strength are discussed. As far as we know, the statistical errors of equal and unequal-weighted RADAR networks have been suggested as a better way to evaluate the behavior of different system parameters and the deployment of reference points (RPs). However, up to now, there is still not enough related work on the relations between the statistical errors, system parameters, number and interval of the RPs, let alone calculating the correlated analytical expressions of concern. Therefore, in response to this compelling problem, under a simple linear distribution model, much attention will be paid to the mathematical relations of the linear expected errors, number of neighbors, number and interval of RPs, parameters in logarithmic attenuation model and variations of radio signal strength (RSS) at the test point (TP) with the purpose of constructing more practical and reliable RADAR location sensor networks (RLSNs) and also guaranteeing the accuracy requirements for the location based services in future ubiquitous context-awareness environments. Moreover, the numerical results and some real experimental evaluations of the error theories addressed in this paper will also be presented for our future extended analysis. © 2012 by the authors.

84859629032	Moving WLAN terminal indoor positioning algorithm based on non-parameter auxiliary particle filter	Currently, indoor positioning system has been got more and more attention, not only because the GPS signal cannot be received in the indoor building environment, but also the emerging indoor location based services are in great need. WLAN indoor positioning, as one of the most prominent indoor positioning systems, efficiently enhances the functions of the WLAN system and achieves high positioning accuracy for the moving WLAN terminal. However, the dynamical moving attribute of the terminals troubles the WLAN indoor positioning application. This paper proposes an algorithm to achieve high positioning accuracy for the moving WLAN terminal based on the non-parameter auxiliary particle filter. The proposed method not only avoids the pattern matching algorithm, which is dependent on the accumulating time, but also well uses the current observation vector effectively to reduce the particle degeneration. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves WLAN indoor positioning accuracy at 2 m (75.1% confidence probability), which well meets the requirements of the WLAN indoor positioning system for the moving WLAN terminal. © 2011 by Binary Information Press.

84859634313	Joint access point selection and local discriminant embedding for energy efficient and accurate Wi-Fi positioning	We propose a novel method for improving Wi-Fi positioning accuracy while reducing the energy consumption of mobile devices. Our method presents three contributions. First, we jointly and intelligently select the optimal subset of access points for positioning via maximum mutual information criterion. Second, we further propose local discriminant embedding algorithm for nonlinear discriminative feature extraction, a process that cannot be effectively handled by existing linear techniques. Third, to reduce complexity and make input signal space more compact, we incorporate clustering analysis to localize the positioning model. Experiments in realistic environments demonstrate that the proposed method can lower energy consumption while achieving higher accuracy compared with previous methods. The improvement can be attributed to the capability of our method to extract the most discriminative features for positioning as well as require smaller computation cost and shorter sensing time. © 2012 KSII.

To keep balance between energy consumption on client device and positioning accuracy, AP selection strategy is always proposed to select the most discriminant APs for positioning. In this paper, we propose an intelligent AP selection method based on joint location information gain. In contrast to traditional AP selection methods which measure the discriminant ability of APs independently, we consider it jointly. By considering the correlation of the discriminant ability between different APs, more accurate measure of the discriminant ability can be taken. Besides, support vector regression (SVR) positioning algorithm is combined to estimate the location. Experiments are carried in a realistic WLAN indoor environment. Experimental results show that, by using the intelligent AP selection method, the proposed positioning algorithm maintains a high-level accuracy while reducing the energy consumption on client device significantly. © 2011 IEEE.

84863295573	Auxiliary particle filter-based WLAN indoor tracking algorithm	The particle filter (PF) has been implemented for location tracking in Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) based indoor positioning system. However, the traditional PF technology is based on the sampling importance resampling (SIR), which has the inherent blindness. Therefore, its tracking performance in WLAN indoor environment is degraded. The auxiliary particle filter (APF) can solve this problem very well by making use of the current observation information during the production of new particles, so this paper employs the auxiliary particle filter (APF) for location tracking in WLAN fingerprinting positioning system to improve the WLAN indoor tracking performance. In the simulation, the weighted k-nearest neighbors method (WKNN) is chosen as the fingerprinting positioning algorithm. Simulation results show that APF based tracking algorithm performs better than PF based tracking algorithm. The APF based WLAN indoor tracking algorithm decreases the mean tracking error by 7.7% and 26.9% than PF based tracking algorithm and WKNN algorithm respectively. © 2011 IEEE.

84863298883	Routing timer self-adaptive regulating algorithm based on MIMD loop control for MANET	The effect of topology changing caused by nodes mobility on too much overhead occupying the limited bandwidth and resource has been greatly alleviated by a routing timer self-adaptive regulating (RTSAR) algorithm based on MIMD loop control proposed for mobile ad hoc network in this paper. Served as a stable HELLO message broadcasting algorithm, RTSAR has been designed on a fairly converging mathematical model which is established to obtain a relative stable transmission pattern. By controlling the value of routing timer, RTSAR as an independent algorithm module will help the protocol be able to send more HELLO messages in a high dynamic network to avoid frequent routing discovery processes and less in a relative stable environment to save the unnecessary control packets. Results of simulations on NS2 showed that adopting RTSAR, no matter based on a table-driven protocol or on a demand one, would reduce the overhead in networks effectively while hardly bring any obvious impacts on metrics of packet successful delivery rate and the average end-to-end delay as well. © 2011 IEEE.

While extensive efforts have already been devoted to providing optimization based, distributed congestion elusion schemes for efficient bandwidth utilization and fair allocation in both wired and wireless networks, a common assumption therein is fixed link capacities, which will unfortunately limit the application scope in mobile ad hoc networks where channels are ever changing.

A local topology flapping metric (LTFM) has been established based on the changes of link connection to achieve the measurement of stability. The loop control theory has been adopted to establish the control model of the neighborhood state, so as to set up the mapping relationship with the topology change, based on which both the neighborhood state information exchange and the timeout of link with neighbors involved will be adjusted dynamically according to NSDU to ensure that the update cycle would regulate with the network environment in order to achieve the purpose of reducing the control overhead. The simulation results on NS2.34 with different nodes velocities, traffic generating rates and the network node densities shows that adopting NSDU, no matter based on a table-driven protocol or a on-demand one, would reduce the overhead effectively while hardly bring any obvious impacts on metrics of packet successful delivery rate and the average end-to-end delay as well.

84863531225	Traffic analysis on carrier accessing for WLAN indoor positioning system	Currently, the WLAN indoor positioning system attracts a lot of interests, not only because of the cheap implementation but also because of the high positioning accuracy comparing with other indoor positioning systems. The WLAN indoor positioning system contains two phases, which are offline phase and online phase. In the online phase, the WLAN equipment user (UE) has to access to the WLAN for the latest radio map and positioning software. Due to during the network allocation vector (NAV) duration, the WLAN channel is only reserved for one WLAN UE, others UEs' carrier accessing will be blocked. In addition, the blocked UE will make a retrial accessing, which will definitely introduce more traffic blocking to the WLAN. So In this paper, based on the analysis of the WLAN indoor positioning system architecture, a proper queuing model by using of the Extended Erlang B formula is proposed, which takes the retrial calling percentage into consideration in the proposed model. The simulation results show that the proposed method is more accurate and performs well to predict the blocking probability.

84866040365	Call admission control in CDMA2000/WLAN network based on user position information	In this paper, a call admission control scheme based on user position information is proposed in the context of CDMA2000 and WLAN heterogeneous networks with voice and data traffic. The user position based call admission (UPBAC) scheme is composed of a parameter measurer, an admission controller and a decision executer. When a new call or a handoff call arrives, the parameter measurer first obtains channel and load conditions of available subnetworks as well as the position and mobility information for the admission controller. The admission controller then decides whether to admit or reject the call considering both QoS and load balancing. The decision executer carries out the final actions at last. Simulation results show that UPBAC can always reduce pingpang effect while maintaining the QoS requirements in that it can appropriately admit or reject the users' admission requests. Also, the UPBAC can achieve lower blocking rate than conventional algorithms such as RSS based algorithm or WLAN first algorithm and can significantly reduce the handoff dropping rate by effective load balancing. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

However, the collusion behavior between unlicensed users harms system's efficiency and profit. Although many kinds of mechanism have been proposed to solve this problem, resisting collusion is still a tough problem. In this paper, we study the nature of collusion behavior and revenue, and model a multi-stage auction for centralized spectrum allocation. In order to balance the collusion-resistance and revenue-optimization, we propose an algorithm with unit price priority and one step revenue optimization, which can combat collusion between unlicensed users and encourage them to compete with each other so that improve system's total profit to some degree. With the simulation results, our algorithm shows a good performance on collusion-resistance and system's revenue comparing with the other two algorithms. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

There are normally two phases, the off-line and on-line phases, and the construction of radio map in the off-line phase will significantly influence the location accuracy in the on-line phase. However, the radio map which describes the mapping relationship between the physical positions of the reference points (RPs) and the recorded radio signal strength (RSS) or signal to noise ratio (SNR) always involves the cumbersome collection work. Further, thousands of Wi-Fi access points (APs) remaining idle will also bring serious concerns of the power consumption in the future. Therefore, in response to these compelling problems, we present a preliminary analysis towards the probabilistic location methods, develop the green global-greedy position estimation (3GPE) and introduce entropy deduction as a new metric for performance evaluation. Finally, our analytical expressions and simulation results with respect to the simple circle model and ideal indoor Wi-Fi regular environment demonstrate these issues and challenges. © 2012 IEEE.

In this paper, we propose a spatially localized AP selection method based on joint location information gain. In contrast to traditional AP selection methods which measure the discriminant ability of APs independently, we consider choosing APs jointly. By considering the correlation of the discriminant ability between different APs, more accurate measure of the discriminant ability of APs can be taken. Furthermore, since the optimal AP selection solution varies spatially, we incorporate a location clustering method to localize AP selection and subsequent positioning process. Finally, support vector regression (SVR) algorithm is combined to estimate the location. Experiments are carried in a realistic Wi-Fi indoor environment. Experimental results show that, by using the localized joint AP selection strategy, the proposed positioning method achieves a high-level accuracy while reducing the energy consumption on client devices significantly.

In the proposed algorithm, all the CR users are divided into several clusters, and the CR user in each cluster with the shortest distance from the fusion centre is regarded as the cluster head. The cluster head collects the local sensing information from the other CR users in the cluster, obtains the cooperative sensing result of the cluster, and then sends the result to the fusion centre which will combine the results from all the clusters by "OR rule" in order to obtain the final decision on the presence of the primary user. The simulation indicates that when the channels are perfect, the performances of the proposed algorithm and traditional algorithm without clustering are nearly the same, however, when the channels are in deep fading, the performance of the proposed algorithm is improved remarkably, and it can be increased by the decreasing of the number of clusters.

84878177418	A joint rate control and AMC algorithm for adaptive transmission systems	The traditional communication system is effectively designed for the worst-case channel state and it can not use the spectral efficiently over the time-varying multipath channel. In order to improve the spectral efficiency and ensure robust and spectrally-efficient transmission over the time-varying multipath channel, a joint rate control and adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) algorithm for adaptive transmission systems is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the proposed algorithm can formulate a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) switching table according to the offline simulation results and the target bit error rate (BER). Then, the optimal MCS is selected in MCS switching table according to the channel state information (CSI) and then passes to the transmitter and receiver to implement. So the adaptive system which always uses the optimal MCS to transmit signals uses the spectral efficiently. The simulation results validate the proposed algorithm and show that under the premise of meeting the target BER, the adaptive system performing the proposed algorithm has a higher average spectral efficiency (ASE) than that of the non-adaptive system.

The key step of manifold learning algorithm is the neighboring region selection. However, so far for the references we know, few of which propose a generally accepted algorithm to well select the neighboring region. So in this paper, we propose an adaptive neighboring selection algorithm, which successfully applies the LLE and ISOMAP algorithms in the test. It is an algorithm that can find the optimal K nearest neighbors of the data points on the manifold. And the theoretical basis of the algorithm is the approximated curvature of the data point on the manifold. Based on Riemann Geometry, Jacob matrix is a proper mathematical concept to predict the approximated curvature. By verifying the proposed algorithm on embedding Swiss roll from R3 to R2 based on LLE and ISOMAP algorithm, the simulation results show that the proposed adaptive neighboring selection algorithm is feasible and able to find the optimal value of K, making the residual variance relatively small and better visualization of the results. By quantitative analysis, the embedding quality measured by residual variance is increased 45.45% after using the proposed algorithm in LLE.

However, not all of the APs provide the contributions but interference, which will not only burden the positioning system but also results in poor positioning accuracy. To increase the positioning accuracy and decrease the computation cost of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), a novel algorithm is proposed by implementing the KNN algorithm and Information Gain Theory to bridge the gap between the Access Point selection and positioning accuracy. The experiment results indicates that, the positioning accuracy is improved by 4.76% within 2m, and meanwhile the time for positioning is decreased by 23.81%, which means the proposed algorithm successfully achieves higher positioning accuracy with less computational cost. Besides, it is also proved in this paper that contrary to the traditional concept, more APs do not always mean higher positioning accuracy; on the opposite, in our experimental environment, a relatively small scale of APs can achieve higher positioning accuracy than that of large scale of APs. © 2013 IEEE.

84883721114	A hybrid handoff strategy based on dynamic spectrum aggregation in cognitive radio system	Spectrum aggregation (SA) is known as a technology permitting a primary user (PU) or a secondary user (SU) to occupy several idle bands simultaneously for transmitting numerous data. In LTE-A scenario, users can apply SA technology for media broadcasting or network video by utilizing scatted spectrum fragments. However, it's still a problem that how the number of handoff and the delay of a secondary user can be reduced so as to accomplish the similar performance dynamically once the primary user dominates in cognitive radio system. This paper proposes a handoff strategy based on dynamic spectrum aggregation (DSA) in cognitive radio (CR) system to illustrate the spectrum handoff behavior of a secondary user. Also a backup- channel-selection strategy is advised to solve the problem of high delay brought about by the number of handoff. Finally, simulation results present that the handoff strategy based on DSA with the backup channel selection can reduce the number of handoff and shorten the delay of handoff. © 2013 IEEE.

A proactive handoff strategy was proposed and applied to the spectrum aggregation to solve this problem. According to the transition probability of the secondary user and the constraint of span, the strategy formulated a new regulation for proactive handoff of the secondary user to ensure smoothing handoff and to avoid the collision. Meanwhile, a backup channel selection method based on handoff probability was advised to cut down spectrum handoff delay and handoff number. Simulation results showed that when the average interval of PUs' arrivals was higher than 50 slots and average holding time in a sub-channel of the SU was less than 100 slots, the handoff strategy of spectrum aggregation could keep the number of handoff below 5 times and shorten the delay below 30 slots. The strategy not only guaranteed the real-time of handoff but also reduced the cost of handoff as much as possible to promote the efficiency of system.

84892992329	A spatial division clustering method and low dimensional feature extraction technique based indoor positioning system	Indoor positioning systems based on the fingerprint method are widely used due to the large number of existing devices with a wide range of coverage. However, extensive positioning regions with a massive fingerprint database may cause high computational complexity and error margins, therefore clustering methods are widely applied as a solution. However, traditional clustering methods in positioning systems can only measure the similarity of the Received Signal Strength without being concerned with the continuity of physical coordinates. Besides, outage of access points could result in asymmetric matching problems which severely affect the fine positioning procedure. To solve these issues, in this paper we propose a positioning system based on the Spatial Division Clustering (SDC) method for clustering the fingerprint dataset subject to physical distance constraints. With the Genetic Algorithm and Support Vector Machine techniques, SDC can achieve higher coarse positioning accuracy than traditional clustering algorithms. In terms of fine localization, based on the Kernel Principal Component Analysis method, the proposed positioning system outperforms its counterparts based on other feature extraction methods in low dimensionality. Apart from balancing online matching computational burden, the new positioning system exhibits advantageous performance on radio map clustering, and also shows better robustness and adaptability in the asymmetric matching problem aspect. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84896812284	A new green clustering algorithm for energy efficiency in high-density WLANs	In this paper, a new green clustering algorithm is proposed to be as a first approach in the framework of an energy efficient strategy for centralized enterprise high-density WLANs. Traditionally, in order to maintain the network coverage, all the APs within the WLAN have to be powered-on. Nevertheless, the new algorithm can power-off a large proportion of APs while the coverage is maintained as its always-on counterpart. The two main components of the new approach are the faster procedure based on K-means and the more accurate procedure based on Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), respectively. The two procedures are processes in parallel for different designed requirements and there is information interaction in between. In order to implement the new algorithm, EA is applied to handle the optimization of multiple objectives. Moreover, we adapt the method for selection and recombination, and then introduce a new operator for mutation. This paper also presents simulations in scenarios modeled with ray-tracing method and FDTD technique, and the results show that about 67% to 90% of energy consumption can be saved while it is able to maintain the original network coverage during periods when few users are online or the traffic load is low. © 2014 KSII.

84899407905	SVM-based spectrum mobility prediction scheme in mobile cognitive radio networks	Spectrum mobility as an essential issue has not been fully investigated in mobile cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In this paper, a novel support vector machine based spectrum mobility prediction (SVM-SMP) scheme is presented considering time-varying and space-varying characteristics simultaneously in mobile CRNs. The mobility of cognitive users (CUs) and the working activities of primary users (PUs) are analyzed in theory. And a joint feature vector extraction (JFVE) method is proposed based on the theoretical analysis. Then spectrum mobility prediction is executed through the classification of SVM with a fast convergence speed. Numerical results validate that SVM-SMP gains better short-time prediction accuracy rate and miss prediction rate performance than the two algorithms just depending on the location and speed information. Additionally, a rational parameter design can remedy the prediction performance degradation caused by high speed SUs with strong randomness movements. © 2014 Yao Wang et al.

As the static fingerprint database in traditional WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) indoor algorithm does not adapt to environmental changes, which cause the signals to change over time even at the same location, present a challenging task for indoor location estimation. To this end, we propose a new method, using regression analysis to learn the relationship between sparse located reference points and that received by the mobile device at predefined locations. We can adaptive update part of the static fingerprint database through real-time signal strength received from reference points without the need to rebuild the database repeatedly.

And it combines information entropy theory with clustering and multiple regression analysis. Through collecting data and testing our algorithm in a realistic WLAN environment, we show that our algorithm can be much higher in accuracy as compared to the traditional positioning methods, while reducing the online stage computational cost.

84914669642	Green wireless local area network received signal strength dimensionality reduction and indoor localization based on fingerprint algorithm	Green wireless local area network (WLAN) is an emerging technology to achieve both the purposes of power conservation and high-speed accessing to the Internet because of the working on-demand strategy adoption and high density access points (APs) deployment. Although it is good news to data traffic service, Green WLAN brings severe challenges to the indoor localization service based on fingerprint algorithm. Redundant APs will greatly enlarge the radio map and introduce a much heavier computation burden to the terminal for localization in the online phase. In addition, APs in Green WLAN are powered on and off to make balances between data traffic service demand and energy saving goals so that the received signal strength (RSS) sampled online and recorded in the radio map offline are rarely matched in the same detected AP number, which leads to asymmetric matching problem occurring in the fingerprint algorithm. In this paper, we propose to make a nonlinear dimensionality reduction on the RSS by local discriminant embedding algorithm to realize both the computation burden decreasing and asymmetric matching problem resolving for the fingerprint algorithm in Green WLAN. The simulation results show that our proposed methods could effectively reduce the computation burden in the online phase and make the fingerprint algorithm operate more robustly when the RSS is reduced to the intrinsic dimensionality in Green WLAN.

84920971177	Temporary access selection technology in WIFI networks	Currently, increasing numbers of access points (AP) are being deployed in enterprise offices, campuses and municipal downtowns for flexible Internet connectivity, but most of these access points are idle or redundant most of the time, which causes significant energy waste. Therefore, with respect to power conservation, applying energy efficient strategies in WIFI networks is strongly advocated. One feasible method is dynamically managing network resources, particularly APs, by powering devices on or off. However, when an AP is powered on, the device is initialized through a long boot time, during which period clients cannot be associated with it; therefore, the network performance would be greatly impacted. In this paper, based on a global view of an entire WLAN, we propose an AP selection technology, known as Temporary Access Selection (TAS). The criterion of TAS is a fusion metric consisting of two evaluation indexes which are based on throughput and battery life, respectively. TAS is both service and clients’ preference specific through balancing the data rate, battery life and packet size. TAS also works well independently in traditional WLANs in which no energy efficient strategy is deployed. Moreover, this paper demonstrates the feasibility and performance of TAS through experiments and simulations with Network Simulator version 3 (NS3).
