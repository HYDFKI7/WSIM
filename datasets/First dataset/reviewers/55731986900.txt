33750480232	Differential reactions of microglia to brain metastasis of lung cancer	The brain is a common metastatic site for various types of cancers, especially lung cancer. Patients with brain metastases have a poor prognosis in spite of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. It is postulated that immune cells in the brain may play a major role in cancer metastasis, dormancy, and relapse. Although microglia may serve as a major component in the brain immune system, the interaction between metastatic cancer cells and microglia is still largely unknown and remains to be elucidated. In this study, we have investigated microglial reactions in brain tissues with metastatic lung cancer cells and evaluated the cytotoxic effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglia on metastatic lung cancer cells in vitro. In the vicinity of metastatic lung cancer mass in the brain, microglia showed signs of significant activation. There was an obvious increase in the number of microglia labeled with ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (lba-1) antibody, a specific marker of microglia. The microglia were observed to form a clear boundary between the tumor mass and normal brain tissue. In the region where the tumor mass was situated, only a few microglia expressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), indicating differential activation in those microglia. The supernatant from LPS-activated microglia induced apoptosis of metastatic lung cancer cells in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, at lower concentrations of activated microglial supernatant, trophic effects on cancer cells were observed, some lung cancer cells being insensitive to microglial cytotoxicity. Together with the observation that TNF-α alone induced proliferation of the tumor cells, the findings provide possible clues to the mechanism involved in metastasis of lung cancer cells to the brain.

35649000433	γ-Cyclodextrin: A review on enzymatic production and applications	Cyclodextrins are cyclic α-1,4-glucans that are produced from starch or starch derivates using cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase). The most common forms are α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins. This mini-review focuses on the enzymatic production, unique properties, and applications of γ-cyclodextrin as well as its difference with α- and β-cyclodextrins. As all known wild-type CGTases produce a mixture of α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins, the obtaining of a CGTase predominantly producing γ-cyclodextrin is discussed. Recently, more economic production processes for γ-cyclodextrin have been developed using improved γ-CGTases and appropriate complexing agents. Compared with α- and β-cyclodextrins, γ-cyclodextrin has a larger internal cavity, higher water solubility, and more bioavailability, so it has wider applications in many industries, especially in the food and pharmaceutical industries. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

35948957746	Effect of donor rat age on the angiogenesis of acute myocardial infarction rats following mesenchymal stem cell transplantation	Aim: Stem cell transplantation can improve heart function through improving angiogenesis of the infarction region. The study was aimed to determine the effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation in rats with different ages and verify the influence of the transplantation on the angiogenesis after acute myocardial infarction. Methods: The experiment was carried out in the Hypertension Institute of Fujian Province from February 2006 to May 2007. 1 Clean-grade SD rats were provided by Experiment Animal Company of Shanghai. MSCs were harvested from mate SD rats aged 2 weeks and mate SD rats aged 1 year respectively. Rats in the experiment were disposed according to the animal ethics. 2 MSCs were collected from bone marrow, cultured and passageed in vitro, then purified by density gradient centrifugation and adhesive-screening method. The apoptosis of MSCs were tested under ischemia and anoxia condition. Myocardial infarction models were randomly divided into 3 groups. Rats in the control group (n =8) were not treated with stem cell transplantation, but saline of the same volume was injected. Rats in the myocardial infarction plus old rat MSCs transplantation group (n =8) received old rat MSCs at four infarcted myocardial regions. Rats in the myocardial infarction plus young rat MSCs transplantation group (n =8) received young rat MSCs at four infarcted myocardial regions. 3 4 weeks later, blood vessel density was tested with immunohistochemistry of factor VIII. Results: All the 24 rats were involved in the result analysis. Under ischemia and anoxia condition, the number of apoptotic MSCs from old rats was more than that of young rats (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry of factor VIII showed that the myocardial infarction plus young rat MSCs transplantation group displayed more blood vessel than that of the myocardial infarction plus old rat MSCs transplantation group (P < 0.05), and the latter was more than control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: To some extent, MSCs from rats with different ages affects angiogenesis after myocardial infarction.

A series of sponge-like composites were prepared by cross-linking different amounts of hyaluronic acid (HA) and carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na). Adipic dihydrazide (ADH) was employed as the cross-linker and water-soluble 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylaminopropyl)] carbodiimide (EDC) as the carboxyl-activating agent. Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) analysis was performed to characterize the expected amide linkages in the cross-linked composites, and the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis was carried out to view the microstructures of the composites. Furthermore, the physico-chemical properties, such as swelling property, thermostability, the resistance to hyaluronidase (HAse) degradation and the antioxidant abilities against hydroxyl free radical (

58149357373	Two different proteases from Streptomyces hygroscopicus are involved in Transglutaminase activation	Transglutaminase (TGase), the only commercial enzyme in the food industry capable of introducing covalent bonds to proteins, is secreted as a zymogen (Pro-TGase) in several Streptomyces species. In previous studies, only a metalloprotease has been isolated from Streptomyces mobaraensis as an endogenous TGase-activating protease (TAP). In this study, not only an endogenous metalloprotease but also an endogenous serine protease is found to be involved in TGase activation in Streptomyces hygroscopicus. In a cell-free system, the TAP inhibitor was first precipitated with cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) to maintain TAP activity. Subsequently, different types of protease inhibitors were added to identify the TAP involved in TGase activation in S. hygroscopicus. TGase activation was inhibited by 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), indicating the involvement of serine protease and metalloprotease in the TGase activation process. Furthermore, the TAP purified from a liquid culture of S. hygroscopicus was identified as a serine protease, which is different from the TAP isolated from S. mobaraensis. In addition, Streptomyces Pro-TGases were found to have a conserved amino acid sequence preceding the N-terminal of TGase, which contained cleavage sites for both serine protease and metalloprotease. These results indicate that endogenous serine and metalloproteases are both involved in TGase activation in S. hygroscopicus. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report that an endogenous serine protease is involved in Streptomyces TGase activation. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

84867850488	Clinical experience with primary hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma: Retrospective study of 33 patients	Background: This multicenter-based retrospective study aimed to investigate the prognostic factors and report our experiences with the diagnosis and treatment of hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (HEHE), a rare malignant vascular tumor. Methods: A total of 33 patients with HEHE from two centers between 2004 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed with respect to their clinical, radiologic, and pathologic characteristics; treatment modalities and outcomes; and potential prognostic factors. Results: A total of 17 patients underwent liver resections (LRs) alone, 12 patients had transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) alone, three patients had LR followed by TACE, and one patient underwent liver transplantation (LT). The difference of overall survival (OS) between LR and TACE was not significant (p = 0.499). Older patients [≥47 years, n = 17; p = 0.035, hazard ratio (HR) = 7.0), those with symptoms (n = 17; p = 0.001, HR = 86.5], and those with an elevated serum CA19-9 level (>37 U/ml, n = 5; p = 0.018, HR = 5.0) had a poorer OS, according to univariate analysis. The presence of symptoms was validated as a prognostic factor (p = 0.012) by multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Liver resection and TACE have comparable outcomes in HEHE patients. The presence of symptoms indicates a poor prognosis. Older age and elevated serum CA19-9 are potential negative impact factors on outcome. © Société Internationale de Chirurgie 2012.

Logistics have played a particular important role where production is either of diffusion or of concentration. The transport coordination implies not only to reduce costs, but to respond quickly to final market. In the paper, an input-output model to analyze logistics flows is proposed, for supporting coordination policy at the level of the whole supply chain. Logistics flows between firms' processes are modeled and different coordination policies ranging from hierarchy to market are examined. The effects of such policies on logistics performance are evaluated.

44349088345	Surfactant protein of the Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor family inhibits transglutaminase activation in Streptomyces hygroscopicus	Transglutaminase (TGase) is widely used in the food industry for improving protein properties by catalyzing the cross-linking of proteins. In Streptomyces, TGase is secreted as a zymogen, and an activation process has been observed in liquid culture. However, the activation mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, the TGase activation process in Streptomyces hygroscopicus was investigated by biochemical approaches. In a liquid culture, Pro-TGase was secreted and gradually was converted into active TGase during the growth period; however, in a cell-free system in which cells were removed from the liquid culture, TGase activation stalled unexpectedly. Subsequently, the TGase activation process was found to be inhibited by a TGase-activating protease inhibitor (TAPI). N-Terminal amino acid sequencing and a homology search of the purified TAPI revealed that it is a member of the Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI) family. Furthermore, it was found that TAPI (0.1 mg/mL) decreased the surface tension of water from 72 to 60 mJ/m

45149095062	Identification and characterization of the human testes-specific protease 50 gene promoter	Testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50) has been identified as one of the testis-specific proteins that is expressed at high levels in approximately 92% of human breast cancer samples, making it an attractive molecular marker and a potential target for diagnosis and therapy. However, little is known about the transcriptional mechanisms controlling TSP50 gene expression. In the present study, we have characterized the 5′ regulatory region of the TSP50 gene in order to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating its expression. Analysis with a series of deletions demonstrated that a 624-bp region was essential for the basal promoter activity of the TSP50 gene. Further analysis results indicated that the two fragment regions +231 to +251 and -22 to -8, especially the putative Sp1 binding site (+237 to +239) and the putative CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) binding site (-15 to -13), are more important for the basal transcription activity of the human TSP50 promoter. Overexpression of Sp1 and C/EBPβ transcriptional factors upregulated the activities of the TSP50 promoter. Taken together, these results will help to better understand the role of the TSP50 gene in signal-dependent transcriptional regulation, and to develop new reagents for therapeutic downregulation of the TSP50 gene in human breast cancer. © Copyright 2008, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

47749124974	Enhanced hyaluronic acid production by a two-stage culture strategy based on the modeling of batch and fed-batch cultivation of Streptococcus zooepidemicus	This study aimed to enhance hyaluronic acid (HA) production by a two-stage culture strategy based on the modeling of batch and fed-batch culture of Streptococcus zooepidemicus. Batch culture had higher specific HA synthesis rate while fed-batch culture had higher specific cell growth rate. The lower specific HA synthesis rate in fed-batch culture resulted from the competition of cell growth for the common precursors at a low substrate concentration. Based on the modeling of batch and fed-batch culture of S. zooepidemicus, a two-stage culture strategy was proposed to enhance HA production. S. zooepidemicus were cultured in a fed-batch mode with sucrose concentration maintained at 1.0 ± 0.2 g/L during 0-8 h and then batch culture was performed during 8-20 h with an initial sucrose concentration of 15 g/L. With the proposed two-stage culture strategy, HA production was increased to 6.6 g/L compared with 5.0 g/L in batch culture with the same total sucrose. The enhanced HA production by the proposed two-stage culture strategy resulted from the decreased inhibition of cell growth and the increased transformation rate of sucrose to HA. © 2008.

47849123417	Influence of culture modes on the microbial production of hyaluronic acid by Streptococcus zooepidemicus	The principal objective of this study was to assess the effects of culture modes including batch culture, pulse fed-batch culture, constant feeding rate fed-batch culture, and exponential fed-batch culture on the production of hyaluronic acid (HA) by Streptococcus zooepidemicus. Batch cultures had the highest levels of HA productivity, whereas fed-batch cultures were more favorable with regard to cell growth, and exponential fed-batch cultures evidenced the highest cell concentrations. A two-step culture model was proposed to enhance HA production: an exponential fed-batch culture was conducted prior to 8 h and then sucrose supplementation was applied for 8 h to start the batch fermentation of S. zooepidemicus. HA production and productivity were increased by 36 and 37% in the proposed two-step culture process as compared with that observed in the batch culture, respectively. The proposed two-step culture model can be applied in the production of secondary metabolites, and particularly of the exopolysaccharides. © KSBB.

49449118814	Differential methylation of TSP50 and mTSP50 genes in different types of human tissues and mouse spermatic cells	Earlier studies identified human TSP50 as a testis-specific gene that encoded a threonine protease. Most importantly, TSP50 could be a cancer/testis antigen since there was a high frequency of reactivation in breast cancer biopsies. It was also found to be negatively regulated by the p53 gene. To further characterize this gene, we recently examined the DNA methylation patterns of the TSP50 gene promoter in normal human testis, as well as breast tissue and a testicular embryonic carcinoma cell line (HTECCL). Bisulfite genomic sequencing results demonstrated that the promoter exhibited mixed DNA methylation patterns in normal human testis, mainly non-methylation versus slight methylation, which could be attributed to the different stages spermatic cells go through during spermatogenesis. In contrast, it was methylated to a much greater extent in both breast tissue and HTECCL. To find out whether DNA methylation status was related to spermatogenesis stages, we analyzed DNA methylation patterns of the mTSP50 (the mouse ortholog of TSP50) promoter in spermatocytes and spermatozoa isolated from sexually mature mice. The results clearly demonstrated that each group of cells exhibited its preferential DNA methylation pattern that apparently was consistent with the gene expression status observed before. Taken together, our findings suggested that DNA methylation might regulate the TSP50 and mTSP50 gene expressions in different types of tissues and spermatic cells. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

62749084481	Effect of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells from rats of different ages on the improvement of heart function after acute myocardial infarction	Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is of therapeutic potential after ischemic injury in both experimental and clinical studies. Clinically, elderly patients are more vulnerable to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). But little is known about the characteristics of young donor-derived MSCs transplanted to old patients with AMI. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of transplanted MSCs from rats of different ages on the improvement of heart function after AMI. Methods: MSCs from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were isolated and cultured in vitro. The apoptosis characteristics of MSCs were observed under conditions of ischemia and anoxia. SD rats underwent MI received intramyocardial injection of MSCs from young donor rats (n=8), old donor rats (n=8), respectively. AMI control group received equal volume physiological saline. Immunofluorescence was used to observe the differentiation of the grafted cells into cardiomyocytes. Four weeks after cell transplantation, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VIII-factor immunohistochemistry for vessel density, TUNEL, caspase-3 for cardiomyocyte apoptosis, echocardiography and hemodynamic detection for heart function were performed. Results: The apoptosis rate of the old donor-derived MSCs group was significantly higher than that of the young donor-derived MSCs group under conditions of ischemia and anoxia (P <0.05). Engrafted MSCs survived, proliferated and differentiated into myocardium-like cells. VEGF gene expression and capillary density in the old donor-derived group were lower than those in the young donor-derived group but higher than those in the control group (P <0.05). The transplantation of old donor-derived MSCs attenuated apoptosis of cadiomyocytes in the peri-infract region compared with the control group and the effect was elevated in young donor-derived MSCs (P <0.05). The heart functions (left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricle fractional shortening (LVFS)) were improved more significantly in the old donor-derived MSCs group than in the control group and the heart function in the young donor-derived MSCs group further improved (P <0.05). Conclusions: Young donor-derived MSCs can improve heart function significantly through angiogenesis and decreasing cardiomyocyte apoptosis when transplanted to the infarcted area.

67349085160	Mutations at subsite -3 in cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase from Paenibacillus macerans enhancing α-cyclodextrin specificity	A major disadvantage of cyclodextrin production is the limited cyclodextrin product specificity of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase). Here, we described mutations of Asp372 and Tyr89 at subsite -3 in the CGTase from Paenibacillus macerans strain JFB05-01. The results showed that Asp372 and Tyr89 played important roles in cyclodextrin product specificity of CGTase. The replacement of Asp372 by lysine and Tyr89 by aspartic acid, asparagine, lysine, and arginine resulted in a shift in specificity towards the production of α-cyclodextrin, which was most apparent for the mutants D372K and Y89R. Furthermore, the changes in cyclodextrin product specificity for the single mutants D372K and Y89R could be combined in the double mutant D372K/Y89R, which displayed a 1.5-fold increase in the production of α-cyclodextrin, with a concomitant 43% decrease in the production of β-cyclodextrin when compared to the wild-type CGTase. Thus, the D372K and Y89R single and double mutants were much more suitable for the industrial production of α-cyclodextrin than the wild-type enzyme. The enhanced α-cyclodextrin specificity of these mutants might be a result of stabilizing the bent conformation of the intermediate in the cyclization reaction. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

67650601775	Telomerase reverse transcriptase activates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor independent of telomerase activity	Telomerase is almost universally required for cellular immortality and is permissive for tumorigenesis. Accumulating evidence suggests that telomerase may have roles in cellular processes independent of its role in telomere maintenance. However, the biochemical properties and the mechanisms of telomerase non-telomeric functions are unknown. In this report, we show that the telomerase catalytic component hTERT is capable of activating transcription of VEGF. We further demonstrated that the activation of VEGF expression by hTERT was independent of telomerase activity and telomere maintenance. These results suggest that hTERT has non-telomeric activity in the regulation of gene expression and provide additional insights into the role of telomerase in aging and cancer. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

67650931139	Calcium leads to further increase in glycine-enhanced extracellular secretion of recombinant α-cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase in Escherichia coli	Overexpression of recombinant genes in Escherichia coli and targeting recombinant proteins to the culture medium are highly desirable for the production of industrial enzymes. However, a major barrier is inadequate secretion of recombinant protein across the two membranes of E. coli cells. In the present study, we have attempted to circumvent this secretion problem of the recombinant a-cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (a-CGTase) from Paenibacillus macerans strain JFB05-01. It was found that glycine, as a medium supplement, could enhance the extracellular secretion of recombinant α-CGTase in E. coll. In the culture with glycine at the optimal concentration of 150 mM, the α-CGTase activity in the culture medium reached 23.5 U/mL at 40 h of culture, which was 11-fold higher than that of the culture in regular TB medium. A 2.3-fold increase in the maximum extracellular productivity of recombinant α-CGTase was also observed. However, further analysis indicated that glycine supplementation exerted impaired cell growth as demonstrated by reduced cell number and viability, increased cell lysis, and damaged cell morphology, which prevented further improvement in overall enzyme productivity.

67651108611	Effect of cutinase on the degradation of cotton seed coat in bio-scouring	In this paper the effect of cutinase on the degradation of cotton seed coat is analyzed. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy was applied to study the changes of chemical compositions in cotton seed coat epidermal layer and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to analyse cutinase depolymerization of cotton seed coat. Based on these arguments the ability of cutinase to degrade aliphatic components in cotton seed coat was verified. Positive effect of cutinase on degradation of cotton seed coat was observed with the combination of alkaline pectinase or xylanase. The removal of aliphatic components by cutinase enables other enzymes to penetrate into the inner of cotton seed coat. Cutinase can potentially improve the degradation of cotton seed coat during cotton fabric bio-scouring process. © The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg GmbH 2009.

In the three-stage agitation speed control approach, agitation speed was 200 rpm during 0-8 h, 400 rpm during 8-12 h, and 600 rpm during 12-20 h. In the two-stage DO control strategy, DO was controlled at above 10% during 0-8 h and at 5% during 8-20 h. In the PFC applied approach, PFC (3% v/v) was added at 8 h. HA production reached 5.5 g/L in the three-stage agitation speed control culture model, and 6.3 g/L in two-stage DO control culture model, and 6.6 g/L in the PFC applied culture model. Compared with the other two DO control approaches, the PFC applied approach had a lower shear stress and thus a higher HA production was achieved. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

It indicated that farinograph dough development time, dough stability, and farinograph quality number of the dough increased with the incorporation of the dried egg yolk, while the dough softness decreased. The incorporation of PLA2-treated dried egg yolk into flour has more significant effect on farinograph than that of the non-treated dried egg yolk. Extensograph resistance to extension, and area below the curve (energy) significantly increased with the addition of dried egg yolk, while extensibility decreased and the water adsorption was unchanged. The addition of dried egg yolk lead to the increase of G' (the storage modulus) and G" (loss modulus) under frequency sweep from 0.1 to 20 Hz at 1.5% strain and temperature sweep from 20 to 90 °C at 1 Hz. The microstructure of the dough showed great difference when non-treated or PLA2-treated dried egg yolk was incorporated into wheat dough. Starch granules flowed into the continuous matrix compared to the blank wheat dough. The gluten network structure of the dough was increased when PLA2-treated dried egg yolk was added. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

70349150496	Effects of lentivirus-mediated angiopoietin-1 gene modified bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells transplantation on carotid atherosclerosis	BACKGROUND: Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are easy transfected by heterologous genes, with the characteristics of Chemotaxis and congregation to injured tissues. The ability to efficiently transfer genes of interest into such cells would create a number of therapeutic opportunities. Therefore, MSCs can differentiate into vascular endothelial cells (VECs) to repair injured tunica intima.

The effects of amino acid side chain at position 47 on cyclodextrin product specificity were investigated by replacing Lys47 in the CGTase from Paenlbacillus macerans strain JFB05-01 with arginine, histidine, threonine, serine, or leucine. All of the mutations reduced a-cyclodextrin-forming activity, whereas significant increases in β-cyclodextrinforming activity were achieved. Especially, the mutations of Lys47 into threonine, serine, or leucine converted P. macerans CGTase from α-type to β/α-type. As a result, all of the mutants displayed a shift in product specificity toward the production of β-cyclodextrin. Thus, they were more suitable for the industrial production of β-cyclodextrin than the wild-type enzyme. The enhancement of β-cyclodextrin specificity might be due to weakening or removal of hydrogen-bonding interactions between the side chain of residue 47 and the bent intermediate specific for α-cyclodextrin formation. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

In this strategy, DO was controlled at above 10 ± 1% during 0-8 h and at 5 ± 0.5% during 8-18 h. The DO-shifting strategy increased the consistency index and oxygen mass transfer coefficient and decreased the flow behavior index n. With the proposed DO-shifting strategy, HA production increased from 5.0 ± 0.1 g/L to 6.3 ± 0.1 g/L. The enhanced HA production was attributed to the alleviation of carbon and energy competition between cell growth and HA synthesis. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

72149111131	Application of a novel cavern volume controlled culture model to microbial hyaluronic acid production by batch culture of Streptococcus zooepidemicus	With the unique physio-chemical and biological properties, hyaluronic acid (HA) finds a wide range of applications in biomedical, cosmetic and healthcare fields. The microbial HA production is limited by poor mixing performance and low oxygen mass transfer rate. In this work, a novel cavern volume controlled culture model was proposed and applied to microbial HA production by batch culture of Streptococcus zooepidemicus. In the cavern model-controlled culture process, the complete mixing was achieved via the dynamic control of agitation speed in the range from 50 rpm to 470 rpm, and HA yield increased from 5.5 ± 0.1 g/L of the control to 6.2 ± 0.1 g/L. There was not significant influence of the model-controlled culture on the molecular weight of HA compared with the control, in which the agitation speed was kept at 294 rpm. With better mixing performance and improved oxygen mass transfer efficiency, the cavern volume controlled culture model may be helpful for the production of the other microbial biopolymers like xanthan gum, curdlan and poly(glutamic acid).

72849148224	Analysis of the chemical composition of cotton seed coat by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy	To improve knowledge on the biodegradation of cotton seed coat fragments in bioscouring, in this study Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy was performed to analyze the composition of cotton seed coat. Microscope observation showed that cotton seed coat has a five-layer structure: epidermal layer, outer pigment layer, colorless layer, palisade layer, and inner pigment layer. Analysis of the FT-IR spectra from each layer shows that cutin, wax, cellulose, and pectin are the main components of the epidermal layer, while pectin and hemicellulose are the main constituents of the palisade layer, as well as aromatic and polyphenol, which are commonly considered as lignins. The main component of the outer and inner pigment layers is lignin. The results suggest that cellulase, pectinase, xylanase, and lignin oxidase are suitable for degradation of cotton seed coat. In addition, cutinase might be very promising in improving the enzymatic degradation of cotton seed coat. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

74149088230	Delayed supplementation of glycine enhances extracellular secretion of the recombinant α-cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase in Escherichia coli	The targeting of recombinant proteins for secretion to the culture medium of Escherichia coli presents significant advantages over cytoplasmic or periplasmic expression. However, a major barrier is inadequate secretion across two cell membranes. In the present study, we attempted to circumvent this secretion problem of the recombinant α-cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (α-CGTase) from Paenibacillus macerans strain JFB05-01. It was found that glycine could promote extracellular secretion of the recombinant α-CGTase for which one potential mechanism might be the increase in membrane permeability. However, further analysis indicated that glycine supplementation resulted in impaired cell growth, which adversely affected overall recombinant protein production. Significantly, delayed supplementation of glycine could control cell growth impairment exerted by glycine. As a result, if the supplementation of 1% glycine was optimally carried out at the middle of the exponential growth phase, the α-CGTase activity in the culture medium reached 28.5 U/ml at 44 h of culture, which was 11-fold higher than that of the culture in regular terrific broth medium and 1.2-fold higher than that of the culture supplemented with 1% glycine at the beginning of culture. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

77953639567	Long persistence of EV71 specific nucleotides in respiratory and feces samples of the patients with Hand-Foot-Mouth Disease after recovery	Background: EV71 is associated with the fatal cases of brain stem encephalitis during large HFMD outbreaks from 1998 to 2008. EV71 may continuously shed from upper respiratory tracts and feces of HFMD patients for relatively long time after recovery. However, the persistence of viruses in the patients' secretions and excretions is not clear.Methods: Serial throat swabs and feces of 34 definitely diagnosed patients, including 30 mild cases and 4 severe cases, were traced and collected with the interval of 2 to 4 days for up to 32 and 48 days, respectively, and tested by a nested RT-PCR.Results: The EV-71 specific sequences were identified by a Nested RT-PCR in all specimens of 0-4 days, and 5-8 days. The positive rates of EV71 in throat swabs dropped markedly to 42.86% during 9-12 days, and maintained at 20-30% during 13-24 days, while that in feces reduced to 71.43% during 9-12 days, and maintained roughly 20% till 37-40 days. EV71 nucleotide of 36.36% cases disappeared simultaneously both in throats and feces, 39.39% cases showed longer persistence of EV71 nucleotides in feces, and 21.21% were longer in throats. The longest duration of shedding observed was 24 days for throat swabs and 42 days for fecal specimens.Conclusions: EV71 shedding from respiratory tract may continue for nearly four weeks after onset, but its excretion through feces can persist more than five weeks. © 2010 Han et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77957163489	Basic FGF downregulates TSP50 expression via the ERK/Sp1 pathway	Previous studies demonstrated that the expression of testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50) was increased in breast cancer cells and that overexpression of TSP50 can promote tumorigenesis. Thus, it is important to identify the regulatory mechanisms of TSP50 for tumor therapy. In this study, we elucidated the mechanism underlying TSP50 downregulation by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). We used MDA-MB-231 and HEK293T cell lines to address this issue. RT-PCR and promoter activity assays indicated that bFGF downregulates TSP50 expression via transcriptional activation. We next investigated the signaling pathway that mediated the effect of bFGF on TSP50 transcription, and identified that bFGF induced the phosphorylation of ERK and Sp1. An ERK inhibitor suppressed Sp1 phosphorylation and bFGF-reduced TSP50 expression at the mRNA level. In addition, the dominant negative (DN) mutants of ERK and Sp1 both suppressed the reduction of TSP50 by bFGF. Deletion and mutation analyses indicated that the Sp1 site, located within the +237/+239 region of the human TSP50 promoter, is the major responsive element for bFGF. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that bFGF mediates TSP50 downregulation by ERK activation, leading to the phosphorylation of Sp1 in this process. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77958497858	A deep-coverage BAC library for Ponkan mandarin and its further use in screening ethylene regulated genes	A deep-coverage bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of Yanxiwanlu Ponkan, a late maturing cultivar, was constructed and evaluated. Results showed that the library contained a total of 61,000 clones. Restriction analysis indicated that the DNA insert sizes ranged from 30 to 170. kb with an average of ∼82. kb. No empty clone was found. Therefore, the library should cover ∼13.6-fold of the citrus genome. Continuous sub-cultivation of 5 randomly chosen clones for up to 100 generations showed no detectable change in their restriction profiles. To demonstrate the application of the library in discovery of genes, 7 ethylene-regulated genes were screened by PCR amplification from hierarchically pooled library clones with gene-specific primers. Five positive clones, each representing a different gene, were thus identified from 3840 clones. Sequencing of the clones showed that all of them matched the expected genes, indicating that the library was highly representative. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The experimental results indicate that the quenching mechanism of fluorescence of HHb by Sal B is a static quenching procedure, the binding reaction is spontaneous, and the hydrophobic interactions play a major role in binding of Sal B to HHb. Based on Försters theory of non-radiative energy transfer, the binding distance between Sal B and the inner tryptophan residues of HHb was determined to be 2.64 nm. The synchronous fluorescence experiment revealed that Sal B can not lead to the microenvironmental changes around the Tyr and Trp residues of HHb, and the binding site of Sal B on HHb is located at α

79959273231	Differential expression of oncogenic miRNAs in proliferating and senescent human fibroblasts	miRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that play fundamental roles through the post-transcriptional regulation of target mRNAs. miRNAs have been shown to regulate a broad spectrum of biological activities, including development, differentiation, cell death, and oncogenesis. However, little is known about their contribution to cellular senescence. The authors analyzed the expression of 576 miRNAs in proliferating and senescent normal human fibroblasts by microarray, and identified 12 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in proliferating and senescent fibroblasts. Interestingly, all six miRNAs that were down-regulated in senescent cells had been previously reported to be aberrantly expressed in tumor cells. It was further showed that inhibition of miR-17-5p and miR-20a by 2′-O-methyl antisense oligoribonucleotides resulted in the induction of senescent phenotypes in WI-38 cells. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The (PVA-SbQ)/hyaluronic acid gel were made by mixing the solutions of PVA-SbQ and hyaluronic acid followed by UV light polymerization. Its structure was examined by means of FT-IR and SEM. FT-IR results show that the (PVA-SbQ)/hyaluronic acid gel was photo cross-linked under UV light, SEM results show that it has the porous structure and with the increase of the content of PVA-SbQ, aperture gradually decrease. The apparent viscosity of the (PVA-SbQ)/hyaluronic acid solution (m(HA):m(PVA-SbQ) =1:3) under different UV irradiation time and swelling curves of the gel were studied. The results show that the (PVA-SbQ)/hyaluronic acid solution began to conversion from dilute gel state to solid gel state at the irradiation time of 450s. The ratio of the drug release could be controlled by the irradiation time and pH value.

79960128557	Regulation of cellular senescence by the essential caveolar component PTRF/Cavin-1	Polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF, also known as Cavin-1) is an essential component in the biogenesis and function of caveolae. Here, we show that PTRF expression is increased in senescent human fibroblasts. Importantly, overexpression of PTRF induced features characteristic of cellular senescence, whereas reduced PTRF expression extended the cellular replicative lifespan. Interestingly, we found that PTRF localized primarily to the nuclei of young and quiescent WI-38 human fibroblasts, but translocated to the cytosol and plasma membrane during cellular senescence. Furthermore, electron microscopic analysis demonstrated an increased number of caveolar structures in senescent and PTRF-transfected WI-38 cells. Our data suggest that the role of PTRF in cellular senescence is dependent on its targeting to caveolae and its interaction with caveolin-1, which appeared to be regulated by the phosphorylation of PTRF. Taken together, our findings identify PTRF as a novel regulator of cellular senescence that acts through the p53/p21 and caveolar pathways. © 2011 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

The oxidation of OA by sodium periodate in mixed solvents formed a carboxyl group or vicinal diol to make the hydrophobic groups to hydrophilic groups on the surface of the nanoparticles. The characterization of nanoparticles indicated that the phase transfer based on the oxidation of OA was successful performed without change in the size and shape of the iron oxide nanoparticles. The hydrophilic groups on the iron oxide surface stabilized the nanoparticles in aqueous solution and the oxidized nanoparticles can be applied to bimolecular immobilization.

80053473354	Visual detection of high-risk human papillomavirus genotypes 16, 18, 45, 52, and 58 by loop-mediated isothermal amplification with hydroxynaphthol blue dye	A simple, rapid, sensitive, qualitative, colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with hydroxynaphthol blue dye (HNB) was established to detect high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes 16, 18, 45, 52, and 58. All initial validation studies with the control DNA proved to be type specific. The colorimetric type-specific LAMP assay could achieve a sensitivity of 10 to 100 copies at 63°C for 65 min, comparable to that of real-time PCR. In order to evaluate the reliability of HPV type-specific LAMP, the assay was further evaluated with HPV DNAs from a panel of 294 clinical specimens whose HPV status was previously determined with a novel one-step typing method with multiplex PCR. The tested panel comprised 108 HPV DNA-negative samples and 186 HPV-DNA-positive samples of 14 genotypes. The results showed that the sensitivity of HPV type-specific LAMP for HPV types 16, 18, 45, 52, and 58 was 100%, 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, and the specificity was 100%, 98.5%, 100%, 98.8%, and 99.2%, respectively, compared with a novel one-step typing method with multiplex PCR. No cross-reactivity with other HPV genotypes was observed. In conclusion, this qualitative and colorimetric LAMP assay has potential usefulness for the rapid screening of HPV genotype 16, 18, 45, 52, and 58 infections, especially in resource-limited hospitals or rural clinics of provincial and municipal regions in China.

80054933495	A further insight into the biosorption mechanism of Au(III) by infrared spectrometry	Background: The interactions of microbes with metal ions form an important basis for our study of biotechnological applications. Despite the recent progress in studying some properties of Au(III) adsorption and reduction by Bacillus megatherium D01 biomass, there is still a need for additional data on the molecular mechanisms of biosorbents responsible for their interactions with Au(III) to have a further insight and to make a better exposition.Results: The biosorption mechanism of Au(III) onto the resting cell of Bacillus megatherium D01 biomass on a molecular level has been further studied here. The infrared (IR) spectroscopy on D01 biomass and that binding Au(III) demonstrates that the molecular recognition of and binding to Au(III) appear to occur mostly with oxygenous- and nitrogenous-active groups of polysaccharides and proteins in cell wall biopolymers, such as hydroxyl of saccharides, carboxylate anion of amino-acid residues (side-chains of polypeptide backbone), peptide bond (amide I and amide II bands), etc.; and that the active groups must serve as nucleation sites for Au(0) nuclei growth. A further investigation on the interactions of each of the soluble hydrolysates of D01, Bacillus licheniformis R08, Lactobacillus sp. strain A09 and waste Saccharomyces cerevisiae biomasses with Au(III) by IR spectrometry clearly reveals an essential biomacromolecule-characteristic that seems the binding of Au(III) to the oxygen of the peptide bond has caused a significant, molecular conformation-rearrangement in polypeptide backbones from β-pleated sheet to α-helices and/or β-turns of protein secondary structure; and that this changing appears to be accompanied by the occurrence, in the peptide bond, of much unbound -C=O and H-N- groups, being freed from the inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding of the β-pleated sheet and carried on the helical forms, as well as by the alternation in side chain steric positions of protein primary structure. This might be reasonably expected to result in higher-affinity interactions of peptide bond and side chains with Au(III).Conclusions: The evidence suggests that the polypeptides appear to be activated by the intervention of Au(III) via the molecular reconformation and in turn react upon Au(III) actively and exert profound impacts on the course of Au(0) nucleation and crystal growth. © 2011 Lin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

80054093224	The pro-region of Streptomyces hygroscopicus transglutaminase affects its secretion by Escherichia coli	Streptomyces transglutaminase (TGase) is secreted as a zymogen (pro-TGase) in liquid cultures and is then processed by the removal of its N-terminal region, resulting in active TGase. To date, there is no report describing TGase (or pro-TGase) secretion in Escherichia coli. In this study, the pro-TGase from Streptomyces hygroscopicus was efficiently secreted by E. coli BL21(DE3) using the TGase signal peptide or the pelB signal peptide. The secreted pro-TGase was efficiently transformed into active TGase by adding dispase to the culture supernatant of the recombinant strains. Mutational analysis showed that deletion of the first six amino acids of the N-terminal of the pro-region reduced the secretion of pro-TGase, and removal of the next 10 amino acids resulted in the formation of insoluble pro-TGase. These results suggest that the pro-region of TGase is essential for its efficient secretion and solubility in E. coli. 2011 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

84055177023	Down-regulation of the cavin family proteins in breast cancer	Caveolae are abundant membrane domain on the cell surface of many mammalian cell types and are implicated in a wide range of physiological processes. The caveolae structural protein caveolin-1 is often mutated or deregulated in cancer, and cavin family protein serum deprivation response factor-related gene product that binds to C-kinase (SRBC) has been found to be epigenetically inactivated in lung, breast, and gastric cancer. Both caveolin-1 and SRBC have been proposed to function as tumor suppressors. Polymerase 1 and transcript release factor (PTRF) is the essential component for caveolae formation. The regulation of PTRF expression in cancer has not been characterized. We report here that the cavin family protein PTRF, SRBC and serum deprivation response protein were down regulated in breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor tissue. We further show that down-regulation of PTRF in breast cancer cells was associated with the promoter methylation. As caveolin-1 and cavin family proteins are required for caveolae formation and function, the reported tumor suppression function of caveolin-1 and SRBC may be due to the deregulation of caveolae and its down-stream signaling. Thus, the caveolae is a potential therapeutic target and the expression of cavin family proteins could be a useful prognostic indicator of breast cancer progression.

84155173326	The order of expression is a key factor in the production of active transglutaminase in Escherichia coli by co-expression with its pro-peptide	Background: Streptomyces transglutaminase (TGase) is naturally synthesized as zymogen (pro-TGase), which is then processed to produce active enzyme by the removal of its N-terminal pro-peptide. This pro-peptide is found to be essential for overexpression of soluble TGase in E. coli. However, expression of pro-TGase by E. coli requires protease-mediated activation in vitro. In this study, we developed a novel co- expression method for the direct production of active TGase in E. coli.Results: A TGase from S. hygroscopicus was expressed in E. coli only after fusing with the pelB signal peptide, but fusion with the signal peptide induced insoluble enzyme. Therefore, alternative protocol was designed by co-expressing the TGase and its pro-peptide as independent polypeptides under a single T7 promoter using vector pET-22b(+). Although the pro-peptide was co-expressed, the TGase fused without the signal peptide was undetectable in both soluble and insoluble fractions of the recombinant cells. Similarly, when both genes were expressed in the order of the TGase and the pro-peptide, the solubility of TGase fused with the signal peptide was not improved by the co-expression with its pro-peptide. Interestingly, active TGase was only produced by the cells in which the pro-peptide and the TGase were fused with the signal peptide and sequentially expressed. The purified recombinant and native TGase shared the similar catalytic properties.Conclusions: Our results indicated that the pro-peptide can assist correct folding of the TGase inter-molecularly in E. coli, and expression of pro-peptide prior to that of TGase was essential for the production of active TGase. The co-expression strategy based on optimizing the order of gene expression could be useful for the expression of other functional proteins that are synthesized as a precursor. © 2011 Liu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Eleven sets of chimeric primers were used to initiate the PCR, and one pair of universal primers was used for the subsequent cycles of the PCR. The specificity of GeXP-PCR for each HPV type was examined with clinical samples of single type HPV infection tested previously. The sensitivity of GeXP-PCR was evaluated by performing the assay on serial 10-fold dilutions of cloned PCR products. The GeXP-PCR achieved a sensitivity of 100 copies when all of the 11 pre-mixed plasmids containing HPV targets were present. Analyses of 124 clinical specimens using the GeXP-PCR demonstrated that the GeXP-PCR assay had comparable sensitivity and specificity to those of reported multiple PCR assay and an increased detection of HPV 11 in samples with mixed infections. In conclusion, the GeXP-PCR is a fast, sensitive, and high throughput method for the detection of multiple HPV infections. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84862321679	Delivery of a transforming growth factor β-1 plasmid to mesenchymal stem cells via cationized Pleurotus eryngii polysaccharide nanoparticles	The objective of this study was to investigate the use of cationized Pleurotus eryngii polysaccharide (CPEPS) as a nonviral gene delivery vehicle to transfer plasmid DNA encoding transforming growth factor beta-1 (pTGF-β1) into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro. Crude P. eryngii polysaccharide was purified, and then cationized by grafting spermine onto the backbone of the polysaccharide. Agarose gel electrophoresis, transmission electron microscopy, and a Nano Sense Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) were used to characterize the CPEPS-pTGF-β1 nanoparticles. The findings of cytotoxicity analysis showed that when the nanoparticles were formulated with a CPEPS/pTGF-β1 weight ratio ≥ 10:1, a greater gel retardation effect was observed during agarose gel electrophoresis. The CPEPS-pTGF-β1 nanoparticles with a weight ratio of 20:1, respectively, possessed an average particle size of 80.8 nm in diameter and a zeta potential of +17.4 ± 0.1 mV. Significantly, these CPEPS-pTGF-β1 nanoparticles showed lower cytotoxicity and higher transfection efficiency than both polyethylenimine (25 kDa) (P = 0.006, Student's t-test) and Lipofectamine™ 2000 (P = 0.002, Student's t-test). Additionally, the messenger RNA expression level of TGF-β1 in MSCs transfected with CPEPS-pTGF-β1 nanoparticles was significantly higher than that of free plasmid DNA-transfected MSCs and slightly elevated compared with that of Lipofectamine 2000-transfected MSCs. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that 92.38% of MSCs were arrested in the G1 phase after being transfected with CPEPS-pTGF-β1 nanoparticles, indicating a tendency toward differentiation. In summary, the findings of this study suggest that the CPEPS-pTGF-β1 nanoparticles prepared in this work exhibited excellent transfection efficiency and low toxicity. Therefore, they could be developed into a promising nonviral vector for gene delivery in vitro. © 2012 Deng et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84863016912	Efficient gene delivery to mesenchymal stem cells by an ethylenediamine-modified polysaccharide from mulberry leaves	This study investigates the use of a natural polysaccharide isolated from mulberry leaves as a nonviral gene vector. Ethylenediamine is chemically grafted to the backbone of a polysaccharide from mulberry leaves (MPS) to acquire nucleic acid binding affinity. A particle-size observation indicates that the cationic mulberry leaf polysaccharide (CMPS) can efficiently combine with plasmid transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) to form nanoscaled particles. In addition, the electrophoresis assay indicates a retarded plasmid migration when the CMPS/pTGF-β1 weight ratio is increased to 30:1. The in vitro cell transfection experiment is performed based on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from rat femurs and tibias, and the findings reveal that the complex with a CMPS/pTGF-β1 weight ratio of 50:1 exhibits the highest cell transfection effect, which is significantly higher than that of branched poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) (25 kDa; p = 0.001, Student's t-test) and slightly higher than Lipofectamine 2000. Moreover, the cytotoxicity assay also demonstrates that all of these tested complexes and the plasmid TGF-β1 are nontoxic to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The results of the living cell imaging confirm that more of the CMPS/plasmid TGF-β1 nanoparticles can be taken up and at a faster rate by the MSCs than by the positive control Lipofectamine 2000; these data are consistent with the transfection efficiency data. Together, these results suggest that the CMPS/pTGF-β1 nanoparticle can potentially be developed into a promising alternative for the transfer of therapeutic genes into cells.

84862945469	Simultaneous determination of five plant growth regulators in fruits by modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry	An effective method using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed and optimized to obtain a complete separation of five representative plant growth regulators (PGRs) [gibberellic acid, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), thidiazuron, forchlorfenuron, and paclobutrazol] in fruits. Extraction was performed with acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid, applying modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) methodology. LC-MS/MS conditions including composition of mobile phases and mass spectrometry (MS) conditions were evaluated to achieve the highest sensitivity in MS detection. All of the data acquisition was employed in the segmented multiple-reaction monitoring mode for the selected negative and positive transition ions. The octadecylsilyl (C18) dispersive solid-phase extraction (SPE) sorbent was found to provide the more satisfied recoveries than primary secondary amine (PSA) and graphitized carbon black (GCB) for five target PGRs. The optimized method allowed for recoveries of 76-112% for the five PGRs from fruit samples with relative standard deviation (RSD) values less than 10%. Limits of quantification (0.5-16.5 μg/kg) were lower than the maximum limit of residues established for PGRs. The results demonstrated that the developed LC-MS/MS and QuEChERS extraction method is highly effective for analyzing trace amounts of target PGRs in fruit samples. Finally, the method was successfully used to detect residual PGRs in Beijing, China, in 2010. The concentrations of 2,4-D (5.1-1503 μg/kg) and paclobutrazol (1-1381 μg/kg) found in orange and peach, respectively, suggesting that the use of these PGRs in these fruits should be regulated in China in the future. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84863462399	Lactobacillus casei combats acid stress by maintaining cell membrane functionality	Lactobacillus casei strains have traditionally been recognized as probiotics and frequently used as adjunct culture in fermented dairy products where lactic acid stress is a frequently encountered environmental condition. We have investigated the effect of lactic acid stress on the cell membrane of L. casei Zhang [wild type (WT)] and its acid-resistant mutant Lbz-2. Both strains were grown under glucose-limiting conditions in chemostats; following challenge by low pH, the cell membrane stress responses were investigated. In response to acid stress, cell membrane fluidity decreased and its fatty acid composition changed to reduce the damage caused by lactic acid. Compared with the WT, the acid-resistant mutant exhibited numerous survival advantages, such as higher membrane fluidity, higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids, and higher mean chain length. In addition, cell integrity analysis showed that the mutant maintained a more intact cellular structure and lower membrane permeability after environmental acidification. These results indicate that alteration in membrane fluidity, fatty acid distribution, and cell integrity are common mechanisms utilized by L. casei to withstand severe acidification and to reduce the deleterious effect of lactic acid on the cell membrane. This detailed comparison of cell membrane responses between the WT and mutant add to our knowledge of the acid stress adaptation and thus enable new strategies to be developed aimed at improving the industrial performance of this species under acid stress. © Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology 2012.

84863932843	Rapid determination of chlormequat in meat by dispersive solid-phase extraction and Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography (HILIC)-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry	A rapid method for analyzing trace levels of chlormequat (CQ) in meat samples by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry was developed. The samples were extracted with acetonitrile, followed by a rapid cleanup through a dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) technique with octadecyl (C18) DSPE sorbents. The chromatographic separation was achieved within 6 min using a HILIC column with 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water/acetonitrile (v/v, 40:60) as the mobile phase. Quantification was performed using a matrix-matched calibration curve, which was linear in the range of the 0.05-100 μ/L. The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated at 0.03 μ/kg for CQ on the basis of a peak to peak signal noise (S/N = 3). The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.1 μ/kg on the basis of the lowest spiked concentration with suitable precision and accuracy. The average recovery of CQ in spiked meat samples was 86.4-94.7% at 2, 20, and 200 μ/kg. Finally, this method was applied to determine CQ in the livestock and poultry meats purchased from markets in Beijing in 2011. CQ was detected in all 12 samples, and the concentration was 0.4-636.0 μ/kg. Concentrations in a chicken sample (636.0 μ/kg) and a goat meat sample (486.0 μ/kg) were found to be 15.9 and 2.43 times the corresponding Codex maximum residue limits, respectively. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84864922486	The development of a GeXP-based multiplex reverse transcription-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of sixteen human respiratory virus types/subtypes	Background: Existing standard non-molecular diagnostic methods such as viral culture and immunofluorescent (DFA) are time-consuming, labor intensive or limited sensitivity. Several multiplex molecular assays are costly. Therefore, there is a need for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens.Methods: A GeXP-based multiplex RT-PCR assay (GeXP assay) was developed to detect simultaneously sixteen different respiratory virus types/subtypes. Seventeen sets of chimeric primers were used to initiate the RT-PCR, and one pair of universal primers was used for the subsequent cycles of the RT-PCR. The specificity of the GeXP assay was examined with positive controls for each virus type/subtype. The sensitivity was evaluated by performing the assay on serial ten-fold dilutions of in vitro-transcribed RNA of all RNA viruses and the plasmids containing the Adv and HBoV target sequence. GeXP assay was further evaluated using 126 clinical specimens and compared with Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay.Results: The GeXP assay achieved a sensitivity of 20-200 copies for a single virus and 1000 copies when all of the 16 pre-mixed viral targets were present. Analyses of 126 clinical specimens using the GeXP assay demonstrated that GeXP assay and the RVP Fast assay were in complete agreement for 109/126 (88.51%) of the specimens. GeXP assay was more sensitive than the RVP Fast assay for the detection of HRV and PIV3, and slightly less sensitive for the detection of HMPV, Adv, RSVB and HBoV. The whole process of the GeXP assay for the detection of 12 samples was completed within 2.5 hours.Conclusions: In conclusion, the GeXP assay is a rapid, cost-effective, sensitive, specific and high throughput method for the detection of respiratory virus infections. © 2012 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84865388007	Microbial production of propionic acid from propionibacteria: Current state, challenges and perspectives	Propionic acid (PA) is an important building block chemical and finds a variety of applications in organic synthesis, food, feeding stuffs, perfume, paint and pharmaceutical industries. Presently, PA is mainly produced by petrochemical route. With the continuous increase in oil prices, public concern about environmental pollution, and the consumers' desire for bio-based natural and green ingredients in foods and pharmaceuticals, PA production from propionibacteria has attracted considerable attention, and substantial progresses have been made on microbial PA production. However, production of PA by propionibacteria is facing challenges such as severe inhibition of end-products during cell growth and the formation of by-products (acetic acid and succinic acid). The integration of reverse metabolic engineering and systematic metabolic engineering provides an opportunity to significantly improve the acid tolerance of propionibacteria and reduce the formation of by-products, and makes it feasible to strengthen the commercial competition of biotechnological PA production from propionibacteria to be comparable to the petrochemical route. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

84865424095	SUMOylation of AhR modulates its activity and stability through inhibiting its ubiquitination	Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a transcription factor that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) Per-Arnt-Sim homology domain (PAS) family. AhR can be activated by 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD) and once activated, it promotes the abnormal expression of cytochrome P450, leading to several diseases, including cancer. In this study, we showed that AhR is subjected to post-translational modification by SUMOylation and this modification could be reversed by SENP1. Two SUMOylation sites were identified, one in the bHLH domain (K63) and the other in the TAD domain (K510) of AhR. Substitution of either K63 or K510 with arginine resulted in reduced SUMOylation for AhR. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with TCDD led to a reduced level of SUMOylated AhR in a time-dependent manner, and this occurred mainly in the nucleus. SUMOylation of AhR enhanced its stability through inhibiting its ubiquitination. Moreover, SUMOylation also repressed the transactivation activity of AhR and this could be reversed by TCDD. These results suggested that SUMOylation of AhR might play an important role in the regulation of its function, and TCDD may activate the transcriptional activity of AhR through downregulating its SUMOylation. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84869411696	Empirical study of the relationship between listed hydropower company, and enterprise performance and low-carbon suggestions	The relationship between diversification and enterprise performance has always been a hot issue of concern, and yet the conclusions vary. At present, although most of the listed hydropower companies in our country have been under diversified operation, there is no empirical study of the diversified operation and the enterprise performance. This paper takes the relationship between enterprise performance and diversification of the listed hydropower companies as a sample and explores it thoroughly. According to the study, there is a negative relationship between diversification and enterprise performance (rate of return on common stockholders' equity). In order to improve the performance, the listed hydropower companies should operate in a simply-structured but highly efficient and low-consumption operation mode. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84870168788	Shape-controlled synthesis of pbs nanocrystals via a simple one-step process	A one-step colloidal process was adopted to prepare face-centered-cubic PbS nanocrystals with different shapes such as octahedral, starlike, cubic, truncated octahedral, and truncated cubic. The features of this approach avoid the presynthesis of any organometallic precursor and the injection of a toxic phosphine agent. A layered intermediate compound (lead thiolate) forms in the initial stage of the reaction, which effectively acts as the precursor to decompose into the PbS nanocrystals. The size and shape of the PbS nanocrystals can be easily controlled by varying the reaction time, the reactant concentrations, the reaction temperatures, and the amount of surfactants. In particular, additional surfactants other than dodecanethiol, such as oleylamine, oleic acid, and octadecene, play an important role in the shape control of the products. The possible formation mechanism for the PbS nanocrystals with various shapes is presented on the basis of the different growth directions of the nanocrystals with the assistance of the different surfactants. This method provides a facile, low-cost, highly reproducible process for the synthesis of PbS nanocrystals that may have potential applications in the fabrication of photovoltaic devices and photodetectors. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

The initial concentrations of ascorbic acid (AA), CTAB, and tetrachloroaurate trihydrate, as well as the amount of Pichia pastoris cells (PPCs), were optimized for the formation of AuNWs. For the formation of AuNWs, Au(III) ions were initially bound by the PPCs and then reduced by AA to produce Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) via preferential nucleation. The linear fusion of these AuNPs influenced by CTAB resulted in the formation of growing AuNWs, whereas the secondary nucleation beyond the PPCs produced small AuNPs that were subsequently consumed through Ostwald ripening during the aging of AuNWs. These AuNW/PPCs composites could be effectively used as surface-enhanced Raman scattering substrates for the detection of rhodamine 6G. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84872697205	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A physically interacts with human telomerase reverse transcriptase hTERT and regulates its subcellular distribution	Telomerase plays fundamental roles in bypassing cellular aging and promoting cancer progression by maintaining telomere homeostasis and telomere-independent activities. However, the molecular mechanisms by which telomerase provokes aging and cancer are far from being fully understood. In a search for proteins interacting with human telomerase reverse transcriptase hTERT by the yeast two-hybrid screen using hTERT T-motif as bait, we identified PP2A scaffolding subunit PR65 alpha isoform as an hTERT interacting partner. We showed that both PP2A catalytic subunit PP2AC and scaffolding subunit PR65 interacted with hTERT in vivo and in vitro and inhibited telomerase activity. In addition, we found that PP2A prevented the interaction of hTERT with 14-3-3θ signaling protein, an hTERT binding partner that is required for nuclear localization of hTERT. Activation of PP2A by overexpression of PP2AC or PR65 led to cytoplasmic accumulation of hTERT, which was reversed by treatment with PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid. Together, these observations suggest that PP2A regulates hTERT subcellular localization, in addition to its inhibitory effects on telomerase activity. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84875132550	PTEN suppresses the oncogenic function of AIB1 through decreasing its protein stability via mechanism involving Fbw7 alpha	Background: Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a phosphatase having both protein and lipid phosphatase activities, and is known to antagonize the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway, resulting in tumor suppression. PTEN is also known to play a role in the regulation of numerous transcription factors. Amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1) is a transcriptional coactivator that mediates the transcriptional activities of nuclear receptors and other transcription factors. The present study investigated how PTEN may regulate AIB1, which is amplified and/or overexpressed in many human carcinomas, including breast cancers.Results: PTEN interacted with AIB1 via its phophatase domain and regulated the transcriptional activity of AIB1 by enhancing the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of AIB1. This process did not appear to require the phosphatase activity of PTEN, but instead, involved the interaction between PTEN and F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 alpha (Fbw7α), the E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the ubiquitination of AIB1. PTEN interacted with Fbw7α via its C2 domain, thereby acting as a bridge between AIB1 and Fbw7α, and this led to enhanced degradation of AIB1, which eventually accounted for its decreased transcriptional activity. At the cell level, knockdown of PTEN in MCF-7 cells promoted cell proliferation. However when AIB1 was also knocked down, knockdown of PTEN had no effect on cell proliferation.Conclusions: PTEN might act as a negative regulator of AIB1 whereby the association of PTEN with both AIB1 and Fbw7α could lead to the downregulation of AIB1 transcriptional activity, with the consequence of regulating the oncogenic function of AIB1. © 2013 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84876214253	A Novel Multiplex Tetra-Primer ARMS-PCR for the Simultaneous Genotyping of Six Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Associated with Female Cancers	Background:The tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system PCR (T-ARMS-PCR) is a fast and economical means of assaying SNP's, requiring only PCR amplification and subsequent electrophoresis for the determination of genotypes. To improve the throughput and efficiency of T-ARMS-PCR, we combined T-ARMS-PCR with a chimeric primer-based temperature switch PCR (TSP) strategy, and used capillary electrophoresis (CE) for amplicon separation and identification. We assessed this process in the simultaneous genotyping of four breast cancer-and two cervical cancer risk-related SNPs.Methods:A total of 24 T-ARMS-PCR primers, each 5′-tagged with a universal sequence and a pair of universal primers, were pooled together to amplify the 12 target alleles of 6 SNPs in 186 control female blood samples. Direct sequencing of all samples was also performed to assess the accuracy of this method.Results:Of the 186 samples, as many as 11 amplicons can be produced in one single PCR and separated by CE. Genotyping results of the multiplex T-ARMS-PCR were in complete agreement with direct sequencing of all samples.Conclusions:This novel multiplex T-ARMS-PCR method is the first reported method allowing one to genotype six SNPs in a single reaction with no post-PCR treatment other than electrophoresis. This method is reliable, fast, and easy to perform. © 2013 Zhang et al.

The miscibility and morphology of the films were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The surface hydrophobicity and the thermal properties of the composite films were examined by contact angle (CA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. The results showed strong hydrogen bonding interactions and molecular miscibility between the two polymers. A dimerization reaction of SbQ pendant groups in PVA-SbQ chains induced by UV led to the crosslinking of the composite film. The film displayed enhanced tensile strength and slightly weakened elongation at break after being photo-crosslinked. Such film may be a promising material for food or drug packaging applications. © Smithers Rapra Technology, 2013.

84877611835	DDRGK1 Regulates NF-κB Activity by Modulating IκBα Stability	NF-κB is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that regulates a large number of genes in response to diverse physiological and pathological stimuli. The regulation of the transcriptional activity of NF-κB is often dependent on its interaction with IκBα. Proteins that bind to IκBα are critical regulators of NF-κB activity. DDRGK1 is a member of the DDRGK domain-containing protein family with unknown function. In this study, we showed that the depletion of DDRGK1 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion. Microarray analysis indicated that the expression of NF-κB target genes showed the most significant decrease after depleting of DDRGK1, suggesting that DDRGK1 may play an important role in the NF-κB signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that DDRGK1 interacts with IκBα and regulates its stability, thereby regulates the NF-κB transcriptional activity. Our findings identify DDRGK1 as an important regulator of the NF-κB pathway. © 2013 Xi et al.

84878102513	cDNA-SCoT: A novel rapid method for analysis of gene differential expression in sugarcane and other plants	Gene expression analysis is extremely important in the field of agriculture. The correct analysis could provide theoretical and scientific references for wide-range genetic improvements in plants to increase crop production quality and quantity. To correctly analyze gene expressions, a high-performing, effective, and inexpensive gene expression method is needed. Throughout all previous relevant researches, many methods were created for the detection and analysis of differentially-expressed genes in plants. Although these methods are technologically advanced, each marker system has its own disadvantages when used for gene expression analysis. All these methods have been created in various laboratories for different application purposes. In addition, each method is highly influential to different crop species, technical expertise, available equipments, available research funding, etc. which are not always available. So, these methods are unsuitable for a pure gene expression analysis. To simplify the gene expression analysis without the outside influences of crop species differentiation, different technical skills and equipments, and limited funding, we developed a new method for gene differential expression in plants based on the start codon targeted polymorphism (SCoT) DNA Marker technique, called cDNA-SCoT. The cDNA-SCoT is advantageous compared to all other existing methods because it is relatively more efficient, faster, cheaper, simpler to operate, and the results can be easily reproduced. This method also does not require expensive machineries or complicated chemical mixtures to operate. Consequently, this newly created method was successfully tested on sugarcane genes through this study. We predict that, due to its beneficial qualities in differential gene analysis in comparison to other methods, the cDNA-SCoT would play a more important role in studying differentially expressed genes, finding new genes, investigating the molecular mechanism of resistance, and more.

In this study, we investigated the effect of the pro-peptide on the secretion of Streptomyces hygroscopicus TGase in Escherichia coli by modifying its pro-peptide. Four N-terminal amino acid residues (Tyr12, Asn27, Asn30, and Arg32) in the pro-peptide predicted to interact with TGase region through hydrogen bonds.

84878813709	AIB1 Cooperates with ERα to Promote Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition in Breast Cancer through SNAI1 Activation	Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) plays a major role in cancer metastasis. Several genes have been shown to play a role in EMT, and one of these is Amplified-in-breast cancer 1 (AIB1), which has oncogenic function and is known to be amplified in breast cancer. However, the role of AIB1 in EMT remains largely undefined at the molecular level. In this study, the effect of AIB1 overexpression on the EMT of the breast cancer cell line T47D was investigated. Overexpression of AIB1 disrupted the epithelial morphology of the cells. At the same time, the cells displayed a strong metastasis and reduced level of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. In contrast, knockdown of AIB1 in T47D cells increased cell-cell adhesion and produced weak metastasis, as well as a higher level of E-cadherin expression. We proposed that the regulation of EMT by AIB1 occurred through the action of the transcription factor SNAI1, and demonstrated that such interaction required the participation of ERα and the presence of ERα-binding site on SNAI1 promoter. The expression level of E-cadherin and the extent of cell migration and invasion in SNAI1-knocked down T47D cells that overexpressed AIB1 were similar to those of T47D cells that did not overexpress AIB1 and had no SNAI1 knockdown. Taken together, these results suggested that AIB1 exerted its effect on EMT through its interaction with ERα, which could directly bind to the ERα-binding site on the SNAI1 promoter, allowing the AIB1-ERα complex to promote the transcription of SNAI1 and eventually led to repression of E-cadherin expression, consistent with the loss of E-cadherin being a hallmark of EMT. © 2013 Wang et al.

This article describes an attempt to improve the flexibility of zein films by the addition of gliadin to the zein film-forming solution. The properties of zein-gliadin composite films, i.e., color, transparency, moisture content, water solubility, water vapor permeability, dynamic contact angle which in turn affected the mechanical property, water resistance and glass transition temperature of films were investigated. The contents of second structure were characterized via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), whereas morphology of films was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was observed that the addition of gliadin enhanced the strain at break of zein-gliadin composite films as a result of the increase in the content of α-helix, β-turn structures and decrease in the level of β-sheet structure. The water resistance of films decreased with the content of gliadin increasing. Morphology of composite films showed that gliadin and zein organized a homogeneous material.

84879978463	Implications of telomere-independent activities of telomerase reverse transcriptase in human cancer	Telomerase plays a pivotal role in the pathology of cancer by maintaining genome integrity, controlling cell proliferation, and regulating tissue homeostasis. Experimental data from genetically modified mice and human premature aging diseases clearly indicate that intact telomere function is crucial for cell proliferation and survival, whereas dysfunctional telomeres can lead to either cancer or aging pathologies, depending on the integrity of the cellular stress response pathways. The canonical function of telomerase reverse transcriptase is the synthesis of telomeric DNA repeats and the maintenance of telomere length. However, accumulating evidence indicates that telomerase reverse transcriptase may also exert some fundamental biological functions independently of its enzymatic activity in telomere maintenance. More recent studies have demonstrated that telomerase reverse transcriptase can act as a transcriptional modulator in the nucleus and exhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in the mitochondria. Telomerase activation may have both telomere-dependent and telomere-independent implications for tumor progression. Many excellent reviews have described critical roles of telomere and telomerase in human cancer; this minireview will focus on the role of telomerase in cancer progression, with a special emphasis on the nontelomeric function of telomerase. Telomerase plays a pivotal role in the pathology of cancer. The canonical function of telomerase is the synthesis of telomeric DNA repeats and the maintenance of telomere length. However, accumulating evidence indicates that telomerase reverse transcriptase has other functions beyond telomere maintenance. Thus, telomerase activation may have both telomere-dependent and telomere-independent implications for tumor progression. © 2013 The Authors Journal compilation © 2013 FEBS.

With an intended application in provincial Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention, in this study, we present a two-tube multiplex RT-PCR assay (two-tube assay) using automatic electrophoresis to simultaneously detect sixteen common respiratory viruses. The specificity and the sensitivity of the assay were tested. The assay could detect 20-200 copies per reaction when each viral type was assayed individually, 2000 copies with 9 premixed viral targets in the multiplexed assay in tube 1, and 200 copies with 8 premixed templates in tube 2. A total of 247 specimens were used to evaluate the two-tube assay, and the results were compared with those obtained from the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay. The discordant results were confirmed by sequencing or by the Seeplex RV15 ACE detection kit. There were no false positives, but six false negatives occurred with the two-tube assay.

In this study, a new RPM (RPM-IVDC1) that consisted of 224-bp detector tiles corresponding to 9 influenza A subtypes, 11 rhinoviruses, 28 enteroviruses and 38 other respiratory viruses was developed and optimized to provide individual and simultaneous detection sensitivities ranging from 15 to 750 genomic copies for 16 common respiratory pathogens. A total of 110 consecutive patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) admitted to 5 district general hospitals in Beijing during a 1-year period were assessed using the new assay. Among the children (under age 5) and adult patients (above age 18), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) were the most common etiological agents, respectively, which is consistent with reference assays. Atypical pathogens that may cause CAP-like illness, including rubella virus, measles virus, influenza type C virus, human herpesvirus (HHV) were also detected. The results show the capability of RPM-IVDC1 for the accurate detection and identification of multiple virus types, which may be of significant use in epidemic surveillance and outbreak investigations of atypical pathogens. © 2013 Shen et al.

84885598880	CLOCK is a substrate of SUMO and sumoylation of CLOCK upregulates the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor-α	Disruption of the circadian rhythm is now believed to associate with a number of hormone-related cancers, such as breast cancer, in which aberrant estrogen receptor-α (ERα) signaling is a major contributor. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of core clock proteins in cancer are still largely undefined. In this study, we showed that circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), a key circadian protein, can interact with ERα. Furthermore, this interaction was enhanced by estrogen. We also showed that CLOCK can be sumoylated and sumoylation of CLOCK, which is also stimulated by estrogen, had two consequences: (1) it increased the transcriptional activity of CLOCK; and (2) it increased the CLOCK-modulated transcriptional activity of ERα, as shown by increased transcription of cyclin D1. Sumoylation of CLOCK occurred at two lysine residues, K67 and K851. The enhancement of ERα transcriptional activity exerted by wild-type but not mutant (2K/2R) CLOCK in response to estrogen indicated that sumoylation of CLOCK may have an important role in estrogen-dependent signaling. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay conducted with breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D) demonstrated that sumoylation of CLOCK stimulated cell growth and increased the proportion of S phase cells in the cell cycle. The results of this study uncovered new insight into the connection between a major circadian protein and a major estrogen-dependent transcription factor, providing the basis for further research into the involvement of circadian proteins in breast cancer. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

In this study, we investigated the potential of fusion technique with SAPs to improve the thermal stability of lipoxygenase (LOX) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Six SAPs were individually fused to the N terminus of the LOX that resulted to the SAP-LOX fusions with approximately 2.3- to 4.5-fold enhanced thermal stability at 50 C. The specific activities of the SAP-LOX fusions were also increased by 1.0- to 2.8-fold as compared with the wild-type LOX. This is the first report on the improvement of the thermal stability and specific activity of an enzyme by the fused SAPs, suggesting a simple technique to improve the catalytic properties of the recombinant enzymes by fusion expression. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84886009612	MicroRNA-26a Inhibits Angiogenesis by Down-Regulating VEGFA through the PIK3C2α/Akt/HIF-1α Pathway in Hepatocellular Carcinoma	Background & Aims:microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to regulate angiogenesis by down-regulating the expression of pro-angiogenic or anti-angiogenic factors. The aims of this study were to investigate whether miR-26a inhibited angiogenesis by down-regulating vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and its clinical relevance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The expression of miR-26a was modified in HepG2 and HCCLM3 cell lines respectively, and a panel of angiogenic factors was measured by real-time PCR in the cells. A luciferase reporter assay was used to validate the target gene of miR-26a. Specific inhibitors of signal transduction pathway and siRNA approaches were used to explore the regulatory mechanism of miR-26a. Migration and tube forming assays were conducted to show the changes of angiogenesis induced by miR-26a and its target genes. Finally animal studies were used to further validate those findings.Results:Ectopic expression of miR-26a exhibited decreased levels of VEGFA in HepG2 cells. Migration and tube forming of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were decreased in the conditioned medium from ectopic expression of miR-26a in HepG2 cells compared to control HepG2 cells. The pro-angiogenic effects of the conditioned medium of HepG2 cells on HUVECs were specifically decreased by LY294002, YC-1, and bevacizumab. Integrated analysis disclosed PIK3C2α as a downstream target gene of miR-26a. Ectopic expression of miR-26a suppressed ectopic and orthotopic tumor growth and vascularity in nude mice. The results in HCCLM3 were consistent with those in HepG2. miR-26a expression was inversely correlated with VEGFA expression in HCC patients.Conclusions:miR-26a modulated angiogenesis of HCC through the PIK3C2α/Akt/HIF-1α/VEGFA pathway. The expression of VEGFA was inversely correlated with miR-26a expression in HCC tumors. © 2013 Sun et al.

84886414012	Angelica sinensis polysaccharide nanoparticles as novel non-viral carriers for gene delivery to mesenchymal stem cells	This study centers on the use of a nanoparticle based on the polysaccharide from Angelica sinensis (ASP) as an efficient and safe non-viral gene vector. After modification with branched low molecular weight polyethylenimine (1200 Da), the cationized ASP (cASP) was combined with the plasmid encoding transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) to form a spherical nano-scaled particle (i.e., cASP-pTGF-β1 nanoparticle). This nanoparticle was applied to transfect rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. As a result, nanoparticles (cASP/pDNA weight ratio 10:1) had the greatest transfection efficiency in both cells, which was significantly higher than those of Lipofectamine2000 and PEI (25 kDa). This was in agreement with the findings of the semi-quantitative RT-PCR and live cell imaging. These nanoparticles were also less toxic than Lipofectamine2000 and PEI (25 kDa). Therefore, cASP could be a potential candidate for a novel non-viral gene vector. From the Clinical Editor: These authors demonstrate the use of a nanoparticle-based efficient and safe non-viral gene vector delivery system via a spherical nanoparticle based on a polysaccharide from Angelica sinensis, with parameters superior to Lipofectamine2000. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84887041006	Human telomerase reverse transcriptase regulates MMP expression independently of telomerase activity via NF-κB-dependent transcription	Telomerase plays a pivotal role in the pathology of aging and cancer by controlling telomere length and integrity. However, accumulating evidence indicates that telomerase reverse transcriptase may have fundamental biological functions independent of its enzymatic activity in telomere maintenance. In this study, the ectopic expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and its catalytic mutant hTERT K626A induced cancer cell invasion accompanied by the up-regulation of the metalloproteinases (MMPs) MMP1, -3, -9, and -10. Both hTERT and hTERT K626A induced MMP9 mRNA expression and promoter activity in an NF-κB-dependent manner. hTERT and hTERT K626A also regulated the expression of several NF-κB target genes in cancer cell lines. Furthermore, both hTERT and hTERT K626A interacted with NF-κB p65 and increased NF-κB p65 nuclear accumulation and DNA binding. A mammalian 1-hybrid assay showed a functional interplay between hTERT and NF-κB p65 that may mediate NF-κB-dependent transcription activation in cells. Together, these data reveal a telomere-independent role for telomerase as a transcriptional modulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway and a possible contributor to cancer development and progression. © FASEB.

In this work, a novel cluster, [Fe<inf>6</inf>O <inf>2</inf>(OH)<inf>2</inf>(O<inf>2</inf>CC<inf>6</inf>H<inf>4</inf>SCH <inf>3</inf>)<inf>10</inf>(hep)<inf>2</inf>]·CH<inf>3</inf>CN· CH<inf>2</inf>Cl<inf>2</inf> (Fe<inf>6</inf>) has been constructed by coordinating an octahedral Fe(iii) ion with 4-mercaptobenzoate and hepH (hepH = 2-(2-hydroxyethyl) pyridine). The functionalized thiomethyl groups around the periphery of the Fe<inf>6</inf> cluster may provide binding sites for the surfaces of some specific materials, such as noble metals. Therefore, silver nanoparticle coated Fe<inf>6</inf> (Ag@Fe<inf>6</inf>) complexes have been prepared by spontaneous self-assembly reactions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images show that the Fe<inf>6</inf> cluster layer is formed on the surface of the silver nanoparticles and the diameter of the Fe<inf>6</inf> cluster is about 2 nm. In addition, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis spectroscopy, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and cyclic voltammetry of the Fe <inf>6</inf> and Ag@Fe<inf>6</inf> complexes were also investigated. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84892558088	Endoplasmic reticulum stress activates telomerase	Telomerase contributes to cell proliferation and survival through both telomere-dependent and telomere-independent mechanisms. In this report, we discovered that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress transiently activates the catalytic components of telomerase (TERT) expression in human cancer cell lines and murine primary neural cells. Importantly, we show that depletion of hTERT sensitizes cells to undergo apoptosis under ER stress, whereas increased hTERT expression reduces ER stress-induced cell death independent of catalytically active enzyme or DNA damage signaling. Our findings establish a functional link between ER stress and telomerase, both of which have important implications in the pathologies associated with aging and cancer. © 2013 The Authors.

84892585679	Improvement of transglutaminase production by extending differentiation phase of Streptomyces hygroscopicus: Mechanism and application	Streptomyces transglutaminase (TGase) is an important industrial enzyme that catalyzes cross-linking of proteins. It is secreted as a zymogene and then is activated by proteases under physiological conditions. Although the activation process of TGase has been well investigated, the physiological function of TGase in Streptomyces has not been revealed. In this study, physiological function of TGase from Streptomyces hygroscopicus was found to be involved in differentiation by construction of a TGase gene interruption mutation strain (δtg). The mutant δtg showed an absence of differentiation compared with the parent strain. Furthermore, the production of TGase was found to be increased with the extending growth arrest phase of mycelium in submerged cultures. Thus, to enhance yield of TGase, the mycelium differentiation of Streptomyces was regulated via low temperature stress in a 3-L stirredtank fermenter. The production of TGase increased by 39 % through extending the growth arrest phase for 4 h. This study found that TGase is involved in Streptomyces differentiation and proposed an approach to improve TGase production by regulation of mycelium differentiation in submerged cultures. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

84893345584	Telomerase reverse transcriptase in the regulation of gene expression	Telomerase plays a pivotal role in the pathology of aging and cancer by maintaining genome integrity, controlling cell proliferation, and regulating tissue homeostasis. Telomerase is essentially composed of an RNA component, Telomerase RNA or TERC, which serves as a template for telomeric DNA synthesis, and a catalytic subunit, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). The canonical function of TERT is the synthesis of telomeric DNA repeats, and the maintenance of telomere length. However, accumulating evidence indicates that TERT may also have some fundamental functions that are independent of its enzymatic activity. Among these telomere-independent activities of hTERT, the role of hTERT in gene transcription has been investigated in detail. Transcriptional regulation is a fundamental process in biological systems. Several studies have shown a direct involvement of hTERT in gene transcription. This mini-review will focus on the role of hTERT in gene transcription regulation, and discuss its possible mechanisms. © 2014 by the The Korean Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

84894593550	A glucose-based diblock copolymer: Synthesis, characterization and its injectable/temperature-sensitive behaviors	To be more biocompatible, poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogel, as a typical temperaturesensitive hydrogel, is expected to be linked with other materials of excellent biocompatibility. For this propose, poly(Nisopropyl acrylamide)-block-poly(3-O-allyl-α-D-glucose) (PNIPAM-b-POAG), a new diblock copolymer, was successfully synthesized from N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM) and 3-O-allyl-1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropynylene-α-D-glucose (OAIG) via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in the presence of cumyl dithiobenzoate (CDB). PNIPAM-b-POAG was characterized byFourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the copolymer was 0.045 mg/ml measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. The copolymer solution exhibited a reversible sol-gel phase transitions with the increase or decrease of temperature. An in situ gel formed rapidly after subcutaneously injecting the copolymer solution into a Sprague Dawley (SD) rat, which indicated the copolymer has a good injectable property. The in vitro release result showed that methylene blue (MB) as a model was sustainably released by the temperature-sensitive PNIPAM-b-POAG diblock copolymer at 37 °C within 120 h. The copolymer showed no apparent cytotoxicity on L929 cells by 3-(4,5- Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The novel temperature-sensitive hydrogel is a promising candidate for drug delivery. © Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA) 2014.

84894235175	miR-127 regulates cell proliferation and senescence by targeting BCL6	Cellular senescence occurs as a response to extracellular and intracellular stresses and contributes to aging and age-related pathologies. Emerging evidence suggests that cellular senescence also acts as a potent tumor suppression mechanism that prevents the oncogenic transformation of primary human cells. Recent reports have indicated that miRNAsact as key modulators of cellular senescence by targeting critical regulators of the senescence pathways. We previously reported that miR-127 is up-regulated in senescent fibroblasts. In this report, we identified miR-127 as a novel regulator of cellular senescence that directly targets BCL6. We further showed that miR-127 is down-regulated in breast cancer tissuesand that this down-regulation is associated with up-regulation of BCL6. Over-expression of miR-127 or depletion of BCL6 inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation. Our data suggest that miR-127 may function as a tumor suppressor that modulates the oncogene BCL6. © 2013 Chen et al.

84896329831	Increased polymerase I and transcript release factor (Cavin-1) expression attenuates platelet-derived growth factor receptor signalling in senescent human fibroblasts	Summary: Previously, we showed that the essential caveolar component polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF) was upregulated and promoted caveolae formation in senescent cells. In addition, we found that overexpression of PTRF increased the number of caveolae and induced cellular senescence. Unresponsiveness to growth factor is one of the fundamental characteristics of senescent cells, although normal levels of receptors and downstream signalling molecules are present in senescent cells. Herein, we investigated the role of PTRF in the regulation of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signalling in young and senescent cells. We first confirmed that PTRF was upregulated in senescent human fibroblasts and aged mouse tissues. We then examined the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in young and senescent cells after PDGF stimulation. Our results show that expression of PDGF receptors (PDGFRs) was not altered during cellular senescence. Interestingly, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was induced upon PDGF stimulation of young, replicating cells but not senescent cells. Induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was impaired in senescent cells and PTRF-overexpressing presenescent cells. Furthermore, our results show that PTRF interacts with PDGFRs and this interaction is increased in senescent cells. These results suggest that the unresponsiveness of senescent fibroblasts to PDGF stimulation may be due to increased levels of PTRF and the formation of caveolae, which, in turn sequester growth receptors, such as PDGFR and its signalling molecules. © 2014 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84906053114	Improved production of α-ketoglutaric acid (α-KG) by a Bacillus subtilis whole-cell biocatalyst via engineering of l-amino acid deaminase and deletion of the α-KG utilization pathway	We previously developed a novel one-step biotransformation process for the production of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) from l-glutamic acid by a Bacillus subtilis whole-cell biocatalyst expressing an l-amino acid deaminase (pm1) of Proteus mirabilis. However, the biotransformation efficiency of this process was low owing to low substrate specificity and high α-KG degradation. In this study, we further improved α-KG production by protein engineering P. mirabilis pm1 and deleting the B. subtilis α-KG degradation pathway. We first performed three rounds of error-prone polymerase chain reaction and identified mutations at six sites (F110, A255, E349, R228, T249, and I352) that influence catalytic efficiency. We then performed site-saturation mutagenesis at these sites, and the mutant F110I/A255T/E349D/R228C/T249S/I352A increased the biotransformation ratio of l-glutamic acid from 31% to 83.25% and the α-KG titer from 4.65g/L to 10.08g/L. Next, the reaction kinetics and biochemical properties of the mutant were analyzed. The Michaelis constant for l-glutamic acid decreased from 49.21mM to 23.58mM, and the maximum rate of α-KG production increased from 22.82μMmin

84907482964	Cellular microRNAs and picornaviral infections	microRNAs (miRNAs) are a subtype of short, endogenous, and non-coding RNAs, which post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. The miRNA-mediated gene silencing mechanism is involved in a wide spectrum of biological processes, such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses. Picornaviridae is a large family of RNA viruses, which includes a number of causative agents of many human and animal diseases viz., poliovirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Accumulated evidences have demonstrated that replication of picornaviruses can be regulated by miRNAs and picornaviral infections can alter the expression of cellular miRNAs. Herein, we outline the intricate interactions between miRNAs and picornaviral infections.

The as-obtained products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption experimentation and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The effects of the reaction conditions on the morphology and crystallinity of the products were studied, as well as the amount of l-Asp, reaction time and reaction temperature. As the chelating agent and shape modifier, l-Asp plays a key role in the crystal growth of the yolk-shell ZnWO<inf>4</inf> microspheres. A possible formation mechanism for the yolk-shell microspheres is proposed. The photocatalytic properties of the yolk-shell ZnWO<inf>4</inf> microspheres were investigated by the decomposition of Rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) under UV light irradiation and the results show that they have excellent photocatalytic activities. Furthermore, the obtained yolk-shell ZnWO<inf>4</inf> microspheres are chemically stable and the efficiency remained almost the same after being recycled five times, suggesting that the yolk-shell ZnWO<inf>4</inf> microspheres are promising photocatalysts for practical applications.

84912119987	Interface instabilities and chaotic rheological responses in binary polymer mixtures under shear flow	A unified model by combining the Rolie-Poly constitutive model and the Flory-Huggins mixing free energy functional through a two fluid approach is presented for studying flow-induced phase separation in polymer mixtures. It is numerically solved in two-dimensional flow with monotonic and non-monotonic constitutive behaviour. The results are analyzed and show that this model can capture the essential dynamic features of viscoelastic phase separation reported in literature. The steady-state shear-banding and interface instabilities are reproduced. In the case with a non-monotonic constitutive behaviour, It is observed that the band structures are strongly unstable both in time and in space. The correlations between the microstructure evolution and chaotic rheological responses have been identified. A vortex structure emerges within the central band. Numerical results obtained from this study suggest that the dynamic features of rheochaos can be captured by the proposed model without introducing extra parameters.

This study developed an environment friendly process for KMTB production from L-methionine by an Escherichia coli whole-cell biocatalyst expressing an engineered L-amino acid deaminase (L-AAD) from Proteus vulgaris. We first overexpressed the P. vulgaris L-AAD in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and further optimized the whole-cell transformation process.

84922573935	Roles of M cells in infection and mucosal vaccines	The mucosal immune system plays a crucial part in the control of infection. Exposure of humans and animals to potential pathogens generally occurs through mucosal surfaces, thus, strategies that target the mucosa seem rational and efficient vaccination measures. Vaccination through the mucosal immune system can induce effective systemic immune responses simultaneously with mucosal immunity compared with parenteral vaccination. M cells are capable of transporting luminal antigens to the underlying lymphoid tissues and can be exploited by pathogens as an entry portal to invade the host. Therefore, targeting M-cell-specific molecules might enhance antigen entry, initiate the immune response, and induce protection against mucosal pathogens. Here, we outline our understanding of the distribution and function of M cells, and summarize the advances in mucosal vaccine strategies that target M cells.
