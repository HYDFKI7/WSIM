84930483481	Prevalence of antisocial personality disorder among Chinese individuals receiving treatment for heroin dependence: a meta-analysis	Background: Studies from Western countries consistently report very high rates of comorbid Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) among individuals with heroin addiction, but the reported proportion of Chinese individuals with heroin addiction who have co-morbid ASPD varies widely, possibly because Chinese clinicians do not consider personality issues when treating substance abuse problems. Aim: Conduct a meta-analysis of studies that assessed the proportion of Chinese individuals with heroin dependence who have comorbid ASPD. Methods: We searched for relevant studies in both Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, Taiwan Electronic Periodical Services) and western databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycInfo). Two authors independently retrieved the literature, identified studies that met pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, assessed the quality of included studies, and extracted the data used in the analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using StatsDirect 3.0 and R software. Results: The search yielded 15 eligible studies with a total of 3692 individuals with heroin dependence. Only 2 of the studies were rated as high-quality studies. All studies were conducted in rehabilitation centers or hospitals. The pooled lifetime prevalence of ASPD in these subjects was 30% (95%CI: 23%-38%), but the heterogeneity of results across studies was great (I2=95%, p<0.001). Men had a higher prevalence than women (44% vs. 21%), and injection heroin users had higher prevalence than those who smoked heroin (44% vs. 27%). Studies that were methodologically stronger had higher reported prevalence of ASPD among heroin dependent individuals. Conclusions There are substantial methodological problems in the available literature about ASPD in Chinese individuals receiving treatment for heroin dependence, but we estimate that about one-third of them meet criteria for ASPD. Further work is needed to increase clinicians' awareness of this issue; to compare the pathogenesis, treatment responsiveness and recidivism of those with and without ASPD; and to develop and test targeted interventions for this difficult-to-treat subgroup of individuals with heroin dependence.

9144224226	Dementia with Lewy bodies	Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second commonest cause of neurodegenerative dementia in older people. It is part of the range of clinical presentations that share a neuritic pathology based on abnormal aggregation of the synaptic protein α-synuclein. DLB has many of the clinical and pathological characteristics of the dementia that occurs during the course of Parkinson's disease. Here we review the current state of scientific knowledge on DLB. Accurate identification of patients is important because they have specific symptoms, impairments, and functional disabilities that differ from those of other common types of dementia. Severe neuroleptic sensitivity reactions are associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors is well tolerated by most patients and substantially improves cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Clear guidance on the management of DLB is urgently needed. Virtually unrecognised 20 years ago, DLB could within this decade be one of the most treatable neurodegenerative disorders of late life.

8744242046	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hongkong in 2003: Stress and psychological impact among frontline healthcare workers	Background. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) posed an unprecedented threat and a great challenge to health professionals in Hong Kong. The study reported here aimed at investigating the origin of stress and psychological morbidity among frontline healthcare workers in response to this catastrophe. Method. Self-administered questionnaires were sent to frontline healthcare workers in three hospitals. The General Health Questionnaire was used to identify psychological distress. Sociodemographic and stress variables were entered into a logistic regression analysis to find out the variables associated with psychological morbidity. Results. The response rate was 40%. Sixty-eight per cent of participants reported a high level of stress. About 57% were found to have experienced psychological distress. The healthcare workers' psychological morbidity was best understood by the perceptions of personal vulnerability, stress and support in the workplace. Conclusion. These findings shed light on the need for hospital administrators to be aware of the extent and sources of stress and psychological distress among frontline healthcare workers during disease outbreak. © 2004 Cambridge University Press.

14644406232	A pilot study of associated factors of weight changes in community-dwelling patients with Alzheimer's disease	The objective of this investigation was to identify associated factors for weight changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The prospective study was conducted on 20 early AD, 25 late AD psychogeriatric outpatients all over 60 years of age with family caregiver(s), and 36 normal older people as control subjects. Body anthropometry was assessed in subjects including bioelectric impedance analysis and indirect calorimetry. Total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) was estimated by questionnaire. Three-day food records and neuropsychiatric inventory were recorded. Fasting blood was analyzed for plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF). All subjects were weighed again 6 months later. In this study the AD subjects were thinner, less physically active, but had greater caloric and protein intakes than the control subjects. The percentage weight change in the AD subjects correlated inversely with TDEE, body mass index, and plasma TNF concentration (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.40, -0.43, Spearman correlation coefficient -0.31, respectively). In conclusion, physically active AD subjects are at risk of weight loss and plasma TNF may play a role in this condition. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

14644414819	The association between promoter polymorphism of the interleukin-10 gene and Alzheimer's disease	The importance of the role of inflammation has been suggested in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that may modulate the progression of the disease through the inhibition of the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, three polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the IL-10 gene (-1082, -819 and -592) in 95 Chinese AD patients and 117 age-matched healthy Chinese subjects were investigated. We found that among the Chinese population, the A and C alleles at the -592 position are strongly linked to the T and C alleles at the -819 position, respectively. A strong association with AD was found for these two IL-10 polymorphisms, which are in complete linkage disequilibrium (-592C and -819C), and the odds ratio of AD is 4.03 (95% CI 1.23-13.23; p = 0.011). The functional significance of the IL-10 genotype was further supported by the significant association between plasma IL-10 concentrations and genotypes that were found in an independent sample of 160 healthy male volunteers. No interaction effect between the ApoE and IL-10 genotypes is found. Therefore, we concluded that the functional polymorphisms of the IL-10 gene act as a risk factor for AD. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

1642564412	Elderly suicide in Hong Kong - A case-controlled psychological autopsy study	Objective: To examine some of the risk factors for late life suicide in Hong Kong Chinese using a case-controlled psychological autopsy approach. Method: Informants of 70 subjects aged 60 or above who had committed suicide as well as a community sample of 100 elderly controls were interviewed. Subjects and controls were assessed for the presence of mental illness, history of suicide attempt and data on health care utilization. Results: Eighty-six per cent of suicide subjects suffered from a psychiatric problem before committing suicide, compared with 9% of control subjects. Among the psychiatric problems, major depression was the commonest diagnosis. Seventy-seven per cent of suicide subjects had consulted a doctor within 1 month of suicide. One-third of suicide subjects had a history of suicide attempt. Rates of current psychiatric diagnosis, rates of medical consultation and history of suicide attempt are all significantly higher in suicide subjects than controls. Conclusion: Our findings support the view that depressive disorders and a past history of suicide attempt are risk factors of late-life suicide in the Chinese population of Hong Kong, similar to findings in western studies. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2004.

20644436270	Executive function impairment in community elderly subjects with questionable dementia	Background: The neurocognitive profile of community-dwelling Chinese subjects with 'questionable' dementia was studied. Methods: One hundred and fifty-four ambulatory Chinese subjects were recruited from local social centers for the elderly. Each subject was examined using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), the Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE), the Chinese version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), the Category Verbal Fluency Test (CVFT), digit and visual span tests, and the Cambridge Neurological Inventory. The neurocognitive profile of nondemented subjects (CDR 0) was compared with that of subjects with 'questionable' dementia (CDR 0.5). Results: Subjects with 'questionable' dementia were older, and had lower educational levels and global cognitive assessment scores than the controls (CMMSE and ADAS-Cog; t tests, p < 0.001). In addition, they also had significantly lower scores in delayed recall, reverse span, verbal fluency tests and worse performance in complex motor tasks related to executive function (Mann-Whitney tests, p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that ADAS-Cog, CVFT, and reverse visual span were significant predictors for the CDR of 'questionable' dementia. Conclusion: Aside from memory impairment, executive function deficits were also present in subjects with 'questionable' dementia. To identify groups cognitively at risk for dementia, concomitant assessments of memory and executive function are suggested. Copyright © 2005 S. Karger AG.

1942438021	Modified Card Sorting Test Performance among Community Dwelling Elderly Chinese People	Objective: To examine the performance of Nelson's Modified Card Sorting Test in community dwelling elderly Chinese people. Patients and Methods: Nelson's Modified Card Sorting Test was administered to 95 healthy elderly Chinese people. Relationships between the Modified Card Sorting Test performance and demographic characteristics were evaluated. Results: Most people (86.3%) were unable to complete 6 categories, and many of them made perseverative errors. Approximately 30% made more than 50% perseverative errors. Age, educational level, and gender significantly affected Modified Card Sorting Test performances, with education demonstrating the largest effect on performance. Conclusion: These findings suggest that demographic factors appear to exert a significant impact on Modified Card Sorting Test performances in elderly people, so these should be taken into consideration during interpretation of clinical assessments. For the effective use of the Modified Card Sorting Test in clinical settings, further studies of specific clinical populations are required to develop normative data for elderly Chinese people.

0030659828	REM sleep behaviour disorder: An overview	REM sleep behaviour disorder (RSBD) is a recently described parasomnia characterised by a history of excessive nocturnal motor activity and absence of muscle atonia during REM sleep. Only limited literature is available on this condition. The exact prevalence is unclear, but recent studies suggest it might not be an uncommon condition. The elderly are more often affected and there is a male preponderance. While transient RSBD can be seen after taking certain drugs or during drug withdrawal, the chronic type is usually idiopathic or associated with an underlying degenerative neurological condition. It can result in considerable distress and/or serious injury to the patients or their bed partners. Differential diagnoses include sleep-walking, night terrors, nightmares, nocturnal seizures, obstructive sleep apnoea, post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative states and nocturnal confusional states. The dramatic response to clonazepam highlights the importance of recognition and appropriate treatment of this sleep disorder.

0030827839	The modified fuld verbal fluency test: A validation study in Hong Kong	Recent studies in the West have found that verbal fluency tests are useful in the detection of dementia. In this study, the Fuld Verbal Fluency Test (FVFT) was modified and tested for its usefulness as a screening instrument for differentiating demented from normal elderly Chinese in Hong Kong. Fifty-three normal and 56 demented subjects were administered the FVFT, the Cantonese version of the Mini. Mental State Examination (CMMSE), and the Chinese version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. In addition to bearing significant correlation with the CMMSE, the verbal fluency scores for all semantic categories (animals, fruits, vegetables) were found to produce significant differentiation between the normal and demented groups. However, test-retest reliability for the individual verbal fluency scores was shown to be unsatisfactory, and a composite measure was recommended for use in future screening on the grounds of its enhanced reliability.

0030920312	Screening for dementia: A preliminary study on the validity of the Chinese version of the Blessed-Roth dementia scale	Blessed-Roth Dementia Scale has been one of the most widely used rating scales in dementia. Previous studies indicated that this behavioral assessment scale is a useful tool for differentiating elderly subjects with no or minimal intellectual decline from those with cognitive deterioration. In the present study, the authors examined the validity of the Chinese version of the Blessed-Roth Dementia Scale (CDS) in Hong Kong. A total of 106 Chinese subjects were recruited from a social center, an old-age home, and psychogeriatric outpatient clinics. At a cutoff score of 3 of 4, the CDS achieved a sensitivity of 90.5% and specificity of 98.1% in differentiating demented from healthy control subjects. In the Chinese population studied, the scale was readily acceptable and considered to be an useful adjunct in screening of dementia.

0031783662	Clock-face drawing, reading and setting tests in the screening of dementia in Chinese elderly adults	Comprehensive neuropsychological batteries focus on the subtle cognitive deficits in dementia, but a brief screening instrument is also of immense practical value. As the clock-drawing test encompasses a number of cognitive domains frequently disturbed by the dementing process, it is considered to be a suitable screening instrument for the disorder. We documented the usefulness of a new scoring method of the clock-drawing test for screening of dementia in the elderly Chinese in Hong Kong. Fifty-three demented individuals and 53 healthy elderly controls were assessed. At a cutoff score of 3/4 , the sensitivity and specificity of the clock-drawing test in screening of dementia was 83% and 79%. With a composite test of clock reading and clock setting, the positive predictive value of the clock face test was 98%. This new scoring method of clock-drawing proved to be a valid measure for screening of dementia. It is applicable in non-English speaking populations and should be a useful adjunct for quick screening assessment of dementia.

0031890051	Hyponatremia associated with paroxetine	Hyponatremia is an uncommon but widely reported complication of selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and most of the case reports involve elderly patients. The presentation is usually that of SIADH, but the underlying mechanism leading to the syndrome is poorly understood. Since the use of SSRIs is becoming more popular among elderly depressed patients and because of the potentially serious consequence of hyponatremia, psychiatrists should be alert to the development of the complication and familiarize themselves with its diagnosis acid treatment. We report two elderly patients who were identified to have hyponatremia after the commencement of paroxetine. This illustrates the need for monitoring of plasma sodium level if a patient's clinical condition deteriorates. Other factors possibly related to the hyponatremia are discussed and a review of the diagnosis and management of SSRI-related hyponatremia is included.

0031954044	Prevalence of dementia in Chinese elderly in Hong Kong	This study examines the prevalence of dementia in elderly Chinese aged 70 years and older in Hong Kong using a two-phase design. In phase 1, 1,034 elderly were interviewed with the Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination. Those who scored below the cutoff points and a subsample of those with scores in the normal range were interviewed in phase 2 to identify those with dementia. The overall weighted prevalence of dementia in our subjects was 6.1 ± 0.7%, which is at the lower end of the range of rates reported in whites. Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounted for 64.6% and vascular dementia, 29.3%. Our results, together with previous studies in Chinese populations, suggest that the rates of AD in Chinese are low compared with those in whites. Substantial differences are possible in the epidemiology of dementia across cultures related to interactions of genetic and environmental factors.

0032496078	Low density lipoprotein receptor related protein gene exon 3 polymorphism association with Alzheimer's disease in Chinese	Since apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) is the major genetic risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), proteins that interact with apoE might be involved in AD pathogenesis. Low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP) is an apoE receptor in the brain. In exon 3 of the LRP gene a polymorphism was found to be underrepresented in AD compared to normal Caucasian subjects (N). We examined this polymorphism in Chinese AD and N subjects. The polymorphism frequency in N was roughly half that reported for Caucasians. Compared to N, the frequency was significantly decreased in pathologically diagnosed, but not in clinically diagnosed AD patients. Thus, the role of the LRP exon 3 polymorphism in AD has now been demonstrated in two ethnic groups, suggesting the importance of LRP in AD pathogenesis.

0032559197	No association detected between very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL-R) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Hong Kong Chinese	The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a risk factor in late- onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a receptor for ApoE, very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) might be involved in AD pathogenesis. A Japanese study [Okuizimi, K., et al., Nature Genet., 11 (1995) 207-209] has shown an increased 5 and decreased 8 CGG-repeat allele frequency in the 5' untranslated region of VLDLR in Japanese AD versus normal controls (N). Subsequent studies in Caucasian Americans failed to duplicate the result. We examined this polymorphism in pathologically- or clinically-diagnosed Chinese late-onset AD. Our data did not show a significant increase in the 5 CGG- repeat in AD, thus suggesting no association to VLDLR. However, our data did show that the allele frequencies for each CGG-repeat were similar in both Chinese and Japanese.

25444450309	Subjective memory complaints in Chinese subjects with mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease	Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transitional state between normal aging and dementia. However, there is inconsistent opinion as to the validity of subjective memory complaints as a criterion for diagnosis. Objective: This study aimed to examine the potential significance of applying a short memory questionnaire in the assessment of Chinese subjects with MCI and early dementia. Methods: Three hundred and six ambulatory Chinese subjects were recruited. Each participant completed a short memory questionnaire. They were also assessed with the Chinese versions of the mini-mental state examination (CMMSE), Alzheimer's disease assessment scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), category verbal fluency test (CVFT) and span tests. Severity of cognitive impairment was evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR); subjects with CDR 0.5 were further classified into MCI not demented (MCIND) and MCI possible incipient dementia (MCIID) depending on the subscale scores of CDR. Results: An increasing frequency of memory complaints with increasing CDR was observed (Kruskal Wallis test, chi square = 21.29, df 3, p < 0.001). With a cutoff of 3 or more memory complaints, the memory questionnaire demonstrated a sensitivity of 65.3% and 70.4% in identifying subjects with incipient and early dementia respectively. Significant associations between memory complaints and most cognitive test performance were found (Spearman's correlations, p < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis revealed that educational level, the memory questionnaire, ADAS-Cog total and delayed recall scores were significant predictors of MCIID status. Conclusions: The findings suggested that a short memory questionnaire is useful in the screening of MCI, particularly in subjects who already present with subtle functioning disturbances. Subjective memory complaints were significant correlated with objective performance of memory functions, reflecting the usefulness of memory complaints in the assessment of MCI.

27544447649	Life strain and psychological distress of older women and older men in Hong Kong	This study examined the life strain and psychological distress among a group of older adults (N = 1034, 51.2% female) in Hong Kong. Data were collected through individual interviews in which a standardized questionnaire was administered. The results indicated that older women had more somatic complaints and poorer self-rated health. Family network and interdependent relationships were significantly poorer among the older women than in the older men. Women were also found to experience a higher level of psychological distress (as measured by GDS-15 and GHQ-12) than did men. Perceived financial strain and poor physical health had similar direct effect on the psychological distress of both older women and older men. In contrast to Western findings, a poor family network was observed to exert a greater direct effect on psychological distress than an inadequate social network of friends. Generally, a good social network was found to mitigate the negative impact of life strain factors among older men, but not among older women. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

2642708354	Assessing psychological well-being of the old-old: A comparative study of GDS-15 and GHQ-12	The purpose of this study was to compare two short measures, viz., the 15-item version of Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) in the assessment of the psychological well-being of the old-old in Hong Kong. The sample (N = 1,034) consisted of 504 males and 530 females aged 70 or above. Results of the study indicated that both measures were of satisfactory reliability (Cronbach alpha = .82 and .75 respectively). Significant and meaningful relationships of GDS-15 and GHQ-12 with social support, physical health, and financial status were established, which provided evidence for the construct validity of the two measures. The findings suggested further that GDS-15 was a more sensitive outcome measure than GHQ-12.

27744600761	Validation of the Chinese version of the Zarit Burden Interview	Objective: To validate the Chinese version of the Zarit Burden Interview as an instrument for assessing the stress experienced by carers of elderly patients with dementia. Patients and Methods: The Zarit Burden Interview was first translated into Chinese and then back-translated into English for comparison. Forty Chinese patients with mild to moderate dementia were recruited from 2 psychiatric clinics in Hong Kong. The Zarit Burden Interview, General Health Questionnaire, and Caregiver Activity Survey were completed by the patients' carers. Two raters rated another 16 carers separately for assessment of inter-rater reliability. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.99 and the split half correlation coefficient was 0.81, suggesting a high inter-rater reliability and internal consistency. The correlation between the Zarit Burden Interview and the General Health Questionnaire was 0.59 (p < 0.001), and the correlation between the Zarit Burden Interview and the Caregiver Activity Survey was 0.57 (p < 0.001), suggesting high conceptual validity. Conclusion: The Chinese version of the Zarit Burden Interview is a valid and reliable tool to evaluate the stress experienced by carers of elderly people with dementia in Hong Kong. © 2005 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists.

30844474182	Association between mind-body and cardiovascular exercises and memory in older adults	OBJECTIVES: To compare the memory function of older adults who regularly practiced mind-body (MB) or cardiovascular (CV) exercises with that of those who did not engage in regular exercise. Older adults who engaged in both types of exercise were also included to examine the combined effects. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study between 2002 and 2003. SETTING: Older adults from a local community in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty adults aged 56 and older. MEASUREMENTS: The Hong Kong List Learning Test was used to assess the memory of all participants. It is a clinically validated Chinese verbal-memory test that measures various aspects of memory processing, including learning, retention, and retrieval abilities. MB and CV exercises were defined using three dimensions: motion speed, emphasis on relaxing the mind, and conscious control of movement. RESULTS: Older adults who practiced MB or CV exercises demonstrated a similar level of memory function, and their learning and memory was better than that of individuals who did not exercise regularly. Those who practiced both types of exercises outperformed all other groups, even after corrected for the total hours of exercise. Although memory change across age was found in older adults who did not exercise, this trend was not observed in individuals who practiced MB exercises. CONCLUSION: Practicing both MB and CV exercises appears to have a combined effect that might help to preserve memory in older adults. In addition, MB exercises may be considered as an alternative training for older adults who cannot practice strenuous physical exercise. © 2005 by the American Geriatrics Society.

33645777978	Apolipoprotein epsilon-4 allele and the two-year progression of cognitive function in Chinese subjects with late-onset Alzheimer's disease	Background: Although the significance of apolipoprotein E4 (Apo E4) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been well established in Caucasian populations, its role in determining the rate of cognitive decline in other ethnic groups has yet to be determined. This study examined the two-year progression of cognitive decline and its association with Apo E4 allelic status in a group of Chinese elderly subjects with AD. Method: One hundred and four Chinese subjects with mild and moderate AD as assessed by the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR1 and 2) were followed up at a mean (SD) duration of 22.53 (5.21) months. The rate of cognitive decline and its association with Apo E4 allelic status was evaluated. Results: At follow-up, 74 (73 percent) subjects were reassessed. Forty-nine remained stable at the same CDR and 25 had deteriorated. The mean (SD) deterioration in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was 2.52 (4.38) and in the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) was 9.03 (14.98) (paired t-test, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the baseline MMSE and DRS scores between the "stable," "deteriorated," or "deceased" groups. Mildly demented subjects with the Apo E4 allele were more likely to have deteriorated to a more severe CDR than subjects without the Apo E4 allele (Pearson χ

33645655021	Polymorphisms of the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) gene and the risk of Alzheimer's disease in a Chinese population	Background: An increasing number of studies have suggested a link between cholesterol metabolism and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which may be mediated by its effect on amyloid processing. Intracranial cholesterol is primarily eliminated into the bloodstream through conversion into 24-hydroxycholesterol by the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (encoded by the CYP46A1 gene). CYP46A1 is an essential gene modulating cholesterol metabolism in the brain. Method: To investigate whether polymorphisms in the CYP46A1 gene modulate the risk of AD, we studied four common polymorphisms (IVS1-192, IVS2-150, IVS3-128 and IVS4-122) in 182 Chinese AD patients and 179 age-matched healthy Chinese subjects. Results and conclusion: We found that the IVS3-128 polymorphism was associated with the risk of AD (p < 0.05). Subjects homozygous for the C alleles were protected from AD with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.53 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.98-2.37, p = 0.047]. However, another minor allele, IVS1-192 C, was more prevalent in the AD group and was associated with an increased risk. Haplotype analysis revealed that two of the eight common haplotypes formed by the four polymorphisms were rarely found in the AD group, suggesting a protective effect of these two haplotypes (GTCA and CCTA). The results supported the involvement of the CYP46A1 gene and cholesterol metabolism in the pathogenesis of AD. © 2006 International Psychogeriatric Association.

33744827671	IPA survey of brief cognitive screening instruments	Background and objectives: Cognitive screening is a "first step" in detecting dementia and other neuropsychiatric syndromes and hence represents an important public health and clinical initiative. A plethora of cognitive screening instruments has been advocated in recent years, but the extent to which these instruments are used or their effectiveness is not well known. An International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) survey was designed to determine which cognitive screening instruments were used most frequently by clinicians with special expertise in the neuropsychiatric aspects of old age and also to determine the ones considered most useful by these specialists. Method: Under the auspices of the IPA, the survey was mailed in the fall of 2004 to all IPA members as well as members of the American and Canadian Associations of Geriatric Psychiatry. The survey inquired about demographic information, the frequency of use of cognitive screening instruments, and the value attributed to the cognitive screening instruments. Participants also had an opportunity to provide written commentary. Results: A total of 334 completed surveys were processed. The majority of respondents were geriatric psychiatrists (58%). Of the 20 different instruments that were listed on the survey, only six were selected as "routinely" or "often used" by the survey respondents. These instruments in declining order were: (1) the Folstein Mini-mental State Examination; (2) the Clock Drawing Test; (3) Delayed Word Recall; (4) the Verbal Fluency Test; (5) Similarities; and (6) the Trail Making Test. "Effectiveness" and "ease of administration" were the test characteristics most highly predictive of frequency of use. Open-ended comments highlighted patient factors that continue to provide challenges, including ethnicity/culture, language, education/literacy, and sensory impairment. Respondents concluded that "no single test is adequate." Conclusions: Psychogeriatricians worldwide routinely use a relatively small number of brief cognitive screening instruments. Further evaluation is necessary as the need increases for cognitive screening guidelines that inform public health initiatives related to dementia and neuropsychiatric syndromes. © 2006 International Psychogeriatric Association.

33646798739	Association between soft neurological signs and clinical progression in Alzheimer's disease	Objective: Unlike cognitive function, clinical assessment of neurological deficits in Alzheimer's disease has received limited attention. This study aimed to determine the association between soft neurological signs and rate of clinical progression in Chinese people with Alzheimer's disease. Patients and Methods: 104 Chinese patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease were followed up for an average of 22.5 months (SD, 5.2 months). Soft neurological signs were evaluated with the Cambridge Neurological Inventory. Outcome was determined by deterioration in Clinical Dementia Rating and mortality. Results: Motor coordination, sensory integration, and failure of suppression signs were more prevalent in participants with Alzheimer's disease than in controls without dementia (p < 0.001) and the scores for these signs were significantly correlated with most cognitive function tests (p < 0.05). Patients with stable Clinical Dementia Rating scores at follow-up had lower scores for parkinsonian signs (p < 0.005) than those who had died during the follow-up period. Conclusions: The findings suggest that cortical soft neurological signs such as motor coordination and sensory integration, which were highly associated with cognitive performance in patients with Alzheimer's disease, represent overlapping clinical dimensions. The presence of subcortical extrapyramidal signs may signify poorer prognosis. © 2005 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists.

33746437522	Association between cognitive function, behavioral syndromes and two-year clinical outcome in Chinese subjects with late-onset Alzheimer's disease	Objective: To examine associations between behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), cognitive function and clinical deterioration over 2 years. Methods: One hundred and four Chinese subjects with late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD) who presented to psychogeriatric clinics were followed for an average of 22.5 months. BPSD subgroups were categorized by latent class analysis using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Comprehensive cognitive profiles were performed with the Mattis Dementia Scale, the Hong Kong List Learning Test (HKLLT) and the Category Verbal Fluency Test. Interactions between cognitive function and behavioral syndromes were evaluated. Potential predictors for clinical deterioration were computed with logistic regression analysis. Results: Three latent classes of subjects with similar behavioral syndromes were identified: Low BPSD (44%), Affective (32%) and Psychosis (24%) groups. Association between cognitive functions and BPSD was not significant. At follow-up, a higher proportion of subjects in the Affective (70%) and Low BPSD (49%) groups remained stable at the same Clinical Dementia Rating. Baseline scores in the "recognition" test of the HKLLT and age were significant predictors for "deceased" status at 2-year follow-up. Conclusion: The lack of association between behavioral syndromes and cognitive function suggests that these relatively independent dimensions of dementia should be examined individually for different prognostic significance. © 2006 International Psychogeriatric Association.

33746906715	Phenotype-genotype relationship and clinical effects of citalopram in Chinese patients	Although the relationship of CYP2C19 polymorphism to citalopram disposition has been studied in healthy subject, this relationship in combination with dynamic effects (clinical adverse effect of citalopram) has not been well studied in patients. We carried out the present study to investigate the CYP2C19 genotype-phenotype relationship and potentially relate such relationship to the clinical effect (specifically adverse effects) of citalopram in Chinese patients who are known to have relatively high prevalence of poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2C19. Fifty-three Chinese adult patients were recruited. One to 2 blood samples at 4 to 24 hours postdose were collected after a minimum of 2 weeks of citalopram administration. The CYP2C19 genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, and the plasma concentrations of citalopram and desmethylcitalopram were determined by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. The clinical adverse effects associated with citalopram were assessed according to Toronto Side Effects Scale (TSES). A population pharmacokinetic model was used to analyze the citalopram concentrations. Among 53 patients, 21 were homozygous extensive metabolizers (EMs) (CYP2C19*1/*1), 25 heterozygous EMs (CYP2C19*1/*2 or *1/*3), and 7 PMs (CYP2C19*2/ *2 or *2/*3 or *3/*3). The metabolic ratios (plasma concentration of desmethylcitalopram to citalopram) were found to be 0.20 ± 0.07, 0.15 ± 0.05, and 0.07 ± 0.03 in the homozygous EMs, heterozygous EMs, and PMs, respectively (P < 0.001, 1-way analysis of variance). On the basis of the results from our population pharmacokinetic modeling analysis, the citalopram oral clearances in the PMs were 42.9% and 33.3% (both P < 0.05) lower compared with the homozygous and heterozygous EMs, respectively. Statistically significant correlation was observed between the oral clearance and TSES scores in individual patients (r

33749091292	Genetic analysis of CYP2D6 locus of Hong Kong Chinese psychiatric patients	The genetically determined polymorphism of debrisoquine hydroxylase (cytochrome P4502D6, CYP2D6) shows marked interethnic differences due to the different distribution of the alleles of the CYP2D6 gene in different populations. Differences are not only in the incidence of poor metabolizers (PM) of debrisoquone, but also in the enzyme activity within the extensive metabolizer (EM) phenotype. The distribution of the debrisoquine metabolic ratios (MR) is shifted towards higher values among Oriental EMs compared to Caucasian EMs due to the high prevalence of the CYP2D6*10 allele [nomenclature according to Daly et al., 1996] in this population [Wang et al., 1993]. The prevalence of the different alleles of the CYP2D6 gene may be different within different Oriental populations or in particular patient groups. The genotype of 54 patients with diagnosis of major depression according to DSM IV was assessed for the prevalence of the alleles CYP2D6*10, CYP2D6*4, and CYP2D6*8 (the prevalence of which in Chinese is not known). Mutation 2938C→T indicative of CYP2D6*2 (allele L) was also assessed in five patients homozygous for CYP2D6*10 and was found to be absent. Genotyping was performed according to published methods. The CYP2D6*8 and CYP2D6*4 alleles were absent in the present population studied as expected. The CYP2D6*10 allele frequency was 0.6 in the present study, similar to that found among Singaporean Chinese, higher than that found among the Japanese, Koreans, and Chinese living in Sweden (0.51), and lower than that among Taiwanese (0.7) [Wang et al., 1993; Yokota et al., 1993; Lee and Jeyaseelan, 1994; Roh et al., 1996]. Genotyping a healthy Hong Kong Chinese population and testing for other variants of the CYP2D6 gene is in progress. This is the first CYP2D6 genotyping study conducted on a Hong Kong Chinese population. It will contribute to previous data on differences among EMs of different Oriental origins.

33750160179	Subjective complaints and self-evaluation of memory test performancen in Questionable dementia	Background: The clinical significance of subjective memory complaints in elderly subjects has been an area of active research. In this study, we evaluated subjective complaints and self-evaluation of memory test performance in subjects with Questionable dementia (QD) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Ninety-two subjects (35 cognitively intact normal controls NC, 33 QD, and 24 mild AD) were assessed. Subjective memory complaints were evaluated using a memory inventory for the Chinese (MIC); objective assessment of awareness was assessed by the self-evaluation of own memory test performance. Cognitive function was assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), Category Verbal Fluency Test (CVFT) and Executive Interview (EXIT-25). Depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD). Results: The total number of subjective memory complaints (MI-tol) were significantly different between different subject groups (Kruskal Wallis test, χ

Methods: A combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches was adopted. The MIC was developed with focus group discussion and pilot testing. It has a patient and a caregiver version. A consecutive series of 79 new out-patients with the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorder Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria of probable and possible AD and 20 non-demented elderly subjects were recruited. Results: A high internal consistency was found, with Cronbach alpha of 0.89 for the patient version and 0.90 for the caregiver version of MIC. The inter-rater reliability was satisfactory. For validity assessment, the caregiver score of the MIC correlated significantly with cognitive score of the subject as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (r

33750447986	Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele is associated with vascular dementia	Background/Aims: The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) exon 4 polymorphism has been associated with vascular dementia (VaD) risk. Since not all studies confirm this finding, we explored this association in a case-control study. Methods: We genotyped ApoE in 144 VaD patients and 251 controls. Results: VaD patients were more likely than controls to have ApoE ε3/ε4 or ε4/ε4 genotypes: 23.6% versus 15.1%, odds ratio (OR) = 1.7, p = 0.036. This association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension and diabetes by multiple logistic regression: OR = 1.9, p = 0.030. The association of ε3/ε4 or ε4/ε4 genotypes with VaD was strong among people with hypertension (OR = 2.9, p = 0.007) or diabetes (OR = 6.5, p = 0.011). The association was absent among people without hypertension (OR = 1.1, p = 0.79) or diabetes (OR = 1.3, p = 0.43). Conclusion: This interaction with hypertension and diabetes should be examined in other studies to confirm or refute this observation. Copyright © 2006 S. Karger AG.

34248200571	Relevance of outcome measures in different cultural groups - Does one size fit all?	It is estimated that 24 million people currently have dementia and that two-thirds of them live in developing countries. However, most of the assessment instruments for dementia have originated in developed countries. This paper explores the relevance of outcome measures in clinical trials of dementia drugs in different cultural groups, particularly in developing countries. The challenges of assessing treatment benefits in dementia in such groups include linguistic and cultural diversity, as well as high illiteracy rates, lack of human resources and the time constraints in assessment of patients. This paper also highlights methodological issues in cross-cultural research of cognitive assessment. Improvement in neuropsychiatric outcomes may be of particular importance to people in non-Western cultures. Functional outcomes and global outcomes are potentially useful outcome measures, but more studies are required in various countries. The use of biological markers such as neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies may not be practical in developing countries due to their costs and acceptability respectively. More work is also needed in the area of quality of life measures in various countries. © 2007 International Psychogeriatric Association.

34249719346	Depression and apathy affect functioning in community active subjects with questionable dementia and mild Alzheimer's disease	Background: The relationships between apathy, depression and functional impairment in questionable dementia (QD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are complex. This study aimed to explore the interactions between severity of apathy, depression and functional performance; and to investigate the effects of apathy alone, depression alone and coexistence of apathy and depression on the functional performance in subjects with QD and AD. Methods: One hundred ninety-five subjects with QD and 96 subjects with mild AD were recruited. Apathy and depression were rated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and functional disability was measured using the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD). Results: Severity of apathy and depression symptoms were associated with poorer functional performance in QD and apathy was associated with poorer functional performance in AD. In QD, subjects with apathy, depression, or coexistence of apathy and depression had poorer functional performance than those with neither apathy nor depression. The coexistence of apathy and depression did not produce more severe functional disability than apathy alone or depression alone. In AD, subjects with apathy had poorer functional performance than those without apathy. Depression in the absence of apathy was not associated with more severe functional disability. Conclusion: Apathy and depression symptoms are common in the early course of AD. Apathy and deprssion had different effects on functional performances in the subjects with QD from those with AD.

34347401449	Characteristic profiles of instrumental activities of daily living in Chinese older persons with mild cognitive impairment	Increasing evidence suggests that performance of the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) can be impaired at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. Our study aimed at investigating the profiles of functional impairment in Chinese subjects with MCI. Subjects with MCI were categorized into single-domain amnestic MCI (a-MCI) (n = 54) and multiple-domain amnestic MCI (md-MCI) (n = 93) groups. Their functional scores of Disability Assessment of Dementia (DAD) were compared with those of cognitively normal elderly controls (NC) (n = 78) and those with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 85). Subjects with md-MCI had intermediate performance in IADL between the NC and those with mild AD. Subjects with a-MCI had functional scores similar to those of normal controls. Age, education, and global cognitive test scores were not associated with functional scores in MCI subjects. Our results demonstrated that Chinese older persons with md-MCI had impairment in IADL, as compared to NC and subjects with a-MCI. This finding suggests that assessment of IADL should be incorporated in the clinical evaluation of MCI. © 2007 Sage Publications.

35148888650	Studies from emerging countries: An encouraging development	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the findings of recent psychogeriatric research conducted in emerging countries. RECENT FINDINGS: During the review period there have been new reports on the prevalence, clinical characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of dementia in its various forms, epidemiological findings on depression, and psychological autopsy analyses of suicidal behaviors and psychiatric morbidities. New studies in social psychiatry have been conducted, especially on the trends of transgenerational support of the elderly and of interventions that may reduce psychiatric disease burdens and promote mental health in later life. SUMMARY: These research findings support a better understanding of the prevalence, nature, and underlying risk and protective factors of the major psychiatric morbidities in the studied regions. Further exploration of the epidemiological profile of mental disorders in rural areas, research on the direct and indirect costs of psychogeriatric conditions, and evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability of early detection programs, treatment and rehabilitation models are warranted. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

Patients and Methods: One hundred and fifty Chinese AD patients and 155 cognitively intact control subjects were recruited for the study. Genotypes of TNFR2+196, FAS-670, and FAS-1377 were investigated in this study by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Results: The TNFR2+196 TT genotype was more prevalent in the AD group than in the controls. However, no significant difference in genotypic and allelic frequencies between AD and control groups (p = 0.68) was observed. Conclusion: We suggested that TNFR2+196, FAS-670, and FAS-1377 genotypes were not associated with the risk of AD in our Chinese population. However, evidence suggests involvement of tumour necrosis factor-alpha pathway in the pathogenesis of AD and a more comprehensive study may be required to identify the underlying associations. © 2006 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists.

36248991885	Curcumin effects on blood lipid profile in a 6-month human study	Studies in animals and a short-term human study have suggested that curcumin, a polyphenolic compound concentrated in the curry spice turmeric, decreases serum cholesterol concentration. However, no controlled human trials have examined the effect of curcumin on cholesterol. This study investigated the effects of consuming curcumin on the serum lipid profile in men and women. Elderly subjects (n = 36) consumed 4 g/d curcumin, 1 g/d curcumin, or placebo in a 6-month, randomized, double-blind trial. Plasma curcumin and its metabolites were measured at 1 month, and the serum lipid profile was measured at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months. The plasma curcumin concentration reached a mean of 490 nmol/L. The curcumin concentration was greater after capsule than powder administration. Consumption of either dose of curcumin did not significantly affect triacylglycerols, or total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol over 1 month or 6 months. However, the concentrations of plasma curcumin and serum cholesterol were positively and significantly correlated. Curcumin consumption does not appear to have a significant effect on the serum lipid profile, unless the absorbed concentration of curcumin is considered, in which case curcumin may modestly increase cholesterol. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

0033043024	Sleep paralysis in the elderly	Isolated sleep paralysis (SP) is a common sleep phenomenon that is highly colored by indigenous beliefs. In Hong Kong Chinese, the 'ghost oppression phenomenon' (GO) has been shown to be descriptively identical to SP. The prevailing concept is that the majority of cases with SP have their onset during adolescence, but the lack of any systematic study on an older population means that late-onset cases can not be excluded. In a study investigating the prevalence of mental disorders in Chinese elderly aged above 70 y in Hong Kong, we employed the revised GO questionnaire to study the prevalence of SP in this group of elderly as well. One hundred and fifty-eight subjects were finally analyzed for the study. Almost 18% (95% C.I. 11.77%, 23.68%) of the subjects reported experiences of GO. Their description of the features of GO showed striking similarity to those of SP. There was a clear bimodal distribution of onset of GO with peaks during adolescence and after age 60 y. At least one-third of the cases were late onset. In concordance with the rapid eye movement (REM)/wakefulness dissociation hypothesis of SP, those elderly with GO + experiences also had more frequent nocturnal sleep disturbances. A family history was reported in 10% of subjects.

0032699599	A breakdown of event schemas in patients with schizophrenia: An examination of their script for dining at restaurants	Event schemas, the conceptualization of past experience, in schizophrenic patients were examined based upon script theory. Forty schizophrenic patients and 40 age- and education-matched normal control subjects participated in this study. This experiment consisted of three tasks. In the recall task, subjects recalled a typical scenario of going to a formal restaurant. In the frequency judgment task, subjects determined whether the given events happen frequently, occasionally or rarely in a restaurant. In the sequencing task, the subjects put the randomly presented events in the correct order. The responses of the schizophrenic patients in the recall task, when compared with those of the normal control subjects, had significantly fewer concepts and a greater proportion of highest-frequency concepts. In addition, the sequence of their responses was less accurate than that of normal individuals. This abnormality is unlikely due primarily to a retrieval deficit (i.e. generating fewer concepts in the recall task) given that their performances on the frequency judgment and sequencing tasks, tasks that require less retrieval effort, were consistent with those of the recall task. These results suggest that event schemas in schizophrenic patients contain little detailed information and are incoherent in organization. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

0033568345	Sleep problems in Chinese elderly in Hong Kong	Background: To examine the sleep habits and one-year prevalence of sleep disturbance (difficulty in falling asleep, broken sleep and early morning wakening) as well as insomnia (subjectively inadequate or poor sleep) in an elderly Chinese population in Hong Kong. Method: In Phase 1, a representative sample of elderly aged 70 years or above were interviewed with a sleep questionnaire, and Cantonese versions of the Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE) and Geriatric Depression Scale(CGDS). In Phase 2, those with scores suggestive of cognitive impairment on CMMSE or depression on CGDS were interviewed by psychiatrists for making clinical diagnoses according to DSM IV. Results: 1,034 elderly were interviewed in Phase 1. Occasional or persistent sleep disturbance were reported by 75% and insomnia in 38.2% of elderly. Slightly less than half of elderly with sleep disturbance complained of insomnia. Advancing age was associated with a higher rate of sleep disturbance while females had a higher rate of insomnia. Factors associated with sleep disturbance and insomnia included poor perceived health, past history of smoking, current depressive disorders, more chronic physical illness, more life events and more somatic complaints. Only 2.8% of the sample had taken sleeping pills within a one -year period. Conclusions: Sleep disturbance and insomnia are two separate but overlapping constructs and should be differentiated. Sleep disturbance is very common in the elderly and may be due to physiological changes with ageing. In contrast, those with a concommitant complaint of insomnia have impaired physical and mental health and may merit more medical attention.

0033765811	Dementia research in China	There is little information on dementia research in China in the international literature. This paper is an overview of studies on dementia conducted in China. Studies on dementia research in China were identified through a literature search, as well as through consulting Chinese psychiatrists and neurologists with expertise in the field. These studies were then reviewed. Epidemiological studies on dementia in China find the rates of dementia at the lower end of rates in Caucasians. There seems to be regional variation in the ratio of vascular dementia to Alzheimer's disease in China. In addition to epidemiological studies, there are studies on the genetics, psychopathology, neurophysiology and drug treatment in dementia. There is much research activity in China in the field of dementia and further cross-cultural studies are useful to examine the cultural differences in various areas of dementia research.

0033962644	Memory and organizational strategies in chronic and acute schizophrenic patients	The memory profile of acute and chronic schizophrenic patients was examined according to the information processing model, with which encoding, retention and retrieval processes of these patients were compared. The effects of an external organizational strategy on their verbal learning and memory were also examined. Twenty chronic and 20 acute schizophrenic patients were tested with a list learning task consisting of a random (i.e., words presented randomly) and a blocked (i.e., words presented in clusters) word- list. The schizophrenic patients, as compared with age- and education-matched normal control subjects, demonstrated impaired learning, and the duration of their illness was not a significant factor in the severity of their learning impairment. However, the acute and chronic schizophrenic patients seem able to retain most of the newly acquired materials, regardless of the presentation format, after 30 min. In addition, the learning and subjective organizational strategy of the chronic patients, but not that of the acute patients, improved significantly by the blocked presentation. However, semantic organization could facilitate both the chronic and acute schizophrenic patients to retain more newly learned items. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

77954562436	Diagnosis of schizophrenia: Reliability of an operationalized approach to 'praecox-feeling'	Background: H.C. Rumke coined the term 'praecox-feeling' to denote a specific unease experienced by the clinician reflecting the 'impossibility of empathy' and 'lack of exchange of affect' that has been reported to occur early on when examining schizophrenia patients. There is ample evidence that praecox-feeling is still relevant in modern clinical practice. This study examined the reliability of operationalized praecox-feeling against the background of modern diagnostic criteria and assessment methods. Sampling and Method: 102 consecutively admitted patients (37 with a diagnosis of schizophrenia) were interviewed within 2 days of their admission to a university-affiliated acute psychiatric unit. This initial interview was observed by 5 psychiatrists who had never seen the patients before. The interview lasted 2 min and consisted of standard, non-specific questions. The observing clinicians independently rated the absence or presence of praecox-feeling for each patient at 30 s and 2 min after encountering the patients. A sixth psychiatrist then examined the patients using the SCID-DSM-IV and all available information to reach a best estimate DSM-IV diagnosis. Results: Measured against a research diagnosis, praecox-feeling had unsatisfactory sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and area under the receiver-operator curves. There was no significant difference between the 30 s and the 2 min ratings of any of the 5 clinicians. Of the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, only early age of onset was significantly associated with praecox feeling for the majority of the raters. The raters' length of clinical experience did not correlate with the accuracy of their praecox-feeling. Conclusions: Measured against a best estimate research diagnosis in this study, praecox-feeling had modest sensitivity and specificity. Diagnostic agreement with the modern gold standard diagnosis of schizophrenia for all raters of praecox-feeling was poor. Although praecox-feeling appears to be an unreliable diagnostic compass, several lines of evidence suggest that its existence in clinical practice cannot be denied, which underscores the importance of a subjective element of unknown composition, magnitude and reliability in the diagnostic process that deserves more attention. © 2010 S.

84861566284	Conducting community research in rural China: Addressing the methodological challenges of recruiting participants in rapidly changing social environments	Introduction: The present paper addresses a unique challenge for public health and community research in rural China, i.e. the very large percentage of young adults that comprises a highly mobile working population that has been an essential component of the country's economic transformation. Fluid local demographic patterns potentially have a substantial impact on sample representativeness and data validity. Methods: This report is based upon a cross-sectional survey with face-to-face interviews of residents aged 16-34 years in rural communities of Mianyang, Sichuan Province, China. Two waves of fieldwork and other strategies were adopted in response to recruitment challenges. Results: 1654 of 3008 potential participants took part in the study; this constituted 98% of those individuals approached and 55% of the persons enumerated in the local household registration system (hukou). Analyses revealed substantial differences among those who were interviewed during September and October 2005, versus those seen during the Chinese Lunar New Year of 2006 when many migrant workers and students returned to their homes. Both groups together differed from those who were unavailable during either recruiting episode. Discussion: We discuss potential responses to associated methodological challenges, including (i) permanent hukou mismatches; (ii) temporary hukou mismatches; (iii) difficulties faced by potential participants to fully understand the purpose of research, the informed consent process, and specific research questions; and (iv) appreciation of the importance of local social networks, as they pertain in particular to rural China. These findings underscore that there may be a need to make "on-the-ground" adjustments to varying local conditions to maximize sample representativeness and data validity. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

The prostaglandins produced by COX-2 are involved in inflammation and pain response in different tissues in the body. Enhanced COX-2 expression had been found in regions of brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we proceeded to test the hypothesis that polymorphisms of the PTGS2 gene predispose to AD. IVS5-275 T>G and Ex10+837 T>C in addition to three tagging SNPs from HapMap database, which provided a comprehensive coverage of genetic variations in the PTGS2 gene in Chinese were genotyped among 257 AD patients and 244 age-matched healthy Chinese subjects.

4344630689	Category verbal fluency test performance in Chinese elderly with Alzheimer's disease	Introduction: The applicability of category verbal fluency test (VFT) as a screening test for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the Chinese population was studied. Methods: VFTs with categories of 'animal', 'fruit' and 'vegetable' were administrated to 72 subjects with AD and 81 aged-matched, community-dwelling, non-demented elderly (NC) in Hong Kong. Results: A significant difference in VFT scores between NC and AD groups was found (t-test, p < 0.05). CMMSE scores were significantly correlated with VFT performances in both subject groups. The correlation of combined VFT scores with age and educational level was significant only in the NC group (Pearson correlation, p < 0.05). At a cut-off score of 24/25, the sensitivity and specificity of the VFT in screening of dementia were 86.8 and 93.4% for subjects with no formal education. For literate subjects, an optimal cut-off score of 31/32 was identified across different educational levels. Conclusion: Although VFT performance was influenced by demographic factors like age and education, cognitive function was the most determining factor. With easy administration and satisfactory sensitivity and specificity, VFT is a useful and quick clinical screening test for AD in Chinese elderly. Copyright © 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

46249083340	Use of clinical dementia rating in detecting early cognitive deficits in a community-based sample of Chinese older persons in Hong Kong	With increasing demand for dementia care in the Chinese community, there is a pressing need to identify practical and valid assessment tool for early detection of dementia. In a sample of 473 randomly recruited community-dwelling Chinese older persons aged 60 or above, we evaluated the cognitive characteristics of subjects with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5. The cognitive profiles of CDR 0.5 subjects were compared with standard clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment. The Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale and list learning delay recall test scores were between - 1 and - 2 SD below the cutoff for clinically not-demented subjects (CDR 0). Concordance between CDR 0.5 and mild cognitive impairment classifications were related to educational level of the subjects.

Methods: A random sample of 765 Chinese elderly subjects from a thematic household survey was recruited. There were 389 normal elderly controls (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 0) (NC) and 376 subjects with questionable dementia (CDR 0.5). The subjects with questionable dementia (CDR 0.5) were categorized into two groups: a MCI group (n = 291) and a very mild dementia (VMD) group (n = 85). Parkinsonian signs were measured by Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-motor scale (UPDRS). The clinical correlates were investigated in each group. Results: UPDRS motor score was associated with age, cumulative medical illness burden and cerebrovascular accidents in the normal control and MCI groups. It correlated negatively with MMSE scores in the NC group. It was associated with presence of soft signs in the NC and MCI groups; and apathy in the VMD group. Conclusion: Neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment and vascular risk factors had different patterns of associations with parkinsonian signs in the older persons with different degree of cognitive impairment.

50149108220	Clinical correlates of functional performance in community-dwelling Chinese older persons with mild cognitive impairment	Background: Increasing evidence suggests that functional impairment can be detected in older persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study explores the functional profiles and the clinical correlates of a population-based sample of Chinese older persons with MCI in Hong Kong. Methods: A random sample of 765 Chinese elderly subjects without dementia was recruited, of which 389 were elderly normal controls (Clinical Dementia Rating = 0), and 376 had questionable dementia (CDR = 0.5). The latter were categorized into an MCI group (n = 291) and a very mild dementia (VMD) group (n = 85). Their functional performances were measured and compared with the normal controls (NC). Multiple regression analyses investigated the associations between functional scores (Disability Assessment in Dementia) and clinical correlates (cognitive test scores, neuropsychiatric symptoms and motor signs) in the NC subjects and cognitively impaired subjects. Results: Subjects with MCI had intermediate functional performance between the NC and those with VMD. Regression analyses revealed that lower scores of cognitive tests (delayed recall and categorical verbal fluency tests), apathy, aberrant motor symptoms and parkinsonism features were associated with lower functional scores in clinically non-demented subjects. Functional scores had no correlation with age, education and medical illness burden. Conclusion: Neuropsychiatric symptoms and parkinsonism features were associated with functional impairment in the clinically non-demented elderly in the community. Assessment of these should be incorporated in the evaluation of older persons for early cognitive impairment. © 2008 International Psychogeriatric Association.

53949125938	Association between HLA-A alleles and Alzheimer's disease in a Southern Chinese community	Background/Aim: HLA-A is a locus of the major histocompatibility complex situated on chromosome 6p21.3. Several genome-wide linkage analyses suggested that a putative locus predisposition for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is found on chromosome 6p21. In this study, we investigated the association between HLA-A alleles and AD in a Chinese community. Methods: Fine genotyping of 160 Chinese AD and 167 age-matched nondemented subjects was performed for the first time by sequence-based typing of the HLA-A locus. Results: We found that HLA-A2 carriers (including prevalent alleles, 0201, 0203 and 0207) were more prevalent in the AD group; the frequency of HLA-A2 was increased in AD patients versus controls, but the difference was not significant after Bonferroni correction for the number of alleles tested (p = 0.075). A gene-gene interaction was observed between ApoE and HLA-A, the presence of HLA-A24 (particularly the prevalent allele 2402) might act as another independent risk factor of developing AD for subjects not carrying the ApoE ε4 allele (relative risk = 2.98, 95% CI = 1.14-8.24). Carriers of HLA-A2 had an earlier onset of AD by 2.4 years (p = 0.030) and HLA-A2 interacted with ApoE ε4 in modulating the age at onset in AD. Conclusions: This study suggested that HLA-A may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.

Participants and Methods: The English version of the Assessment of Capacity for Everyday Decision-Making questionnaire was translated into Chinese. Its potential applicability was assessed by 2 focus groups. Eighteen Chinese psychogeriatric patients were recruited. Subjects were administered the Chinese instrument and assessed by independent clinician ratings based on the definition in the United Kingdom Mental Capacity Act 2005. Results: In the assessment of inter-rater reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient showed satisfactory reliability for the ability scores of understanding (0.99), appreciation (0.97), reasoning (0.99) and expressing a choice (0.85). The internal consistency, as measured by Cronbach's alpha, was 0.83 for understanding and 0.86 for reasoning. The ability scores of understanding and reasoning correlated with the clinician ratings. Conclusion: For this pilot study, the reliability of the Assessment of Capacity for Everyday Decision-Making Ability questionnaire for Chinese older patients was satisfactory. This instrument warrants further evaluation for its validity and applicability in other Chinese populations. © 2009 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists.

66549105981	Capacity to make treatment decisions in chinese older persons with very mild dementia and mild alzheimer disease	OBJECTIVES: This study aims at assessing mental competence in Chinese patients with mild and very mild dementia with a semistructured assessment method and the impact of repeated presentations of information on patientsĝ€™ mental competence. DESIGN: Subjects with mild and very mild dementia were compared with cognitively intact subjects. SETTING: Chinese subjects were recruited from local social centers and residential hostels for the elderly in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-six Chinese community-dwelling older adults (aged from 65 to 87 years) were recruited. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical diagnosis was made by experienced geriatric psychiatrists. Subjects were assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Mental capacity to consent to treatment was assessed by using the Chinese version of the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool ĝ€" Treatment (MacCAT-T) and independent clinician ratings based on the definition in the Mental Capacity Act 2005 of the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Thirty-three (50%) participants were diagnosed with very mild or mild dementia (CDR ≤ 0.5 or 1). In this group, 15 (45.5%) subjects were rated as mentally incompetent in clinician ratings. In the assessment of interrater reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient of MacCAT-T summary scores among three raters ranged from 0.64 to 0.83. The MacCAT-T summary scores correlated significantly with clinician ratings, years of education, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and CDR. In contrast to the nonimpaired group, repeated presentation of information did not significantly improve capacity in the demented group. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that even patients with very mild dementia in this population can show substantial deficits in decision-making capacity, and that improved capacity is not likely to result from repeated disclosure of information. © 2009 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

69149099912	Population-attributable risk of suicide conferred by axis I psychiatric diagnoses in a Hong Kong Chinese population	Objective: This study was conducted to determine the population- attributable risk (PAR) of completed suicide among Hong Kong Chinese with axis I psychiatric diagnoses. Methods: With a case-control psychological autopsy method, 150 suicide decedents aged 15-59 were compared for axis I psychiatric diagnoses and psychosocial variables with 150 randomly selected age- and gender-matched persons living in the community. Results: In the presence of other, non-disease-related social risk factors (unemployment and unmanageable debt), past suicide attempt independently accounted for 44% of the PAR of suicide, followed by current major depressive disorder (27%), schizophrenia spectrum disorders (22%), and substance use disorder or pathological gambling (16%). Other diagnoses (such as anxiety and phobic disorders, dysthymia, adjustment disorders, and past major depressive episode) accounted for 24% of PAR. Conclusions: Psychiatric morbidity remains the major risk factor for suicide in Hong Kong despite well-developed psychiatric services. Mental health policy should be refined to target clinical groups at high risk of suicide.

70350778518	Cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) polymorphisms are associated with faster cognitive deterioration in Chinese older persons: A two-year follow up study	Objectives: We previously found that the polymorphisms of cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) gene were associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Chinese. However, its effect in predicting progression of cognitive decline remains unknown. Methods: Two hundred and eighty-one Chinese subjects (121 cognitively intact, 101 with mild cognitive impairment and 59 with mildly dementia) were followed-up with a mean (SD) duration of 25.22(5.74) months. Association between the CYP46A1 gene polymorphisms and 2-year cognitive deterioration were evaluated. Results: At follow-up, 225(80.0%) subjects were reassessed. Sixty-three subjects were diagnosed as AD, 68 were MCI and 94 were cognitively intact. Among them, 158 had improved or remained stable while 67 deteriorated. The 'deteriorated' group was older than 'improved or stable' group (t-test, t=-2.87, p<0.001). IVS2-150 polymorphism was associated with a higher risk of cognitive deterioration. Subjects with Tallele were more likely to deteriorate compared with those without T allele (Pearson χ

70350499851	Polymorphisms of the estrogen receptor (ESR1) gene and the risk of Alzheimer's disease in a southern Chinese community	Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a higher prevalence in women. Expression of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene has been identified throughout the brain. Owing to the putative neuroprotective effects of estrogen, estrogen receptor gene is a potential candidate modulating the development of AD. Preliminary associations between two polymorphisms of ESR1 (PvuII and XbaI) gene and AD have been reported. Methods: In this study, 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ESR1 gene (including four commonly studied ESR1 SNPs and 12 other tagging SNPs selected from the HapMap database) were investigated to further evaluate the association between ESR1 polymorphisms and the risk of AD in the Chinese population. Results: A total of 233 Chinese AD patients and 245 age-matched elderly control subjects were recruited. Genetic associations were analyzed by chi-square test and interaction effect was analysed by logistic regression analysis. Five SNPs (clustered between intron 3 and intron 7) were associated with the risk of AD (p-value ranges from 0.001 to 0.035); another two SNPs (located on exon 2 and intron 2) were shown to modulate the age-at-onset (AAO) in AD (p-value = 0.036 and 0.011). Conclusions: ESR1 gene polymorphisms may be associated with the AAO in AD. The present results provided information for possible associations between certain polymorphisms of ESR1 gene and the risk of AD. © 2009 International Psychogeriatric Association.

70849110436	Optimal cut-off score on the Chinese version of executive interview (C-EXIT25) in a Hong Kong Chinese population	Objectives: To determine the optimal cut-off score on the Chinese version of the Executive Interview to discriminate all-cause dementia patients from non-dementia subjects. Participants and Methods: A total of 141 community-dwelling elders were assessed with the Chinese version of the Executive Interview, the Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination, and Nelson's Modified Card Sorting Test. Severity of dementia was determined using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. Results: Higher total scores on the Chinese version of Executive Interview (greater impairment) yielded a statistically significant negative correlation with Nelson's Modified Card Sorting Test's 'Number of categories', but positive correlations with the test's 'Errors', 'Perseverative errors', 'Non-perseverative errors', and 'Percentage of perseverative errors'. The sensitivity and specificity at different cut-off values on the Chinese version of the Executive Interview used to plot the receiver operating characteristic curve gave an area under the curve of 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.94-0.99; p ≤ 0.01). The cut-off value of 15 best distinguished Clinical Dementia Rating 0 and 0.5 from Clinical Dementia Rating 1 and 2 (sensitivity = 90.7%; specificity = 87.2%). Conclusions: The results of the current study and the previous pilot study support that the Chinese version of the Executive Interview as a potentially useful bedside tool for executive functional assessment in Chinese elders, by virtue of good internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, concurrent validity and discriminatory power. © 2009 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists.

0035001483	Behavioral profile of Alzheimer's disease in Chinese elderly - A validation study of the Chinese version of the Alzheimer's disease behavioral pathology rating scale	Objectives: This study aims to examine the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Alzheimer's disease behavioral pathology rating scale (CBehave-AD) and the behavioral profile of Chinese patients with AD. Methods: Seventy-one subjects with NINCDS-ADRDA diagnosis of probable and possible AD were assessed for validation of the CBehave-AD. A behavioral symptom frequency checklist, the Chinese version of the Blessed Roth dementia scale (CDS) and the Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE) were used for comparison. An extended sample of 120 AD patients was then evaluated with the CBehave-AD. Results: High correlations between the CBehave-AD and checklist scores were found (paranoid and delusional ideation, hallucinations, activity disturbances, aggressiveness and diurnal rhythm disturbances). The scale also demonstrated satisfactory inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities. The mean (SD) CMMSE score of the 120 patients was 9.4 (7.1). Among them, 32% have delusions, 15% had hallucinations, 54% had activity disturbances, 61% had aggressive behavior, 44% had sleep disturbance, 24% had affective disturbances, 19% had anxiety and phobias. Delusional ideation was significantly associated with hallucinations, aggressiveness, and affective disturbances. Diurnal rhythm disturbances were associated with activity disturbances and aggressiveness. CBehave-AD total scores were not significantly correlated with severity of AD, but individual symptom categories showed different pattern of correlation. Delusions, hallucinations, anxiety and phobias were significantly correlated with dementia staging. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the CBehave-AD is a valid assessment tool for behavioral disturbances in patients with AD. Variable associations between different symptom categories and dementia staging suggest a need for further exploration of the complex interactions between behavioral and cognitive disturbances in dementia.

0034846346	Validation study of the Chinese version of the neuropsychiatric inventory (CNPI)	Background: More validated instruments for assessment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia are required to facilitate local dementia research. Method: The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the neuropsychiatric inventory (CNPI) were tested in a sample of 62 dementia outpatients. The concurrent validity was tested by measuring the Spearman correlation between CNPI subscales with the appropriate subscales of BEHAVE-AD and the Chinese Hamilton rating scale of depression (CHDS). The internal consistency reliability, false-negative rates of the screening questions of CNPI and inter-rater reliability were determined. Result: Most CNPI behavioral domains achieved significant correlation with the corresponding BEHAVE-AD and CHDS subscales. Cronbach alpha for the overall reliability was 0.84. The false-negative rates of the screening question were acceptable except for the dysphoria, sleep and appetite domains. The inter-rater reliability was satisfactory with intraclass correlation coefficient of all subscales above 0.9. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the applicability of the CNPI in assessing the neuropsychiatric manifestations of dementia in the Chinese community. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

0035180891	Agitation in Chinese elderly: Validation of the Chinese version of the Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory	The reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CCMAI) were studied in 164 demented patients. The agitation pattern in Chinese elderly was also examined in this study. The CCMAI demonstrated high validity, test-retest reliability, and interrater reliability. Eighty-five percent of demented patients manifested one or more agitated behaviors at least once a week. Factor analysis yielded three subtypes of agitation: physically aggressive behaviors, physically nonaggressive behaviors, and verbally agitated behaviors. There was a linear upward trend in physical aggression as one progressed from one Global Deterioration Scale stage to the next. Community-living patients showed higher physically nonaggressive and verbally agitated behaviors, whereas institution residents exhibited a significantly higher level of physical aggression. The differences between residential and institutionalized patients need further research. Future study should focus not only on the behavioral disturbances; medical, psychological, and environmental factors should be taken into account to provide a more accurate profile.

0035189653	Cytochrome P450 2D6 genotyping and association with tardive dyskinesia in Chinese schizophrenic patients	Background: The discovery of Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP 2D6) polymorphism is implicated in individual differences in drug metabolism rate. Mutation with defective alleles is associated with reduced metabolism of many antipsychotic drugs metabolized by CYP 2D6. This may contribute to the development of tardive dyskinesia (TD) in patients with prolonged exposure to anti-psychotic drugs. Methods: In this controlled study, the genotype of CYP 2D6* 10 alleles, movement disorders and clinical characteristics in 38 Chinese schizophrenic patients with TD were compared with 38 age-and sex-matched schizophrenia patients without TD. Results: There was no significant correlation between CYP 2D6* 10 genotypes and TD in men. However, a significant increase in the frequency of CYP 2D6* 10 allele was found in female patients with TD. Conclusions: The sex differences in CYP 2D6 genotyping and vulnerability to develop TD suggest that a biological predisposition that affects pharmacokinetics may be more significant in women, whereas other factors may be more important in men.

75149114050	Examining the association between participation in late-life leisure activities and cognitive function in community-dwelling elderly Chinese in Hong Kong	Background: Growing evidence suggests that participation in late-life leisure activity may have beneficial effects on cognitive function. The objective of the study was to evaluate the association between leisure activity participation and cognitive function in an elderly population of community-dwelling Hong Kong Chinese. Methods: 512 participants were assessed in the follow-up study of a population-based community survey of the prevalence of cognitive impairment among Hong Kong Chinese aged 60 years and over. Leisure activities were classified into four categories (physical, intellectual, social and recreational). Information regarding leisure activity participation, cognitive function and other variables was collected. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to examine the association between leisure activity participation and cognitive function. Results: A higher level of late-life leisure activity participation, particularly in intellectual activities, was significantly associated with better cognitive function in the elderly, as reflected by the results of the Cantonese Mini-mental State Examination (p = 0.007, 0.029 and 0.005), the Category Verbal Fluency Test (p = 0.027, 0.003 and 0.005) and digit backward span (p = 0.031, 0.002 and 0.009), as measured by the total frequency, total hours per week and total number of subtypes, respectively; the Chinese Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (p = 0.045) and word list learning (p = 0.003), as measured by the total number of subtypes; and digit forward span (p = 0.007 and 0.015), as measured by the total hours per week and total number of subtypes, respectively. Conclusion: Late-life intellectual activity participation was associated with better cognitive function among community-dwelling Hong Kong elderly Chinese. © International Psychogeriatric Association 2009.

76549090757	What does psychological autopsy study tell us about charcoal burning suicide- A new and contagious method in Asia?	Charocal burning suicides in Hong Kong between 2002-2004 in the 15 to 59-year-old age group were investigated using the psychological autopsy method. The psychopathological profiles of charcoal burning suicides (N=53) were compared against "other suicides" (N=57). The two group did not differ significantly in the prevalence of DSM-IV axis I diagnoses with the exception of schizophrenic specturn disorder which was less frequently associated with charcoal burning suicides. Score on "neuroticism" in the NEO-five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) was significantly higher in victims of charcoal burning suicide. There was also a trend toward higher score on "conscientiouness" in the NEO-FFI among charcoal burners than victims of other suicide. © 2009 The American Association of Suicidology.

77949423502	Serum zinc is decreased in Alzheimer's disease and serum arsenic correlates positively with cognitive ability	Zinc, copper, and iron aggregate Aβ and accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) plaques. Some metals are increased in AD vs. control serum. The authors examined levels of 12 metals in serum of 44 AD and 41 control subjects. Zinc decreased from 12.3 to 10.9 μmol/L (means, p = 0.0007). Arsenic positively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination score (p<0.0001). Zinc deposition in brain amyloid might deplete zinc from other body compartments, such as serum. The arsenic correlation might be caused by the major contribution of seafood consumption to intake of both arsenic and docosahexaenoic acid, of which the latter may delay AD. © Springer Science+Business Media.

77958035334	Prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in chinese older persons with mild cognitive impairment-A population-based study	Objectives: To estimate the point prevalence and correlates of neuropsychiatric (NP) symptoms among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal cognition (NC) in a Chinese community. Design: Cross-sectional study derived from a population-based prevalence study of MCI and dementia. Setting and Participants: This survey was conducted in Hong Kong from 2005 to 2006. Seven hundred eighty-eight community-dwelling older adults (450 NC and 338 MCI) were recruited. Cognitive and NP data were obtained. Results: The point prevalence of at least one NP symptom in NC and MCI were 29% and 36.7%, respectively (logistic regression controlled for age and education, odds ratio = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.89, Wald χ = 4.10, df = 1, p = 0.04). Agitation (1.8% versus 5.1%), apathy (7.6% versus 15.2%), and irritability (4.2% versus 8%) were more prevalent in subjects with MCI (p <0.05). Logistic regression analyses showed that apathy score was a significant factor associated with the status of NC or MCI (logistic regression, apathy, p = 0.031, Exp(B) = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02-1.47; Hosmer and Lemeshow test, χ = 8.6, df = 8, p = 0.38, R = 0.23). Conclusions: The authors reported the findings of one of the first population-based studies estimating the point prevalence of NP symptoms in Asian older adults with MCI. Taking into account of its prevalence and magnitude of effects, apathy is a clinically significant symptom in MCI. Its predictive value for conversion to dementia warrants further evaluation. © 2010 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

77957293806	Neuropsychological performance predicts decision-making abilities in Chinese older persons with mild or very mild dementia	Objective: To explore the relationship of the 4 decision-making abilities (Understanding, Appreciation, Reasoning, and Expressing a Choice) and neuropsychological performance in patients with very mild and mild dementia. Methods: Chinese subjects were recruited from local social centres and residential hostels for elderly people in Hong Kong. Clinical diagnosis was made by experienced geriatric psychiatrists. A battery of neuropsychological tests that assesses general cognitive abilities, verbal memory, executive function, concept formation, and auditory and visual attention, was administered. Mental capacity to consent to treatment was assessed using the Chinese version of the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool - Treatment. Results: Fifty participants with very mild or mild dementia were compared with 42 cognitively intact subjects. After controlling for the effects of age and education, stepwise linear regression analysis demonstrated that the 4 decision-making abilities correlated with different neuropsychological test performances, which predicted 45% of the common variance for Understanding, 39% for Appreciation, 20% for Reasoning, and 30% for Expressing a Choice. The Reasoning score was only predicted by the Category Verbal Fluency Test (β = 0.4, p = 0.01). Conclusion: Neuropsychological test performance differentially predicted different decision-making abilities in older patients with mild or very mild dementia. © 2010 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists.

77958557446	Prospective memory deficits in patients with bipolar disorder: A preliminary study	Prospective memory (PM) is the ability to remember to do something in the future without explicit prompts. To date, little has been known about PM deficits in bipolar disorder (BD). This study examined the nature and correlates of PM in patients with BD. Forty clinically stable BD patients and 40 matched healthy controls formed the study sample. Socio-demographic characteristics, PM, psychosocial functioning, retrospective memory (RM), and IQ were measured in all participants, whereas clinical condition was measured in patients with standardized assessment instruments. Patients performed significantly more poorly on the time-based PM task than controls (10.6 ± 5.0 vs. 14.6 ± 3.0, p <. 001). In correlation analyses, older age, lower education, more severe depressive and manic symptoms, poor psychosocial functioning, poor RM, and lower scores in IQ were significantly associated with poor performance in the time-based PM task, whereas poor RM and lower scores in IQ associated with poorer performance in the event-based PM task in patients. In multivariate analyses, severity of depression and older age significantly contributed to poor performance in the time-based PM task, whereas poor RM contributed to poor performance in the event-based PM task in patients. The time-based PM is impaired in BD patients. Depressive symptoms, age, and RM were determinants of certain aspects of impaired PM performance in BD patients. © The Author 2010.

77958580778	Independent association of prospective memory with retrospective memory and intelligence in schizophrenia: A controlled study	Prospective memory (PM) refers to the ability to remember to do something in the future. This study examined the relationship between three PM subtypes, and intelligence and retrospective memory (RM) in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. The study sample comprised 110 schizophrenia patients and 110 healthy controls matched according to age, sex, and level of education. The patients' clinical condition was evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Time-, event-, and activity-based PM and RM (immediate and delayed Logical Memory subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scales-Revised), executive functioning (Design Fluency Test, Tower of London-4 disk, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test), and intelligence (Raven's Progressive Matrices) tests were administered to all participants. Correlation analyses showed time- and event-based PM to be significantly associated with RM in both the patients and controls, but with intelligence only in the patients. After controlling for covariates, only time-based PM was associated with RM in the controls and only event-based PM with intelligence in the patients. In schizophrenia, PM deficit may arise from the impairments of the retrospective components of memory. © The Author 2010.

78449308552	Association of demographic characteristics, symptomatology, retrospective and prospective memory, executive functioning and intelligence with social functioning in schizophrenia	Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the influence of socio-demographic and clinical factors and neurocognitive variables (i.e. prospective and retrospective memory, executive functioning, and intelligence) on social functioning in Chinese schizophrenia patients. Methods: The study sample comprised 110 Chinese schizophrenia patients. Their clinical condition and social functioning were evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Functional Needs Assessment (FNA), respectively. Three prospective memory (PM) tasks (time-, event-, and activity-based), three tests of executive functioning (the Design Fluency Test [DFT], Tower of London [TOL], and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [WCST]), one test of intelligence (Raven's Progressive Matrices), and two retrospective memory (RM) tasks (the immediate and delayed recall conditions of the Logical Memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scales-Revised [WMS-R]) were administered to all patients. Results: In correlation analyses higher education and better performance on the WCST (categories completed) and the Logical Memory subtests (delayed and immediate) of the WMS-R are significantly correlated with better social functioning, whereas a lower WCST score (perseverative errors) and more severe negative symptoms are associated with poorer social functioning. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that higher education and a lower WCST score (perseverative errors) independently contribute to better social functioning. Conclusions: Unexpectedly, most socio-demographic and clinical factors do not seem to have a significant impact on social functioning of Chinese schizophrenia patients living in a Chinese society. Negative symptoms and certain cognitive deficits were the main predictors of social functioning and they should be the main targets for antipsychotic treatment and psychosocial interventions to improve social adjustment in Chinese schizophrenia patients. © 2010 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.

78650374202	Examining the association between late-life leisure activity participation and global cognitive decline in community-dwelling elderly Chinese in Hong Kong	Objective This study examines the association between late-life leisure activity participation and global cognitive decline in community-dwelling elderly Chinese in Hong Kong. Methods Five hundred and five participants, not clinically demented at the baseline, were analysed in the follow-up study of a population-based community survey among Hong Kong Chinese aged 60 and over. Information regarding leisure activity participation, global cognitive function and important sociodemographic variables was collected. Late life leisure activity profiles were classified into intellectual, social, physical and recreational categories, and were measured by total hours per week, total frequency and total number of subtypes. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between leisure activity participation at the baseline and the incidence of global cognitive decline at the 22-month follow-up. The incidence of global cognitive decline was defined as a one-point drop in z-score of the Cantonese version of the mini-mental state examination (CMMSE). Results At the follow-up, a higher level of participation in intellectual activities was significantly associated with a lower incidence of global cognitive decline as measured by both the total hours per week (multivariate-adjusted OR 0.97 (95% CI 0.94-0.99, pa-=a-0.003)), and the total number of subtypes (multivariate-adjusted OR 0.74 (95% CI 0.58-0.95, pa-=a-0.018)). Conclusions A higher level of late-life intellectual activity participation was associated with less global cognitive decline among community-dwelling elderly Chinese in Hong Kong.

78651325616	Lived experience of caregivers of persons with dementia in Hong Kong: A qualitative study	Objectives: To report the lived experience of caregivers of persons with dementia in Hong Kong, and to explore their service needs. Methods: This was a qualitative study of caregivers of persons with dementia. Four focus group interviews, each group comprising 6 to 7 informal caregivers, were conducted. A total of 27 participants were recruited. With the participants' consent, interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Colaizzi's methods for phenomenological analysis were used. Results: Caregiving in dementia in Hong Kong is as demanding and challenging as reported in other developed communities. 'Confusion regarding diagnosis', 'Emotional impact', 'Difficulty in coping with the care recipient behaviours', 'Provision of care recipient's daily care needs is demanding', and 'Conflicts among social roles' were themes pervasive across every focus group. In addition, the needs of carers changed as the disease of their care recipients progressed. Conclusions: As the local population continues to age, family caregivers are faced with increasing demands. Understanding their experience is pivotal in the design of effective carer support services. Our findings highlight the sources of strain and unmet needs of Hong Kong Chinese caregivers, which may serve as a guide for future service development. © 2010 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists.

79551485692	Outcomes of a two-tiered multifaceted elderly suicide prevention program in a hong kong chinese community	Objectives: 1) To compare the 2-year completed suicide and reattempt rates in a preintervention group of Hong Kong Chinese suicide attempters (aged 65 years and older) who received standard care and a postintervention group enrolled in a regional elderly suicide prevention program (ESPP) that adopts a two-tiered multifaceted care management model and 2) to examine the trend of suicide rates in older adults aged 65 years and older in the pre- and postintervention periods. Design: The first part is an observational cohort study with baseline, follow-up, and outcome data being identified from a clinical electronic registry. The second part examines changes in suicide rates from official mortality statistics. Setting: A government-funded suicide intervention program serving catchment population (852,796 people aged 65 years and older) in Hong Kong, China. Participants: Suicide attempters (aged 65 years and older) presenting to old-age psychiatric service in the pre- and postintervention phases. Measurements: 1) Two-year rates of completed suicide and suicide reattempt and 2) changes in population suicide rates in the pre- and postintervention periods. Results: The 2-year completed suicide rate was 7.58% in the preintervention group (N = 66) and 1.99$% in the ESPP group (N = 351) Χ = 6.192; p value: 0.028; df = 1). Reattempt rates were not different. At a population level, suicide rate dropped significantly only in women aged 85 years and older, relative to the preintervention period. Conclusions: The ESPP was associated with a reduced rate of completed suicide in old-age suicide attempters and might have contributed to a fall of suicide rate in women aged 85 years and older. © 2011 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

Subjects 389 Chinese older persons with either a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR 0.5) or amnestic-MCI participated in an exercise program. The exercise intervention lasted for 1 year; 171 subjects were trained with 24 forms simplified Tai Chi (Intervention, I) and 218 were trained with stretching and toning exercise (Control, C). The exercise comprised of advised exercise sessions of at least three times per week. Results At 5th months (2 months after completion of training), both I and C subjects showed an improvement in global cognitive function, delayed recall and subjective cognitive complaints (paired t-tests, p < 0.05). Improvements in visual spans and CDR sum of boxes scores were observed in I group (paired t-tests, p < 0.001). Three (2.2%) and 21(10.8%) subjects from the I and C groups progressed to dementia (Pearson chi square = 8.71, OR = 5.34, 95% CI 1.56-18.29). Logistic regression analysis controlled for baseline group differences in education and cognitive function suggested I group was associated with stable CDR (OR = 0.14, 95%CI = 0.03-0.71, p = 0.02). Conclusions Our interim findings showed that Chinese style mind body (Tai Chi) exercise may offer specific benefits to cognition, potential clinical interests should be further explored with longer observation period.

79955578082	Suicidal ideation and attempts among rural Chinese aged 16-34 years - Socio-demographic correlates in the context of a transforming China	Background: The distinctive epidemiologic profile of suicide in China, with notably high rates among rural young adult females, invites examination of possible underlying risk factors. Although there are accumulating data regarding the epidemiology of suicide among youth and young adults in China, there are meager data on suicidal ideation and attempts despite its importance. Methods: Our study in 2005-06 sought to identify all potentially suitable rural participants, aged 16-34 years, from 10 representative villages in rural Sichuan Province. We conducted structured interviews regarding a range of socio-demographic characteristics and suicidal morbidity. Results: 1654 of a potential 3008 participants participated; lifetime and one-year prevalence were: suicidal ideation (18.8% and 5.2%), serious ideation (8.6% and 2.3%), planning (5.8% and 1.5%), and attempt (2.7% and 0.5%). Comparisons among strata of socio-demographic characteristics showed more prevalent suicidal ideation associated with: female gender, lower education, poorer financial perception, greater rurality of residence, and marital status of "never married" or "others". Suicidal attempt was associated with: female gender and a marital status of "others". Limitations: The study was carried out in one province and caution is required when considering other rural regions of China. There were a substantial number of unapproachable subjects because of their migrant work at distant sites. Conclusions: Our results revealed an apparently higher prevalence for suicide ideation and planning compared with residents of other countries, but a lower prevalence for attempts. These data suggests that the relatively high rate of suicide in rural China reflects an elevated case fatality ratio due to chosen methods. The results also revealed unique patterns for correlates with the occurrence of ideation and attempts. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

79955793096	Depression care management for late-life depression in China primary care: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial	Background: As a major public health issue in China and worldwide, late-life depression is associated with physical limitations, greater functional impairment, increased utilization and cost of health care, and suicide. Like other chronic diseases in elders such as hypertension and diabetes, depression is a chronic disease that the new National Health Policy of China indicates should be managed in primary care settings. Collaborative care, linking primary and mental health specialty care, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of late-life depression in primary care settings in Western countries. The primary aim of this project is to implement a depression care management (DCM) intervention, and examine its effectiveness on the depressive symptoms of older patients in Chinese primary care settings.Methods/Design: The trial is a multi-site, primary clinic based randomized controlled trial design in Hangzhou, China. Sixteen primary care clinics will be enrolled in and randomly assigned to deliver either DCM or care as usual (CAU) (8 clinics each) to 320 patients (aged ≥ 60 years) with major depression (20/clinic; n = 160 in each treatment condition). In the DCM arm, primary care physicians (PCPs) will prescribe 16 weeks of antidepressant medication according to the treatment guideline protocol. Care managers monitor the progress of treatment and side effects, educate patients/family, and facilitate communication between providers; psychiatrists will provide weekly group psychiatric consultation and CM supervision. Patients in both DCM and CAU arms will be assessed by clinical research coordinators at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 months. Depressive symptoms, functional status, treatment stigma and clients' satisfaction will be used to assess patients' outcomes; and clinic practices, attitudes/knowledge, and satisfaction will be providers' outcomes.Discussion: This will be the first trial of the effectiveness of a collaborative care intervention aiming to the management of late-life depression in China primary care. If effective, its finding will have relevance to policy makers who wish to scale up DCM treatments for late-life depression in national wide primary care across China.Study Registration: The DCM project is registered through the National Institutes of Health sponsored by clinical trials registry and has been assigned the identifier: NCT01287494. © 2011 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0036161050	Neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer's disease differ in Chinese and American patients	Background: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease is similar across ethnic groups. To our knowledge, no comparison of behavioral symptoms has been addressed. Objective: This cross-sectional, retrospective, descriptive study compares neuropsychiatric symptoms of Chinese subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) at tertiary care centers in Taiwan and Hong Kong against Caucasian subjects in Los Angeles, California. We compared the frequency and severity of symptoms and caregiver responses to neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). We hypothesized that Chinese patients do not seek care unless they have high severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms and that Caucasian Americans do not wait for behavioral disturbances to develop before coming to medical attention. Results: The Caucasian sample had the highest mean educational level and mildest Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale distributions of all four groups. Older age and lower educational levels contributed to higher CDR scale scores, which in turn correlated with higher total NPI scores. Only one of the Chinese samples had a higher frequency of severe neuropsychiatric symptoms than the Caucasian sample. Chinese caregivers reported anxiety and delusions more frequently (58.1%) than Caucasians (37.3% and 39.6%; Χ

0036163484	Effect of neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer's disease on Chinese and American caregivers	Background: In Chinese culture, extended family support, acceptance of age-related cognitive changes and filial tradition of caring for elders may decrease caregiver burden and distress in the context of dementia. Objective: To study cross-regional and cross-cultural differences in symptom-related caregiver distress due to the behavioral problems of Chinese and American patients with Alzheimer's disease. Method: Caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan (n=89), Chinese University of Hong Kong (n = 31) and the UCLA Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Los Angeles, California (n = 169) reported the neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients and their corresponding distress on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Result: Presence or absence of distress due to the neuropsychiatric symptoms of the patients with Alzheimer's disease was assessed. The three centers differed significantly in the proportions of caregivers with distress caused by depression (p<0.05) and apathy (p<0.001). UCLA had higher proportions of caregivers with depression-related distress than Taipei. UCLA caregivers were also more stressed by apathy than caregivers in Taipei and Hong Kong. Logistic regression further supported the findings that depression-related and apathy-related caregiver distress differed between Chinese and American caregivers (p<0.05). Conclusions: The results were surprising, in that American and Chinese (Taipei and Hong Kong) caregivers exhibited similar distress or lack of distress in response to delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, euphoria, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, sleep and appetite symptoms of Alzheimer's disease patients. Chinese caregivers were less affected by depression and apathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease than Caucasian caregivers. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

0035674311	A double-blind randomised comparison of risperidone and haloperidol in the treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms in Chinese dementia patients	Background: Behavioural and psychological (BPSD) are common during the course of dementia and present severe problems to patients and their caregivers. Objectives: To assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of haloperidol and risperidone in treating BPSD in Chinese dementia patients. Methods: A 12-week double-blind randomised comparison of haloperidol and risperidone treatments was conducted in 58 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer's type or vascular dementia. They were randomly assigned to receive flexible doses (0.5 to 2 mg/day) of haloperidol or risperidone. Clinical response was evaluated using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), Simpson-Angus Scale, Functional Assessment Staging and Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination. Results: The mean doses at the last week were 0.90 mg/day of haloperidol and 0.85 mg/day of risperidone. Both haloperidol and risperidone significantly reduced the severity of BPSD (scores on CMAI an BEHAVE-AD), with no significant between-group differences. Haloperidol-treated patients showed a worsening on Simpson-Angus scale while there was no significant change in this measure in risperodine-treated patients. Conclusions: Low-dose haloperidol and risperidone were well tolerated and associated with reductions in the severity and frequency of behavioural symptoms in subjects with dementia. Risperidone may have a more favourable risk-benefit profile in view of its lower propensity to induce extrapyramidal symptoms. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

0036253036	Utility of olfactory identification test for diagnosing Chinese patients with Alzheimer's disease	The present study examined the utility of two tests, the olfactory identification test and the olfactory threshold test, in detecting dementia of the Alzheimer's type in Chinese patients in Hong Kong. The olfactory identification test developed by Murphy, Anderson, and Markinson (1994) was utilized with some modifications of odor stimuli suitable for the Chinese culture. Results showed that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) identified significantly fewer odors and had significantly higher olfactory threshold than their age- and education-matched normal control subjects. With the cut-off point of 5 identified odors (out of 6), the olfactory identification test yielded a sensitivity of 83% in discriminating AD patients from normal controls which was consistent with that reported by Morgan, Nordin, and Murphy (1995). Thus, the present results suggested that the olfactory identification test could be applied cross-culturally for identifying patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.

8344233364	Effects of education and culture on the validity of the Geriatric Mental State and its AGECAT algorithm	Background: The Geriatric Mental State (GMS) is the most widely used psychiatric research assessment for older persons. Evidence for validity comes from the developed world. Aims: To assess the validity of GMS/AGECATorganicity and depression diagnoses in 26 centres in India, China, Latin America and Africa. Method: We studied 2941 persons aged 60 years and over: 742 people with dementia and three groups free of dementia (697 with depression, 719 with high and 783 with low levels of education). Local clinicians diagnosed dementia (DSM-IV) and depression (Montgomery- Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score ≥ 18). Results: For dementia diagnosis GMS/AGECAT performed well in many centres but educational bias;was evident. Specificity was poor in India and sensitivity sub-optimal in Latin America. A predictive algorithm excluding certain orientation items but including interviewer judgements improved upon the AGEGAT algorithm. For depression, sensitivity was high. The EURO-D depression scale, derived from GMS items using European data, has a similar factor structure America, India and, to a lesser extent China. Conclusions: Valid, comprehensive mental status assessment across cultures seems achievable in principle.

84857793121	NEDD9 gene polymorphism influences the risk of Alzheimer disease and cognitive function in Chinese older persons	Neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated (NEDD9) gene was a new candidate risk gene for Alzheimer disease (AD). The CC genotype of a single nucleotide polymorphism rs760678 within this gene was associated with increasing risk of AD in a large study with white population. Our study aimed to replicate the initial report in Chinese population and explore its effect on cognitive performance.

84856970634	A PIN1 polymorphism that prevents its suppression by AP4 associates with delayed onset of Alzheimer's disease	Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau and senile plaques of amyloid-beta peptides (Aβ) derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP). Pin1 is a unique prolyl isomerase that has been shown to protect against age-dependent neurodegeneration by acting on phosphorylated tau and APP to suppress tangle formation and amyloidogenic APP processing. Here we report a functional polymorphism, rs2287839, in the Pin1 promoter that is significantly associated with a 3-year delay in the average age at onset (AAO) of late-onset AD in a Chinese population. More significantly, the Pin1 polymorphism rs2287839 is located within the consensus binding motif for the brain-selective transcription factor, AP4 (CAGCT. G) and almost completely abolishes the ability of AP4 to bind and suppress the Pin1 promoter, as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and promoter luciferase assay. Moreover, overexpression or knockdown of AP4 resulted in an 80% reduction or 2-fold increase in endogenous Pin1 levels, respectively. Thus, AP4 is a novel transcriptional repressor of Pin1 expression and the Pin1 promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identified in this study that prevents such suppression is associated with delayed onset of AD. These results indicate that regulation of Pin1 by AP4 plays a critical role in determining age at onset of AD and might be a novel therapeutic target to delay the onset of AD. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84861088131	Capacity to make decisions on medication management in Chinese older persons with mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease	Background: This study aimed to assess if decisional capacity and the four decision-making abilities related to decisions concerning medication management were impaired among community-dwelling Chinese older persons in Hong Kong with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), as compared with cognitively normal older adults. Methods: Two hundred and ninety-one Chinese community-dwelling older adults were recruited. The four decision-making abilities and decisional capacity were assessed by using the Chinese version of the Assessment of Capacity for Everyday Decision-Making (ACED) and independent clinician ratings based on the definition in the UK Mental Capacity Act 2005, respectively. Results: Ninety-nine participants (34%) were diagnosed with MCI and ninety-five (33%) with mild AD. Although almost all (96%) of the participants in the MCI group were found to be mentally competent to make decisions on medication management in clinician ratings, their decision-making abilities as measured by the ACED were significantly lower than those of the cognitively normal controls. Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that abilities related to decisions on medication management are impaired before the clinical diagnosis of dementia is made. Use of specific and structured assessment of the relevant decisional abilities may enhance clinical judgment. © Copyright 2012 International Psychogeriatric Association.

0037211445	Validity and applicability of the Chinese version of community screening instrument for dementia	The development of an educationally independent screening instrument for dementia is most valuable for epidemiological studies. The Community Screening Instrument for Dementia (CSI-D) was applied to 120 subjects, with 30 matched for age in each of the four groups of mild to moderately demented, depressed, low-education and high-education normal control subjects. The internal consistency and interrater reliability of CSI-D were satisfactory. Correlation with the ten-word-list learning task, a test sensitive to early dementia, was high. CSI-D could differentiate the demented from non-demented subjects, but not the high- from the low-education control group. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed good test performance of CSI-D. In conclusion, the Chinese version of CSI-D is a valid, reliable and educationally independent screening instrument for dementia sensitive to detect early stage of the disease. Copyright © 2003 S.

0037044693	Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8 (apolipoprotein E receptor 2) gene polymorphisms in Alzheimer's disease	Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoforms affect the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE-associated risk may be related to its binding to and clearance by cell surface receptors, such as the members of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family. Previous studies had shown association of LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) and AD, therefore we speculated that another member of this LDL receptor family, LRP8 (also called apolipoprotein E receptor 2 or ApoER2), which is predominantly expressed in brain, might be associated with Alzheimer's disease. To explore this hypothesis, we screened exons 2-19 of the LRP8 gene in a total of 204 AD and 184 elderly control subjects for polymorphisms using the conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis method. Our results revealed four sequence alterations: two predicted to result in amino acid changes (E46D and R952Q), one in an intron (IVS9+7G>A), and one synonymous polymorphism (2622T>C). The latter was found in four AD patients (2.0%) and 11 controls (6.0%), a significant difference (P=0.042). Further study is needed to confirm this possible association of LRP8 with AD. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

0037444065	Dementia diagnosis in developing countries: A cross-cultural validation study	Background: Research into dementia is needed in developing countries. Assessment of variations in disease frequency between regions might enhance our understanding of the disease, but methodological difficulties need to be addressed. We aimed to develop and test a culturally and educationally unbiased diagnostic instrument for dementia. Methods: In a multicentre study, the 10/66 Dementia Research Group interviewed 2885 people aged 60 years and older in 25 centres, most in Universities, in India, China and southeast Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa. 729 had dementia and three groups were free of dementia: 702 had depression, 694 had high education (as defined by each centre), and 760 had low education (as defined by each centre). Local clinicians diagnosed dementia and depression. An interviewer, masked to dementia diagnosis, administered the geriatric mental state, the community screening instrument for dementia, and the modified Consortium to Establish a Registry of Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) ten-word list-learning task. Findings: Each measure independently predicted a diagnosis of dementia. In an analysis of half the sample, an algorithm derived from all three measures gave better results than any individual measure. Applied to the other half of the sample, this algorithm identified 94% of dementia cases with false-positive rates of 15%, 3%, and 6% in the depression, high education, and low education groups, respectively. Interpretation: Our algorithm is a sound basis for culturally and educationally sensitive dementia diagnosis in clinical and population-based research, supported by translations of its constituent measures into most languages used in the developing world.

0037983831	Antidepressants for the treatment of neuropathic pain	Tricyclic antidepressants have been the mainstay treatment modality of neuropathic pain. However, use of these agents has been limited by their significant side effects and potential cardiac adverse events, particularly in overdose. Newer antidepressants have been shown to have better safety profiles and tolerability. This article examines current evidence of the use of newer antidepressants in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The proposed mechanisms of action, clinical evidence and tolerability were reviewed. Although tricyclic antidepressants appear to be the most efficacious agents for neuropathic pain, there is inadequate evidence supporting their prolonged use. Paroxetine, trazodone, nefazodone, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine are potentially useful agents, but these drugs can also produce treatment-limiting side effects.

A total of 1,925 subjects who were 65 years and older, ethnic Chinese, and community-living, with no history of cerebrovascular accidents or dementia, were recruited. Demographics, medical history, and physical parameters recorded at baseline were retrieved for analysis. Primary outcome was SCI developed in 6 years, which was defined by the presence of clinical dementia, scoring below the cutoff point on the Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination, and/or a global Clinical Dementia Rating of 1 to 3.

Method: A sample of 263 subjects was recruited in Mianyang and interviewed using standardized instruments. Basic socio-demographic and clinical data were collected. Results: The expected mean total sleep time (TST) of the whole sample was 6.8 ± 2.2 hours, and the actual mean TST was 6.3 ± 2.1 hours. The 1-year prevalence of at least one type of insomnia was 7.6%; the rates of DIS, DMS, and EMA were 5.7%, 7.2%, and 6.8%, respectively. On multivariate analyses, female sex and psychiatric disorders were independently associated with more frequent insomnia. Conclusion: Insomnia is not uncommon in older adults in rural China, and the low percentage of subjects treated suggests that improved access to treatment might be indicated. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis.

84885423013	Prevalence of psychological symptoms in contemporary Chinese rural-to-urban migrant workers: An exploratory meta-analysis of observational studies using the SCL-90-R	Purpose: (1) To estimate the pooled prevalence of psychological symptoms in Chinese migrant workers (CMWs), as measured using the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R) in observational studies conducted in China, and (2) to explore the potential variables associated with the SCL-90-R Global Severity Index (GSI), the overall mental health indicator of CMWs. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search of the major English and Chinese databases (to June 2012). Cross-sectional surveys and case-control studies of CMWs (and controls where appropriate) that reported at least one subscale score of the SCL-90-R were included. Multilevel meta-analysis was used to pool the symptom scores of cross-sectional surveys and mean differences of symptom scores ("Cohen's d" values) between CMWs and controls of case-control studies. Multilevel meta-analysis with ecological- or study-level covariates was used to explore the associations between variables and SCL-90-R GSI score. Results: The search yielded 48 cross-sectional surveys (comprising 42,813 CMWs) and seven surveys that included control samples. The pooled psychological symptom scores (95 % confidence interval) of CMWs were statistically higher than those of norms from Chinese general population on all scales of SCL-90-R, except for obsessive-compulsive subscale in study quality subgroup analysis. CMWs also scored statistically higher than those of urban counterpart controls on all scales of SCL-90-R. Multilevel regression meta-analysis model revealed that four covariates that accounted for 33.9 % of SCL-90-R GSI heterogeneity across all surveys, including: "mean age of study sample," "geographic area," "per capita GDP," and "statutory minimum monthly wage" of study site in implementation year. Conclusion: CMWs have more severe psychological symptoms than the general population, and thus, appear to experience higher level of psychological distress. Macro-economic factors may have impact on the overall mental health of CMWs, but the factors that contribute to mental health and mental distress among CMWs remain to be explored and understood. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84885128798	Detection of malingering: Psychometric evaluation of the Chinese version of the structured interview of reported symptoms-2	Background: Malingering detection has emerged as an important issue in clinical and forensic settings. The Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms-2 (SIRS-2) was designed to assess the feigned symptoms in both clinical and non-clinical subjects. The aim of the study was to examine the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of this scale.Methods: Two studies were conducted to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese Version of SIRS-2. In Study one, with a simulation design, the subjects included a. 40 students asked to simulate symptoms of mental illness; b. 40 general psychiatric inpatients and c. 40 students asked to reply to questions honestly. Scales scores for feigning symptoms among three groups were carried out for discriminant validity of the Chinese Version of SIRS-2. Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2(MMPI-2) was administered in 80 undergraduate students. In Study two, with a known-groups comparison design, scales scores for feigning symptoms were compared between 20 suspected malingerers and 80 psychiatric outpatients from two forensic centers using the Chinese Version of SIRS-2.Results: The Chinese Version of SIRS-2 demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency in both study one and two. In study one, criterion validity of this scale was supported by its significantly positive correlation with the MMPI-2 (r = 0.282 ~ 0.481 for Infrequency), and by its significantly negative correlation with the MMPI-2 (r = -0.255 ~ -0.519 for Lie and -0.205 ~ 0.391 for Correction). Scores of 10 out of 13 subscales of the Chinese Version of SIRS-2 for simulators were significantly higher than scores of honest students and general psychiatric patients. In study two, the mean scores of the Chinese Version of 13 subscales for suspected malingerers were significantly higher than those of psychiatric outpatients. For discriminant validity, it yielded a large effect size (d = 1.80) for the comparison of the participant groups in study one and two. Moreover, the sensitivity (proportion of malingerers accurately identified by the measure) and specificity (proportion of people accurately classified as responding honestly) of the Chinese version of SIRS-2 in the detection of malingering in these two studies are acceptable.Conclusions: The Chinese version of the SIRS-2 has good psychometric properties and is a valid and reliable tool for detection of malingering in Chinese populations. © 2013 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0141429129	A randomised controlled trial of educational counselling on the management of women who have suffered suboptimal outcomes in pregnancy	Objectives: To study whether proactive educational counselling, in addition to routine clinical care, reduces psychological morbidity and improves quality of life and client satisfaction among women who suffer suboptimal outcomes during childbirth. Design: A randomised controlled trial. Setting: Obstetric unit of a tertiary teaching hospital. Population: Women who had unexpected antenatal, intrapartum or postpartum events leading to suboptimal outcomes during pregnancy and childbirth. Intervention: Educational counselling provided by a trained research nurse in the postnatal ward after delivery. Women in the control group received routine clinical care. Main outcome measures: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the General Health Questionnaire and the Clinical Global Impression (before and after counselling, at six weeks and six months post-delivery) and the World Health Organisation Quality of Life scale (WHO-QOL) (at six weeks and six months post-delivery). Results: There was no significant difference in psychological morbidity, quality of life or client satisfaction between the counselling group and the control group. Participants who underwent elective caesarean section and who had the educational counselling had significantly lower depression scores [mean 2.6 (SD 2.6)] compared with those receiving routine care [mean 3.9 (SD 3.2)]. On the other hand, educational counselling may have deleterious effect to women's quality of life in those who had instrumental delivery. Participants allocated to the counselling group had a lower mean score 68 (SD 13) in the physical domain of WHO-QOL than those in the intervention group 74 (SD 13). Conclusion: Educational counselling, given on top of routine clinical care, does not give additional beneficial effects on the psychological wellbeing and quality of life of women who encountered suboptimal outcomes during pregnancy.

0141505030	Lack of association of the interleukin-1β gene polymorphism with Alzheimer's disease in a Chinese Population	Over the past few years, a number of genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been proposed. IL-1β gene polymorphism such as IL-1β-511 and IL-1β+3953 have been reported to be associated with the risk of AD in a number of studies in a Caucasian population. However, conflicting results have been reported recently which showed that IL-1βwas not universally associated with the risk of AD in other populations. In order to validate these associations, we investigated the IL-1βpolymorphisms (IL-1β-31, IL-1β-511 and IL-1β+3953) in a Chinese population, which has not been studied before. In our study, the allelic frequencies of IL-1β-31C, IL-1β-511T and IL-1β+3953T for the AD group were 0.49, 0.57 and 0.03, respectively. The allelic frequencies of IL-1β-31C, IL-1β-511T and IL-1β+3953T for the control group were 0.53, 0.61 and 0.03, respectively. No significant difference was detected in the genotypic or allelic frequencies (p > 0.25). We conclude that IL-1βpolymorphism is unlikely to be a significant risk factor for AD in the Chinese Population. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

84900809148	Insomnia in older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Hong Kong: A case-control study	This study aimed to determine the frequency and sociodemographic/clinical correlates of insomnia in Chinese patients aged ≥60 years suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this case-control study of 142 outpatients with COPD and 218 sex- and age-matched control subjects, COPD patients were recruited from a prospective study sample hospitalized in Hong Kong for acute COPD exacerbation (≥2 major COPD symptoms or >1 major+minor COPD symptoms for ≥2 consecutive days). Controls were recruited from social centres in Hong Kong. Activity of daily living was assessed with the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, life events were evaluated using the Life Event Scale, depressive symptoms were ascertained with the Geriatric Depression Scale, and quality of life was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12. Early, middle and late insomnia were measured using items 4, 5 and 6 of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The frequency of ≥1 type of insomnia was 47.2% in patients and 25.7% in controls; frequencies of early, middle and late insomnia in patients were 24.6%, 31.0%, and 26.1%, respectively, compared to 14.7%, 14.7% and 11.9% in controls. Group differences were non-significant after controlling for relevant covariates. However, in multiple logistic regression analysis, more physical illnesses (p = 0.02, OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1-1.7) and more severe depressive symptoms (p = 0.009, OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.03-1.3) were independently associated with any type of insomnia in COPD patients, accounting for 21.3% of the variance. A significant proportion of older adult Chinese COPD patients suffer from insomnia that warrants more attention in clinical practice. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

84901500767	Depressive disorders in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Hong Kong: A controlled study	Objective: There have been few studies examining the relationship between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and psychiatric morbidity in Hong Kong. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of depressive disorders (major depression, dysthymia and adjustment disorder with depressed mood) in Chinese patients with COPD and explore their demographic and clinical correlates.Method: A total of 146 patients aged 50 years and above with COPD and 220 age and gender matched control subjects without COPD formed the study sample. Data of demographic and clinical characteristics were collected by a form designed for this study. Activity of daily living was assessed by the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale and life events were evaluated by the Life Event Scale. Depressive disorders were determined using the Chinese version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV.Results: The point prevalence of DSM-IV depressive disorders in patients with COPD and controls were 15.1% and 3.6%, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that female sex and severe impairment in daily activity functioning were independently associated with depressive disorders. Only 22.7% of the depressed COPD patients had consulted psychiatrists in the past three months.Conclusion: Depressive disorders are significantly higher in COPD patients than controls. The low percentage of depressed patients with COPD seeking psychiatric treatment suggests that there is an unmet need in the psychiatric care of COPD patients. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

10744221093	Care arrangements for people with dementia in developing countries	Background: Rapid demographic ageing will soon lead to large increases in the numbers of persons with dementia in developing countries. This study is the first comprehensive assessment of care arrangements for people with dementia in those regions. Methods: A descriptive and comparative study of dementia care; caregiver characteristics, the nature of care provided, and the practical, psychological (Zarit Burden Interview, General Health Questionnaire) and economic impact upon the caregiver in 24 centres in India, China and South East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa. Results: We interviewed 706 persons with dementia, and their caregivers. Most caregivers were women, living with the person with dementia in extended family households. One-quarter to one-half of households included a child. Larger households were associated with lower caregiver strain, where the caregiver was co-resident. However, despite the traditional apparatus of family care, levels of caregiver strain were at least as high as in the developed world. Many had cutback on work to care and faced the additional expense of paid carers and health services. Families from the poorest countries were particularly likely to have used expensive private medical services, and to be spending more than 10% of the per capita GNP on health care. Conclusions: Older people in developing countries are indivisible from their younger family members. The high levels of family strain identified in this study feed into the cycle of disadvantage and should thus be a concern for policymakers in the developing world.

12844278641	Factors associated with psychosis among patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: A case-control study	We observed that a number of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) developed affective psychosis during the acute phase of their illness. We reviewed all SARS-related psychiatric consultations in Hong Kong and investigated the risk factors for psychosis among patients with SARS in a matched case-control study. Patients with SARS-related psychosis received higher total doses of steroids and had higher rates of family history of psychiatric illness. The findings of the present study suggest that steroid toxicity, personal vulnerability, and, probably, psychosocial stressors jointly contributed to the development of psychosis in patients with SARS.

1342347799	Alzheimer Disease International's 10/66 Dementia Research Group - One model for action research in developing countries	Background: The 10/66 Dementia Research Group (10/66) founded in 1998, is a network of over 100 researchers from mainly developing countries. 10/66 is committed to encourage more good quality research in those regions, where an estimated two-thirds of all those with dementia live. It represents a collaboration of academics, clinicians, and an international non-governmental organization, Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI). Method: 10/66 pilot studies in 26 centres in Latin America, India, Africa and China and SE Asia suggest that education and culture-fair diagnosis is an attainable aim. Despite extended family care networks, these studies also identified high levels of practical, psychological and economic strain upon caregivers. Population-based studies in six centres will now estimate prevalence, describe impact and seek to identify genetic and environmental risk factors in novel settings. At a practical level, 10/66 has studied ways to circumvent the lack of help-seeking in developing countries, and has developed a low-level intervention to educate and train caregivers. Conclusion: The links with ADI and its international networks, and the volunteerism of ADIs members have fostered the rapid growth of 10/66. The partnership facilitates both the raising of awareness and influence upon policy, as 10/66 research evidence can be used by ADI and national Alzheimer's Associations to direct and support advocacy.
