2442513982	Variation and effect of phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in reliving pain by electro-acupuncture at jianji acupoint in adjuvant-induced arthritis rats	Aim: To observe the influence of electro-acupuncture(EA) at jiaji acupoint on the expression of phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (phospho-p38MAPK) in dorsal root ganglion(DRG) of adjuvant-induced arthritis rats and to study the mechanism of electro-acupuncture for analgesia from the view of signal transducer. Methods: Complete Freund's adjuvant(CFA) was injected into posterior left foot pad to establish analgesia models of adjuvant-induced arthritis rats. Immunohistochemical technique was used to check the characteristics of phospho-p38MAPK expression in SD rat DRG of the control, model and electro-acupuncture treatment group. Results: Compared with that of the control group[(7.65 ± 0.72) s], the pain thresholds of the model group decreased at 24, 48 hours and 7 days after model establishment, which were(6.67 ± 0.59) s, (6.53 ± 0.73) s and (6.64 ± 0.76) s respectively. Simultaneously, the level of phospho-p38MAPK increased(P < 0.05), which increased significantly 48 h after model establishment. After electro-acupuncture at jiaji acupoint, the pain thresholds of the treatment group had a tendency to increase, which were (7.31 ± 0.79) s, (7.42 ± 0.93) s and (7.44 ± 0.89) s respectively at 24, 48 hours and 7 days after treatment. And the level of phospho-p38MAPK decreased(P < 0.05). Conclusion: p38MAPK may be one important element for signal transducer, and its phosphorylation plays an important role during electro-acupuncture analgesia.

33751099074	Analysis of the dissociated steroid RU24858 does not exclude a role for inducible genes in the anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids	Although repression of inflammatory gene expression makes glucocorticoids powerful anti-inflammatory agents, side effects limit usage and drive the search for improved glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligands. In A549 pulmonary cells, dexamethasone and the prototypical dissociated ligand RU24858 (Mol Endocrinol 11:1245-1255, 1997) repress interleukin (IL)-1β-induced expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and IL-8. Although RU24858 is a weaker GR ligand, both glucocorticoids showed similar efficacies on transrepression of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent transcription, whereas RU24858 yielded less than 12% of the response to dexamethasone on a classic glucocorticoid response element (GRE) reporter (transactivation). Modest NF-κB-dependent transrepression (∼40%), along with analysis of IL-8 transcription rate and the accumulation of unspliced nuclear RNA, indicates that transrepression does not fully account for the repression of genes such as IL-8. This was confirmed by the finding that mRNA degradation is increased by both dexamethasone and RU24858. Analysis of IL-1β-induced steady-state mRNA levels for IL-8 and COX-2 show that dexamethasone- and RU24858-dependent repression of these genes is attenuated by inhibitors of transcription and protein synthesis. Because similar effects were observed with respect to COX-2 and IL-8 protein expression, we conclude that glucocorticoid-dependent gene expression is necessary for repression by both glucocorticoids. Despite RU24858 being defective at classic GRE-dependent transactivation, both dexamethasone and RU24858 induced the expression of potentially anti-inflammatory genes and metabolic genes, suggesting the importance of nontraditional glucocorticoid-dependent gene expression. Thus, classic transactivation- and transrepression-based screens for anti-inflammatory "dissociated" GR ligands may be flawed because they may not reflect the effects on real glucocorticoid-inducible genes.

33846781461	sBAFF mutants induce neutralizing antibodies against BAFF	B cell activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) is a novel member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family and plays an important role in B lymphocyte maturation and survival. Overexpression of BAFF is closely involved in the pathogenesis and progression of many kinds of autoimmune disorders; therefore, BAFF has been considered as an ideal therapeutic target for these conditions. In this study, we generated several candidate immune inhibitors of human BAFF by conjugating foreign immunodominant T-helper cell (Th) epitopes to the N- or C-terminus of five BAFF mutants. The recombined proteins were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. BALB/c mice immunized with the recombinant proteins produced high levels of anti-BAFF antibodies, and their sera inhibited the lymphocyte proliferation-inducing activity of recombinant soluble BAFF and natural soluble BAFF. Moreover, antibodies cross-reactive with BAFF were detected in sera from hu-SCID mice immunized with the recombinant proteins. These results indicated that the recombinant BAFF mutants modified with Th epitopes could induce neutralizing antibodies against BAFF in vivo. This study may provide a valuable strategy for treating BAFF-associated autoimmune diseases. © 2007 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

33947161510	Isolation and differentiation of embryonic stem cells from BALB/c mouse	Objective: To invest the efficient method which can culture and induce embryonic stem cells to neurocyte in vitro. Methods: Isolate the blastula of 3.5 d from BALB/c species mouse. Culture the cells from inner cell mass (inner cell mass, ICM) which were isolated by mechanical method on the mouse embryonic fibroblaste cell (MEF) feeder layer or 0.1% gelatin coated dishes. The stem cells were identified by characterized morphology, alkaline phosphatase stain, differential potency in vivo and immunochemistry stain. The isolated cells were differentiated by serial induction method that mimicking the intrinsic developmental process of the neural system. Results: The isolated cells were positive for alkaline phosphatatse and SSEA-1 (stage specific embryonic antigen 1). Moreover they were identified pluripotent by differentiation in vivo. Therefore the isolated cells presented the characters of ESCs. Then the isolated cells were able to differentiate into neurocytes in vitro. Conclusion: Mouse embryonic stem cells isolation, culture and differentiation system has been established.

34248328368	CCL2/CCR2 pathway mediates recruitment of myeloid suppressor cells to cancers	In addition to direct effect on tumor cells, the tumor-promoting activity of CCL2 has been ascribed to its role in chemoattracting tumor-associated macrophages. However it is unclear whether CCL2 also attracts other immune regulatory cells during tumor development. In this study, we confirmed the ubiquitous expression of CCR2 in myeloid suppressor cells (MSCs), a main inducer for tumor immune evasion, and identified that cancer patient-derived CCL2 mediated the migration of MSCs to tumors in vitro, which could be interdicted by antibodies neutralizing CCL2 or blocking CCR2. In mouse tumor model, the adoptively transferred CCR2

34347337712	Preparation of recombinant protein DsbA-G1F/M2 of respiratory syncytial virus and its immunogenicity	OBJECTIVE: To establish a method for preparing recombinant protein DsbA-G1F/M2 of respiratory syncytial virus and to investigate its immunogenicity. METHODS: The G1 and F/M2 gene fragments were amplified by PCR method and then ligated into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-DsbA after being digested by corresponding endonucleases. The recombinant plasmid pET-DsbA-G1F/M2 was transferred into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and the expression of the molecule was induced by IPTG. The inclusion degenerated in urea solution was purified by affinity chromatography, renatured by gradient dialysis, and characterized by Westernblot. DsbA-G1F/M2 was used to immune BALB/c mice. Anti-RSV antibody was measured by ELISA and RSV-specific CTL responses by MTT. RESULTS: The recombinant expression plasmid successfully expressed RSV specific fusion protein in E. col BL21 (DE3). The purity of the fusion protein was over 90% after being purified by affinity chromatography and renatured. The protein induced high level anti-RSV antibody titers and RSV-specific CTL responses. CONCLUSION: The processing above can be a scheme to obtain the high purity and RSV specific recombinant protein DsbA-G1F/M2.

34748908970	Long-lasting balanced immunity and protective efficacy against respiratory syncytial virus in mice induced by a recombinant protein G1F/M2	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the primary cause of serious lower respiratory tract illness in young children. We have engineered a recombinant candidate vaccine G1F/M2, consisting of a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope of RSV-M2 protein and a domain of RSV-G protein. In this study, the long-term immunogenicity and protective effect were evaluated. In G1F/M2-immunized mice, special antibodies lasted for more than 19 weeks, and the IgG1/IgG2a ratio remained a balanced level till the end of the study, suggesting mixed Th1/Th2 type of responses. Concomitantly, G1F/M2 elicited long-lived RSV-specific CTL activity that was detectable at 12 weeks after the final immunization. Stronger CTL responses were induced with immunization once more at 13 weeks after the last immunization in G1F/M2-primed mice than those in F/M2-primed mice. These results suggest that G1F/M2-induced long-lasting balanced humoral and cellular immunity responses, and immunological memory in mice. Furthermore, following RSV challenge, long-term protective efficacy was observed. RSV replication in lungs of G1F/M2-primed mice elicited also mixed Th1/Th2 responses, a property that is considered advantageous for the safety of an RSV vaccine. Therefore, G1F/M2 is a promising RSV subunit vaccine. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

38049074892	Recombinant CBD-HepII polypeptide of fibronectin inhibits αvβ3 signaling and hematogenous metastasis of tumor	The interaction of integrin αvβ3 and its ligands are crucial for tumor metastasis. Recombinant CBD-HepII polypeptide of fibronectin, designated as CH50, suppressed the binding of tumor cells to ECM molecules, and abolished the promoting effect of soluble fibronectin and fibrinogen on tumor cell adhesion to ECM molecules. The underlying mechanisms involve the blockade and downregulation of αvβ3 and its co-receptor syndecan 1 by CH50. The activation of FAK, upregulation of cdc2, the production and activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by ECM molecules-stimulated tumor cells were inhibited by CH50. CH50 reduced the tumor cell arrest during blood flow, and also inhibited the invasive ability of tumor cells. The in vivo expressed CH50 suppressed the lung metastasis of circulating tumor cells, and prolonged the survival of mice after tumor cell inoculation. These findings suggest a prospective utility of CH50 in the gene therapy for prevention of tumor metastasis. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

34248579634	Inhibition of hepatocarcinoma and tumor metastasis to liver by gene therapy with recombinant CBD-HepII polypeptide of fibronectin	Unlike the intact fibronectin (FN) molecule, some proteolytic or recombinant fragments of FN possess inhibitory activities on tumor, providing potential strategies in tumor therapeutics. Using the hydrodynamics-based gene delivery technique, we demonstrated that the treatment by in vivo expression of a recombinant CBD-HepII polypeptide of FN, designated as CH50, strongly inhibited the tumor growth, tumor invasion and angiogenesis. Such inhibitory effects of CH50 on tumor were partly ascribed to its influence on the activities of MMP-9 and αvβ3 integrin. The in vivo expressed CH50 decreased both the production and the activity of MMP-9 in tumor tissues. CH50 also down-regulated αvβ3 expression in tumor cells and endothelial cells in vitro. The decreased activity of αvβ3 integrin was proved by its reduced binding ability to fibrinogen and the down-regulation of cdc2 expression. The gene therapy with CH50 not only prolonged the survival of mice bearing hepatocarcinoma in the liver, but also suppressed the growth and invasive ability of tumor in spleen and its metastasis to liver. Taken together, these findings suggest a prospective utility of CH50 in the gene therapy of liver cancer. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

34250156711	Soluble PD-1 facilitates 4-1BBL - Triggered antitumor immunity against murine H22 hepatocarcinoma in vivo	Purpose: The use of costimulatory molecules targeting distinct T-cell signaling pathways has provided a means for triggering and enhancing antitumor immunity; however, it is still not fully understood what types of costimulatory molecules are suitable for the combination in tumor therapy. Our purpose in this study is to establish an effective antitumor immune approach by using costimulatory molecule 4-1BBL in combination with soluble PD-1. Experimental Design: The murine H22 hepatocarcinoma served as an ectopic tumor model. Local gene transfer was done by injection with naked plasmid p4-1BBL and/or psPD-1. The synergistic mechanism of dual-gene therapy was elucidated by detecting the change of gene expression of immunoregulatory factors in tumor microenvironment. The effects of immunotherapy were evaluated by testing the function of tumor-specific T cells, measuring tumor weight or volume, survival of mice, and H&E staining of tissues. Results: 4-1BBL expressed by normal nonimmune cells effectively enhanced antitumor immune response but up-regulated PD-L1 and did not reduce IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). sPD-1 synergized with 4-1BBL to establish efficient antitumor immune environment, including down-regulation of IL-10 and TGF-β, further up-regulation of interleukin (IL)-2 and IFN-γ, and higher CD8

80052682255	Killing effect of sodium abietate on adult worms of Schistosoma japonicum in vitro	Objective: To observe the killing effect of sodium abietate on adult male and female worms of Schistosoma japonicum in vitro. Methods: The mice infected with cercariae of S. japonicum were sacrificed and perfused five weeks later, the adult worms obtained by the portal perfusion method, were cultivated in DMEM medium containing different concentrations of sodium abietate for 3 days, except the controls, then the worms were observed for the death and motility reducing. The worms were stained by hydrochloric acid carmine for the detection of the changes, and the protein of the worms was detected by using the ultraviolet ray-absorption and Bradford method. Result: After the treatment of sodium abietate, the mortality and motility reducing rate of adult worms were higher significantly than the controls; the effect of sodium abietate on male worms was more obvious than on female worms. The male worms' intestinal canal enlarged and appeared black or brown bands or spots after the treatment. The contents of the intestine of female worms were distributed asymmetrically, and the shape of some worms ' ovaries was anomalism and the coloring was asymmetrical. Compared with the control group, the protein of adult male and female worms were reduced (P<0.05). Conclusion: Sodium abietate could kill adult worms of S. japonicum in vitro. It may affect the protein metabolism of the worms.

84861555163	FXR ligands protect against hepatocellular inflammation via SOCS3 induction	Because of the anti-inflammatory actions of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists, FXR has received much attention as a potential therapeutic target. However, the molecular mechanisms of actions have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we reported that in the animal model of LPS-induced liver injury, administration of the FXR natural ligand CDCA could attenuate hepatocyte inflammatory damage, reduce transaminase activities, suppress inflammation mediators (IL-6, TNF-α and ICAM-1) expression and inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation. These protective effects of FXR were accompanied by an increased expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which is a negative feedback regulator of cytokine-STAT3 signaling. We then demonstrated that the beneficial effects of FXR agonist in STAT3 activation were weakened by small interfering RNA-mediated SOCS3 knockdown in hepacytes. Moreover we observed both natural ligand CDCA and synthetic ligand GW4064 could upregulate SOCS 3 expression by enhancing the promoter activity in hepatocytes. These results suggest modulation of SOCS3 expression may represent a novel mechanism through which FXR activation could selectively affect cytokine bioactivity in inflammation response. FXR ligands may be potentially therapeutic in the treatment of liver inflammatory diseases via SOCS3 induction. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84866598579	HDAC1/DNMT3A-containing complex is associated with suppression of oct4 in cervical cancer cells	Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), an important embryonic transcriptional factor, is highly expressed in several tumors and is considered as a hallmark of cancer stem cells. Knowledge about the expression and regulatory mech- anisms of Oct4 can contribute to the treatment of cancers. As for cervical cancer, however, details remain obscure about Oct4 expression and its regulatory mechanism. In this study, we found that the level of Oct4 in human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16)- positive cervical cancer cells (CaSki cells) was higher than that in HPV-negative cervical cancer cells (C-33A cells), whereas both the level of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) were lower in CaSki cells than those in C-33A cells. Treatment with valproic acid, an HDAC inhibitor, could significantly increase the expression of Oct4 in C-33A cells, but only slightly increased Oct4 in CaSki cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that HDAC1 and DNMT3A existed in a common complex. The co-immunoprecipitated DNMT3A or HDAC1 was dose- dependently decreased with valproic acid treatment. These results indicated that HDAC1/DNMT3A-containing complex is associated with the suppression of Oct4 in cervical cancer cells, and the activity of HDAC1 is required in the repression of Oct4. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2012.

84866687176	Radiofrequency Ablation versus Resection for Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases: A Meta-Analysis	Background: No randomized controlled trial (RCT) has yet been performed to provide the evidence to clarify the therapeutic debate on liver resection (LR) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating colorectal liver metastases (CLM). The meta-analysis was performed to summarize the evidence mostly from retrospective clinical trials and to investigate the effect of LR and RFA. Methodology/Principal Findings: Systematic literature search of clinical studies was carried out to compare RFA and LR for CLM in Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane Library Central databases. The meta-analysis was performed using risk ratio (RR) and random effect model, in which 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for RR were calculated. Primary outcomes were the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 and 5 years plus mortality and morbidity. 1 prospective study and 12 retrospective studies were finally eligible for meta-analysis. LR was significantly superior to RFA in 3 -year OS (RR 1.377, 95% CI: 1.246-1.522); 5-year OS (RR: 1.474, 95%CI: 1.284-1.692); 3-year DFS (RR 1.735, 95% CI: 1.483-2.029) and 5-year DFS (RR 2.227, 95% CI: 1.823-2.720). The postoperative morbidity was higher in LR (RR: 2.495, 95% CI: 1.881-3.308), but no significant difference was found in mortality between LR and RFA. The data from the 3 subgroups (tumor<3 cm; solitary tumor; open surgery or laparoscopic approach) showed significantly better OS and DFS in patients who received surgical resection. Conclusions/Significances: Although multiple confounders exist in the clinical trials especially the bias in patient selection, LR was significantly superior to RFA in the treatment of CLM, even when conditions limited to tumor<3 cm, solitary tumor and open surgery or laparoscopic (lap) approach. Therefore, caution should be taken when treating CLM with RFA before more supportive evidences for RFA from RCTs are obtained. © 2012 Weng et al.

84887722304	Chronic inhibition of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase 5 suppresses endoplasmic reticulum stress in heart failure	Background and Purpose Inhibition of the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) exerts profound beneficial effects on failing hearts. However, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of PDE5 inhibition on heart failure are unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether PDE5 inhibition decreases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a key event in heart failure. Experimental Approach Heart failure was induced by isoprenaline s.c. injection in Sprague-Dawley rats and transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice. PDE5 was inhibited with sildenafil. Heart function was detected by invasive pressure-volume analysis and echocardiography. ER stress markers were analysed by Western blotting. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometric analysis. Key Results PDE5 inhibition markedly attenuated isoprenaline-induced and TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction, and reduced ER stress and apoptosis. Further, PDE5 inhibition with sildenafil largely prevented ER stress and reduced apoptosis in isoprenaline- or thapsigargin-treated cardiomyocytes. PKG inhibition markedly prevented the protective effects of sildenafil in vivo and in vitro. To further understand the mechanism of the effect of PDE5 inhibition on ER stress, we demonstrated that PDE5 inhibitor increased sarco-(endo)-plasmic reticulum Ca

At first, the two-dimensional flow field in the flow passage was simulated from the angle of the numerical simulation with the data indicating the aerodynamic loss characteristics of the numerical simulation being obtained. Then, the aerodynamic loss characteristics of the guide blades in the inertia stage were tested. The analytic results of the numerical simulation and the experimental study show that at various flow speeds at the inlet, both total pressure losses will approximately assume a linear relationship and the aerodynamic resistance loss coefficients basically remain unchanged, however, there exist a certain deviation between them. Finally, the causes for such a deviation existing between them were analyzed and identified.

Method: Totally 44 patients with acute respiratory infection were divided into three groups according to various concentration of serum apolipoprotein A-I. They were procalcitonin(PCT) < 0.5 ng/ml group, 0.5 ng/ml ≤ PCT< 2 ng/ml group and PCT ≥2 ng/ml group. We measured apolipoprotein A-I, C-reactive, protein, procalcitonin and albumin within 24 hours after admission. Results: With the increase of serum PCT, the production of ApoA-I and albumin were down-regulated, while CRP up-regulated. Conclusions: Apolipoprotein A-I has a sound relationship with the acute respiratory infection. It can be used as one of the diagnostic criteria in severe infection patients who have disorders of lipometabolism.

46049093399	IFN-γ withdrawal after immunotherapy potentiates B16 melanoma invasion and metastasis by intensifying tumor integrin αvβ3 signaling	Immunotherapy can effectively suppress tumor, yet complete tumor eradication occurs infrequently. The metastatic potential of remnant tumor cells after immunotherapy and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that the termination of immunotherapy strikingly increases the metastatic potential of remnant melanoma. This is mainly due to the withdrawal of IFN-γ after immunotherapy. The relief of IFN-γ stress led to the increase of αvβ3 integrin expression in B16 cells, which increased the adhesion of B16 cells to fibrinogen, fibronectin and laminin. Through αvβ3 signaling, the activation of FAK, upregulation of cdc2, production of active MMP-2 and MMP-9 and actin polymerization were intensified in B16 cells stimulated with ECM molecules 24 h after the withdrawal of IFN-γ. The i.v. injection of such tumor cells into mice resulted in more metastatic tumor nodes in lung and shortened the survival of mice. The pitfall of immunotherapy termination can be remedied by the administration of recombinant CBD-HepII polypeptide of fibronectin, which effectively inhibits αvβ3 signaling. These findings suggest that the risk of tumor metastasis can be increased after the termination of immunotherapy, due to the withdrawal of IFN-γ and that targeting αvβ3 signaling pathway can improve the therapeutic effect of immunotherapeutic approaches by reducing such metastatic risk. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

45449083220	Upregulation of decorin by FXR in vascular smooth muscle cells	Decorin is a member of the family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans that are present in blood vessels and synthesized by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Decorin plays complex roles in both normal vascular physiology and the pathogenesis of various types of vascular disorders. However, the mechanisms of regulation of decorin expression in vasculature are not clearly understood. Particularly little information is available about a role of nuclear receptors in the regulation of decorin expression. In the present study, we report that activation of vascular FXR by a specific ligand resulted in upregulation of decorin at the levels of both mRNA and protein. FXR appears to induce decorin expression at a transcriptional level because (1) upregulation of decorin mRNA expression was abolished by the treatment of a transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D; and (2) decorin promoter activity was significantly increased by activation of FXR. Functional analysis of human decorin promoter identified an imperfect inverted repeat DNA motif, IR8 (-2313TGGTCAtagtgtcaTGACCT-2294), as a likely FXR-responsive element that is involved in decorin regulation. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Then, in 24 h after radiation, the protein spectra of each cell line were measured by SELDI-TOF protein chip so that we could get the differentiated protein expressions of each cell line after different radiation doses. And the differentially-expressed protein peaks showing gradient change in a dose-dependent manner of the two cell lines were detected. Finally, GADD45B, Thioredoxin and Metallothionein 1 (MTl) were screened out through Swiss-Prot database as proteins highly related with radiosensitivity in colorectal cancer. The result shows that radiosensitivity in colorectal cancer can be predicted at protein level and SELDTTOF protein chip can be used to predict radiosensitivity in colorectal cancer at protein level, thus providing ample choices for individualized radiotherapy.

55649120647	Protective effect of a RSV subunit vaccine candidate G1F/M2 was enhanced by a HSP70-Like protein in mice	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major respiratory pathogen in newborns. Neonate vaccine should induce strong protective immunity. We have engineered a subunit vaccine candidate G1F/M2. A major problem in developing subunit vaccines is their limited immunogenicity. Aluminium adjuvants with a long history of use with routine childhood vaccines have some limitations, especially inability to elicit CTL response. There is a need for alternative adjuvants. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are characterized as potent immunoadjuvants. In this study, HSP70-like protein 1 (HSP70L1) gene was cloned. The recombinant protein HSP70L1 was expressed in E. coli, purified and renaturated. We evaluated the potential of HSP70L1 used as the adjuvant of G1F/M2. G1F/M2 was chemically cross-linked with HSP70L1 (HSP-G1F/M2). HSP70L1 enhanced significantly the immunogenicity and protective effect of G1F/M2. HSP-G1F/M2 induced significant higher levels of antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and CTL activity than unadjuvanted G1F/M2. The antibody titers induced by HSP-G1F/M2 were similar to that by G1F/M2 + Alum. RSV-specific CTL activity induced by HSP-G1F/M2 was stronger than that by G1F/M2 + Alum. Interestingly, the protective effect of HSP-G1F/M2 against RSV was significantly stronger than that of G1F/M2 + Alum. The results suggest that HSP70L1 is a potent adjuvant of G1F/M2. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The minimum amount of DNA detectable using the PCR assay was 0.8 pg, and the expected PCR product was amplified when DNA equivalent of 1.1 egg from feces was used as template. In the meantime, serum anti-worm IgG was examined by ELISA. ELISA gave positive results at 4-6 weeks post-infection depending on the cercarial doses. The parasite eggs were detected in feces at 7 weeks post-infection. In contrast, S. japonicum DNA was detected in sera at first week post-infection, and it became negative at 10 weeks post-treatment, whereas the anti-worm IgG was still at high levels at 23 weeks post-treatment. These data demonstrated that the PCR assay established provides a potential tool for the early diagnosis and therapy evaluation for S. japonicum infection in humans. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

63849271900	Increased expression of β-catenin, phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3β, cyclin D1, and c-myc in laterally spreading colorectal tumors	Laterally spreading tumors (LSTs) are considered a special subtype of superficial colorectal tumor. This study was performed to characterize the clinicopathological features and examine activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in LSTs and protruded-type colorectal adenomas (PAs). Fifty LSTs and 54 PAs were collected, and their clinicopathological characteristics were compared. The expression of E-cadherin, β-catenin, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), phosphorylated GSK-3β, (phospho-GSK-3β), cyclin D1, and c-myc was investigated by immunohistochemical staining on serial sections. Patients with LSTs were significantly older than those bearing PAs (63.4 vs 47.4 years old; p<0.001). The mean size of LSTs was significantly larger than that of PAs (27.0 mm vs 14.6 mm; p<0.01). Forty-eight percent of LSTs were located in the proximal colon, which was significantly higher than that of PAs (18.5%; p<0.05). Expression of b-catenin, phospho-GSK-3β, cyclin D1, and c-myc was significantly increased in LSTs compared with PAs (p,0.05). However, E-cadherin and total GSK-3β expression was not significantly different between the two groups. The level of b-catenin expression correlated strongly with phospho-GSK-3β, cyclin D1, and c-myc expression in LSTs but not in PAs. Our findings suggest that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is more prevalent in LSTs than in PAs, suggesting that phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of GSK-3β may be involved in LST carcinogenesis. © The Histochemical Society, Inc.

Interestingly, we found that PAK5 was overexpressed in a variety of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cell lines in a Western-blotting examination. Therefore, in this study, we aim to examine the PAK5 expression during CRC progression and to answer if PAK5 is involved in malignant progression of CRC. By immunohistochemistry, our results showed that PAK5 expression was increased with CRC progression through the adenoma to carcinoma sequence, with the most significant increases in invasive and metastatic CRCs (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, increased PAK5 expression was also found with the development of CRC from lower Duke's grades to higher ones (p < 0.01). Moreover, PAK5 was also increased from well to poorly differentiated CRCs (p < 0.01). Using gain and loss of function experiments, we found that PAK5 reduced CRC cell adhesion but promoted their migration on collagen type I. Taken together, our study demonstrated that PAK5 expression increased significantly with malignant progression of CRC and that PAK5 might promote CRC metastasis by regulating CRC cell adhesion and migration. © 2009 UICC.

68149159339	β-Catenin expression is altered in dysplastic and nondysplastic aberrant crypt foci of human colon	PURPOSE: Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) of the colon are possible precursors of adenoma and cancer. β-catenin alterations are early events in human colorectal carcinogenesis. β-catenin expression is altered in colorectal cancer, adenoma, and ACF with dysplasia. Here, we describe the expression of β-catenin in ACF, especially nondysplastic ACF. METHODS: Rectal chromoscopy with 4% indigo carmine was performed on 418 subjects and 146 biopsy specimens, including 10 dysplastic ACF, 106 nondysplastic ACF, and 30 normal colonic mucosal controls taken under endoscopy. The expression and subcellular distribution of β-catenin were assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: β-catenin expression was altered in 1 of 30 (3.3%) normal mucosa, 30 of 106 (28.3%) nondysplastic ACF, and 10 of 10 (100%) dysplastic ACF (P<0.001). Notably, most cells with altered β-catenin expression in nondysplastic ACF were limited to the bottom of the crypt, where stem cells are located. CONCLUSIONS: Both dysplastic and nondysplastic ACF have altered β-catenin expression and play a role in colon tumorigenesis. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

70349694637	Amino acid residues 201-205 in C-terminal acidic tail region plays a crucial role in antibacterial activity of HMGB1	Background. Antibacterial activity is a novel function of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). However, the functional site for this new effect is presently unknown. Methods and Results. In this study, recombinant human HMGB1 A box and B box (rHMGB1 A box, rHMGB1 B box), recombinant human HMGB1 (rHMGB1) and the truncated C-terminal acidic tail mutant (tHMGB1) were prepared by the prokaryotic expression system. The C-terminal acidic tail (C peptide) was synthesized, which was composed of 30 amino acid residues. Antibacterial assays showed that both the full length rHMGB1 and the synthetic C peptide alone could efficiently inhibit bacteria proliferation, but rHMGB1 A box and B box, and tHMGB1 lacking the C-terminal acidic tail had no antibacterial function. These results suggest that C-terminal acidic tail is the key region for the antibacterial activity of HMGB1. Furthermore, we prepared eleven different deleted mutants lacking several amino acid residues in C-terminal acidic tail of HMGB1. Antibacterial assays of these mutants demonstrate that the amino acid residues 201-205 in C-terminal acidic tail region is the core functional site for the antibacterial activity of the molecule. Conclusion. In sum, these results define the key region and the crucial site in HMGB1 for its antibacterial function, which is helpful to illustrating the antibacterial mechanisms of HMGB1. © 2009 Gong et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

70350398582	Clinicopathologic features and endoscopic mucosal resection of laterally spreading tumors: Experience from China	Background: Laterally spreading tumors (LSTs) are being increasingly reported nowadays in Japan and the western countries with the application of magnification chromoendoscopy. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinicopathologic features of LSTs and to assess the outcome and safety of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in China. Patients and methods: One hundred nine patients with LSTs who underwent magnification chromoendoscopy were studied retrospectively. Clinicopathological features of 111 LSTs were analyzed. The efficacy and safety of EMR was assessed in 79 LSTs based on the outcome of follow-up colonoscopy and resection-related complications. Results: A total of 111 LSTs were diagnosed in 109 patients, including 89 (80%) laterally spreading tumor-granular (LST-G) type and 22 (20%) laterally spreading tumor-non-granular (LST-NG) type. There was significant difference in the dominant pit pattern between LST-G type and LST-NG type (p < 0.001). Type IV pit pattern (62%) was the main crypt pattern in LST-G type; whereas, type IIIL (50%) and type V pit pattern (36%) were predominant crypt patterns in LST-NG type. EMR was performed for 103 lesions. Six of the nine lesions with type V

77449125362	Two Gln187 mutants of human soluble APRIL inhibit proliferation of lung carcinoma A549 cells	Soluble APRIL (sAPRIL), the active form of a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), is implicated in the proliferation of tumor cells. Suppressing APRIL function has been considered as a potential strategy for the therapy of APRIL-associated tumors. In the present study, we generated human sAPRIL and its two mutants, Gln187-D-sAPRIL (Gln187 deleted) and Gly187-sAPRIL (Gln187 replaced by Gly). In vitro experiments showed that the two mutants had similar specific binding capacity to lung carcinoma A549 cells compared to the wild-type sAPRIL, and both, especially Gly187-sAPRIL, exhibited significant antagonistic effect on sAPRIL-induced tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, which might be predominantly mediated by blocking sAPRIL-induced MEK and ERK phosphorylation but not p38MAPK or JNK signaling. In vivo experiments with nude mice bearing A549 cell-derived xenograft tumor showed that only the Gly187-sAPRIL mutant could significantly suppress the tumor growth. These results suggest that Gln187 may be a crucial amino acid in APRIL-mediated tumor cell proliferation via the MEKERK signaling pathway and that the sAPRIL mutants may serve as novel potential antagonists of APRIL for the therapy of APRIL-associated cancers.

77950872531	Glucocorticoids inhibit IL-1β-induced GM-CSF expression at multiple levels: Roles for the ERK pathway and repression by MKP-1	In the present study, IL (interleukin)-1β increased GM-CSF (granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor) expression from pulmonary A549 cells and primary HBE (human bronchial epithelial) cells. These responses were repressed by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone, allowing the use of A549 cells as a relevant model. IL-1β induced GM-CSF release into the culture medium by 6 h and in cell lysates (cytosolic) at 2 h. These effects were profoundly inhibited by dexamethasone, yet IL-1β-induced GM-CSF mRNA and unspliced nRNA (nuclear RNA; a surrogate of transcription rate) were modestly inhibited by dexamethasone at times up to 2 h. Although this indicates an effect on protein synthesis, actinomycin D chase experiments also indicated post-transcriptional repression by dexamethasone. Dexamethasone-dependent mRNA repression increased with time and was prevented by translational blockade. In addition, dexamethasone and the dissociated steroid RU24858 repressed GM-CSF release in an actinomycin D-sensitive manner, thereby implicating glucocorticoid-induced gene expression. At 2 h, IL-1β-induced expression of GM-CSF protein, but not mRNA, was sensitive to the MEK [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) kinase] inhibitors PD098059 and U0126. Although this indicates a role for the MEK/ERK pathway in GM-CSF translation, PD098059 subsequently destabilized GM-CSF mRNA. Dexamethasone and RU24858 both reduced IL-1β-induced ERK phosphorylation and increased MKP-1 (MAPK phosphatase-1) expression. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation was reproduced by MKP-1 overexpression and prevented by MKP-1-targeting siRNA (small interfering RNA). Since MKP-1 prevented GM-CSF expression by transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational processes, we propose that glucocorticoids induce MKP-1 expression to reduce both MEK/ERK activation and GM-CSF protein synthesis. Thus de novo gene expression, particularly of MKP-1, is involved in the repressive effects of glucocorticoids. © The Authors.

77951673284	The anti-inflammatory activity of HMGB1 A box is enhanced when fused with C-terminal acidic tail	HMGB1, composed of the A box, B box, and C tail domains, is a critical proinflammatory cytokine involved in diverse inflammatory diseases. The B box mediates proinflammatory activity, while the A box alone acts as a specific antagonist of HMGB1. The C tail contributes to the spatial structure of A box and regulates HMGB1 DNA binding specificity. It is unknown whether the C tail can enhance the anti-inflammatory effect of A box. In this study, we generated fusion proteins consisting of the A box and C tail, in which the B box was deleted and the A box and C tail were linked either directly or by the flexible linker sequence (Gly

77951685908	Expression and purification of the fusion protein HMGB1Abox-TMD1, a novel HMGB1 antagonist	High mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) is a lethal mediator of systemic inflammation, and its A box domain is isolated as an antagonist of HMGB1. To enhance its expression level and its anti-HMGB1 effect, the A box cDNA was coupled with the sequence encoding lectin-like domain of thrombomodulin (TMD1). The fusion DNA frag- ment was ligated into the prokaryotic expression vector pQE-80L to construct the recombinant plasmid pQE80L-A/TMD1. The plasmid was then transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α, and the recombinant fusion protein A/TMD1 was expressed at 37°C for 4 h, with induction by IPTG at the final concentration of 0.2 mM. The expression level of the fusion protein was up to 40% of the total cellular protein. The fusion protein was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography and the purity was about 95%. After passing over a polymyxin B column to remove any contaminating lipopolysaccharides, the purified protein was tested for its anti-inflammatory activity. Our data show that A/TMD1 significantly inhibits HMGB1-induced TNF-α release and might be useful in treating HMGB1-elevated sepsis. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2010.

77956436169	The mechanisms of somatostatin induced enhanced chemosensitivity of gallbladder cancer cell line to doxorubicin: Cell cycle modulation plus target enzyme up-regulation	Background: Gallbladder carcinoma is known to be an aggressive malignancy and nonsensitive to routine chemotherapy. Its prognosis is quite poor. We have illustrated that somatostatin (SST) can enhance chemosensitivity of gallbladder cancer to Doxorubicin (DOX) in our precious studies. Here, we explored the possible mechanisms by which SST used to enhance the cytotoxicity of DOX on gallbladder carcinoma cell line. Methods: Human gallbladder cancer cells line (GBC-SD cell line) were divided into four groups: control group, SST group, DOX group, SST. +. DOX co-treated-group. Cell cycle was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). Cell apoptosis index was detected by using Annexin V/Propidium Iodide Binding on FCM. The expressions of certain key cell cycle-related factors, including retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and E2F-1 protein were investigated by western blotting. ICBP90 protein, which could be a new downstream effector of E2F-1, was also detected by western blotting. The expression of Topo IIα protein, target enzyme of DOX, was assessed in synchronized GBC-SD cells by western blotting. Results: After 24 h treatment with SST alone, cell cycle was arrested at S phase in GBC-SD cells line, followed by indistinctive increment of apoptosis index. After 24 h treatment with SST and DOX, apoptosis index significantly increased than that of DOX alone (P<0.05). Compared with control group, the expressions of Rb and E2F-1 protein were significantly up-regulated at 24 h after treatment with SST. Similarly, the expressions of ICBP90 and Topo IIα protein were also enhanced at 24 h after treatment with SST. Conclusion: These results suggested that SST could induce cell cycle block in S phase in GBC-SD cells line, the most sensitive phase of the cell cycle for DOX, through up-regulating Rb, E2F-1 and ICBP90 protein expression. Furthermore, ICBP90 induced the enhanced expression of Topo IIα protein which is the target enzyme of DOX and enhanced its cytotoxic effect on GBC-SD cells. We concluded that the mechanisms of SST enhanced chemosensitivity of GBC-SD cell line to DOX might be cell cycle arrest plus up-regulated target enzyme. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

77957868058	Investigation of adriamycin thermosensitive liposomes crossing the blood-brain barrier and blood-brain tumor barrier	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of thermosensitive liposomes loaded with adriamycin (ADM) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-brain tumor barrier (BTB) in vitro models. METHODS: ECV304 cells and astrocytes cells were co-cultivaled on the two sides of semi-permeable PET filter for establishing a BBB model. The cultivation of ECV304 cells on the filter and C6 cells on the bottom of the plate generated a BTB model. The function of the two models were assessed by using the trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER). The penetration efficiency of adriamycin and thermosensitive liposomes adriamycin across BBB and BTB at 37°C and 42°C was tested respectively. RESULTS: The value of TEER of BBB model was higher than that for BTB model under the same condition. Adriamycin penetrated across BTB more effectively than BBB. The adriamycin thermosensitive liposomes penetrated across either BBB or BTB more effectively than adriamycin alone at 42°C. CONCLUSION: Thermosensitive liposomes of adriamycin combined with heating (42°C) can enhance the drug penetration across in vitro blood-brain barrier or blood-brain tumor barrier.

78149410344	The comparison of the clinical manifestations and risk factors of colorectal cancer and adenomas: Results from a colonoscopy-based study in southern Chinese	Background and aims: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal tumors in the world. This study aimed to compare the clinical manifestations and risk factors of CRC and adenomas in native patients of Guangzhou. Methods: Patients who underwent colonoscopy for the first time at Nanfang Hospital between July 2008 and July 2009 were recruited. Data on demographic information, main clinical manifestations, results of endoscopies and pathology, and possible risk factors of colorectal tumor were collected. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to compare the clinical characteristics and risk factors for CRC and adenomas. Results: Hematochezia and body weight loss were more frequent in proximal and distal CRC groups, respectively (P∈∈0.05). Older age [odds ratio (OR), 1.079; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.065-1.093], smoking status (OR, 1.712; 95% CI, 1.158-2.531), BMI∈=∈18.5-24.9 and∈∈25.0 (OR, 2.384; 95% CI, 1.250-4.549; OR, 2.162; 95% CI, 1.044-4.478, respectively) were significant risk factors for advanced adenoma, while female (OR, 0.638; 95% CI, 0.429-0.949) and using aspirin (OR, 0.188; 95% CI, 0.042-0.845) were significant protective factors. Hyperlipemia (OR, 0.109; 95% CI, 0.013-0.886) was identified as a protective factor for proximal CRC. Smoking (OR, 1.717; 95% CI, 1.093-2.696), drinking (OR, 1.817; 95% CI, 1.145-2.883), DM history (OR, 2.204; 95% CI, 1.044-4.652) were identified as independent risk factors for distal CRC, and using aspirin (OR, 0.190; 95% CI, 0.043-0.840) was a protective factor. Drinking (OR, 3.288; 95% CI, 1.546-6.994; OR, 1.862; 95% CI, 1.037-3.343, respectively) was an independent risk factor for both poorly to moderately differentiated CRC and well-differentiated CRC. Besides, DM (OR, 3.761; 95% CI, 1.615-8.762) and hypertension (OR, 0.384; 95% CI, 0.178-0.828) were identified as independent risk factor and protective factor for well-differentiated CRC, respectively. Conclusions: Hematochezia and body weight loss were representative manifestations for distal and proximal CRC, respectively. For southern Chinese the most important influential factors for colorectal tumor are age, smoking, drinking, nutritional state, DM, hypertension, and the use of aspirin. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

78149470999	Correlations between controlled endotracheal tube cuff pressure and postprocedural complications: A multicenter study	BACKGROUND: Postoperative respiratory complications related to endotracheal intubation usually present as cough, sore throat, hoarseness, and blood-streaked expectorant. In this study, we investigated the short-term (hours) impact of measuring and controlling endotracheal tube cuff (ETTc) pressure on postprocedural complications. METHODS: Five hundred nine patients from 4 tertiary care university hospitals in Shanghai, China scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia were assigned to a control group without measuring ETTc pressure, and a study group with ETTc pressure measured and adjusted. The duration of the procedure and duration of endotracheal intubation were recorded. Twenty patients whose duration of endotracheal intubation was between 120 and 180 minutes were selected from each group and examined by fiberoptic bronchoscopy immediately after removing the endotracheal tube. Endotracheal intubation-related complications including cough, sore throat, hoarseness, and blood-streaked expectorant were recorded at 24 hours postextubation. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in sex, age, height, weight, procedure duration, and duration of endotracheal intubation between the 2 groups. The mean ETTc pressure measured after estimation by palpation of the pilot balloon of the study group was 43 ± 23.3 mm Hg before adjustment (the highest was 210 mm Hg), and 20 ± 3.1 mm Hg after adjustment (P < 0.001). The incidence of postprocedural sore throat, hoarseness, and blood-streaked expectoration in the control group was significantly higher than in the study group. As the duration of endotracheal intubation increased, the incidence of sore throat and blood-streaked expectoration in the control group increased. The incidence of sore throat in the study group also increased with increasing duration of endotracheal intubation. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the 20 patients showed that the tracheal mucosa was injured in varying degrees in both groups, but the injury was more severe in the control group than in the study group. CONCLUSIONS: ETTc pressure estimated by palpation with personal experience is often much higher than measured or what may be optimal. Proper control of ETTc pressure by a manometer helped reduce ETT-related postprocedural respiratory complications such as cough, sore throat, hoarseness, and blood-streaked expectoration even in procedures of short duration (1-3 hours). © 2010 International Anesthesia Research Society.

78449248030	P21-activated kinase 5 inhibits camptothecin-induced apoptosis in colorectal carcinoma cells	p21-activated kinase 5 (PAK5) is a recently identified member of the group B PAK family. The PAK proteins are effectors of the small GTPase Cdc42 and Rac1 and are known to regulate cell motility and activate cell-survival signaling pathways. Especially, the mitochondrial localization of PAK5 is vital to its effects on apoptosis and cell survival. Previously, we demonstrated that PAK5 expression increased significantly during the malignant progression of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and that PAK5 promoted CRC metastasis by regulating CRC cell adhesion and migration. In the present study, we aim to investigate the role of PAK5 in camptothecin-induced apoptosis and its potential mechanism of action. Our results showed that overexpression of PAK5 inhibited camptothecin-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the activity of caspase-8 in CRC cells. Accordingly, knockdown of PAK5 in LoVo cells resulted in increased apoptosis. Mechanistically, we found that PAK5 directly phosphorylated Bad on serine 112 and indirectly led to phosphorylation of serine 136 via the Akt pathway. In conclusion, our study revealed previously unappreciated inhibitory role of PAK5 in camptothecin-induced apoptosis, thus suggesting PAK5 as a novel therapeutic target in CRC. © 2010 International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).

78649725013	Upregulation of scavenger receptor class B type I expression by activation of FXR in hepatocyte	Objective: The farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, has been proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases by regulating the metabolism and transport of cholesterol and triglyceride. Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a high-density lipoprotein receptor, plays an important role in decreasing lipid metabolism-associated cardiovascular diseases by regulating reverse cholesterol transport. Recent studies have shown that SR-BI expression is upregulated by several nuclear receptors. However, the role of FXR in the regulation of SR-BI expression is not well known. In the present study, we investigate the regulation of SR-BI by FXR in hepatocyte and the corresponding mechanism. Methods and results: Treatment of human hepatoma cell line HepG2 with FXR ligands resulted in upregulation of SR-BI at the levels of both mRNA and protein. Reporter assays showed that activation of FXR significantly enhanced the SR-BI promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that FXR induced SR-BI expression by binding to a novel FXR element (FXRE), a directed repeat DNA motif, DR8 (-703 AGGCCAcgttctagAGCTCA -684). The in vivo experiment demonstrated that gavaging mice with a natural ligand of FXR increased SR-BI expression in liver tissues. Conclusions: FXR can directly upregulate SR-BI expression in hepatocyte, and DR8 is a likely novel FXRE that is involved in SR-BI regulation. FXR may serve as a novel molecular target for manipulating SR-BI expression in hepatocyte. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

78649754561	Downregulation of B lymphocyte stimulator expression by curcumin in B lymphocyte via suppressing nuclear translocation of NF-κB	Overexpression of B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) is closely involved in the pathogenesis and progression of some autoimmune diseases. Curcumin, a pharmacologically safe agent, has been shown to possess potent anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is not clear whether curcumin affects the expression of BLyS. In this study, we report that curcumin inhibits the expression of BLyS and that a DNA-binding site for the transcriptional factor NF-κB in the BLyS promoter region is required for this regulation. Moreover, we find that curcumin reduces the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB to the BLyS promoter region and suppresses nuclear translocation of p65, suggesting that curcumin may suppress BLyS expression via negatively interfering with NF-κB signaling. These results suggest that curcumin may serve as a novel therapeutic agent in the treatment of autoimmune diseases by targeting BLyS. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

78650719843	Mda-7/IL-24 induces apoptosis in human GBC-SD gallbladder carcinoma cells via mitochondrial apoptotic pathway	mda-7/IL-24 has tumor-suppressor activity in a broad spectrum of human cancer cells. However, the therapeutic effect of the recombinant human IL-24 protein on human gallbladder carcinoma has rarely been explored. In this study, we used a human gallbladder carcinoma cell line (GBC-SD) to explore the effect of adenovirus-mediated IL-24 (Ad-IL24) gene therapy on GBC-SD cells. We show that Ad-IL24 treatment of GBC-SD cells in vitro conspicuously induced apoptosis of GBC-SD cells. We also demonstrate that the in vivo treatment of GBC tumor-bearing athymic nude mice intratumorally injected with Ad-IL24 significantly suppressed GBC growth. To further explore the mechanism that mda-7/IL-24 utilized in tumor cell apoptosis, we examined molecules and pathways involved in apoptotic regulation and found that Ad-IL24 induced the downregulation of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and the release of cytochrome c, which subsequently activated caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP to induce apoptosis. In summary, adenovirus (AdV)-mediated IL-24 overexpression exerted potent antitumor activity via stimulating mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in GBC-SD. Therefore, mda-7/IL-24 has the potential to serve as a tool for targeted gene therapy in the treatment of gallbladder cancer.

79952019075	Recurrence and surveillance of colorectal adenoma after polypectomy in a southern Chinese population	Background and aim: Repeat colonoscopy is often performed within a short time after polypectomy due to the fear that colorectal adenomas were missed during the initial colonoscopy or that new adenomas have developed. The aim of this study was to estimate the actual recurrence rate of adenoma and its association with the length of the surveillance interval after polypectomy in a southern Chinese population. Methods:A total of 1356 patients undergoing endoscopic polypectomy and completing three or more surveillence colonoscopies between 1976 and 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. The recurrence rates of adenoma and advanced adenoma and surveillance intervals after polypectomy were identified based on the features of adenomas detected on initial colonoscopy. Results:The recurrence rates of advanced adenoma in patients with non-advanced adenoma on the initial colonoscopy were 0.9, 3.9, 5.8, and 29.2% during surveillance intervals of 1-3, 3-5, 5-10, and 10-20 years post-initial colonoscopy; for patients with advanced adenoma on the initial colonoscopy, the recurrence rates were 3.8, 13.1, 34.7, and 52.0% during the same surveillance intervals, respectively. Older age (p < 0.05 for trend) and male sex [hazard ratio (HR) 2.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27-3.53] were significantly associated with recurrence for advanced adenoma, as were the size and number of baseline adenoma (p < 0.05 for trend), tubulovillous, villous adenoma (HR 2.57, 95% CI 1.24-5.32), and highgrade dysplasia (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.07-2.42). When 5% of patients had recurring advanced adenoma, the surveillance interval was estimated to be 6.9 (95% CI 6.3-12.2) years in the low-risk group and 3.0 (95% CI 2.7-3.2) years in the high-risk group. Conclusions Among our patient group, the recurrence of advanced adenoma after polypectomy increased with the length of the surveillance interval. Based on our results, a 3-year follow-up of patients after polypectomy could be effective in preventing the recurrence of advanced adenoma in high-risk patients. © Springer 2010.

0036058723	Differential display reveals a cDNA coding for an acyltransferase-like protein specific to taxol synthesis in Taxus chinensis	Using an mRNA differential display method, we successfully isolated an acyltransferase-like protein cDNA clone, TS4 (671 bp), specifically expressed in the taxol synthesis phase of Taxus chinensis cells. Database searches show TS4 has no similarities to published nucleotides. However, the coding sequence of TS4 exhibits significant homologies (33-34% identity, 49-52% similarity) to known acyltransferases from Taxus species and contains the conserved HXXXDG motif that is found in a family of acyltransferases. Several cDNAs corresponding to transcripts that accumulated or increased in the taxol synthesis phase also were cloned and sequenced. The results indicate the feasibility of using mRNA differential display for the isolation of genes involved in the secondary metabolism of higher plants.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which it enhances malignancy have not been fully elucidated. By using a mouse model that expresses IFN-γ locally in muscle, we found that the growth potential of tumours was increased after a quick decrease of IFN-γ. Furthermore, the up-regulation of IRF-2 (IFN regulatory factor 2) and down-regulation of IRF-1 were also found in the tumour cells. Along these lines, IFN-γ led to down-regulated expression of cyclin-D1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and up-regulated expression of p21

79959708922	Development and characteristics of temperature-sensitive liposomes for vinorelbine bitartrate	A novel liposome with temperature-sensitivity for vinorelbine bitartrate (VB) was designed to enhance VB targeted delivery and antitumor effect. Liposomes without drugs were prepared by thin film hydration, and then VB was entrapped into liposomes by pH gradient loading method. The mean particle size of the liposomes was about 100 nm, and the drug entrapment efficiency was more than 90%. Stability data indicated that the liposome was physically and chemically stable for at least 6 months at 4 °C. In vitro drug release study showed that drugs hardly released at 37 °C; while at 42 °C, drugs released quickly. For in vivo experiments, the lung tumor model was established by subcutaneous inoculation of cell suspension on mice, liposomes and free VB were injected i.v. in mice, followed by exposure the tumors to hyperthermia (HT) for 30 min after administration. The ratio of inhibition tumor of temperature-sensitive liposomes group was significantly higher than the normal injection group. Combining temperature-sensitive liposomes with HT enhanced the delivery of VB and, consequently, its antitumor effects. This liposome could potentially produce viable clinical strategies for improved targeting and delivery of VB for treatment of cancer. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79960320339	Improving efficiency of adriamycin crossing blood brain barrier by combination of thermosensitive liposomes and hyperthermia	Adriamycin (ADM)-encapsulated thermosensitive liposomes (ts-lip-ADM) and common liposomes (lip-ADM) were developed and evaluated. The encapsulation efficiency of the two liposomes were above 99%, and the average sizes of liposomes were about 120 nm. Temperature-dependent drug release from loaded liposomes in vitro was investigated: more than 90% of loaded ADM was released from ts-lip-ADM within 30 min at 42°C, while less than 3% was released from lip-ADM at 42°C beyond 120 min. An in vitro model of blood brain barrier (BBB) was established and evaluated by permeability and transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). The model was employed to study the permeability of liposomes in vitro. The permeability of ts-lip-ADM could be increased significantly after the temperature was raised to 42°C, which was about 10-16, 22-38, 38-45, 50-105 fold to that of ts-lip-ADM (37°C), lip-ADM (42°C), lip-ADM (37°C) and free ADM, respectively. C6 glioma-bearing mice model was developed and used to evaluate body distribution and anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. Mice were IV injected at a drug dose of 10 mg/kg. After administration the heads of mice were heated in water bath at 42°C for 30 min. The maximum brain concentration of ts-lip-ADM was 6.4, 3.7 fold compared with that of ADM solution and lip-ADM, respectively. The survival time of mice administered ts-lip-ADM (44 d) was remarkably longer than that of other three groups. This study indicates that ADM-encapsulated thermosensitive liposomes combined hyperthermia could enhance ADM delivery across BBB and prolong survival time of glioma-bearing mice. © 2011 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

80053471482	Lipopolysaccharide initiates a bypass feedback loop of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling by HPS70-induced COX-2 in H22 hepatocarcinoma cells	LPS can induce TACE upregulation via signaling from TLR4-derived EGFR activation in tumor cells. The regulation and activity of TACE have been investigated with the observation that gene expression is upregulated in response to LPS followed by EGFR activation, however, the process remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the effects of LPS on H22 hepatocarcinoma cells that displayed constitutively active TLR4 expression. Upon TLR4 shRNA transfection into H22 cells, HSP70 expression significantly increased. However, LPS induced early phosphorylation of EGFR in H22 cells, which reached maximum levels within 30 min. Inhibition of TLR4 in H22 cells resulted in a significant rise in both EGFR phosphorylation and TACE upregulation 24 h after exposure to LPS. Exogenous HSP70 also induced rapid phosphorylation of EGFR, upregulated the expression of COX-2 via a signaling pathway that involved TACE-dependent TGF-α release. Furthermore, inhibition of EGFR activation and reduction of COX-2 expression by COX-2 inhibitor prevented HSP70-induced cell invasion in vitro. These findings demonstrate that the biological importance of HSP70/COX-2 is crucial to the second, but not the first, phase of EGFR phosphorylation in tumor cells. The growth of tumor cells by inserting shRNA plasmid TLR4 combination with COX-2 inhibitor could be effectively reduced in LPS stimulation. We concluded that LPS triggered a bypass feedback loop of EGFR activation and involved HSP70/COX-2 in H22 cells by inhibition of TLR4 and that EGFR phosphorylation is implicated in tumor growth by LPS stimulation.

83255181885	Chaetoglobosin Fex from the marine-derived endophytic fungus inhibits induction of inflammatory mediators via toll-like receptor 4 signaling in macrophages	Chaetoglobosin Fex (Cha Fex), a cytochalasan-based alkaloid, was isolated from marine-derived endophytic fungus Chaetomium globosum QEN-14. The knowledge of its biological function is still limited. We investigated the effects and mechanism of Cha Fex on inflammatory mediators via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in macrophages. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TLR4 ligand, was therefore designed to active TLR4 signaling pathway, and Cha Fex significantly inhibited the LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in peritoneal macrophages and murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) detection also found that Cha Fex down-regulated the mRNA expressions of these pro-inflammtory cytokines. Moreover, Cha Fex significantly attenuated the LPS-stimulated degradation of inhibitory kappa B-alpha and the subsequent translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) to the nucleus. Cha Fex also reduced the phosphorylations of extracellular-signal-related kinase (ERK1/2), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1/2). Furthermore, we confirmed that Cha Fex didn't affect LPS binding to the RAW264.7 cells and human monocytes, while Cha Fex was able to inhibit the increase of membrane-associated CD14 (mCD14) expression both on RAW cells and human monocytes induced by LPS to a certain degree. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory property of Cha Fex may be attributed to NF-κB inhibition as well as the negative regulation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2 phosphorylations. On the other hand, these inhibitory effects may also be due to the blocking of mCD14 expression. © 2011 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

84857667301	The role of Hedgehog signaling pathway in liver regeneration	Background/Aims: In this study, we explored the role of the Hedgehog signaling pathway in liver regeneration. Methodology: Retrorsine, partial hepatectomy and combined were utilized in mature Fisher344 rats. Specific assays, such as RT-PCR, real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the constituents of the Hedgehog signaling pathway during liver regeneration. Results: mRNA expression of Ihh, Ptc, Smo, Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3 were all shown in liver tissue homogenates in control/normal, retrorsine, partial hepatectomy and retrorsine/partial hepatectomy groups while no Shh expression was found. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that there were significant differenc-es in Hedgehog signaling pathway-related constituents (Ihh, Ptc, Gli1 and Gli3) among the different treatment groups and at distinct time points in the same treatment group during liver regeneration. The data also suggested an interaction effect between different treatment and time to the variation of Ihh, Ptc, Gli1 and Gli3. The protein expression of Ptc and Gli1 in liver regeneration was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, which differed in the duration among different groups. Nevertheless, the protein expression of Ptc and Gli1 were not detected successfully by western blot. Conclusions: It appears that the Hedgehog signaling pathway may be involved in liver regeneration. © H.G.E. Update Medical Publishing S.A.

84856740553	Risk of ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer in China: A multi-center retrospective study	Background: The number of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in China has increased in the past 10 years. Thus, it is anticipated that the incidence of UC-associated colorectal cancer (UC-CRC) will also increase. However, the risk of CRC in UC patients is still unknown in Chinese. The aim of this study was to identify the risk and risk factors of UC-CRC in Chinese. Methods: A total of 3,922 patients with UC were retrospectively collected from five central teaching hospitals in China, in which high-quality endoscopic and histological diagnoses were available from 1998 to 2009. The database of the UC and UC-associated CRC patients was evaluated. Results: CRC was diagnosed 34 in patients, and the overall prevalence of CRC in patients with UC was 0.87%. The cumulative risk of developing CRC after a disease duration of 10 years was 1.15% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-1.84%); 20 years, 3.56% (95% CI 2.14-5.89%); and 30 years, 14.36% (95% CI 7.57-26.3%). Longer disease duration, extensive colitis, and dysplasia found in the biopsy specimen were identified as risk factors for developing CRC. 5-ASA use was identified as a protective factor of UC-CRC. Conclusions: The period prevalence of CRC was lower than that reported from the West. However, the cumulative risk was found to be comparable to that of Western countries, which suggests that the period prevalence of UC-CRC in China may be growing in the future. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84855784138	PAK1-dependent MAPK pathway activation is required for colorectal cancer cell proliferation	P21-activated protein kinase1 (PAK1), a main downstream effector of small Rho GTPases, Rac1, and Cdc42, plays an important role in the regulation of cell morphogenesis, motility, mitosis, and angiogenesis. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms of PAK1 that contributed to colorectal carcinogenesis remain unclear. Our immunohistochemistry showed that PAK1 expression was increased with colorectal cancer (CRC) progression through the adenoma to carcinoma sequence. Furthermore, our results suggested a relationship between PAK1 nuclear localization and the Dukes staging. In the present study, we showed that PAK1 knockdown decreased proliferation and delayed the G1/S cell-cycle transition, and increased apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. In addition, PAK1 knock-down downregulated c-Jun amino terminal kinases (JNK) activity and the levels of cyclinD1, CDK4/6. Inhibition of the JNK activity by chemical inhibitor (SP600125) significantly reduced the effects of PAK1 on CRC proliferation via accumulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN). In conclusion, our results demonstrate that knockdown of PAK1 could enhance the chemosensitivity of CRCs to 5-fluorouracil through G1 arrest. The mechanism by which PAK1 induced cancer growth might involve activation of JNK as well as downregulation of PTEN. Targeting PAK1 may represent a novel treatment strategy for developing novel chemotherapeutic agents. © 2012 International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).

84859831468	Feasibility of orthotopic fetal liver transplantation: An experimental study	BACKGROUND: The use of livers from nonviable fetuses is particularly attractive for its potential to solve the current limitations of organ availability for the pediatric recipient. Therefore, it is essential to study the feasibility of orthotopic fetal liver transplantation. METHOD: We measured the hepatic and extra-hepatic anatomical structures of fetal and neonatal lambs and established an orthotopic liver transplantation model of the fetal lamb. RESULTS: Mean weight of the liver of fetal lambs at 142 to 145 days gestation was 34.75 g and the mean diameter of the portal vein was 3.03 mm, the supra-hepatic vena cava was 5.88 mm, and the infra-hepatic vena cava was 4.00 mm, which matched the corresponding sizes in neonatal lambs aged up to 2 weeks. Using standard surgical procedures we completed the vascular inosculation of fetal liver. However, all the newborn lamb recipients survived less than 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Orthotopic transplantation of the fetal liver is anatomically and technically feasible. However, perioperative issues need to be resolved prior to clinical application. © 2012, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

84859874520	Downregulation of human farnesoid X receptor by miR-421 promotes proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells	The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that is highly expressed in liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and intestine. It plays an important role in regulating the progression of several cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). So it is necessary to study the regulation of FXR. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-421 was inversely correlated with FXR protein level in HCC cell lines. Treatment with miR-421 mimic repressed FXR translation. The reporter assay revealed that miR-421 targeted 3′ untranslated region of human FXR mRNA. Furthermore, downregulation of FXR by miR-421 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. These results suggest that miR-421 may serve as a novelmolecular target for manipulating FXR expression in hepatocyte and for the treatment of HCC. ©2012 AACR.

In the present study, TFPI-2 expression in GBC tissues was examined, and its inhibitory activities against GBC growth were evaluated in vitro and in vivo after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of TFPI-2 (Ad5-TFPI-2) was constructed to restore the expression of TFPI-2 in GBC cell lines (GBC-SD, SGC-996, NOZ) and xenograft tumors. Immunohistochemical staining showed that TFPI-2 was significantly downregulated in GBC tissue specimens. Ad5-TFPI-2 could significantly inhibit GBC growth both in vitro and in vivo. Apoptosis analysis and western blotting assay demonstrated that Ad5-TFPI-2 could induce the apoptosis of both GBC cell lines and tissues by promoting the activities of cytochrome c, Bax, caspase-3 and -9 and suppressing Bcl-2 activity. These data indicated that TFPI-2 acts as a tumor suppressor in GBC, and may have a potential role in gene therapy for GBC. © 2012 Japanese Cancer Association.

84862657956	Let-7b inhibits human cancer phenotype by targeting cytochrome P450 epoxygenase 2J2	Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNA molecules of 20 to 22 nucleotides that regulate gene expression by binding to their 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR). Increasing data implicate altered miRNA participation in the progress of cancer. We previously reported that CYP2J2 epoxygenase promotes human cancer phenotypes. But whether and how CYP2J2 is regulated by miRNA is not understood. Methods and Results: Using bioinformatics analysis, we found potential target sites for miRNA let-7b in 3′UTR of human CYP2J2. Luciferase and western blot assays revealed that CYP2J2 was regulated by let-7b. In addition, let-7b decreased the enzymatic activity of endogenous CYP2J2. Furthermore, let-7b may diminish cell proliferation and promote cell apoptosis of tumor cells via posttranscriptional repression of CYP2J2. Tumor xenografts were induced in nude mice by subcutaneous injection of MDA-MB-435 cells. The let-7b expression vector, pSilencer-let-7b, was injected through tail vein every 3 weeks. Let-7b significantly inhibited the tumor phenotype by targeting CYP2J2. Moreover, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to determine the expression levels of let-7b and CYP2J2 protein from 18 matched lung squamous cell cancer and adjacent normal lung tissues; the expression level of CYP2J2 was inversely proportional to that of let-7b. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the decreased expression of let-7b could lead to the high expression of CYP2J2 protein in cancerous tissues. These findings suggest that miRNA let-7b reduces CYP2J2 expression, which may contribute to inhibiting tumor phenotypes. © 2012 Chen et al.

84862777718	Preliminary experience of endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection for upper gastrointestinal submucosal tumors	Background and study aim: Although the majority of submucosal tumors (SMTs) are benign, some do have a malignant potential. Resection of SMTs would aid in establishing the diagnosis and may be curative. Our aim was to examine the feasibility and safety of a novel method for endoscopic resection of upper gastrointestinal SMTs. Patients and methods: In 12 patients who presented with an upper gastrointestinal SMT of 40mm located in the esophagus or cardia, a submucosal tunnel was endoscopically created starting approximately 5cm proximal to the lesion. After careful submucosal dissection with carbon dioxide or air insufflation, the SMTs were completely removed, and the entrance of the tunnel closed using endoclips. Results: SMTs had a mean size of 19.5mm (range 10-40mm); eight were located in the esophagus and four in the cardia. SMT resection was successful in all patients with en bloc resection in 10 patients (83.3%) and resection in two pieces in the remaining two patients. The mean time required for the procedure was 48.3 minutes (range 30-60 minutes). Two patients had both pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema. All the complications resolved with conservative management. Conclusions: In this pilot study, endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection (ESTD) of esophageal and cardia SMTs was effective and appeared to be safe. Larger studies that also examine its application for gastric SMTs are warranted. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

84863124865	ER stress negatively modulates the expression of the miR-199a/214 cluster to regulates tumor survival and progression in human hepatocellular cancer	Background: Recent studies have emphasized causative links between microRNAs (miRNAs) deregulation and tumor development. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), more and more miRNAs were identified as diagnostic and prognostic cancer biomarkers, as well as additional therapeutic tools. This study aimed to investigate the functional significance and regulatory mechanism of the miR-199a2/214 cluster in HCC progression. Methods and Findings: In this study, we showed that miR-214, as well as miR-199a-3p and miR-199a-5p levels were significantly reduced in the majority of examined 23 HCC tissues and HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cell lines, compared with their nontumor counterparts. To further explore the role of miR-214 in hepatocarcinogenesis, we disclosed that the ER stress-induced pro-survival factor XBP-1 is a target of miR-214 by using western blot assay and luciferase reporter assay. Re-expression of miR-214 in HCC cell lines (HepG2 and SMMC-7721) inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-214 dramatically suppressed the ability of HCC cells to form colonies in vitro and to develop tumors in a subcutaneous xenotransplantation model of the BALB/c athymic nude mice. Moreover, reintroduction of XBP-1s attenuated miR-214-mediated suppression of HCC cells proliferation, colony and tumor formation. To further understand the mechanism of the miR-199a/214 cluster down-expression in HCC, we found that thapsigargin (TG) and tunicamycin (TM) or hypoxia-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) suppresses the expression of the miR-199a/214 cluster in HCC cells. By promoter analysis of the miR-199a2/214 gene, we conjectured NFκB as a potential negative regulator. We further found that UPR and LPS-induced NFκB activation suppressed miR-199a2/214 transcription, and this suppression was reversed by NFκB inhibition in HCC cells. Conclusions: Our study suggest that modulation of miR-214 levels may provide a new therapeutic approach for cancer treatment and revealed that UPR may offer a new explanation for why the miR-199a/214 cluster were down-regulated in the progression in HCC. © 2012 Duan et al.

The aim of this study was to clarify that circulating miR-1 and miR-126 in human plasma might be useful as biomarkers in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In our study, after pre-test, two candidate miRNAs were detected by using real-time RT-PCR. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations were measured by ELISA assay in plasma from patients with AMI (n=17) and healthy subjects (n=25), simultaneously. Increased miR-1 and decreased miR-126 in plasma from patients with AMI after the onset of symptoms compared with healthy subjects were found. A remarkable finding in this study is that miR-1, miR-126 and cTnI expression levels exhibited the same trend. Our results suggest that the plasma concentrations of miR-1 and miR-126 may be useful indicators for AMI. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

84864813741	Risk and cause of interval colorectal cancer after colonoscopic polypectomy	Background: To investigate the cause and risk of interval colorectal cancer (ICC) in patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy within 5 years after colonoscopic polypectomy. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data (endoscopy, pathology, demography) of patients who received surveillance colonoscopy within 5 years after colonoscopic polypectomy. Results: Among 1,794 patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy within 5 years after colonoscopic polypectomy, 14 suffered from ICC. The mean follow-up time was 2.67 years and the incidence density of ICC was 2.9 cases per 1,000 person-years. 50% of ICCs were found in patients in whom adenomas had been incompletely removed by endoscopic therapy, 36% were missed cancers, and 14% were new cancers. Age >60 years (OR 2.97, 95% CI 2.31-3.82) was significantly associated with interval cancer on the surveillance colonoscopy as were advanced adenoma (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.01-1.62), the presence of villous (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.03-1.85) and high-grade dysplasia (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.07-2.42). Conclusions: Among patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy within 5 years after polypectomy, the incidence density of ICC was 2.9 cases per 1,000 person-years. The majority of interval cancers originated from incomplete resection of advanced adenomas and missed cancers, which can be prevented by improving endoscopic techniques and selecting an appropriate follow-up time interval. © 2012 S.

84867610795	Activation of liver X receptor attenuates endothelin-1 expression in vascular endothelial cells	Endothelin-1 (ET-1), predominantly produced by vascular endothelial cells (VECs), plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Liver X receptor (LXR), a typical nuclear receptor, is known for inhibiting expression of inflammatory molecules. However, it remains unclear whether LXR suppresses ET-1 expression. In the present study, we showed that pretreatment with GW3965, a specific ligand of LXR, significantly attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ET-1 in mice plasma. The in vitro experiments showed that both LXRα and β were expressed in human VECs, and they are functional as demonstrated by induction of the target gene ABCA1 after treatment with GW3965. Moreover, activation of LXR with GW3965 in human VECs dramatically attenuated the basal and LPS-stimulated ET-1 production at both transcriptional and translational levels. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that LXR activation suppressed the transcriptional activity of the human ET-1 gene promoter, and repressed the activity of a heterologous promoter driven by the response elements of activator-1 (AP-1) or nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that activation of LXR reduced the binding of the transcriptional factors AP-1 and NF-κB to the ET-1 gene promoter region. In conclusion, activation of LXR represses ET-1 expression in vivo and in vitro, which may be involved in the negatively interfering with AP-1/NF-κB signaling. These results suggest that LXRs may serve as a novel molecular target for modulating ET-1 expression in VECs, and even for the treatment of ET-1-associated inflammatory diseases. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84869007757	Activation of farnesoid X receptor increases the expression of cytokine inducible SH2-Containing protein in HepG2 cells	Cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein (CISH), which negatively regulates cytokine signaling by inhibiting JAK2/STAT5 activity, is regarded as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, has been proposed to play a protective function in the inflammatory responses. However, the role of FXR in modulation of CISH expression is unknown. In the present study, we for the first time identified that in human hepatoma cell line HepG2 the activation of FXR by the natural agonist chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and the synthetic specific agonist GW4064 upregulated CISH at both transcriptional and translational levels, and inhibited interleukin (IL)6-induced STAT5 activation. Moreover, the in vivo experiment demonstrated that gavaging mice with CDCA increased CISH expression and reduced basal STAT5 phosphorylation in liver tissues. Reporter assay showed that FXR agonists enhanced the transcriptional activity of CISH promoter. These data suggest that FXR may serve as a novel molecular target for manipulating CISH expression in hepatocytes. FXR-mediated upregulation of CISH may play an important role in the homeostasis of cytokine signal networks and be beneficial to control cytokine-associated inflammatory diseases. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.

84869827316	Preliminary study on molluscicidal effect of Euphorbia helioscopia L ethanol extracts against Oncomelania hupensis	Objective: To study the influences of Euphorbia helioscopia L. on glycogen contents of Oncomelania hupensis so as to explore its molluscicidal mechanism. Methods: The different polar factions of Euphorbia helioscopia L. were separated by using the systemic solvent segregation method, and then its molluscicidal activity was detected according to the Laboratory Final Milluscicides Screening Method issued by WHO. The glycogen contents of soft tissues of Oncomelania hupensis snails treated by Euphorbia helioscopia L. ethanol extracts were determined by the anthrone method. Results: After being immersed for 48 h with Euphorbia helioscopia L. ethanol extracts, the death rates of the snails at the concentrations of 400 mg/L and 800 mg/L were 50.43% and 77.50% respectively, while after 96 h, the death rates at the above concentrations were both 100%. The glycogen contents of the snails gradually reduced with the increase of the drug concentrations, the glycogen content decreased to the lowest while the concentration was 800 mg/L, and the glycogen content decreased by 69.49% compared with that of the control group. Conclusion: The Euphorbia helioscopia L. ethanol extracts can significantly decrease the glycogen content of Oncomelania snails and the extracts have an adequate molluscicidal activity.

84869832205	Schistosomicidal effect of BTW5 on adult and juvenile Schistosoma japonicum in vitro	Objective: To evaluate the killing effect of BTW5 on both juvenile and adult, worms of Schistosoma japonicum in vitro. Methods: The mice were infected with cercariae of Schistosoma japonicum obtained from infected Oncomelania hupensis. The juvenile worms were obtained from the liver and mesenteric veins of the mice by perfusion 18 d after the infection, and the adult worms were obtained from the liver and mesenteric veins of the mice by perfusion 5 weeks after the infection. The adult and juvenile worms were cultivated in DMEM medium containing different concentrations of BTW5 and were observed for 3 d. After the observation, the worms were stained by hydrochloric acid carmine to observe the injuries. Results: The death rates and motility reducing rates of adult and juvenile worms in DMEM medium containing different concentrations of BTW5 were significantly higher than those in the controls. The staining suggested that BTW5 had a damage effect on the tegument and the intestinal canal of the male and female worms, in addition to the ovaries of the female worms. Conclusion: BTW5 has an antischistosomal effect on adult and juvenile worms of Oncomelania hupensis.

Methods: A total of 67 patients with suspected small bowel diseases who underwent SBE via the oral and/or anal routes from January 2009 to August 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Data were extracted from electronic clinical and endoscopy records. The indications, SBE procedure time, diagnostic yield and complications were summarized and evaluated. Results: A total of 42 SBE procedures through the oral route and 38 via the anal route were performed in these 67 patients. Patients were referred mainly for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) (40.3%) and abdominal pain (29.8%). The mean procedure duration was 68.1min from the oral cavity and 77.5min from the anus. The estimated depth of insertion was 247.6±80.3cm from the oral cavity and 131.1±68.7cm from the anus. The overall significant diagnostic yield was 68.7%. In patients with OGIB and unexplained chronic abdominal pain, the diagnostic yield was 74.1% and 50.0%, respectively. There were no significant complications. Conclusion: SBE appears to be a safe and effective method for the diagnosis and treatment of deep small bowel disease. © 2012 The Authors.

84868566915	Pre-treatment with IL-1β enhances the efficacy of MSC transplantation in DSS-induced colitis	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used experimentally for treating inflammatory disorders, partly due to their immunosuppressive properties. Although interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is one of the most important inflammatory mediators, growing evidence indicates that IL-1β signaling elicits the immunosuppressive properties of MSCs. However, it remains unclear how IL-1β signaling accomplishes this activity. Here, we focus on the therapeutic efficacy of IL-1β-primed MSCs in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model, in addition to the underlining mechanisms. We first found that IL-1β-primed MSCs, without any observable phenotype change in vitro, significantly attenuated the development of DSS-induced murine colitis. Moreover, IL-1β-primed MSCs modulated the balance of immune cells in the spleen and the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) through elevating cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), IL-6 and IL-8 expression and influencing the polarization of peritoneal macrophages. Importantly, IL-1β-primed MSCs possessed an enhanced ability to migrate to the inflammatory site of the gut via upregulation of chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) expression. In summary, IL-1β-primed MSCs have improved efficacy in treating DSS-induced colitis, which at least partly depends on their increased immunosuppressive capacities and enhanced migration ability. © 2012 CSI and USTC.

84870900923	Circulating miR-30a, miR-195 and let-7b Associated with Acute Myocardial Infarction	Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in diverse biological and pathological processes, including the regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and cellular differentiation. Recently, circulating miRNAs have been reported as potential biomarkers for various pathologic conditions. This study investigated miR-30a, miR-195 and let-7b as potential of biomarker for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods and Results: Plasma samples from 18 patients with AMI and 30 healthy adults were collected. Total RNA was extracted from plasma with TRIzol LS Reagent. MiRNA levels and plasma cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA assay, respectively. Results showed that circulating miR-30a in AMI patients was highly expressed at 4 h, 8 h and 12 h after onset of AMI, and miR-195 was highly expressed at 8 h and 12 h. However, let-7b was lower in AMI patients than in controls throughout the whole time points. Interestingly, in these patients, circulating miR-30a, miR-195 and let-7b all reached their expression peak at 8 h. By the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, these plasma miRNAs were of significant diagnostic value for AMI. The combined ROC analysis revealed the an AUC value of 0.93 with 94% sensitivity and 90% specificity at 8 h after onset, and an AUC value of 0.92 with 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity at 12 h after onset, in discriminating the AMI patients from healthy controls. Conclusions: Our results imply that the plasma concentration of miR-30a, miR-195 and let-7b can be potential indicators for AMI. © 2012 Long et al.

84871461165	Somatostatin enhanced anti-tumor effect of doxorubicin on gallbladder caner cells through the regulation of intracellular drug concentration	Objective: To investigate the possible mechanisms by which Somatostatin (SST) enhances the anti-tumor effect of doxorubicin (DOX) on gallbladder cancer cells. Methods: GBC-SD cells were grouped into 4 groups: SST-treated group, DOX-treated group, SST + DOX co-treated group and control group. The concentrations of SST and DOX were 75 μg/ml and 5 μg/ml based on our previous studies. In control group, cells were cultivated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In experimental groups, cells were cultivated with medium and the corresponding drugs. After drug treatment, cell viability was examined by MTT assay at 6, 12, 24 and 36 h respectively. Meanwhile, intracellular concentrations of doxorubicin in each group was determined by microspectrofluorimetry; Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine the expressions of MDR1 mRNA in the cells at different time points and the expressions of P-gp protein, a product of MDR1 mRNA, were determined by Western blot analysis. Results: SST did not exhibit significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation of GBC-SD cells as compared to that of control group (P > 0.05). SST + DOX co-treatment group and DOX showed significantly inhibitory effect on the growth of GBC-SD cells at Hour 12 post-treatment. However no statistical difference was found between SST + DOX and DOX groups. Interestingly, at Hour 24 post-treatment, SST + DOX group showed more robust inhibitory effect on GBC-SD cells as compared to DOX alone group. Moreover, SST could significantly down-regulate the expressions of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp protein. SST could increase intracellular DOX concentration. And the difference of intracellular DOX concentration between SST + DOX group and DOX group at Hour 24 was statistically significant. Conclusions: In our experiment, SST decreases the expression of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp protein so as to reduce the efflux of DOX and elevate DOX concentrations in GBC-SD cells. This eventually leads to enhanced cytotoxic effects of DOX on GBC-SD cells.

84875177727	Infections of Helicobacter spp. in the biliary system are associated with biliary tract cancer: A meta-analysis	OBJECTIVE: As Helicobacter spp. have been successfully isolated from the biliary system, a hypothetical question was raised about the role of these organisms in the development of biliary tract cancer. This meta-analysis has been carried out to explore the association between Helicobacter spp. infection and biliary tract cancer. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out to identify all eligible articles. Meta-analysis used odds ratio and a random-effect model, and 95% confidence intervals for odds ratios were calculated. Heterogeneity was quantitatively assessed using the χ-test, with significance set at a P-value of 0.01, and was measured using the I-statistic. RESULTS: Ten studies published between 2002 and 2011 were finally included for meta-analysis. Helicobacter pylori, Helicobacter bilis, Helicobacter hepaticus, and Helicobacter ganmani were studied. With heterogeneity (I=0%, P=0.685), a significantly higher pooled infection rate of Helicobacter spp. was observed in the biliary tract cancer group compared with the normal group (P=0.0001) and the benign biliary disease group, respectively (P=0.0001). Studies from East Asia and South Asia showed a higher prevalence of Helicobacter spp. in the malignant group. Evidence supporting the higher presence of Helicobacter spp. in the cancer group was obtained using PCR and immunohistochemical analysis of specimens from bile and biliary tissues. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests a trend of a higher presence of Helicobacter spp. in patients with biliary tract cancers compared with normal controls or those with benign biliary diseases.

84874833610	Impacts of climate change on potential climatic productivity of wheat in Suzhou	Global climate change has far-reaching impact on natural ecosystems and the socio -economic system, which has called for attention of governments and scientific community and even the general public now. In the background of global climate change, the study of the effect of climate change on crop potential production has an important theoretical and practical significance. The relationship between wheat productivity and climate change and the response of the wheat productivity to the climate change were studied with Suzhou, China being a study area, aiming to provide a scientific basis for rational development and utilization of climate resources against the global climate change in Suzhou. The results showed that the annual average temperature of Suzhou tended to increase by 0.23°C per 10 years from 1977 to 2007. The annual precipitation has not been increased obviously over the recent 30 years. In the terms of annual change of climatic productivity of wheat, the average wheat productivity on the whole showed a increasing trend the last 50 years. However, the potential climatic productivity of wheat every decade first decrease and then increased. The correlation analysis indicated that there were assume the weak and assumes the strong correlations between the wheat climate productivity and the temperature and the precipitation with their relation coefficients (R) are R=0.04187 and R=0.70051, respectively. the influence of the precipitation to the Suzhou wheat climate productivity is higher than the temperature obviously. But there were the strong correlations between the wheat actual output and the temperature and the precipitation, therefore, the temperature and the precipitation are the important attributes that enhances wheat climate productivity realization rate. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84875319095	Bis-N-norgliovictin, a small-molecule compound from marine fungus, inhibits LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages and improves survival in sepsis	Sepsis is a highly lethal disorder characterized by systemic inflammation, and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in macrophages plays a crucial role in modulating innate immune response and outcome of sepsis. During the screening of natural products against inflammation, we identified bis-N-norgliovictin, a small-molecule compound isolated from marine-derived fungus, significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS, ligand of TLR4)-induced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production in RAW264.7 cells. In this study, we evaluated the effect of bis-N-norgliovictin on TLR4-mediated inflammation in mouse macrophages and LPS-induced sepsis model. In RAW264.7 and mouse peritoneal macrophages, bis-N-norgliovictin dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced production of TNF-α, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-β (IFN-β) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), but without suppressing cell viability. The anti-inflammatory effect was attributed to the down-regulation of TLR4-triggered myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88)-dependent and TIR-containing adapter inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-dependent signaling pathways, including p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) cascades. Importantly, bis-N-norgliovictin also protected mice against LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Intravenous injection of bis-N-norgliovictin 1 h before LPS challenge dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced increases in serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-10, attenuated liver and lung injury and diminished M1 macrophage polarization in liver. Our results demonstrate that bis-N-norgliovictin exhibit potent anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that bis-N-norgliovictin can be a useful therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sepsis and other inflammatory diseases. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84875761392	Bioactive polyoxygenated steroids from the South China Sea soft coral, Sarcophyton sp.	Seven new polyoxygenated steroids (1-7) were isolated together with seven known analogues (8-14) from the South China Sea soft coral, Sarcophyton sp. The structures of the new compounds were identified on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis and comparison with reported data. All the steroids are characterized with 3β,5α,6β-hydroxy moiety, displaying carbon skeletons of cholestane, ergostane, gorgostane and 23,24-dimethyl cholestane. In the in vitro bioassay, metabolites exhibited different levels of antimicrobial activity against bacterial species Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium, and fungal species Microbotryum violaceum and Septoria tritici. No inhibition was detected towards microalga Chlorella fusca. Preliminary structure-activity analysis suggests that the 11α-acetoxy group may increase both antibacterial and antifungal activities. The terminal-double bond and the cyclopropane moiety at the side chain may also contribute to the bioactivity. © 2013 by the authors.

84875391503	Effects of small interfering RNA inhibit class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase on human gastric cancer cells	AIM: To investigate the effects of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition of Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Class I PI3K) signal transduction on the proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy of gastric cancer SGC7901 and MGC803 cells. METHODS: We constructed the recombinant replication adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNA interference (RNAi)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and control adenovirus NC-RNAi-GFP, and infected it into human gastric cancer cells. MTT assay was used to determine the growth rate of the gastric cancer cells. Activation of autophagy was monitored with monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining after adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP and control adenovirus NC-RNAi-GFP treatment. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression of micro-tubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using the fluorescent probe JC-1. The expression of autophagy was monitored with MDC, LC3 staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Western blotting was used to detect p53, Beclin-1, Bcl-2, and LC3 protein expression in the culture supernatant. RESULTS: The viability of gastric cancer cells was inhibited after siRNA targeting to the Class I PI3K blocked Class I PI3K signal pathway. MTT assays revealed that, after SGC7901 cancer cells were treated with adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP, the rate of inhibition reached 27.48% ± 2.71% at 24 h, 41.92% ± 2.02% at 48 h, and 50.85% ± 0.91% at 72 h. After MGC803 cancer cells were treated with adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP, the rate of inhibition reached 24.39% ± 0.93% at 24 h, 47.00% ± 0.87% at 48 h, and 70.30% ± 0.86% at 72 h (P < 0.05 compared to control group). It was determined that when 50 MOI, the transfec-tion effciency was 95% ± 2.4%. Adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP (50 MOI) induced mitochondrial dysfunction and activated cell apoptosis in SGC7901 cells, and the results described here prove that RNAi of Class I PI3K induced apoptosis in SGC7901 cells. The results showed that adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP transfection induced punctate distribution of LC3 immunoreactivity, indicating increased formation of autophagosomes. The results showed that the basal level of Beclin-1 and LC3 protein in SGC7901 cells was low. After incubating with adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP (50 MOI), Beclin-1, LC3, and p53 protein expression was significantly increased from 24 to 72 h. We also found that Bcl-2 protein expression down-regulated with the treatment of adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP (50 MOI). A number of isolated membranes, possibly derived from ribosome-free endoplasmic reticulum, were seen. These isolated membranes were elongated and curved to engulf a cytoplasmic fraction and organelles. We used transmission electron microscopy to identify ultrastructural changes in SGC7901 cells after adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP (50 MOI) treatment. Control cells showed a round shape and contained normal-looking organelles, nucleus, and chromatin, while adenovirus PI3K(I)-RNAi-GFP (50 MOI)-treated cells exhibited the typical signs of autophagy. CONCLUSION: After the Class I PI3K signaling pathway has been blocked by siRNA, the proliferation of cells was inhibited and the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells was enhanced. © 2013 Baishideng.

84875039955	Epigallocatechin gallate inhibits the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells by regulating Notch signaling	Aims:To explore the inhibitory effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells and on the gene expression of Notch signaling. Methods: The colorectal cancer cells and orthotopic colorectal cancer transplant model were treated with EGCG, and MTT assay was used to test the inhibitory role of EGCG in the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. Results: MTT assay indicated that EGCG inhibited the proliferation of these four cell lines when the time and concentration increased, and EGCG enhanced the apoptotic rate of these four cell lines. The dosage was positively correlated to the apoptotic rate, and EGCG inhibited the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells by influencing cell cycle. In-vivo study suggested that on the seventh day, the volume of tumors reduced after administrating with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg of EGCG. At the twenty-eighth day, the volume of tumors was significantly different in three EGCG treatment groups as compared to the control group (P < 0.05), and TUNEL assay indicated that the apoptosis of cancer cells in EGCG treated groups was markedly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). In these cell lines, the expressions of HES1 and Notch2 in EGCG treated groups were remarkably lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The expression of JAG1 decreased in SW480 cells (P = 0.019), HT-29 cells and HCT-8 cells, but increased in LoVo cells at mRNA level. The expression of Notch1 was upregulated in these four cell lines, but its expression was significantly upregulated only in LoVo and SW480 cells (P < 0.05). Conclusion: In-vitro and in-vivo studies showed that EGCG inhibited the proliferation, induced the apoptosis and affected the cell cycle of colorectal cancer cells. After treating with EGCG, the expressions of HES1 and Notch2 was obviously inhibited, this indicated that EGCG inhibited colorectal cancer by inhibiting HES1 and Notch2. © 2013 Jin et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84879886056	Curcumin protects against collagen-induced arthritis via suppression of BAFF production	Purpose: The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the anti-Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) effect of curcumin is associated with the regulation of B cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) production. Methods: Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced in DBA/1 J mice by immunization with bovine type II collagen. To investigate the anti-arthritic effect of curcumin in the CIA model, mice were injected intraperitoneally with curcumin (50 mg/kg) on every other day either from day 1 or from day 28 after the first immunization. The clinical severity of arthritis was monitored. BAFF, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-γ (IFNγ) production in serum were measured. Furthermore, the effect of curcumin on IFNγ-induced BAFF expression and transcriptional activation in B lymphocytes was determined by qPCR, Western Blot, and luciferase assay. Finally, IFNγ related signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling in B lymphocytes were studied using Western Blot. Results: Curcumin dramatically attenuated the progression and severity of CIA in DBA/1 J mice, accompanied with decrease of BAFF production in serum and spleen cells as well as decrease of serum IFNγ and IL-6. Treatment of B lymphocytes with curcumin suppressed IFNγ-induced BAFF expression, STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, suggesting that curcumin may repress IFNγ-induced BAFF expression via negatively interfering with STAT1 signaling. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that suppression of BAFF production may be a novel mechanism by which curcumin improves RA. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2012.

Methods: All of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on FTS for colorectal surgery were analyzed with the Cochrane systematic review. Database retrievals of Medline, Embase and Cochrane was were conducted, together with two published FTS meta-analyses. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the studies, extracted the relevant data and performed a cross-check. A metaanalysis was performed with RevMan 5 software. Results: A total of 15 studies were reviewed in this study, including 13 articles in English and 2 articles in Chinese, of which 7 were RCTs and 8 were CCTs. The overall rates of morbidity and readmission in the FTS group were lower compared to patients who underwent the conventional treatments (conventional treatment group or control group) in the RCTs but tended to increase in the CCTs. There were no statistically significant differences between the FTS group and the control group regarding ileus, anastomotic leakage, abdominal distention, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention and infection of the incisional wound. Conclusion: The overall rates of morbidity and readmission in the FTS group were similar or even lower compared to the control group in RCTs, with an increasing trend in the CCTs. Further discussion is needed as to why the results of the RCTs were not repeated in the CCTs, especially with regard to the causes of readmission. It should also be determined whether an early discharge might cause a delay in the diagnosis of some complications, and thereby the occurrence of serious complications. If a number of severe complications occurred due to an early discharge, the value of FTS would be in question. © 2012 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84880610121	Invasion potential of H22 hepatocarcinoma cells is increased by HMGB1-induced tumor NF-κB signaling via initiation of HSP70	The functional relationship and cross-regulation between damage-associated molecular patterns and NF-κB in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. In the present study, high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) was secreted in response to feed second phase of NF-κB activation from heat shock protein (HSP) 70 that may result in a higher invasion potential of hepatocarcinoma cells. HSP70 promoted the proliferation of H22 hepatocarcinoma cells through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 signaling and induced the early phosphorylation of NF-κB, which reached maximum levels within 30 min. However, HSP70 promoted the upregulation of Beclin-1 expression via Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in tumor cells and the release of HMGB1 from tumor cells. Inhibition of Beclin-1/c-JNK production prevented the second, but not the first, phase of NF-κB phosphorylation, implicating Beclin-1/c-JNK in the second phase of phosphorylation. HSP70 induced Beclin-1-derived HMGB1 production at 4 h, which occurred before the rise in the second phosphorylation that occurred at 6 h. Exogenous HMGB1 also induced the rapid phosphorylation of NF-κB and upregulated the expression of MMP-9, inhibited the rapid phosphorylation of NF-κB and reduced MMP-9 by receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) inhibitor that prevented HMGB1-induced cell invasion in vitro, which demonstrated that the biological significance of HMGB1/RAGE is key to the second, but not the first, phase of NF-κB phosphorylation in tumor cells. HSP70 triggered a positive feedback loop of NF-κB activation in H22 cells. The second phase of NF-κB phosphorylation mediated by HSP70 is implicated in the increase of tumor cell malignant invasion.

84880813171	A Comparative Study of Clinicopathological Features between Chronic Cholecystitis Patients with and without Helicobacter pylori Infection in Gallbladder Mucosa	Background:Helicobacter pylori has been isolated from 10%-20% of human chronic cholecystitis specimens but the characteristics of "Helicobacter pylori positive cholecystitis" remains unclear. This study aims to compare the clinicopathological features between chronic cholecystitis patients with and without Helicobacter pylori infection in gallbladder mucosa.Methods:Three hundred and twenty-six chronic cholecystitis patients were divided into two groups according to whether Helicobacter pylori could be detected by culture, staining or PCR for Helicobacter 16s rRNA gene in gallbladder mucosa. Positive samples were sequenced for Helicobacter pylori-specific identification. Clinical parameters as well as pathological characteristics including some premalignant lesions and the expression levels of iNOS and ROS in gallbladder were compared between the two groups.Results:Helicobacter pylori infection in gallbladder mucosa was detected in 20.55% of cholecystitis patients. These patients had a higher prevalence of acid regurgitation symptoms (p = 0.001), more histories of chronic gastritis (p = 0.005), gastric ulcer (p = 0.042), duodenal ulcer (p = 0.026) and higher presence of Helicobacter pylori in the stomach as compared to patients without Helicobacter pylori infection in the gallbladder mucosa. Helicobacter pylori 16s rRNA in gallbladder and gastric-duodenal mucosa from the same individual patient had identical sequences. Also, higher incidences of adenomyomatosis (p = 0.012), metaplasia (p = 0.022) and higher enhanced expressions of iNOS and ROS were detected in Helicobacter pylori infected gallbladder mucosa (p<0.05).Conclusions:Helicobacter pylori infection in gallbladder mucosa is strongly associated with Helicobacter pylori existed in stomach. Helicobacter pylori is also correlated with gallbladder premalignant lesions including metaplasia and adenomyomatosis. The potential mechanism might be related with higher ROS/RNS production but needs further investigation. © 2013 Zhou et al.

84882573999	Expression of Hsp27 correlated with rat detrusor contraction after acute urinary retention	Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) can regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics and contractile protein activation. This study investigates whether Hsp27 expression is related to bladder contractile dysfunction after acute urinary retention (AUR). Female rats were randomized either to AUR by urethral ligation or to normal control group. Bladder and smooth muscle strip contraction at time points from 0 h to 7 days after AUR were estimated by cystometric and organ bath studies. Hsp27 expression in bladder tissue at each time point was detected with immunofluorescence, Western blots, and real-time PCR. Expression of the three phosphorylated forms of Hsp27 was detected by Western blots. Smooth muscle ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Data suggest that maximum detrusor pressure and both carbachol-induced and spontaneous detrusor strip contraction amplitude decreased gradually for the duration from 0 to 6 h, and then increased gradually to near-normal values at 24 h. Treatment of muscle strips with the p38MAK inhibitor, SB203580, inhibited carbacholinduced contractions. Smooth muscle ultrastructure damage was the highest at 6 h after AUR, and then lessened gradually during next 7 days, and ultrastructure was close to normal. Expressions of Hsp27 mRNA and protein and the proteins of the three phosphorylated forms were higher at 0 h, decreased to lower levels up to 6 h, and then gradually increased. Therefore, we conclude that rat bladder contractile function after AUR worsens during 0-6 h, and then gradually recovers. The findings of the current study suggest that Hsp27 modulates bladder smooth muscle contraction after AUR, and that phosphorylation of Hsp27 may be an important pathway modulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics in bladder smooth muscle contraction and reconstruction after injury. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84882719818	Inhibition of the transcription factor Sp1 suppresses colon cancer stem cell growth and induces apoptosis in vitro and in nude mouse xenografts	The transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) plays a role in the development and progression of various types of human cancers, while cancer stem cells (CSCs) are important in cancer cell self-renewal, resistance to chemotherapy and metastatic potential. This study investigated the role of Sp1 in colon CSC growth and apoptosis. Colon CSCs were successfully enriched using special culture medium and identified by typical CSC gene expression. In a quiescent state, these CSCs formed spheres with slow proliferation; overexpressed Sp1, CD44, CD166 and CD133 proteins; upregulated mesenchymal markers; and a downregulated epithelial marker were noted. In ex vivo experiments, the Sp1 protein was expressed in 74.8% of colon cancer tissues, whereas it was expressed only in 42.2% of the distant normal colon mucosae. Furthermore, inhibition of SP1 expression using Sp1 siRNA or mithramycin A (MIT) led to marked suppression of CSC growth and induced apoptosis. In addition, the percentage of CD44+/CD166+ cells was significantly downregulated both in vivo and in vitro following Sp1 inhibition. In conclusion, Sp1 suppression attenuated the characteristics of colon CSCs. Thus, Sp1 inhibition may be potentially useful for the future development of a novel therapeutic strategy to control colon cancer.

84884660965	Candidate microRNA biomarkers of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: Meta-analysis, experimental validation and clinical significance	Background: The diagnostic and prognostic value of microRNA (miRNA) expression aberrations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has been studied extensively in recent years. However, differences in measurement platforms and lab protocols as well as small sample sizes can render gene expression levels incomparable. Methods. A comprehensive meta-review of published studies in PDAC that compared the miRNA expression profiles of PDAC tissues and paired neighbouring noncancerous pancreatic tissues was performed to determine candidate miRNA biomarkers for PDAC. Both a miRNA vote-counting strategy and a recently published Robust Rank Aggregation method were employed. In this review, a total of 538 tumour and 206 noncancerous control samples were included. Results: We identified a statistically significant miRNA meta-signature of seven up- and three down-regulated miRNAs. The experimental validation results showed that the miRNA expression levels were in accordance with the meta-signature. The results from the vote-counting strategy were consistent with those from the Robust Rank Aggregation method. The experimental validation confirmed that the statistically unique profiles identified by the meta-review approach could discriminate PDAC tissues from paired nonmalignant pancreatic tissues. In a cohort of 70 patients, the high expression of miR-21 (p=0.018, HR=2.610; 95% CI=1.179-5.777) and miR-31 (p=0.039, HR=2.735; 95% CI=1.317-6.426), the low expression of miR-375 (p=0.022, HR=2.337; 95% CI=1.431-5.066) were associated with poor overall survival following resection, independent of clinical covariates. Conclusions: The identified miRNAs may be used to develop a panel of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for PDAC with sufficient sensitivity and specificity for use in a clinical setting. © 2013 Ma et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84885072423	Endoplasmic reticulum stress participates in aortic valve calcification in hypercholesterolemic animals	OBJECTIVES - : Aortic valve (AV) calcification occurs via a pathophysiological process that includes lipoprotein deposition, inflammation, and osteoblastic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells. Here, we investigated the association between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and AV calcification. APPROACH AND RESULTS - : We identified ER stress activation in AV of patients with calcified AV stenosis. We generated an AV calcification model in hypercholesterolemic rabbits and mice, respectively, and found marked AV ER stress induction. Classical ER stress inhibitor, tauroursodeoxycholic acid, administration markedly prevented AV calcification, and attenuated AV osteoblastic differentiation and inflammation in both rabbit and mouse models of AV calcification via inhibition of ER stress. In cultured valvular interstitial cells (VICs), we found that oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) caused ER stress in a cytosolic [Ca]i-dependent manner. OxLDL promoted osteoblastic differentiation via ER stress-mediated protein kinase-like ER kinase/activating transcription factor 4/osteocalcin and inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase and endonuclease-1α (IRE1α)/spliced X-box-binding protein 1/Runx2 pathway, and induced inflammatory responses through IRE1α/c-Jun N-terminal kinase and IRE1α/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells signaling in VICs. Inhibition of ER stress by either tauroursodeoxycholic acid or 4-phenyl butyric acid could both suppress oxLDL-induced osteoblastic differentiation and inflammatory responses in VICs. CONCLUSIONS - : These data provide novel evidence that ER stress participates in AV calcification development, and suggest that ER stress may be a novel target for AV calcification prevention and treatment. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.

84887083722	Upregulation of thrombomodulin expression by activation of farnesoid X receptor in vascular endothelial cells	Thrombomodulin (TM) serves as a vasoprotective molecule on the surface of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) to maintain the endothelial microenvironment by suppressing cellular proliferation, adhesion and inflammatory responses. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor (NR) and originally considered as a bile acid-activated transcriptional factor, not only regulates metabolism homeostasis, but also influences cholesterol transport, vascular tension, and inflammation. Recent studies have shown that TM expression is upregulated by several NRs. However, it is unknown whether there is a link between FXR and TM. Our studies demonstrated that TM expression and activity were up-regulated by FXR activation in VECs. Reporter assays showed that FXR activation significantly enhanced the transcriptional activity of human TM gene promoter. Elecrophoretic mobility-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that FXR induced TM expression by binding to a novel FXR-responsive element (FXRE), an inverted repeat DNA motif, IR8 (-503 AGGTCCtcccaaagTGCCCT-484) in the promoter region of TM gene. These results suggest that FXR may serve as a novel molecular target for manipulating TM expression and activity in VECs, which may be helpful for designing the therapeutic strategies to the treatment of associated diseases by targeting FXR/TM pathway. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

0041816084	Dynamics of liver granuloma and the relative changes of Th1/Th2 cytokine levels in mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum	Purpose: To oberve the dynamics of liver granuloma and the relative changes of Th1/Th2 cytokine levels in mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum, and investigate the role of Th1/Th2 in S. japontcum granuloma formation and regulation. Methods: Liver granuloma measurement were performed by histological examination and the ELISA were used for the quantitative determination of IL-2, IFNγ and IL-4 in murine serum and spleen lymphocyte culture medium at 0,4,6,8,10 and 12 wk after infection. Results: At 6 wk liver granuloma formation appeared and at 8 wk liver granuloma peaked. After 12 wk liver granuhoma diminished obviously. Meanwhile, at 4 - 6 wk IL-2, IFNγ and IL-4 began to rise, at 8 wk the levels of Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFNγ peaked and then declined, and at 8 wk the levels of Th2 cytokines IL -4 were rapidly enhanced and increased obviously with a prolongation of the infection duration. Conclusions: The Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFNγ were correlated well with S. japonicum granuloma formation and vigour, and the Th2 cytokines IL-4 might play an important role in down-regulating egg granuloma reaction at chronic schistosomiasis by inhibiting the Th1 cytokines.

84891109626	Proximal gastrectomy versus total gastrectomy for proximal gastric carcinoma: A meta-analysis on postoperative complications, 5-year survival, and recurrence rate	Objectives: To compare proximal gastrectomy (PG) with total gastrectomy (TG) for proximal gastric carcinoma, through the 5-year survival rate, recurrence rate, postoperative complications, and long-term life quality. Methods: The meta-analysis was carried out in the General Surgery Department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. We searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from June to November 2012. The literature searches were carried out using medical subject headings and free-text word: "proximal gastrectomy" "total gastrectomy" "partial gastrectomy" "stomach neoplasms" and "gastric cancer". Two different reviewers carried out the search and evaluated studies independently. Results: Two randomized controlled trials and 9 retrospective studies were included. A total of 1364 patients were included in our study. Our analysis showed that there is no statistically significant difference in 5-year survival rate between PG and TG (60.9% versus 64.4%). But, the recurrence is higher in the PG group than the TG (38.7% versus 24.4%). The anastomotic stenosis rate is also higher in the PG than the TG (27.4% versus 7.4%). Conclusion: Proximal gastrectomy is an option for upper third gastric cancer in terms of safety. However, it is associated with high risk of reflux symptoms and anastomotic stenosis. Therefore, TG should be the first choice for proximal gastric cancer to prevent reflux symptoms.

Animal models were treated with capecitabine and/or simvastatin and low-, middle-, high- dose of onion's extraction and both tumor growth rate and blood lipid levels were monitored. Results: We found that colorectal cancer in onion's extraction groups was significantly inhibited, and the effect of high dose of onion's extraction was equivalent to capecitabine. Onion's extraction effectively decreased levels of apoB and TC. Conclusion: Our study established a hyperlipidemia colon tumor model involving subcutaneous colon translocation and orthotopic transplantation, this model was an ideal research model for mutual influence of hyperlipidemia and colorectal cancer. Onion's extraction could inhibit the proliferation of colorectal cancer; the function of the high-dose of onion's extraction was fairly to capecitabine, which provided a new direction in protecting and treating colorectal cancer. © 2014 He et al.

84892187309	A novel subcutaneous infusion delivery system based on osmotic pump: In vitro and in vivo evaluation	An economical, convenient portable drug delivery system combining osmotic pump with subcutaneous infusion was developed, which was composed of three primary components: water chamber, osmotic pump chamber and support base. Ceftriaxone sodium (CRO) was selected as the model drug and osmotic pump tablets were prepared. The influence of osmotic agents on drug release profiles was evaluated. As the adjustment made by the osmotic agents was limited, the compositions of semipermeable membrane were investigated to determine significant associations of factors based on orthogonal design. The in vitro release profiles of the optimum formulation achieved to the predetermined value (15 ± 3 min for the initial release time Ti and 5.75 ± 0.25 h for the extent release time Te). The pharmacokinetic profiles of this drug delivery system were evaluated in Beagle dogs. In vivo results demonstrated that the osmotic pump subcutaneous infusion administration was equivalent to intravenous injection administration in terms of bioavailability. Moreover, constant drug plasma levels with minimized fluctuations could be achieved with this osmotic pump subcutaneous infusion system, compared with intravenous injection. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

84892415111	SN50 enhances the effects of LY294002 on cell death induction in gastric cancer cell line SGC7901	Introduction: In the previous study, we found that the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) by LY294002 induced SGC7901 cell death in vitro. We did not know whether SN50, which is a specific inhibitor of nuclear factor êB (NF-êB), could increase the cell death induction of gastric cancer of LY294002 in vitro, and we also wanted to know the mechanism of it, which might be applied to clinical tumor therapy. Material and methods: The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetra zolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to determine the cytotoxic effects of the drugs. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using the fluorescent probe JC-1. Hoechst 33258 staining was used to detect apoptosis and necrosis morphological changes after LY294002 and/or SN50 treatment. Expression of p53, PUMA and Beclin1 were determined with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. We used transmission electron microscopy to identify ultrastructural changes in SGC7901 cells after LY294002 and/or SN50 treatment. Results: In this study, we found that treating the human gastric cancer cells SGC7901 with SN50 could significantly enhance the effects of LY294002 on inducing cell death after 24 h, compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Detection of mitochondrial potential and transmission electron microscopic examination indicated that the rate of cell death increased progressively. The expression of p53, PUMA and Beclin1 was up-regulated. Conclusions: The NF-êB inhibitor SN50 could enhance the role of LY294002 on inducing cell death of human gastric cancer cells SGC7901, which might be a promising new approach to gastric cancer therapy.

84894521405	The toll-like receptor 3 Ligand, Poly(I:C), improves immunosuppressive function and therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells on sepsis via inhibiting MiR-143	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attractive candidates for clinical therapeutic applications. Recent studies indicate MSCs express active Toll-like receptors (TLRs), but their effect on MSCs and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that, after treating human umbilical cord MSCs with various TLR ligands, only TLR3 ligand, poly(I:C), could significantly increase the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Furthermore, poly(I:C) could enhance MSCs' anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages. Next, we focused on the regulatory roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the process of poly(I:C) activating MSCs. Our experiments indicated that miR-143 expression was significantly decreased in MSCs with poly(I:C) treatment, and the expression level of miR-143 could regulate the effect of poly(I:C) on MSCs' immunosuppressive function. Subsequent results showed that the reporter genes with putative miR-143 binding sites from the transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) and COX-2 30 untranslated regions were downregulated in the presence of miR-143. In addition, mRNA and protein expression of TAK1 and COX-2 in MSCs was also downregulated with miR-143 overexpression, suggesting that TAK1 and COX-2 are target genes of miR-143 in MSCs. Consistent with miR-143 overexpression, TAK1 interference also attenuated MSCs' immunosuppressive function enhanced by poly(I:C). Additionally, it was shown that TLR3-activated MSCs could improve survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, while miR-143 overexpression reduced the effectiveness of this therapy. These results proved that poly(I:C) improved the immunosuppressive abilities of MSCs, revealed the regulatory role of miRNAs in the process, and may provide an opportunity for potential novel therapies for sepsis. © AlphaMed Press 2013.

84896309028	FC-98 regulates TLR9-mediated of CXCL-10 expression in dendritic cells via MAPK and STAT1 signaling pathway	Dendritic cells (DCs), as the most potent professional antigen presenting cells, play a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immune systems. Genomic bacterial DNA mimicked by unmethylated CpG motifs is discovered to possess immunostimulatory effects. CpG-DNA recognized by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) on DCs arouses many immune diseases (such as cancer, viral infection, and autoimmune disorders). In this study we investigated the effects of FC-98 on CpG-induced bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs). The results showed that FC-98 significantly inhibited the CpG-induced BMDCs maturation and function by suppressing the expression of surface markers (CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHCII). Moreover, FC-98 downregulated the expression of C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL-10) both at the mRNA and protein level after CpG induction. Meanwhile, FC-98 markedly affected the migration of BMDCs to T cells without affecting their endocytosis capacity. Furthermore, FC-98 was confirmed to decrease CXCL-10 expression by inhibiting CpG-induced activation of MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) and STAT1 signaling. Overall, these results suggested that FC-98 was a potential molecule in the treatment of CXCL-10-mediated immune diseases. © 2014 Yonghong Yang et al.

84896759012	PEGylated liposomes with NGR ligand and heat-activable cell-penetrating peptide-doxorubicin conjugate for tumor-specific therapy	Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) mediated tumor-oriented nanocarriers have been widely studied by researchers recently. However, applications of CPPs in vivo were usually hampered by their loss in untargeted tissues and enzymatic degradation. These shortfalls required strategies to camouflage CPPs before their arrival at the targeted site. In this work, we constructed a thermosensitive liposome (TSL) containing Asparagines-Glycine-Arginine (NGR) peptide as the targeting moiety and heat-activable cell-penetrating peptide-doxorubicin conjugate for enhancing specific cancer therapy. Different to the masking strategies of CPPs reported, CPPs existing in conjugation form of CPPs and doxorubicin (CPP-Dox) were hidden in TSL to cloak and protect CPPs. Meanwhile, NGR moiety and local tumor hyperthermia were utilized to achieve specific targeting of CPPs to the tumor. The nanocarrier (CPP-Dox/NGR-TSL) prepared in this work possessed suitable physiochemical properties such as small particle size of about 90 nm, high drug encapsulation efficiency of approximately 95%, good stability in the medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and so on. In vitro experiments on Human fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080) and human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7) verified the specific targeting ability and enhanced intracellular drug delivery of the liposomes to HT-1080 cells. Furthermore, comparing with NGR-targeted TSL containing Dox (Dox/NGR-TSL), the results of intravenous administration showed CPP-Dox/NGR-TSL significantly inhibited tumor growth in nude mice xenografted HT-1080 tumors and excellent body safety. In conclusion, the nanocarrier constructed in this study would be a safe and efficiently drug delivery system for specific cancer treatment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84897481258	Functional analysis LRP6 novel mutations in patients with coronary artery disease	Background: Genetic architecture of coronary artery disease (CAD) is still to be defined. Since low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) gene play critical roles in Wnt signal transduction which are important for vascular development and endodermis specification, we therefore resequenced it to search for mutations in CAD patients. Methods: We systemically sequenced all the exons and promoter region of LRP6 gene in a sample of 380 early onset CAD patients and 380 control subjects in Chinese. Results: In total, we identified 5 patient-specific mutations including K82N (two patients), S488Y (one patient), P1066T (two patients), P1206H (two patients) and I1264V (one patient) All these mutations located at the extracellular domain of LRP6 gene. In vitro functional analysis of patient-specific mutations demonstrated that these mutations resulted in a significant reduction in both protein level transporting to cell membrane and downstream Wnt signal activity. Furthermore, we found that LRP6 novel mutations attenuated proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) when compared with wild type (WT) LRP6. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that these loss-of-function variants might contribute to disease liability in a subset of CAD and defects in Wnt signal activation might be important contributing factors for the onset of CAD. © 2014 Xu et al.

84898903996	The inhibitory effects of deleted in liver cancer 1 gene on gallbladder cancer growth through induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis	Background and Aim: The biological function of tumor suppressor deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) has been investigated in several types of human cancer, but its role in gallbladder cancer (GBC) is yet to be determined. In this research, we conducted in vitro and in vivo analysis to evaluate the inhibitory activities of DLC1 gene against GBC growth. Methods: DLC1 expression in GBC tissues and cell lines was examined by immunohistochemical staining, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot assay. The in vitro and in vivo effects of ectopic DLC1 expression on cell growth were evaluated. In addition, the effects of ectopic DLC1 expression on cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration were also evaluated. The expressions of cell cycle-related and apoptosis-related proteins were examined. Results: The downregulation of DLC1 expression was a common event in GBC tissues and cell lines. Restoration of DLC1 expression in GBC-SD and NOZ cells significantly reduced cell proliferation, migration in vitro, and the ability of these cells to form tumors in vivo. Restoration of DLC1 expression arrested GBC-SD and NOZ cells in G0/G1 phase through inducing p21 in a p53-independent manner. In addition, restoration of DLC1 expression induced extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway through promoting the expressions of Fas L/FADD, Bax, cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-8, -9, -3, and cleaved poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase and suppressing bcl-2 expression in GBC-SD and NOZ cells. Conclusions: Our findings suggested that dysregulated expression of DLC1 is involved in proliferation and invasion of GBC cells and may serve as a potential therapeutic target. © 2013 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84899475560	Targeting gallbladder cancer: Oncolytic virotherapy with myxoma virus is enhanced by rapamycin in vitro and further improved by hyaluronan in vivo	Background: Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is highly lethal, and effective treatment will require synergistic anti-tumor management. The study is aimed at investigating the oncolytic value of myxoma virus (MYXV) infection against GBC and optimizing MYXV oncolytic efficiency. Methods: We examined the permissiveness of GBC cell lines to MYXV infection and compared the effects of MYXV on cell viability among GBC and control permissive glioma cells in vitro and in vivo after MYXV + rapamycin (Rap) treatment, which is known to enhance cell permissiveness to MYXV by upregulating p-Akt levels. We also assessed MYXV + hyaluronan (HA) therapy efficiency by examinating Akt activation status, MMP-9 expression, cell viability, and collagen distribution. We further compared hydraulic conductivity, tumor area, and survival of tumor-bearing mice between the MYXV + Rap and MYXV + HA therapeutic regimens. Results: MYXV + Rap treatment could considerably increase the oncolytic ability of MYXV against GBC cell lines in vitro but not against GBC xenografts in vivo. We found higher levels of collagen IV in GBC tumors than in glioma tumors. Diffusion analysis demonstrated that collagen IV could physically hinder MYXV intratumoral distribution. HA-CD44 interplay was found to activate the Akt signaling pathway, which increases oncolytic rates. HA was also found to enhance the MMP-9 secretion, which contributes to collagen IV degradation. Conclusions: Unlike MYXV + Rap, MYXV + HA therapy significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effects of MYXV in vivo and prolonged survival of GBC tumor-bearing mice. HA may optimize the oncolytic effects of MYXV on GBC via the HA-CD44 interaction which can promote viral infection and diffusion. © 2014 Weng et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84902072526	STK11 Domain XI Mutations: Candidate Genetic Drivers Leading to the Development of Dysplastic Polyps in Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome	Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare hereditary disorder resulting from mutations in serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) and characterized by gastrointestinal (GI) hamartomatous polyps, mucocutaneous pigmentation, and an increased risk for specific cancers. Little is known about the genetic implications of specific STK11 mutations with regard to their role in dysplastic and malignant transformation of GI polyps. Peripheral blood genomic DNA samples from 116 Chinese PJS patients from 52 unrelated families were investigated for STK11 mutations. Genotype-phenotype correlations were investigated. The mutation detection rate was 67.3% (51.9% point mutations, 15.4% large deletions). Fourteen out of the 25 point mutations identified were novel. Nearly one-third of all mutations, 8/27 (29.6%), were in exon 7, the shortest out of the nine exons. Strikingly, mutations affecting protein kinase domain XI, encoded in part by exon 7, correlated with a 90% (9/10) incidence of GI polyp dysplasia. In contrast, only two out of 17 (11.8%) nondomain XI mutations were linked to polyp dysplasia (P = 0.0001). The extent of the association between dysplasia and the development of GI-related cancers is currently unknown but our results highlight a novel STK11 genotype-phenotype association as the basis for future genetic counseling and basic research studies. © 2014 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.

84902449591	Targeting gallbladder carcinoma: Bone marrow-derived stem cells as therapeutic delivery vehicles of myxoma virus	Background Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) has a high mortality rate, requiring synergistic anti-tumor management for effective treatment. The myxoma virus (MYXV) exhibits a modest clinical value through its oncolytic potential and narrow host tropism. Methods We performed viral replication assays, cell viability assays, migration assays, and xenograft tumor models to demonstrate that bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) may enhance efficiency of intravenous MYXV delivery. Results We examined the permissiveness of various GBC cell lines towards MYXV infection and found two supported single and multiple rounds of MYXV replication, leading to an oncolytic effect. Furthermore, we found that BMSCs exhibited tropism for GBC cells within a Matrigel migration system. BMSCs failed to affect the growth of GBC cells, in terms of tumor volume and survival time. Finally, we demonstrated in vivo that intravenous injection of MYXV-infected BMSCs significantly improves the oncolytic effect of MYXV alone, almost to the same extent as intratumoral injection of MYXV. Conclusion This study indicates that BMSCs are a promising novel vehicle for MYXV to clinically address gallbladder tumors.

84902193241	UHRF1 depletion suppresses growth of gallbladder cancer cells through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest	Ubiquitin-like containing PHD and RING finger domains 1 (UHRF1), overexpressed in various human malignancies, functions as an important regulator in cell proliferation and epigenetic regulation. Depletion of UHRF1 has shown potential antitumor activities in several types of cancer. However, the role of UHRF1 in gallbladder cancer (GBC) has not been investigated. RT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to examine UHRF1 expression at mRNA and protein levels in GBC tissues and cell lines. UHRF1 siRNA and UHRF1 shRNA were used to deplete the expression of UHRF1. The results showed that UHRF1 was overexpressed in GBC and its expression correlated with advanced TNM stage and presence of lymph node metastasis. UHRF1 depletion in GBC-SD and NOZ cells markedly inhibited proliferation, migration in vitro and the ability of these cells to form tumors in vivo. UHRF1 depletion upregulated the expression of PML and triggered extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways by promoting the expression of FasL/FADD, bax, cytosolic cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-8, -9 and -3 and cleaved PRAP and by suppressing bcl-2 expression in GBC-SD and NOZ cells. In addition, UHRF1 depletion induced cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition by inducing p21 in a p53-independent manner in GBC-SD and NOZ cells. Our findings suggest that UHRF1 is involved in the proliferation and migration of GBC cells and may serve as a biomarker or even a therapeutic target for GBC.

84901819312	LXRα-mediated downregulation of FOXM1 suppresses the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells	Liver X receptors (LXRs), including LXRα and LXRβ isoforms, have important roles in the metabolic regulation of glucose, cholesterol and lipid. Moreover, activation of LXRs also represses the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin B1, and thus suppresses the proliferation of multiple cancer cells, but the relevant mechanism is not well known. Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is a proliferation-specific member of forkhead box family, which is highly expressed in proliferating normal cells and numerous cancer cells. FOXM1 directly activates transcription of cyclin D1 and cyclin B1, resulting in the enhancement of cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. However, it is unclear whether LXRs are involved in the regulation of FOXM1. In this study, we demonstrated that specific LXRs agonists downregulated expression of FOXM1, cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, which led to cell cycle and cell proliferation arrest. Knockdown of FOXM1 significantly alleviated LXRs activation-mediated cell cycle arrest and cell growth suppression. Reporter assays showed that the activation of LXRs significantly reduced the transcriptional activity of FOXM1 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that LXRα but not LXRβ could bind to an inverted repeat IR2 (-52CCGTCAcgTGACCT-39) in the promoter region of FOXM1 gene. Moreover, the xenograft tumor growth and the corresponding FOXM1 expression in nude mice were dramatically repressed by LXRs agonists. Taken together, we conclude that LXRα but not LXRβ functions as a transcriptional repressor for FOXM1 expression. The pathway 'LXRα-FOXM1-cyclin D1/cyclin B1' is a novel mechanism by which LXRs suppress the proliferation of HCC cells, suggesting that the pathway may be a novel target for HCC treatment. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84902760639	Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR, a c-Myc activated driver of malignancy, negatively regulates miRNA-130a in gallbladder cancer	Background: Protein coding genes account for only about 2% of the human genome, whereas the vast majority of transcripts are non-coding RNAs including long non-coding RNAs. A growing volume of literature has proposed that lncRNAs are important players in cancer. HOTAIR was previously shown to be an oncogene and negative prognostic factor in a variety of cancers. However, the factors that contribute to its upregulation and the interaction between HOTAIR and miRNAs are largely unknown.Methods: A computational screen of HOTAIR promoter was conducted to search for transcription-factor-binding sites. HOTAIR promoter activities were examined by luciferase reporter assay. The function of the c-Myc binding site in the HOTAIR promoter region was tested by a promoter assay with nucleotide substitutions in the putative E-box. The association of c-Myc with the HOTAIR promoter in vivo was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. A search for miRNAs with complementary base paring with HOTAIR was performed utilizing online software program. Gain and loss of function approaches were employed to investigate the expression changes of HOTAIR or miRNA-130a. The expression levels of HOTAIR, c-Myc and miRNA-130a were examined in 65 matched pairs of gallbladder cancer tissues. The effects of HOTAIR and miRNA-130a on gallbladder cancer cell invasion and proliferation was tested using in vitro cell invasion and flow cytometric assays.Results: We demonstrate that HOTAIR is a direct target of c-Myc through interaction with putative c-Myc target response element (RE) in the upstream region of HOTAIR in gallbladder cancer cells. A positive correlation between c-Myc and HOTAIR mRNA levels was observed in gallbladder cancer tissues. We predicted that HOTAIR harbors a miRNA-130a binding site. Our data showed that this binding site is vital for the regulation of miRNA-130a by HOTAIR. Moreover, a negative correlation between HOTAIR and miRNA-130a was observed in gallbladder cancer tissues. Finally, we demonstrate that the oncogenic activity of HOTAIR is in part through its negative regulation of miRNA-130a.Conclusion: Together, these results suggest that HOTAIR is a c-Myc-activated driver of malignancy, which acts in part through repression of miRNA-130a. © 2014 Ma et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84902951737	Preparation, characterization, and pharmacodynamics of thermosensitive liposomes containing docetaxel	A novel thermosensitive liposome (TL) containing docetaxel (DTX) was designed to enhance DTX-targeted delivery and antitumor effect. TL loading DTX (DTX-TL) were prepared by thin film hydration. The mean particle size of the liposomes was about 100 nm, and the drug entrapment efficiency was more than 95%. The phase transition temperature of liposomes was about 42C. In vitro drug release showed that drug released at 37C was obviously less than that at 42C. For in vivo experiments, the human breast tumor model was established by subcutaneous xenotransplantation on nude mice; liposomes and injection containing DTX were injected i.v. in nude mice, followed by exposure of the tumors to hyperthermia (HT) for 30 min after administration. The tumor inhibition ratio of DTX-TL group was significantly higher than the normal injection group. Combining TL with HT enhanced the delivery of DTX and thereby its antitumor effects. The liposomes reported in this paper could potentially produce viable clinical strategies for improved targeting and delivery of DTX for the treatment of breast cancer. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 103:2177-2183, 2014 © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.

84902984014	Effects of AFP-activated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway on cell proliferation of liver cancer	This study aims to investigate effects of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway on hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation. Active cirrhosis patients after hepatitis B infection (n=20) and viral hepatitis patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n=20) were selected as the subjects of the present study. Another 20 healthy subjects were selected as the control group. The serum AFP expression and liver tissue PI3K and Akt gene mRNA expression were detected. The hepatoma cell model HepG2 which had a stable expression of AFP genewas used. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot and other methods were used to analyze the intracellular PI3K and Akt protein levels. Compared with control group and cirrhosis group, the serum AFP levels in HCC group significantly increased, and the tissue PI3K and Akt mRNA expression also significantly increased. HepG2 cells were intervened using AFP, in which the PIK and Akt protein expression significantly increased. After intervention by use of AFP monoclonal antibodies or LY294002 inhibitor, the PIK and Akt protein expression in HepG2 cell was significantly decreased (P<0.05). AFP can promote the proliferation of hepatoma cells via activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. © International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM) 2014.

84903889137	Study on pharmacodynamics and biodistribution of vinorelbine bitartrate thermosensitive liposomes	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the tissue distribution and pharmacodynamics of vinorelbine bitartrate thermosensitive liposomes. METHODS: Subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model of human ovarian carcinoma SK-OV-3 in nude mice was established. The tumor inhibitory efficacy and biodistribution of drug were evaluated in nude mice by intravenous ad-minstration with vinorelbine bitartrate thermosensitive liposomes and vinorelbine bitartrate injection. RESULTS: The inhibition rate of vinorelbine bitartrate thermosensitive liposomes was remarkably higher than that of injection at same dose. Moreover, The drug concentration in heated tumor of mice administrated with vinorelbine bitartrate thermosensitive liposomes was a-bout 4 fold compared with that of mice administrated with injection. CONCLUSION: Vinorelbine bitartrate thermosensitive liposomes combined with hyperthermia could significantly increase drug concentration in local tumor tissue and promote tumor inhibitory efficacy.

84904517680	Differentiation therapy: Sesamin as an effective agent in targeting cancer stem-like side population cells of human gallbladder carcinoma	Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that side population (SP) cells isolated from various cancer cell lines and primary tumors possess stem cell-like properties. Sesamin, a food-derived agent, possesses anti-cancer activities both in vitro and in vivo. The present study was designed to determine whether sesamin also have effects on cancer stem-like SP cells from gallbladder cancer (GBC).Methods: In this study, we sorted SP cells by flow cytometry. SP cells were cultured and treated with sesamin. Tumor-sphere formation, colony formation, Matrigel invasion and tumorigenic potential were determined. Expression of nuclear NF-κB, IL-6, p-Stat3, Twist, E-cadherin and Vimentin was measured by Western blot, immunofluorescence staining or RT-PCR analysis. Nuclear NF-κB activity and IL-6 protein level were assessed with ELISA. Xenograft tumors were generated in nude mice.Results: After treated with sesamin, SP cells differentiated into cells expressing the epithelial marker (E-cadherin). Sesamin effectively affected SP cells stem cell-like characteristics (i.e., tumor-sphere formation, colony-formation, Matrigel invasion), weakened the drug-resistance of SP cells and inhibited tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with sesamin significantly reduced the expression of nuclear NF-κB, IL-6, p-Stat3, Twist and Vimentin (a mesenchymal marker) in SP cells. Nuclear NF-κB activity and IL-6 level were also decreased after treatment with sesamin.Conclusion: Food-derived sesamin directs the epithelial differentiation of cancer stem-like SP cells from GBC, which is associated with attenuation of NF-κB-IL-6-Stat3-Twist signal pathway. © 2014 Kong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84904263678	Forkhead box L1 is frequently downregulated in gallbladder cancer and inhibits cell growth through apoptosis induction by mitochondrial dysfunction	Background: Forkhead box L1 (FOXL1), considered as a novel candidate tumor suppressor, suppresses proliferation and invasion in certain cancers. However, the regulation and function of FOXL1 in gallbladder cancer (GBC) remains unclear. Methods: FOXL1 expression at mRNA and protein levels in GBC tissues and cell lines were examined by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blot assay. FOXL1 expression in GBC cell lines was up-regulated by transfection with pcDNA-FOXL1. The effects of FOXL1 overexpression on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were evaluated in vitro or in vivo. In addition, the status of mediators involved in migration, invasion and apoptosis was examined using western blot after transfection with pcDNA-FOXL1. Results: FOXL1 was frequently downregulated in GBC tissues and cell lines. Its higher expression is associated with better prognosis, while its lower expression is correlated with advanced TNM stage and poor differentiation. FOXL1 overexpression in NOZ cells significantly suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and tumorigenicity in nude mice. FOXL1 overexpression disrupted mitochondrial transmembrane potential and triggered mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in NOZ cells. In addition, FOXL1 overexpression suppressed ZEB1 expression and induced E-cadherin expression in NOZ cells. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that dysregulated FOXL1 is involved in tumorigenesis and progression of GBC and may serve as a predictor of clinical outcome or even a therapeutic target for patients with GBC. © 2014 Qin et al.

84904464789	Using thermosensitive chemotherapy agent to improve the effect of radiofrequency ablation for liver tumors: An animal experiment	Objective: To investigate the pathologic mechanism of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with intravenous infusion of thermosensitive liposome encapsulated vinorelbine (TL-Vin) in treating liver tumors, and to analyze the effect of combination therapy on the long-term survival rate. Methods: H22 liver adenocarcinoma tissue was subcutaneously implanted into ICR mice to establish the animal models. At the first experimental period, 40 mice were randomly and equally divided into 5 groups to receive different therapeutic scheme (using different TL-Vin concentrations). Twenty-four hours after the treatment the tumor specimens were collected, the necrotic areas were measured separately, and the optimal TL-Vin concentration was determined. At the second experimental period, 13 mice were randomly selected to receive treatment. Half an hour after the treatment the tumor tissues were collected and the TL-Vin concentration within the tumor was determined. At the third experimental period, 32 mice were randomly and equally divided into 4 groups, and 90 days after treatment the tumor growth curve was drawn. The survival rate was compared between each other of the groups. Results: Compared with pure RFA group, TL-Vin + RFA significantly increased tumor coagulation extent (P < 0.01). But free-VIN + RFA had similar tumor necrotic extent as that produced by RFA alone (P > 0.05). Tumor coagulation area in TL-Vin + RFA group was bigger than that in free-VIN + RFA group at the concentration of 10 mg/kg [(341.8 ± 65.4)mm

84905721813	Whole-exome and targeted gene sequencing of gallbladder carcinoma identifies recurrent mutations in the ErbB pathway	Individuals with gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), the most aggressive malignancy of the biliary tract, have a poor prognosis. Here we report the identification of somatic mutations for GBC in 57 tumor-normal pairs through a combination of exome sequencing and ultra-deep sequencing of cancer-related genes. The mutation pattern is defined by a dominant prevalence of C>T mutations at TCN sites. Genes with a significant frequency (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) of non-silent mutations include TP53 (47.1%), KRAS (7.8%) and ERBB3 (11.8%). Moreover, ErbB signaling (including EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, ERBB4 and their downstream genes) is the most extensively mutated pathway, affecting 36.8% (21/57) of the GBC samples. Multivariate analyses further show that cases with ErbB pathway mutations have a worse outcome (P = 0.001). These findings provide insight into the somatic mutational landscape in GBC and highlight the key role of the ErbB signaling pathway in GBC pathogenesis. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.

84907193859	Statin use and risk of liver cancer: An update meta-analysis	Objective: Statins are commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs. Preclinical studies suggest that statins may possess cancer preventive properties. The primary objective of this meta-analysis was to determine the association between statin use and risk of liver cancer. Design: Meta-analysis. Setting: International. Participants: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, BIOSIS Previews, Web of Science, EMBASE, EBSCO and Cochrane Library was conducted through March 2014. The effect estimate was reported as pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs, using the random-effects model.

84909587664	Risk factors associated with missed colorectal flat adenoma: A multicenter retrospective tandem colonoscopy study	AIM: To determine the miss rate for colorectal flat adenomas during colonoscopy and the risk factors. METHODS: Flat adenomas are frequently missed during colonoscopy. However, the risk factors that influence their miss rates are unclear. This was a multicenter, retrospective study in which patients diagnosed with colorectal adenomas at a diagnostic colonoscopy and followed within 3 mo by a second therapeutic colonoscopy were pooled out from the established database. The "per-patient" and "per-adenoma" adenoma miss rates (AMR) for overall adenomas and flat adenomas, and patient-, adenoma-, and procedure-related risk factors potentially associated with the "per-adenoma" AMR for flat adenomas were determined. RESULTS: Chromoscopy and high-definition colonoscopy were not taken under consideration in the study. Among 2093 patients with colorectal adenomas, 691 (33.0%) were diagnosed with flat adenomas, 514 with concomitant protruding adenomas and 177 without. The "per-patient" AMR for flat adenomas was 43.3% (299/691); the rates were 54.3% and 11.3%, respectively, for those with protruding adenomas and those without (OR = 9.320, 95%CI: 5.672-15.314, χ<sup>2</sup> = 99.084, P < 0.001). The "per-adenoma" AMR for flat adenomas was 44.3% (406/916). In multivariate analysis, older age, presence of concomitant protruding adenomas, poor bowel preparation, smaller adenoma size, location at the right colon, insufficient experience of the colonoscopist, and withdrawal time < 6 min were associated with an increased "per-adenoma" AMR for flat adenomas. The AMR for flat adenomas was moderately correlated with that for overall adenomas (r = 0.516, P < 0.0001). The AMR for flat adenomas during colonoscopy was high. CONCLUSION: Patient's age, concomitant protruding adenomas, bowel preparation, size and location of adenomas, proficiency of the colonoscopist, and withdrawal time are factors affecting the "per-adenoma" AMR for flat adenomas.

84908407689	A novel small-molecule compound diaporine A inhibits non-small cell lung cancer growth by regulating miR-99a/mTOR signaling	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) dysregulation is critically involved in lung cancer. Regulating miRNAs by natural agents may be a new strategy for cancer treatment. We previously found that a novel small-molecule compound diaporine A (D261), a natural product of endophytic fungus 3lp -10, had potential anti-cancer activites. In the present study, the inhibitory effect of D261 on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) growth and its possible mechanisms involving miRNA regulation were investigated. By cell viability assay, cell proliferation analysis, and clonal growth assay, we proved that D261 effectively inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC cells (NCI-H460 and A549) in vitro. Administration of D261 (5 mg/kg) to NCI-H460 xenografts bearing mice also inhibited tumor growth and decreased the expression of cell proliferation regulator, midkine. Moreover, D261 induced cell cycle arrest with a reduced expression of various G

Murine spleen lymphocyte cultures were made at 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks after infection of the mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum. The cultures were incubated with anti-CD80mAb, anti-CD86mAb, anti-CD40mAb and anti-CD40LmAb for 72 h. The kits of ELISA were used for the quantitative determination IFN-y and IL-4 in the spleen lymphocyte culture medium. The results of analysis by the Th2 differentiation index that used to evaluate the immune balance of Th1/Th2 cells. The results showed that anti-CD80mAb and anti-CD86mAb can significantly inhibit the expression of IL-4 (p < 0.01), and the effect of anti-CD86mAb is more significant than that of anti-CD80mAb. Anti-CD40mAb and anti-CD40LmAb can also significantly inhibit the expression of IL-4 (p < 0.01), and the effect of anti-CD40mAb is more significant than that of anti-CD40LmAb. These findings suggest that the interference of costimulatory signals can modulate Thl/Th2 cytokine expression levels and immune deviation in the mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum. A novel potential approach is to control the egg granuloma formation of Schistosoma japonicum by B7 or CD40 as a mediator of Th1/Th2 immune deviation.
