13944267584	Response time measurement for a filter-X-ray diode detection system	The detection system consists of filter, XRD, SUJ-50-10 cable and different band oscillograph. 20 TW laser facility of Shanghai Laser Unite Laboratory with energy about 20 J, pulse width about 1 ps was used, and Au foil target irradiated by laser pulse produced X-ray emission. Note oscillograph type have TK684C, TK694C and WM8500. The linear fit and comparison analysis of experiment data are proceeded. The response time of a filter-XRD detection system become fast along with based voltage, and become slow along with cable length. Therefore, when fast signal is measured, voltage of detector must be increased, and cable length must be shorten, and high band oscillograph be selected, in order to reduce system response time and decrease signal distortion.

21444440933	X-ray calorimeters used for measurement in laser-fusion experiments	X-ray calorimeters are ready to measure the total soft X-ray energy emitted from the plasma produced by laser because of their bodily absorption, linear response, insensitivity to the electromagnetic disturbance, and so on. The calorimeters mainly include absorbers, thermocouples, bases and shrouds. When X-rays are deposited in the absorbers, photon energy absorbed is quickly converted into intrinsic energy which simultaneously dissipates by thermal conduction and radiation. The X-ray calorimeters were absolutely on-line calibrated in Shenguang-II laser facility with the X-ray diode array spectrometer which has been absolutely calibrated on Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. 20 shots' experimental results show that the X-ray calorimeters are stable, the sensitivity of calorimeter is (84.1 + 3.4) μV/mJ and the related combined standard uncertainty in the X-ray energy measure is about 31%. The calorimeters can be applied to measure the X-ray energy.

The reradiated x-ray flux through the laser entrance hole was measured using a soft x-ray spectrometer. The measured peak radiation temperature was 170 eV for the standard hohlraum and 150 eV for the 1.5-scaled one. We have derived the radiation temperature scaling law, in which the laser hohlraum coupling efficiency is included. With an appropriate coupling efficiency, the coincidences between experimental and scaling hohlraum radiation temperatures are rather good. ©2005 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

33644591904	A credible model describing radiation-driven implosion in cylindrical hohlraums	A one-dimensional model describing the radiation-driven implosion in cylindrical hohlraums is proposed in this article. For the model, the radiation flux boundary condition is composed of both the equilibrium and the nonequilibrium parts by means of the experimentally measured radiation temperature and the nonequilibrium x-ray spectra emitted from laser spots. The correctness of the model is guaranteed by a criterion, the capsule-absorbed radiation energy inferred from the hohlraum radiation theory, which is independent of any implosion simulation [Chang, Phys. Plasmas 11, 4286 (2004)]. In this article the model is applied to the implosion experiments performed at the Shenguang II laser facility [Zunqi, Chin. J.

As the absorption spectrums show, the main absorption peak in the visual region locates around 626 nm, and there is a linear relationship between the response of optical density and radiation time. The response increases with UV light energy density enhancing. The response to fractioned irradiation is a little stronger than that to continuous irradiation. The response keeps constant at temperature of 20-50°C and relative humidity 40%-60%. The sensitivity of the response is remarkably improved when halides are added into the radiochromic system. As the result of post-radiation effect, noteworthily, the response increases rapidly during the first 2 h after the irradiation and keeps stable later.

33947196268	Moire interferometry technique for short wavelength Rayleigh-Taylor instability	Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability plays a critical role in inertial confinement fusion as it causes the fuel-pusher mixing at the final stage of the implosion and may degrade the ignition and fusion burn performance. Under the most condition, the perturbation growth factor for l0 μm wavelength is the fastest and it requires that the spatial resolution of the diagnostic instruments is better than 5 μm. But it is almost impossible for the existing instruments. Using Moire interferometry to convert short wavelength perturbations to longer wavelength perturbations as the beat, a new technique was obtained. The technique for Moire interference was experimentally demonstrated on XG-II facility. Two transmission gratings whose periods (10 and 12 μm) are slightly different were used to image for X-ray source, and clear Moire interference images with 60 μm's period were acquired. The experimental results show that the technique of Moire interference is feasible.

33947213557	Characteristic parameters of diffusive supersonic radiation transport in low density materials	Diffusive heat waves play an important role in radiation hydrodynamics. In low density material, it may be possible that the radiative energy flux dominates the material energy flux and thus energy flow can be determined. In this paper by means of a simple algebraic method, the expressions characterizing the condition of diffusion approximation and supersonic transport of heat wave are found. In this case, the ratio of the radiative energy flux to the material energy flux is directly proportional to the product of Mach number M multiplied by optical depth τ. And it may also be expressed by radiation temperature heating material. The material density and length may be determined in order to achieve above-mentioned conditions when the driven temperature and duration are given. © 2007 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.

With a relative high frequency the discharge structures present different appearances of ring structures within different radii in time due to the evolvement of the filaments. The spontaneous electron density distributions help understanding the formation and development of self-organized discharge structures. During a cycle the electron avalanches are triggered by the electric field strengthened by the feeding voltage and the residual charged particles on the barrier surface deposited in the previous discharges. The accumulation of charges is shown to play a dominant role in the generation and annihilation of the discharge structures. Besides, the rings split and unify to bring and annihilate rings which form a new discharge structure. © 2011 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

An elongated current sheet (CS) was observed in the plasma between the two laser spots. In order to more closely model magnetotail reconnection, here two side-by-side thin target layers, instead of a single one, are used. It is found that at one end of the elongated CS a fanlike electron outflow region including three well-collimated electron jets appears. The (>1MeV) tail of the jet energy distribution exhibits a power-law scaling. The enhanced electron acceleration is attributed to the intense inductive electric field in the narrow electron dominated reconnection region, as well as additional acceleration as they are trapped inside the rapidly moving plasmoid formed in and ejected from the CS. The ejection also induces a secondary CS. © 2012 American Physical Society.

84867411002	Double-peak fusion rate of gas-filled target in laser fusion	The double-peak fusion rate of capsules for high yield implosion experiments on Shenguang III prototype laser is studied by numerical simulation. The competition of energy gain and loss in the fusion region causes the double-peak phenomenon in fusion rate. During the time of fusion, the ions in fusion region obtain energy mainly due to compression, and lose energy mainly by the Coulomb collision with electrons. The shock wave moves back and forth in the DT fuel because of the reflections in the center and at the inner surface of glass, which causes the fluctuation in compression power. The competition between the compression work and Coulomb collision fluctuates the internal energy of ions, resulting in the double-peak fusion rate. The simulations of bangtime are in good agreement with experiments.

84877147281	Soft x-ray low-pass filter with a square-pore microchannel plate	A type of low-pass filter devices for soft x rays is investigated by using a microchannel plate (MCP) of small channels with square cross section. The measured transmission spectra on the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility showed that the MCP has excellent bandpass effects below 1.5 keV by grazing incidence and internal multireflections. Combined with filters, the MCP energy bandwidth can be narrowed to 100 eV. In contrast to bandpass made of planar mirrors, the MCP has a much smaller size and better bandpass effects, and can be easily extended to high energy ranges. For low-resolution spectrometer applications of soft x rays, this method allows the monochromator to be replaced by a simple MCP filter and therefore significantly reduces alignment complexity in experiments. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

And then simulations of 18 laser beams overlapping are performed based on single laser beam focal spot profiles and laser pointing stability. Profiles and parameters of overlapped laser focal spot on target surface are given. Finally, the relations between imaging quality and laser pointing stability are studied under the requirements of isentropic compression experiments. Many conclusions are drawn from the study. The uniformity of focal spot can be raised by overlapping. What's more, better beam pointing stability is needed to keep the uniformity when the imaging quality is excellent. Otherwise, the outstanding imaging quality is wasteful. The beam pointing stability can just be within a certain range when imaging quality is common, for the uniformity cannot be improved much by better laser pointing stability.

84908227563	Novel free-form hohlraum shape design and optimization for laser-driven inertial confinement fusion	The hohlraum shape attracts considerable attention because there is no successful ignition method for laser-driven inertial confinement fusion at the National Ignition Facility. The available hohlraums are typically designed with simple conic curves, including ellipses, parabolas, arcs, or Lame curves, which allow only a few design parameters for the shape optimization, making it difficult to improve the performance, e.g., the energy coupling efficiency or radiation drive symmetry. A novel free-form hohlraum design and optimization approach based on the non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) model is proposed. In the present study, (1) all kinds of hohlraum shapes can be uniformly represented using NURBS, which is greatly beneficial for obtaining the optimal available hohlraum shapes, and (2) such free-form uniform representation enables us to obtain an optimal shape over a large design domain for the hohlraum with a more uniform radiation and higher drive temperature of the fuel capsule. Finally, a hohlraum is optimized and evaluated with respect to the drive temperature and symmetry at the Shenguang III laser facility in China. The drive temperature and symmetry results indicate that such a free-form representation is advantageous over available hohlraum shapes because it can substantially expand the shape design domain so as to obtain an optimal hohlraum with high performance.

Compared with the case of focusing irradiation, the laser absorption was effectively improved and the scattered light remarkably dropped under uniform irradiation; then due to the decrease in laser intensity, X-ray conversion increased. This is highly advantageous to the inertial confinement fusion. However, X-ray conversion mechanism basically did not change and X-ray conversion efficiency under beam smoothing and focusing irradiation was basically the same. © 2007 Science in China Press.

79953695626	A local rezoning and remapping method for unstructured mesh	This paper presents explicit description of the rezoning and remapping method for unstructured mesh. The rezoning and remapping constitute two of the three phases of Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods, while the other one is Lagrangian phase. Our method is local (vs. global) in order that the majority of mesh remains unchanged, and that the error caused by remapping can be confined within the changed areas. This is achieved by specifying the local worse areas of mesh based on the mesh-closure and mesh-union concepts. After the computing of worse areas, they are rezoned and united with the remaining areas to compose the new mesh. Then within the new mesh only the worse areas are remapped using four methods with different orders of accuracy, including linear interpolation, particle remapping, first order integral remapping and high order ENO (essentially non-oscillatory) remapping. (However, our program only uses the first order integral remapping method for the moment.) Our method's application in the inertial confinement fusion (ICF) simulation is introduced at the end. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84890854950	Analysis of time-dependent radiation symmetry in ICF based on self-similar solution	With the self-similar solution of X-ray confinement in cavity, the time-dependent redistribution of thermal X rays inside the hohlraum is calculated. Distribution of radiation power intensity on the capsule's surface is calculated via the view-factor method. After that, the time-dependent radiation drive symmetry of the capsule could be studied. The effects of motion of laser spots, laser pulses and pointing error of capsule on the radiation uniformity are analyzed. Multi parameter couples are scanned to reach the minimum of time-integrated value of the second coefficient of Legendre polynomials. The best lengths of hohlraum agree with the results of implosion symmetry tuning experiments on SG-II and SG-III prototype laser facilities. The best length-to-diameter ratio of hohlraum is close to the point design targets on the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The validated model may give some reference to the future experiments design and analysis of implosion symmetry.

84891329271	Table-top solar flares produced with laser driven magnetic reconnections	The American Nuclear Society (ANS) has presented the prestigious Edward Teller award to Dr. Bruce A. Remington during the 2011 IFSA conference due to his "pioneering scientific work in the fields of inertial confinement fusion (ICF), and especially developing an international effort in high energy density laboratory astrophysics" [1,2]. This is a great acknowledgement to the subject of high energy density laboratory astrophysics. In this context, we report here one experiment conducted to model solar flares in the laboratory with intense lasers [3]. The mega-gauss -scale magnetic fields produced by laser produced plasmas can be used to make magnetic reconnection topology. We have produced one table-top solar flare in our laboratory experiment with the same geometric setup as associated with solar flares. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2013.

84891672369	Investigation of radiation flux in certain band via the preheat of aluminum sample	Quantitative evaluation of the fractions of high energy x-rays in a hohlraum is crucial to the indirect driven-drive scheme of inertial confinement fusion and many other applications in high energy density physics. Preheat of a sample due to x-rays sensitively depends on optical thin photons. Analyzing the motion of a sample due to preheat can thus provide valuable information of those x-rays. In this article, we propose a method to infer the temporal evolution of the x-ray fluxes in the bands of our interest. By matching the simulation results to the motions of an aluminum sample, we can infer the time-resolved x-ray fluxes around the aluminum K-edge and the gold M-band inside the hohlraum. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

84896378488	The influence of laser clipped by the laser entrance hole on hohlraum radiation measurement on Shenguang-III prototype	Measuring the x-ray flux exiting the target's laser entrance hole (LEH) is the most common diagnostic that quantifies the x-ray intensity inside the laser-driven hohlraum. However, this signal accounts for only a small portion of the incident laser power and thus is likely to be affected by unwanted x-ray background from non-target area, leading to an overestimation of the hohlraum drive. Unwanted emission might be produced when the laser light is clipped by the LEH (LEH clipping) because of a lack of clearance for laser spot, or with a laser spot comprising of discrete structure, or even with a poor pointing accuracy. Its influence on the hohlraum radiation diagnostic is investigated on Shenguang-III prototype laser facility with the typical 1 ns square pulse. The experiment employed three types of targets to excite the unwanted x-ray background from LEH clipping, unconverted light, and both effects, respectively. This work gives an absolute evaluation of x-ray produced by the LEH clipping, which is measured by flat-response x-ray detectors (FXRD) at multiple view angles. The result indicates that there is little variation in measured emission to various view angles, because the unwanted x-rays are mainly generated at the side face of the LEH lip when laser is obliquely incident. Therefore, the LEH clipping brings more overestimation in hohlraum radiation measurement at larger view angle since the hohlraum LEH as an emitting source viewed by FXRD is decreased as the view angle increases. In our condition, the LEH clipping contributes 2%-3.5% overestimation to the hohlraum flux measurement. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

84896309038	Effect of X-ray wavelength, pinhole apertureand magnification on spatial resolution	X-ray pinhole imaging is an important diagnostic tool in inertial confinement fusion (ICF). The point spread function (PSF) of the X-ray pinhole imaging can be used to restore the initial image and estimate the spatial resolution. This paper analyzes relations among X-ray wavelength, size of pinhole aperture, magnification and also simplified Fresnel diffraction formula. The PSF of the X-ray pinhole imaging was derived numerically using Fresnel diffraction integral. Fresnel diffraction simulated the optimal pinhole aperture, X-ray wavelength and magnification with optimal spatial resolutions and an excellent signal-to-noise ratio. The calibration of the sample was used to gain the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the whole framing camera imaging system, and Fresnel diffraction simulated the PSF of the pinhole imaging, so the PSF of the framing camera was deduced. We also obtained the PSF of the framing camera by measuring its edge function, the two results were unanimous and showed the method to stimulate X-ray pinhole imaging by using Fresnel diffraction is feasible.

84899084979	Indirect-drive ablative Rayleigh-Taylor growth experiments on the Shenguang-II laser facility	In this research, a series of single-mode, indirect-drive, ablative Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability experiments performed on the Shenguang-II laser facility [X. T. He and W. Y. Zhang, Eur. Phys. J. D 44, 227 (2007)] using planar target is reported. The simulation results from the one-dimensional hydrocode for the planar foil trajectory experiment indicate that the energy flux at the hohlraum wall is obviously less than that at the laser entrance hole. Furthermore, the non-Planckian spectra of x-ray source can strikingly affect the dynamics of the foil flight and the perturbation growth. Clear images recorded by an x-ray framing camera for the RT growth initiated by small- and large-amplitude perturbations are obtained. The observed onset of harmonic generation and transition from linear to nonlinear growth regime is well predicted by two-dimensional hydrocode simulations. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

84899865196	The M-band transmission flux of the plastic foil with a coated layer of silicon or germanium	Silicon (Si) and Germanium (Ge) can be used as the dopant in the ablator material for the purpose of reducing preheating in indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion. Their performances in reducing preheating are quite different. A method to evaluate the difference of these two kinds of dopants has been presented in this letter. In the Shenguang-II high power laser facility, the M-band (1.6-4.4keV) transmission flux of Si-coated plastic (CH) and Ge-coated plastic (CH) has been measured by using the M-band x-ray diode. In the experiment, we find that the Si-coated CH can absorb more M-band x-rays and thus reduce the preheating of the fuel in our experiment condition. By using the radiation hydrodynamic code MULTI-1D, we got the simulation result which was well suited for the experiment. The comparison of their opacities (T

84899487195	Efficient multi-keV x-ray source generated by nanosecond laser pulse irradiated multi-layer thin foils target	A new target configuration is proposed to generate efficient multi-keV x-ray source using multiple thin foils as x-ray emitters. The target was constructed with several layers of thin foils, which were placed with a specific, optimized spacing. The thin foils are burned though one by one by a nanosecond-long laser pulse, which produced a very large, hot, underdense plasma. One-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations show that the emission region and the multi-keV x-ray flux generated by multi-layer thin foil target are similar to that of the low-density gas or foam target, which is currently a bright multi-keV x-ray source generated by laser heating. Detailed analysis of a range of foil thicknesses showed that a layer-thickness of 0.1-μm is thin enough to generate an efficient multi-keV x-ray source. Additionally, this type of target can be easily manufactured, compared with the complex techniques for fabrication of low-density foam targets. Our preliminary experimental results also verified that the size of multi-keV x-ray emission region could be enhanced significantly by using a multi-layer Ti thin foil target. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

84902956036	Deduction of temperature and density spatial profile for implosion core by multi-objective optimization	The spatial profiles of implosion core temperature and density are very important to check the theoretical simulation codes and understand the implosion physics in depth. A method is presented that the temperature and density profiles are evaluated by multi-objective optimization, where the normalized intensity profile is calculated from implosion core X-ray images. Two models, i.e., the model with considering absorption and the model without considering absorption, are studied. The results indicate that the temperature profile from the model without considering absorption is about twice that from the model with considering absorption. The density profiles evaluated by the two models are almost the same in the fuel zone, but the density from the model without considering absorption is more than ten times smaller than that from the model with considering absorption in the ablator zone. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society.

84916198096	Implosion dynamics measurements by monochromatic x-ray radiography in inertial confinement fusion	The implosion dynamics is the most important metrics for assessing the progress toward ignition of an inertially confined fusion experiment. A high spatial resolution monochromatic x-ray imaging system based on the spherically bent crystal is developed to measure the implosion trajectory. The density distribution of the imploding capsules can be inferred with more accurately from monochromatic trajectories. The self emission of the imploded core will be restrained by spectral resolution and the setup of the imaging system. Also the variations of the backlighters' intensity will not be seen in the images. It has been demonstrated on SGII laser facility at the first time. The ablator remaining mass and the implosion velocity, which are the important ablator parameters, are calculated from the monochromatic trajectories. And the results are contrasted to the 1D hydrodynamics simulations.

84916918541	Experimental investigation on the influence of the dopant ratio on ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability growth	Ablative Rayleigh-Taylor growth was measured with single-mode modulated planar CH foil with different ratio of Br dopant at Shenguang II laser facility. Results show that CH (6% Br) sample first enters the nonlinear regime and has the largest perturbation amplitude of second harmonic. The reason is that the density gradient effects can suppress the generation of the second harmonic, the more the Br is doped, the smaller the density gradient scale length can be achieved. The density gradient effects also suppress the feedback of third-order harmonic to the fundamental mode, which induces the nonlinear saturation amplitude to exceed 0.1λ, as the classical prediction shows.
