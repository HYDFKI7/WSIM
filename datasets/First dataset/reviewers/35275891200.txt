34347383743	Measurement of the top-quark mass using missing ET+jets events with secondary vertex b-tagging at CDF II	We present a measurement of the top-quark mass in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV which uses events with an inclusive signature of missing transverse energy and jets. The event selection is sensitive to tt̄→W+bW- b̄→lνbqq′b̄ independent of the lepton flavor and results in a large acceptance for W→τν decays. All-hadronic tt̄ decays and events with identified electrons or muons are vetoed to provide a statistically independent sample with respect to all previous measurements. The top-quark mass is inferred from the distribution of the scalar sum of all jet transverse energies and the missing transverse energy. Using 311pb-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab, we measure a top-quark mass mt=172.3-9.6+10.8(stat)±10.8(syst)GeV/c2. While the uncertainty on mt is larger than that of other measurements, the result is statistically uncorrelated with those of other methods and thus can help to reduce the overall mt uncertainty when combined with other existing measurements. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34547322861	First measurement of the ratio of central-electron to forward-electron W partial cross sections in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present a measurement of σ(pp̄→W)×B(W→eν) at s=1.96TeV, using electrons identified in the forward region (1.2<|η|<2.8) of the CDF II detector, in 223pb-1 of data. We measure σ×B=2796±13(stat)-90+95(syst)±162(lum)pb. Combining this result with a previous CDF measurement obtained using electrons in the central region (|η| 1), we present the first measurement of the ratio of central-electron to forward-electron W partial cross sections Rexp=0.925±0.006(stat)±0.032(syst), consistent with theoretical predictions using Coordinated Theoretical-Experimental Project on QCD (CTEQ) and Martin-Roberts-Stirling-Thorne (MRST) parton distribution functions. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34548753335	Search for heavy long-lived particles that decay to photons at CDF II	We present the first search for heavy, long-lived particles that decay to photons at a hadron collider. We use a sample of Î+jet+missing transverse energy events in pp collisions at s=1.96 TeV taken with the CDF II detector. Candidate events are selected based on the arrival time of the photon at the detector. Using an integrated luminosity of 570pb-1 of collision data, we observe 2 events, consistent with the background estimate of 1.3 0.7 events. While our search strategy does not rely on model-specific dynamics, we set cross section limits in a supersymmetric model with I E 10 GE and place the world-best 95% C.L. lower limit on the Ï‡Ëœ10 mass of 101 GeV/c2 at Ï.,Ï‡Ëœ10=5ns. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The analysis is performed using a data sample with an integrated luminosity of about 800pb-1 collected by the CDF II detector. For both vector mesons, we find that the polarizations become increasingly longitudinal as pT increases from 5 to 30GeV/c. These results are compared to the predictions of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics and other contemporary models. The effective polarizations of J/ψ and ψ(2S) mesons from B-hadron decays are also reported. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

35948994597	Precise measurement of the top-quark mass in the lepton+jets topology at CDF II	We present a measurement of the mass of the top quark from proton-antiproton collisions recorded at the CDF experiment in Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron. We analyze events from the single lepton plus jets final state (tt̄→W+bW-b̄→lνbqq̄′b̄). The top-quark mass is extracted using a direct calculation of the probability density that each event corresponds to the tt̄ final state. The probability is a function of both the mass of the top quark and the energy scale of the calorimeter jets, which is constrained in situ by the hadronic W boson mass. Using 167 events observed in 955pb-1 of integrated luminosity, we achieve the single most precise measurement of the top-quark mass, 170.8±2.2(stat.) ±1.4(syst.)GeV/c2. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

35448931078	Search for new particles leading to Z+jets final states in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present the results of a search for new particles that lead to a Z boson plus jets in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV using the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II). A data sample with a luminosity of 1.06fb-1 collected using Z boson decays to ee and μμ is used. We describe a completely data-based method to predict the dominant background from standard model Z+jet events. This method can be similarly applied to other analyses requiring background predictions in multijet environments, as shown when validating the method by predicting the background from W+jets in tt̄ production. No significant excess above the background prediction is observed, and a limit is set using a fourth generation quark model to quantify the acceptance. Assuming BR(b′→bZ)=100% and using a leading-order calculation of the b′ cross section, b′ quark masses below 268GeV/c2 are excluded at 95% confidence level. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We find the diphoton mass spectrum to be in agreement with the standard model expectation, and set limits on the cross section times branching ratio for the Randall-Sundrum graviton, as a function of diphoton mass. We subsequently derive lower limits for the graviton mass of 230GeV/c2 and 850GeV/c2, at the 95% confidence level, for coupling parameters (k/M̄Pl) of 0.01 and 0.1, respectively. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

No significant evidence of such a resonance is observed and we interpret the results to exclude the standard-model-like Z′ with a mass below 923GeV/c2 and the Randall-Sundrum graviton with a mass below 807GeV/c2 for k/M̄pl=0.1, both at the 95% confidence level.

35548967881	Searches for direct pair production of supersymmetric top and supersymmetric bottom quarks in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We search for direct pair production of supersymmetric top quarks and supersymmetric bottom quarks in proton-antiproton collisions at s=1.96TeV, using 295pb-1 of data recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II) experiment. The supersymmetric top (supersymmetric bottom) quarks are selected by reconstructing their decay into a charm (bottom) quark and a neutralino, which is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle. The signature of such processes is two energetic heavy-flavor jets and missing transverse energy. The number of events that pass our selection for each search process is consistent with the expected standard model background. By comparing our results to the theoretical production cross sections of the supersymmetric top and supersymmetric bottom quarks in the minimal supersymmetric standard model, we exclude, at a 95% confidence level in the frame of that model, a supersymmetric top quark mass up to 132GeV/c2 for a neutralino mass of 48GeV/c2, and a supersymmetric bottom quark mass up to 193GeV/c2 for a neutralino mass of 40GeV/c2. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We select events with six or more jets on which a number of kinematical requirements are imposed by means of a neural network algorithm. At least one of these jets must be identified as initiated by a b-quark candidate by the reconstruction of a secondary vertex. The cross section is measured to be σtt̄=8.3±1.0(stat)-1.5+2.0(syst) ±0.5(lumi)pb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction. The top quark mass of 174.0±2.2(stat)±4.8(syst)GeV/c2 is derived from a likelihood fit incorporating reconstructed mass distributions representative of signal and background. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The event signature requires two electromagnetic showers, each with transverse energy ET>5GeV and pseudorapidity |η|<1.0, with no other particles detected in the event. Three candidate events are observed. We discuss the consistency of the three events with γγ, π0π0, or ηη production. The probability that other processes fluctuate to 3 events is 1.7×10-4.

In this search one W decays to leptons, and the other boson (W or Z) decays hadronically. Combining with a previously published CDF measurement of Wγ boson production yields ATGC limits of -0.18<λ<0.17 and -0.46<Δκ<0.39 at the 95% confidence level, using a cutoff scale Λ=1.5TeV. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The search uses a data sample corresponding to approximately 1fb-1 of integrated luminosity. Events consistent with the W→ ν and H→bb̄ signature are selected by triggering on a high-pT electron or muon candidate and tagging one or two of the jet candidates as having originated from b quarks. A neural network filter rejects a fraction of tagged charm and light-flavor jets, increasing the b-jet purity in the sample. We observe no excess νbb̄ production beyond the background expectation, and we set 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction σ(pp̄→WH)Br(H→bb̄) ranging from 3.9 to 1.3 pb, for specific Higgs boson mass hypotheses in the range 110 to 150GeV/c2, respectively. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 320pb-1 collected with the CDF II detector. W bosons are identified in their electron decay channel and jets are reconstructed using a cone algorithm. For each W+≥n-jet sample (n=1-4) we measure the differential cross section dσ(pp̄→W+≥ n-jet)/dETnth-jet×B(W→eν) with respect to the transverse energy ET of the nth-highest ET jet above 20GeV, and the total cross section σ(pp̄→W+≥n-jet;ETnth-jet>25GeV)×B(W→eν), for a restricted W→eν decay phase space. The cross sections, corrected for all detector effects, can be directly compared to particle level W+jet(s) predictions.

The width is determined by normalizing predicted signal and background distributions to 230185 W candidates decaying to eν and μν in the transverse-mass region 50<MT<90GeV and then fitting the predicted shape to 6055 events in the high-MT region, 90<MT<200GeV.

The data were collected at the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II) and correspond to integrated luminosities between 0.7 and 1.0fb-1. We look for final states with one high-pT electron or muon, and two additional leptons. Our results are consistent with the standard model expectations, and we set limits on the cross section as a function of the chargino mass in three different supersymmetric scenarios.

For fully reconstructed candidate tt̄ events triggered on leptons with large transverse momentum and containing at least one identified b-quark jet, we compare the invariant mass spectrum of tt̄ pairs to the expected superposition of standard model tt̄, non-tt̄ backgrounds, and a simple resonance model based on a sequential Z′ boson. We establish upper limits for σ(pp̄→Z′) ·Br(Z′→tt̄) in the Z′ mass interval from 450GeV/c2 to 900GeV/c2. A topcolor leptophobic Z′ is ruled out below 720GeV/c2, and the cross section of any narrow Z′-like state decaying to tt̄ is found to be less than 0.64 pb at 95% C.L. for MZ′ above 700GeV/c2. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

41549095943	Observation of exclusive dijet production at the Fermilab Tevatron p̄p collider	We present the first observation and cross section measurement of exclusive dijet production in p̄p interactions, p̄p→p̄+dijet+p. Using a data sample of 310pb-1 collected by the Run II Collider Detector at Fermilab at s=1.96TeV, exclusive cross sections for events with two jets of transverse energy ETjet≥10GeV have been measured as a function of minimum ETjet. The exclusive signal is extracted from fits to data distributions based on Monte Carlo simulations of expected dijet signal and background shapes. The simulated background distribution shapes are checked in a study of a largely independent data sample of 200pb-1 of b-tagged jet events, where exclusive dijet production is expected to be suppressed by the Jz=0 total angular momentum selection rule. Results obtained are compared with theoretical expectations, and implications for exclusive Higgs boson production at the pp Large Hadron Collider at s=14TeV are discussed. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

Candidate events are classified as signal-like by three parallel analyses which use likelihood, matrix element, and neural network discriminants. These results are combined in order to improve the sensitivity. We observe a signal consistent with the standard model prediction, but inconsistent with the background-only model by 3.7 standard deviations with a median expected sensitivity of 4.9 standard deviations.

79952296234	Measurement of the B	The collection of a large number of B-hadron decays to hadronic final states at the CDF II Detector is possible due to the presence of a trigger that selects events based on track impact parameters. However, the nature of the selection requirements of the trigger introduces a large bias in the observed proper-decay-time distribution. A lifetime measurement must correct for this bias, and the conventional approach has been to use a Monte Carlo simulation. The leading sources of systematic uncertainty in the conventional approach are due to differences between the data and the Monte Carlo simulation. In this paper, we present an analytic method for bias correction without using simulation, thereby removing any uncertainty due to the differences between data and simulation. This method is presented in the form of a measurement of the lifetime of the B

42449091495	Measurement of ratios of fragmentation fractions for bottom hadrons in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	This paper describes the first measurement of b-quark fragmentation fractions into bottom hadrons in Run II of the Tevatron Collider at Fermilab. The result is based on a 360pb-1 sample of data collected with the CDF II detector in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV. Semileptonic decays of B̄0, B-, and B̄s0 mesons, as well as Λb0 baryons, are reconstructed. For an effective bottom hadron pT threshold of 7GeV/c, the fragmentation fractions are measured to be fu/fd=1.054±0.018(stat)-0.045+0.025(sys)±0. 058(B), fs/(fu+fd)=0.160±0.005(stat)-0.010+0.011(sys)-0.034+0.057(B), and fΛb/(fu+fd)=0.281±0.012(stat)-0.056+0.058(sys)-0.087+0.128(B), where the uncertainty B is due to uncertainties on measured branching ratios. The value of fs/(fu+fd) agrees within one standard deviation with previous CDF measurements and the world average of this quantity, which is dominated by LEP measurements. However, the ratio fΛb/(fu+fd) is approximately twice the value previously measured at LEP. The approximately 2σ discrepancy is examined in terms of kinematic differences between the two production environments. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

43949086894	Two-particle momentum correlations in jets produced in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present the first measurement of two-particle momentum correlations in jets produced in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV. Results are obtained for charged particles within a restricted cone with an opening angle of 0.5 radians around the jet axis and for events with dijet masses between 66 and 563GeV/c2. A comparison of the experimental data to theoretical predictions obtained for partons within the framework of resummed perturbative QCD in the next-to-leading log approximation shows that the parton momentum correlations survive the hadronization stage of jet fragmentation, giving further support to the hypothesis of local parton-hadron duality. The extracted value of the next-to-leading-log-approximation parton shower cutoff scale Qeff set equal to ΛQCD is found to be (1.4-0.7+0.9)×100MeV. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

We observe no significant excess over the expected background and thus set 95% confidence level upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross section for several Higgs boson masses ranging from 110 to 140GeV/c2. For a mass of 115GeV/c2, the observed (expected) limit is 20.4 (14.2) times the standard model prediction. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

In the combination of ′ ′ and νν channels, we observe an excess of events with a probability of 5.1×10-6 to be due to the expected background. This corresponds to a significance of 4.4 standard deviations.

A model-independent approach (Vista) considers the gross features of the data and is sensitive to new large cross section physics. A quasi-model-independent approach (Sleuth) searches for a significant excess of events with large summed transverse momentum and is particularly sensitive to new electroweak scale physics that appears predominantly in one final state. This global search for new physics in over 300 exclusive final states in 927pb-1 of pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV reveals no such significant indication of physics beyond the standard model. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

50449099562	Search for heavy, long-lived neutralinos that decay to photons at CDF II using photon timing	We present the results of the first hadron collider search for heavy, long-lived neutralinos that decay via χ10→γG in gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking models. Using an integrated luminosity of 570±34pb-1 of pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV, we select γ+jet+missing transverse energy candidate events based on the arrival time of a high-energy photon at the electromagnetic calorimeter as measured with a timing system that was recently installed on the CDF II detector. We find 2 events, consistent with the background estimate of 1.3±0.7 events. While our search strategy does not rely on model-specific dynamics, we set cross section limits and place the world-best 95% C.L. lower limit on the χ 10 mass of 101GeV/c2 at τχ 10=5ns. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

Two candidate events pass our final selection criteria, consistent with the standard model expectation.

The search employs data collected with the CDF II detector which correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 1fb-1. We select events consistent with a signature of a single lepton (e±/μ±), missing transverse energy, and two jets. Jets corresponding to bottom quarks are identified with a secondary vertex tagging method and a neural network filter technique. The observed number of events and the dijet mass distributions are consistent with the standard model background expectations, and we set 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio ranging from 3.9 to 1.3 pb for Higgs boson masses from 110 to 150GeV/c2, respectively. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

53349160646	Measurement of the inclusive jet cross section at the Fermilab Tevatron pp̄ collider using a cone-based jet algorithm	We present a measurement of the inclusive jet cross section in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV based on data collected by the CDF II detector with an integrated luminosity of 1.13fb-1. The measurement was made using the cone-based midpoint jet clustering algorithm in the rapidity region of |y|<2.1. The results are consistent with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD predictions based on recent parton distribution functions (PDFs), and are expected to provide increased precision in PDFs at high parton momentum fraction x. The results are also compared to the recent inclusive jet cross section measurement using the kT jet clustering algorithm, and we find that the ratio of the cross sections measured with the two algorithms is in agreement with theoretical expectations over a large range of jet transverse momentum and rapidity. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

For γ+E T and jet+E T candidate samples corresponding to 2.0 and 1.1fb-1 of integrated luminosity, respectively, we observe good agreement with standard model expectations and obtain a combined lower limit on the fundamental parameter of the large extra dimensions model MD as a function of the number of extra dimensions in the model. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

55149086109	Measurement of b-jet shapes in inclusive jet production in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present a measurement of the shapes of b-jets using 300pb-1 of data obtained with the upgraded Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II) in pp̄ collisions at center-of-mass energy s=1.96TeV. This measurement covers a wide transverse momentum range, from 52 to 300GeV/c. Samples of heavy-flavor enhanced jets together with inclusive jets are used to extract the average shapes of b-jets. The b-jets are expected to be broader than inclusive jets. Moreover, b-jets containing a single b-quark are expected to be narrower than those containing a bb̄ pair from gluon splitting. The measured b-jet shapes are found to be significantly broader than expected from the pythia and herwig Monte Carlo simulations. This effect may arise from an underestimation of the fraction of b-jets originating from gluon splitting in these simulations. The jet shape distributions provided in this paper could be compared to any full Monte Carlo simulation and could be used to further constrain the various parameters. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

This decay is strongly suppressed in the standard model and an observation of a signal at the Fermilab Tevatron would be an indication of physics beyond the standard model.

A model-independent approach (Vista) considers gross features of the data, and is sensitive to new large cross-section physics. Further sensitivity to new physics is provided by two additional algorithms: a Bump Hunter searches invariant mass distributions for "bumps" that could indicate resonant production of new particles, and the Sleuth procedure scans for data excesses at large summed transverse momentum.

These models have a distinctive signature of same-charge top-quark pairs and evade flavor-changing limits from meson mixing measurements. Data corresponding to 2fb-1 collected by the Collider Dectector at Fermilab II detector in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV are analyzed for evidence of the MxFV signature. For a neutral scalar η0 with mη0=200GeV/c2 and coupling ξ13=1, ∼11 signal events are expected over a background of 2.1±1.8 events. Three events are observed in the data, consistent with background expectations, and limits are set on the coupling ξ13 for mη0=180-300GeV/c2. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The largest excess over the standard model prediction is at an e+e- invariant mass of 240GeV/c2. The probability of observing such an excess arising from fluctuations in the standard model anywhere in the mass range of 150-1000GeV/c2 is 0.6% (equivalent to 2.5σ).

The study uses a CDF Run II data sample corresponding to 2fb-1 of integrated luminosity. The data are in good agreement with the standard model predictions, giving no evidence for any squark or gluino component. In an R-parity conserving minimal supergravity scenario with A0=0, μ<0, and tan β=5, 95 C.L. upper limits on the production cross sections in the range between 0.1 and 1 pb are obtained, depending on the squark and gluino masses considered. For gluino masses below 280GeV/c2, arbitrarily large squark masses are excluded at the 95 C.L., while for mass degenerate gluinos and squarks, masses below 392GeV/c2 are excluded at the 95 C.L. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

No significant excess above the standard model expectation is observed in the dimuon invariant-mass spectrum. We set 95% confidence level upper limits on σBR(pp̄→X→μμ̄), where X is a boson with spin-0, 1, or 2.

64349124232	Search for new physics in the μμ+e/μ+E T channel with a low-pT lepton threshold at the Collider Detector at Fermilab	A search for new physics using three-lepton (trilepton) data collected with the CDF II detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 976 pb-1 is presented. The standard model predicts a low rate of trilepton events, which makes some supersymmetric processes, such as chargino-neutralino production, measurable in this channel. The μμ+ signature is investigated, where ℓ is an electron or a muon, with the additional requirement of large missing transverse energy. In this analysis, the lepton transverse momenta with respect to the beam direction (pT) are as low as 5GeV/c, a selection that improves the sensitivity to particles that are light as well as to ones that result in leptonically decaying tau leptons. At the same time, this low-pT selection presents additional challenges due to the non-negligible heavy-quark background at low lepton momenta. This background is measured with an innovative technique using experimental data. Several dimuon and trilepton control regions are investigated, and good agreement between experimental results and standard-model predictions is observed. In the signal region, we observe one three-muon event and expect 0.4±0.1μμ+ events from standard-model processes. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

Z bosons are selected in the electron and muon decay modes. Jets are considered with transverse energy ET>20GeV and pseudorapidity |η|<1.5 and are identified as b jets using a secondary vertex algorithm. The ratio of the integrated Z+b jet cross section to the inclusive Z production cross section is measured to be 3.32±0.53(stat)±0.42(syst) ×10-3. This ratio is also measured differentially in jet ET, jet η, Z-boson transverse momentum, number of jets, and number of b jets.

Events are selected with a neural network which has been directly optimized for statistical precision in top-quark mass using neuroevolution, a technique modeled on biological evolution. The top-quark mass is extracted from per-event probability densities that are formed by the convolution of leading order matrix elements and detector resolution functions. The joint probability is the product of the probability densities from 344 candidate events in 2.0fb-1 of pp̄ collisions collected with the CDF II detector, yielding a measurement of Mt=171.2±2.7(stat)±2.9(syst)GeV/c2. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

This is the first measurement of the top quark mass using top-antitop pair candidate events in the lepton+jets and dilepton decay channels simultaneously. We reconstruct two observables in each channel and use a nonparametric kernel density estimation technique to derive two-dimensional probability density functions from simulated signal and background samples. The observables are the top quark mass and the invariant mass of two jets from the W decay in the lepton+jets channel, and the top quark mass and the scalar sum of transverse energy of the event in the dilepton channel. We perform a simultaneous fit for the top quark mass and the jet energy scale, which is constrained in situ by the hadronic W boson mass. Using 332 lepton+jets candidate events and 144 dilepton candidate events, we measure the top quark mass to be Mtop=171.9±1. 7(stat+JES)±1.1(othersyst)GeV/c2=171.9±2.0GeV/c2. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

We analyze a sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.9fb-1. We select events with an electron or muon, large missing transverse energy, and exactly four high-energy jets in the central region of the detector, at least one of which is tagged as coming from a b quark. We calculate a signal likelihood using a matrix element integration method, where the matrix element is modified by using effective propagators to take into account assumptions on event kinematics. Our event likelihood is a function of mt and a parameter JES (jet energy scale) that determines in situ the calibration of the jet energies. We use a neural network discriminant to distinguish signal from background events. We also apply a cut on the peak value of each event likelihood curve to reduce the contribution of background and badly reconstructed events. Using the 318 events that pass all selection criteria, we find mt=172.7±1.8(stat+JES) ±1.2(syst)GeV/c2. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

Results are obtained for charged particles in a cone of 0.5 radians around the jet axis in events with dijet invariant masses between 66 and 737GeV/c2. The experimental data are compared to theoretical predictions obtained for fragmentation partons within the framework of resummed perturbative QCD using the modified leading log and next-to-modified leading log approximations.

A sample of 328 events with a charged electron or muon and an isolated track, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.9fb-1, are selected as tt̄ candidates. To account for the unconstrained event kinematics, we scan over the phase space of the azimuthal angles (ν1,ν2) of neutrinos and reconstruct the top quark mass for each ν1, ν2 pair by minimizing a χ2 function in the tt̄ dilepton hypothesis. We assign χ2-dependent weights to the solutions in order to build a preferred mass for each event. Preferred mass distributions (templates) are built from simulated tt̄ and background events, and parametrized in order to provide continuous probability density functions.

66649107197	Search for exclusive Z-boson production and observation of high-mass pp̄→pγγp̄→pl+l-p̄ events in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	This Letter presents a search for exclusive Z boson production in proton-antiproton collisions at s=1.96TeV, using the CDFII detector. No exclusive Z→l+l- candidates are observed and the first upper limit on the exclusive Z cross section in hadron collisions is found to be σexcl(Z)<0.96pb at 95% confidence level. In addition, eight candidate exclusive dilepton events from the process pp̄→pγγp̄ →pl+l-p̄ are observed, and a measurement of the cross section for Mll>40GeV/c2 and |ηl|<4 is found to be σ=0.24-0.10+0.13pb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

66649121961	Search for gluino-mediated bottom squark production in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We report on a search for the supersymmetric partner of the bottom quark produced from gluino decays in data from 2.5fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab at s=1.96TeV. Candidate events are selected requiring two or more jets and large missing transverse energy. At least two of the jets are required to be tagged as originating from a b quark to enhance the sensitivity. The results are in good agreement with the prediction of the standard model processes, giving no evidence for gluino decay to bottom squarks. This result constrains the gluino-pair-production cross section to be less than 40 fb at 95% credibility level for a gluino mass of 350GeV/c2. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

66749099043	Top quark mass measurement in the tt̄ all hadronic channel using a matrix element technique in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present a measurement of the top quark mass in the all hadronic channel (tt̄→bb̄q1q̄2q3q̄4) using 943pb-1 of pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV collected at the CDF II detector at Fermilab (CDF). We apply the standard model production and decay matrix element (ME) to tt̄ candidate events. We calculate per-event probability densities according to the ME calculation and construct template models of signal and background. The scale of the jet energy is calibrated using additional templates formed with the invariant mass of pairs of jets. These templates form an overall likelihood function that depends on the top quark mass and on the jet energy scale (JES). We estimate both by maximizing this function. Given 72 observed events, we measure a top quark mass of 171.1±3.7(stat+JES)±2.1(syst)GeV/c2. The combined uncertainty on the top quark mass is 4.3GeV/c2. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

67649878769	Search for WW and WZ production in lepton plus jets final state at CDF	We present a search for WW and WZ production in final states that contain a charged lepton (electron or muon) and at least two jets, produced in s=1.96TeV pp̄ collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron, using data corresponding to 1.2fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected with the CDF II detector. Diboson production in this decay channel has yet to be observed at hadron colliders due to the large single W plus jets background. An artificial neural network has been developed to increase signal sensitivity, as compared with an event selection based on conventional cuts. We set a 95% confidence level upper limit of σWW×BR(W→ν,W→jets)+σWZ×BR(W→ ν ,Z→jets)<2.88pb, which is consistent with the standard model next-to-leading-order cross section calculation for this decay channel of 2.09±0.12pb. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

67649882013	Measurement of the tt̄ cross section in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV using dilepton events with a lepton plus track selection	This paper reports a measurement of the cross section for the pair production of top quarks in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron. The data were collected from the CDF run II detector in a set of runs with a total integrated luminosity of 1.1fb-1. The cross section is measured in the dilepton channel, the subset of tt̄ events in which both top quarks decay through t→Wb→ νb, where =e, μ, or τ. The lepton pair is reconstructed as one identified electron or muon and one isolated track. The use of an isolated track to identify the second lepton increases the tt̄ acceptance, particularly for the case in which one W decays as W→τν. The purity of the sample may be further improved at the cost of a reduction in the number of signal events, by requiring an identified b jet. We present the results of measurements performed with and without the request of an identified b jet. The former is the first published CDF result for which a b-jet requirement is added to the dilepton selection. In the CDF data there are 129 pretag lepton+track candidate events, of which 69 are tagged. With the tagging information, the sample is divided into tagged and untagged subsamples, and a combined cross section is calculated by maximizing a likelihood. The result is σtt̄=9.6±1.2(stat)-0.5+0.6(sys)±0.6(lum)pb, assuming a branching ratio of BR(W→ ν)=10.8% and a top mass of mt=175GeV/c2. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

67649889993	Measurement of particle production and inclusive differential cross sections in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We report a set of measurements of particle production in inelastic pp̄ collisions collected with a minimum-bias trigger at the Tevatron Collider with the CDF II experiment. The inclusive charged particle transverse momentum differential cross section is measured, with improved precision, over a range about ten times wider than in previous measurements. The former modeling of the spectrum appears to be incompatible with the high particle momenta observed. The dependence of the charged particle transverse momentum on the event particle multiplicity is analyzed to study the various components of hadron interactions. This is one of the observable variables most poorly reproduced by the available Monte Carlo generators. A first measurement of the event transverse energy sum differential cross section is also reported. A comparison with a pythia prediction at the hadron level is performed. The inclusive charged-particle differential production cross section is fairly well reproduced only in the transverse momentum range available from previous measurements. At higher momentum the agreement is poor. The transverse energy sum is poorly reproduced over the whole spectrum. The dependence of the charged particle transverse momentum on the particle multiplicity needs the introduction of more sophisticated particle production mechanisms, such as multiple parton interactions, in order to be better explained. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The search used time of flight to isolate slowly moving, high-pT particles. One event passed our selection cuts with an expected background of 1.9±0.2 events.

We reconstruct a candidate tb̄ mass in events with a lepton, neutrino candidate, and two or three jets, and search for anomalous tb̄ production as modeled by W′→tb̄. We set a new limit on a right-handed W′ with standard model-like coupling, excluding any mass below 800GeV/c2 at 95% C.L. The cross section for any narrow, resonant tb̄ production between 750 and 950GeV/c2 is found to be less than 0.28pb at 95% C.L.

The search uses data produced in proton-antiproton collisions at s=1.96TeV corresponding to 1.9fb-1 of integrated luminosity taken with the CDF detector. We find 28 áγbET events versus an expectation of 31.0-3.5+4.1 events. If we further require events to contain at least three jets and large total transverse energy, the largest SM source is radiative top-quark pair production, tt̄+γ. In the data we observe 16 tt̄γ candidate events versus an expectation from SM sources of 11.2-2.1+2.3. Assuming the difference between the observed number and the predicted non-top-quark total of 6.8-2.0+2.2 is due to SM top-quark production, we estimate the tt̄γ cross section to be 0.15±0.08pb. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

70349762854	Search for the neutral current top quark decay t→Zc using the ratio of Z-boson+4jets to W-boson+4jets production	We have used the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF-II) to search for the flavor-changing neutral-current (FCNC) top-quark decay t→Zc using a technique employing ratios of W and Z production, measured in pp̄ data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.52fb-1. The analysis uses a comparison of two decay chains, pp̄→tt̄→WbWb→νbjjb and pp̄→tt̄→ZcWb→cjjb, to cancel systematic uncertainties in acceptance, efficiency, and luminosity. We validate the modeling of acceptance and efficiency for lepton identification over the multiyear data set using another ratio of W and Z production, in this case the observed ratio of inclusive production of W to Z bosons. To improve the discrimination against standard model backgrounds to top-quark decays, we calculate the top-quark mass for each event with two leptons and four jets assuming it is a tt̄ event with one of the top quarks decaying to Zc. For additional background discrimination we require at least one jet to be identified as originating from a b quark. No significant signal is found and we set an upper limit on the FCNC branching ratio Br(t→Zc) using a likelihood constructed from the cjjb top-quark mass distribution and the number of νbjjb events. Limits are set as a function of the helicity of the Z boson produced in the FCNC decay. For 100% longitudinally-polarized Z bosons we find limits of 8.3% and 9.3% (95% C.L.) depending on the assumptions regarding the theoretical top-quark pair production cross section. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The possible existence of two nearby mass states is investigated. Within the limits of our experimental resolution the data are consistent with a single state, and having no evidence for two states we set upper limits on the mass difference between two hypothetical states for different assumed ratios of contributions to the observed peak. For equal contributions, the 95% confidence level upper limit on the mass difference is 3.6MeV/c2. Under the single-state model the X(3872) mass is measured to be 3871.61±0.16(stat)±0. 19(syst)MeV/c2, which is the most precise determination to date. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

79961040591	Search for a very light CP-Odd higgs boson in top quark decays from pp̄ collisions at √s=1.96TeV	We present the results of a search for a very light CP-odd Higgs boson a10 originating from top quark decays t→H⊃±b→W⊃± (⊃*)a10b, and subsequently decaying into τ⊃+τ⊃-. Using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.7fb⊃-1 collected by the CDF II detector in pp̄ collisions at 1.96TeV, we perform a search for events containing a lepton, three or more jets, and an additional isolated track with transverse momentum in the range 3 to 20GeV/c. Observed events are consistent with background sources, and 95% C.L. limits are set on the branching ratio of t→H⊃±b for various masses of H⊃± and a10. © 2011 American Physical Society.

79960792989	Measurement of event shapes in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	A study of event-shape observables in proton-antiproton collisions at √s=1.96TeV is presented. The data for this analysis were recorded by the CDF II Detector at the Tevatron Collider. The variables studied are the transverse thrust and thrust minor, both defined in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction. The observables are measured using energies from unclustered calorimeter cells. In addition to studies of the differential distributions, we present the dependence of event-shape mean values on the leading-jet transverse energy. Data are compared with pythia Tune A and to resummed parton-level predictions that were matched to fixed-order results at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy (NLO+NLL). Predictions from pythia Tune A agree fairly well with the data. However, the underlying event contributes significantly to these observables, making it difficult to make direct comparisons to the NLO+NLL predictions, which do not account for the underlying event. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a new observable, a weighted difference of the mean values of the thrust and thrust minor, which is less sensitive to the underlying event, allowing for a comparison with NLO+NLL. Both pythia Tune A and the NLO+NLL calculations agree well within the 20% theoretical uncertainty with the data for this observable, indicating that perturbative QCD successfully describes shapes of the hadronic final states. © 2011 American Physical Society.

79961158067	First search for multijet resonances in √s=1.96TeV pp̄ collisions	We present the first model independent search for three-jet hadronic resonances within multijet events in √s=1.96TeV pp̄ collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron using the CDF II detector. Pair production of supersymmetric gluinos and squarks with hadronic R-parity violating decays is employed as an example of a new physics benchmark for this signature. Selection criteria based on the kinematic properties of an ensemble of jet combinations within each event help to extract signal from copious QCD background. No significant excess outside the top quark mass window is observed in data with an integrated luminosity of 3.2fb⊃-1. We place 95% confidence level limits on the production cross section σ(pp̄→XX⊃′) ×BR(gg→3jet+3jet) where X, X⊃′=g, q, or q̄, with q, q̄→g+jet, as a function of gluino mass, in the range of 77GeV/c2 to 240GeV/c2. © 2011 American Physical Society.

80555148812	Measurement of the top-quark mass in the lepton+jets channel using a matrix element technique with the CDF II detector	A measurement of the top-quark mass is presented using Tevatron data from proton-antiproton collisions at center-of-mass energy √s=1.96TeV collected with the CDF II detector. Events are selected from a sample of candidates for production of tt̄ pairs that decay into the lepton+jets channel. The top-quark mass is measured with an unbinned maximum likelihood method where the event probability density functions are calculated using signal and background matrix elements, as well as a set of parametrized jet-to-parton transfer functions. The likelihood function is maximized with respect to the top-quark mass, the signal fraction in the sample, and a correction to the jet energy scale (JES) calibration of the calorimeter jets. The simultaneous measurement of the JES correction (Δ

84883186585	Improved determination of the sample composition of dimuon events produced in pp̄ collisions at √s=1.96 TeV	We use a new method to estimate with 5% accuracy the contribution of pion and kaon in-flight-decays to the dimuon data set acquired with the CDF detector. Based on this improved estimate, we show that the total number and the properties of the collected dimuon events are not yet accounted for by ordinary sources of dimuons which also include the contributions, as measured in the data, of heavy flavor, Υ{hooked}, and Drell-Yan production in addition to muons mimicked by hadronic punchthrough. The number of unaccounted events corresponds to (12.8±3.2)% of the bb̄ production. We find that (23±6)% of the unaccounted events contain additional muon candidates. For comparison, this fraction is (6.9±0.4)% for events due to bb̄ production. © 2011 The Author(s).
