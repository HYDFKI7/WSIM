9944223889	The application of Fourier transform infrared spectrometer to the smoke determination	The smoke of anti-infrared smoke agent in a self-made miniature smoke chamber was determined by using Forier transform infrared spectrometer. The smoke changing and settling regulation with time were obtained by measuring the IR spectra of smoke at different time dynamically. Through testing the smoke of different quantity of the same smoke agent, it was found that the relationship between the concentration of the main smoke products and the absorbance obeyed Lambert-Beer's Law. Finally, the relationship between the smoke screening ability and reactant agent amounts was obtained by calculating the screening ability of different amounts of reactant agent in three "atmosphere windows".

14344251636	Theoretical study of the dispersion effect of linear birefringence upon the sensitivity of an optical current sensor	The dispersion properties of linear birefringence and its effect upon the sensitivity of a bulk-glass optical current sensor are theoretically analyzed taking the Jones' Matrix as a mathematical tool and simulated with a computer. The peak wavelength of the optical source used in an optical current sensing system will be changed by the fluctuations of the driving current or its ambient temperature. This will result in the fluctuation of the sensitivity of the system because of the dispersion of the linear birefringence existing inside the sensing head. The investigation results show that the dispersion will affect the scale factor of the system. But the effect is so small that can be omitted. These results might be useful for the researchers and designers working in the optical current sensing techniques area.

To characterize the changes in the level of T helper 1 (Th1)- [interleukin (IL)-2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α] and Th2-type cytokine (IL-10) and the ratios of Th1/ Th2 (IL-2/IL-10 and TNF-α/IL-10) in placentae from women with preeclampsia and women with gestational hypertension. Methods. Placental levels of IL-2, TNF-α, and IL-10 were determined with radioimmunoassay and Th1/Th2 ratios (IL-2/IL-10 and TNF-α/IL-10) calculated in the placentae from 22 women with preeclampsia, 15 women with gestational hypertension, and 32 normal term pregnant women. Results. Although preeclampsia had the trend of the increase in the placental levels of IL-2 and TNF-α and the trend of the decrease in placental IL-10, there were not significant difference in placental levels of IL-2, IL-10, and TNF-α among preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and normal pregnancy (P > 0.05 for all). Placental ratios of IL-2/IL-10 and TNF-α/IL-10 were significantly higher in preeclampsia than in normal pregnancy (P = 0.035 and P = 0.005, respectively). No differences of Th1/Th2 ratios were found between preeclampsia and gestational hypertension and between gestational hypertension and normal pregnancy (P > 0.05 for all). Conclusions. Alterations of placental balances of cytokines with Th1 predominance were demonstrated in preeclampsia. These associations may offer insights into the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. © Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand 2005.

22944446092	Effect of the spectral width of optical sources upon the output of an optical current sensor	In bulk glass optical current sensing systems with polarization-preserving total reflection layers and wide spectral optical sources, the Verdet constant of the material of the sensing head, the linear birefringence inside the sensing element and the reflection-induced-retardance are all a function of the wavelength. Therefore, there will be error accumulation due to spectral width variation shown in the output of the systems, which has scarcely been discussed before. In this paper, the dispersion formulae of the Verdet constant, reflection-induced-retardance and linear birefringence inside a current sensing cell made of ZF-7 glass are given, then their error accumulation due to spectral width variation upon the output of the system is theoretically analysed and digitally simulated. Finally, the effect of the spectral width of the optical source upon the output of the system is simulated and analysed. The result shows that the effect of the spectral width variation of optical sources on the output of the system is less than 0.025%; the effect of the Verdet constant is dominant in the joint effect, and the system output increases with increasing source spectral width, which is confirmed qualitatively by an experiment. Therefore, the treatment using a monochromatic model to describe systems with a broad-band optical source is adequate. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.

0012779063	Polarization-preserving totally reflecting prisms with a single medium layer	When reflectors with layers are used at non-normal incidence, the two planes of polarization generally have different phase shifts. The difference in the shifts is known as phase retardance. For prisms with a single layer, this retardance depends on four factors: prism index, layer index, the ratio of the optical thickness of the layer to the wavelength, and angle of incidence. When the retardance is kept at zero and the reflectance for both p and s components of a polarized light are controlled at almost 100% after reflection, a polarization-preserving total reflection is realized. Polarization-preserving totally reflecting prisms (PPTRP's) have many applications in scientific research and optical engineering. Designers of the PPTRP's need references concerning the phase properties of the PPTRP's. However, few papers can be found in which the effects of the four factors on the retardance of the PPTRP's were investigated and compared thoroughly, although the theory concerned has been known and the influences from some (not all) factors have been reported. Therefore it is still necessary to study the behavior of the PPTRPs from all aspects. The effects of all four factors on the retardance are analyzed and compared from all aspects. A general method of designing PPTRPs is proposed. As an example, a special PPTRP is designed and both theoretical and experiment results are given. © 1997 Optical Society of America.

The all optic-fiber OCS has the advantage of a simple structure, however the effects of the birefringence inside the fiber is a main problem. The birefringence in the bulk-optic material OCS's sensing head is less than that inside the optic-fiber sensing head, however, the problem of reflection-induced phase retardances is presented.

The results show that when the circumstance temperature changed in the range of -40°C-40°C, the temperature distributions in the sensing head changed about 80°C. While the temperature gradient inside the head was not significantly varied, the biggest temperature gradient was only about 3°C; the temperature distributions on the optical sensing path would also change about 80°C. Similarly, the temperature gradient on the path was not significantly varied, at most 2°C.

However, they exhibit little absorption in the photodynamic window (600-900 nm) and are not water soluble, which limits their application in photodynamic therapy. Sulfonated and metal-ioned hypocrellins have been designed and synthesized to improve their water solubility. Unfortunately, the water-soluble derivatives obtained exhibit lower photodynamic activity than the parent hypocrellins. Thiolated and animated hypocrellins have also been designed and synthesized to enlarge their photoresponse. Among them, the animated hypocrellins possess the highest photodynamic activity. We recently have further designed and synthesized some amphiphilic animated hypocrellin derivatives. Thus, not only the photoresponse but also the water solubility is enhanced.

Existence and changes of out magnetic field cause bias angle of Faraday mirror deviating initial value and output light of system degenerating into elliptical polarization light from ideal linear polarization light. It brings about the decline of sensitivity and stability of FMOCT. At the same time, solving the influence of out magnetic field by electromagnetic shield is proposed.

33751510896	The wavelength accumulation effect of Verdet constant upon an optical current sensor	Verdet constant is one of the prominent parameter showing the magneto-optical property of magneto-optical materials. There will be a wavelength accumulation effect in the systems employing broad-band optical sources, because of the dispersion property of Verdet constant. It is not proved, however, how much this effect can affect the broad-band system up till now. Therefore it is necessary to research into it, because the question whether it is reasonable and feasible to use a monochromatic light model for the describing of broad-band systems is concerned. The dispersion formula of the Verdet constant of ZF-7 glass is calculated first, and then, its wavelength accumulation effect upon an optical current sensor is theoretically analyzed and digitally simulated, in this paper. The results show that the wavelength accumulation effect of the Verdet constant of ZF-7 glass is less enough and the treatment of using monochromatic model to describe broad-band optical current sensing systems is reasonable and feasible, if the wavelength accumulation effects of the other optical parameters of the sensing head are not considered. The results might be a reference to the colleagues working in the optical current sensing techniques area. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33750914100	Theoretical analysis of reciprocity problems in bulk glass optical current sensors	Aiming to the idea of that 'the Faraday effect will be doubled and the linear birefringence will be eliminated by using a return-back optical path', the equivalent matrices of Orthoconjugate Reflection (OCR)-typed, Direct Reflection (DR)-typed, and Roof-prism Reflection (RPR)-typed optical current sensor models are derived, respectively. The results show that the OCR-typed return-back optical path can eliminate the effects of the linear birefringence, while the DR-typed and the RPR-typed return-back optical paths can not do that when the Faraday rotation is zero; all of these three return-back optical paths can not eliminate the effects of the linear birefringence when the Faraday rotation is not zero. Therefore, it is worthy to discuss that whether the view of 'the Faraday effect will be doubled and the linear birefringence will be eliminated by using a return-back optical path' is correct for the bulk glass optical current sensor employing the conventional '-/+' signal processing scheme.

33845738886	Theoretical analysis of optical source spectral width on output of optical current sensor via Verdet constant dispersion	Verdet constant is a prominent parameter showing the property of magneto-optical glasses. Because it is the function of wavelength, it has dispersion features. Therefore, when broadband optical sources are used in optical current sensing systems, the Verdet constant will have a different value when the sensors work at a different wavelength. To overcome this situation, the value of the magneto-optic coefficient in the dispersion formula of Verdet constant of ZF-7 glass was calculated first, and then the effects of optical source spectrum width upon an optical current sensor via Verdet constant dispersion were theoretically analyzed and digitally simulated. The results show that the effect of the spectrum width on the output of an OCS is less than 0.01% in the wavelength range within 60 nm. Therefore, the treatment of using monochromatic model to describe broadband systems is reasonable and feasible, if the other optical parameters dispersion of the sensing head are not considered. The results provide a possible reference for further research in the optical current sensing techniques area.

33846391563	Influence of reflection-induced-retardance of non-polarizing beam splitter upon the polarization state of the output light of faraday mirror optical current transformer	Elliptical degeneration of output light of optical current transformer is caused by linear birefringence and refection-induced retardance, which results in reduction of sensitivity. Faraday mirror-typed optical current transformer (FMOCT) can effectively solve this problem. Non-polarizing beam splitter (NPBS) is the core apparatus in this project. In order to exactly master the capability and function of NPBS, matrix model of NPBS and Faraday mirror-typed optical current transformer is built by Jones matrix. The influence of reflection-induced-retardance of NPBS upon the polarization state of the output light of FMOCT is analyzed. Then the project of measuring the value of reflection-induced-retardance of NPBS whose actual value is 5.02° under normal temperature is proposed and experimental temperature curve is drawn. The curve of polarization state of output light of system is simulated by the software MathCAD and the relation between elliptical ratio and reflection-induced-retardance is analyzed. Drift range of reflection-induced-retardance which is 0.2 grade allowed in metering level of optical current transformer is less than 0.1%. The result might have reference on the practical application investigation of FMOCT.

33847781724	Antioxidant attenuates acute lung injury after cardiopulmonary bypass in rats	This study tested the effects of the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate on acute lung injury induced by cardiopulmonary bypass in rats. Adult rats were randomly divided into 3 groups of 7 each. The study group was pretreated with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate before undergoing 60 min of normothermic partial cardiopulmonary bypass, a control group underwent cardiopulmonary bypass only, and a third group underwent a sham operation involving anesthesia and cannulation only. The respiratory index at 60 min after terminating bypass was significantly increased in the study group only. Neutrophil, malondialdehyde, interleukin-8, nuclear factor-κB, and protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the cardiopulmonary bypass group were significantly higher than those in the other two groups, with marked inflammatory changes on lung histopathology. It was concluded that cardiopulmonary bypass can directly induce acute lung injury, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate attenuates this injury by inhibiting nuclear factor-κB activity.

33947180344	Elevated serum levels of interleukin-15 and interleukin-16 in preeclampsia	A generalized inflammatory response has been considered to be the main pathology and has an important role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. The immune aberrations per se and immunomodulatory milieu present in serum need to be elucidated. The purpose of the current investigation was to characterize changes in serum levels of interleukin (IL)-15 and IL-16 in preeclampsia. Thirty-seven women with preeclampsia were recruited and 36 age- and gestational age-matched women with normal pregnancy served as control. Levels of IL-15 and IL-16 were detected with immune assays in all serum samples. We found that serum levels of IL-15 and IL-16 were significantly higher in preeclampsia than in normal pregnancy (p < 0.001 for both). There were significant differences in serum IL-15 and IL-16 between mild and severe preeclampsia (p < 0.01 for both). Our data corroborate the hypothesis of an increased inflammatory response in preeclampsia, as illustrated by the elevated serum levels of IL-15 and IL-16, suggesting their possible role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. These associations may offer insight into the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

33847382274	Changes of serum cardiotropin I and cystatin C in preeclampsia and significance thereof	Objective: To investigate the changes and of serum cardiotropin I (cTN I) and cystatin C in preeclampsia clinical significance thereof. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 40 women with preeclampsia, aged 29 (18-39), with the medium gestational age of 35 weeks, and 40 age- and gestational age-matched controls. Serum cTN I and cystatin C were determined with ELISA and serum levels of creatinin kinase, creatinine, and uric acid were assayed by automatic biochemical analyzer. Comparison was made between the 2 groups. Results: The serum cTn I of the preclampsia group was 0.59 μg/L ± 0.42 μg/L, significantly higher than that of the control group (0.09 μg/L ± 0.22 μg/L P < 0.001), and the serum cystatin C of the preclampsia group was 1.64 mg/L ± 0.47 mg/L, significantly higher than that of the control group (1.08 mg/L ± 0.19 mg/L, P < 0.001). And the serum cardiotropin I and cystatin C concentrations of the patients with severe preeclampsia were 0.66 μg /L ± 0.40 μg/L and 1.72 mg/L ± 0.46 mg/L respectively, both significantly higher than those of the patients with mild preclampsia (0.17 μg/L ± 0.26 μg/L and 1.21 mg/L ± 0.37 mg/L respectively, P < 0.001 and 0.05 respectively). Conclusion: Serum cTn I and cystatin C levels are elevated in preeclampsia and the elevation is associated with the severity of preeclampsia, suggesting that serum concentrations of cTn I and cystatin C are useful markers in the early diagnosis of cardiac and renal injury in patients of preeclampsia.

UV spectrum revealed that absorption band of apo-azurin at 628 nm disappeared , while the fluorescence spectrum of holo-azurin and apo-azurin had no difference and only minor changes of circular dichroism spectrum for apo-azurin were observed. Biological activities of azurin on p53 positive Acc2 and Acc3 Chinese oral cancer cell lines were also investigated with MTT assay and flow cytometer. The results indicated that azurin could inhibit the cancer cell proliferation and enhance cell's apoptosis. Although the copper atom was not necessary for azurin to perform its cytotoxicity and apoptosis activity in the cancer cell lines, the pharmacological activity of apo-azurin on apoptosis was found to decrease compared to the holo-azurin.

34648828433	Simulations of electromagnetic wave-absorbing properties of structures consisting of left-handed and right-handed materials	To review the effect of left-handed materials in the structural design of an electromagnetic wave absorber, a wave-absorber model with a structure of air/left-handed-medium/right-handed-medium/metal was proposed. Wave-absorption properties of the structure were theoretically analyzed using the transmission line model. Then structural parameters were optimized through genetic algorithms and numerical simulations were made. The results showed that, when the wave was normally incident and the structural electromagnetic parameters were well matched, an average reflectance of-12 dB could be achieved within the frequency range from 0.4 to 10 GHz. This means that the usage of left-handed materials allows better matching of electromagnetic parameters, increased peak values pf absorption, and the broadening of the bandwidth of absorption. Research in this paper offers a new idea for the development of wave-absorbers with broad bandwidth.

39149112525	New designs and characteristics analysis of non-polarizing beam splitters	When used at oblique angles of incidence, the reflectance and transmittance of thin films exhibit strong polarization effects, particularly for the films inside a glass cube, which results from the fact that the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields are continuous across each layer interface. However, for many applications, the polarization effects are undesirable and should be reduced. In the present paper, a method for designing a non-polarizing beam splitter (NPBS) in a cube is introduced, based on the Brewster condition. Applied examples of the NPBSs designed employing this method are also researched within specified wavelength ranges. Moreover, the effects of some important parameters, including the incident angle and the material indices, on the NPBS are investigated.

In an optical current sensing system, when the fluctuations of the driving current or the ambient temperature of the optical source occurs, the peak wavelength of the source would change.

The transmission spectrum, as a function of the incident angle and the frequency, is simulated using computing. The results indicate that this photonic crystal has a wider reflect band which is insensitive to the incident angle when the thickness is not much modulated by the "chirped" function. The reason is that the real part of the complete effective index is almost zero, but the imaginary part is more lager. This special property could be used to make high quality reflection lens with wide band and full incident angle.

It is found that the Goos-Hänchen shift of the reflected wave in partial reflection is identical to that of the transmitted one. The Goos-Hänchen shift of the transmitted wave oscillates as the thickness of the film increases, tending to increase gradually. The Goos-Hänchen shift of the transmitted wave reaches its absolute maximum when the transmitted wave resonance. The Goos-Hänchen shift of the transmitted wave is significantly influenced by the incident angle and the angle between the optical axis and the interface.

45449103308	Electromagnetic characteristics of uniaxially anisotropic left-handed material	Left-handed materials are a recent development. This paper studies some electromagnetic characteristics of uniaxially anisotropic left-handed materials according to the Maxwell equation. It gives theoretical calculations in which the optical axis was inclined with respect to the interface of the material. Dispersion equations for E-polarized plane waves and H-polarized plane waves were derived. Refraction and total reflection were analyzed for the condition in which electromagnetic waves were incident from isotropic right-handed materials into uniaxially anisotropic left-handed materials, so that conditions of negative refraction and anomalous total reflection were obtained. The amplitude reflection coefficient and amplitude transmission coefficient were derived when evanescent waves passed through a slab of left-handed material. It was found that the transmissivity of evanescent waves is exponentially amplified as the thickness of the slab increases under certain special conditions. Finally, the polarized beam-splitting property of this material was examined, leading to a better understanding of conditions for polarized beam splitting.

The characteristic equations of the guided modes in this waveguide were derived. The fast and slow wave characteristics of the guided modes were investigated. It was found that the non-surface wave modes of the uniaxially anisotropic left-handed material slab waveguide are different from that of the right- or left-handed waveguide. These modes can be either fast wave mode or slow wave mode; there is a cut-off frequency for the non-surface wave even modes; and the surface wave modes are all slow wave modes. The conditions that the characteristic equation of the surface wave has a solution was also explored. The relationship between the electromagnetic parameters of the waveguide and the solution of the characteristic equation of the surface wave modes was discussed. It was found that the surface waves with the same frequency sometimes can have two modes. The orthogonality of guided modes was proven.

54549125750	Design and characteristics analysis of non-polarizing beam splitters	A method has been developed for a non-polarizing beam splitter which utilizes a Brewster condition in a cube that eliminates polarization effects caused by the oblique incidence of light. This design concept was based on the use of quarter-wave layers of three conventional materials which were paired to have the same effective indices of p polarization. In this way they produce identical reflectance of two polarizations at a specified wavelength. Performance outside this wavelength was improved by altering the order of layers. Analysis of characteristics at various angles for non-polarizing beam splitters with birefringent properties was also conducted. Three designs with 30%, 50% and 70% reflectance were achieved with polarization separation less than 5% in the 2° region.

5644229776	Method for measuring linear birefringence inside bulk glass current-sensing elements	Linear birefringence is one of the most important parameters of optical (fibre-optic) current-sensing heads, which can obviously affect the performance of optical current sensors. Therefore, it is of great importance to measure the linear birefringence inside the optical current-sensing head to enhance the properties of sensors. A novel method to measure the linear birefringence inside bulk glass current-sensing heads is reported in this paper, which gives a theoretical analysis of the principle, the measurement uncertainty analysis - using the Jones matrix as a mathematical tool - and an applied example. This method overcomes the shortcomings of the two methods reported before which cannot uniquely determine the value of the linear birefringence or introduce large measurement uncertainty. The experimental result shows that this method can certainly enhance the measurement precision. © 2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.

57649091702	Theoretical analysis of the temperature characteristics of an optical current sensing element	The temperature characteristics of an optical current sensing element are theoretically analyzed. The investigation results show that all following factors such as the peak wavelength shift induced by the ambient temperature variation of the optical source used, the Verdet constant variation with the temperature of the sensing material and the linear birefringence change with the changes of the temperature and stress inside the sensing head can exert harmful effect upon the output scale factor of the system and let the sensing cell show some temperature characteristics. The results also show that the effects of the first factor are greater than the others, and their varying trends are opposite and offset each other a little. As temperature changes from 283 K to 303 K, the scale factor changes 1.379%, which is greater than the national standard of 0.2%. These results indicate that proper measures have to be taken to stabilize the temperatures of both the optical source and the sensing head in the design of optical current transformers. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

59649118985	Method of reducing the initial linear birefringence effect of passive OCT	The performance of passive Optical Current Transformer (OCT) with the linear birefringence is analyzed based on Jones matrix. The results show that passive OCT still works when the output light is circularly polarized, and the output voltage of passive OCT is affected by linear birefringence even though the output light is linearly polarized. The performance of passive OCT is analyzed when the Polarization angle and phase shift of the incident light and the different initial birefringence are introduced. The results show that when the initial birefringence exists, the relative deviation of system output has minimum. The corresponding incident light phase shift to minimum monotonically increases with the initial birefringence. A method of reducing the influence of passive OCT initial linear birefringence is proposed based on increasing the phase shift of incident light. The numerical and experimental results prove its feasibility. Developed practical optical current transformer has reference significance to improve the performance of passive OCT.

The etiology of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), a pregnancy-specific complication, remains not completely understood. Some alterations of immunity in ICP were reported, but the profile of immune alteration was far from clarified. The aim of this investigation was to characterize the changes of serum levels of neopterin, a marker for the activation of macrophage, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), a marker for the activation of lymphocyte, in ICP. Methods. Serum levels of neopterin and sIL-2R were assayed with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 30 patients with ICP and 30 normal pregnant women. Student's t-test was used for statistic analysis, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results.

We also calculated the dependencies of the real part and imaginary part of the effective permeability of the structure on varying external magnetic field strengths and different frequencies. The results showed that the characteristic magnetic field strength for switching of the structural property was proportional to the difference between the external field frequency and the linear eigen-frequency of the metamaterial. In the nonlinear regime the magnetic response of the metamaterial may become bistable. This phenomenon may be used to create optically bistable behavior, and hence optical switching devices, although as yet this has only been demonstrated at microwave frequencies.

0242268557	Synthesis and Characterization of Three Novel Amphiphilic Aminated Hypocrellins as Photodynamic Therapeutic Agents	To improve the amphiphilicities and red absorption of the hypocrellins, three novel 2-amino-2-demethoxy-hypocrellins were synthesized by the mild reactions of hypocrellin B with 4-(2-amino-ethyl)morpholine, N,N-dimethylethylenediamine and 1-(2-amino-ethyl)piperazine, respectively. The structures of these derivatives were characterized with proton nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and mass spectra (MS). The ultraviolet-visible absorption and fluorescence spectra of the derivatives were measured and the new amino-substituted hypocrellins showed strong absorption in the domain of the phototherapeutic window (600-900 nm). Their amphiphilicities evaluated via the partition coefficients between n-octanol and phosphate-buffered saline buffer improved remarkably. Electron paramagnetic resonance spin-trapping measurements were used to investigate the photodynamic action of the three compounds in the presence of oxygen. Singlet oxygen (

0346093872	Effects of the polarizer parameters upon the performance of an optical current sensor	Extinction ratio is an important parameter of a polarizer, and the bias angle of the polarizer used in optical current sensing systems is also an important adjustable parameter. Both of them can certainly affect the performance of the sensing systems. In this paper, the effects of the extinction ratio and bias angle error of polarizers upon the output characteristics of an optical current sensor are investigated theoretically and experimentally; some useful results are given for the optical current sensor researchers and designers. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

11144247738	Alterations of serum resistin in normal pregnancy and pre-eclampsia	Resistin is expressed in human placenta and has been postulated to play a role in regulating energy metabolism in pregnancy. However, changes in serum resistin levels in normal pregnancy and in the setting of pre-eclampsia are far from understood. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the alterations in serum resistin level in normal pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. Blood samples were taken from 28 healthy non-pregnant women, 27 women in the first, 26 in the second and 26 in the third trimesters of normal pregnancy and 25 women with pre-eclampsia. Serum resistin concentrations were determined by using an ELISA, and mean serum resistin levels were compared with one-way ANOVA. Serum resistin levels were not significantly different among non-pregnant women and women in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy (P > 0.05 for all). Serum resistin was significantly elevated in the third trimester of normal pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women (P < 0.01) and women in the first (P < 0.001) and second (P < 0.001) trimesters of pregnancy. Serum resistin level was significantly lower in women with pre-eclampsia than women in the third trimester of normal pregnancy (P < 0.001), but was comparable with those of non-pregnant women and women in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy (P > 0.05 for all). In conclusion, we found an increase in serum resistin in the third trimester of normal pregnancy, but this increase was not present in pre-eclampsia. We postulate that these associations may offer insight into the mechanisms of maternal adaptation to pregnancy and the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.
