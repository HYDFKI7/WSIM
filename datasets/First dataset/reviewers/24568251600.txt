We determine the mass to be M<inf>X(3872)</inf>=(3871.85±0.27(stat)±0.19(syst))MeV, a 90% confidence level upper limit on the natural width of Γ <inf>X(3872)</inf><1.2MeV, the product branching fraction B(B <sup>+</sup>→K<sup>+</sup>X(3872))×B(X(3872)→π <sup>+</sup>π<sup>-</sup>J/ψ)=(8.63±0.82(stat)±0.52(syst)) ×10<sup>-</sup>6, and a ratio of branching fractions B(B0→K0X(3872))/ B(B<sup>+</sup>→K<sup>+</sup>X(3872))=0.50±0.14(stat)±0. 04(syst).

30044445538	Results of the first performance tests of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter	Performance tests of some aspects of the CMS ECAL were carried out on modules of the "barrel" sub-system in 2002 and 2003. A brief test with high energy electron beams was made in late 2003 to validate prototypes of the new Very Front End electronics. The final versions of the monitoring and cooling systems, and of the high and low voltage regulation were used in these tests. The results are consistent with the performance targets including those for noise and overall energy resolution, required to fulfil the physics programme of CMS at the LHC.

33645799703	Improved constraints on D0-D̄0 mixing in D0→K+π- Decays from the Belle detector	We report the results of a search for D0-D̄0 mixing in D0→K+π- decays based on 400fb-1 of data accumulated by the Belle detector at KEKB. Both assuming CP conservation and allowing for CP violation, we fit the decay-time distribution for the mixing parameters x′ and y′, as well as for the parameter RD, the ratio of doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decays to Cabibbo-favored decays. The 95% confidence level region in the (x′2,y′) plane is obtained using a frequentist method. Assuming CP conservation, we find x′2<0.72×10-3 and -9.9×10-3<y′<6.8×10-3 at the 95% confidence level; these are the most stringent constraints on the mixing parameters to date. The no-mixing point (0,0) has a confidence level of 3.9%. Assuming no mixing, we measure RD=(0.377±0.008±0.005)%. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Using fully reconstructed D(*)π events and partially reconstructed D*π events from a data sample that contains 386×106 BB̄ pairs that was collected near the Υ(4S) resonance, with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy e+e- collider, we obtain the CP violation parameters S+(D(*)π) and S-(D(*)π). We obtain S+(D*π)=0.049±0.020(stat)±0.011(sys), S-(D*π)=0.031±0.019(stat)±0.011(sys), and S+(Dπ)=0.031±0.030(stat)±0.012(sys), S-(Dπ)=0.068±0. 029(stat)±0.012(sys). These results are an indication of CP violation in B0→D*-π+ and B0→D-π+ decays at the 2.5σ and 2.2σ levels, respectively. If we use the values of RD(*)π that are derived using assumptions of factorization and SU(3) symmetry, branching fraction measurements for the B→Ds(*)π modes, and lattice QCD calculations, we can restrict the allowed region of |sin (2 1+ 3)| to be above 0.44 and 0.52 at 68% confidence level from the D*π and Dπ modes, respectively. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33745551373	Measurement of 3 with a Dalitz plot analysis of B+→D(*) K(*)+ decay	We present a measurement of the unitarity triangle angle 3 using a Dalitz plot analysis of the KS0π+π- decay of the neutral D meson from the B±→D(*)K(*)± process. The method exploits the interference between D0 and D̄0 to extract the angle 3, strong phase δ and the ratio r of suppressed and allowed amplitudes. We apply this method to a 357fb-1 data sample collected by the Belle experiment. The analysis uses three modes: B+→DK+, B+→D*K+ with D*→Dπ0, and B+→DK*+ with K*+→KS0π+, as well as the corresponding charge-conjugate modes. From a combined maximum likelihood fit to the three modes, we obtain 3=53°+15°-18°(stat)±3°(syst) ±9°(model).

34247343357	Energy resolution of the barrel of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter	The energy resolution of the barrel part of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter has been studied using electrons of 20 to 250 GeV in a test beam. The incident electron's energy was reconstructed by summing the energy measured in arrays of 3×3 or 5×5 channels. There was no significant amount of correlated noise observed within these arrays. For electrons incident at the centre of the studied 3×3 arrays of crystals, the mean stochastic term was measured to be 2.8% and the mean constant term to be 0.3%. The amount of the incident electrons' energy which is contained within the array depends on its position of incidence. The variation of the containment with position is corrected for using the distribution of the measured energy within the array. For uniform illumination of a crystal with 120 GeV electrons a resolution of 0.5% was achieved. The energy resolution meets the design goal for the detector. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

Combining the Bs0→Ds(*)-π+, Bs0→Ds(*)-ρ+, Bs0→J/ψ, and Bs0→J/ψη decay modes, a significant Bs0 signal is observed. The ratio σ(e+e-→Bs*B̄s*)/σ(e+e-→Bs(*) B̄s(*))=(93-9+7±1)% is obtained at the Υ(5S) energy, indicating that Bs0 meson production proceeds predominantly through the creation of Bs*B̄s* pairs.

34247648309	CMS physics technical design report, volume II: Physics performance	CMS is a general purpose experiment, designed to study the physics of pp collisions at 14 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It currently involves more than 2000 physicists from more than 150 institutes and 37 countries. The LHC will provide extraordinary opportunities for particle physics based on its unprecedented collision energy and luminosity when it begins operation in 2007. The principal aim of this report is to present the strategy of CMS to explore the rich physics programme offered by the LHC. This volume demonstrates the physics capability of the CMS experiment. The prime goals of CMS are to explore physics at the TeV scale and to study the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking - through the discovery of the Higgs particle or otherwise. To carry out this task, CMS must be prepared to search for new particles, such as the Higgs boson or supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model particles, from the start-up of the LHC since new physics at the TeV scale may manifest itself with modest data samples of the order of a few fb

We measure the branching fractions B(B+→K̄0K+)=(1.22-0.28-0.16+0.32+0.13)×10-6 and B(B0→K̄0K0)=(0.87-0.20+0.25±0.09)×10-6, and partial-rate asymmetries ACP(B+→K̄0K+)=0.13-0.24+0.23±0.02 and ACP(B0→K̄0K0)=-0.58-0.66+0.73±0.04.

The first and second error in the branching fractions and the partial-rate asymmetries are statistical and systematic, respectively.

77954594464	Transverse-momentum and pseudorapidity distributions of charged hadrons in pp collisions at √s=7TeV	Charged-hadron transverse-momentum and pseudorapidity distributions in proton-proton collisions at √s=7TeV are measured with the inner tracking system of the CMS detector at the LHC. The charged-hadron yield is obtained by counting the number of reconstructed hits, hit pairs, and fully reconstructed charged-particle tracks. The combination of the three methods gives a charged-particle multiplicity per unit of pseudorapidity dNch/ dη|η|<0.5 = 5.78 ± 0.01(stat)±0.23(syst) for non-single-diffractive events, higher than predicted by commonly used models. The relative increase in charged-particle multiplicity from √s=0.9 to 7 TeV is [66.1±1.0(stat)±4.2(syst)]%. The mean transverse momentum is measured to be 0.545±0.005(stat)±0.015(syst)GeV/c.

80052529242	Reducing support loss in micromechanical ring resonators using phononic band-gap structures	In micromechanical resonators, energy loss via supports into the substrates may lead to a low quality factor. To eliminate the support loss, in this paper a phononic band-gap structure is employed. We demonstrate a design of phononic-crystal (PC) strips used to support extensional wine-glass mode ring resonators to increase the quality factor. The PC strips are introduced to stop elastic-wave propagation by the band-gap and deaf-band effects. Analyses of resonant characteristics of the ring resonators and the dispersion relations, eigenmodes, and transmission properties of the PC strips are presented. With the proposed resonator architecture, the finite-element simulations show that the leaky power is effectively reduced and the stored energy inside the resonators is enhanced simultaneously as the operating frequencies of the resonators are within the band gap or deaf bands. Realization of a high quality factor micromechanical ring resonator with minimized support loss is expected. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The data were collected on the Υ(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy e+e- collider. Combining our analysis with information on charged B decay modes, we perform a full Dalitz and isospin analysis and obtain a constraint on the quark mixing angle 2, 68°< 2<95° at the 68.3% confidence level for the 2 solution consistent with the standard model. A large standard-model-disfavored region also remains. The branching fractions for the decay processes B0→ρ±(770)π and B0→ρ0(770)π0 are measured to be (22.6±1.1[stat]±4.4[syst])×10-6 and (3.0±0.5[stat] ±0.7[syst])×10-6, respectively.

A clear peak with a significance of 8.2σ is observed in the Λc+Λc- invariant mass distribution just above threshold.

The branching fraction obtained is (25.24±0.01±0.39)%, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. The unfolded π-π0 mass spectrum is used to determine resonance parameters for the ρ(770), ρ′(1450), and ρ′′(1700) mesons. We also use this spectrum to estimate the hadronic (2π) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon (aμππ). Our result for aμππ integrated over the mass range s=2mπ-1.8GeV/c2 is aμππ=(523.5±1.5(exp)±2.6(Br) ±2.5(isospin))×10-10, where the first error is due to the experimental uncertainties, the second is due to the uncertainties in the branching fractions, and the third is due to the uncertainties in the isospin-violating corrections. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

These results are obtained from a data sample containing 657×106 BB̄ pairs collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. We set an upper limit on B(B0→ρ0ρ0) of 1.0×10-6 at the 90% confidence level (C.L.). From our B0→ρ0ρ0 measurement and an isospin analysis, we determine the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa phase 2 to be 91.7±14.9 degrees.

62749151854	Intercalibration of the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter of the CMS experiment at start-up	Calibration of the relative response of the individual channels of the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter of the CMS detector was accomplished, before installation, with cosmic ray muons and test beams. One fourth of the calorimeter was exposed to a beam of high energy electrons and the relative calibration of the channels, the intercalibration, was found to be reproducible to a precision of about 0.3%. Additionally, data were collected with cosmic rays for the entire ECAL barrel during the commissioning phase. By comparing the intercalibration constants obtained with the electron beam data with those from the cosmic ray data, it is demonstrated that the latter provide an intercalibration precision of 1.5% over most of the barrel ECAL. The best intercalibration precision is expected to come from the analysis of events collected in situ during the LHC operation. Using data collected with both electrons and pion beams, several aspects of the intercalibration procedures based on electrons or neutral pions were investigated. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

In the former case the J/ψ and a charmed hadron are reconstructed, while the latter process is measured using the recoil mass technique, which allows the identification of two-body final states without reconstruction of one of the charmonia. The measured e+e-→J/ψcc̄ cross section is (0.74±0.08+0.09-0.08)pb, and the e+e-→J/ψXnon- cc̄ cross section is (0.43±0.09±0.09)pb. We note that the measured cross sections are obtained from a data sample with the multiplicity of charged tracks in the event larger than 4; corrections for the effect of this requirement are not performed as this cannot be done in a model-independent way.

The results are based on a 223fb-1 data sample collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB e+e- collider. Clear peaks due to the a0(980) and a2(1320) are visible. The differential cross sections are fitted in the energy region 0.9GeV<W<1.46GeV to obtain the parameters of the a0(980). Its mass, width and ΓγγB(ηπ0) are measured to be 982.3-0.7-4.7+0.6+3. 1MeV/c2, 75.6±1.6-10.0+17.4MeV and 128-2-43+3+502eV, respectively. The energy and angular dependences above 3.1 GeV are compared with those measured in the π0π0 channel. The integrated cross section over θ*|<0. 8 has a W-n dependence with n=10.5±1.2±0.5, which is slightly larger than that for π0π0. The differential cross sections show a sin-4θ* dependence similar to γγ→π0π0.

We show the influence of different cutting ways is crucial to the band-gap formation, and four types of native strip modes are deserved to be fully taken into account. The results show that though there is no band gap existing in the phononic-crystal plates with a low filling fraction, band gaps are created in their corresponding cut strip waveguide because the derivative traction-free boundaries strongly modulate the shear-horizontal bands. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

To our knowledge, this is the widest range of momenta in which any calorimeter system has been studied. These tests, carried out at the H2 beam-line at CERN, provide a wealth of information, especially at low energies. The analysis of the differences in calorimeter response to charged pions, kaons, protons and antiprotons and a detailed discussion of the underlying phenomena are presented. We also show techniques that apply corrections to the signals from the considerably different electromagnetic (EB) and hadronic (HB) barrel calorimeters in reconstructing the energies of hadrons. Above 5 GeV/c, these corrections improve the energy resolution of the combined system where the stochastic term equals 84.7 ± 1.6% and the constant term is 7.4 ± 0.8%.

The data sample of the study corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.9pb⊃-1 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The dijet centrality ratio, which quantifies the angular distribution of the dijets, is measured as a function of the invariant mass of the dijet system and is found to agree with the predictions of the standard model. A statistical analysis of the data provides a lower limit on the energy scale of quark contact interactions. The sensitivity of the analysis is such that the expected limit is 2.9 TeV; because the observed value of the centrality ratio at high invariant mass is below the expectation, the observed limit is 4.0 TeV at the 95% confidence level. © 2010 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

The positions of the modules were determined with respect to cosmic ray trajectories to an average precision of 3-4 microns RMS in the barrel and 3-14 microns RMS in the endcap in the most sensitive coordinate. The results have been validated by several studies, including laser beam cross-checks, track fit self-consistency, track residuals in overlapping module regions, and track parameter resolution, and are compared with predictions obtained from simulation. Correlated systematic effects have been investigated. The track parameter resolutions obtained with this alignment are close to the design performance. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

78651331232	Measurement of ηη production in two-photon collisions	We report the first measurement of the differential cross section for the process γγ→ηη in the kinematic range above the ηη threshold, 1.096GeV<W<3.8GeV over nearly the entire solid angle range, |cosθ⊃*|≤0.9 or ≤1.0 depending on W, where W and θ⊃* are the energy and η scattering angle, respectively, in the γγ center-of-mass system.

79951781401	Alignment of the CMS muon system with cosmic-ray and beam-halo muons	The CMS muon system has been aligned using cosmic-ray muons collected in 2008 and beam-halo muons from the 2008 LHC circulating beam tests. After alignment, the resolution of the most sensitive coordinate is 80 microns for the relative positions of superlayers in the same barrel chamber and 270 microns for the relative positions of endcap chambers in the same ring structure. The resolution on the position of the central barrel chambers relative to the tracker is comprised between two extreme estimates, 200 and 700 microns, provided by two complementary studies. With minor modifications, the alignment procedures can be applied using muons from LHC collisions, leading to additional significant improvements. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

79951493861	Performance of CMS muon reconstruction in cosmic-ray events	The performance of muon reconstruction in CMS is evaluated using a large data sample of cosmic-ray muons recorded in 2008. Efficiencies of various high-level trigger, identification, and reconstruction algorithms have been measured for a broad range of muon momenta, and were found to be in good agreement with expectations from Monte Carlo simulation. The relative momentum resolution for muons crossing the barrel part of the detector is better than 1% at 10 GeV/c and is about 8% at 500 GeV/c, the latter being only a factor of two worse than expected with ideal alignment conditions. Muon charge misassignment ranges from less than 0.01% at 10GeV/c to about 1% at 500 GeV/c. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

79953014406	Search for supersymmetry in pp collisions at 7 TeV in events with jets and missing transverse energy	A search for supersymmetry with R-parity conservation in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is presented. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35 pb-1 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is performed in events with jets and significant missing transverse energy, characteristic of the decays of heavy, pair-produced squarks and gluinos. The primary background, from standard model multijet production, is reduced by several orders of magnitude to a negligible level by the application of a set of robust kinematic requirements. With this selection, the data are consistent with the standard model backgrounds, namely tt, W. +. jet and Z. +. jet production, which are estimated from data control samples. Limits are set on the parameters of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model. These limits extend those set previously by experiments at the Tevatron and LEP colliders. © 2011 CMS Collaboration.

79953270700	Identification and filtering of uncharacteristic noise in the CMS hadron calorimeter	Commissioning studies of the CMS hadron calorimeter have identified sporadic uncharacteristic noise and a small number of malfunctioning calorimeter channels. Algorithms have been developed to identify and address these problems in the data. The methods have been tested on cosmic ray muon data, calorimeter noise data, and single beam data collected with CMS in 2008. The noise rejection algorithms can be applied to LHC collision data at the trigger level or in the offline analysis. The application of the algorithms at the trigger level is shown to remove 90% of noise events with fake missing transverse energy above 100 GeV, which is sufficient for the CMS physics trigger operation. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

79953272770	Aligning the CMS muon chambers with the muon alignment system during an extended cosmic ray run	The alignment system for the muon spectrometer of the CMS detector comprises three independent subsystems of optical and analog position sensors. It aligns muon chambers with respect to each other and to the central silicon tracker. System commissioning at full magnetic field began in 2008 during an extended cosmic ray run. The system succeeded in tracking muon detector movements of up to 18 mm and rotations of several milliradians under magnetic forces. Depending on coordinate and subsystem, the system achieved chamber alignment precisions of 140-350 μm and 30-200 μrad, close to the precision requirements of the experiment. Systematic errors on absolute positions are estimated to be 340-590 μm based on comparisons with independent photogrammetry measurements. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

79953291716	Fine synchronization of the CMS muon drift-tube local trigger using cosmic rays	The CMS experiment uses self-triggering arrays of drift tubes in the barrel muon trigger to perform the identification of the correct bunch crossing. The identification is unique only if the trigger chain is correctly synchronized. In this paper, the synchronization performed during an extended cosmic ray run is described and the results are reported.

79953292010	Calibration of the CMS drift tube chambers and measurement of the drift velocity with cosmic rays	This paper describes the calibration procedure for the drift tubes of the CMS barrel muon system and reports the main results obtained with data collected during a high statistics cosmic ray data-taking period. The main goal of the calibration is to determine, for each drift cell, the minimum time delay for signals relative to the trigger, accounting for the drift velocity within the cell. The accuracy of the calibration procedure is influenced by the random arrival time of the cosmic muons relative to the LHC clock cycle. A more refined analysis of the drift velocity was performed during the offline reconstruction phase, which takes into account this feature of cosmic ray events. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

79954539022	Design of lossless anchors for microacoustic-wave resonators utilizing phononic crystal strips	In micromechanical acoustic-wave resonators, energy dissipation through the anchors into the substrates may result in a low quality (Q) factor. To eliminate the ill effect of anchor losses, a design of lossless anchor based on phononic crystal (PC) strips for the microacoustic-wave resonators is presented. PC strips with acoustic forbidden bands are introduced to suppress the anchor loss and to serve as the suspensions for bar-type resonators. Numerical analysis shows that the acoustic energy leak can be effectively suppressed and the stored energy inside the resonators can be enhanced. A high-Q resonator with minimized anchor loss is expected. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

84860356204	Phononic crystal strips for engineering micromechanical resonators	In micromechanical resonators, energy loss via anchors into the substrates decreases quality factors. To eliminate the anchor loss, a phononic band-gap structure is proposed and employed. In this paper, we investigate the elastic wave propagation in phononic crystal strips, cut from a silicon phononic crystal slab consisting of square-lattice vacuum holes, by analyzing the dispersion relations, acoustic eignemodes, and transmission properties. The phononic crystal strips are applied to devise the anchor-loss free micromechanical resonators and enhance resonator performances. The phononic crystal strips are found to have frequency forbidden bands and are introduced to eliminate the anchor loss in the bar-type and ring-type resonators. Numerical analysis shows that the phononic crystal strips can effectively suppress the acoustic energy leak and increase the stored energy inside the resonators. Realization of a high quality factor micromechanical resonator with minimized anchor loss is expected. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

84869053061	Reducing anchor loss in micromechanical resonators using phononic crystal strips	In micromechanical resonators, energy loss via the anchors into the substrates may lead to a low quality factor. To eliminate the ill effect of anchor loss, in this paper a phononic band-gap structure is employed. We demonstrate a design of phononic-crystal (PnC) strips used to support extensional wine-glass mode ring resonators to increase the quality factors. PnC strips are introduced here to stop elastic wave propagation by the band-gap or deaf-band effects. Numerical analyses of resonant characteristics of the ring resonators and the dispersion relations, eigenmodes, and transmission properties of the PnC strips are presented. With the proposed resonator architecture, the finite-element simulations show that the leaky power is effectively reduced and the stored energy inside the resonators is enhanced simultaneously as the operating frequencies of the resonators are within the band gap or deaf bands. Realization of a high quality-factor micromechanical ring resonator with minimized support loss is expected. © 2011 IEEE.
