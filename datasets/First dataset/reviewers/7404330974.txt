9944265463	Classification of jinjiang oysters Crassostrea rivularis (Gould, 1861) from China, based on morphology and phylogenetic analysis	The jinjiang oyster Crassostrea rivularis [Gould, 1861. Descriptions of shells collected in the North Pacific Exploring Expedition under Captains Ringgold and Rodgers. Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist. 8 (April), 33-40] is one of the most important and best-known oysters in China. Based on the color of its flesh, two forms of C. rivularis are recognized and referred to as the "white meat" and "red meat" oysters. The classification of white and red forms of this species has been a subject of confusion and debate in China. To clarify the taxonomic status of the two forms of C. rivularis, we collected and analyzed oysters from five locations along China's coast using both morphological characters and DNA sequences from mitochondrial 16S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase I, and the nuclear 28S rRNA genes. Oysters were classified as white or red forms according to their morphological characteristics and then subjected to DNA sequencing. Both morphological and DNA sequence data suggest that the red and white oysters are two separate species. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences obtained in this study and existing sequences of reference species show that the red oyster is the same species as C. ariakensis Wakiya [1929. Japanese food oysters. Jpn. J. Zool. 2, 359-367.], albeit the red oysters from north and south China are genetically distinctive. The white oyster is the same species as a newly described species from Hong Kong, C. hongkongensis Lam and Morton [2003. Mitochondrial DNA and identification of a new species of Crassostrea (Bivalvia: Ostreidae) cultured for centuries in the Pearl River Delta, Hong Kong, China. Aqua. 228, 1-13]. Although the name C. rivularis has seniority over C. ariakensis and C. hongkongensis, the original description of Ostrea rivularis by Gould [1861] does not fit shell characteristics of either the red or the white oysters. We propose that the name of C. rivularis Gould [1861] should be suspended, the red oyster should take the name C. ariakensis, and the white oyster should take the name C. hongkongensis. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

1642264030	AFLP-based genetic linkage maps of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas Thunberg	Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were used for genome mapping in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas Thunberg. Seventeen selected primer combinations produced 1106 peaks, of which 384 (34.7%) were polymorphic in a backcross family. Among the polymorphic markers, 349 were segregating through either the female or the male parent. Chi-square analysis indicated that 255 (73.1%) of the markers segregated in a Mendelian ratio, and 94 (26.9%) showed significant (P < 0.05) segregation distortion. Separate genetic linkage maps were constructed for the female and male parents. The female framework map consisted of 119 markers in 11 linkage groups, spanning 1030.7 cM, with an average interval of 9.5 cM per marker. The male map contained 96 markers in 10 linkage groups, covering 758.4 cM, with 8.8 cM per marker. The estimated genome length of the Pacific oyster was 1258 cM for the female and 933 cM for the male, and the observed coverage was 82.0% for the female map and 81.3% for the male map. Most distorted markers were deficient for homozygotes and closely linked to each other on the genetic map, suggesting the presence of major recessive deleterious genes in the Pacific oyster.

19044365792	A preliminary genetic map of Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri Jones et Preston 1904)	Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri Jones et Preston 1904) is one of the most important aquaculture species in China. The development of a genetic linkage map would provide a powerful tool for the genetic improvement of this species. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) is a PCR-based technique that has proven to be powerful in genome fingerprinting and mapping, and population analysis. Genetic maps of C. farreri were constructed using AFLP markers and a full-sib family with 60 progeny. A total of 503 segregating AFLP markers were obtained, with 472 following the Mendelian segregation ratio of 1:1 and 31 markers showing significant (P < 0.05) segregation distortion. The male map contained 166 informative AFLP markers in 23 linkage groups covering 2468 cM. The average distance between markers was 14.9 cM. The female genetic map consisted of 198 markers in 25 linkage groups spanning 3130 cM with an average inter-marker spacing of 15.8 cM. DNA polymorphisms that segregated in a 3:1 ratio as well as the AFLP markers that were heterozygous in both parents were included to construct combined linkage genetic map. Five shared linkage groups, ranging from 61.1 to 162.5 cM, were identified between the male and female maps, covering 431 cM. Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers appeared to be evenly distributed within the linkage groups. Although preliminary, these maps provide a starting point for the mapping of the functional genes and quantitative trait loci in C. farreri. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

23044506489	Inbreeding depression and maternal effects on early performance of Pacific abalone	Effects of inbreeding and maternity on early performance were studied in the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai using two sets of 2 x 2 factorial crosses involving sister-brother mating. Parents from three full-sib families produced from two wild abalone populations (Japan and China) were used for the study. Metamorphic success and larval growth in four inbred (F = 0.25) and four outbred families were evaluated to 20 d postfertilization. In set I, inbreeding depression was 8.65% for metamorphic success, and -1.06, 3.25, and 4.98% for larval size at days 6, 10, and 20, respectively. In set II, inbreeding depression was 39.3% for metamorphic success, and 1.92, 4.99, and 3.37% for size at days 6, 10, and 20, respectively. Additionally, there were significant maternal effects on metamorphosis and larval size on day 6 (P < 0.01) in set I, which became insignificant at days 10 and 20. Maternal effects were absent in set II. The results of this study suggest that inbreeding at F = 0.25 significantly affects larval growth and greatly reduces metamorphic success in the Pacific abalone. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2005.

0030865052	Chromosome segregation in fertilized eggs from triploid pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg), following inhibition of polar body 1	Chromosome segregation in fertilized eggs from triploid Pacific oysters, following inhibition of the first polar body (PB1), was studied with acetic orcein staining techniques. To block the release of PB1, fertilized eggs were treated with 0.5 mg/l of cytochalasin B (CB). Four types of segregation were observed, namely, 'tripolar segregation' (54.5%), 'united bipolar segregation' (12%), 'separated bipolar segregation' (2.5%), and 'incomplete united bipolar segregation' (4%). The remaining 23% could not be classified because of chromosome disorganization, but appeared to be variants of the above. It seemed clear that the predominant pattern that gave rise to tetraploids was united bipolar segregation, although certain separated bipolar segregations might also lead to the formation of tetraploids. The sequential events of meioses observed in CB-treated eggs are described. The asynchrony of meiotic events and possible mechanisms for the various types of chromosome segregation are discussed.

23944488474	Characterization of eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin) chromosomes by fluorescence in situ hybridization with bacteriophage P1 clones	Chromosome identification is an essential step in genomic research, which so far has not been possible in oysters. We tested bacteriophage P1 clones for chromosomal identification in the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). P1 clones were labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP using nick translation. Hybridization was detected with fluorescein-isothiocyanate-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibodies and amplified with 2 layers of antibodies. Nine of the 21 P1 clones tested produced clear and consistent FISH signals when Cot-1 DNA was used as a blocking agent against repetitive sequences. Karyotypic analysis and cohybridization positively assigned the 9 P1 clones to 7 chromosomes. The remaining 3 chromosomes can be separated by size and arm ratio. Five of the 9 P1 clones were sequenced at both ends, providing sequence-tagged sites that can be used to integrate linkage and cytogenetic maps. One sequence is part of the bone morphogenetic protein type 1b receptor, a member of the transforming growth factor superfamily, and mapped to the telomeric region of the long arm of chromosome 2. This study shows that large-insert clones such as P1 are useful as chromosome-specific FISH probes and for gene mapping in oysters. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.

28444441990	Studies on mass summer mortality of cultured zhikong scallops (Chlamys farreri Jones et Preston) in China	Mass mortalities of cultured zhikong scallops (Chlamys farreri) have occurred each summer in most culture areas of northern China since 1996. Among the hypothesized causes are high culture density, infectious disease and genetic inbreeding. To investigate these potential agents, C. farreri were deployed at three densities (low, medium and high) at three sites (Jiaonan, Penglai and Yantai) in the summer of 2000. Scallops were sampled for survival, growth and histopathology before, during and after a mortality episode. Most of the mortality occurred in July and August, during and toward the later part of the spawning season, when water temperature reached 23-26°C. Final cumulative mortalities reached 85% to 90% at all three sites. Scallops in the medium and high densities had higher initial death rates than did those at the low density. High densities also inhibited growth. Ciliates from the genus Trichodina, larvae of various organisms and anomalous secretions were observed in sections of the gill cavity, with highest prevalence during and at the end of the mortality period. Prokaryotic inclusion bodies were found in the soft tissues, but their prevalence was low and apparently without correlation with mortalities. Genetic analysis with random amplified polymorphic DNA markers showed slightly lower heterozygosity in the cultured stocks (0.301) than in the wild stocks (0.331). It is possible that the mortalities are caused by a combination of several factors such as stress associated with reproduction, high temperature, overcrowding and poor circulation in the growout cages, opportunistic invaders or pathogens, and possibly inbreeding. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

33646142285	Identification and mapping of disease-resistance QTLs in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica Gmelin	Identification and mapping of disease-resistance QTLs (quantitative trait loci) is important for our understanding of genetic mechanisms of disease-resistance and for our ability to genetically improve cultured stocks. Disease-resistance is the most important trait for farmers of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin), which is affected by two major diseases: MSX and Dermo. In this study, the genome of the eastern oyster was scanned with a large number of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers before and after Dermo-inflicted mortalities (53% and 67%) in two reference families. Significant post-mortality shifts in genotype frequency were detected at a large number of loci. Linkage analysis revealed that most markers showing frequency shifts are closely linked to each other on the genetic map, and all markers within a cluster had frequency shifts in the same direction according to their linkage phase. This finding suggests that post-mortality shifts in genotype frequency were not random, but linked to Dermo/summer mortality-resistance QTLs. Twelve putative Dermo/summer mortality-resistance QTLs were identified on female and male maps from two families, providing candidate genome regions for further analysis. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

33646892442	Sustained response to selection in an introduced population of the hermaphroditic bay scallop Argopecten irradians irradians Lamarck (1819)	Introduced species often start with limited genetic variability, which is problematic for selective breeding. The problem of inbreeding can be exasperated by hermaphroditism. The bay scallop Argopecten irradians irradians is a hermaphroditic species that has been introduced to and now supports a major aquaculture industry in China. Positive response to selection for fast growth was observed in one of the less inbred stocks in a previous study. In this study, we evaluated selection for the second generation to determine if response to selection can be sustained in this introduced population of a hermaphroditic species. Response to selection, realized heritability for the second generation, cumulative (over two generations), current (for the second generation) and residual (from the first generation) genetic gains were estimated by comparing three different types of lines: SS (selected for two generation), SC (selected for the first generation only) and CC (unselected for two generations). The SS line grew significantly faster (P < 0.05) than the other two lines, indicating that the second generation selection for faster growth is still effective. Response to selection and realized heritability for the second generation were 0.612 ± 0.101 and 0.349 ± 0.057, respectively, which are similar to those observed for the first generation. The cumulative, current, and residual gains were 17.56 ± 5.30%, 10.63 ± 2.46%, and 6.25 ± 3.13%, respectively. The sustained response to selection for the second generation observed here suggests that considerable genetic variability exists in this population and that future efforts on selective breeding are likely to be fruitful. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

33646476745	Development of expressed sequence tags from the bay scallop, Argopecten irradians irradians	The bay scallop, Argopecten irradians irradians, introduced from North America, has become one of the most important aquaculture species in China. Inan effort to identify scallop genes involved in host defense, a high-quality cDNA library was constructed from whole body tissues of the bay scallop. A total of 5828 successful sequencing reactions yielded 4995 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) longer than 100 bp. Cluster and assembly analyses of the ESTs identified 637 contigs (consisting of 2853 sequences) and 2142 singletons, totaling 2779 unique sequences. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis showed that the majority (73%) of the unique sequences had no significant homology (E-value ≤ 0.005) to sequences in GenBank. Among the 748 sequences with significant GenBank matches, 160 (21.4%) were for genes related to metabolism, 131 (17.5%) for cell/organism defense, 124 (16.6%) for gene/protein expression, 83 (11.1%) for cell structure/motility, 70 (9.4%) for cell signaling/communication, 17 (2.3%) for cell division, and 163 (21.8%) matched to genes of unknown functions. The list of host-defense genes included many genes with known and important roles in innate defense such as lectins, defensins, proteases, protease inhibitors, heat shock proteins, antioxidants, and Toll-like receptors. The study provides a significant number of ESTs for gene discovery and candidate genes for studying host defense in scallops and other molluscs. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.

33746921580	Chromosomal mapping of 5s ribosomal RNA genes in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica Gmelin by fluorescence in situ hybridization	Chromosomal location of the 5S ribosomal RNA gene was studied in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica Gmelin, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Metaphase chromosomes were obtained from early embryos, and the FISH probe was made by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of the 5S rRNA gene and labeled by incorporation of digoxigenin-11-dUTP during PCR. Hybridization was detected with fluorescein-labeled antidigoxigenin antibodies. Two pairs of FISH signals were observed on metaphase chromosomes. Karyotypic analysis showed that the 5S rRNA gene cluster is interstitially located on short arms of chromosomes 5 and 6. On chromosome 5, the 5S rRNA genes were located immediately next to the centromere, whereas on chromosome 6, they were located approximately half way between the telomere and the centromere. Chromosomes of C. virginica are difficult to identify because of their similarities in size and arm ratio, and the chromosomal location of 5S rRNA genes provides unambiguous identification of chromosomes 5 and 6. Previous studies have mapped the major rRNA gene cluster (18S-5.8S-28S) to chromosome 2, and this study shows that the 5S rRNA gene cluster is not linked to the major rRNA genes and duplicated during evolution.

33750506294	Tetraploid induction by inhibiting mitosis I with heat shock, cold shock, and nocodazole in the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria (Linnaeus, 1758)	Tetraploid induction by inhibiting mitosis I with heat shock (32, 35, and 38°C), cold shock (1, 4, and 7°C), and nocodazole (0.02 to 1.6 mg/L) was investigated in the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria. All treatments were applied to fertilized eggs about 5 min before the first cell division at 22 to 23°C, and lasted for 10, 15, and 20 min. Three replicates were produced for each treatment with different parents. The ploidy of resultant larvae and juveniles was determined with flow cytometry. Heat shock of 35 and 38°C was effective in inhibiting mitosis I, producing 54% to 89% tetraploid larvae. Heat shock of 32°C accelerated embryonic development without inhibiting mitosis or producing tetraploids. In all heat-shock groups, the survival to D-stage larvae was lower than in controls, suggesting that heat-shock treatments and tetraploidy were detrimental to larval development. At the juvenile stage, survivors from heat-shock groups contained no tetraploids. Cold shocks suspended the first cell division during the treatment, but produced no tetraploids in the 4°C and 7°C treatment groups. Cold shock of 1°C produced 31% tetraploid larvae in one replicate, with none surviving to juvenile stage. Nocodazole inhibited mitosis I at concentrations of 0.04 mg/L or higher, but did not produce tetraploids. This study indicates that heat shock is most effective in inducing tetraploids through mitosis I inhibition, although none of the induced tetraploids survived to juvenile stage. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.

33845906623	Heterosis between two stocks of the bay scallop, Argopecten irradians irradians Lamarck (1819)	Heterosis between two stocks (A and B) of the bay scallop Argopecten irradians irradians (Lamarck, 1819) was studied by comparing performance in hatching success, larval survival, larval, spat and adult growth of reciprocal hybrid crosses (AB and BA) and that of two parental groups (AA and BB). Stock A is derived from the initial 1982 introduction from Connecticut, USA and expected to be highly inbred because of the small founder population (26 individuals) and the long breeding history (20 + generations). Stock B is the fourth generation from a 1999 introduction from Virginia and Massachusetts, USA, which is expected to have higher heterozygosity caused by a larger founder population (200 wild and 206 first generation cultured individuals) and a short breeding history. Both hybrid crosses demonstrated positive heterosis for all traits studied, although the magnitude of heterosis varied among traits and life history stages. Midparent heterosis was 7.9% for hatching success, 10.8% and 3.0% for larval survival and growth and 8.4% and 10.9% for juvenile and adult growth. Single-parent heterosis also varied among traits. For fitness related traits such as hatching success and larval survival, single-parent heterosis was positive for both parental stocks. Single-parent heterosis for growth, a morphological trait, was positive in stock A and negative in stock B.

33847256030	Chromosomal mapping of major ribosomal rRNA genes in the hard clam (Mercenaria mercenaria) using fluorescence in situ hybridization	Karyotype and chromosomal location of the major ribosomal RNA genes were studied in the hard clam (Mercenaria mercenaria Linnaeus) using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Metaphase chromosomes were obtained from early embryos. Internal transcribed spacers (ITS) between major RNA genes were amplified and used as FISH probes. The probes were labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP by polymerase chain reaction and detected with fluorescein-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibodies. FISH with the ITS probes produced two to four signals per nucleus or metaphase. M. mercenaria had a haploid number of 19 chromosomes with a karyotype of seven metacentric, four metacentric or submetacentric, seven submetacentric, and one submetacentric or subtelocentric chromosomes (7M + 4M/SM + 7SM + 1SM/ST). Two ITS loci were observed: one located near the centromere on the long arm of Chromosome 10 and the other at the telomere of the short arm of Chromosome 12. FISH signals on Chromosome 10 are strong and consistent, while signals on Chromosome 12 are variable. This study provides the first karyotype and chromosomal assignment of the major RNA genes in M. mercenaria. Similar studies in a wide range of species are needed to understand the role of chromosomal changes in bivalve evolution. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

33847745729	Genetic linkage map of bay scallop, Argopecten irradians irradians (Lamarck 1819)	The bay scallop (Argopecten irradians irradians Lamarck 1819) has become one of the most important aquaculture species in China. Genetic improvement of cultured bay scallop can benefit greatly from a better understanding of its genome. In this study, we developed amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and simple sequence repeat markers from expressed sequence tags (EST-SSRs) for linkage analysis in bay scallop. Segregation of 390 AFLP and eight SSR markers was analysed in a mapping population of 97 progeny. Of the AFLP markers analysed, 326 segregated in the expected 1:1 Mendelian ratio, while the remaining 74 (or 19.0%) showed significant deviation, with 33 (44.6%) being deficient in heterozygotes (A/a). Among the eight polymorphic EST-SSR loci, one marker (12.5%) was found skewing from its expected Mendelian ratios. Eighteen per cent of the markers segregating from female parent were distorted compared with 21% of the markers segregating from male parent. The female map included 147 markers in 17 linkage groups (LGs) and covered 1892.4 cM of the genome. In the male map, totally 146 AFLP and SSR markers were grouped in 18 LGs spanning 1937.1 cM. The average inter-marker spacing in female and male map was 12.9 and 13.3 cM respectively. The AFLP and SSR markers were distributed evenly throughout the genome except for a few large gaps over 20 cM. Although preliminary, the genetic maps presented here provide a starting point for the mapping of the bay scallop genome. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

34548262219	Loss of allele diversity in introduced populations of the hermaphroditic bay scallop Argopecten irradians	The bay scallop Argopecten irradians is a hermaphroditic bivalve native to the Atlantic coast of the United States that was introduced to China for aquaculture production in 1982. It now supports a major aquaculture industry in China. Introduced species often start with limited genetic variability, which is problematic for the further selective breeding. Bay scallop aquaculture is exclusively hatchery based and as the initial introduction consisted of only 26 scallops, there have been concerns about inbreeding and inbreeding depression in cultured populations in China. In this study, eleven simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to compare genetic variation in cultured populations from China with that in a natural population from the east coast of America. Although the difference in heterozygosity was small, the Chinese populations lost 9 of the 45 alleles (20%) found in the wild population. The reduced allele diversity suggests that the Chinese bay scallop populations experienced a bottleneck in genetic diversity that remains significant despite several recent introductions of new stocks aimed at expanding the gene pool. The loss of allele diversity may affect future efforts in selective breeding and domestication, and results of this study highlight the need for additional introductions, advanced breeding programs that minimize inbreeding and continued genetic monitoring. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

35848944129	Genetic mapping of size-related quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the bay scallop (Argopecten irradians) using AFLP and microsatellite markers	We constructed genetic linkage maps for the bay scallop Argopecten irradians using AFLP and microsatellite markers and conducted composite interval mapping (CIM) of body-size-related traits. Three hundred seventeen AFLP and 10 microsatellite markers were used for map construction. The female parent map contained 120 markers in 15 linkage groups, spanning 479.6 cM with an average interval of 7.0 cM. The male parent map had 190 markers in 17 linkage groups, covering 883.8 cM at 7.2 cM per marker. The observed coverage was 70.4% for the female and 81.1% for the male map. Markers that were distorted toward the same direction were closely linked to each other on the genetic maps, suggesting the presence of genes important for survival. Six size-related traits, shell length, shell height, shell width, total weight, soft tissue weight, and shell weight, were measured for QTL mapping. The size data were significantly correlated with each other. We subjected the data, log transformed firstly, to a principle component analysis and use the first principle component for QTL mapping. CIM analysis revealed one significant QTL (LOD = 2.69, 1000 permutation, P < 0.05) in linkage group 3 on the female parent map. The mapping of size-related QTL in this study raises the possibility of improving the growth of bay scallops through marker-assisted selection. © 2007.

0032815497	Molluscan aquaculture in China	Molluscan aquaculture in China has been growing rapidly in the past decade. China produced 6.4 million metric tons (MMT) of mollusks from aquaculture in 1996, an eightfold increase over that of 1986. At least 32 species of marine mollusks are cultured commercially in China. The 1996 production included 2.3 MMT of oysters, 1.6 MMT of clams (mostly Ruditapes, Meretrix, razor clams, and blood cockles), 1 MMT of scallops, 0.4 MMT of mussels, 700 tons of abalone, and 20 tons of marine pearls. Shandong province is the largest producer of cultured mollusks, followed by Guangdong, Fujian, Liaoning, Guangxi, and Zhejiang provinces (ranked 2-6, respectively). As a generalized pattern, molluscan aquaculture in China is characterized by scallops, abalone, and Manila clams in the northern provinces (Shandong and Liaoning), oysters and pearl oysters in the south (Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi), and various clam species in the middle (Zhejiang and Jiangsu). The production technology ranges from simple gathering and stocking of wild seeds for several clam species to sophisticated hatchery and growout operations for abalone and pearl oysters. The rapid development of intensive mariculture during the past decade may have exceeded the carrying capacity of some areas and contributed to deterioration of the culture environment. Abalone and scallop cultures in the north have been seriously affected by diseases and mortalities in recent years.

0033616552	Aneuploid pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas Thunberg) as incidentals from triploid production	Triploids have become an important part of the oyster aquaculture industry. Triploids can be produced by two methods: (1) inhibiting polar body II in normal zygotes; and (2) mating diploids and tetraploids. Both methods can theoretically generate some incidental aneuploids, which in higher animals are often lethal or associated with growth retardation. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of aneuploids in three replicates of a normal diploid group (2N), a cytochalasin B induced triploid (3nCB) and a mated triploid group from diploid female x tetraploid male mating (3nDT), and documented their growth performance. No aneuploids were found in normal diploid groups, and all diploid oysters had exactly the expected diploid number -20 chromosomes. Two of the 90 oysters (2.2%) from 3nCB groups were aneuploids: one with 19 chromosomes (2n - 1) and one with 29 chromosomes (3n - 1). In 3nDT groups, 18 of the 90 oysters (20%) were aneuploids, which included two oysters with 28 chromosomes (3n - 2), 10 with 29 chromosomes (3n - 1) and six with 31 chromosomes (3n + 1). The large numbers of aneuploids from 3nDT groups suggested that meiosis in paternal tetraploids was prone to segregation error. Triploids from 3nDT groups were significantly bigger than normal diploids and 3nCB triploids. Aneuploids were not significantly different from 3nDT triploids in body size. But like 3nDT triploids, aneuploids as a group were significantly bigger than normal diploids and 3nCB triploids. Results of this study support our previous finding that oysters tolerate a number of aneuploid conditions without obvious growth retardation. Certain aneuploids such as monosomics (2n - 1) and trisomics (2n + l) should be useful for genomic dissection and QTL analyses.

0033676679	Tripioid and tetraploid zhikong scallop, Chlamys farreri Jones et Preston, produced by inhibiting polar body I	Triploid scallops are valuable for aquaculture because of their enlarged adductor muscle, and tetraploids are important for the commercial production of triploids. We tested tetraploid induction in the zhikong scallop by inhibiting polar body I in newly fertilized eggs. The ploidy of resultant embryos was determined by chromosome counting at 2- to 4-cell stage and by flow cytometry thereafter. Embryos from the control groups were mostly diploids (79%), along with some aneuploids. Embryos from the treated groups were 13% diploids, 18% triploids, 26% tetraploids, 13% pentaploids, and 36% aneuploids. Tetraploids, pentaploids, and most aneuploids suffered heavy mortality during the first week and became undetectable among the larvae at day 14. Five tetraploids (2%) were found among a sample of 267 spat from one of the replicates, and none was detected at day 450. The adductor muscle of triploid scallops was 44% heavier (P < .01) than that of diploids, confirming the value of the triploid technology in this species.

32344436965	Polyploid induction by heat shock-induced meiosis and mitosis inhibition in the dwarf surfclam, Mulinia lateralis Say	Heat shock is an effective and widely used method for polyploid induction in fish, but has not been well studied in molluscs. In this study, heat shock was tested for polyploid induction through meiosis or mitosis inhibition in the dwarf surfclam, Mulinia lateralis Say. To determine the most effective temperature, different heat shocks (32, 35 and 38°C) were applied to newly fertilized eggs at 8-11 min post-fertilization (MPF) to inhibit the extrusion of polar body 1 (PB1), and ended when the second polar body began to form in control groups. Ploidy of resultant larvae was determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Both 35°C and 38°C were effective in inhibiting PB1, but 38°C led to complete mortality of larvae. Heat shock of 32°C only accelerated embryonic development without inhibiting PB1, as all resultant larvae were diploid. High percentages of triploids (86.3-98.5%) were produced by the 35°C treatment as detected at the juvenile stage. Different durations (10, 15 and 20 min) of the 35°C heat shock were used for PB1-inhibition to test effects on polyploid formation, which produced primarily triploids (10 min) and pentaploids (20 min), but virtually no tetraploids. To inhibit mitosis I (M1) and mitosis II (M2) for tetraploid induction, a heat shock of 35°C was applied to fertilized eggs at 35-37 and 50-57 MPF for about 20 min, producing up to 82.8% and 44.4% tetraploid larvae, respectively. Most tetraploid larvae were abnormal and did not develop to the D-stage, and no tetraploids were observed at the juvenile stage. This study shows that heat shock is a highly effective method for polyploid induction in the dwarf surfclam and possibly in other molluscs also. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

77954543465	Population genetics of Crassostrea ariakensis in Asia inferred from microsatellite markers	Crassostrea ariakensis is an important aquacultured oyster species in Asia, its native region. During the past decade, consideration was given to introducing C. ariakensis into Chesapeake Bay, in the United States, to help revive the declining native oyster industry and bolster the local ecosystem. Little is known about the ecology and biology of this species in Asia due to confusion with nomenclature and difficulty in accurately identifying the species of wild populations in their natural environment. Even less research has been done on the population genetics of native populations of C. ariakensis in Asia. We examined the magnitude and pattern of genetic differentiation among 10 wild populations of C. ariakensis from its confirmed distribution range using eight polymorphic microsatellite markers. Results showed a small but significant global θ

79951559732	Oyster reefs at risk and recommendations for conservation, restoration, and management	Native oyster reefs once dominated many estuaries, ecologically and economically. Centuries of resource extraction exacerbated by coastal degradation have pushed oyster reefs to the brink of functional extinction worldwide. We examined the condition of oyster reefs across 144 bays and 44 ecoregions; our comparisons of past with present abundances indicate that more than 90% of them have been lost in bays (70%) and ecoregions (63%). In many bays, more than 99% of oyster reefs have been lost and are functionally extinct. Overall, we estimate that 85% of oyster reefs have been lost globally. Most of the world's remaining wild capture of native oysters (> 75%) comes from just five ecoregions in North America, yet the condition of reefs in these ecoregions is poor at best, except in the Gulf of Mexico. We identify many cost-effective solutions for conservation, restoration, and the management of fisheries and nonnative species that could reverse these oyster losses and restore reef ecosystem services. © 2011 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.

84867088834	The oyster genome reveals stress adaptation and complexity of shell formation	The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas belongs to one of the most species-rich but genomically poorly explored phyla, the Mollusca. Here we report the sequencing and assembly of the oyster genome using short reads and a fosmid-pooling strategy, along with transcriptomes of development and stress response and the proteome of the shell. The oyster genome is highly polymorphic and rich in repetitive sequences, with some transposable elements still actively shaping variation. Transcriptome studies reveal an extensive set of genes responding to environmental stress. The expansion of genes coding for heat shock protein 70 and inhibitors of apoptosis is probably central to the oyster's adaptation to sessile life in the highly stressful intertidal zone. Our analyses also show that shell formation in molluscs is more complex than currently understood and involves extensive participation of cells and their exosomes. The oyster genome sequence fills a void in our understanding of the Lophotrochozoa. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

84866707139	Laboratory hybridization between two oysters: Crassostrea gigas and crassostrea hongkongensis	Interspecific hybridization is a useful tool in genetic improvement of agriculture and aquaculture species. The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and the Hong Kong oyster (Crassostrea hongkongensis) are both important aquaculture species in China. To determine whether these 2 species can hybridize and produce viable offspring, we conducted 2×2 factorial crosses between them. Asymmetry in fertilization was observed when C. hongkongensis eggs were fertilized readily by C. gigas sperm, but the reciprocal cross resulted in no fertilization. Embryos from C. hongkongensis female × C. gigas male crosses developed normally without noticeable defects, although their survival rate to D-stage was less than embryos of the two intraspecific crosses. From D-stage to metamorphosis, larvae of hybrid crosses had slower growth and a lower survival rate than that of intraspecific crosses. Nevertheless, 0.57% of hybrid D-larvae survived to spat stage at day 90. Hybrid spat had good survival (78.9%) to 1 y of age, but were significantly (P < 0.001) smaller than oysters of intraspecific crosses. Gonadal development was absent or retarded in most hybrids at 1 y of age, although some hybrids (39.2%) produced mature gametes. Our results show that hybridization between C. gigas and C. hongkongensis is possible in one direction. Some hybrids are viable, partly fertile, and can be used potentially for gene introgression between these two species.

84925644219	Genome-wide and single-base resolution DNA methylomes of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas provide insight into the evolution of invertebrate CpG methylation	Background: Studies of DNA methylomes in a wide range of eukaryotes have revealed both conserved and divergent characteristics of DNA methylation among phylogenetic groups. However, data on invertebrates particularly molluscs are limited, which hinders our understanding of the evolution of DNA methylation in metazoa. The sequencing of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas genome provides an opportunity for genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation in this model mollusc. Results: Homologous searches against the C. gigas genome identified functional orthologs for key genes involved in DNA methylation: DNMT1, DNMT2, DNMT3, MBD2/3 and UHRF1. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) of the oyster's mantle tissues revealed that more than 99% methylation modification was restricted to cytosines in CpG context and methylated CpGs accumulated in the bodies of genes that were moderately expressed. Young repeat elements were another major targets of CpG methylation in oysters. Comparison with other invertebrate methylomes suggested that the 5'-end bias of gene body methylation and the negative correlation between gene body methylation and gene length were the derived features probably limited to the insect lineage. Interestingly, phylostratigraphic analysis showed that CpG methylation preferentially targeted genes originating in the common ancestor of eukaryotes rather than the oldest genes originating in the common ancestor of cellular organisms. Conclusions: Comparative analysis of the oyster DNA methylomes and that of other animal species revealed that the characteristics of DNA methylation were generally conserved during invertebrate evolution, while some unique features were derived in the insect lineage. The preference of methylation modification on genes originating in the eukaryotic ancestor rather than the oldest genes is unexpected, probably implying that the emergence of methylation regulation in these 'relatively young' genes was critical for the origin and radiation of eukaryotes.

42449149535	Chromosomal mapping of the major ribosomal RNA genes in the dwarf surfclam (Mulinia lateralis say)	Chromosomal location of the major ribosomal RNA genes (rRNA) were studied in the dwarf surfclam (Mulinia lateralis, Say) using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). FISH probes for the rRNA genes were made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP and detected with fluorescein-labeled antidigoxigenin antibodies. Mulinia lateralis had a diploid number of 38 chromosomes and all chromosomes were telocentric. FISH with the rRNA probe produced positive and consistent signals on two pairs of chromosomes: Chromosome 15 with a relative length of 4.6% and Chromosome 19, the shortest chromosome. Both loci were telomeric. The rRNA location provides the first physical landmark of the M. lateralis genome.

42449153540	Identification of Crassostrea ariakensis and related oysters by multiplex species-specific PCR	Genetic markers are needed for rapid and reliable identification of oysters. In this study, we developed multiplex genus- and species-specific PCR markers for the identification of oysters from China. We used the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and nuclear 28S ribosomal RNA genes for marker development. DNA sequences from different species were obtained from GenBank or by direct sequencing. Sequences were aligned, and genus- and species-specific nucleotides were identified. Primers were designed for genus/species-specific amplification to generate fragments of different sizes. A multiplex set of genus- and species-specific primers from the 28S gene was able to separate C. ariakensis and C. hongkongensis from other species and assign oysters to four genera. A set of species-specific COI primers provided positive identification of all five Crassostrea species from China, C. ariakensis, C. hongkongensis, C. angulata, C. gigas, and C. sikamea in a single PCR. The multiplex PCR assays do not require fluorescence-labeling or post-PCR enzyme digestion, providing a simple, fast and reliable method for the identification of oysters from China.

44449132227	Classification of common oysters from north China	Oysters are commonly found on rocky shores along China's northern coast, although there is considerable confusion as to what species they are. To determine the taxonomic status of these oysters, we collected specimens from nine locations north of the Yangtze River and conducted genetic identification using DNA sequences. Fragments from three genes, mitochondrial 16S rRNA, mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI), and nuclear 28S rRNA, were sequenced in six oysters from each of the nine sites. Phylogenetic analysis of all three gene fragments clearly demonstrated that the small oysters commonly found on intertidal rocks in north China are Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg, 1793), not C. plicatula (the zhe oyster) as widely assumed. Their small size and irregular shell characteristics are reflections of the stressful intertidal environment they live in and not reliable characters for classification. Our study confirms that the oysters from Weifang, referred to as Jinjiang oysters or C. rivularis (Gould, 1861), are C. ariakensis (Wakiya, 1929). We found no evidence for the existence of C. talienwhanensis (Crosse, 1862) and other Crassostrea species in north China. Our study highlights the need for reclassifying oysters of China with molecular data.

44449163051	ITS length polymorphism in oysters and ITS use in species identification	In an effort to develop genetic markers for oyster identification, we studied length polymorphism in internal transcribed spacers (ITS) between major ribosomal RNA genes in 12 common species of Ostreidae: Crassostrea virginica, C. rhizophorae, C. gigas, C. angulata, C. sikamea, C. ariakensis, C. hongkongensis, Saccostrea echinata, S. glomerata, Ostrea angasi, O. edulis, and O. conchaphila. We designed two pairs of primers and optimized PCR conditions for simultaneous amplification of ITS1 and ITS2 in a single PCR. Amplification was successful in all 12 species, and PCR products were visualized on high-resolution agarose gels. ITS2 was longer than ITS1 in all Crassostrea and Saccostrea species, whereas they were about the same size in the three Ostrea species. No intraspecific variation in ITS length was detected. Among species, the length of ITS1 and ITS2 was polymorphic and provided unique identification of 8 species or species pairs: C. ariakensis, C. hongkongensis, C. sikamea, O. conchaphila, C. virginica/C. rhizophorae, C. gigas/C. angulata, S. echinata/S. glomerata, and O. angasi/O. edulis. The ITS assay provides simple, rapid and effective identification of C. ariakensis and several other oyster species. Because the primer sequences are conserved, the ITS assay may be useful in the identification of other bivalve species.

49849090073	Inbreeding depression for various traits in two cultured populations of the American bay scallop, Argopecten irradians irradians Lamarck (1819) introduced into China	This paper examines the effect of inbreeding level of population on the magnitude of inbreeding depression expressed by comparing them between two cultured populations (A and B) in the hermaphroditic animal of the bay scallop Argopecten irradians irradians. Population A is expected to have less genetic variations and higher inbreeding level due to longer cultured history (20 generations) and less "ancestral" individuals (26 individuals) than population B due to shorter cultured history (4 generations) and more "ancestral" individuals (406 individuals). Two groups within each population were produced, one using self-fertilization and one using mass-mating within the same population. Selfed offspring (AS and BS) from two populations both had lower fitness components than their mass-mated counterparts (AM and BM) and exhibited inbreeding depression for all examined traits, e.g. lower hatching, less viability and slower growth, indicating that inbreeding depression is a common feature in this animal. Fitness components in all traits of offspring from population A significantly differed those from population B and the magnitude of inbreeding depression for all traits in population A with higher inbreeding level was significantly smaller than that in population B with lower inbreeding level, indicating that both fitness components and magnitude of inbreeding depression were significantly affected by inbreeding level of populations and genetic load harbored in population A may be partially purged through inbreeding. Moreover, the magnitude of inbreeding depression in the two populations both varied among traits and life history stages. The present results support the partial-dominance hypothesis of inbreeding depression. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A total of 5720 clones were sequenced, yielding 5123 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Among the 3326 unique genes identified, 2289 (69%) genes had no significant (E-value < 1e-5) matches to known sequences in public databases and 194 (6%) matched proteins of unknown functions. The remaining 843 (25%) genes that exhibited homology with genes of known functions, showed broad involvement in metabolic processes (31%), cell structure and motility (20%), gene and protein expression (12%), cell signaling and cell communication (8%), cell division (4%), and notably, 25% of those genes were related to immune function. They included stress response genes, complement-like genes, proteinase and proteinase inhibitors, immune recognition receptors and immune effectors. The EST collection obtained in this study provides a useful resource for gene discovery and especially for the identification of host-defense genes and systems in scallops and other molluscs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

65949095205	Identification and characterization of 66 EST-SSR markers in the Eastern oyster Crassostrea Virginica (Gmelin)	Large numbers of genetic markers are needed for genomic analyses in the eastern oyster (Crassoslrea virginica). We previously identified 53 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from an expressed sequence tag (EST) database using a high selection standard. We mined the same EST database again using a lower threshold (>5 di-nucleotide and 4 other repeats) and identified 330 new SSR-containing ESTs. Primers were designed for 201 suitable sequences, and PCR was successful for 137. The screening of 113 primer pairs that produced fragments shorter than 800 bp produced 66 polymorphic SSR markers, which were characterized in 30 oysters from three populations and a full-sib family. The SSRs had an average of 5.4 alleles per locus, ranging from 2-12. Thirtyfour loci segregated in the family, with seven showing significant deviation from Mendelian ratios after Bonferroni correction. Nullalleles were observed at 17 loci. The EST-derived SSRs are part of expressed genes, and most of them should be useful for gene and genome mapping. This study shows that more SSR markers can be developed from ESTs using lower selection standards.

Six loci showed significant (P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction) deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, probably because of the presence of null alleles. Three primer pairs amplified duplicated loci with two involving tandem mini-satellite repeats.

7044224906	Chromosome inheritance in triploid Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas Thunberg	Reproduction and chromosome inheritance in triploid Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas Thunberg) were studied in diploid female x triploid male (DT) and reciprocal (TD) crosses. Relative fecundity of triploid females was 13.4% of normal diploids. Cumulative survival from fertilized eggs to spat stage was 0.007% for DT crosses and 0.314% for TD crosses. Chromosome number analysis was conducted on surviving progeny from DT and TD crosses at 1 and 4 years of age. At Year 1, oysters from DT crosses consisted of 15% diploids (2n = 20) and 85% aneuploids. In contrast, oysters from TD crosses consisted of 57.2% diploids, 30.9% triploids (3n=30) and only 11.9% aneuploids, suggesting that triploid females produced more euploid gametes and viable progeny than triploid males. Viable aneuploid chromosome numbers included 2n+1, 2n+2, 2n+3, 3n-2 and 3n-1. There was little change over time in the overall frequency of diploids, triploids and aneuploids. Among aneuploids, oysters with 2n+3 and 3n-2 chromosomes were observed at Year 1, but absent at Year 4. Triploid progeny were significantly larger than diploids by 79% in whole body weight and 98% in meat weight at 4 years of age. Aneuploids were significantly smaller than normal diploids. This study suggests that triploid Pacific oyster is not completely sterile and cannot offer complete containment of cultured populations.

73349112220	Genetic linkage map of the pearl oyster, Pinctada martensii (Dunker)	Genetic linkage maps were constructed with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and microsatellite markers for the pearl oyster, Pinctada martensii (Dunker), the main bivalve used for marine pearl production in Asia. Twenty-four AFLP and 84 microsatellite primer pairs were used for linkage analysis in a full-sib family with two parents and 78 offspring. Of the 2357 AFLP fragments generated, 394 (16.7%) were polymorphic and segregating. Most (340 or 86.2%) of the markers segregated according to expected Mendelian ratios. Female and male linkage maps were constructed using 230 and 189 markers, including 15 and 10 microsatellites respectively. The female map consisted of 110 markers in 15 linkage groups, covering 1415.9 cM, with an average interval of 14.9 cM. The male map consisted of 98 markers in 16 linkage groups, with a total length of 1323.2 cM and an average interval of 16.1 cM. When unlinked doublets were considered, genome coverages were 78.5% for the female and 73.5% for the male map. Although preliminary, the genetic maps constructed here should be useful for future linkage and quantitative trait loci mapping efforts. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Genetic and genomic studies in this species require a large set of genetic markers. In this study, microsatellite markers were developed from an enriched DNA library. Five hundred sixty-seven clones were sequenced, producing 337 microsatellite-containing sequences with di- (82.0%), tri- (7.8%), tetra- (7.8%), hexa- (1.1 %), hepata- (1.1%), and octanucleotide (0.2%) repeats. Sixty primer pairs were designed and screened in 24 clams from a wild population, of which 30 primer pairs showed good amplification and produced no more than 2 alleles per individual. The other 30 primer pairs either failed to amplify consistently or amplified multiple fragments. Of the 30 primer pairs with good amplification, 29 were polymorphic with allele numbers ranging from 3-21 per locus. The expected and observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.53810.9628 and from 0.0417 0.9167, respectively. Fourteen of the 29 loci showed significant (P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction) deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, probably because of the presence of null alleles. Most of the microsatellite markers developed here should be useful for genome mapping and some for population genetics studies in this species.

77957369339	A 16-microsatellite multiplex assay for parentage assignment in the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin)	We tested a high level multiplex PCR for efficient microsatellite genotyping in the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). Sixteen microsatellites were selected based on polymorphism, allele size range, and reliability. They were divided into four groups according to their allele sizes and labeled with four different fluorescence dyes, so that loci in the same color did not overlap in size. A multiplex PCR protocol with eight levels of primer concentrations and four phases of touchdown reactions was developed for simultaneous amplification of all 16 loci and subsequent genotyping on a genetic analyzer. One hundred sixty progeny from a putative pool of 81 full-sib families were successfully genotyped at all 16 loci after one PCR, and all were unambiguously assigned to their perspective families. Our results show that high level multiplexing of 16 microsatellites is possible and can be used for rapid and highly efficient parentage assignment in the eastern oyster. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Sikamea	To understand possible reproductive interaction between Crassostrea ariakensis (Fujita, 1913) and C. sikamea (Amemiya, 1928), which coexist in estuaries of China and Japan, we conducted 2 × 2 factorial crosses between the two species. Asymmetry in fertilization success was observed, where C. sikamea eggs can be fertilized by C. ariakensis sperm, and the reciprocal cross resulted in no fertilization. Fertilization success in C. sikamea female × C. ariakensis male (SA) crosses was lower than that in the two intraspecific crosses and produced larvae that had similar growth rate as their maternal species during the first nine days because of maternal effects. After that, genome incompatibility casted negative effects on the growth and survival of the hybrid larvae. Most hybrid larvae died during metamorphosis, but a small number of spat survived. Genetic analysis revealed that the survived SA spat contained DNA from both species and were true hybrids. This study demonstrates that hybridization between C. ariakensis and C. sikamea is possible in one direction.

78650547821	Unusual conservation of mitochondrial gene order in Crassostrea oysters: Evidence for recent speciation in Asia	Background. Oysters are morphologically plastic and hence difficult subjects for taxonomic and evolutionary studies. It is long been suspected, based on the extraordinary species diversity observed, that Asia Pacific is the epicenter of oyster speciation. To understand the species diversity and its evolutionary history, we collected five Crassostrea species from Asia and sequenced their complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes in addition to two newly released Asian oysters (C. iredalei and Saccostrea mordax) for a comprehensive analysis. Results. The six Asian Crassostrea mt genomes ranged from 18,226 to 22,446 bp in size, and all coded for 39 genes (12 proteins, 2 rRNAs and 25 tRNAs) on the same strand. Their genomes contained a split of the rrnL gene and duplication of trnM, trnK and trnQ genes. They shared the same gene order that differed from an Atlantic sister species by as many as nine tRNA changes (6 transpositions and 3 duplications) and even differed significantly from S. mordax in protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the six Asian Crassostrea species emerged between 3 and 43 Myr ago, while the Atlantic species evolved 83 Myr ago. Conclusions. The complete conservation of gene order in the six Asian Crassostrea species over 43 Myr is highly unusual given the remarkable rate of rearrangements in their sister species and other bivalves. It provides strong evidence for the recent speciation of the six Crassostrea species in Asia. It further indicates that changes in mt gene order may not be strictly a function of time but subject to other constraints that are presently not well understood. © 2010 Ren et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

79551703009	Classification of a common cupped oyster from Southern China	To resolve the taxonomic status of a small cupped oyster from southern China, we collected and sequenced oysters from 20 sites in China along with sister species from other parts of the world. A total of 187 oysters were sequenced for 2 fragments belonging to the mitochondrial 16S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) genes. Sequence analyses of both gene fragments indicate that the small cupped oyster from southern China is the same species as Crassostrea angulata from Portugal. C. angulata has a wide distribution in southern China, ranging from Zhejiang to Hainan, with the Yangtze River separating it from Crassostrea gigas in northern China. The wide distribution and high gene diversity in China support the suggestion of a historical transfer of C. angulata from China to Europe. Sequence divergence between C. angulata and C. gigas, 1.05-1.32% in 16S and 2.22-3.37% in COI, is higher than that between the most divergent populations of a Crassostrea species (C. virginica, 0.51% in 16S and 2.04-2.22% in COI), but considerably lower than that observed between two closely related sister species (2.11-2.37% in 16S and 9.32-10.11 % in COI, between C. gigas and Crassostrea sikamea). This finding and the fact that the two oysters live in the same region with slightly different biological characters but can hybridize without any difficulties suggest that C. angulata should be considered a subspecies of C. gigas. .

79952193105	Polymorphism in a serine protease inhibitor gene and its association with disease resistance in the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin)	Serine protease inhibitors (SPIs) are a superfamily of structurally related but functionally diverse proteins found in almost all organisms ranging from viruses to humans. Some of them play important roles in host defense. A recently identified SPI from the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), cvSI-1, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of the Dermo pathogen Perkinsus marinus in vitro, although direct evidence linking it to disease resistance is lacking. In this study, we identified polymorphism in the cvSI-1 gene and studied its association with improved survival after disease-caused mortalities and in disease-resistant eastern oyster strains. Full-cDNA sequence of cvSI-1 was sequenced in a diverse panel of oysters, revealing 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 273 bp coding region: five were synonymous and seven non-synonymous. The Dn/Ds ratio, 1.4, suggests that cvSI-1 is under positive selection. Selected SNPs were genotyped in families before and after disease-caused mortalities as well as in disease-resistant and susceptible strains. At SNP198, the C allele consistently increased in frequency after mortalities that are caused primarily by Dermo and possibly also by MSX. Its frequency in the disease-resistant strain is significantly higher than that in the susceptible strains and the base population from which the selected strains were derived. These results indicate that polymorphism at cvSI-1 is associated with Dermo (possibly also MSX) resistance in the eastern oyster. SNP198 is a synonymous mutation, and its association with disease resistance may be due to its close linkage to a functional polymorphism nearby. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79955493292	Preliminary genetic linkage map of the abalone Haliotis diversicolor Reeve	Haliotis diversicolor Reeve is one of the most important mollusks cultured in South China. Preliminary genetic linkage maps were constructed with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A total of 2 596 AFLP markers were obtained from 28 primer combinations in two parents and 78 offsprings. Among them, 412 markers (15.9%) were polymorphic and segregated in the mapping family. Chi-square tests showed that 151 (84.4%) markers segregated according to the expected 1:1 Mendelian ratio (P<0.05) in the female parent, and 200 (85.8%) in the male parent. For the female map, 179 markers were used for linkage analysis and 90 markers were assigned to 17 linkage groups with an average interval length of 25.7 cm. For the male map, 233 markers were used and 94 were mapped into 18 linkage groups, with an average interval of 25.0 cm. The estimated genome length was 2 773.0 cm for the female and 2 817.1 cm for the male map. The observed length of the linkage map was 1 875.2 cm and 1 896.5 cm for the female and male maps, respectively.

79955527163	Development of Expressed Sequence Tags from the Pearl Oyster, Pinctada martensii Dunker	The pearl oyster, Pinctada martensii, is the primary species used for the aquaculture production of marine pearls in China and Japan. Genetic tools and resources are needed to study the genome of this species and to understand the molecular basis of development, growth, host defense, pearl formation, and other important traits. In this study, we developed a set of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for P. martensii. We constructed cDNA libraries from adult tissues and sequenced 7,128 ESTs. Clustering analysis identified 788 contigs (covering 5,769 ESTs) and 1,351 singletons, yielding a total of 2,139 unique genes. Of these unique genes, only 935 had significant (E-value ≤ 0.005) hits in GenBank, and the remaining 1,204 (56.3%) were novel. Most of the known genes are related to cellular structure, protein binding, and metabolic processes. Putative host-defense genes (86) were identified including C-type lectin, ferritin, polyubiquitin, proteases, protease inhibitors, scavenger receptors, heat shock proteins, and RAS oncogenes. The EST sequences developed in this study provide a valuable resource for future efforts on gene identification, marker development, and studies on molecular mechanism of host defense in pearl oysters. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

0035664551	A centromeric satellite sequence in the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas Thunberg) identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization	A highly repetitive satellite sequence was previously identified in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas Thunberg. The sequence has 168 bp per unit, present in tandem repeats, and accounts for 1% to 4% of the genome. We studied the chromosomal location of this satellite sequence by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). A probe was made by polymerase chain reaction and incorporation of digoxigenin-11-dUTP. Hybridization was detected with fluorescein-labeled antidigoxigenin antibodies. FISH signals were located at centromeric regions of 7 pairs of the Pacific oyster chromosomes. No interstitial site was found. Signals were strong and consistent on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, and 7, but weak or variable on chromosomes 5, 8, and 10. No signal was observed on chromosomes 3, 6, and 9. Our results showed that this sequence is clearly a centromeric satellite, disputing its previous assignment to the telomeric and submetacentric regions of 2 chromosomes. No signal was detected in the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin).

8444252193	Different responses to selection in two stocks of the bay scallop, Argopecten irradians irradians Lamarck (1819)	Two different stocks (A and B) of the bay scallop Argopecten irradians irradians (Lamarck, 1819) were used to test mass selection on growth. Stock A was a descending stock from the initial introduction from U.S.A. in 1982, which had been cultured in China for about 20 years. Stock B was the third generation from a recent introduction from U.S.A. in 1999. Truncation selection was conducted by selecting the largest 11% scallops in shell length from Stock A and the largest 12.7% scallops from Stock B as parents for the respective selected groups. Before the removal of parents for truncation selection, equal numbers of scallops were randomly chosen from Stock A and B to serve as parents for the control groups. Offspring from the four groups were reared under the same hatchery, nursery, and grow-out conditions. Values of response to selection and realized heritability at larvae, spat and grow-out stages for Stock B were all significantly (P<0.001) higher than its counterpart for Stock A. For Stock A, no significant response to selection was observed (P>0.05) at any stage, and the realized heritability for shell length was 0.015±0.024 for larvae, 0.040±0.027 for spat, and 0.080±0.009 for grow-out, respectively. For Stock B, however, significant (P<0.05) response to selection was observed, and the realized heritability for shell length was 0.511±0.010 for larvae, 0.341±0.022 for spat, and 0.338±0.015 for grow-out. On average, responses to selection at the three stages for Stock B was 30×, 7.1×, and 3× higher than its counterpart for Stock A, respectively. Accordingly, realized heritability at above stages for Stock B was 33×, 7.5×, and 3.2× higher than its counterpart for Stock A, respectively. Differences in response to selection and realized heritability between the two stocks are presumably due to differences in genetic variability. As the 20th generation from the initial introduction consisted of only 26 scallops, Stock A is known to be highly inbred, while inbreeding in Stock B is negligible. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

84859358254	Effects of salinity on larvae of the oysters Crassostrea ariakensis, C. sikamea and the hybrid cross	Crassostrea sikamea and C. ariakensis are two oysters from Asia that are sympatric and differ slightly in their environmental preference. They can hybridize in one direction, although the fertilization level and survival of hybrid larvae to spat are low. To understand the possible effects of salinity on cross-fertilization and the survival of hybrid larvae, we conducted hybridization experiments at four salinities (20, 25, 30 and 35 ppt). At all salinities, about 10% of C. sikamea eggs were fertilized by C. ariakensis sperm, while the reciprocal cross completely failed to fertilize. Survival of fertilized eggs to D-stage in the hybrid cross (C. sikamea female×C. ariakensis male, SA) was significantly (P&0.05) higher at 35 ppt than at lower salinities, while the effect of salinity was not significant in two pure-species crosses. High salinity negatively affected larval survival to day 7 in C. ariakensis and the hybrid cross. Larval growth in all groups was negatively correlated with salinity (P&0.01). Larval shell height at day 7 as well as daily increment was significantly smaller for hybrid than for purebred larvae (P&0.05). These results indicate that hybrid larvae prefer high salinity during the early stages of development but low salinity at later stages. The low and one-directional fertilization represents a pre-zygote barrier to hybridization, which may play a role in sympatric speciation. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84863217331	Mutation in promoter region of a serine protease inhibitor confers Perkinsus marinus resistance in the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica)	Protease inhibitors from the host may inhibit proteases from invading pathogens and confer resistance. We have previously shown that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP198C) in a serine protease inhibitor gene (. cvSI-1) is associated with Perkinsus marinus resistance in the eastern oyster. As SNP198 is synonymous, we studied whether its linkage to polymorphism at the promoter region could explain the resistance. A 631 bp fragment of the promoter region was cloned by genome-walking and resequenced, revealing 22 SNPs and 3 insertion/deletions (indels). A 25 bp indel at position -404 was genotyped along with SNP198 for association analysis using before- and after-mortality samples. After mortalities that were primarily caused by P. marinus, the frequency of deletion allele at -404indel increased by 15.6% (. p = 0.0437), while that of SNP198C increased by only 3.4% (. p = 0.5756). The resistance alleles at the two loci were coupled in 79.6% of the oysters. Oysters with the deletion allele at -404indel showed significant (. p = 0.0189) up-regulation of cvSI-1 expression under P. marinus challenge. Our results suggest that mutation at the promoter region causes increased transcription of cvSI-1, which in turn confers P. marinus resistance in the eastern oyster likely through inhibiting pathogenic proteases from the parasite. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

0038718474	Genetic linkage map of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica Gmelin	Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), along with some microsatellite and Type I markers, were used for linkage analysis in Crassostrea virginica Gmelin, the eastern oyster. Seventeen AFLP primer combinations were selected for linkage analysis with two parents and their 81 progeny. The 17 primer combinations produced 396 polymorphic markers, and 282 of them were segregating in the two parents. Chi-square analysis indicated that 259 (91.8%) markers segregated in Mendelian ratio, while the other 23 (8.2%) showed significant (P < 0.05) segregation distortion, primarily for homozygote deficiency and probably due to deleterious recessive genes. Moderately dense linkage maps were constructed using 158 and 133 segregating markers (including a few microsatellite and Type I markers) from male and female parents, respectively. The male framework map consisted of 114 markers in 12 linkage groups, covering 647 cM. The female map had 84 markers in 12 linkage groups with a length of 904 cM. The estimated genome length was 858 cM for the male map and 1296 cM for the female map. The observed genome coverage was 84% for the male and female map when all linked markers were considered. Genetic maps observed in this study are longer than the cytogenetic map, possibly because of low marker density.

84879264524	Regulation of a truncated isoform of AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) in response to hypoxia in the muscle of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas	AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) is a key regulator of energy balance in many model species during hypoxia. In a marine bivalve, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, we analyzed the protein content of adductor muscle in response to hypoxia during 6 h. In both smooth and striated muscles, the amount of full-length AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) remained unchanged during hypoxia. However, hypoxia induced a rapid and muscle-specific response concerning truncated isoforms of AMPKα. In the smooth muscle, a truncated isoform of AMPKα was increased from 1 to 6 h of hypoxia, and was linked with accumulation of AKT kinase, a key enzyme of the insulin signaling pathway which controls intracellular glucose metabolism. In this muscle, aerobic metabolism was maintained over the 6 h of hypoxia, as mitochondrial citrate synthase activity remained constant. In contrast, in striated muscle, hypoxia did not induce any significant modification of neither truncated AMPKα nor AKT protein content, and citrate synthase activity was altered after 6 h of hypoxia. Together, our results demonstrate that hypoxia response is specific to muscle type in Pacific oyster, and that truncated AMPKα and AKT proteins might be involved in maintaining aerobic metabolism in smooth muscle. Such regulation might occur in vivo during tidal intervals that cause up to 6 h of hypoxia. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84882979383	Structure and immune expression analysis of hemoglobin genes from the blood clam tegillarca granosa	Hemoglobin (Hb) is the major protein component of erythrocytes in animals with red blood, although it can serve additional functions beyond the transport of oxygen. The blood clam (Tegillarca granosa) is one of the few mollusks that has Hb, although the structure and function of molluskan Hbs remain unclear. We characterized two unique and highly compartmentalized blood clam hemoglobin genes, Tg-HbIIA and Tg-HbIIB, at the molecular level. The full-length cDNA of Tg-HbIIA was 731 bp with a 450-bp open reading frame encoding 150 amino acids; that of Tg-HbIIB was 698 bp, with a 456-bp open reading frame encoding 152 amino acids. Their intronic regions were amplified by PCR. The two genes showed the typical 2 intron/3 exon organization found in T. granosa. The 3-D structures of the three blood clam Tg-Hbs were predicted using the SWISS-MODEL Protein Modeling Server, and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted to investigate its evolution. As quantified by qRT-PCR, the expression levels of Tg-HbIIA and Tg-HbIIB were significantly upregulated upon challenge by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, lipopolysaccharides, and peptidoglycans. Three Hb isoforms, Tg-HbI, Tg-HbIIA, and Tg-HbIIB, were found. Specific structures and evolutionary features were found in these molluskan Hb genes. Challenge experiments indicated that Tg-Hbs are involved in immune defense responses against bacterial infection and bacterial pathogenic factors. As this is the first functional research on Hb genes in the blood clam, our findings provide new insight into the innate immune defense mechanisms of T. granosa. ©FUNPEC-RP.

84883376964	Occurrence and distribution of crassostrea sikamea (Amemiya 1928) in china	Cupped oysters are common and abundant along the coast of China, but their classification has been uncertain. In previous studies, we classified 2 of the cupped oysters into 2 subspecies: Crassostrea gigas gigas from the northern coast of China and Crassostrea gigas angulata from the southern coast of China. There is another small cupped oyster that seems different from these 2 species and resembles Crassostrea sikamea Amemiya 1928. To determine the taxonomic status of this oyster and its distribution, we collected wild oysters from 12 sites in China, identified putative C. sikamea with genetic markers, and compared them with known C. sikamea in both morphology and sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase I gene fragments. Sequence analyses confirm classification based on genetic markers that this small cupped oyster from China is indeed C. sikamea. Our data show that C. sikamea not only occurs naturally in China, but also lives in abundance over a wide geographical distribution, ranging from Jiangsu to Guangxi, including Hainan Island. Our findings greatly extend the known distribution range of this species, and the extended distribution follows the Kuroshio and Tsushima currents, suggesting that ocean currents may play a role in shaping oyster distribution. Knowing the distribution range of C. sikamea is important to our understanding of its evolutionary history as well as fishery management and aquaculture breeding of this commercially important species.

0042127128	Taxonomic status of four Crassostrea oysters from China as inferred from mitochondrial DNA sequences	It has been presumed that there are four common Crassostrea oyster species along the coast of China: the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), Zhe oyster (C. plicatula), Suminoe oyster (C. ariakensis), and Dalianwan oyster (C. talienwhanensis). Classification and species identification of these Crassostrea oysters have been difficult because of morphologic plasticity. In this article, phylogenetic analysis was performed to clarify taxonomic status of these species using mitochondrial DNA sequence data. Nucleotide sequences of a 443-bp fragment of ribosomal RNA gene and a 579-bp segment of cytochrome c oxidase I gene were obtained through sequencing and used for analysis. Genetic distances among the four species, using C. virginica as outgroup, were computed based on the sequence data, and phylogenetic trees for the five species were generated. The divergence between C. gigas and C. talienwhanensis was very low, as was that between C plicatula and C. ariakensis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that haplotypes of C. gigas and C. talienwhanensis clustered in one clade and those of C. plicatula and C. ariakensis in another one. Our data suggest that C. gigas and C. talienwhanensis may be the same species. However, the lack of divergence between C. plicatula and C. ariakensis samples may indicate that the C. plicatula specimen we sampled could actually be a morph of C. ariakensis living in high salinity habitats. More work is needed for confirmation.

84892901173	Transcriptome Analysis Reveals a Rich Gene Set Related to Innate Immunity in the Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica)	As a benthic filter-feeder of estuaries, the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, faces tremendous exposure to microbial pathogens. How eastern oysters without adaptive immunity survive in pathogen-rich environments is of fundamental interest, but studies on its immune system are hindered by the lack of genomic resources. We sequenced the transcriptome of an adult oyster with short Illumina reads and assembled 66,229 contigs with a N50 length of 1,503 bp. The assembly covered 89.4 % of published ESTs and 97.9 % of mitochondrial genes demonstrating its quality. A set of 39,978 contigs and unigenes (>300 bp) were identified and annotated by searching public databases. Analysis of the gene set yielded a diverse set of 657 genes related to innate immunity, including many pertaining to pattern recognition, effectors, signal transduction, cytokines, and apoptosis. Gene families encoding C1q domain containing proteins, CTLD, IAPs, Ig_I-set, and TRAFs expanded in C. virginica and Crassostrea gigas. Many key genes of the apoptosis system including IAP, BAX, BAC-2, caspase, FADD, and TNFR were identified, suggesting C. virginica posses advanced apoptosis and apoptosis-regulating systems. Our results show that short Illumina reads can produce transcriptomes of highly polymorphic genomes with coverage and integrity comparable to that from longer 454 reads. The expansion and high diversity in gene families related to innate immunity, point to a complex defense system in the lophotrochozoan C. virginica, probably in adaptation to a pathogen-rich environment. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84910680573	Genomic analysis of the pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) reveals possible conservation of vertebrate sex determination in a mollusc	Despite the prevalence of sex in animal kingdom, we have only limited understanding of how sex is determined and evolved in many taxa. The mollusc Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas exhibits complex modes of sexual reproduction that consists of protandric dioecy, sex change, and occasional hermaphroditism. This complex system is controlled by both environmental and genetic factors through unknown molecular mechanisms. In this study, we investigated genes related to sex-determining pathways in C. gigas through transcriptome sequencing and analysis of female and male gonads. Our analysis identified or confirmed novel homologs in the oyster of key sex-determining genes (SoxH or Sry-like and FoxL2) that were thought to be vertebrate-specific. Their expression profile in C. gigas is consistent with conserved roles in sex determination, under a proposed model where a novel testis-determining CgSoxH may serve as a primary regulator, directly or indirectly interacting with a testis-promoting CgDsx and an ovary-promoting CgFoxL2. Our findings plus previous results suggest that key vertebrate sex-determining genes such as Sry and FoxL2 may not be inventions of vertebrates. The presence of such genes in a mollusc with expression profiles consistent with expected roles in sex determination suggest that sex determination may be deeply conserved in animals, despite rapid evolution of the regulatory pathways that in C. gigas may involve both genetic and environmental factors.

11144228680	Chromosomal rearrangement in pectinidae revealed by rRNA loci and implications for bivalve evolution	Karyotype and chromosomal localization of major (18-5.8-28S) and minor (5S) ribosomal RNA genes were studied in two species of Pectinidae, zhikong (Chlamys farreri) and bay (Argopecten irradians irradians) scallops, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). C. farreri had a haploid number of 19 with a karyotype of 3m + 4sm + 7sm-st + 4st + 1st-t, and A. i. irradians had a haploid number of 16 with a karyotype of 5st + 11t. In C. farreri, the major and minor rRNA genes had one locus each and were mapped to the same chromosome - Chromosome 5. In A. i. irradians, the major rRNA genes had two loci, located on Chromosomes 4 and 8, and the 5S rRNA gene was found at a third chromosome - Chromosome 10. Results of this and other studies indicate that karyotype of A. i. irradians (n = 16, 21 arms) is secondary and derived from an ancestral karyotype similar to that of C. farreri (n = 19, 38 arms) through considerable chromosomal loss and rearrangements. The ability to tolerate significant chromosomal loss suggests that the modal karyotype of Pectinidae and possibly other bivalves with a haploid number of 19 is likely tetraploid; i.e., at least one genome duplication has occurred during the evolution of Bivalvia.

1242321379	Differences in the rDNA-Bearing Chromosome Divide the Asian-Pacific and Atlantic Species of Crassostrea (Bivalvia, Mollusca)	Karyotype and chromosomal location of the major ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) were studied using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in five species of Crassostrea: three Asian-Pacific species (C. gigas, C. plicatula, and C. ariakemis) and two Atlantic species (C. virginica and C. rhizophorae). FISH probes were made by PCR amplification of the intergenic transcribed spacer between the 18S and 5.8S rRNA genes, and labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP. All five species had a haploid number of 10 chromosomes. The Atlantic species had 1-2 submetacentric chromosomes, while the three Pacific species had none. FISH with metaphase chromosomes detected a single telomeric locus for rDNA in all five species without any variation. In all three Pacific species, rDNA was located on the long arm of Chromosome 10 (10q) - the smallest chromosome. In the two Atlantic species, rDNA was located on the short arm of Chromosome 2 (2p) - the second longest chromosome. A review of other studies reveals the same distribution of NOR sites (putative rDNA loci) in three other species: on 10q in C. sikamea and C. angulata from the Pacific Ocean and on 2p in C. gasar from the western Atlantic. All data support the conclusion that differences in size and shape of the rDNA-bearing chromosome represent a major divide between Asian-Pacific and Atlantic species of Crassostrea. This finding suggests that chromosomal divergence can occur under seemingly conserved karyotypes and may play a role in reproductive isolation and speciation.
