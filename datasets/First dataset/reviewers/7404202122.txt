Simultaneously, the electrochemical properties of corresponding zinc electrodes are also studied through potentiodynamic polarization and cyclic voltammetry. Results demonstrate that the distribution features of neodymium conversion layers are changed by adjusting ultrasonic time and irradiation power, which contributes to different enhancement extents for the electrochemical performance of zinc electrodes. Especially, the neodymium conversion coatings generated by ultrasonic impregnation at an ultrasonic power of 550 W for an irradiation time of 10 min play a very efficient role in obtaining fine corrosion resistance and persistent cycle behavior of zinc electrode. Besides, ultrasonic impregnation is verified to have a great advantage, as compared with simple impregnation, because the neodymium conversion layers formed under the action of ultrasonic agitation and cavitation phenomenon can obviously improve the electrochemical performance of zinc electrodes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Microcapsules-silicone coatings of atomic oxygen (AO) resistant was prepared by Czochralski method on the surface of Kapton. The erosion behaviors of Kapton without and with microcapsules-silicone coatings were studied during exposure in AO environment in ground-based simulation facilities. The results indicate that the Kapton undergoes dramatical degradation with an obvious mass loss and change of surface morphologies. The optical properties of Kapton also significantly degenerate with a solar absorption rate changing of 0.272 before and after AO exposure. The microcapsules-silicone coatings posses a good performance on the AO resistant with less mass loss and erosion rate and the Δα is only 0.071.

Polyimide with and without nano-ZnO/silicone coating was exposed to atomic oxygen (AO) in a ground-based AO effect simulation facility. The modified nano-ZnO particles were uniformly distributed within the silicone coating so that micro-cracks occurred during film-forming of the silicone were eliminated effectively. The AO experiment results indicate that polyimide is significantly eroded which is characterized by substantial weight loss and change of surface morphologies; nano-ZnO/silicone coatings exhibit excellent properties for anti-atomic oxygen effects with little variation in weight or morphology.

In this paper, four kinds of sol film were prepared on titanium alloys with and without anodic oxidation film. The prepared sol included Al2O3, Al2O3-ZrO2 and doped sol by adding additive into them respectively. The film thickness, high temperature oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance after high temperature oxidation for some time were investigated. The results show that the sol film obtained on the anodic oxidation film of titanium alloys is thicker than that without anodic oxidation film. Compared with the other three kinds of film, the doped Al2O3-ZrO2 sol film has the best high temperature oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance due to insulation effect of the sol film, and the composition of additive and zirconic. © (2009) Trans Tech Publications.

The microstructure of the electroformed copper layer was observed by using an optical microscope (OM) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The preferred orientations of the layer were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The mechanical properties were evaluated with a Vicker's hardness tester and a tensile tester. It is found the gradient microstructure consists of two main parts: the outer part (faraway substrate) with columnar crystals and the inner part (nearby substrate) with equiaxed grains. The Cu-(220) preferred orientation increases with the increasing thickness of the copper layer. The test results show that the microhardness of the electroformed copper layer decreases with increasing grain size along the growth direction and presents a gradient distribution. The tensile strength of the outer part of the electroformed copper layer is higher than that of the inner part but at the cost of ductility. Meanwhile, the integral mechanical properties of the electroformed copper with gradient microstructure are significantly improved in comparison with the pure copper deposit. © University of Science and Technology Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersion spectrum (EDS) were used to analyze the microstructure and components of modified CIP. Electromagnetic parameters of modified CIP and reflectivity losses of multi-layer fabric coated absorbing material were measured by a 3 cm waveguide system. The results showed that copper particles were successfully deposited on the surface of CIP.

After submicron diamonds were added to the electrolyte, the shape of copper grains transformed from oval or round to polyhedron, the growth mode of copper grains transformed from columnar growth to gradual change in size, and the preferred orientation of copper grains transformed from (220) to (200). Analyzing the variation of cathodic overpotential, it was found that the cathodic overpotential tended to remain unchanged when copper plane (220) grew in the process of electrodepositing pure copper, while it tended to decrease with time when copper plane (200) grew in the process of co-deposition. It was inferred that copper plane (200) was propitious to the deposition of submicron diamonds. © University of Science and Technology Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

84861941568	Study on corrosion behavior of 30CrMnSiNi2A steels in simulated tank water environment	The environmental conditions of aircraft tank water was simulated to study the corrosion behavior and characteristic of 30CrMnSiNi2A steel by corrosion area, corrosion mass loss rate, content of dissolved oxygen and pH in simulated tank water, corrosion potential of high-strength steel and so on. The results indicated that the corrosion process of 30CrMnSiNi2A steel in the simulated tank water was divided into three states: rapid corrosion stage came from 0h to 24h in which corrosion area was small and corrosion rate was fast; medium corrosion stage came from 24h to 168h in which most of the area was corroded and corrosion rate slowed down; slow corrosion stage came from 168h to 480h in which all of the area was corroded and corrosion rate was slow. With time going on, content of dissolved oxygen gradually reduced at first and then kept steady; pH value rapidly increased at first and then fluctuated within a narrow range; corrosion potential changed as decreasing exponential function. In addition, EIS and Tafel polarization curves indicated that corrosion rate of 30CrMnSiNi2A steel at three characteristic pH(4.2, 4.8, 5.2) decreased with pH value increasing.

In this letter, an excellent non-wax-stick coating was prepared based on Zn coating by chemical conversion treatment. The chemical conversion coating had hydrophilic and superoleophobic properties in water/oil mixture system, which enabled it to trap water molecules on the surface and reduce wax deposition. The coating was mainly composed of Zn and O elements accompanied by some Si element, and the costing surface showed round bulge structure with different sizes. The combination of chemical composition and structure was considered to play the key role in the special liquid wettability and non-wax-stick properties. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Under light illumination, excitons were generated in the CdS QDs and dissociated in the ZnO/CdS interface. Photoelectrochemical characterization indicates that fiber quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) could effectively absorb visible light and convert it to electric energy. The photoelectrochemical performance was enhanced after the deposition of a ZnS passivating layer on the CF/ZnO/CdS surface. The highest conversion efficiency of about 0.006% was achieved by the fiber QDSCs. A higher conversion efficiency was expected to be achieved after some important parameters and cell structure were optimized and improved. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84864381544	Study of the restoration behavior of breakage of different coatings on the surface of steel by a hydrophobic agent	Surface coatings of aircraft components can possibly be broken and scratched during assembly and transportation, and gap junctions of some fitting parts are channels of corrosion medium's erosion and sensitive areas of corrosion. The restoration behaviors of the hydrophobic agent (BH-102) used in aircraft components for the breakages of three basic coatings (the epoxy silicone coating, the polyurethane coating and the AV15 coating) are investigated. Furthermore, the corrosion properties of coatings after restoration are also researched under the neutral salt spray environment and the hydrothermal environment. Results are presented that hydrophobic layer which can effectively prevent corrosion at coating breakage areas formed on the restoration areas of basic coatings. The restoration effect (anti-corrosion property) on the AV15 coating breakage is better than the other two coating-breakages by the hydrophobic agent, and that is because the hydrophobic agent can cause synergistic effect with the film formers and the inhibitor components of AV15 coating.

Structure and thermal stability of the hydrophobic powder were characterized by FTIR and TG/DSC, respectively. Hydrophobic property and corrosion resistance of the hydrophobic film formed on phosphatized steel by immersion in 3 wt% NaCl aqueous solution were evaluated together with the electrochemical behavior. Results showed that the skeleton of the hydrophobic powder was composed mainly of SiOSi which comprises longer and more hydrophobic groups of SiR compared with the conventional BH-102 water-repellent agent. A thin hydrophobic film with a thickness of 15-20 μm was formed on surface of the phosphatized steel after immersion in the solution of 5 g/L of the hydrophobic powder in ethanol for 5 min. The hydrophobic film exhibited excellent stability at a temperature below 135 °C. Water contact angle on the film is about 117-132° and it was until 30 h later when a corrosion spot occurred on the film covered on steel which revealed better water-repellent and corrosion resistant properties compared to that of the BH-102. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84874588700	ITO porous film-supported metal sulfide counter electrodes for high-performance quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells	In this paper, ITO porous films were prepared by the doctor-blade technique to support metal sulfide (CuS, CoS, NiS, and PbS) counter electrodes (CEs) in quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). The successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method was used to deposit metal sulfides on the ITO porous films. Since the ITO porous films have high mechanical properties and could offer a large surface area for the large deposition of metal sulfides, the ITO porous film-supported metal sulfide CEs exhibited much higher catalytic activity for polysulfide electrolyte than ITO glass-supported metal sulfide CEs. As a result, the photoeletrochemical performance of QDSCs was greatly improved. In addition, ITO porous film-supported CuS CEs at 12 SILAR cycles exhibited the highest catalytic activity and performance among different CEs, and ITO porous film-supported CoS CEs achieved the second highest catalytic activity and performance, still far higher than the Pt CE, while both ITO porous film-supported NiS and PbS CEs showed similar catalytic activity and performance, significantly lower than that of Pt CE. It is also suggested that many more CE materials can be easily explored and investigated by employing ITO porous films as substrates. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

The nanosheets were first electrodeposited by controlling the concentration of potassium acetate (KAc) in nitrate electrolyte. The effects of KAc concentration on the electrochemical behavior, the composition and morphology of samples were further discussed. It was indicated that the as-deposited nanosheets were a mixture of ZnO and zinc acetate hydroxide hydrate (ZAHH). After annealing at 450 °C for 30 min, ZnO/ZAHH nanosheets with smooth surfaces were converted to pure ZnO nanosheets with porous structure, which were oblong in shape, ultra-thin (about 20 nm in thickness) and constructed with well-distributed single-layer ZnO nanoparticles with the size of 30-60 nm. As preliminary application in quantum dots-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs), porous ZnO nanosheets were co-sensitized with CdS and CdSe QDs and the QDSCs based on porous ZnO nanosheets deposited for 15 min achieved a high efficiency of 2.67%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84875266454	Corrosion behavior of 2A12 aluminum alloy in neutral salt spray environment with different Al-clad removing processes	In the process of assembling and machining, the aluminum alloy components will directly expose to aggressive environment once Al-clad is destroyed. As such, it is meaningful to investigate the corrosion behavior of 2A12 aluminum alloy in neutral salt spray environment after removing Al-clad coating with different processes. In this work, the corrosion behaviors of the aluminum alloy were evaluated by the changes in morphology, composition, and maximum mean corrosion depth. The results show that the corrosion rate of 2A12 aluminum alloy was very high in the first 24 h, and then decreased with test duration. Among all the Al-clad removing processes, the one at higher temperature (90-100 °C) for shorter time (3-4 min) exhibit the best performance in the presence of inhibitor and sanding. The three possible reasons include effect of inhibitor adsorbing, role of sanding, impact of higher temperature, and shorter time. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

As corrosion time extends, both corrosion weight loss and damage area ratio increase, while the corrosion damage area ratio exhibits a trend of power function.

84877683912	Preparation of anti-wax coatings and their anti-wax property in crude oil	Anti-wax surface modification is a promising approach to reduce wax deposition in crude oil recovery. Seven alloy surfaces were prepared using thermal spraying method on carbon steel. The morphology and composition of these surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectroscopy. A wax deposition test device was designed to investigate the anti-wax property of different surfaces. The results show that the Zn-Fe and Zn-Ni-Fe alloy coatings can improve the anti-wax property of carbon steel surface to a certain extent but not significantly. The introduction of phosphorus was found leading to the formation of a special lamellar microstructure on the coating surface. The good anti-wax property may attribute to the lamellar surface structure and the elemental composition (Zn, Ni and P) of the coatings. Water content of the crude oil may also affect the anti-wax property. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84879118053	Rapid reversible superhydrophobicity-to-superhydrophilicity transition on alternating current etched brass	Reversible surface wetting behavior is a hot topic of research because of the potential engineering applications. In the present work, a hierarchical micro/nanostructure is fabricated on brass by alternate current (AC) etching. The superhydrophilic as-prepared etched brass (EB) turns into superhydrophobic after the modification of stearic acid for 1 min. After annealing at 350 C for 5 min, the superhydrophobic modified EB surface becomes superhydrophilic again. Furthermore, the annealed EB can restore the superhydrophobicity with the remodification of stearic acid. The wetting transition is realized by stearic acid modification and annealing rapidly in 6 min. The wetting transition mechanism is discussed based on the surface chemical analysis. This method is facile and suitable for the construction of large-scale and complex brass surfaces with tunable wetting behaviors. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

Effect of additive's concentration on the surface morphology, composition and corrosion resistance of aluminum-based conversion coating on magnesium alloys was studied.

The conversion coatings' morphologies first gradually became dense and the micro-cracks on the coating surface became narrow with the increase of the additive concentration. Then the coatings' morphologies became bad and the micro-cracks widened after the additive concentration reached 0.005 mol/L.

Atmospheric exposure, lamination and corrosion tests results show that steel, copper alloy and aluminum alloy treated with this solution exhibit excellent antirust property, which is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of different corrosion inhibitors in the solution. Phytic acid and compound inhibitor play a synergistic role in the formation of the compact and uniform adsorption-complextion film on steel surface. And the self-corrosion potential of steel shifts from -0.74 V to -0.08 V and the corrosion current is reduced evidently. In addition, the self-corrosion potentials of copper and aluminum alloys also increase obviously as the antirust treatment duration increases, which results in the improvement in antirust property.

The influence of temperature on the initial corrosion behavior of aluminum alloy 2A12 in a simulated tank water environment is studied by observing the corrosion morphology, maximum pitting corrosion depth, maximum pitting corrosion area, surface corrosion damage ratio, EIS, etc. The results indicate that pitting corrosion depth, pitting corrosion area and surface corrosion damage ratio increase with increasing temperature. In particular, at temperatures 65°C and 75°C, corrosion speed increases dramatically. In the simulated tank water of 25, 35, 45 and 55°C, the variation in maximum pitting corrosion depth and area with time all fit well withthe power function. At temperatures 65°C and 75°C, they both fit well with the least square polynomial fitting. In addition, EIS indicates that corrosion rate in simulated tank water of three typical temperatures (25, 55, 75°C) increases with temperature increase.

Distributions of elements in MAO coatings were investigated by energy dispersion X-ray spectrometry (EDS). The results showed that P and Si were layered in the MAO coating. The newly formed coating, P-rich layer, formed in the second step was located under the layer formed in the first step, which increased the coating's thickness. Discharge channels can be found in MAO coating by the distribution of P, which connect substrate and the outside of coating. The inner newly formed P-rich layer increased its thickness as the oxidation time increased. These results give some direct experimental evidences for the inward growth mechanism of MAO coatings and indicate that discharge channels are the main ways to form the new coating which lead to the inward growth of MAO coating. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The same weight of DFMA was added into the reaction through two different ways: (1) adding DFMA as bottom monomer (AFBM); (2) adding DFMA drop by drop (AFDD). The different coatings were prepared by blending the fluorine-modified acrylate resin with the curing agent. Compared with AFDD coating, the AFBM coating exhibited better self-cleaning ability which was confirmed by the self-cleaning test through measuring the specular gloss of coatings before contamination and after water droplets flushing. The fluorine content at the surface of AFBM coating increased from 15.1 at.% to 23.1 at.%, while the water contact angles increased by 8 and the sliding angles decreased obviously. Furthermore, the contact angles and self-cleaning ability of the coatings prepared with DFMA through two adding ways both decreased after scrubbing by wet cotton because of the decrease of the surface fluorine atom content. It could be concluded that high contact angles and low sliding angles were advantageous for coatings to obtain excellent self-cleaning ability. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The reaction process was divided into four stages; the shape, thickness, surface roughness and the elemental composition of the coating formed in these stages were analyzed. The reasons why the surface roughness of the coating changed were discussed on the basis of the spark status at each stage. The results are shown as follows: in the stage without the spark, the surface roughness of the coating was influenced greatly by the matrix; in the stage with the white small spark, a compact oxide coating formed and the surface roughness decreased gradually; in the stage with the yellow small spark, the growth rate of the coating increased and oxide gathered on the coating surface and formed a volcano-like bulge. For this reason, the surface roughness began to increase. When the MAO reaction moved into the orange big spark stage, more volcano-like bulges appeared. In addition, the surface roughness of the coating increased quickly.

The results reveal that water-repellent performance of hydrophobic films exposed in outdoor decreases much faster than that in indoor films, whose contact angles are still above 100° after 115 days exposure, while films' contact angles are only about 50° in the environment of outdoor. The results of FTIR spectra indicate that long chain structure of the Si-O-Si and Si-H bond of hydrophobic films are destroyed in outdoor. Furthermore, properties of the water-repellent and the flowing of hydrophobic films based in carbon steel and aluminum alloy substrate in simulated condensation water show different trends apparently, however the molecule structure of both do not change evidently. According to the AFM results, one of the reasons that cause the decline of water-repellent performance is the diminution of the roughness of hydrophobic films themselves in simulated condensation water.
