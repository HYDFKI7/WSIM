33646375715	Double-hadron leptoproduction in the nuclear medium	The first measurements of double-hadron production in deep-inelastic scattering within the nuclear medium were made with the HERMES spectrometer at DESY HERA using a 27.6 GeV positron beam. By comparing data for deuterium, nitrogen, krypton, and xenon nuclei, the influence of the nuclear medium on the ratio of double-hadron to single-hadron yields was investigated. Nuclear effects on the additional hadron are clearly observed, but with little or no difference among nitrogen, krypton, or xenon, and with smaller magnitude than effects seen on previously measured single-hadron multiplicities. The data are compared with models based on partonic energy loss or prehadronic scattering and with a model based on a purely absorptive treatment of the final-state interactions. Thus, the double-hadron ratio provides an additional tool for studying modifications of hadronization in nuclear matter. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33846520040	Beam-charge azimuthal asymmetry and deeply virtual Compton scattering	The first observation of an azimuthal cross section asymmetry with respect to the charge of the incoming lepton beam is reported from a study of hard exclusive electroproduction of real photons. The data have been accumulated by the HERMES experiment at DESY, in which the HERA 27.6 GeV electron or positron beam scattered off an unpolarized hydrogen gas target. The observed asymmetry is attributed to the interference between the Bethe-Heitler process and the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) process. The interference term is sensitive to DVCS amplitudes, which provide the most direct access to generalized parton distributions. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

80052964372	Measurement of double-spin asymmetries associated with deeply virtual Compton scattering on a transversely polarized hydrogen target	Double-spin asymmetries in exclusive electroproduction of real photons from a transversely polarized hydrogen target are measured with respect to the product of target polarization with beam helicity and beam charge, and with respect to the product of target polarization with beam helicity alone. The asymmetries arise from the deeply virtual Compton scattering process and its interference with the Bethe-Heitler process. They are related to the real part of the same combination of Compton form factors as that determining the previously published transverse target single-spin asymmetries through the imaginary part. The results for the double-spin asymmetries are found to be compatible with zero within the uncertainties of the measurement, and are not incompatible with the predictions of the only available GPD-based calculation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84908191338	Azimuthal anisotropy of D -meson production in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN =2.76 TeV	The production of the prompt charmed mesons D0, D+, and D∗+ relative to the reaction plane was measured in Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision of sNN=2.76TeV with the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. D mesons were reconstructed via their hadronic decays at central rapidity in the transverse-momentum (pT) interval 2-16 GeV/c. The azimuthal anisotropy is quantified in terms of the second coefficient v2 in a Fourier expansion of the D-meson azimuthal distribution and in terms of the nuclear modification factor RAA, measured in the direction of the reaction plane and orthogonal to it. The v2 coefficient was measured with three different methods and in three centrality classes in the interval 0%-50%. A positive v2 is observed in midcentral collisions (30%-50% centrality class), with a mean value of 0.204-0.036+0.099 (tot. unc.) in the interval 2<pT<6GeV/c, which decreases towards more central collisions (10%-30% and 0%-10% classes). The positive v2 is also reflected in the nuclear modification factor, which shows a stronger suppression in the direction orthogonal to the reaction plane for midcentral collisions. The measurements are compared to theoretical calculations of charm-quark transport and energy loss in high-density strongly interacting matter at high temperature. The models that include substantial elastic interactions with an expanding medium provide a good description of the observed anisotropy. However, they are challenged to simultaneously describe the strong suppression of high-pT yield of D mesons in central collisions and their azimuthal anisotropy in noncentral collisions.

4544369185	Hard exclusive electroproduction of π	Hard exclusive electroproduction of π+π- pairs off hydrogen and deuterium targets has been studied by the HERMES experiment at DESY. Legendre moments 〈P1〉 and 〈P3〉 of the angular distributions of π+ mesons in the center-of-mass frame of the pair have been measured for the first time. Their dependence on the π+π- invariant mass can be understood as being due to the interference between relative P-wave (isovector) and S-, D-wave (isoscalar) states of the two pions. The increase in magnitude of 〈P1〉 as Bjorken x increases is interpreted in the framework of generalized parton distributions as an enhancement of flavour non-singlet qq̄ exchange for larger values of x, which leads to a sizable admixture of isoscalar and isovector pion pairs. In addition, the interference between P-wave and D-wave states separately for transverse and longitudinal pion pairs has been studied. The data indicate that in the f2(1270) region at 〈Q2〉=3 GeV2 higher-twist effects can be as large as the leading-twist longitudinal component. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

From the same data set on a hydrogen target, new results for the beam-charge asymmetry are also extracted with better precision than those previously reported. By comparing model calculations with measured asymmetries attributed to the interference between the deeply virtual Compton scattering and Bethe-Heitler processes, a model-dependent constraint is obtained on the total angular momenta carried by up and down quarks in the nucleon.

It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors.

Although the proton intensity was very low, with only one pilot bunch per beam, and no systematic attempt was made to optimize the collision optics, all LHC experiments reported a number of collision candidates. In the ALICE experiment, the collision region was centred very well in both the longitudinal and transverse directions and 284 events were recorded in coincidence with the two passing proton bunches. The events were immediately reconstructed and analyzed both online and offline. We have used these events to measure the pseudorapidity density of charged primary particles in the central region.

The observed beam-charge and beam-helicity asymmetries are attributed to the interference between the Bethe-Heitler and the deeply virtual Compton scattering processes. For various nuclei, the asymmetries are extracted for both coherent and incoherent-enriched regions, which involve different (combinations of) generalized parton distributions.

The dependence of the cross section on the azimuthal angles of the target polarization (ΦS) and the produced hadron (Φ) is found to have a substantial sin(Φ+ΦS) modulation for the production of π+, π- and K+. This Fourier component can be interpreted in terms of non-zero transversity distribution functions and non-zero favored and disfavored Collins fragmentation functions with opposite sign. For π0 and K- production the amplitude of this Fourier component is consistent with zero. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77957967996	Measurement of azimuthal asymmetries associated with deeply virtual Compton scattering on a longitudinally polarized deuterium target	Azimuthal asymmetries in exclusive electroproduction of a real photon from a longitudinally polarized deuterium target are measured with respect to target polarization alone and with respect to target polarization combined with beam helicity and/or beam charge. The asymmetries appear in the distribution of the real photons in the azimuthal angle around the virtual photon direction, relative to the lepton scattering plane. The asymmetries arise from the deeply virtual Compton scattering process and its interference with the Bethe-Heitler process. The results for the beam-charge and beam-helicity asymmetries from a tensor polarized deuterium target with vanishing vector polarization are shown to be compatible with those from an unpolarized deuterium target, which is expected for incoherent scattering dominant at larger momentum transfer. Furthermore, the results for the single target-spin asymmetry and for the double-spin asymmetry are found to be compatible with the corresponding asymmetries previously measured on a hydrogen target. For coherent scattering on the deuteron at small momentum transfer to the target, these findings imply that the tensor contribution to the cross section is small. Furthermore, the tensor asymmetry is found to be compatible with zero. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

78650597800	Suppression of charged particle production at large transverse momentum in central Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV	Inclusive transverse momentum spectra of primary charged particles in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV have been measured by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. The data are presented for central and peripheral collisions, corresponding to 0-5% and 70-80% of the hadronic Pb-Pb cross section. The measured charged particle spectra in |n|<0.8 and 0.3<pT<20 GeV/c are compared to the expectation in pp collisions at the same sNN, scaled by the number of underlying nucleon-nucleon collisions. The comparison is expressed in terms of the nuclear modification factor RAA. The result indicates only weak medium effects (RAA≈0.7) in peripheral collisions. In central collisions, RAA reaches a minimum of about 0.14 at pT=6-7 GeV/c and increases significantly at larger pT. The measured suppression of high- pT particles is stronger than that observed at lower collision energies, indicating that a very dense medium is formed in central Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. © 2010 CERN.

The correlation functions as well as the extracted source radii scale with event multiplicity and pair momentum. When analyzed in the same multiplicity and pair transverse momentum range, the correlation is similar at the two collision energies. A three-dimensional femtoscopic analysis shows an increase of the emission zone with increasing event multiplicity as well as decreasing homogeneity lengths with increasing transverse momentum. The latter trend gets more pronounced as multiplicity increases. This suggests the development of space-momentum correlations, at least for collisions producing a high multiplicity of particles. We consider these trends in the context of previous femtoscopic studies in high-energy hadron and heavy-ion collisions and discuss possible underlying physics mechanisms. Detailed analysis of the correlation reveals an exponential shape in the outward and longitudinal directions, while the sideward remains a Gaussian. This is interpreted as a result of a significant contribution of strongly decaying resonances to the emission region shape. Significant nonfemtoscopic correlations are observed, and are argued to be the consequence of "mini-jet"-like structures extending to low p

The asymmetry arises from deeply virtual Compton scattering and its interference with the Bethe-Heitler process. Azimuthal amplitudes of the beam-helicity asymmetry are extracted from a data sample consisting of ep → epγ events with detection of all particles in the final state including the recoiling proton. The installation of a recoil detector, while reducing the acceptance of the experiment, allows the elimination of background from ep → eNπγ events, which was estimated to contribute an average of about 12% to the signal in previous Hermes publications. The removal of this background from the present data sample is shown to increase the magnitude of the leading asymmetry amplitude by 0:054 ± 0:016 to - 0:328 ± 0:027 (stat:) ± 0:045 (syst:).

Particle identification is performed using the specific energy loss in the inner tracking silicon detector and the time projection chamber. In addition, time-of-flight information is used to identify hadrons at higher momenta. Finally, the distinctive kink topology of the weak decay of charged kaons is used for an alternative measurement of the kaon transverse momentum (pt) spectra. Since these various particle identification tools give the best separation capabilities over different momentum ranges, the results are combined to extract spectra from pt = 100 MeV/c to 2.5 GeV/c. The measured spectra are further compared with QCD-inspired models which yield a poor description. The total yields and the mean pt are compared with previous measurements, and the trends as a function of collision energy are discussed.

One-dimensional KchKch correlation functions are constructed in three multiplicity and four transverse momentum ranges. The KchKch femtoscopic source parameters R and λ are extracted. The KchKch correlations show a slight increase of femtoscopic radii with increasing multiplicity and a slight decrease of radii with increasing transverse momentum. These trends are similar to the ones observed for ππ and Ks0Ks0 correlations in pp and heavy-ion collisions.

The centrality is a key parameter in the study of the properties of QCD matter at extreme temperature and energy density, because it is directly related to the initial overlap region of the colliding nuclei. Geometrical properties of the collision, such as the number of participating nucleons and the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, are deduced from a Glauber model with a sharp impact parameter selection and shown to be consistent with those extracted from the data.

In addition, such correlations can be used to search for the presence of a coherent component of pion production. Two- and three-pion correlations of same and mixed charge are measured at low relative momentum to estimate the coherent fraction of charged pions in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider with ALICE. The genuine three-pion quantum statistics correlation is found to be suppressed relative to the two-pion correlation based on the assumption of fully chaotic pion emission. The suppression is observed to decrease with triplet momentum. The observed suppression at low triplet momentum may correspond to a coherent fraction in charged-pion emission of 23%±8% © 2014 CERN, for the Alice Collaboration.

84899688069	Multi-strange baryon production at mid-rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at √s<inf>NN</inf>=2.76 TeV	The production of Ξ<sup>-</sup> and ω<sup>-</sup> baryons and their anti-particles in Pb-Pb collisions at √s<inf>NN</inf> = 2.76 TeV has been measured using the ALICE detector. The transverse momentum spectra at mid-rapidity (|y| < 0.5) for charged Ξ and ω hyperons have been studied in the range 0.6 < P<inf>T</inf> < 8.0 GeV/c and 1.2 < P<inf>T</inf> < 7.0 GeV/c, respectively, and in several centrality intervals (from the most central 0-10% to the most peripheral 60-80% collisions). These spectra have been compared with the predictions of recent hydrodynamic models. In particular, the Kraków and EPOS models give a satisfactory description of the data, with the latter covering a wider P<inf>T</inf> range. Mid-rapidity yields, integrated over P<inf>T</inf>, have been determined. The hyperon-to-pion ratios are similar to those at RHIC: they rise smoothly with centrality up to (N<inf>part</inf>) ~ 150 and saturate thereafter. The enhancements (yields per participant nucleon relative to those in pp collisions) increase both with the strangeness content of the baryon and with centrality, but are less pronounced than at lower energies. © 2013 The Authors.

84899766855	Transverse target single-spin asymmetry in inclusive electroproduction of charged pions and kaons	Single-spin asymmetries were investigated in inclusive electroproduction of charged pions and kaons from transversely polarized protons at the Hermes experiment. The asymmetries were studied as a function of the azimuthal angle ψ about the beam direction between the target-spin direction and the hadron production plane, the transverse hadron momentum P<inf>T</inf> relative to the direction of the incident beam, and the Feynman variable x<inf>F</inf>. The ψ sin amplitudes are positive for π<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, slightly negative forπ<sup>-</sup> and consistent with zero for K<sup>-</sup>, with particular P<inf>T</inf> but weak x<inf>F</inf> dependences. Especially large asymmetries are observed for two small subsamples of events, where also the scattered electron was recorded by the spectrometer. © 2013 The Authors.

84899946338	Strange particle production in proton–proton collisions at √s = 0.9 TeV with ALICE at the LHC	The production of mesons containing strange quarks (K<sup>0</sup> <inf>S</inf>, ϕ) and both singly and doubly strange baryons (⋀, ⊼, and Ξ<sup>−</sup> +Ξ<sup>+</sup>) are measured at mid-rapidity in pp collisions at √s = 0.9 TeV with the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The results are obtained from the analysis of about 250 k minimum bias events recorded in 2009. Measurements of yields (dN/dy) and transverse momentum spectra at mid-rapidity for inelastic pp collisions are presented. For mesons, we report yields (〈dN/dy〉) of 0.184 ± 0.002(stat.) ± 0.006(syst.) for K<sup>0</sup> <inf>S</inf> and 0.021 ± 0.004(stat.) ± 0.003(syst.) for ϕ. For baryons, we find 〈dN/dy〉 = 0.048 ± 0.001(stat.) ± 0.004(syst.) for ⋀, 0.047 ± 0.002(stat.) ± 0.005(syst.) for ⊼ and 0.0101 ± 0.0020(stat.) ± 0.0009(syst.) for Ξ<sup>−</sup> +Ξ<sup>+</sup>. The results are also compared with predictions for identified particle spectra from QCD-inspired models and provide a baseline for comparisons with both future pp measurements at higher energies and heavy-ion collisions.

84901422524	Neutron emission from electromagnetic dissociation of Pb nuclei at √ s 	The ALICE Zero Degree Calorimeter system (ZDC) is composed of two identical sets of calorimeters, placed at opposite sides with respect to the interaction point, 114 meters away from it, complemented by two small forward electromagnetic calorimeters (ZEM). Each set of detectors consists of a neutron (ZN) and a proton (ZP) ZDC. They are placed at zero degrees with respect to the LHC axis and allow to detect particles emitted close to beam direction, in particular neutrons and protons emerging from hadronic heavy-ion collisions (spectator nucleons) and those emitted from electromagnetic processes. For neutrons emitted by these two processes, the ZN calorimeters have nearly 100% acceptance. During the √ s

84901491096	J/Ψ production and nuclear effects in p-Pb collisions at √sNN=5.02 TeV	Inclusive J/Ψ production has been studied with the ALICE detector in p-Pb collisions at the nucleon-nucleon center of mass energy √sNN = 5.02TeV at the CERN LHC. The measurement is performed in the center of mass rapidity domains 2.03 < ycms < 3.53 and ?4.46 < ycms < ?2.96, down to zero transverse momentum, studying the μ+μ? decay mode. In this paper, the J/Ψ production cross section and the nuclear modification factor RpPb for the rapidities under study are presented. While at forward rapidity, corresponding to the proton direction, a suppression of the J/Ψ yield with respect to binary-scaled pp collisions is observed, in the backward region no suppression is present. The ratio of the forward and backward yields is also measured differentially in rapidity and transverse momentum. Theoretical predictions based on nuclear shadowing, as well as on models including, in addition, a contribution from partonic energy loss, are in fair agreement with the experimental results.

84904571237	Technical design report for the upgrade of the ALICE inner tracking system	ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is studying the physics of strongly interacting matter, and in particular the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), using proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN LHC (Large Hadron Collider). The ALICE Collaboration is preparing a major upgrade of the experimental apparatus, planned for installation in the second long LHC shutdown in the years 2018-2019. A key element of the ALICE upgrade is the construction of a new, ultra-light, high-resolution Inner Tracking System (ITS) based on monolithic CMOS pixel detectors. The primary focus of the ITS upgrade is on improving the performance for detection of heavy-flavour hadrons, and of thermal photons and low-mass di-electrons emitted by the QGP. With respect to the current detector, the new Inner Tracking System will significantly enhance the determination of the distance of closest approach to the primary vertex, the tracking efficiency at low transverse momenta, and the read-out rate capabilities. This will be obtained by seven concentric detector layers based on a 50 μm thick CMOS pixel sensor with a pixel pitch of about 30×30 μm

These plans are presented in the ALICE Upgrade Letter of Intent, submitted to the LHCC (LHC experiments Committee) in September 2012. In order to fully exploit the physics reach of the LHC in this field, high-precision measurements of the heavy-flavour production, quarkonia, direct real and virtual photons, and jets are necessary. This will be achieved by an increase of the LHC Pb-Pb instant luminosity up to 6×10

84908689756	Freeze-out radii extracted from three-pion cumulants in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC	In high-energy collisions, the spatio-temporal size of the particle production region can be measured using the Bose-Einstein correlations of identical bosons at low relative momentum. The source radii are typically extracted using two-pion correlations, and characterize the system at the last stage of interaction, called kinetic freeze-out. In low-multiplicity collisions, unlike in high-multiplicity collisions, two-pion correlations are substantially altered by background correlations, e.g. mini-jets. Such correlations can be suppressed using three-pion cumulant correlations. We present the first measurements of the size of the system at freeze-out extracted from three-pion cumulant correlations in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC with ALICE. At similar multiplicity, the invariant radii extracted in p-Pb collisions are found to be 5-15% larger than those in pp, while those in Pb-Pb are 35-55% larger than those in p-Pb. Our measurements disfavor models which incorporate substantially stronger collective expansion in p-Pb as compared to pp collisions at similar multiplicity.

84908370907	Suppression of ϒ{hooked}(1S) at forward rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV	We report on the measurement of the inclusive ϒ{hooked}(1S) production in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV carried out at forward rapidity (2.5<y<4) and down to zero transverse momentum using its μ+μ- decay channel with the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. A strong suppression of the inclusive ϒ{hooked}(1S) yield is observed with respect to pp collisions scaled by the number of independent nucleon-nucleon collisions. The nuclear modification factor, for events in the 0-90% centrality range, amounts to 0.30±0.05(stat)±0.04(syst). The observed ϒ{hooked}(1S) suppression tends to increase with the centrality of the collision and seems more pronounced than in corresponding mid-rapidity measurements. Our results are compared with model calculations, which are found to underestimate the measured suppression and fail to reproduce its rapidity dependence.

84911032256	Multiparticle azimuthal correlations in p -Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider	Measurements of multiparticle azimuthal correlations (cumulants) for charged particles in p-Pb at sNN=5.02 TeV and Pb-Pb at sNN=2.76 TeV collisions are presented. They help address the question of whether there is evidence for global, flowlike, azimuthal correlations in the p-Pb system. Comparisons are made to measurements from the larger Pb-Pb system, where such evidence is established. In particular, the second harmonic two-particle cumulants are found to decrease with multiplicity, characteristic of a dominance of few-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions. However, when a |Δη| gap is placed to suppress such correlations, the two-particle cumulants begin to rise at high multiplicity, indicating the presence of global azimuthal correlations. The Pb-Pb values are higher than the p-Pb values at similar multiplicities. In both systems, the second harmonic four-particle cumulants exhibit a transition from positive to negative values when the multiplicity increases. The negative values allow for a measurement of v2{4} to be made, which is found to be higher in Pb-Pb collisions at similar multiplicities. The second harmonic six-particle cumulants are also found to be higher in Pb-Pb collisions. In Pb-Pb collisions, we generally find v2{4}≃v2{6}≠0 which is indicative of a Bessel-Gaussian function for the v2 distribution. For very high-multiplicity Pb-Pb collisions, we observe that the four- and six-particle cumulants become consistent with 0. Finally, third harmonic two-particle cumulants in p-Pb and Pb-Pb are measured. These are found to be similar for overlapping multiplicities, when a |Δη|>1.4 gap is placed.

84918542463	Measurement of prompt D -meson production in p-Pb collisions at sNN =5.02TeV	The pT-differential production cross sections of the prompt charmed mesons D0, D+, D∗+, and Ds+ and their charge conjugate in the rapidity interval -0.96<ycms<0.04 were measured in p-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy sNN=5.02TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The nuclear modification factor RpPb, quantifying the D-meson yield in p-Pb collisions relative to the yield in pp collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, is compatible within the 15%-20% uncertainties with unity in the transverse momentum interval 1<pT<24GeV/c. No significant difference among the RpPb of the four D-meson species is observed. The results are described within uncertainties by theoretical calculations that include initial-state effects. The measurement adds experimental evidence that the modification of the momentum spectrum of D mesons observed in Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions is due to strong final-state effects induced by hot partonic matter.

84918569526	Exclusive J /ψ photoproduction off protons in ultraperipheral p -Pb collisions at sNN =5.02TeV	We present the first measurement at the LHC of exclusive J/ψ photoproduction off protons, in ultraperipheral proton-lead collisions at sNN=5.02TeV. Events are selected with a dimuon pair produced either in the rapidity interval, in the laboratory frame, 2.5<y<4 (p-Pb) or -3.6<y<-2.6 (Pb-p), and no other particles observed in the ALICE acceptance. The measured cross sections σ(γ+p→J/ψ+p) are 33.2±2.2(stat)±3.2(syst)±0.7(theor)nb in p-Pb and 284±36(stat)-32+27(syst)±26(theor)nb in Pb-p collisions. We measure this process up to about 700 GeV in the γp center of mass, which is a factor of two larger than the highest energy studied at HERA. The data are consistent with a power law dependence of the J/ψ photoproduction cross section in γp energies from about 20 to 700 GeV, or equivalently, from Bjorken x scaling variable between ∼2×10-2 and ∼2×10-5, thus indicating no significant change in the gluon density behavior of the proton between HERA and LHC energies.

84918578120	Suppression of ψ(2S) production in p-Pb collisions at (Formula presneted.)	Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration has studied the inclusive production of the charmonium state ψ(2S) in proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at the nucleon-nucleon centre of mass energy (formula presented.) = 5.02 TeV at the CERN LHC. The measurement was performed at forward (2.03 < y<inf>cms</inf>< 3.53) and backward (−4.46 < y<inf>cms</inf>< −2.96) centre of mass rapidities, studying the decays into muon pairs. In this paper, we present the inclusive production cross sections σ<inf>ψ(2S)</inf>, both integrated and as a function of the transverse momentum p<inf>T</inf>, for the two y<inf>cms</inf> domains. The results are compared to those obtained for the 1S vector state (J/ψ), by showing the ratios between the production cross sections, as well as the double ratios [σ<inf>ψ(2S)</inf>/σ<inf>J/ψ</inf> ]<inf>pPb</inf>/[σ<inf>ψ(2S)</inf>/σ<inf>J/ψ</inf>]<inf>pp</inf> between p-Pb and proton-proton collisions. Finally, the nuclear modification factor for inclusive ψ(2S) is evaluated and compared to the measurement of the same quantity for J/ψ and to theoretical models including parton shadowing and coherent energy loss mechanisms. The results show a significantly larger suppression of the ψ(2S) compared to that measured for J/ψ and to models. These observations represent a clear indication for sizeable final state effects on ψ(2S) production.[Figure not available: see fulltext.

Van der Meer scans were performed for both configurations of colliding beams, and the cross section was measured for two reference processes, based on particle detection by the T0 and V0 detectors, with pseudo-rapidity coverage 4.6 < η < 4.9, -3.3 < η < -3.0 and 2.8 < η < 5.1, -3.7 < η < -1.7, respectively. Given the asymmetric detector acceptance, the cross section was measured separately for the two configurations. The measured visible cross sections are used to calculate the integrated luminosity of the proton-lead and lead-proton data samples, and to indirectly measure the cross section for a third, configuration-independent, reference process, based on neutron detection by the Zero Degree Calorimeters.

84919949089	Event-by-event mean pT fluctuations in pp and Pb–Pb collisions at the LHC	Event-by-event fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum of charged particles produced in pp collisions at 0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV, and Pb–Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV are studied as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity using the ALICE detector at the LHC. Dynamical fluctuations indicative of correlated particle emission are observed in all systems. The results in pp collisions show little dependence on collision energy. The Monte Carlo event generators PYTHIA and PHOJET are in qualitative agreement with the data. Peripheral Pb–Pb data exhibit a similar multiplicity dependence as that observed in pp. In central Pb–Pb, the results deviate from this trend, featuring a significant reduction of the fluctuation strength. The results in Pb–Pb are in qualitative agreement with previous measurements in Au–Au at lower collision energies and with expectations from models that incorporate collective phenomena.
