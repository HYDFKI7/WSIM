9644272885	Quantitatively predicate state of adhesion between coating/metal interface by EIS measurements	According to the experimental results and the basic concept that the capacitive contribution of the coating/metal system to EIS can reflect the change occurring at interface sensitively, the quantitative relationship between the adhesion and the analytical result of EIS is established. The approach is using the transmission line model(CR circuit) to obtain the discrete capacitance values, analyzing the physical meaning of the slope at the region in which the discrete capacitances change linearly with the discrete characteristic frequency. The data handling method is also given in detail. The relationship is validated by experiments. The results show that under certain conditions, the slopes are mainly determined by the speed of instantaneous delamination at organic coating/ metal interface and are not influenced by the corrosion product built up at the artificial defect, so they have good reproducibility despite the EIS of duplicate samples showing very different configuration. The analytical results from EIS are often higher than that of mechanical measurements when adhesion is strong. Explanation of the discrepancy shows that the results from EIS are more accurate and reasonable. In regard to epoxy powder paints and A

14844364298	Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy during corrosion process of 8090 Al-Li alloy in EXCO solution	The corrosion behavior and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) features of 8090 Al-Li alloys in EXCO solution were investigated, and the EIS was simulated using an equivalent circuit. At the beginning of immersion in EXCO solution, the EIS is comprised by a depressed capacitive arc at high-mediate frequency and an inductive arc at low frequency, and the inductive component decreases and disappears with immersion time. Once exfoliation or severe pitting corrosion is produced, two capacitive arcs appear in the EIS. These two capacitive arcs are originated from the two parts of the corroded alloy surface, the original flat alloy surface and the new inter-face exposed to the aggressive EXCO solution due to the exfoliation or pitting corrosion. Some corrosion development features of 8090 Al-Li alloys in EXCO solution can be obtained through simulated EIS information.

15844376335	Analysis of pitting corrosion behavior of pure Al in sodium chloride solution with the wavelet technique	The potential electrochemical noise (EN) measurements in conjunction with the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique have been used to study the corrosion behavior of pure aluminum in neutral 3.0 wt% sodium chloride solution. EN information on the evolution of pitting corrosion over a period of five days has been obtained and analyzed with a wavelet transform technique. The results show that the EN signal was composed of a distinct type of events characterized by small scaling values, i.e., their time constants, and the wavelet transform technique is a useful alternative tool to overcome the limitations of FFT. Meanwhile, it is found that the energy distribution plots (EDP) can be used as "fingerprints" of EN signals, and good correspondence between the characteristics of EDP and the material corrosion type/severity has been obtained. Finally, the relationship between the EN features and the corrosion morphologies has been elucidated according to the "autoacceleration" and "cathodic protection" mechanisms of the corrosion process. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that the corrosion of pure aluminum was greatly inhibited by the addition of ZnO and dimethyl amine epoxy propane (designated as DE). EIS and EDAX analyses revealed that ZnO produces its effect by depositing on the aluminum surface, which increases the overpotential of hydrogen evolution.

14844354839	Study of the X70 pipeline steel corroding in 3.0wt% NaCl solution using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique	The corrosion process of the X70 pipeline steel in 3.0wt% NaCl solution were studied using polarization method, and the chronological characteristics during the entire polarization plot were investigated in detail using EIS technique. In the active region of X70 steel, such as 20 mV potential bias applied on open circuit potential (OCP), the impedance spectra was comprised of three pans: a high-frequency capacitive loop, a middle-frequency capacitive loop and a low-frequency inductive component. When positive polarization potential increased, the capacitive loops at high and middle frequency range merged, and the inductive component at low frequency shrunk. At high positive polarization potential bias (500-800 mV vs. OCP), the high-frequency capacitive loop and the low-frequency inductive loop exhibited as disheveled points due to the synergism of the inhomogeneity of the corroding material and the localized corrosion. The results were fitted utilizing the equivalent circuits to simulate the impedance spectra and to interpret the electrochemical features shown during the experiments.

It was found that the EN generated during the electroplating of dentritic or large conglomerate zinc deposit has large potential oscillation amplitude and positive potential drift while the compact zinc deposit possesses small noise amplitude and little potential drift. Meanwhile, the electrocrystallization EN time-domain records were analyzed using wavelet transform technique, the results shown that, with the change of the rate determining step of zinc electroplating process from diffusion-control through mixed-control to activation-control, the maximum relative energy of the EDP (relative energy distribution plot) obtained from wavelet analysis shifted from the region with larger scales to those with smaller scales, and the corresponding deposit structure changed from dentritic to compact, i.e., the EDP can be used as "fingerprints" of EN to characterize the electroplating process and the deposit structure.

2042482021	Influence of zinc content and surface contamination on the electrochemical behaviors of epoxy zinc-rich primer	The effect of zinc powder content and contamination of epoxy zinc-rich primer/substrate interface on the protective performance of the zinc-rich coatings was investigated by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and corrosion potential monitoring. The degradation mechanism of the zinc-rich coatings was elucidated. It was shown that effective barrier can not be formed in the coatings with low zinc content. The attack of zinc particles in zinc-rich coatings is explained in terms of diffusion control through the film of zinc corrosion products around the zinc particles. The surface contamination of the substrate is vital to the performance of the organic coatings protecting the substrate steel. The surface contamination will lead to not only the impairment of the performance of the zinc-rich coatings but also the acceleration of the degradation processes of the steel substrate.

Various colour films could be obtained by using alternating voltage (AV) passivation in hot sulphuric acid solution. Unlike the INCO process, this process is operated in a bath containing no chromic acid, which is toxic to the environment.

0000147852	Study of early cycling deterioration of a Ni/MH battery by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy	a.c. impedance measurements are made on spiral-wound, size 4/5A, Ni/MH batteries, which are prepared by using direct-seal technology. Both the positive and the negative electrodes are fabricated by filling in a porous nickel substrate with the active materials. The main purpose of the investigation is to determine the cause(s) of the early cycling deterioration of this foam-type battery. The results demonstrate that the cycle-life curve can be divided into three parts. After little change in capacity and voltage, deterioration of the Ni/MH battery occurs as the voltage performance decreases. This is followed by a sharp decrease in both the discharge capacity and the voltage performance. The decrease in voltage performance is due to drying of the separator, which increases the total ohmic resistance of the battery, while the decrease of discharge capacity is due to an inactive surface that increases the charge-transfer resistance of the battery. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

The effects of coupling agent type, its content, curing temperature and application procedure on the anticorrosion behavior were investigated. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and adhesive strength measurements were used to assess the corrosion prevention performance of the modified coatings. The results showed that the steel substrate pretreated with methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane(A174) and cured at 120°C exhibited excellent anticorrosion performance, which could be attributed to the formation of a new interfacial layer with high hydrophobicity and strong adhesive strength.

0032428617	Corrosion prevention of reinforcing steel by acrylic latex	Acrylic emulsion was introduced into steel reinforcing concrete as concrete admixtures or rebar coatings in order to prevent steel reinforcements from corrosion. Specimens were immersed in 3% NaCl solution as accelerating corrosion test for up to 60 days. The corrosion behavior of each specimen at different immersion time was investigated with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(ELS) method. The results showed that breakdown of the passive layer on the steel surface were deferred when incorporating 20% acrylic emulsion into concrete while its permeability remanining unchanged. The corrosion rate can also be reduced to a considerable extent when using steel rebar coated with acrylic emulsions. The active state of steel surface under the emulsion coatings was ascertained by comparing the impedance spectroscopy before and after cathodic activation. On the basis of these results, some proposals were presented to enhance the anticorrosion ability of the emulsion coatings. All above showed that acrylic emulsion is a promising material for corrosion prevention of reinforcing concrete.

During the initial stage of immersion, the EN amplitude of AA2024 is the largest while the EN amplitude of pure aluminum is negligible. The amplitude of the EN generated by these materials decreases with immersion time except the EN of AA2024 after extremely long immersion time (38 days in this study). Surface morphology corresponding to different stages of immersion and different types of EN were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analysis. The result shows that the micro-galvanic cells formed by the constituent particles and the alloy matrix play an important role on the corrosion process of the aluminum alloys and the EN behaviors of AA2024, AA7075 and pure aluminum is proved to be strongly related to the type and intensity of corrosion process.

2442703288	A study of the corrosion of aluminum alloy 2024-T3 under thin electrolyte layers	The corrosion of aluminum alloy 2024-T3 (AA2024-T3) under thin electrolyte layers was studied in 3.0 wt% sodium chloride solutions by cathodic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method. The cathodic polarization measurements show that, when the electrolyte layer is thicker than 200 μm, the oxygen reduction current is close to that of the bulk solution. But in the range of 200-100 μm, the oxygen reduction current is inversely proportional to the layer thickness, which shows that the oxygen diffusion through the electrolyte layer is the rate-determining step for the oxygen reduction process. In the range of 100 μm to about 58 μm, the oxygen reduction current is slightly decreased probably due to the formation of aluminum hydroxide or the change of the diffusion pattern from 2-dimensional diffusion to one-dimensional diffusion. The further decrease in electrolyte layer thickness increase the oxygen reduction current to some extent again, because the diffusion of oxygen plays more important role in thin electrolyte layers. The EIS measurements show that the corrosion is controlled by the cathodic oxygen reduction at the initial stage, showing the largest corrosion rate at the electrolyte layer thickness of 105 μm. But at the later stage of corrosion, the anodic process begin to affect the corrosion rates and the corrosion rates show a maximum at 170 μm, which may be the thickness where the corrosion changes from cathodic control to anodic control. The corrosion rate under the very thin electrolyte layer (62 μm in this study) is even smaller than that in bulk solution, this is due to that the anodic process is strongly inhibited. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

There are two time constants for these coatings, the first one is attributed to the contact impedances between the different zinc particles and the second one is related to the charge transfer resistance of the Zn dissolution process. Furthermore, the EIS data of ZRC were interpreted according to equivalent circuit models. The corresponding parameters were derived to assess the coating deterioration with time and the performance between zinc dust primers and zinc flake primers were compared. The results showed that the zinc flake reduced the cathodic protection period of the ZRC and rapidly produced a little compact barrier.

The results show that the whole corrosion process of weathering steels can be divided into four segments: metstable-pitting region, stable pitting region, medial corrosion region and general corrosion region. Q400NQR1 possesses higher anticorrosion ability than 09CuPCrNi due to the formation of the denser inner corrosion products layer, which covered on the surface of the Q400NQR1 substrate and inhibited the diffusion of the corrosive species from the environment to the substrate.

The localized corrosion form of the alloy during immersion evolved from pitting through intergranular corrosion, exfoliation corrosion (EC) to post EC. EC initiated at big corrosion pits which were formed with inclusion phase as center in pitting stage. The EC blisters propagate from these big pits till the upper layer is totally lifted. EIS of the initiation stage of pitting corrosion consists of a high frequency capacitive arc and a middle-low frequency inductive arc, and the inductive arc tends to disappear when pitting corrosion starts to propagate. In the intergranular corrosion stage, the second time constant corresponding to the corroded area can hardly be distinguished in the capacitive part of the EIS. In the stages of EC propagation and post EC, their EIS consist of two capacitive arcs.

In the case of pH 3.5 and during the entire corrosion process, the Nyquist plot was composed of a high-frequency capacitive arc due to corrosion reaction and a low-frequency capacitive arc due to the formation of corrosion products layer, and the corrosion rate during the same cycle was almost the same. In the case of pH 4.5 and during the first several cycles, the Nyquist plot was composed of nearly only one capacitive arc due to the corrosion reaction, and the corrosion rate during the same cycle increased with time.

33645137577	Corrosion protection of Nd-Fe-B magnets by silanization	Nd-Fe-B type permanent magnets present excellent magnetic properties. However, they are highly sensitive to the attack of corrosive environment. The aim of the present work is to describe the improvement of corrosion resistance of such magnets by dodecyl trimethoxysilane (DTMS) treatment. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests showed that, after treated by either DTMS, phosphate or chromate precursor, the protectiveness of Nd-Fe-B alloys was apparently increased. Corrosion performance of magnet treated with silane only was slightly inferior to those of phosphatized or chromatized ones. However, significant improvement in corrosion protection was achieved after two-step treatments, i.e. by top-coating silane films on phosphate or chromate under-layer. The depth profiles of element concentrations on surfaces measured by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) indicate a two-layer surface structure for two-step treated samples. Co-existing of silane and phosphate or chromate was detected in the top-layer, suggesting the interaction between the two components. This results in the formation of more stable structure of hybrid organ-inorganic coatings against the attack of corrosive species. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is observed that illumination of the sample leads to a decrease in its pitting susceptibility as indicated by pitting potential and incubation time measurements in chloride containing electrolytes. This effect is strongly dependent on the applied potential during passivation. The electronic properties of the passive films on X70 steel were studied by Mott-Schottky analysis and photocurrent transient measurements. The results indicated that illumination during passivation led to modifications in the electronic properties of the passive films, mainly to a decrease of the bulk doping and an increase in the surface state density. The cause for the decrease in the pitting susceptibility is preliminary explained in terms of such modifications of the passive film.

Meanwhile, Potentiodynamic polarization and SEM techniques were also used as assistant measurements. Three mathematic methods including average, standard deviation and wavelet transformation have been employed to analyze the records. The results showed that each single wet-dry cycle can be divided into three regions with respect to the change of the cathodic reaction rate, and with the increase of pH value the main cathodic reaction changes from the reduction of protons to that of oxygen molecules. The analysis of the EDP versus time evolution clearly indicates that the whole corrosion process can be divided into three segments for the case of pH 3.5 and only one for the cases of pH 4.5 and 6.0, which have been theoretically interpreted according to the corrosion theory and experimentally proved by SEM. The results also showed that the corrosion in the case of pH 3.5 was much more rigorous than that in the cases of pH 4.5 and 6.0. It may due to synergistic effects of that, the characteristic of hydrogen ions which is much more active than that of oxygen molecules, the high diffusion/migration rate of hydrogen ions in solution or through surface films and the lower stability of surface passive film at low pH value system. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed that the impedances of composite electrodes continuously increased with increasing of immersion time. In the beginning of immersion, the diffusion impedance emerged in the impedance spectroscopy of composite electrode, which was considered to result from the mass transport behavior of solving products of passivation film prepared on metal substrates. The observation of scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicated that the chromate conversion film presented the obvious crack morphology on metal substrates, which is favourable the solved chromate for penetrating through the film and passivate the metal substrate surface.

This work mainly investigated the effects of electrodeposition potential on the corrosion properties of silane films. Films prepared at cathodic potentials display an improvement in corrosion inhibition properties, while those prepared at anodic potentials present the deterioration of protectiveness. In the case of cathodic deposition, when the potential shifts negatively from the open-circuit potential (OCP), corrosion protection of the obtained films initially increases and then decreases, with the optimal deposition potential at -0.8 V/SCE. As indicated in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, films deposited at the optimum potential present the most uniform and compact morphologies. In addition, steady-state polarization and current-time curves have been also recorded on Al alloys in BTSE solutions during the deposition, respectively. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of the modification is to reduce the water uptake of polymeric coatings. The water absorption of coatings was measured by coating capacitance method in 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution. The result indicates that water uptake of epoxy coatings modified with 1.0 wt.% γ-APS decreases compared with pure epoxy coatings, whereas larger amounts of sliane result in the deterioration in performance against water permeation, due to the excessive consumption of epoxide group in epoxy resin by amino-group in silane agent, thus reduce the cross-linking of epxoy coating as a result of presence of excessive curing agent (polyamide).

The Reflection-Absorption Fourier Transform IR (FTRA-IR) measurements showed that, the silane films were successfully deposited through chemical bonding between silane agents and Al alloys. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests indicated that in comparison with those by conventional "dip-coating" method, silane films electrochemically prepared at cathodic potentials exhibited obviously higher corrosion resistances. "Critical potential" was all observed for each silane system. Silane films prepared at this potential performed the highest corrosion resistance. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images indicated a potential dependence of surface morphology of silane films. The highest compactness was obtained at the "critical potential". Due to the presence of long hydrophobic dodecyl chain in bone structure, DTMS films displayed the highest barrier properties. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PBGE particles, characterized by means of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), reveal good stability and their particle sizes are 30-50 nm. The initial cyclic properties of the absorptive glass mat (AGM)-PBGE and AGM-colloid silica gel electrolyte (CSGE) hybrid batteries are investigated by electrochemical techniques, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The addition of PBGE improves the utilization efficiency of positive active material (PAM) in AGM-PBGE hybrid batteries and thus enhances the batteries capacity compared with the AGM-CSGE reference batteries. Cyclic overdischarge tests show that the AGM-PBGE hybrid batteries have superior recharge and discharge during partial-state-of-charge (PSoC). It is also found that the greatly enhanced electrochemical performance of the AGM-PBGE batteries may be due to higher charge efficiency, good conductivity with lower internal resistance and the open three-dimensional network structure of the polyelectrolyte. The analysis results of SEM and XRD indicate that softening and shedding of positive active material are the main causes of failure for the two hybrid batteries. © 2007.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that PBGE is more stable than fumed-silica gel electrolyte (FSGE). The properties of AGM (absorptive glass mat)-PBGE and PVC-FSGE tubular batteries were investigated by electrochemical techniques. The results showed that the AGM-PBGE tubular batteries have higher initial discharge capacity and better high-low temperature performance than PVC-FSGE. The improved electrochemical performance of the AGM-PBGE batteries may result from the high charge efficiency and the open three-dimensional network structure of PBGE. SEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy showed that PBGE facilitates the conversion of the active-mass to lead dioxide, presenting a high formation efficiency. The addition of PBGE instead of FSGE not only simplifies the manufacturing process of tubular gel batteries, but also improves the utilization efficiency of positive active material (PAM), thus enhancing the battery performance and reducing the manufacturing cost. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The anodizing technological parameters have been optimized and a kind of ivory-white smooth anodic film with high corrosion resistance was obtained. It was found that the formation of the anodic films was always coupled with sparking and oxygen evolution, whose intensity changed with the additive and anodizing voltage.

Cathodic polarization result indicates that the cathodic limiting current density increases with decreasing the TEL thickness. EIS result shows that the corrosion rate increases with decreasing the TEL thickness at the initial stage because the corrosion is dominated by the cathodic process, whereas after long immersion time, the corrosion degree with the TEL thickness is in the sequence of 150 μm > 310 μm >100 μm ≈ bulk solution > 57 μm.

Results show that, under the experimental conditions, the initial reduction process of tin is controlled by diffusion and follows the three-dimensional (3D) nucleation and subsequent grain growth mechanism. With the increase of the applied cathodic overpotentials, the nucleation type of tin changes from progressive mechanism to instantaneous mechanism. When the deposition overpotential is high, the electrode surface is fully covered with tin deposits in short times that the current-time transient is composed of the tin nucleation current and the current attributed to proton reduction on the tin growth centers while the current due to proton reduction on the steel surface should be considered as well at low deposition overpotentials. Results also reveal that both the tin nucleation and proton reduction rate constant increase with increasing the cathodic overpotentials, and the proton reduction rate constant on the steel substrate surface is larger than that on the tin growth centers.

The fitting results using suitable electrical equivalent circuits (EEC) suggested that there were four kinds of impedance models in the course of immersion. In the initial period of immersion, an EEC containing the coating capacitance and the coating resistance was used to fit the EIS data. Along with the immersion time, the number of time-constant of impedance spectra for metal/coating systems increased, indicating that corrosion reaction took place. After a certain time's attacking of metal substrates, the diffusion process towards solution of corrosion products forming at the metal/coating interface might be restrained due to the presence of coating barrier, resulting in the appearance of diffusion elements. This diffusion did not act as an ideal Warburg behavior, leading to a deviation of dispersive number, n, from 0.5. After longer immersion times, the Cl

64149087977	Electrochemical noise characteristics in corrosion process of AZ91D magnesium alloy in neutral chloride solution	The corrosion process of AZ91D magnesium alloy in neutral 1% (mass fraction) sodium chloride aqueous solution was investigated by electrochemical noise(EN), SEM and EDX. Fractal theory was primarily used to depict the corrosion process of the alloy. The fast wavelet transform(FWT), as well as the fast Fourier transform(FFT), was employed to analyze the EN data. The results show that the overall corrosion process can be described by three stages. The first stage corresponds to the pit nucleation and growth; the second stage involves the growth of a passive oxide layer; and the third stage involves reactivation. With increasing immersion time, fractal dimension increases fast initially, fluctuates in the medium and increases again at last. Pitting corrosion and fractal dimension increase due to the initiation and formation of pits in the initial and the end of immersion, while depresses due to the passivation in the medium period. The results of SEM and EDX support the above conclusions. © 2009 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

In the present paper, the Ce(III)-doped bis-[triethoxysilypropyl]tetrasulphide (BTESPT) films with higher corrosion resistance were prepared by electro-assisted technique. The films were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), water contact angle measurements and Fourier transform reflection absorption IR (FTRA-IR). The results showed that both the cathodic deposition and cerium-doping can promote the formation of thicker and compacter silane films and enhance their protectiveness in the early stage of immersion in the corrosive media. However, it seems that the Ce(III)-doped BTESPT films prepared by electrodeposition lose their self-healing abilities after long-term immersion. The reason is still unclear, but might be attributed to the precipitation of Ce(III) oxides or hydroxides during the electrodeposition of doped silane films. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77957947577	Evaluation of protectiveness of organic coatings by means of High-Frequency EIS measurement	In this paper, the evolution of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) behavior for the red ron oxide pigmented epoxy coatings on aluminum alloys in 3. 5 mass% NaCl solution was investigated, and two methods for rapidly evaluating the protectiveness of organic coatings based on high-frequency EIS data were proposed, i.e. the partial fitting coating resistance method and the corrected break-point frequency method. The partially fitted coating resistance from high-frequency EIS data and the coating resistance fitted from all-frequency EIS data showed similar evolution trends as a function of immersion time, although they had different values. The partially fitted coating resistance also well reflected the degradation of the coatings, indicating it could be used for monitoring the performance of coatings. In addition, we corrected the traditional break-point frequency method which was generally used for rapidly evaluating the protectiveness of coatings by considering the non-ideal coating capacitance. It was observed that as the immersion went on, the CPE power n of the coating decreased, and the difference between corrected break-point frequency and the traditional break-point frequency became more remarkable, indicating he necessity of correction for the traditional break-point frequency method.

The structure and surface morphology of Ni-TiN composite coatings were analyzed by atom force microscope, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. Meanwhile, the anti-corrosion properties, hardness and thermostability of Ni-TiN nanocomposite films were also investigated and compared with the traditional polycrystalline Ni coatings. The results show that, compared with the traditional polycrystalline Ni film, Ni-TiN nanocomposite coatings display much better corrosion resistance, higher film hardness, and thermal stability. In addition, the hardness of Ni-TiN nanocomposite coatings decreases slightly with the increase of electroplating current density, which may be due to the synergism of hydrogen evolution and faster nucleation/growth rate of nickel crystallites. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society.

Inspection of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy, the structure and composition of MAO coating formed on AZ91D with RE-film under different applied voltages were investigated and the performance of the optimized MAO coating compared with the MAO coating directly formed on magnesium alloy. As the pretreatment of magnesium alloy with RE-film, the cerium oxides can be incorporated into the MAO coatings, reduce porosity of the MAO coating surface and enhance the thickness of MAO coating. These structure features and the cerium oxides incorporated into the MAO coating result in greatly improved corrosion resistance. Base on electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement, the electronic structure and composition analysis of the MAO coating, a double-layer structure, with a compact inner layer and a porous outer layer, of the coating was proposed for understanding its corrosion process. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of voltage, frequency and duty cycle on the coatings were investigated by orthogonal experiment. It is found that the thickness of coatings increases with the increase of voltage and duty cycle, but decreases with the increase of frequency. The structure and morphology of the coatings also depend on voltage, frequency and duty cycle. The coatings become more porous and crack with increasing voltage and duty cycle. The coating is thin and transparent when the voltage is lower than 120 V. The corrosion resistances of different coatings were evaluated by polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 3.5 NaCl (mass fraction) solution. When the optimized values of voltage, frequency and duty cycle are 140 V, 2 000 Hz and 0.4, respectively, the anodic coating shows the best corrosion resistance. © 2011 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

The most relevant feature of this method of anlysis is its capability of decomposing electrochemical noise records into different sets of wavelet coefficients, which contain information about the time scale characteristic of the associated corrosion event. The potential noise fluctuations during the free corrosion of pure aluminum in sodium chloride solution was recorded and analyzed with wavelet transform technique. The typical results showed that the EN signal is composed of distinct type of events, which can be classified according to their scales, i.e. their time constants.

79960159021	Corrosion behavior of pure zinc and its alloy under thin electrolyte layer	The corrosion behavior of zinc and its alloy under thin electrolyte layers (TEL) in 0.1M NaCl solution was investigated by cathodic polarization curves and EIS. There was only one phase in pure zinc while zinc alloy consisted of eutectic phase and primary phase. Corrosion rate of zinc alloy was faster than that of pure zinc due to the effect of the micro-galvanic couples between the primary phase and the eutectic phase. The results indicated that corrosion rate of zinc alloy was greatly enhanced under TEL than that in bulk solution. Pure zinc exhibited minimum corrosion resistance as TEL decreased to 198 μm. Zinc and its alloy exhibited localized corrosion under TEL while it was more uniform in bulk solution. There were two capacitive loops in high frequency (HF) and middle frequency (MF) respectively, with finite length diffusion in low frequency (LF) presented in EIS. For pure zinc under TEL below 300 μm an additional inductive loop presented in MF-LF.

The addition of ZnO markedly inhibited the corrosion of aluminum in 4.0 M KOH solutions, resulting from the deposition of zinc with high hydrogen evolution overpotential in aluminum surfaces. The introduction of PEG in the alkaline zincate solution obviously improved the deposition of zinc by increase in the overpotential of zinc deposition, thus the corrosion rate of aluminum in the alkaline zincate solutions with PEG was further decreased. The enhancement effect of PEG on the inhibition of zinc oxide first increased and then decreased with increasing the content of PEG in the electrolyte. The electrolyte system with 0.2 M ZnO and 2.0 mM PEG presented the highest inhibition efficiency (98.8%) for the corrosion of aluminum. The results of galvanostatic discharge indicated that the aluminum anode shows excellent discharge performances in the 4.0 M KOH solution with 0.2 M ZnO and 2.0 mM PEG. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In addition, silane-enriched layer preferentially forms at the metal/coating interface during the electrophoresis process, leading to better adhesion between the substrate and the coating.

The pattern of the polarization curve of magnesium alloy AZ91D with a MAO coating depends on the primary composition and structure of the MAO coating and many experimental factors, such as the concentration of chloride ions, pH of the electrolyte, degree of cathodic polarization, and the exposed area of the specimen. These factors change the pattern of polarization curve of magnesium alloy AZ91D with MAO coating by affecting the main composition and structure of the MAO coating because of its instability in aqueous solution. Compositional and structural changes in the MAO coating on magnesium alloy AZ91D were investigated by Fourier transform infrared microscopic mapping and the corresponding optical photographs, respectively. A model was proposed to describe the transformation of the MAO coating in aqueous NaCl solution. For magnesium alloy AZ91D with a MAO coating immersed in NaCl solution, the rate determining steps of the anodic and cathodic reactions are the mass diffusion and charge transfer steps, respectively. As a result, the corrosion current density fitted from the polarization curve is not an accurate corrosion rate. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.

Many technologies have been developed for ballast water treatment among which electrolytic treatment method has been taken as the most promising one. However, the corrosion problem of metals in treated seawater was seriously concerned by international maritime organization (IMO) and ship owners, especially the corrosion of 316L stainless steel which is widely used in the monitoring equipments of the ballast system of ships. In this study, the variation of environmental parameters of the seawater before and after electrolytic treatment was monitored. The corrosion behaviors of 316L stainless steel in both natural and treated seawater were investigated by electrochemical methods such as open-circuit potential (EOCP) measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization. The results showed that the pH value of the seawater increased and the dissolved oxygen content decreased slightly after electrolytic treatment, and the contents of dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon decreased significantly in treated seawater. The corrosion test results showed that the resistance of 316L stainless steel to pitting corrosion was enhanced in treated seawater. Compared to the system in natural seawater, the open-circuit potential of the steel in treated seawater shifted about 0.4 V positively, and charge transfer resistance of the steel greatly increased. The breakdown potential of passivation films in treated seawater positively shifted more than 0.37 V. Our experimental results suggested that the corrosion resistance of 316L stainless steel in treated seawater was improved, which was ascribed to the thickening and compactness of the passivation film formed in treated seawater. It is safe for 316L stainless steel to be used in treated ballast water with the total residual chlorine (TRC) concentration of 9.50 mg/L. © Right.

Four coatings were prepared through smelting-atomizing and oxide-acetylene flame spraying. The properties of the coatings were evaluated by cyclic oxidation tests, weight loss experiments, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiodynamic scanning technique, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). The addition of RE greatly enhanced the oxidation resistance of the coatings. This effect was attributed to the fact that RE changed the ion diffusion patterns of the coatings in the process of scale forming, resulting in more protective scales with high adhesion. The increase of chromium content in the coatings enhanced the corrosion resistance of the coatings in nitric acid solution, but in hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid solutions the result was reversed. Rare earth addition had a beneficial effect in sulfuric acid and nitric solutions, but in hydrochloric acid, the samples with RE had a corrosion rate slightly higher than that of the samples without RE addition. These results are explained by the effect that the addition of RE minimized the cathodic area of the coatings. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

The film's composition was investigated by X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The results of SECM show that the electrochemical reactivity on the surface of passive film is weakened as the film formation potential increases due to slower charge transfer rate. The heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant k calculated from approach curves decreases linearly with substrate potential increasing, resulting from different electrochemical reactivity on the surface of substrate. The electrochemical reaction resistance of the film increases with film formation potential increasing, while the point defect density decreases, indicating the film becomes less conductive. The ratio Fe3+/Fe2+ and the percentage of oxyhydroxide species increase simultaneously as the film formation potential shifts from -0.1 V to 0.7 V. The SECM and EIS results show that the film formed at 0.3 V has the strongest corrosion resistance in 0.1 M NaCl solution followed by that of 0.7 V which is more defective and porous. The degradation of passive film in NaCl solution is different from the evolution of films in non-aggressive electrolyte.

The corrosion process of rusted carbon steel and weathering steel are subjected to the anodic dissolution of Fe, and the existence of rust layer promotes the reduction of oxygen.

84904155222	Effects of reflowing temperature and time on alloy layer of tinplate and its electrochemical behavior in 3.5% NaCl solution	Effects of reflowing temperature and time on the alloy layer of tinplate and its electrochemical behavior in 3.5% NaCl solution were investigated by electrochemical measurements and surface characterization. It is found that the amount of alloy layer increases with the increase of reflowing temperature and time. Then the corrosion potential of detinned tinplate shifts positively and the corrosion rate decreases. After being coupled with tin, the detinned tinplate acts as cathode and tin acts as anode initially. However, after being exposed for some time, the potential shifts of both detinned tinplate and tin reverse the polarity of the coupling system. The galvanic current density decreases with the increase of reflowing temperature and time. © 2014 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

84907311900	Progress of study on erosion-corrosion	The current situation of study on erosion-corrosion mechanism and the influence of different environmental factors and alloy properties on erosion- corrosion is reviewed in this paper. The erosion- corrosion is mainly composed of two parts: erosion wear and electrochemical corrosion, of which the contribution to the total erosion-corrosion rate may depend upon the environmental factors. To protect metallic materials from erosion-corrosion the following measures may be effective: i.e. proper selection and addition of alloying elements, proper heat treatment and applied surface coatings as well. Meanwhile, the paper discusses the development of erosion-corrosion research in the future.

0442329148	Investigation of the Secondary Current Distribution in a Hull Cell	A new equation of secondary current distribution of the Hull cell is derived which can explain the influence of some electrochemical kinetics and mass transport on the quality of electrodeposit, and can give some instructions for the electroplating using indirect current and for the study of secondary current distribution in a modified Hull cell. The results from the theoretical equation and experimental measurement are compared with that of the experimental formula. It is shown that the result from the theoretical equation is more suitable to the actual conditions than that from the empirical formula. © 2001 The Electrochemical Society.

0346965870	Anodic dissolution of aluminum in KOH ethanol solutions	The feasibility of employing aluminum in KOH ethanol solution as a battery anode system is discussed. Weight loss measurement showed that its corrosion rate is low enough to be used in sealed batteries. Through anodic polarization, EIS and galvanostatic discharge, it was found that Al can keep electrochemical activity in a wide potential range in this system, and its discharge mechanism is similar to that of Al in aqueous solution. The discharge potential increases rapidly after a period of time, which may be caused by the discharge products deposited on the electrode surface. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

0347014826	Electrochemical noises of LC4, LY12 and pure Al in NaCl solution	Electrochemical noise (EN) test of aluminum alloys LC4, LY12 and pure aluminum in 2.0% (mass fraction) NaCl solution (pH=7.01) was reported. The potential fluctuation of the electrodes was recorded in time domain and simultaneously processed by fast Fourier transform method to gain spectra power dendsity (SPD) curves in frequency domain. It is found that EN characteristic varies with materials, that is, in time domain, pure aluminum and LC4 can stochastically exhibit sudden potential drop, which results in a sharp peak in potential-time curves, but LY12 does not. And the three features in SPD curve: W (white noise level), f

12344308306	Studies of surface treatment of aluminum alloys by BTSE silane agent	Silane films prepared from bis-1,2-[triethoxysilyl] ethane (BTSE) hydrolyzed in ethanol/water mixture on LY12 aluminum alloys were characterized by dc-polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in NaCl solution. The presence of silane films obviously improves the corrosion protection of alloys. The similar electrode kinetics of Al alloys in NaCl electrolyte were observed in the absence and in the presence of BTSE films, indicating that the silane films only act as a barrier against the attack of corrosive species. A suitable equivalent electrical circuit (EEC) for silanized samples was proposed and used throughout the work to fit the EIS data. The optimum processes of BTSE films were obtained from the orthogonal design. The corrosion protection was quantitatively evaluated by polarization resistance (R

1242287476	Studies of impedance models and water transport behaviors of polypropylene coated metals in NaCl solution	Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique, the water uptake process and the evolution of impedance models of polypropylene coated mild steels and LY12 Al alloys immersed in 3.5% (weight fraction) NaCl solution were studied. The equivalent electrical circuit (EEC) fitting results suggested that there was one single semi-circle in the impedance spectra of immersed samples in the initial period of immersion, which was corresponded to one time constant. Along with the immersion time, the number of time constant in EEC for metal/coating electrode system increased. The diffusion process towards solution of corrosion products forming on the metal/coating interface might be restrained due to the influence of coating barrier, resulting in the initiation of diffusion component in EEC. This diffusion did not act as a Warburg behavior, leading to a deviation of dispersive number, n, from 0.5. The studies revealed that the water transport in polypropylene clear varnish followed the Fickian diffusion during the initial time of exposure to the solution. After a certain time of immersion, the water uptake reached a saturation value. According to the variation of coating capacitance with time, the water diffusion coefficient was deduced. The experimental results indicated that the water diffusion coefficients in polypropylene coatings were independent of substrate materials used and coating thickness. Relative dielectric constant of dry coatings (ε

1242288295	Exfoliation corrosion of aluminum alloy AA7075 examined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy	A typical aluminum alloy, AA7075, was immersed in the EXCO solution, and its corrosion properties during different immersion time were measured repetitively using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique (EIS). The EIS data a were simulated using equivalent circuit with ZView program. The results show that once the exfoliation occurs, the low frequency inductive loop in the Nyquist plot associated with the relaxation phenomenon of reaction intermediates disappears, and the Nyquist plane is mainly composed of two capacitive arcs in the high frequency range arid low frequency range respectively. The former originates from the original corroded surface, while the latter from the newly formed interface by exfoliation corrosion (EXCO). With the increased immersion time, the high frequency capacitance arc decreases gradually, while the low frequency capacitance arc increases gradually. From the beginning of immersion up to 9 hours, charge transfer resistance gradually decreases, illustrating the acceleration of the corrosion rate, whereas the proton concentration decreases steeply, indicating the cathodic process is pre-dominant. Then the corrosion rate decreases gradually corresponding to the exhausting of proton ions. The results also show that the exfoliation corrosion is developed from pitting corrosion through intergranular corrosion to general corrosion at the end.

84923328505	The composition-dependent color evolution of anodic electrodeposited cerium oxide thin film	Cerium oxide thin films with various colors were deposited onto 316L stainless steel using anodic electrodeposition approach. The correlation between color, composition and deposition time has been established. Results show that the film color evolves from golden yellow (1.5 h), purple (3 h), blue (5 h), gray-green (7 h) and turns back to yellow (12 h) again, and all these colored films are stable in the ambient conditions. The film color is related to both the contents of Ce(III) and hydroxide species in the films. The relative content of Ce(III) increases from 21.19% to 27.57% with increasing the deposition time from 1.5 h to 7 h, and then decreases to 22.93% for the film deposited at 12 h. The content of hydroxide species shows the same variation trend as Ce(III) with the deposition time.
