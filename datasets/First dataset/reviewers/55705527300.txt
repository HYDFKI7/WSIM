26644447778	Multi-symbol accumulation maximum-selection method in fast code acquisition of DSSP systems	Pseudonoise (PN) code acquisition in a short period of time with high detection probability is required and challenging in short frame burst-mode direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) systems. A novel noncoherent approach to PN code acquisition, based on digital matched filters (DMFs), is proposed to solve the problem. It is an improved mode of the traditional maximum-selection method. By using the method of multi-symbol accumulation cell instead of the dwell and verification cell, the proposed algorithm can increase the speed of code acquisition without channel estimation, and suggests itself as an attractive approach in high-speed applications. Its performance in QPSK-DSSS systems, as well as its impact on factors such as frequency shift, signal noise radio (SNR) and spreading factor on detection probability have also been shown. The measurement results show that this algorithm is able to capture PN code fastly in the presence of moderate frequency shift under the conditions of low SNR.

35348940135	New technique for estimating and suppressing narrowband interference in DSSS systems	A generalized approach for narrowband interference (NBI) suppression in direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) communication systems using adaptive infinite impulse response (IIR) filter is presented. The excision filter coefficients depend on both the jammer power and its instantaneous frequency. The dependency of the filter construction on the jammer power is significant as it allows optimal tradeoff between interference removal and signal distortion by maximizing the receiver signal to noise ratio improvement (SNRI). Instead of traditional adaptive line enhancer (ALE) estimator, a preferable NBI estimator-Fourier interpolation estimator (FIE) is proposed. Closed-form expressions of the SNR improvement and theoretical bit error rate (BER) based on the assumption that the output of the correlator is Gaussian distributed are both derived. Performance results obtained by numerical simulation are also presented and compared with theoretical results.

A novel noncoherent approach, based on multi-symbol accumulation-to-PN code acquisition and digital matched filters (DMFs), was proposed to solve the problem. It is an improved mode of the traditional DMF single dwell algorithm. By using the method of multi-symbol accumulation, the proposed algorithm can increase the signal-noise ratio (SNR) of code phase detection statistics, so the mean acquisition time is greatly shortened under the constraints of low input SNR and low false alarm probability. Its performance in QPSK-DSSS systems was analyzed. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to capture PN code fast under the constraints of low SNR and low false alarm probability.

In contrast to the existing decision-directed (DD) algorithm, which is widely adopted for blind synchronization, MMSE phase error detector does not involve the hard symbol decision mechanism, thus it is not sensitive to the false judgment of symbol.

In this paper, we provide a simple general model for different TD-IS methods and analytical expressions for TD-IS effects on PN code tracking loops. The model includes common property of different TD-IS methods, such as DFT-based frequency excision (DFT-FE) and filter-bank-based interference suppression (FB-IS). Traditionally, the GNSS receiver operates Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation with direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signal or Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) modulation with DSSS signal. Tracking loops adopted include coherent early-late PN code tracking loop (CELL) and non-coherent early-late PN code tracking loop (NELL). By using the general model, analytical expressions derived give the positioning precision error (PPE) performance about TD-IS methods acting on CELL and NELL with BPSK-DSSS or BOC-DSSS signal in the GNSS receiver. Finally, numerical results confirm the TD-IS not cause the precision bias and when interferences exist in the GNSS signal, the CELL with the BOC-DSSS signal takes on better PPE performance under the TD-IS processing. © 2010 IEEE.

81855164884	Emergency alternative evaluation under group decision makers: A method of incorporating DS/AHP with extended TOPSIS	How to select suitable emergency alternative is critical to emergency management and has attracted much attention for both researchers and practitioners. In the process of evaluating emergency alternative problems, there usually exists incomplete and uncertain information, and the decision makers can not easily express their judgments on the candiates with exact and crisp values. The Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) is well suited for dealing with such problems and can generate comprehensive assessments for different alternatives. In this paper, the DS/AHP method and extended TOPSIS method are incorporated to solve group multi-criteria decision making (GMCDM) problems with incomplete information. The proposed method involves three steps: (1) Identify the focal elements of each decision maker according to the group decision matrix. (2) Construct the group weighted normalized belief interval decision matrix using Dempster's rule of combination. (3) Propose the Extended TOPSIS approach for group interval data to rank the emergency alternatives. In this method, the positive ideal solution vector is defined as the maximum plausibility of all emergency alternatives with respect to each criterion, and the negative ideal solution vector is defined as the minimum belief of all emergency alternatives with respect to each criterion. An emergency alternative evaluation selection problem is taken as an illustrative example to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed methods for group decision making in emergency management. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

At the center of such analyses people are often encountered with a high-dimensional multiple integrals with quite complex integrands. Conventional Gaussian quadrature is inefficient in handling problems like this, as it tends to entail tremendous computational overhead, and the principal order of its error term increase rapidly with the dimension of the integral. In this paper, we propose a new approach to calculate complex multi-fold integrals based on the number theory. In contrast to Gaussian quadrature, the proposed approach requires less computational effort, and the principal order of its error term is independent of the dimension. The effectiveness of the number theory based approach is examined in BER and capacity analyses for practical systems.

84862812377	Evaluating emergency response capacity by fuzzy AHP and 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic approach	Emergency management (EM) is a very important issue with various kinds of emergency events frequently taking place. One of the most important components of EM is to evaluate the emergency response capacity (ERC) of emergency department or emergency alternative. Because of time pressure, lack of experience and data, experts often evaluate the importance and the ratings of qualitative criteria in the form of linguistic variable. This paper presents a hybrid fuzzy method consisting fuzzy AHP and 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic approach to evaluate emergency response capacity. This study has been done in three stages. In the first stage we present a hierarchy of the evaluation index system for emergency response capacity. In the second stage we use fuzzy AHP to analyze the structure of the emergency response capacity evaluation problem. Using linguistic variables, pairwise comparisons for the evaluation criteria and sub-criteria are made to determine the weights of the criteria and sub-criteria. In the third stage, the ratings of sub-criteria are assessed in linguistic values represented by triangular fuzzy numbers to express the qualitative evaluation of experts' subjective opinions, and the linguistic values are transformed into 2-tuples. Use the 2-tuple linguistic weighted average operator (LWAO) to compute the aggregated ratings of criteria and the overall emergency response capacity (OERC) of the emergency alternative. Finally, we demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed hybrid fuzzy approach by means of comparing the emergency response capacity of three emergency alternatives. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84863115486	A multiple attribute group decision making method with its application to emergency alternative assessment	Due to the different educational background, experience, career and social status etc., decision makers have different acquaintance degrees of each attribute. Therefore, in this paper, a novel multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) method is proposed, in which the weights of decision makers on each attribute are evaluated separately by using similarity. Then, intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (IFWA) operator is used to aggregate individual preference information a collective opinion. Secondly, modified grey relational analysis (GRA) method is used to obtain the relative relational degree of each alternative from positive ideal solution (PIS). Finally, according to the descending order of the relative relational degree, all feasible alternatives are ranked. A numerical example of emergency alternative assessment is used to illustrate the application of the proposed MAGDM method and to demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness.

84864994926	A study of the correlation between online tutors' social network position and their performance	The paper applies the SNA methods to analyze the social network formed by the actors in the Working Forum of E-Learning Workshop set up by School of Distance Education of the Peking University. It finds that some actors participating in the Working Forum of E-learning Workshop are in the center of the network map and some are at the far edge, and of those who are in the center of the network map, most are online tutors. It also finds that the online tutors' centrality in the Working Forum is positively correlated with their performance remuneration, especially when they have served as online tutor for many times. So it suggests that the centrality of an online tutor in the Working Forum can be regarded as an evaluation factor to form a more comprehensive evaluation framework of online tutors. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84869168811	The way of fully optical acquisition for the near earth surface laser communication	Space laser communication possess lots of advantages, such as speed, security, and the strong ability of resisting electromagnetic interference, etc, which recently receiving more and more attentions. But the acquisition process, it almost uses electric methods and the ability of resisting electromagnetic interference is poor. How to realize safe and reliable beam acquisition on the near earth surface with complicated electromagnetic environment is one of the factors that restrict the application of the laser communication. This article, in view of the above requirements, puts forward an elliptical beacon light realizing fully optical acquisition method, and establishes a mathematic model of scan acquisition and then discusses the parameters of beam spot shape. Finally, we analyze the relationship between acquisition time and beam spot shape, and the result shows that, this method can realize the beacon light of capture, and provides feasible technology solutions for laser communications under the complicated electromagnetic environment through the reasonable design beam divergence angle and scanning speed. © 2012 IEEE.

84872501855	Extension of VIKOR method for multi-criteria group decision making problem with linguistic information	A new method is proposed to solve multi-criteria group decision making problems in which both the criteria values and criteria weights take the form of linguistic information based on the traditional idea of VIKOR method. Firstly, the linguistic criteria weights given by all decision makers are transformed into trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, and then aggregated and defuzzified to crisp values. Secondly, the individual linguistic decision matrix given by each decision maker (DM) is transformed into 2-tuple linguistic decision matrix, and then aggregated into collective 2-tuple linguistic decision matrix by 2-tuple linguistic arithmetic mean operation. Thirdly, the 2-tuple linguistic values (S

84876016275	A novel method of interference suppression in DSSS based on adaptive digital heterodyne notch filters	The degradation of receiver performance due to narrowband interference in DSSS can be improved by mitigation. The adaptive digital heterodyne notch filter can suppress strong narrowband interference efficiently by interference cancellation. Combined with the idea of FFT spectral analysis and timedomain adaptive notch, the paper presents a new structure improving on digital heterodyne adaptive notch filters. This filter can adaptively track the interference frequency and control the bandwidth and depth of notch, which has the excellent agility and utility. Through simulation, it is demonstrated that this method enhances the stability of the filter system, can quickly track the interference frequency, and has little influence on signal spectrum. © 2012 IEEE.

84878733960	Joint timing and channel estimation for bandlimited long-code-based MC-DS-CDMA: A low-complexity near-optimal algorithm and the CRLB	Joint Timing and Channel Estimation (JTCE) for bandlimited long-code-aided Multi-Carrier Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (MC-DS-CDMA) systems is investigated. We establish the optimal multiuser timing and channel estimates for the uplink MC-DS-CDMA receiver by minimising a weighted least squares cost function with respect to K independent parameters, where K is the number of active users. A guided random search procedure known as Repeated Weighted Boosting Search (RWBS) is invoked for numerically solving this challenging multivariate optimisation problem, and thereby for producing near-optimal timing and channel estimates. The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the JTCE problem of interest is derived to benchmark the performance of the proposed RWBS based estimator. Quantitatively, for the scenario of K=10 users, E

84884126074	Projection method for multiple criteria group decision making with incomplete weight information in linguistic setting	Multiple criteria group decision making (MCGDM) problems have become a very active research field over the last decade. Many practical problems are often characterized by MCGDM. The aim of this paper is to develop a new approach for MCGDM problems with incomplete weight information in linguistic setting based on the projection method. Firstly, to reflect the reality accurately, a method to determine the weights of decision makers in linguistic setting is proposed by calculating the degree of similarity between 2-tuple linguistic decision matrix given by each decision maker and the average 2-tuple linguistic decision matrix. By using the weights of decision makers, all individual 2-tuple linguistic decision matrices are aggregated into a collective one. Then, to determine the weight vector of criteria, we establish a non-linear optimization model based on the basic ideal of the projection method, i.e., the optimal alternative should have the largest projection on the 2-tuple linguistic positive ideal solution (TLPIS). Calculate the 2-tuple linguistic projection of each alternative on the TLPIS and rank all the alternatives according to the 2-tuple linguistic projection value. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the calculation process of the proposed method, and the validity is verified by comparing the evaluation results of the proposed method with that of the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84893536303	A Simulation Study of the Magnetic Reconnections Between Closed Loops and Open Magnetic Fields Driven by Horizontal Flows on Solar Surface	Numerous observational events in the solar atmosphere (e.g., solar flares and jets) are attributed to the energy conversion due to magnetic reconnec- tions. Magnetic reconnections are also involved in a new scenario of solar wind origin to play a crucial role in opening the closed magnetic loop and releasing its mass into the open magnetic funnel. In this scenario, the closed magnetic loop moves towards the supergranular boundary by the supergranular convection, and collides with the open magnetic funnel there to trigger the magnetic reconnec- tion between each other. This work aims at studying the occurrence and effect of magnetic reconnection in this scenario in detail. The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulation is an important approach to investigate the mag- netic reconnection process in the solar atmosphere. A two-dimensional MHD numerical model has been established, and in combination with the stratified temperature and density distributions in the solar atmosphere, the numerical simulation on the process of magnetic reconnection of the closed magnetic loops driven by the horizontal flows with the open magnetic fields has been performed on the scale of supergranulation. Based on a quantitative analysis of the simula- tion result, it is suggested that the process of magnetic reconnection can really realize the mass release of closed magnetic loops, and further supply to the new open magnetic structures to produce upward mass flows. Our results provide a basis for the further modeling of solar wind origin. © 2014.

84896058455	Kalman filter used for carrier tracking algorithm based on matched maneuvering target model	For the problem then the traditional Kalman filter does not perform well enough when it is used in high-dynamic carrier tracking, an improved Kalman filter based on the matched maneuvering target model is proposed, which could achieve stable carrier synchronization under high-dynamic conditions. Compared with traditional algorithms, the proposed algorithm is more realistic, with high practical value, and a wide range of applications. Moreover, the tracking system uses a linear Kalman filter without matrix inverse operation, which has low computational complexity and is easy to implement in the real system. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is more suitable for the high-dynamic environment, which could significantly improve the tracking accuracy and reduce about 3 dB of the tracking threshold on signal-to-noise ratio.

84896856257	Some aggregation operators with intuitionistic trapezoid fuzzy linguistic information and their applications to multi-attribute group decision making	We study the multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems in which the attribute values provided by the decision makers take the form of intuitionistic trapezoid fuzzy linguistic (ITrFL) information considering the uncertainty and inaccuracy of input arguments. Some new aggregation operators called intuitionistic trapezoid fuzzy linguistic weighted average (ITrFLWA), intuitionistic trapezoid fuzzy linguistic ordered weighted average (ITrFLOWA) and intuitionistic trapezoid fuzzy linguistic hybrid weighted average (ITrFLHWA) operators are proposed at first. Then, we study some desirable properties of the proposed operators, such as monotonicity, idempotency, commutativity and boundedness. Next, two novel approaches based on the proposed operators are developed to solve MAGDM problems with intuitionistic trapezoid fuzzy linguistic information. Finally, an illustrative example of emergency logistics supplier selection is provided to verify the feasibility of the proposed approaches. © 2014 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.

84907853484	Analysis of learners' behaviors and learning outcomes in a massive open online course	This paper introduces a massive open online course (MOOC) on educational technology, and studies the factors that may influence learners' participation and performance in the MOOC. Students' learning records captured in the course management system and students' feedback collected from a questionnaire survey are explored. Regression analysis is adopted to examine the correlation among perceived learning experience, learning activities and learning outcomes; data mining is applied to optimize the correlation models. The findings suggest that learners' perceived usefulness rather than perceived ease of use of the MOOC, positively influences learners' use of the system, and consequentially, the learning outcome. In addition, learners' previous MOOC experience is not found to have a significant impact on their learning behavior and learning outcome in general. However, the performance of less active learners is found to be influenced by their prior MOOC experience.
