14344249941	Experiment and analyses of the adaptabilities of three wheat no-tillage drills on corn stubble in the areas with two ripe crops a year	No tillage planting is one of the important tasks in conservation tillage technique and the performance of no-tillage drills directly affects the realization of that technique. In order to select suitable no-tillage drills for areas with two ripe crops a year, suitability experiments have been done using JOHN DEERE 1590, 2BMD-12 No-Tillage Drill and 2BMFS-6/12 No-Tillage Drills in three different surface condition fields. The results of field test show that three kinds of no-tillage drills can all meet the Natl. standards of drill testing when the corn stalks were chopped and returned to the field. JOHN DEERE 1590 No-Tillage Drill could not plant under the condition of the corn stalks standing in the field. 2BMD-12 No-Tillage Drill and 2BMFS-6/12 No-Tillage Drill with Strip Rotary Tiller can both work under three different soil surface conditions. JOHN DEERE 1590 No-Tillage Drill does not adapt to be used in China because the price of the machine is too high, the plot of China is small, working time is short, therefore, the drill capacity could not be fully realized. It should base on the field surface condition, the size of plot and the economic status and so on to select adaptive wheat no-tillage drills for areas with two ripe crops a year.

29244474665	Controlled traffic conservation tillage using small to middle sized machinery in China	Research and farmers' experiences have demonstrated that reduced tillage helps maintain surface residues and provide substantial benefits in terms of water use efficiency, soil condition and productivity. However, the impact of field traffic and its influence on the soil when tillage is reduced or eliminated have been ignored, for small to middle-sized machinery are mostly used in Chinese agriculture. There is a need to study on wheel traffic impacts and to test controlled traffic farming system for Chinese conditions. This paper reports the five-year controlled traffic conservation tillage experiment in North China. Two trial plots (Spring Maize and Winter wheat) with four treatments and five replications were set up. The results indicated that controlled traffic conservation tillage could minimize the compaction of wheel traffic, make field operation timely and precisely, improve soil structure and increase soil moisture on crop zone which is beneficial to crop establishment and growth. With the accumulation of damages year after year, the impacts of random wheeling are becoming more notable. Heavier machinery appeared to compact soil to a greater depth, but even small tractors could compact the surface 10cm, critical to rainfall infiltration, to a remarkable degree. For the small-scaled controlled traffic system tested in this study, traffic lanes occupy about 20% of the land, but the yields were similar to those in the non-controlled traffic fields. Further test is needed for the long-term impacts of the traffic lanes on soil structure and crop yield and detailed analysis is necessary to develop a suitable controlled traffic farming system.

33846115610	Subsoiling effect and economic benefit under conservation tillage mode in Northern China	Conservation tillage, which can adapt to agricultural development of northern China well, is a new farming system, and through subsoiling, it can eliminate the soil compaction created by many years of no-till. Nowadays in the research field of subsoil technique, Chinese researchers have not conducted the profound researches on subsoiling effect and economic benefits under conservation tillage, what is more, they have not attached importance to the problems, such as doing harm to maize seedlings, increasing power consumption and reducing economic benefits, etc, which appear frequently during the process of subsoiling for maize. Based on the conservation tillage demonstration sites in northern China, the authors used more than ten years time and conducted a compositive experimental study of subsoiling effect under conservation tillage since 1993. The compositive experiment of subsoiling effect with three different tillage modes of traditional tillage, subsoiling with coverage and no-till with coverage mensurated data of soil bulk density, water contentt, water use efficiency and yield under different tillage modes, confirmed subsoiling time interval under conservation tillage, i. e., the tillage mode of four-year no-till with coverage plus one-year subsoiling, and the authors analyzed corresponding economic benefits of different tillage modes. The experimental results show, under the condition of conservation tillage, subsoiling every four years can solve soil compaction, keep high water use efficiency and yields of crops continuously and there is no need of subsoiling every year. The tillage mode of four-year no-till with coverage plus one-year subsoiling is capable of enhancing about 25% economic benefit compared to subsoiling with coverage (subsoiling every year). At the same time, according to the problems appeared in the process of maize subsoiling, a combined operation scheme of seeding and subsoiling for no-till maize is presented and the experimental result indicates this scheme can account for a serial of above problems existed in the process of maize subsoiling, promote the growth of maize, and increase the yield of maize. It is recommended that the combined operation technique of seeding and subsoiling for no-till maize should be extended in maize-producing areas of northern China.

The combine anti-blocking device that composed power chopping axle and the planting unit of double-disc opener was designed. Field performance test's result showed that the machine could accomplish many procedures, such as stubble chopping, furrow opening, seeds and fertilizer placement etc, in one pass, so the charge of operation could be decreased about 50%. The machine worked well for planting wheat into standing maize stubble and maize stubble shattered. The powered chopping axle resolved the anti-blockage problem that ahead of shank, and the double-disc opener unit reduced the blockage between planting units. Meanwhile the variations for seed depth reduced to 19.8% and 21.3% respectively. So this machine can be a good solution to no-till wheat planting in double cropping areas.

34548175511	Effect of three furrow openers for no-till wheat seeder on crop growth performance	The structure of furrow opener can affect the power consumption and the wheat early growth. To overcome those problems, three furrow openers, which include the tine opener, the single-disc opener and the rotary opener were studied in the field in Beijing. The soil disturbance, the wheat early growth and the yield were measured and analyzed. The results showed that the yield of different furrow openers were not different statistically (p=0.05), but the different furrow openers could form different seedbed, so it can affect the seed germination, the wheat early growth. The rotary opener can form the loose groove, compared with the tine opener and the single-disc opener, the counts of the adventitious root are the most, but the soil disturbance is bigger, up to 40%-60%, so the power consumption is the highest. The lowest counts of the adventitious root and single plant weight occurred on the condition of single-disc opener, but the soil disturbance is the lowest, with about 10%-50%. So the different furrow openers can adapt to the different areas, people should design and select the suitable furrow openers based on the local characteristics of conservation tillage.

77954293145	Reconstruction and optimal design of driving dentate disc of D-bale knotter based on reverse engineering	Driving dentate disc is the power source of mechanical bale knotter. The bale knotters used in domestic mostly depend on imports and the knotters could not meet the requirements of high-efficient straw belting due to the unstable working status caused by un-smooth cam working surface of driving dentate disc and discontent with static equilibrium. This paper took the D-twine knotter as the research objective and optimal designed a weight driving dentate disc with the features of high surface quality and stable transmission based on the theory of reverse engineering. Through the analysis of the working principle of D-twine knotter, the paper reconstructed the 3D driving dentate disc and optimized its surface and structure with the Imageware and Pro/E software. The analysis of multi-surface continuity and surface contour of driving dentate disc showed that after the optimization of weight driving dentate disc, its surface position deviation and change rate of tangent were 0.0013-0.0037 mm and 0.1393°-0.1400°, respectively. The change of surface curvature was continuous and the chord deviation was 0.100 mm, indicating the disc surface met the requirements of A-class surface. Furthermore, the parts matched with disc surface worked steadily, which ensured the operation order in straw-belting. The new center of the disc was about (2.87, 0, 0) mm, which reached the requirements of static equilibrium and could meet the requirements of high-speed belting in heavy straw cover fields in harvest season in China.

The effects of different tillage treatments on soil water stable aggregates, soil bulk density, soil water content, soil temperature and crop growth were studied. The results showed that, no-till and subsoiling increased the content of soil water stable aggregates with a diameter larger than 0.25 mm at 0-10 cm and 10-30 cm soil layer, respectively. While the results of no-till and conventional tillage was not obvious. The regulating effects in soil bulk density were increased with the increase of the depth of soil layer. Rotary tillage and subsoiling could reduce the content of soil bulk density at 0-10 cm and 10-30 cm soil layer, respectively. The soil bulk density of no-till was the biggest at 0-20 cm soil layer, and there were no significant differences observed among the conventional tillage, rotary tillage and no-tillage under 20 cm soil layer. The preserve soil moisture ability of subsoiling was higher than others. Compared with subsoiling, the soil moisture content of rotary tillage, plowing tillage and no-tillage was reduced by 2.5%, 1.6%, 0.4%, respectively. The range of soil temperature of plowing tillage was the greatest with the change of air temperature, while the range and daily mean soil temperature of no-till was the least. Subsoiling promoted the yield of winter wheat and the growth of crops in the initial stage, while no-till had a better result at a later stage.

49849088575	Effects of tillage and traffic on crop production in dryland farming systems: II. Long-term simulation of crop production using the PERFECT model	Soil water conservation is critical to long-term crop production in dryland cropping areas in Northeast Australia. Many field studies have shown the benefits of controlled traffic and zero tillage in terms of runoff and soil erosion reduction, soil moisture retention and crop yield improvement. However, there is lack of understanding of the long-term effect of the combination of controlled traffic and zero tillage practices, as compared with other tillage and traffic management practices. In this study, a modeling approach was used to estimate the long-term effect of tillage, traffic, crop rotation and type, and soil management practices in a heavy clay soil. The PERFECT soil-crop simulation model was calibrated with data from a 5-year field experiment in Northeast Australia in terms of runoff, available soil water and crop yield; the procedure and outcomes of this calibration were given in a previous contribution. Three cropping systems with different tillage and traffic treatments were simulated with the model over a 44-year-period using archived weather data. Results showed higher runoff, and lower soil moisture and crop production with conventional tillage and accompanying field traffic than with controlled traffic and zero tillage. The effect of traffic is greater than the effect of tillage over the long-term. The best traffic, tillage and crop management system was controlled traffic zero tillage in a high crop intensity rotation, and the worst was conventional traffic and stubble mulch with continuous wheat. Increased water infiltration and reduced runoff under controlled traffic resulted in more available soil water and higher crop yield under opportunity cropping systems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

49849093530	Effects of tillage and traffic on crop production in dryland farming systems: I. Evaluation of PERFECT soil-crop simulation model	Agricultural production systems are complex involving variability in climate, soil, crop, tillage management and interactions between these components. The traditional experimental approach has played an important role in studying crop production systems, but isolation of these factors in experimental studies is difficult and time consuming. Computer simulation models are useful in exploring these interactions and provide a valuable tool to test and further our understanding of the behavior of soil-crop systems without repeating experimentation. Productivity erosion and runoff functions to evaluate conservation techniques (PERFECT) is one of the soil-crop models that integrate the dynamics of soil, tillage and crop processes at a daily resolution. This study had two major objectives. The first was to calibrate the use of the PERFECT soil-crop simulation model to simulate soil and crop responses to changes of traffic and tillage management. The second was to explore the interactions between traffic, tillage, soil and crop, and provide insight to the long-term effects of improved soil management and crop rotation options. This contribution covers only the first objective, and the second will be covered in a subsequent contribution. Data were obtained from field experiments on a vertisol in Southeast Queensland, Australia which had controlled traffic and tillage treatments for the previous 5 years. Input data for the simulation model included daily weather, runoff, plant available water capacity, and soil hydraulic properties, cropping systems, and traffic and tillage management. After model calibration, predicted and measured total runoffs for the 5-year period were similar. Values of root mean square error (RMSE) for daily runoff ranged from 5.7 to 9.2 mm, which were similar to those reported in literature. The model explained 75-95% of variations of daily, monthly and annual runoff, 70-84% of the variation in total available soil water, and 85% of the variation in yield. The results showed that the PERFECT daily soil-crop simulation model could be used to generate meaningful predictions of the interactions between crop, soil and water under different tillage and traffic systems. Ranking of management systems in order of decreasing merit for runoff, available soil water and crop yield was (1) controlled traffic zero tillage, (2) controlled traffic stubble mulch, (3) wheeled zero tillage, and (4) wheeled stubble mulch. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The soil bin experimentation showed that the mechanism has a good ability to cut corn rootstalks, when the running speed is 0.75 km/h, the rotor speed is 150 r/min and the blade-installation is ZH2. The experimentation for choosing spindle-harnesses showed that the second spindle harness which has better cutting ability and lower power consumption is the best choice.

53649089627	Development of conservation tillage	Human beings are facing great challenges today on global warming, resources shortage, land degradation and population expansion. The development of CT (conservation tillage) should have big help to reply the challenges and promote sustainable agriculture forward. CT has become the major tillage method in American and Australian continents, also has development in European, Asian and African continents with different levels. The agronomy study of CT in China had started in early 60' last century, but the mechanized CT was started later. From 1991, quite a few of light as well power driven no-till planters, together with many CT field technologies have been created, thus, a sound base for CT demonstration and extension was formed.

55649107124	Design of ridge reshaping and intertillage fertilizer applicator	Based on the current situation that corn intertillage machinery can not work in straw mulching farmlands in northeast of China, the ridge reshaping and intertillage fertilizer applicator was designed. The rotary tillage device was used to crush the residue and weed in the furrow, arid disperse soil on both sides of the ridge. Meanwhile, fertilizer was applied. The ridge reshaping wheel finished ridge repair, covering soil and compaction. The results show that the kind of agricultural machinery has high performance of residue crushing and anti-blocking capacity. The reshaping and fertilizing results meet the design demand. The machine can meet needs of application in straw mulching farmlands in northeast of China.

54749145907	Design and experiment on a wedge shaped no-tillage opener	A wedge-shaped no-tillage opener consisting of sharp front knife edge and pedestal with lateral wings has been designed. The front knife is connected with the pedestal by means of inner bolts and can be conveniently changed when it is abraded. Tests of resistance and power consumption are carried out in the field covered with maize straw. Test results show that the wedged-shaped no-tillage opener can reduce the surface soil disturbance to between 15% and 25%, and reduce the straw coverage rate by 10%-20%, so it can satisfy the requirement of no-tillage sowing. In comparison to the tine opener, it has the advantages that the soil bulk density is decreased significantly, the resistance and the fuel consumption are reduced by 13.2% and 15% separately when the depth of furrow opening is 10 cm, thus reducing the power consumption of tractor. So the wedged-shaped no-tillage opener solves the problem of high resistance and power consumption when the depth of furrow opening is 10 cm, and creates the loose seedbed, and which has important significance to the popularization and application of no-tillage seeders in China.

57349156241	Traffic and tillage effects on runoff and soil loss on the Loess Plateau of northern China	This paper reports the outcome of 5 years of field plot runoff monitoring, 2 years of water erosion measurement, and a rainfall simulation experiment on moderately sloping farmland on the loess plateau of north-west China. The objective was to test different conservation tillage systems compared with the control treatment, conventional mouldboard plough practice (CK). Tillage, residue cover, and compaction effects were assessed in terms of runoff and soil erosion. Results from the runoff plots showed that conservation tillage, with more residue cover, less compaction, and less soil disturbance, could substantially reduce runoff and soil erosion compared with the control. No tillage with residue cover and no compaction produced the least runoff and soil erosion. Compared with the control, it reduced runoff and soil erosion by about 40% and 80%, respectively. At the start of the experiment, residue cover appeared to be the most important factor affecting soil and water conservation, particularly when antecedent soil moisture was limited. With the accumulation of tractor wheeling effects over the course of the experiment, soil compaction appeared to become a more important factor affecting runoff. Rainfall simulation was then used to assess the effect of non-inverting surface tillage and different levels of residue cover and wheel compaction on infiltration and runoff. This confirmed that wheel compaction effects could be greater than those of tillage and residue cover, at least under the 82.5mm/h rainfall rate produced by the simulator. The wheeling effect was particularly large when the treatment was applied to wet soil, and severe even after wheeling by small tractors. © CSIRO 2008.

57349160712	Spring wheat performance and water use efficiency on permanent raised beds in arid northwest China	Permanent raised beds have been proposed as a more productive and water-efficient alternative to the conventional system of flat, flood-irrigated bays for planting narrow-spaced crops in arid north-west China. Data from a field experiment (2005-2007) conducted in the Hexi Corridor at Zhangye, Gansu Province, China, were used to compared the effects of traditional tillage (TT), zero tillage (ZT), and permanent raised beds (PRB) on crop growth, yield, and water use in a spring wheat monoculture. The results show that PRB significantly (P<0.05) increased soil water content to 0.30m depth by 7.2-10.7% and soil temperature to 0.05m depth by 0.2-0.9°C during the wheat-growing period relative to TT and ZT treatments. Bulk density in 0-0.10m soil layer under PRB was also 5.8% less than for flat planting treatments. Mean wheat yields over 3 years on PRB plots were slightly greater and furrow irrigation in permanent beds was particularly effective in increasing irrigation water use efficiency (∼18%), compared with TT and ZT treatments. This increase in water use efficiency is of considerable importance for these arid areas where irrigation water resources are scarce. © CSIRO 2008.

57349182781	Traffic and tillage effects on wheat production on the Loess Plateau of China: 2. Soil physical properties	Controlled traffic zero and minimum tillage management with residue cover has been proposed as a solution to erosion and other soil degradation challenges to the sustainability of dryland farming on the Loess Plateau of China. This was assessed between 1998 and 2007 in a field experiment involving a conventional tillage treatment, and 2 controlled traffic treatments, no tillage and shallow tillage, with full straw cover in both cases. This paper reports the soil physical properties after 9 years of dryland wheat production under these treatments, and the substantial improvements seen in soils under controlled traffic. Compared with conventional tillage, controlled traffic significantly reduced soil bulk density in the 0-0.15m soil layer, and increased total porosity in the 0-0.60m soil layer, where macroporosity (>60μm) and mesoporosity (0.2-60μm) increased at the expense of microporosity (<0.2μm). Readily available water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity were greater in controlled traffic treatments. Controlled traffic farming appears to be an improvement on current farming systems on the Loess Plateau, and valuable for the sustainable development agriculture in this region. © CSIRO 2008.

57349191829	Traffic and tillage effects on wheat production on the Loess Plateau of China: 1. Crop yield and SOM	Challenges for dryland farming on the Loess Plateau of China are continuous nutrient loss, low soil organic matter and crop yield, and soil degradation. Controlled traffic, combined with zero or minimum tillage and residue cover, has been proposed to improve soil structure and crop yield. From 1998 to 2006, we conducted a field experiment comparing soil organic matter and wheat productivity between controlled traffic and conventional tillage farming systems. The field experiment was conducted using 2 controlled traffic treatments (zero tillage with residue cover and no compaction, shallow tillage with residue cover and no compaction) and a conventional tillage treatment. Results showed that controlled traffic treatments significantly increased soil organic matter and microbial biomass in the 0-0.30m soil profile. Controlled traffic with zero tillage significantly increased total N in the 0-0.05m soil profile. The mean yield over 8 years of controlled traffic treatments was >10% greater than that of conventional tillage. Controlled traffic farming appears to be a solution to the cropping problems faced on the Loess Plateau of China. © CSIRO 2008.

The results show that, controlled traffic conservation tillage can decrease soil bulk density 6.8% in 0-20 cm layer and soil cone index 31.5% in 0-30 cm layer, increase soil total porosity 4.6% in 0-40 cm layer and soil moisture in 1 m soil depth, compared with conventional tillage. Even 20% of field was occupied by traffic lane, controlled traffic conservation tillage technique also can increase winter wheat yield 10.8%. In a word, controlled traffic conservation tillage is an effective tillage system to decrease soil compaction, improve soil construction, and increase wheat yield.

Combing of row-followed operation to sheer off corn stubble by using wheel tracks and power driven chopping anti-blocking mechanism, it can be used to solve the problem of no-till wheat planting in corn residue. Field test shows that the planter has a good performance of trafficability with the ratio of sheering off corn stubble 85% and anti-blocking capacity, thus to finish wheat and maize no-till planting. The variation coefficient of seed depth was 19.4% and 23.4% for wheat and maize, respectively. This machine can implement both wheat and maize no-till planting. Therefore, this planter can be a good solution to current problems in no-till planting in annual two-crop region of northern China.

66149158570	Effects of 10 years of conservation tillage on soil properties and productivity in the farming-pastoral ecotone of Inner Mongolia, China	Soil degradation and subsequent yield decline are the main factors limiting further development of agriculture on the farming-pastoral transition zone of China. A 10-year field experiment was conducted in Inner Mongolia to compare the long-term effects of no-tillage with straw cover (NT), subsoiling with straw cover (ST), rototilling with straw cover (RT) and traditional tillage (TT) using ploughs on soil properties and productivity in a spring wheat-oat cropping system. Long-term conservation tillage increased soil organic matter in the top 20 cm by 21.4%, total N by 31.8% and Olsen's P by 34.5% in the 0-5 cm layer compared to traditional tillage. Mean percentage of macro-aggregates (>0.25 mm, +20%) and macroporosity (>60 μm, +52.1%) also improved significantly in the 0-30 cm soil layer (P < 0.05). The largest yield improvements coupled with greatest water use efficiency (WUE) were achieved by no-tillage with straw cover. Ten-year mean crop yields increased by 14.0% and WUE improved by 13.5% compared to traditional tillage due to greater soil moisture and improved soil physical and chemical status. These improvements in soil properties and productivity are of considerable importance for the seriously degraded soils in semiarid Inner Mongolia, as well as for food security, sustainable agriculture and carbon storage in the farming-pasture transition regions of China. © 2009 British Society of Soil Science.

67349168808	Functional relationships between soil water infiltration and wheeling and rainfall energy	Surface seal formation and subsoil compaction are two important factors of soil structural degradation, both of which reduce infiltration and increase surface runoff. Surface sealing has traditionally been related to rainfall energy; however, there has been very limited work on characterizing subsoil degradation resulting from wheeling energy imposed by agricultural machinery traffic. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that wheeling energy, either by itself or in combination with rainfall energy, would be a useful predictor of subsequent soil structural degradation. Field experiments were conducted on a heavy clay soil site in South-east Queensland, Australia which had controlled traffic and conservation tillage treatments for the previous 5 years. Soil was compacted with different axle load and wheel slips, and wheeling energy was calculated from wheel slip and rolling resistance. Simulated rain was applied at different intensities with a portable rainfall simulator. Runoff was measured with a tipping bucket flow meter, and infiltration parameters and the corresponding curve number was determined. The results showed that when soil was protected by residue cover, infiltration and runoff was governed by subsoil compaction. Under this condition, steady state infiltration rate decreased and curve number increased with increasing wheeling energy, but the constant values of steady infiltration rate (14.5 mm h

By taking the filed photos as the research objectives, this system was developed through VC+ + programming tools. Straws were detected by combining the texture features and BP neural network. Selection standard of learning samples for input nodes was constructed based on the entropy in the system. Artificial simulation and field testing indicated that the new measuring system could detect over 90% of the straws in the field and control the counting error of residue cover rate under 5%. Compared with the traditional manual measuring, the measuring efficiency in the new system could be improved by 50-120 times.

Visual guidance system was studied to guide the machine working in between the stubble rows thus to solve the blockage problem in standing stubble conditions. The maize stubble rows were detected by image processing and the saturation of the field image was selected to segment the dry stubble and soil surface background. By comparing different methods of determining threshold, the iterative method was proved to be the most effective to segment the image automatically. The improved Hough transform was used to detect the inter-row line and the stubble row line to guide the machine. The experiments with large number of field images showed that the algorithm proposed can obtain the target navigation path rapidly within 0.1 s and accurately for most conditions of standing stubble covered field.

67650486112	Soil structure and crop performance after 10 years of controlled traffic and traditional tillage cropping in the dryland loess plateau in China	Soil degradation and the accompanying decline in crop yields are the main limiting factors for the further development of agriculture on the Chinese Loess Plateau. A 10-year experiment was conducted in Linfen on the Loess Plateau to assess the potential benefits of controlled traffic on agricultural production. In this region, long-term traditional ploughing with straw removal has resulted in a decline of soil productivity and poor soil structure. Several treatments were compared: controlled traffic with no-tillage and straw cover (NTSC), controlled traffic with shallow tillage and straw cover, and traditional tillage (TT) in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) monoculture. Results show clear benefits of controlled traffic farming. Winter wheat growth in ploughed plots was much slower than in controlled traffic plots. Mean yield from 1998 to 2007 was 11.2% lower for traditional tillage than for controlled traffic plots. The best results were achieved by a no-tillage straw cover and controlled traffic system (NTSC), which resulted in the greatest benefits to soil structure after 10 years. The NTSC significantly improved soil organic matter content in the top 30 cm by 27.2%, total N by 10.8%, and available P (top 10 cm) by 92.3% compared with TT. Aeration (>60 μm) and capillary porosity (2-60 μm) were 155.0% and 16.1% greater, respectively, in NTSC plots than in TT plots. Consequently, for NTSC, final water infiltration rates were 67.4% greater than for TT, whereas water content in the top 130 cm was 14.9% higher than in TT, respectively. We conclude therefore that controlled traffic combined with no-tillage and straw cover is a valuable system for restoring soil productivity and quality of seriously degraded soils on the Loess Plateau for the sustainable development of agriculture in dryland China. © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

Three pieces of foldable shields were installed to reduce the drift of the chemicals. As most of the weeds are perennial in the area and can hardly be eliminated by chemical spraying, and also some annual weeds can not be simply cut off by mechanical cultivator, this sprayer-cultivator-combined weeder could function as a manner of integrated weed control along the whole growing period of wheat and maize. Field experiments show that the chemical and mechanical combined treatment managed a significantly better weed-control performance (97.3%) which was higher than either spraying treatment (94.6%) or cultivating treatment (89.2%). That means under permanent raised bed system chemical sprayer and mechanical cultivator combined mode is the optimum pattern to get effective weeds control.

69249213671	Influence of conservation tillage practices on soil properties and crop yields for maize and wheat cultivation in Beijing, China	Conservation tillage is becoming increasingly attractive to farmers because it involves lower production costs than does conventional tillage. The long-term effects of sub-soiling tillage (ST), no tillage (NT), and conventional tillage (CT) on soil properties and crop yields were investigated over an 8-year period (200007). The study was conducted in a 2-crop-a-year region (Daxing) and a 1-crop-a-year region (Changping) of the Beijing area in China. At 00.30m soil depth, water stability of macro-aggregates (>0.25mm) was much greater for ST (22.1%) and NT (12.0%) than for CT in Daxing, and the improvements in Changping were 18.9% and 9.5%, respectively. ST and NT significantly (P<0.05) improved aeration porosity by 14.5% and 10.6%, respectively, at Daxing and by 17.0% and 8.6% at Changping compared with CT treatment. Soil bulk density after 8 years was 0.81.5% lower in ST and NT treatments than in CT at both sites. Soil organic matter and available N and P followed the same order ST≈NT>CT at both sites. Consequently, crop yields in ST and NT plots were higher than in CT plots due to improved soil physical and chemical properties. Within the conservation tillage treatments, despite similar economic benefit, the effects on crop yields for ST were better than for NT. Mean (200007) crop yields for ST were 0.2% and 1.5% higher than for NT at Daxing and Changping, respectively. We therefore conclude that ST is the most suitable conservation tillage practice for annual 2-crop-a-year and 1-crop-a-year regions in the Beijing area. © CSIRO 2009.

70349154297	Soil physical properties and infiltration after long-term no-tillage and ploughing on the Chinese Loess Plateau	Water is the most limiting factor for crop production in dryland farming. A better understanding of the long-term impact of tillage and residue management systems on soil structure and water infiltration is necessary for the further development of conservation tillage practice to improve water use efficiency. The objectives of this study were to assess the influence of no-till with residue retention (NT) and conventional (plough) tillage with residue removal (CT) on soil properties and soil water transmission characteristics in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) monoculture system in Shanxi, on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Soil physical parameter measurements were made in the top 30 cm depth in September 2007 after 16 years under the two tillage treatments. Compared with CT treatment, NT significantly (P < 0.05) reduced soil bulk density (7.1%) in the 20-30 cm soil layer, and increased macroporosity (> 60 um, 17.0%) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (249%) in the 15-30 cm soil layer. There were no significant differences in these soil physical properties between tillage systems in the 0-15 cm layer. In addition, plant available water and water infiltration rate were greater in the NT treatment. The improved soil quality parameters and water infiltration from this long-term experiment indicate that no-tillage with residue retention is a promising farming system for the dryland farming areas of northern China. © The Royal Society of New Zealand 2009.

Furthermore, the key parameters for powered-chain, chain finger and knife type opener were determined based on the analyses of the movement of anti-blocking mechanism. The field experiment showed that the powered-chain anti-blocking mechanism could solve the residue blocking effectively, so as to ensure the passing of wheat no-till planter. Through real-time clearing of corn residues before the knife type opener, 12.3% of opening force was decreased. Compared with the strip roto-tilling wheat planter, the powered-chain wheat no-till planter could not only seed and fertilize at the suitable depths, but also decrease soil disturbance and fuel consumption by 66.4% and 8.07%, respectively, which indicates that this new planter can meet the requirements of agronomy in North China plain.

The 2BML2 ridge-till and no-till planter was been designed on the base of low-bandwidth rotary tillage. Field test of fuel consumption was carried through. The result showed: when the parameters of openers, cover and press disks are invariable, the depth of rotary till is the most important factor, and the width of rotary is the second one, then is the approaching speed; in the range of fitness, with increase of the speed, the quantity of consumption becomes lower; compared to the 2BML2 planter, the fuel consumption in traditional tillage would increase more than 32%. A fuel consumption model was obtained through the field testing, which can calculate the fuel consumption conveniently according to actual condition and make for selecting appropriate work parameters and designing similar type planter.

As a part of the whole package of research program, this paper designed a multifunctional machine to control the weeds which are frequently occurring under Permanent Raised Bed System in the project. This machine featured the combined configurations of chemical sprayer and mechanical cultivator, which were set up on a three-section foldable frame and could be applied individually or collaboratively as to the specific requirement. Three pieces of foldable shields were installed to reduce the drift of the chemicals. Field experiments showed that the chemical and mechanical combined treatment managed a significantly better weed eliminated rate (WER) of 97.3% which was higher than either single spraying treatment or mechanical cultivating treatment. Since most of the weeds are perennial in the area and can hardly be eliminated by chemical spraying, and also some annual weeds can not be simply cut off with mechanical cultivator, this sprayer-cultivator-combined weeder could be a way of Integrated Weed Control along the whole growing period of wheat and maize.

76849100554	Crop performance as affected by three opening configurations for no-till seeder in annual double cropping regions of northern China	The furrow opening configuration used by no-till seeders can have a major effect on crop emergence in conservation tillage systems. This is particularly important in annual double-cropping regions (winter wheat and summer maize) of northern China where large volumes of residue remain on the soil surface after maize harvesting. This problem has been investigated using 3 different opening configurations for no-till wheat seeding near Beijing in 2004-05 and 2005-06, and assessing performance in terms of soil disturbance, residue cover index, soil cone index, fuel consumption, winter wheat emergence, plant growth, and subsequent yield. In this cropping system, the single-disc opening configuration significantly decreased mean soil disturbance and increased residue cover index compared with the combined strip-chop and strip-till opening configurations, but winter wheat emergence was 6-9% less, probably due to greater levels of residue cover and greater seed zone soil cone index. Winter wheat growth after seeding in combined strip-chop and strip-till seeded plots was faster than that in single-disc seeded plots and mean yield was greater. The most suitable furrow opening configuration in heavy residue cover conditions appeared to be the strip-chop one, which can provide similar crop performance with marginally better fuel economy than the strip-till opening configuration. These results should be seen as preliminary, but they are still valuable for the design and selection of no-till wheat seeders for double cropping in this region of China. © 2009 CSIRO.

The effect of CTCT on operation resistance force was researched in annual two crops region in Northern China. The rolling resistance, opener resistance and total draft between controlled and non-controlled traffic treatments were analyzed. In subsoiling, wheat and maize planting, compared with non-controlled traffic with conservation tillage, CTCT total draft reduced by 14.6%, 13.3% and 13.3%, rolling resistance reduced by 26.9%, 21.9% and 19.7%, averaging 22.9%, working resistance reduced by 7.5%, 7.2% and 12.4%, averaging 8.8%. Opener resistance reduced 22.0% averagely in controlled traffic treatments than that in non-controlled traffic treatments. As the resistance decreased, fuel consumption in controlled traffic treatment reduced by 17.6%, 12.4% and 9.1% in three operations. Results showed that controlled traffic conservation tillage reduces agricultural machine working resistance and fuel consumption in field operation.

77955077611	The adoption of conservation tillage in China	Conservation tillage (CT) has been recognized as an advanced agricultural technology that may reduce drought and improve the physical condition of soils worldwide. An increase in water infiltration and a reduction in water and wind erosion can be achieved through the use of no-tillage, minimum tillage, and residue cover. In China, CT research started with support from the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), China and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research in 1992. By the end of 1990s, CT research had expanded across China and achieved several important results. In 1999, MOA established the Conservation Tillage Research Centre (CTRC) to lead the national CT research programs in China, and since 2002 some CT demonstration projects have been established in northern China. By the end of 2008, CT has been demonstrated in 226 national and 365 provincial demonstration counties, covering more than 3 Mha. The CTRC of the MOA has established 10 sites within those counties to monitor project results. Some sites have shown consistently that the use of CT resulted in higher yields and net incomes, reduced soil erosion, and improved soil conditions. CT has been widely accepted in China and will be further adopted over wider areas as the development and highbred of indigenous no-tillage seeders. © 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.

77958490593	Effects of wide-ridge and narrow-row no-till cultivation on soil water and maize yield	To resolve the problems faced while no-till seeding on the original ridge and to avoid instability of planter, the furrow was covered by soil to form wide-ridge. The field experiment was conducted at Sujiatun in Liaoning Province in 2007-2009, and the effects of wide-ridge with wide-narrow row no-till cultivation on soil bulk density, soil water content, maize growth and water use efficiency were also studied. The results indicated that wide-ridge with wide-narrow row no-till seeding could increase the capacity of water storage and water content by 9.39%-11.03% in the seeding stage. Compared with average ridge row, the population structure was improved effectively under wide-ridge with wide-narrow row no-till cultivation. From the study it was also found that the growth of individual plants was better, dry matter accumulation and LAI were enhanced. The yield was increased by 6.70%-9.49%, and the soil water use efficiency was improved by 4.96%-8.56%. It was a perfect planting mode for conservation tillage in the northeast of China.

78649591280	Effect of ridge tillage, no-tillage, and conventional tillage on soil temperature, water use, and crop performance in cold and semi-arid areas in Northeast China	In cold and semi-arid Northeast China, insufficient soil accumulative temperature and low water use efficiency (WUE) are the limiting factors for the further development of agriculture. Ridge tillage (RT) has been proposed to improve soil temperature and water conservation. Data from a 3-year field experiment conducted at two locations (Sujiatun and Lanxi) in Northeast China were used to compare RT, no-tillage (NT), and conventional tillage (CT) in a spring maize cropping system. At both sites, RT and NT significantly (P<0.05) increased mean soil temperature to 0.10m depth, relative to CT, by 0.7-2.4°C in the cold season during the spring maize growing stage. Mean soil moisture depletion in the RT treatment was greater by 1.2-4.1% (Sujiatun) and 0.6-3.0% (Lanxi) than in NT and CT, respectively. Mean maize yields over 3 years for RT were ∼9.9% greater than for CT, whereas the yield advantage in the NT treatment was only slight. In Sujiatun, WUE was 8.0% and 8.6% greater under RT than under NT and CT, respectively, and in Lanxi, WUE was 7.7% and 9.6% greater under RT than NT and CT. Ridge tillage is recommended to the farmers to obtain higher crop yield and WUE in Northeast China. © CSIRO 2010.

To get strength checking and comparative analysis, ANSYS software was adopted to analyze the cutters. The stress of the cutters applied was calculated based on pure-shear and two-wedge models, and got the stress pattern and deformed shape. The results showed that all of these cutters' strength met the demand, and deformed shape was very small. With AHP and effect coefficient methods, and using theoretical resistance, operation fuel consumption and soil moisture as evaluation indexes, V-shaped cutter was found to be the most suitable considering the integrated benefits.

79953025569	Soil properties and crop yields after 11 years of no tillage farming in wheat-maize cropping system in North China Plain	Soil deterioration and the accompanying decline in crop yields are the main factors limiting the further development of agriculture in North China Plain. The long-term effects of no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) on soil properties and crop yields were investigated in annual double cropping system of winter wheat-summer maize in the Gaocheng in Hebei, North China Plain over a 11-year period (1998-2009). Long-term NT significantly (P< 0.05) increased soil organic matter, available N and P in the top 10. cm by 16.1%, 31.0% and 29.6% as compared to CT treatment. Mean percentage of macro-aggregates (>0.25. mm, +8.1%) and macroporosity (>60. μm, +43.3%) was also enhanced statistically (P< 0.05) in the 0-30. cm soil layer. Winter wheat and summer maize yields tended to be 3.5% and 1.4% higher under NT than under CT, particularly in the dry years, suggesting that the change in soil physical properties, soil fertility and moisture has provided a better environment for crop development. These improvements in soil properties and yields are of considerable importance for the degraded soils in semiarid North China Plain, as well as for food security, sustainable agriculture and carbon storage in the annual double cropping areas of China. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84860626472	Experimental research on performance of different knotter driving pulleys	As a key part of the knotter, knotter driving pulley is the total power source of the knotter used on briquetters. The parameters of knotter driving pulley are main factors for affecting the knotting rate. Two kinds of CTRC knotters (CTRC_I and CTRC_II) were designed to solve the present knotting problems, which including mis-clipping, mis-cutting and mis-tripping off the twine. CTRC_I was composed of CTRC basal part and reversed "9" type cam block, while CTRC_II was composed of CTRC basal part and arc-tangent type cam block. The comparison was carried out among CTRC_I, CTRC_II and New Holland knotter driving pulleys indoor. The results showed that the stable knotting rate of CTRC_I pulley (90.0%) was significant higher than that of New Holland (83.5%) and CTRC_II (65.0%) types of pulleys. The best stable knotting rate was obtained under three combinations: New Holland with sisal twine, CTRC_I with polypropylene twine and CTRC_I with sisal twine and was 22.7%~53.5% higher than the other three combinations. During the experiments, mean maximum pull tension was got by the CTRC_II type pulley, while the minimum pull tension was got by the CTRC_I type pulley. At last, the knot quality was the highest for CTRC_I pulley while the twine dosage was also largest for it in comparison with the CTRC_II and New Holland pulleys. Meanwhile, the twine dosage was the largest at 70 r/min (99.5 mm) and smallest at 40 r/min (94.8 mm). Finally, the knotting performance of CTRC_I and New Holland pulleys were proved to be better than CTRC_II pulley by comprehensive benefit analysis through combining the methods of analytic hierarchy process and effect coefficient. Combination of the CTRC_I pulley and polypropylene rope was the best operating mode among the six different combinations.

84862944743	Influence of no tillage controlled traffic system on soil physical properties in double cropping area of North China plain	An experiment was conducted to determine the effects of tillage on soil properties in the field of maize (Zea mays L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) annual double cropping region in North China Plain. Measurements were made following six years (2005 to 2010) of three tillage treatments; no till with controlled traffic (NTCT), no till random trafficking (NTRT) and conventional tillage (CT) on a silt loam according to the USDA texture classification system soil in Daxing district, which lies in the suburb of Beijing. Long term no till with controlled traffic significantly (P < 0.05) increased macroaggregates, infiltration rate, soil moisture, together with reductions in soil bulk density, soil compaction in different layers compared with the no till random traffic and traditional mould board tillage treatment currently used in this region. Consequently, mean winter wheat and summer maize yields for the NTCT treatment were improved by 2.8 and 7.1% when compared with the soils under no till random traffic, while huge improvement was found when it was compared with conventional ploughing management (4.2 and 12.08% for wheat and maize, respectively). The long-term experiment demonstrated that notillage controlled traffic with residues retained, offers a potentially significant improvement over the current farming systems in annual double cropping areas of North China Plain. © 2012 Academic Journals.

84867757910	Seed Zone Properties and Crop Performance as Affected by Three No-Till Seeders for Permanent Raised Beds in Arid Northwest China	The no-till seeders of various soil opener configurations have been shown to produce various soil physical responses in relation to soil and climate conditions, thus affecting crop performance in permanent raised beds (PRB) systems. This is particularly important in arid Northwest China where large volumes of residue are retained on the soil surface after harvest. In Zhangye, Gansu Province, China, a field trial assessed the effects of three typical (powered-chopper, powered-cutter and powered-disc) PRB no-till seeders and one traditional seeder on soil disturbance, residue cover index, bulk density, fuel consumption, plant growth, and subsequent yield. In general, seedbed conditions and crop performance for PRB no-till seeders seeded plots were better than for traditional seeded plots. In PRB cropping system, the powered-chopper seeder decreased mean soil disturbance and increased residue cover index compared to powered-disc and -cutter seeders. However, the results indicated that soil bulk density was 2.3-4.8% higher, soil temperature was 0.2-0.6°C lower, and spring wheat emergence was 3.2-4.7% less. This was attributed to greater levels of residue cover and firmer seedbeds. Spring maize and wheat performance in the powered-cutter and -disc treatments was better (non-significant) than powered-chopper treatment. So powered disc no-till seeder, which generally provided the best planting condition and the highest yield, appeared to be the suitable seeder in heavy residue cover conditions. Considering the precision requirements for soil disturbance and residue cover, the powered strip-chopping no-till seeder could be a suitable option for PRB cropping system in Northwest China. Although these results are preliminary, they are still valuable for the design and selection of no-till seeders for PRB cropping systems in arid Northwest China. © 2012 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

The effects of permanent raised beds (PRB), no-till (NT) and traditional tillage (TT) on soil structure and yield were investigated in a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) - maize (Zea mays L.) cropping system from 2004 to 2009 in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province, China. PRB and NT had more macro-aggregates (>0.25mm, +2.7%), a better distribution of pore size classes and improved hydraulic conductivity, whereas TT soils were dominated by micro-aggregates and micro-porosity. In PRB, soil bulk density decreased significantly by 6.3 and 7.0% for the 0- to 10-cm and 20- to 30-cm depths relative to TT. The PRB mean crop yields increased by 4.2% and water use efficiency improved by 21.3% compared with TT because of greater soil moisture and improved soil physical and chemical status. These improvements in soil properties, yield and water use are of considerable importance for soil regeneration, food security and sustainable agriculture in arid regions, such as north-western China. © 2012 British Society of Soil Science.

84878877882	Design and experiment on double cam-link of continuously variable transmission for seeding and fertilizing	In China, there are relatively few types of mechanical, continuously variable transmissions for variable rate seeding and fertilizing, while the electronic hydraulic application has the disadvantages of high cost, limited adjustable range, and poor accuracy and uniformity of distribution. To address these problems, and according to the analysis of the desired variable application rate of adjusting seed and fertilizer, the factors of the manufacturing costs, and the reliability of the structure for medium and small scale size farming operation, this paper put forward a method to achieve the variable speed of a transmission system based on a cam mechanism and connecting lever mechanism, designed the relevant parameters through the above principle mechanism, and developed the double cam link of continuously variable transmissions. The transmission achieved the variable rate of seeding and fertilizing through the simultaneous combined action of the output mechanism, transmission mechanism, and adjusting mechanism. In addition, in order to shorten the development processing cycle, reduce manufacturing cost, and increase the application efficiency, the three-dimensional modeling, simulation analysis, and optimization design were done based on Pro/E platform before the experiment prototype was put into manufacturing. The final analyzed kinematics simulation showed that the mechanisms of a continuously variable application rate transmission were reasonable, the quality of the cam contour curve was high, and the design scheme was feasible. Furthermore, for the purpose of testing the performance of the prototype which was manufactured accurately, a suit testing system that can simulate the actual operating environment of planter in the field was developed to calibrate the variable transmission's working accuracy and the uniformity of stability. Particularly, the system can perform satisfactorily with the double cam link of a continuously variable desired transmission both qualitatively and quantitatively. After multiple sets of performance calibrations of this experiment and data were analyzed, the results indicated that as transmission ratio changed, the relative error of measured output speed ranged from 0 to 10%, and the fluctuation range near the theoretical value of measured duty cycle was less than 10%, which met the requirement of transmission accuracy and stability. This study can provide some references for the development and design of continuously variable rate applications into small and medium scale agricultural farming machinery based on the above design and tests parameters, and at the same time, it can help to promote the development of exact seed and fertilizer use efficiency in agricultural mechanization operation, especially in China.

The collected soil was effectively chopped twice, so the soil could be well-covered. The variation coefficient of sowing depth and fertilizer depth were 4.33% and 2.73%, respectively. The passing ability of seeder satisfied the agronomic requirements.

84881383076	Spatial parameters of knotters of square balers	Spatial structure of the D-type knotter was studied based on its working sequence. Key spatial parameter relationships were confirmed to ensure the eight knotting processes going well through analyzing the knotter working principle, and the parameter model of knotter was build. Key spatial axes parameters were also designed by using mathematica 8.0 software, and two knotter frames were finally determined with different spatial parameters. The knotting experiments were carried out by using the two different knotter frames which were both assembled with the homogeneous New Holland parts, the results showed that, in the indoor experiment, the knotting rate of knotter frame I (KFI) was 1.0% lower than knotter frame II (KFII), while the average breaking force of the knot formed by the KFI was 13.9% higher than KFII at the same preload. In the field experiment, the knotting rate of KFI was decreased 4.0% in compared with KFII while its average breaking force was 2.5% higher than KFII. The average breaking force of the knot formed in the field was 94.2%-115.9% higher than indoor due to the different preloads and the additional extend force of the compressed straw baler.

84881391710	Effects of no-till opening seedbed on crop growth in annual double cropping areas in northern China	The effect of no-till (NT) opening seedbed characteristics on soil moisture, crop growth, yield and water use efficiency (WUE) was studied in the field experiment at Daxing in Beijing in 2008-2010. The results indicated that no-till opening seedbeds could increase the capacity of water storage. Compared with traditional tillage seedbed, volumetric soil water content increased by 0.2%-2.7% in 0-30 cm soil layer and the crops growth were also promoted. The best results were achieved by the seedbed of NT with the opening depth of 20 cm. Compared with traditional tillage seedbed, NT with the opening depth of 20 cm increased winter wheat yield and WUE by 2.4% and 7.4%, and summer maize yield and WUE by 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively. The study showed that 20 cm could be the suitable opening depth for no-till seeding in northern China plain.

84890907214	The effects of no-tillage with subsoiling on soil properties and maize yield: 12-Year experiment on alkaline soils of Northeast China	Soil sodicity and salinization are two major issues concerning agricultural production in Northern China and the affected areas are expanding at a rate of 1-1.5. Mha/year. The effects of two treatments, i.e. no-tillage with subsoiling and straw cover (NTSC) and conventional tillage with ploughing and straw removal (CTSR), on soil physical and chemical properties and yields were compared from 1999 to 2011. The results showed that NTSC reduced soil bulk density in the 0-30. cm soil layer, but more importantly the treatment increased total porosity by 20.9%, water stable aggregates and pore size class distribution. The enhance soil structure and improved infiltration in NTSC treatments contributed to reducing soil salinity by 20.3%-73.4% when compared with CTSR. Soil organic matter was significantly greater to 30. cm in NTSC, while total soil nitrogen was lower than CTSR treatments; however, available P was significantly higher in the 0-5. cm soil surface. During the first 3 years, there was no difference in spring maize yield between NTSC and CTSR, but yield significantly increased in NTSC compared with CTSR during the remaining years due to reduced salinity stress and increased soil health. In conclusion, NTSC soil management practices appear to be a more sustainable approach to farming than conventional methods that utilize intensive tillage and crop residue removal. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84891874871	Permanent raised beds improved soil physical properties in an annual double-cropping system	As a typical semi-humid area with a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) annual double-cropping system, Beijing has the lowest food production per capita and is suffering from severe soil degradation and low seedbed temperature in winter. This study evaluated the permanent raised bed (PRB) system in Beijing from 2005 to 2011 to investigate the effects of combining no tillage, residue cover, and controlled traffic with raised beds for improving soil properties. We found that the overall soil bulk density (0-30 cm) in PRB plots was significantly (P < 0.05) lower (by 12.4%) than that in traditional tillage (TT) plots, while the penetration resistance in the 10- to 20- and 20- to 30-cm soil layers of PRB plots was 18.2 and 26.1% lower (P < 0.05), respectively, than that of TT. The percentage of water-stable soil macroaggregates (>0.25 mm) in the PRB plots was 89.8% (P < 0.05) higher than in the TT plots, while the soil temperature was approximately 1.3 and 1.0°C higher under TT at the 5- and 15-cm depths, respectively, in winter. With these improvements, yields of PRBs appeared to have an increasing trend compared with no-till and TT treatments. © 2014 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

84892889434	Design and experiment of φ-type-knots knotters on Chinese small square balers	Since the knotters on the Chinese rectangular balers are imported from outside of the country, Chinese knotters with independent intellectual property rights is far away from being closed. In order to harvest a large quantity of straw in a short period on the small-scale lands of China, basic requirements on the knotters are summarized. Mathematical model of the knotter is also determined uniquely. Furthermore, the φ-type-knots knotter equipped on the Chinese square baler to form the φ type knots is designed. Knotting rate experiments of the φ-type-knots knotter on the test bench and in the wheat/maize straws covered fields are carried out to check the knotting performances of the knotter. The parameters of the formed knots are also tested. The experiments results show that the knotting rate of the φ-type-knots knotter reaches 100.0% on the test bench without straws, while reaches 99.6% in the wheat straws covered field and 100.0% in the maize straws covered field. The average maximum force in the knotting process is 194.7 N in the lab experiment. The length out of the knots formed in lab is 15.9%-20.6% lower than the knots formed in the field experiment. The breaking force of the knots formed in the field is 115.9%-167.2% higher than the knots formed in lab due to the higher preload and interactions with the compacted bales. Highly relevant relationships exist between the breaking force of the formed knots and the maximum force in the forming process of the knots in the lab experiment. The designed knotter breaks out the embarrassing situation of the domestic knotters which don't have independent intellectual property rights, and promotes the development of Chinese knotter technology, and the mathematical model is helpful for designing new type of knotters. © Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

84906896566	Simulation of soil cutting process by plane blade based on SPH method	This paper numerically simulated the soil cutting process of plane blade, one of the important components in no-till working implement, by ANSYS/LS_DYNA, with soil of conservation tillage in one year two crops area of North China. By theoretical analysis and test, the viability of SPH method on simulating the soil cutting process of plane blade was verified. By using MAT147 soil material model, SPH method and nodes-surface eroding contact, the finite element analysis on the soil cutting process of plane blade was implemented by ANSYS/LS_DYNA. Simulation result showed that SPH method could visually simulate the soil cutting process. The maximum Von Mises stress was 5.851 MPa and focused on the soil touching with plane blade. The Von Mises stress of soil had small fluctuation, so that the cutting was stable. The power consumption was approximately 10.2 kW at steady state, and the simulation error was not more than 0.05.It was proved that SPH method was viable, and finite element simulation could obtain parameters easily, such as scatter feature, force and power consumption, and reduce experimental cost and time. It provided a scientific basis for design optimization of conservation tillage anti-blocking implements.

84907361639	Development of small/medium size no-till and minimum-till seeders in Asia: A review	The benefits of conservation agriculture (CA), have been widely recognized and CA has been widely adopted in many parts of the world. However, there are some factors that limit the widespread adoption of CA in Asia. The most prominent factor appears to be the lack of suitable CA seeders for small to medium sized land-holding (SLH) farmers. This paper summarizes the small to medium no-till and minimum-till seeders currently available in Asia, and classifies these seeders into four types: manually operated units, animal traction seeders, two-wheel tractor and four-wheel tractor driven seeders. Detailed characteristics have been provided for some typical CA seeders and comparisons were made as to their suitability under particular working conditions. Typically manual and animal traction seeders are confined to small farms and hilly areas, while the larger CA seeders suited to four-wheel tractors are used on larger acreages. To ensure seeding performance on most four-wheel tractor CA seeders, two types of anti-blocking mechanisms (passive and active anti-blocking) have been fitted. Finally, the paper proposes a future direction and development of CA seeders for small/medium size farms in Asia, and also suggests changes in policy support, improvement of anti-blocking mechanisms, suitability for various crops, geographical zones and the contribution of development by public private partnerships to advance the adoption of CA seeders.

84920279793	Process of runoff and sediment yield in straw-covered sloping fields based on automatic runoff monitoring field	The design of an automatic water runoff monitoring field was outlined. It consisted of six runoff plots and a rainfall simulator, which was generally used to study erosive processes in sloping fields. A German-made surface runoff measuring device (Umwelt-Gerate-Technik GmbH, UGT) was used in this runoff field, which effectively improved sampling efficiency and reduced human error through automatic sampling and recording. The effect of straw cover on runoff processes and sediment yield on sloping fields was investigated using this runoff monitoring field. The results demonstrated that the straw cover could significantly decrease the rates of runoff and sediment deposition, and delay the onset of surface runoff and reduce the total amount of soil loss by 54.5%~63.8%. Maximum retention of plant residues as soil cover can effectively avoid sharp increases in runoff and limit water scouring effects. It is significant for alleviating soil erosion in sloping fields.

84921467275	Numerical simulation and experimental verification on water impinging jet quenching process of no-till planter disc opener	The disk opener is the key part of no-tillage planter and belongs to the ultrathin component. The ratio of its diameter and thickness is over 100. It is prone to end up with large deformations during the quenching process. Thus, how to reduce the deformation through optimizing the quenching parameters under the premise of achieving martensite and high hardness property is both a meaningful and challenging subject. In this paper, a new method of water jet impingement was proposed to quench the disc opener. The finite element analysis software DEFORM had been utilized to simulate the water jet impingement quenching process of the disc opener and optimize the quenching parameters. The velocity of the jet current, nozzle diameter and nozzle spacing had been selected as the process parameters of water jet impingement quenching. The control variable method was used to analyze the influence of the quenching parameter. Five levels of each jet array parameter were designed and the influences on the disc opener's hardness and flatness were simulated by DEFORM. The results show that: The nozzle spacing exerts significant influence on hardness and deformation. With the decrease of the nozzle spacing, nozzles above the disc opener become dense. At the same time, the direct heat transfer area expands and the cooling speed enlarges to achieve high hardness. The disc opener can be fully hardened and achieve the highest hardness as nozzle spacing is 4-5 mm. On the other hand, with the increase of the nozzle spacing the cooling uniformity increases first and then decreases. The deformation shows a parabola relationship with nozzle spacing and the maximum deformation reaches 1.80×10
