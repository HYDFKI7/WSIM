84940257561	Pansharpening Based on Intrinsic Image Decomposition	A fused image of high spatial and spectral resolutions can be obtained by fusing a panchromatic (PAN) image with a multi-spectral (MS) image. In this paper, a new image fusion method is proposed, based on an intrinsic image decomposition model which assumes that an image can be separated into two components: the reflectance and illumination components. In pansharpening, it is known that the PAN image is a good substitute for the illumination of the ideal high resolution MS image. Therefore, the reflectance of the low resolution MS image can be estimated with the MS image and the downsampled PAN image. Then, through combining the upsampled reflectance component with the high resolution illumination component (the original PAN image), the pansharpened high resolution MS image can be reconstructed. Experiments performed on three data sets captured by different satellite sensors demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain clear fused images without causing a serious spectral distortion. Furthermore, since the proposed method requires dot multiplication, division, downsampling, and upsampling operations to be performed only once, it can be implemented for a very fast performance.

9244257883	Fusing images with different focuses using support vector machines	Many vision-related processing tasks, such as edge detection, image segmentation and stereo matching, can be performed more easily when all objects in the scene are in good focus. However, in practice, this may not be always feasible as optical lenses, especially those with long focal lengths, only have a limited depth of field. One common approach to recover an everywhere-in-focus image is to use wavelet-based image fusion. First, several source images with different focuses of the same scene are taken and processed with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Among these wavelet decompositions, the wavelet coefficient with the largest magnitude is selected at each pixel location. Finally, the fused image can be recovered by performing the inverse DWT. In this paper, we improve this fusion procedure by applying the discrete wavelet frame transform (DWFT) and the support vector machines (SVM). Unlike DWT, DWFT yields a translation-invariant signal representation. Using features extracted from the DWFT coefficients, a SVM is trained to select the source image that has the best focus at each pixel location, and the corresponding DWFT coefficients are then incorporated into the composite wavelet representation. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional approach both visually and quantitatively. © 2004 IEEE.

14544284481	Combining wavelet and ridgelet transforms for texture classifications using support vector machines	In this paper, we propose a method using combining features from discrete wavelet transform and ridgelet transform for texture classification. Typically the 2D wavelet transform is good at capturing point singularities, while the ridgelet transform is good at capturing line singularities. Support vector machines (SVMs), which have demonstrated excellent performance in a variety of pattern recognition problems, were used as classifiers. The algorithm is tested on three different datasets, selected from Brodatz and VisTex database. Experimental results demonstrated the combination of the two feature sets always outperformed each method individually.

2942579442	A novel improved median filter for the removal of impulse noise from highly corrupted images	Median filter is well known for removing impulse noise but this filter distorts the fine structure of the signals as well. In this paper, a novel improved median filter is proposed to restore images corrupted by salt and pepper noise. The proposed filter is composed of two main parts. One part calculates the overall median of the windows centered on the considered pixel. The second part produces the filtered pixel value according to nonlinear transformation of the difference between the considered pixel and the overall median. We test our proposed algorithm and compare it with other well known filters, which are the simple median filter, the iterative median filter, the rank-ordered mean filter, and the progressive switching median filter. Simulation results demonstrate that the developed algorithm is capable of providing significant improvement over many published techniques in terms of both subjective and objective evaluations and is very effective for the cases where the images are very highly corrupted.

An actively Q-switched Nd: YAG laser is used as the pumping source, with pulse width of 11.7 ns and energy of 80 mJ. The Raman laser cavity is a flat-flat one. Four output couplers with different reflectivities for the first- and second-Stokes wavelengths are used in the experiment. The relations between the output energy and pumping energy are measured, and the relations between the conversion efficiency and pumping energy are calculated. When the output coupler reflectivity for the first-Stokes wavelength is 39.9%, the obtained maximum output energy and conversion efficiency of the first-Stokes pulses are 23.9 mJ and 36.2%, respectively. When the output coupler reflectivities for the first and the second-Stokes wavelengths are 80.5% and 12.4%, respectively, the obtained maximum output energy and conversion efficiency of the second-Stokes pulses are 16.4 mJ and 25.4%, respectively.

The normalized radiation transfer equations and rate equations were solved numerically to find the optimum reflectivity of the output coupler to realize the maximum conversion efficiency at the first Stokes for both the single and double-pass pumping configurations. Also, the pulse duration of the first Stokes was investigated numerically. The rate equations are verified to be a good approximation to the radiation transfer equations for the regime of low Raman gain and long pump pulse duration. Furthermore, it is found that the optimum reflectivity of the first Stokes and the second Stokes threshold are influenced significantly by the minor feedback of the resonator mirror at the second Stokes.

33750928259	Improved method of calculating thermal lens focal length in 'Top-hat' end-pumped solid-state lasers	The thermal effect is one of the factors that must be considered in designing the fiber coupled laser diode (LD) end-pumped solid-state lasers. The most convenient way of studying the thermal effect is using an ideal lens with equivalent thermal focal length. The old expression of the thermal lens (TL) focal length gives values smaller than the actual one. The cause leading to the difference is studied and a new more precise method is given. Numerical calculation is done and curve fitting equations are presented. The results show that the focal length is not only a function of the pump power but also a function of the ratio of the laser radius to the pump radius. When the laser radius is about the same as the pump radius, the ratio of the new value of the focal length to the old one is about 1.6. And at the same condition, the new value of the diffraction loss is much smaller than the one calculated by the old value of the focal length, and is also a function of the pump radius and the laser radius. Experiments show that the new values are closer to the measured results than the old ones.

A projection profile is computed at each angle, and the angle that maximizes a criterion function is regarded as the skew angle. Experimental results show that this algorithm performs well on document images of various layouts and is also robust to different languages.

The rate equations for Q-switched lasers have been treated before, by considering the pump beam as a Gaussian distribution. This paper deals with the rate equations and the solutions for Q-switched lasers under a top-hat pump beam distribution. The normalized rate equation is obtained and solved numerically. A group of general curves are given and the comparison with the results under the Gaussian pump beam distribution and the plane-wave approximation is made. The results show that the solutions of the rate equations under a top-hat pump beam distribution are different from those under a Gaussian pump beam distribution, but the difference is very small. The solutions of the rate equations under both situations can give much more precise theoretical results than those under the plane-wave approximation. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

84887414058	Higher quality of infrared images for future network security systems	It is well known that infrared (IR) imaging has been used extensively for various applications, in particularly in those dark conditions. Therefore, it has been widely employed in various tracking systems, in particularly, with the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors integrated with cloud computing, which makes IR even more popular for future networks. But various images, including IR images almost cannot avoid contaminations from various noises sources even when they were born. High quality images are particularly needed in those applications, especially for the security and military environments. In order to obtain a good quality of IR image for the future network security, in our current paper, it proposes a novel denoising algorithm based on Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau wavelets followed by the low-pass filters with the length 9 and 7 (CDF 9/7) wavelet transform. In our algorithm, we first applied the lifting structure to improve the drawbacks of a traditional wavelet transform. As the normal wavelet transform appears to be restricted and limited for a class of opportunities of multi-scale representation of multi-dimensional signals to estimate the noise level and then remove them from original images, which is less efficient and effective. In contrast, our proposed algorithm in this paper is much efficient in estimating and reducing noises from the images contaminated by multi noises, such as Gaussian noise, Poisson noise, and impulse (Salt& pepper) noise. Experimental results on several tests for infrared images by using our algorithm are presented, as an example, under the noise with standard deviation (σ = 0.2 and density = 20% cases, for peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) increasing 14%; mean square error (MSE) our method decreasing 83%; and mean of structural similarity (MSSIM) increasing 67% under the same conditions. Obviously, the results strongly support the fact that our proposed algorithm is significantly superior to other related methods. © 2013 NICT.

84887842762	Fast acquisition and reconstruction of optical coherence tomography images via sparse representation	In this paper, we present a novel technique, based on compressive sensing principles, for reconstruction and enhancement of multi-dimensional image data. Our method is a major improvement and generalization of the multi-scale sparsity based tomographic denoising (MSBTD) algorithm we recently introduced for reducing speckle noise. Our new technique exhibits several advantages over MSBTD, including its capability to simultaneously reduce noise and interpolate missing data. Unlike MSBTD, our new method does not require an a priori high-quality image from the target imaging subject and thus offers the potential to shorten clinical imaging sessions. This novel image restoration method, which we termed sparsity based simultaneous denoising and interpolation (SBSDI), utilizes sparse representation dictionaries constructed from previously collected datasets. We tested the SBSDI algorithm on retinal spectral domain optical coherence tomography images captured in the clinic. Experiments showed that the SBSDI algorithm qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. © 2013 IEEE.

84887921410	High quality infrared images with novel algorithm for multi-noises removal	Infrared (IR) images have been used extensively for military and civilian purposes, in particular in dark conditions. High quality images are particularly needed in various applications, especially for the security and military environments. But various images, including IR images, almost cannot avoid various noises when they were born as noise sources are distributed almost everywhere. In our paper, in order to obtain a good quality of IR image, it proposes a novel denoising algorithm based on Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau wavelets with the low-pass filters of the length 9 and 7 (CDF 9/7) wavelet transform. We also first applied the lifting structure to improve the drawbacks of a traditional wavelet transform. As the normal wavelet transform seems to be restricted and limited a class of opportunities for multi-scale representation of multi-dimensional signals to estimate noises and then remove the noises from original images. The final simulation results show that our proposed algorithm in this paper is much efficient in estimating and reducing noises from the images contaminated by multi noises, such as Gaussian noise, Poisson noise, and impulse (Salt& pepper) noise. Experimental results on several tests for infrared images by using this algorithm are presented, for example under the noise with σ = 0.2 and density = 20% cases, for mean square error (MSE) our method decreasing 83%; peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) increasing 14% and mean of structural similarity (MSSIM) increasing 67% with the same conditions. Obviously, the results show our proposed algorithm significantly superior to other related methods.

43249115812	Multifocus image fusion by combining curvelet and wavelet transform	When an image is captured by CCD device, only the objects at focus plane would appear sharp. A practicable way to get an image with all objects in focus is to fuse images acquired with different focus levels of the scene. In this paper, we propose a multifocus image fusion algorithm based on combination of wavelet and curvelet transform. Although the fused results obtained by wavelet or curvelet transform individually are encouraging, there is still large room for further improvement because wavelets do not represent long edges well while curvelets are challenged with small features. So in the proposed method, these two methods are combined together. Each of the registered images is decomposed using curvelet transform firstly. Then the coefficients are fused using wavelet-based image fusion method. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by performing the inverse curvelet transform. The experimental results on several images show that the combined fusion algorithm exhibits clear advantages over any individual transform alone. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

42249086780	Multifocus image fusion using region segmentation and spatial frequency	Image fusion is a process of combining complementary information from multiple images of the same scene into an image, so that the resultant image contains a more accurate description of the scene than any of the individual source images. In this paper, a new region-based multifocus image fusion method is proposed. The motivation of our proposed method lies in the fact that region-based image fusion methods could be more meaningful than pixel-based fusion methods which just consider individual pixels or associated local neighborhoods of pixels in the fusion process. The fusion process contains the following steps: firstly, multifocus images are fused using the simple average method. Then the intermediate fused image is segmented using the normalized cut method. Then the two source images are segmented according to the segmenting result of the intermediate fused image. Finally, the corresponding segmented regions of the source images are fused according to their spatial frequencies. Experimental results on several pairs of multi-focus image show that the proposed method can give good results. The proposed method is more robust to misregistration or slight motion of the object than the pixel-based method. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

43849083893	Heuristic breadth-first search algorithm for informative gene selection based on gene expression profiles	The tumor diagnosis method based on gene expression profiles will be developed into the fast and effective method in clinical domain in the near future. Although DNA microarray experiments provide us with huge amount of gene expression data, only a few of genes are related to tumor in gene expression profiles. Moreover, it is difficult to select informative genes related to tumor from gene expression profiles because of its characteristics such as high dimensionality, small sample set and many noises in gene expression profiles. According to its characteristic, a novel heuristic breadth-first search algorithm based on support vector machines is proposed, which can simultaneously find as many informative gene subsets as possible in which the number of informative genes is almost least but its classification performance is almost highest in spite of its time-consuming characteristic. Three tumor sample sets are examined by the novel approach and experiments show that the novel approach is feasible and effective in tumor classification. Experiment results show that 100% of 4-fold cross-validation accuracy has been achieved by only two, four and four genes for leukemia, colon tumor and SRBCT (Small Round Blue Cells Tumor) datasets, respectively, which is superior to the results of other tumor classification methods. To avoid the affect of different partition of sample set, the full-fold cross-validated method that can more objectively evaluate the classification performance of informative gene subset is proposed.

48349146156	Gene selection using neighborhood rough set from gene expression profiles	Although adopting feature reduction in classic rough set theory to select informative genes is an effective method, its classification accuracy rate is usually not higher compared with other tumor-related gene selection and tumor classification approaches; for gene expression values must be discretized before gene reduction, which leads to information loss in tumor classification. Therefore, the neighborhood rough set model proposed by Hu Qing-Hua is introduced to tumor classification, which omits the discretization procedure, so no information loss occurs before gene reduction. Experiments on two well-known tumor dataseis show that gene selection using neighborhood rough set model obviously outperforms using classic rough set theory and experiment results also prove that the most of the selected gene subset not only has higher accuracy rate but also are related to tumor. © 2007 IEEE.

56349089205	ADASYN: Adaptive synthetic sampling approach for imbalanced learning	This paper presents a novel adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) sampling approach for learning from imbalanced data sets. The essential idea of ADASYN is to use a weighted distribution for different minority class examples according to their level of difficulty in learning, where more synthetic data is generated for minority class examples that are harder to learn compared to those minority examples that are easier to learn. As a result, the ADASYN approach improves learning with respect to the data distributions in two ways: (1) reducing the bias introduced by the class imbalance, and (2) adaptively shifting the classification decision boundary toward the difficult examples. Simulation analyses on several machine learning data sets show the effectiveness of this method across five evaluation metrics. ©2008 IEEE.

57949083048	Region-based color fusion method for visible and IR image sequences	A novel region-based color mapping method is proposed to render fused image of visible and infrared (IR). The method is based on image segmentation, region recognition, image fusion and color transfer. Firstly visible image and IR image are fused based on the curvelet transform. At the same time, a color database is formed by grouping a set of natural color images according to their scene contents. A false color image obtained by assigning the source images to RGB channels is segmented with the multiscale normalized cuts method. Then each segmented region is recognized by support vector machine (SVM) and automatically associated with a natural color image. Finally the colors of the natural color image are transferred to the segmented region in a perceptually decorrelated color space. Experiments show that the image colorized by the proposed method resembles the natural color appearance and will help the observer interpreting the scene more intuitively than produced by other coloring methods. ©2008 IEEE.

But in some practical applications (such as image and video processing systems), an increased sampling frequency will substantially increase the data storage and transmission costs. Different from the traditional signal acquisition process, compressive sensing, which is a new theory that captures and represents compressible signals at a sampling rate significantly below the Nyquist rate. It first employs nonadaptive linear projections that preserve the structure of the signal, and then the signal reconstruction is conducted using an optimization process from these projections. Compressive sensing has broad applications such as compressive imaging, analog-to-information conversion, biosensing, etc. This paper surveys the principles of compressive sensing and its related applications.

In the method, first, the source image is represented with sparse coefficients using an overcomplete dictionary. Second, the coefficients are combined with the choose-max fusion rule. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed from the combined sparse coefficients and the dictionary. Furthermore, the proposed fusion scheme can simultaneously resolve the image restoration and fusion problem by changing the approximate criterion in the sparse representation algorithm.

77952542640	Tuning SVM parameters by using a hybrid CLPSO-BFGS algorithm	Parameter settings of support vector machine (SVM) have a great influence on its performance. Grid search combining with cross-validation and numerical methods by minimizing some generalization error bounds are two usually adopted methods to tune the multiple parameters in SVM. However, the grid search is often time-consuming, especially when dealing with multiple parameters while the numerical methods are very sensitive to the initial value of the parameters. In this paper, we present a hybrid strategy to combine a comprehensive learning particle swarm optimizer (CLPSO) with Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method for effectively tuning the SVM parameters based on the generalization bounds. Rather than locating a single local optimum, the hybrid method can identify multiple local optima of the generalization bounds, which can greatly improve the stability of the parameter settings. The experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently tune the parameters of both L1-SVM and L2-SVM and achieve competitive performance compared with other optimized classifiers. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77952657394	Gene selection and parameter determination of support vector machines based on BPSO algorithm	The advent of microarray technology allows researchers to perform cancer diagnosis on gene level. However, the microarray data usually contains a large quantity of irrelevant, noisy and redundant genes which may seriously deteriorate the prediction accuracy. What's more, microarray data always suffers from the problem of a relatively small number of samples, which raises the difficulties in diagnosis. Accordingly, gene selection plays an important role in cancer diagnosis using microarray data. As a state-of-the-art classifier, support vector machine (SVM) has been successfully applied in solving the small-sample recognition problems and therefore is very suitable for microarray data processing. However, to improve the recognition accuracy, it is essential to choose certain good enough parameters for SVM in applications. This study proposes a new gene selection method based on a binary version of particle swarm optimisation (BPSO) algorithm and SVM. In the method, the task of gene selection and parameter tuning of SVM is performed simultaneously by BPSO. To verify the proposed method, three benchmark dataset (leukaemia, breast and colon) are studied. The experimental results show that the proposed method is highly effective and competitive compared with other methods. Copyright © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

78651415142	An efficient dictionary learning algorithm for sparse representation	Sparse and redundant representation of data assumes an ability to describe signals as linear combinations of a few atoms from a dictionary. If the model of the signal is unknown, the dictionary can be learned from a set of training signals. Like the K-SVD, many of the practical dictionary learning algorithms are composed of two main parts: sparse-coding and dictionary-update. This paper first proposes a Stagewise least angle regression (St-LARS) method for performing the sparse-coding operation. The St-LARS applies a hard-thresholding strategy into the original least angle regression (LARS) algorithm, which enables it to select many atoms at each iteration and thus results in fast solutions while still provides good results. Then, a dictionary update method named approximated singular value decomposition (ASVD) is used on the dictionary update stage. It is a quick approximation of the exact SVD computation and can reduce the complexity of it. Experiments on both synthetic data and 3-D image denoising demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm over other dictionary learning methods not only in terms of better trained dictionary but also in terms of computation time. ©2010 IEEE.

Firstly, the IHS transform is applied to multi-spectral image. Then, the panchromatic image and the intensity component of multi-spectral image are fused through sparse representation. Sparse representation is used in local image patch instead of the whole image, because the size of image is usually large which is not suitable to sparse representation.

First, a quad-tree structure is efficiently embedded into a sparse dictionary model. This enables the dictionary to discover the complex structures in the given data and to be easily employed to high dimensional data. Besides, we propose a joint 3-D operation to exploit the correlations among the similar blocks, as the non-local denoising model assumes that there exist mutually similar blocks in nature images. This 3-D operation is achieved by a simple concatenation of the similar patches to a single vector and training the proposed dictionary on it.

First, the degradation model from a high- to low-resolution multispectral (MS) image and high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image is constructed as a linear sampling process which is formulated as a matrix. Then, the model matrix is considered as the measurement matrix in CS, so pan-sharpening is converted into signal restoration problem with sparsity regularization. Finally, the basis pursuit (BP) algorithm is used to resolve the restoration problem, which can recover the high-resolution MS image effectively. The QuickBird and IKONOS satellite images are used to test the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can well preserve spectral and spatial details of the source images. The pan-sharpened high-resolution MS image by the proposed method is competitive or even superior to those images fused by other well-known methods. © 2006 IEEE.

79953884678	Image inpainting with salient structure completion and texture propagation	Image inpainting technique uses structural and textural information to repair or fill missing regions of a picture. Inspired by human visual characteristics, we introduce a new image inpainting approach which includes salient structure completion and texture propagation. In the salient structure completion step, incomplete salient structures are detected using wavelet transform, and completion order is determined through color texture and curvature features around the incomplete salient structures. Afterwards, curve fitting and extension are used to complete the incomplete salient structures. In the texture propagation step, the proposed approach first synthesizes texture information of completed salient structures. Then, the texture information is propagated into the remaining missing regions. A number of examples on real and synthetic images demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in removing occluding objects. Our results compare favorably to those obtained by existing greedy inpainting techniques. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

79956151939	Multi-focus image fusion using watershed transform and morphological wavelet clarity measure	Optical imaging cameras suffer from the problem of finite depth of field, which cannot make objects at various distances (from the sensor) all in focus. Practically, the image fusion technique is usually used to solve this problem. In this paper, we proposed a region-based image fusion method which is similar as the manual cut-and-paste method the fused image from which is often seen as the 'ideal' everywhere-focus image. In order to reduce the computational complexity, the watershed transform is employed to achieve image segmentation, and the morphological wavelet transform coefficients are used as the clarity measurements. The proposed method is compared with a pixel-based wavelet transform method and a region-based Laplacian pyramid method.

0035766679	Landsat TM and SAR images fusion by multiwavelet transform	Multiwavelet transform, a new notion addition to wavelet theory, offers simultaneous orthogonality, symmetry, short support, and vanishing moments, which are not possible with scalar wavelets. In this paper, a novel fusion method for Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Synergetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using multiwavelet transform is proposed. The approximation subband of the fused multiwavelet transform representation is from that of Landsat TM image, and the detail subbands are constructed by fusing those of Landsat TM and SAR images. The proposed method was compared quantitatively with intensity-hue-saturation, principal component analysis, and wavelet transform. It was found that the presented technique is clearly better than those methods in preserving both spectral and spatial information.

79960699547	A hybrid PSO-BFGS strategy for global optimization of multimodal functions	Particle swarm optimizer (PSO) is a powerful optimization algorithm that has been applied to a variety of problems. It can, however, suffer from premature convergence and slow convergence rate. Motivated by these two problems, a hybrid global optimization strategy combining PSOs with a modified Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method is presented in this paper. The modified BFGS method is integrated into the context of the PSOs to improve the particles' local search ability. In addition, in conjunction with the territory technique, a reposition technique to maintain the diversity of particles is proposed to improve the global search ability of PSOs. One advantage of the hybrid strategy is that it can effectively find multiple local solutions or global solutions to the multimodal functions in a box-constrained space. Based on these local solutions, a reconstruction technique can be adopted to further estimate better solutions. The proposed method is compared with several recently developed optimization algorithms on a set of 20 standard benchmark problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can obtain high-quality solutions on multimodal function optimization problems. © 2011 IEEE.

The proposed method fully considers the complementary between the fast inpainting method and sparse representation inpainting approach. In this manner, our approach inpaints the small size textural missing image more effectively than the available inpainting method. The experimental results on practical images show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a plausible visual performance without the discontinuity boundary and blurring.

80053046342	A semi-automatic method for vascular image segmentation	Vascular diseases are major public heath problem around the world. Vessel segmentation has been widely concerned because it is a key step for diagnosis and surgical planning. Among past strategies, multi-scale line filters are very popular detectors. However, multiscale integration results in undesirable diffusion when two vessels are closely located. To avoid this problem, we use gradient vector flow as vector field and introduce a vesselness measure to detect vessel which gives high and homogeneous output for line structure so that it is more suitable for segmentation over Frangi's vesselness measure. Level set method is applied to perform vessel segmentation. Our model is tested on real images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can successfully separate closely adjacent vessels and address the problems of low contrast and varying vessel width. It shows better performance than multi-scale approach. Furthermore, gradient vector flow makes the contour moving into boundary concavities. © 2011 IEEE.

80053987231	Pixel-level image fusion with simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit	Pixel-level image fusion integrates the information from multiple images of one scene to get an informative image which is more suitable for human visual perception or further image-processing. Sparse representation is a new signal representation theory which explores the sparseness of natural signals. Comparing to the traditional multiscale transform coefficients, the sparse representation coefficients can more accurately represent the image information. Thus, this paper proposes a novel image fusion scheme using the signal sparse representation theory. Because image fusion depends on local information of source images, we conduct the sparse representation on overlapping patches instead of the whole image, where a small size of dictionary is needed. In addition, the simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit technique is introduced to guarantee that different source images are sparsely decomposed into the same subset of dictionary bases, which is the key to image fusion. The proposed method is tested on several categories of images and compared with some popular image fusion methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method can provide superior fused image in terms of several quantitative fusion evaluation indexes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

83655167351	Signal denoising with random refined orthogonal matching pursuit	In this paper, an efficient sparse recovery algorithm called random refined orthogonal matching pursuit (RROMP) is proposed for signal denoising. Given a noisy signal, the RROMP algorithm first generates several sparse representations of it by applying a multi-selection strategy and a false discovery rate (FDR) control, instead of seeking the sparsest one. The multi-selection strategy accelerates the whole process of generating the representations, while the FDR control enables each representation to be competitive. Then the generated representations are averaged to form a more accurate estimate in the sense of mean-square-error (MSE). Our experiments on both synthetically generated signals and natural images demonstrate the superiority of the RROMP algorithm. © 2011 IEEE.

Through combining the characteristic of preserving edge of the bilateral filter with the ability of capturing directional information of the directional filter bank, the MDBF can better represent the intrinsic geometrical structure of images. The MDBF, which is a multiscale, multidirectional and shift-invariant image decomposition scheme, is used to fuse multisensor images in this paper. The source images are first decomposed into the directional detail subbands and the approximation subbands via the MDBF. Then, the directional detail subbands and the approximation subbands are fused according to the given fusion rule, respectively. Finally, the inverse MDBF is applied to the fused subbands to obtain the fused image.

84862804007	Multitemporal image change detection using a detail-enhancing approach with nonsubsampled contourlet transform	In this letter, we propose an unsupervised approach for change detection in multitemporal satellite images based on a novel detail-enhancing algorithm. The multitemporal source images are first used to generate the difference image, which is decomposed into low-pass approximation and high-pass directional subbands by the nonsubsampled contourlet transform. The coefficients from the directional subbands are fused at intrascale and interscale to extract the meaningful details of the difference image. After that, the extracted details are injected into one base image selected from the approximation subbands, which results in a detail-enhanced difference image. For each pixel in the enhanced difference image, a dimension-reduced feature vector is created using the principal component analysis (PCA). The final change detection map is achieved by clustering the feature vectors using a PCA-guided k-means algorithm into changed and unchanged classes. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with several well-known change detection techniques. © 2012 IEEE.

84863027679	Multitemporal image change detection with compressed sparse representation	In this paper, we propose a novel feature vector clustering method for unsupervised change detection in multitemporal satellite images. A feature vector for each pixel is extracted using the compressed sparse representation of the difference image which is obtained by comparing a pair of co-registered images acquired at different times on the same area. The compressed sparse representation is achieved by taking two stages: compressed sampling and sparse representation. The compressed sampling is first employed in order to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors. Then, the sparse representation is applied to extract the meaningful change information and to combat the noise interference. The final change detection is obtained by clustering the extracted feature vectors using k-means algorithm into "changed" and "unchanged" classes. Experimental results clearly show that the proposed approach consistently yields superior performance compared to several well-known change detection techniques on both noise-free and noisy satellite images. © 2011 IEEE.

84862960680	An efficient dictionary learning algorithm and its application to 3-d medical image denoising	In this paper, we propose an efficient dictionary learning algorithm for sparse representation of given data and suggest a way to apply this algorithm to 3-D medical image denoising. Our learning approach is composed of two main parts: sparse coding and dictionary updating. On the sparse coding stage, an efficient algorithm named multiple clusters pursuit (MCP) is proposed. The MCP first applies a dictionary structuring strategy to cluster the atoms with high coherence together, and then employs a multiple-selection strategy to select several competitive atoms at each iteration. These two strategies can greatly reduce the computation complexity of the MCP and assist it to obtain better sparse solution. On the dictionary updating stage, the alternating optimization that efficiently approximates the singular value decomposition is introduced. Furthermore, in the 3-D medical image denoising application, a joint 3-D operation is proposed for taking the learning capabilities of the presented algorithm to simultaneously capture the correlations within each slice and correlations across the nearby slices, thereby obtaining better denoising results. The experiments on both synthetically generated data and real 3-D medical images demonstrate that the proposed approach has superior performance compared to some well-known methods. © 2006 IEEE.

84863130786	Fast decomposed gradient projection algorithm for sparse representation	Finding the sparse representation of a signal on an over-complete dictionary plays a very important role in many problems, such as pattern recognition and compressive sensing. In this paper we propose a novel technique called fast decomposed gradient projection algorithm (FDGP) to solve the sparse representation problem by minimizing a bound-constrained quadratic problem (BCQP) containing a quadratic error term and a regularization term. Different from the original gradient projection method, FDGP iterates from an all-zero vector and only updates the positions that are most likely nonzero in each iteration. In view of that the sparse solution usually contains a very small number of nonzero elements, the proposed method can efficiently improve convergence rate of the gradient projection method for sparse representation especially on large scale problems. As we will show, the complexity of the proposed method can be little influenced by the size of the dictionary and only depends on the sparsity of a given signal. Experimental results show the proposed methods can achieve effective and efficient decomposition performance under the over-complete dictionary.

84870520820	Group-sparse representation with dictionary learning for medical image denoising and fusion	Recently, sparse representation has attracted a lot of interest in various areas. However, the standard sparse representation does not consider the intrinsic structure, i.e., the nonzero elements occur in clusters, called group sparsity. Furthermore, there is no dictionary learning method for group sparse representation considering the geometrical structure of space spanned by atoms. In this paper, we propose a novel dictionary learning method, called Dictionary Learning with Group Sparsity and Graph Regularization (DL-GSGR). First, the geometrical structure of atoms is modeled as the graph regularization. Then, combining group sparsity and graph regularization, the DL-GSGR is presented, which is solved by alternating the group sparse coding and dictionary updating. In this way, the group coherence of learned dictionary can be enforced small enough such that any signal can be group sparse coded effectively. Finally, group sparse representation with DL-GSGR is applied to 3-D medical image denoising and image fusion. Specifically, in 3-D medical image denoising, a 3-D processing mechanism (using the similarity among nearby slices) and temporal regularization (to perverse the correlations across nearby slices) are exploited. The experimental results on 3-D image denoising and image fusion demonstrate the superiority of our proposed denoising and fusion approaches. © 2012 IEEE.

First, a fast SR classifier (FSR-C) with Matching Pursuit (MP) solution is proposed. In the FSR-C, the dictionary is composed of training images. Just one nonzero element in SR coefficient of the testing image is found out based on MP, and the testing image is classified through the location of the nonzero element. To further improve the recognition accuracy, the SVM classifier (SVM-C) is selected. In SVM-C, PCA feature is extracted, and for seeking the linear separating hyperplane, the RBF kernel function is used in mapping the training vectors into high dimensional space. The results of the FSR-C and the SVM-C are fused obeying Bayesian rule to make the decision. The Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) SAR image database is used to test the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the FSR-C can predict testing SAR images with considerable recognition accuracy and high real-time ability, and the decision fusion recognition method can improve the recognition accuracy and still be fast. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84878308650	Image matting for fusion of multi-focus images in dynamic scenes	In this paper, we address the problem of fusing multi-focus images in dynamic scenes. The proposed approach consists of three main steps: first, the focus information of each source image obtained by morphological filtering is used to get the rough segmentation result which is one of the inputs of image matting. Then, image matting technique is applied to obtain the accurate focused region of each source image. Finally, the focused regions are combined together to construct the fused image. Through image matting, the proposed fusion algorithm combines the focus information and the correlations between nearby pixels together, and therefore tends to obtain more accurate fusion result. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over traditional multi-focus image fusion methods, especially for those images in dynamic scenes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84883814326	Remote sensing image fusion via sparse representations over learned dictionaries	Remote sensing image fusion can integrate the spatial detail of panchromatic (PAN) image and the spectral information of a low-resolution multispectral (MS) image to produce a fused MS image with high spatial resolution. In this paper, a remote sensing image fusion method is proposed with sparse representations over learned dictionaries. The dictionaries for PAN image and low-resolution MS image are learned from the source images adaptively. Furthermore, a novel strategy is designed to construct the dictionary for unknown high-resolution MS images without training set, which can make our proposed method more practical. The sparse coefficients of the PAN image and low-resolution MS image are sought by the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm. Then, the fused high-resolution MS image is calculated by combining the obtained sparse coefficients and the dictionary for the high-resolution MS image. By comparing with six well-known methods in terms of several universal quality evaluation indexes with or without references, the simulated and real experimental results on QuickBird and IKONOS images demonstrate the superiority of our method. © 1980-2012 IEEE.

84884204803	Face recognition using Weber local descriptors	This paper presents a method for face recognition using multi-scale Weber local descriptors (WLDs) and multi-level information fusion. Our method introduces the WLD, a novel and robust local descriptor, to describe the facial images and modifies it by a non-linear quantization approach to enhance its discriminative power. Moreover, a multi-scale framework for WLD extraction with multi-level information fusion approaches is provided for face representation and recognition. The proposed method has four main steps: (1) image partition: under given rules, each facial image is uniformly divided into a set of non-overlapped sub-regions; in this way, for a set of facial images, we therefore have a large pool of this type of sub-regions; (2) feature extraction: in this pool of sub-regions, taking one sub-region as a center, a group of similar ones are chosen for extraction of WLD histogram features; (3) features measurement: these WLD histograms are then fused into a single vector - as the feature of the center sub-region. Nearest neighborhood on chi-square is employed for similarity measurement between two sub-regions; and (4) voting: the recognition result of the entire probe (a face in sub-regions) is obtained via a voting function on the recognition result of all its sub-regions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method upon three popular datasets. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84885423284	Simultaneous image fusion and super-resolution using sparse representation	Given multiple source images of the same scene, image fusion integrates the inherent complementary information into one single image, and thus provides a more complete and accurate description. However, when the source images are of low-resolution, the resultant fused image can still be of low-quality, hindering further image analysis. To improve the resolution, a separate image super-resolution step can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for simultaneous image fusion and super-resolution. It is based on the use of sparse representations, and consists of three steps. First, the low-resolution source images are interpolated and decomposed into high- And low-frequency components. Sparse coefficients from these components are then computed and fused by using image fusion rules. Finally, the fused sparse coefficients are used to reconstruct a high-resolution fused image. Experiments on various types of source images (including magnetic resonance images, X-ray computed tomography images, visible images, infrared images, and remote sensing images) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method both quantitatively and qualitatively. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we apply SVMs for texture classification, using translation-invariant features generated from the discrete wavelet frame transform. To alleviate the problem of selecting the right kernel parameter in the SVM, we use a fusion scheme based on multiple SVMs, each with a different setting of the kernel parameter. Compared to the traditional Bayes classifier and the learning vector quantization algorithm, SVMs, and, in particular, the fused output from multiple SVMs, produce more accurate classification results on the Brodatz texture album. © 2003 Pattern Recognition Society.

84896389880	Feature extraction of hyperspectral images with image fusion and recursive filtering	Feature extraction is known to be an effective way in both reducing computational complexity and increasing accuracy of hyperspectral image classification. In this paper, a simple yet quite powerful feature extraction method based on image fusion and recursive filtering (IFRF) is proposed. First, the hyperspectral image is partitioned into multiple subsets of adjacent hyperspectral bands. Then, the bands in each subset are fused together by averaging, which is one of the simplest image fusion methods. Finally, the fused bands are processed with transform domain recursive filtering to get the resulting features for classification. Experiments are performed on different hyperspectral images, with the support vector machines (SVMs) serving as the classifier. By using the proposed method, the accuracy of the SVM classifier can be improved significantly. Furthermore, compared with other hyperspectral classification methods, the proposed IFRF method shows outstanding performance in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency. © 2013 IEEE.

84896403501	Pansharpening with Matting Model	Pansharpening aims at creating a fused image of high spatial and spectral resolutions through merging a panchromatic (PAN) image with a multispectral (MS) image. Component substitution is the most widely used pansharpening method. However, most research in this field focuses on improving the existing component substitution-based pansharpening methods, e.g., principal component substitution and intensity hue saturation transform. The major contribution of this paper is a novel component substitution framework based on an image matting model. The matting model refers to an MS image that can be decomposed into three components, i.e., alpha channel, spectral foreground, and background. Through substituting the alpha channel of the MS image with the PAN image, the high-resolution MS image is able to be reconstructed perfectly. Experiments performed on different data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art pansharpening methods in terms of subjective and objective evaluation. © 2013 IEEE.

In this paper, a novel spectral-spatial classification framework based on edge-preserving filtering is proposed. The proposed framework consists of the following three steps. First, the hyperspectral image is classified using a pixelwise classifier, e.g., the support vector machine classifier. Then, the resulting classification map is represented as multiple probability maps, and edge-preserving filtering is conducted on each probability map, with the first principal component or the first three principal components of the hyperspectral image serving as the gray or color guidance image. Finally, according to the filtered probability maps, the class of each pixel is selected based on the maximum probability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed edge-preserving filtering based classification method can improve the classification accuracy significantly in a very short time. Thus, it can be easily applied in real applications. © 1980-2012 IEEE.

84898968183	Face recognition with kernel sparse representation on Gabor features	In this paper, we propose a novel face recognition framework in which the image Gabor features are used for kernel sparse representation based classification (KSRC), i.e., Gabor features based KSRC (GKSRC). At first, each face image is convolved with a series of Gabor filters to extract Gabor features. To avoid careful selection of parameters for kernels, we propose to learn an optimal kernel through multiple kernel learning method (MKL) from a group of base kernels which are constructed from Gabor features. Then with the learned kernel, the kernel discriminant analysis (KDA) is used for dimension reduction. Finally, the query face image is recognized by minimizing the reconstruction error between the original image and its approximation in the kernel space. Experiments on AR, ORL and FERET databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GKSRC algorithm comparing with other face recognition schemes. © 2013 IEEE.

84904286286	Scanned image descreening with image redundancy and adaptive filtering	Currently, most electrophotographic printers use halftoning technique to print continuous tone images, so scanned images obtained from such hard copies are usually corrupted by screen like artifacts. In this paper, a new model of scanned halftone image is proposed to consider both printing distortions and halftone patterns. Based on this model, an adaptive filtering based descreening method is proposed to recover high quality contone images from the scanned images. Image redundancy based denoising algorithm is first adopted to reduce printing noise and attenuate distortions. Then, screen frequency of the scanned image and local gradient features are used for adaptive filtering. Basic contone estimate is obtained by filtering the denoised scanned image with an anisotropic Gaussian kernel, whose parameters are automatically adjusted with the screen frequency and local gradient information. Finally, an edge-preserving filter is used to further enhance the sharpness of edges to recover a high quality contone image. Experiments on real scanned images demonstrate that the proposed method can recover high quality contone images from the scanned images. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method produces very sharp edges and much cleaner smooth regions. © 2014 IEEE.

84906788649	Visual attention guided image fusion with sparse representation	Image fusion techniques aim at transferring useful information from the input source images to the fused image. The common assumption for most fusion approaches is that the useful information is defined by local features such as contrast, variance, and gradient. However, there is no consideration of global visual attention of the whole source images which indicates the "interesting" information of the source images. In this paper, we firstly review the patch-based image fusion methods which attract the attention and interest of many researchers. Then, a visual attention guided patch-based image fusion method is proposed. The visual attention maps of the source images are calculated from the sparse represent coefficients of the source images. Then, the sparse coefficients are fused with the guidance of visual attention maps in order to emphasize the global "interesting" objects in the source images. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed from the fused sparse coefficients. The new fusion strategy ensures that the objects being "interesting" for our visual system are preserved in the fused image. The proposed approach is tested on infrared and visual, medical, and multi-focus images. The results compared with those of traditional methods show obvious improvement in objective and subjective quality measurements. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

84908028989	Intrinsic image decomposition for feature extraction of hyperspectral images	In this paper, a novel feature extraction method based on intrinsic image decomposition (IID) is proposed for hyperspectral image classification. The proposed method consists of the following steps. First, the spectral dimension of the hyperspectral image is reduced with averaging-based image fusion. Then, the dimension reduced image is partitioned into several subsets of adjacent bands. Next, the reflectance and shading components of each subset are estimated with an optimization-based IID technique. Finally, pixel-wise classification is performed only on the reflectance components, which reflect the material-dependent properties of different objects. Experimental results show that, with the proposed feature extraction method, the support vector machine classifier is able to obtain much higher classification accuracy even when the number of training samples is quite small. This demonstrates that IID is indeed an effective way for feature extraction of hyperspectral images.

The proposed method focuses on one major problem in the process of mosaic: how to generate visually pleasant stitching result in the cases of misalignment, global and local intensity differences between images. First, two partially overlapped images are decomposed into high-frequency components and low-frequency components with Gaussian low-pass filter. Second, by considering the information characteristics contained in both separated components, different mosaic schemes are designed to accomplish stitching process accordingly. For the low-frequency components consisting of coarse shape and illumination information, two-dimension weighted blending rule is utilized to achieve smoothing transition. For the high-frequency components including rich details, an improved seam searching strategy based on dynamic programming is introduced. With the obtained stitching seam guiding the stitching process, visible structural break can be avoided. Finally, the mosaic result is produced by linearly composing both stitching results of different components together. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating seamless mosaic results without introducing any unexpected blurring or artifacts.
