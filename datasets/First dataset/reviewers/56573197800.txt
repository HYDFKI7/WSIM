1542791508	Polymorphism K469E of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 gene and restenosis after coronary stenting in Chinese patients	Background. Inflammation is a major cause of restenosis after coronary stenting. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is an important adhesion molecule that plays a key role in the tight adhesion between leukocytes and vascular endothelium. The object of this study was to investigate the association between the K469E polymorphism of the ICAM-1 gene and restenosis after coronary stenting in North Chinese population. Methods. The ICAM-1 K469E polymorphism was genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 124 patients who had undergone coronary stenting and coronary angiography at least 3 months earlier. Information on clinical risk factors and procedure-related data were also collected. Results. Of 124 enrolled patients in total, there were 72 cases of in-stent restenosis. The restenosis rate in this population was 58.1%. The frequencies of the three possible genotypes of the ICAM-1 K469E polymorphism were: KK genotype 50.8%, EE genotype 41.9%, and EK genotype 41.9%. Among restenosis patients, the frequency of the KK genotype was 58.3% and the frequency of E allele carriers was 41.7%. Among non-restenosis patients, the frequency of the KK genotype was 40.4%, and the frequency of E allele carriers was 59.6%. The distribution of these two genotype groups between restenosis and non-restenosis patients was significantly different (P = 0.049). Using multivariate logistic regression, the difference between the two groups was more apparent. The odds ratio of KK homozygotes vs E allele carriers was 2.6, with 95% confidence interval 1.2-5.8 (P = 0.018). After grading of risk factors, we found that the KK genotype was a stronger predictor of instent restenosis in obesity or hyperlipemia patients, with an odds ratio of 9.3 and 3.7, respectively (P <0.05). Conclusion. In our study population, KK homozygotes of the ICAM-1 codon 469 mutation had a higher risk of restenosis after coronary stenting, especially in the case of obese or hyperlipemia patients.

27644582899	Polymorphism of cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene I405V and lipid regulating effect of simvastatin	Aim: To investigate the influences of polymorphism of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene 1405V on the level of blood fat and the lipid lowing effect of simvastatin. Methods: 1 A total of 369 patients with abnormal blood fat, who hospitalized at the Department of Cardiology, First Hospital, Peking University, were selected, and they all signed the knowledge agreement. 2 The polymorphism of CETP-I405V was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Simvastatin 20 mg was performed in the 211 coronary heart disease patients accompanied with hypercholesterolemia per day. Four days later, the changes of blood fat were tested, and to analyze the correlation of polymorphism of CETP gene I405V and base line blood fat with changes of blood fat after taking simvastatin. Results: 369 patients with abnormal blood fat were all involved in the result analysis. 1 The genotypic frequency of CETP-I405V polymorphism in north China patients with abnormal blood fat was 22.5%II gene, 50.0% IV gene, and 22.5% VV gene, respectively. 2 After taking simvastatin for 4 weeks, the triacylglycerol in II gene patients decreased at most, followed by IV gene, and the VV gene at least. The total cholesterol in the IV gene lessened 0.27mmol/L (P=0.01) compared with that in the II gene. The triacylglycerol in the VV gene reduced 0.40 mmol/L (P<0.01) compared with than in the II gene. The total cholesterol in the IV +VV gene decreased 0.31mmol/L (P<0.01) compared with that in the II gene. 3After adjusting the effects of age, sex and body mass index, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) lessened mostly after 4 weeks of taking drug in the II gene patients, decreased little in the IV+VV gene. The LDL-C reduced 0.27mmol/L (P=0.03) in the IV+VV gene compared with that in the II gene. However, there was insignificant difference of triacylglycerol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) in the different genotype patients. 4 The genotypic frequency accorded with the hardy-weinberg law or not was checked by the chi-square test. The base line bloods fat in different genetype and blood fat changes after taking drug were compared by the analysis of variance. The standard regression coefficient (β) of different genetype and base line blood fat and blood fat changes was compared by multiple element linear regression analysis. Conclusion: The II genotype carriers of the CETP -I405V polymorphisms respond better to simvastatin therapy. The CETP-I405V polymorphisms is one of the markers that can predict the individual difference in lipid adjusting of statin in patients with hypercholesterolemia in Beijing region.

33751071598	Prediction of 2-year outcome by combining TIMI myocardial perfusion grading with sum ST segment resolution in patients with acute myocardial infarction	Objective: To evaluate the value of combining TIMI myocardial perfusion (TMP) grading with sum ST segment resolution (sumSTR) in prediction of the 2-year outcome and heart function in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) after emergency percutaneous intervention (PCI). Methods: Seventy-seven consecutive patients of AMI with elevated ST segment, 62 males and 15 females, aged 63 ± 12 (30-91), underwent PCI, TMP grading was used in combination of electrocardiography to calculate the sumSTR so as to evaluate the effect of myocardial reperfusion. The patients with TMP grade 2-3 and sumSTR ≥30% were included in the group of better perfusion, and those with the TMP grade 0-1 and sumSTR < 30% were included in the group of lower perfusion. The cardiac events, including death, reinfarction, revasularization, angina pectoris, and heart failure were recorded. The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured by echocardiography 72 hours and 2 years after the PCI. Results There were 37 patients in the lower perfusion group and 39 patients in the better perfusion group. Cos regression showed that TMP grade 0-1 associated with suinSTR < 30% was an independent factor for 2-year cardiac events (RR = 13.186, 95% CI 2.149-80. 917, P = 0.005). The LVEDD 2 years after PCI was 60 mm ±4 mm, significantly higher than that 72 hours after PCI (53 mm ±4 mm. P < 0.01) in the lower perfusion group. The LVEDD increased by 7.1 mm ±1.9 mm two years after PCI in the lower perfusion group, significantly more than that in the better perfusion group (1.5 mm ±1.2 mm, P < 0.01). The myocardial perfusion after PCI was closely correlated with the extent of heart function improvement 2 years after (χ

33644980611	Prognosis of unprotected left main coronary artery stenting and the factors affecting the outcomes in Chinese	Background: The long term prognosis of unprotected left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenting is controversial This study was conducted to evaluate the immediate and long term outcomes of LMCA stenting in Chinese patients and to determine which factors affect the outcomes. Methods: From May 1997 to March 2003, 224 patients in 23 hospitals underwent elective unprotected LMCA stenting with bare metal stents. Their clinical records were analysed to ascertain immediate and long term outcomes of LMCA stenting as well as factors influencing the prognosis. Results: Stents were implanted into LMCA successfully in 223 cases (99.6 %). One death (0.5%) and one case of non-Q wave nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) occurred in hospital. The mean follow-up time was (15.6±12.3) months. Cardiac death developed in 10 cases (4.5%), noncardiac death in 2 cases (0.9%), nonfatal MI in 4 cases (1.8%), target lesion revascularization (TLR) of LMCA in 26 cases (11.7%) and TLR of nonLMCA in 37 cases (16.5%). Univariate analysis showed that cardiac death correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 40%), female gender and LMCA combined with multivessel disease; that major adverse cardiac events (MACE) correlated with LVEF < 40%, bifurcation lesion and incomplete revascularization. Logistic regression analysis revealed that LVEF < 40% and female gender were independent predictors of cardiac death and MACE. Follow-up angiography was performed in 102 cases (45.7%). The restenosis rate was 31.4%. Conclusions: Long-term outcomes of stenting for selected patients with unprotected LMCA stenosis is acceptable. It should be performed in inoperable or low risk patients with LVEF ≥ 40% and isolated LMCA disease or LMCA combined with multivessel diseases in whom complete revascularization can be obtained. ©2005-2008 Chinese Medical Journal, All Rights Reserved.

77954303545	The association between effort-reward imbalance and coronary atherosclerosis in a Chinese sample	Background Previous studies of job strain and coronary heart disease (CHD) have produced mixed findings. We aimed to examine the association between job stress evaluated by the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model and coronary atherosclerosis assessed by coronary angiography in a Chinese sample. Methods Three-hundred twenty participants accepting coronary angiography for the first time were enrolled in series. Job stressors were evaluated by the ERI model. The presence and severity of CHD were assessed by measuring the coronary artery stenosis (the presence of >50% luminal stenosis in one or more major coronary arteries). The association between job stressors and CHD was examined by multivariate analysis. Results Compared with the low-level group, high-level effort, overcommitment, and ERI increased CHD risk with odds ratio (OR) 2.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-5.0), 2.5 (95% CI: 1.2-5.0), 2.4 (95% CI: 1.2-4.9), respectively, after adjustment for confounders. They were also significantly positively correlated with the complexity of coronary artery lesions, respectively. Dose-response relationships were observed. Conclusions ERI was associated with coronary artery lesions in a sample of Chinese workers. Longitudinal research and interventional designs are needed to confirm the mechanism and to provide evidence for the prevention of CHD. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

84876591257	Clopidogrel resistance of patients with coronary artery disease and its correlation with platelet count and mean platelet volume	Objective: To explore the association between clopidogrel resistance (CR) as assessed by whole blood electrical impedance aggregometry (EIA) and platelet parameters. Methods: The prospective study comprised 152 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) on the therapy of clopidogrel. EIA employed adenosine diphosphate (ADP) as an inductor to measure platelet aggregation. CR was defined by spontaneous aggregation (electrical impedance ≥10 Ω). The subjects were divided into 2 groups of CR and clopidogrel sensitive (CS). Platelet parameters were measured by routine blood test. And their clinical data and outcomes were analyzed. Results: The prevalence of CR was 10.5% (n = 16). The ratio of patients with diabetes in CR group was higher than that in CS group (7/16 vs 29/136, P = 0.046). Platelet counts and mean platelet volume (MPV) were also higher in CR group than those in CS group ((241 ± 58) × 10

84898017841	Hospital quality improvement initiative for patients with acute coronary syndromes in China a cluster randomized, controlled trial	Background-Substantial evidence-practice gaps exist in the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in China. Clinical pathways are tools for improving ACS quality of care but have not been rigorously evaluated. Methods and Results-Between October 2007 and August 2010, a quality improvement program was conducted in 75 hospitals throughout China with mixed methods evaluation in a cluster randomized, controlled trial. Eligible hospitals were level 2 or level 3 centers routinely admitting >100 patients with ACS per year. Hospitals were assigned immediate implementation of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline based clinical pathways or commencement of the intervention 12 months later. Outcomes were several key performance indicators reflecting the management of ACS. The key performance indicators were measured 12 months after commencement in intervention hospitals and compared with baseline data in control hospitals, using data collected from 50 consecutive patients in each hospital. Pathway implementation was associated with an increased proportion of patients discharged on appropriate medical therapy, with nonsignificant improvements or absence of effects on other key performance indicators. Conclusions-Among hospitals in China, the use of a clinical pathway for the treatment of ACS compared with usual care improved secondary prevention treatments, but effectiveness was otherwise limited. An accompanying process evaluation identified several health system barriers to more successful implementation. Clinical Trial Registration-URL: http://www.anzctr.org.au/default.aspx.

62749109062	Diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia exacerbates vascular reverse remodeling of balloon-injured arteries in rat	Background: While hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, the effect of hyperhomocysteinemia on the vascular adventitia and vessel remodeling has not been clearly demonstrated. We investigated the effect of the hyperhomocysteinemia on adventitial hyperplasia and vascular remodeling following balloon injury in rats and the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Rats were fed with diet containing methionine for 4 weeks to increase plasma homocysteine before balloon injury. Vascular geometrical changes were assessed at different time points following balloon injury. The collagen deposition was determined by picrosirius red staining and immunohistochemical staining. Results: When compared with normal diet group, moderate hyperhomocysteinemia in methionine diet group significantly exacerbated adventitial hyperplasia at day 7 and collagen deposition mainly in the adventitia at day 28 following balloon injury. The increased plasma homocysteine level significantly increased collagen deposition in the adventitia. There was a negative correlation (r=-0.698; P <0.01) between the luminal area and the collagen content in the adventitia on day 28 following balloon injury. In cultured adventitial fibroblasts isolated from rat aorta, 100 μmol/L L-homocysteine (L-Hcy) significantly down-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity by 43% as determined by in vitro gelatin zymography (P <0.05) and up-regulated the expression of collagen type I by 187% (P <0.05) assessed by Western blotting. Conclusions: Hyperhomocysteinemia exacerbated vascular constrictive remodeling by accelerated neointima formation and collagen accumulation in the adventitia. Increased collagen deposition may be the underlying mechanism.

64149131621	Autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell transplantation improves vascular endothelial function in patients with myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction	Background: Endothelial functional disturbance is associated with risk factors of various cardiovascular diseases, mainly showing a decreased production of nitrogen monoxidum or abnormal function. Autologous bone marrow stem cell (BMSC) transplantation for heart repair has a certain effects. However, the effect of transplanted stem cells on vascular endothelial cell function is still unclear in early therapeutic period. Objective: To explore the influence of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells on vascular endothelial function in patients with myocardial infarction and left heart insufficiency following coronary artery transplantation. Design, time and setting: The opening clinical study was performed at the Institute of Department of Cardiology, Third Hospital, Peking University from January 2005 to December 2006. Participants: Sixteen patients with anterior myocardial infarction, who underwent reperfusion treatment and intracoronary stent at the Third Hospital, Peking University, were enrolled in this study. All patients aged 33-75 years old were divided into a cell transplantation group (n=8) and a control group (n=8) according to patient's will. Methods: Patients in both groups were subjected to standard percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and medical therapy. Subsequently, autologous bone marrow was collected from patients of the cell transplantation group. Bone marrow mononuclear stem cells were harvested using the density gradient centrifugation.

67649664384	Job stress and coronary heart disease: A case-control study using a Chinese population	Objectives: This study was to examine the association between job stress and coronary heart disease (CHD) in a Chinese population. Methods: The 388 participants aged 30 to 70 yr who received coronary angiography for suspected or known ischemic heart disease were enrolled in this series, which included 292 CHD cases and 96 controls. The job stress before CHD onset was measured by the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model. Results: In the results, compared with the baseline, high ERI, high extrinsic effort or high overcommitment increased the risk of CHD with odds ratios (OR) of 2.8, 2.7 and 2.8 respectively after adjustment for the traditional CHD risk factors, such as age, gender, primary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking, body mass index, CHD family history, educational level, and marital status. The combination of high ERI and high overcommitment led to the highest risk of CHD with adjusted OR 5.5. However, high reward reduced the risk of CHD with an adjusted OR of 0.4 in comparison to low reward. Dose-response relationships were also observed. Conclusions: Job stress evaluated by the ERI model significantly increased the risk of CHD, and it may be an important risk factor independent of the traditional risk factors of CHD in the Chinese population.

77951162302	Altered expression of microRNAs in the myocardium of rats with acute myocardial infarction	Background: MicroRNAs(miRNAs) are important cellular components and their dysfunction is associated with various diseases. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most serious cardiovascular diseases. Although several miRNAs are reported to be associated with AMI, more novel miRNAs are needed to further investigate and improve certainty. Methods: We applied a well-established acute myocardial infarction rat model and performed miRNAs microarray experiments upon the myocardium tissue of rats with AMI and under sham control. We identified the differentially expressed miRNAs and analyzed the function of miRNA targets, transcription factors, and host genes based on bioinformatics.Results: As a result, the levels of expression of seventeen miRNAs significantly deregulated, of which four miRNAs were further validated by qRT-PCR. In addition, we observed that the transcription factors, targets, and host genes of these deregulated miRNAs are enriched in cardiovascular-related functions.Conclusion: We found that the miRNAs expression level altered in rats with AMI and differentially expressed miRNAs may be novel biomarkers of AMI. © 2010 Shi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77951083378	Proteomic profiling reveals comprehensive insights into adrenergic receptor-mediated hypertrophy in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes	Myocardial adrenergic receptors (ARs) play important roles in cardiac hypertrophy. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of AR-mediated cardiac hypertrophy remains elusive to date. To gain full insight into how ARs are involved in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy, protein expression profiling was performed with comparative proteomics approach on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Forty-six proteins were identified as differentially expressed in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes induced by AR stimulation. To better understand the biological significance of the obtained proteomic data, we utilized the ingenuity pathway analysis tool to construct biological networks and analyze function and pathways that might associate with AR-mediated cardiac hypertrophy. Pathway analysis strongly suggested that ROS may be involved in the development of AR-mediated cardiac hypertrophy, which was then confirmed by further experimentation. The results showed that a marked increase in ROS production was detected in AR-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and blocking of ROS production significantly inhibited AR-mediated cardiac hypertrophy. We further proved that the ROS production was through NADPH oxidase or the mitochondrial electron transport chain and this ROS accumulation resulted in activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 leading to AR-mediated cardiac hypertrophy. These experimental results support the hypothesis, from the ingenuity pathway analysis, that AR-mediated cardiac hypertrophy is associated with the dysregulation of a complicated oxidative stress-regulatory network. In conclusion, our results provide a basis for understanding the detailed molecular mechanisms of AR-mediated cardiac hypertrophy. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

77956218126	Assessment of coronary artery flow velocity pattern as a long-term predictor of left ventricular function and cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention in anterior acute myocardial infarction	Background Coronary flow velocity (CFV) can be used to assess short-term left ventricular function recovery and the clinical prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We evaluated CFV as a predictor of long-term left ventricular function recovery and cardiac events in patients with anterior wall AMI. Methods and Results CFV pattern of the distal left anterior descending (LAD), wall motion score index (WMSI) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were recorded at the points of time within 24 hours, 3 days, 6 months, and 3 years after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 50 consecutive patients with anterior wall AMI. The clinical data were collected. Patients were divided into two groups based on diastolic deceleration time (DDT) 3 days after PCI. Compared with 3 days, LVEF and WMSI in group A (DDT>600 ms, n=20) improved in 6 months and 3 years (p<0.01), but they were unchanged in group B (DDT≤600 ms, n=30). The incidence of cardiac events was higher in group B than in group A during 6 months (p<0.01). With a 3-year follow up, the incidence of chronic heart failure was higher in group B than in group A (p= 0.009). Conclusion CFV could be used as a predictor of long-term left ventricular function recovery and cardiac events in patients with anterior wall AMI. © 2010 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.

We evaluated concentrations of the growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15at different stages and its potential screening value in 208 subjects. Plasma GDF-15 was measured by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. GDF-15 was positively correlated with the stages of HF (r=0.804, p<0.001). In distinguishing patients with stage B HF, the area under the curve was 0.873 (p<0.001). These findings indicate that GDF-15 concentration was elevated with the progressing stages of HFand might have potential screening implications for stage B HF. © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.

0036159095	Use of cutting balloons in coronary interventions	Objective. To study the efficacy and safety of cutting balloons in coronary interventions. Methods. Twenty-two patients with 23 narrowed coronary arteries and 25 lesions enrolled the study, 17 of whom had 18 diseased coronary arteries and 18 lesions were in-stent restenosis. The average time from previous stenting was 7.60 ± 3.53 months. The lesions were dilated with cutting balloons. Results. All of the lesions were dilated successfully by 5.16 ± 2.30 inflations of a cutting balloon. The mean total duration of balloon inflation was 233.96 ± 94.83 seconds at pressures up to 9.40 ± 1.96 bars. The severity of vascular stenosis was lessened substantially (89.64 ± 8.65% vs 17.60 ± 17.15%, P = 0.000) without severe complications. Three restenotic lesions were further dilated with conventional balloons, another one was stented again because of a dissection distal to the previous stent. Three primary lesions were stented for dissection or residual stenosis. Angina pectoris reoccurred in two patients in a mean follow-up period of 7.42 ± 6.87 (range 0.5 - 20) months. Conclusion. Cutting balloon dilation is an effective and safe choice in interventions for coronary disease especially for in-stent restenosis.

To investigate catestatin profiles, serial catestatin levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the first week after AMI in 50 patients. Catestatin levels reduced at admission and negatively correlated with heart rates; it increased significantly on the third day but remained decreased at 1 week and positively with blood pressure. In a subgroup of 20 patients admitted within 4 h after onset, circulating catestatin correlated inversely with norepinephrine. Catestatin might be involved in the course of AMI and act as a tool in monitoring the progression of AMI. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

79960192983	Mitofusin 2 inhibits angiotensin II-induced myocardial hypertrophy	Background and Objectives: Myocardial hypertrophy is a common clinical finding leading to heart failure and sudden death. Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), a hyperplasia suppressor protein, is downregulated in hypertrophic heart. This study examined the role of Mfn2 in myocardial hypertrophy and its potential signal pathway. Methods and Results: In in vitro studies, neonatal cardiac myocytes were isolated and cultured. Incubation of cultured cardiomycytes with angiotensin II (Ang II) inhibited gene expression of Mfn2; induced cell hypertrophy and protein synthesis; and activated protein kinase Akt. Pretreatment of cells with AdMfn2 - a replication-deficient adenoviral vector encoding rat Mfn2 gene - upregulated Mfn2 expression and subsequently attenuated Ang ll-induced cell hypertrophy; protein synthesis; and Akt activation. In in vivo studies, direct gene delivery of AdMfn2 into myocardium decreased the infusion of Ang ll-induced atrial natriuretic factor (ANF, a hypertrophic marker) expression and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. Consistently, upregulation of Mfn2 in myocardium decreased the thicknesses of anterior and posterior walls of left ventricle (LV) and the ratio of LV mass/body weight in Ang ll-treated rats. Of note, AdGFP (control for AdMfn2) did not affect the effects of Ang II in vitro or in vivo. Conclusions: Upregulation of Mfn2 inhibits Ang ll-induced myocardial hypertrophy. In this process, inhibition of Akt activation seems to play a significant role. These findings indicate Mfn2 is a critical protein in modulating myocyte hypertrophy. © The Author(s) 2011.

80051962950	Growth differentiation factor 15 in cardiovascular diseases: From bench to bedside	Context: Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is a novel cytokine showing close association with cardiovascular diseases. The biological mechanism and clinical use of GDF-15 in cardiovascular diseases have been well demonstrated. We review recent investigations from both basic research and clinical trials into the biological role of GDF-15. Methods: The data were obtained mainly from MedLine via PubMed and from our own investigations. Results: Laboratory investigations revealed that GDF-15 has biphasic effects on cellular survival by several signaling pathways. GDF-15 participates in several cardiovascular pathological processes such as cardiac remodeling, ischemia/reperfusion injury and atherosclerotic plaque formation. As well, GDF-15 was found a prognostic biomarker of heart failure and acute coronary syndrome. The evidence for diagnostic or therapeutic utility is poor. Conclusion: GDF-15 has great potential as a biomarker in cardiovascular diseases, especially for prognosis, and is seen as a myocardial protective cytokine, but the exact mechanism of GDF-15 in cardiovascular diseases remains unknown. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

81855168364	Catestatin is useful in detecting patients with stage B heart failure	Screening patients with stage B heart failure(HF) may be one strategy for reducing human morbidity. To describe catestatin levels in different stages of HF and evaluate the diagnostic utility of catestatin for detecting stage B HF, we included 300 patients. Catestatin, BNP testing and echocardiogram were performed. Our studies showed catestatin decreased gradually from stage A to C. There was significant difference between stage A and B. Cutoff value for detecting stage B HF was 19.73ng/ml for catestatin with 90% sensitivity and 50.9% specificity. These results may have implications in the new method to detect patients with stage B HF. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

82155185201	The Relationship Between Kidney Function and Angiographically-Derived SYNTAX Score	Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and is an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in patients with acute coronary syndromes. SYNTAX score (SXscore) can predict the outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the association between kidney function and SXscore has not been previously reported. Methods: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and SXscore were retrospectively collected in 2262 patients with established CAD undergoing coronary angiography at Peking University Third Hospital from March 2005 to September 2010. Ordinal logistic regression and Pearson and partial correlation were used to analyze the association between eGFR and SXscore. Results: Patients with renal dysfunction were older, more likely to be female, and have a history of hypertension and diabetes. The unadjusted correlation coefficient of eGFR and SXscore was -0.125 (P < 0.001).This remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or current smoking (r = -0.075, P = 0.019). Ordinal logistic regression showed that age, gender, diabetes, and eGFR exerted independent influences on SXscore. Conclusions: Kidney function was an independent predictor of SXscore in patients with established CAD. This helps explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease events and mortality in patients with renal dysfunction. Further prospective multicentre studies are needed to confirm this finding. © 2011 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

84857899626	Mechanistic insights into the link between visfatin gene C-1535T polymorphism and coronary artery disease: An in vitro study	Visfatin, a pro-inflammatory cytokine predominantly released from leucocytes, is correlated with coronary artery disease (CAD). We have previously reported that the -1535C>T polymorphism (rs1330082), which located on the promoter region of visfatin, was associated with decreased risk of CAD. Here, we investigated the underlying mechanism by which this polymorphism affects the genetic susceptibility to CAD. The difference of the promoter activities between -1535T variant and -1535C allele was tested by luciferase reporter gene assay. The difference of transcription factor binding activities between T and C allele was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In reporter gene assay, we showed that the T variant had a significantly reduced transcriptional activity compared with the C allele. The T-variant significantly attenuated the promoter binding affinity to nuclear transcription factors and this effect became much obvious after treatment with TNF-α. Moreover, competition experiment revealed that the retarded complex formed by T-1535- or C-1535-probe binding to nuclear extracts was nearly completely inhibited by unlabeled activator protein-1 (AP-1) specific probe, indicating that AP-1 might be the target nuclear effector. Taken together, our data provided potential mechanistic link between the visfatin -1535C>T polymorphism and reduced CAD risk. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Recent studies have identified that microRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of lipid metabolism, but little is known about the circulating levels of lipometabolism-related miRNAs and their relationship with the presence of CAD in patients with hyperlipidemia. Methods: In the present study, we enrolled a total of 255 hyperlipidemia patients with or without CAD and 100 controls with normal blood lipids. The plasma levels of four known lipometabolism-related miRNAs, miR-122, miR-370, miR-33a, and miR-33b were quantified by real-time quantitative PCR. Blood levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were determined. Furthermore, the severity of CAD was assessed with the Gensini score system based on the degree of luminal narrowing and its geographic importance. Results: Our results revealed for the first time that plasma levels of miR-122 and miR-370 were significantly increased in hyperlipidemia patients compared with controls, and the levels of miR-122 and miR-370 were positively correlated with TC, TG, and LDL-C levels in both hyperlipidemia patients and controls. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the increased levels of miR-122 and miR-370 were associated with CAD presence, even after adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, miR-122 and miR-370 levels were positively correlated with the severity of CAD quantified by the Gensini score. However, both miR-33a and miR-33b were undetectable in plasma. Conclusions: Our results suggest that increased plasma levels of miR-122 and miR-370 might be associated with the presence as well as the severity of CAD in hyperlipidemia patients. © 2012 Gao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84862267613	Predictive value of postprocedural leukocyte count on myocardial perfusion, left ventricular function and clinical outcomes in ST-elevated myocardial infarction after percutaneous coronary intervention	Background Baseline white blood cell (WBC) count was correlated with ischemic events occurrence in patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, circulating WBC count is altered after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between postprocedural WBC count and clinical outcomes in STEMI patients who underwent PCI. Methods A total of 242 consecutive acute STEMI patients who underwent successful primary PCI were enrolled and followed up for two years. WBC counts were measured within 12 hours after PCI. ST-segment resolution (ST-R) and myocardial blush grades (MBG) were evaluated immediately after PCI. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was obtained at baseline and 12-18 months after PCI. Results Postprocedural WBC count was an independent inverse predictor of ST-R (OR 0.80, P <0.0001) and MBG 3 (OR 0.82, P <0.0001). It was negatively correlated with LVEF (baseline r=-0.22, P=0.001; 12-18 months r=-0.29, P <0.0001). The best cutoff value of WBC for predicting death was determined to be 13.0×10

84862789829	Flavonols intake and the risk of coronary heart disease: A meta-analysis of cohort studies	Objective: Prospective cohort are inconsistent regarding the association between flavonols intake and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The aim was to perform a meta-analysis to determine whether an association exists between them in observational studies. Methods: We searched PUBMED and EMBASE databases for studies conducted from 1966 through January 2012. Data were independently abstracted by 2 investigators using a standardized protocol. Study-specific risk estimates were combined by using a random-effects model. Results: A total of nine general population cohorts with 216,908 participants and more than 5249 CHD cases were included in the meta-analysis. The summary relative risk (RR) did not indicate a significant association between the highest flavonols intake and reduced risk of CHD (summary RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.01). Furthermore, no significant association was found through the dose-response analysis (an increment of 20. mg/day, summary RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.90, 1.03). Conclusions: Our results do not support a protective role of flavonols intake against CHD. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84866028257	Folate and risk of coronary heart disease: A meta-analysis of prospective studies	Background and aims: Epidemiologic studies are inconsistent regarding the association between folate and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. The aim was to perform a meta-analysis to determine whether an association exists between folate and total CHD endpoints in prospective studies. Methods and results: We searched the PUBMED and EMBASE databases for studies conducted from 1966 through August 2010. Data were independently abstracted by 2 investigators using a standardized protocol. Study-specific risk estimates were combined by using a random effects model.A total of 14 studies were included in the meta-analysis: 7 studies on dietary folate intake and 8 studies on blood folate levels. For dietary intake, the summary relative risk (RR) indicated a significant association between the highest folate intake and reduced risk of CHD (summary RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.80). Furthermore, an increase in folate intake of 200 ug/day was associated with a 12% decrease in the risk of developing CHD (summary RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.94). For blood folate levels, we also found a borderline inverse association of highest blood folate levels on CHD risk (summary RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.53, 1.02); our dose-response analysis indicated that an increment in blood folate levels of 5 mmol/l was associated with an 8% decrease in the risk of developing CHD (summary RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.00). Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that dietary folate intake and blood folate level are inversely associated with CHD risk. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84866528463	Enhancing cellular uptake of activable cell-penetrating peptide-doxorubicin conjugate by enzymatic cleavage	The use of activable cell-penetrating peptides (ACPPs) as molecular imaging probes is a promising new approach for the visualization of enzymes. The cell-penetrating function of a polycationic cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) is efficiently blocked by intramolecular electrostatic interactions with a polyanionic peptide. Proteolysis of a proteinase-sensitive substrate present between the CPP and polyanionic peptide affords dissociation of both domains and enables the activated CPP to enter cells. This ACPP strategy could also be used to modify antitumor agents for tumor-targeting therapy. Here, we aimed to develop a conjugate of ACPP with antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX) sensitive to matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2/9) for tumor-targeting therapy purposes. The ACPP-DOX conjugate was successfully synthesized. Enzymatic cleavage of ACPP-DOX conjugate by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 indicated that the activation of ACPP-DOX occurred in an enzyme concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometry and laser confocal microscope studies revealed that the cellular uptake of ACPP-DOX was enhanced after enzymatic-triggered activation and was higher in HT-1080 cells (overexpressed MMPs) than in MCF-7 cells (under-expressed MMPs). The antiproliferative assay showed that ACPP had little toxicity and that ACPP-DOX effectively inhibited HT-1080 cell proliferation. These experiments revealed that the ACPP-DOX conjugate could be triggered by MMP-2/9, which enabled the activated CPP-DOX to enter cells. ACPP-DOX conjugate may be a potential prodrug delivery system used to carry antitumor drugs for MMP-related tumor therapy. © 2012 Shi et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84867614386	Association between fractional flow reserve and quantitative coronary angiography parameters in intermediate coronary artery stenosis	Objective: To explore the relationship between quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) parameters and fractional flow reserve (FFR) for identifying ideal angiographic parameters predictive of myocardial ischemia. Methods: The study included 121 lesions with QCA and FFR data from 106 patients [mean age; (63 ± 10) years]. The lesions were grouped into FFR > 0.75 group and FFR ≤ 0.75 group. Assessed parameters by QCA included percentage diameter stenosis, minimum luminal diameter (MLD), percentage area stenosis, minimum luminal area (MLA), reference vessel diameter (RVD) and lesion length (LL). Correlation analysis was used to identify the relationship between QCA parameters and FFR value, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine parameters predictive of FFR ≤ 0.75. Results: LL was significantly higher [(14.8 ± 7.9) mm vs. (10.7 ± 5.4) mm, P=0.024] while MLD [(1.47 ± 0.31) mm vs. (1.82 ± 0.51) mm, P=0.028], RVD [(2.30 ± 0.50) mm vs. (2.81 ± 0.64) mm, P=0.036], and MLA [(2.30 ± 1.50) mm

84869835737	Temporal changes and interaction of serum cytokines in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention	Objective: To investigate the temporal changes of serum cytokines IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and IL-10 immediately before and after primary PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and explore the interaction of these cytokines. Methods: A total of 59 STEMI patients were recruited. And their serum concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and IL-10 were measured by ELISA before primary PCI and 4-6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours and 7 days post-intervention. For each cytokine, the level at each time-point post-PCI was compared to that at pre-PCI. Correlation coefficient test was used to analyze the interactions of these four cytokines. Results: At 12 hours post-PCI, the median serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were higher than those before PCI (IL-6; 8.51 ng/L vs 6.76 ng/L, IL-8; 4.67 ng/L vs 2.95 ng/L, both P <0.05). At 4-6 hours and 12 hours post-PCI, the median values of MCP-1 were increasing significantly compared to those at pre-PCI (35.04 ng/L, 34.24 ng/L vs 30.45 ng/L, both P < 0.05) while those of IL-10 decreased (18.15 ng/L, 18.82 ng/L vs 20.95 ng/L, both P < 0.05). The levels of IL-6 and IL-10 at pre-PCI were associated with the Killip classification on admission (IL-6: r=0.293, P < 0.05; IL-10: r = -0.287, both P < 0.05). Except for IL-8, other cytokines had no significant relation with the time length from onset to admission (P > 0.05). Additionally, these four cytokines were not found to be related with the location and extension of myocardial infarction, ejection fraction and NT-proBNP. At each time-point, there were a positive relationship among the natural logarithms of the concentrations of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 (P < 0.01), all of which were inverse to the natural logarithm of the concentration of IL-10 (P < 0.01). Conclusions: The pro-inflammatory cytokines increase while the anti-inflammatory cytokines decrease after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. An imbalance of inflammatory cytokines may be present.

84869223047	Effects of advanced glycation end products on the secretion of proinflammatory chemokines in vascular smooth muscle cells	Objective: To investigate the effects of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on the secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and explore its possible intracellular signaling mechanism. Methods: Primary rat VSMCs were isolated and identified. VSMCs were treated with glycation serum albumin (GSA), an important component of AGEs, in series of concentrations and time. The role of MAPK and NF-κB inhibitors was confirmed. The levels of MCP-1 and IL-8 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: VSMCs were treated with GSA at the doses of 10 μg/ml, 100 μg/ml and 500 μg/ml respectively. In comparison with the control group, the levels of MCP-1 (13.01 ng/ml ± 0.12 ng/ml vs 7.02 ng/ml ± 0.26 ng/ml, P < 0.05) and IL-8 (12.6 ng/ml ± 0.86 ng/ml vs 3.07 ng/ml ± 0.35 ng/ml, P < 0.05) increased in the GSA-treated group, especially at the concentration of 100 μg/ml. After adjustment for cells proliferation, the levels of MCP-1 and IL-8 were still higher in the GSA-treated group. After a pretreatment of PDTC (10 μmol/L), SB203580 (5 μmol/L) and MG132 (10 μmol/L), the levels of MCP-1 and IL-8 decreased. However, it had no change when pretreated with PD98059 (20 μmol/L). Conclusion: GSA promotes the secretion of MCP-1 and IL-8 in VSMCs. Such an effect is not dependent on cellular proliferation. It may be realized through an activation of NF-κB by p38MAPK-sensitive intracellular signaling pathway. Copyright © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84870459678	Prognostic values for in-hospital event rate of early E/Em in patients with acute myocardial infarction	Objective: To assess the prognostic values for in-hospital event rate of tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) parameter (E/Em) after acute myocardial infarction. Methods: A total of 289 patients with acute myocardial infarction were retrospectively examined. Their clinical data and echocardiograms were obtained. Clinical events were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups according to the value of ratio of early transmitral flow velocity to early diastolic velocity of mitral annulus (E/Em); Group E/Em < 10 (n = 152) and Group E/Em ≥ 10 (n = 137). Clinical characteristics, echocardiographic parameters and the rate of cardiac events were compared. Predictors of heart failure were identified by multivariate Logistic regression analysis. Results: On echocardiography, the patients with an E/Em ratio ≥ 10 had statistically larger left atrial diameter [(39.1 ± 6.2) vs (36.0 ± 4.4) mm, P = 0.000] and left ventricular end diastolic diameter [(52.3 ± 7.3)vs (49.2 ± 5.2) mm, P = 0.000]. Worse systolic functions were found in group E/Em≥10; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [(48.3 ± 11.7)% vs (56.7 ± 9.7)%, P = 0.000]. Systolic velocities of mitral annulus (Sm) [(6.6 ± 1.7) vs (8.6 ± 2.2) cm/s, P = 0.000]. Em [(6.4 ± 1.9) vs (9.4 ± 2.4) cm/s, P = 0.000] was statistically lower than that of E/Em < 10 group. Killip classes on admission were statistically higher in group E/Em 5 = 10 than those of the other group [(1.7 ± 0.9) vs (1.2 ± 0.6), P = 0.000]. So were as the ratio of heart failure(38.5% vs 13.8%, P = 0.000) and in-hospital mortality rate (4.4% vs 0.8%, P = 0.000). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the independent risk factors of heart failure included the value of E/Em and LVEF. Conclusion: Early E/Em is probably a powerful predictor for left ventricular remodeling and in-hospital heart failure in patients after acute myocardial infarction. © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84874147078	Predictive value of antiplatelet resistance on early stent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome	Background Despite outstanding antiplatelet properties of aspirin and clopidogrel, some patients taking these drugs continue to suffer complications. Antiplatelet resistance appears to be a new prognostic factor in acute coronary syndrome patients for clinical events associated with stent thrombosis (ST). However, there is no optimal method to identify it and assess its correlation to clinical outcomes. This study sought to evaluate the predictive value of antiplatelet resistance assessed by whole blood impedance aggregometry for the risk of early ST in patients with acute coronary syndrome who underwent coronary stenting. Methods Platelet responses to aspirin and clopidogrel in 86 patients with acute coronary syndrome were measured by whole blood impedance aggregometry. Spontaneous platelet aggregation was defined as antiplatelet resistance identified by the increased electrical impedance. The clinical endpoint was early stent thrombosis during 30-day follow-up after coronary stenting. Results The prevalence of aspirin resistance, clopidogrel resistance and dual resistance of combined clopidogrel and aspirin resistance were 19.8%, 12.8% and 5.8% respectively. Diabetes, female and higher platelet counts were more frequently detected in clopidogrel-resistant and dual-resistant patients. During 30-day follow-up, the patients with clopidogrel resistance and dual resistance had higher incidence of early stent thrombosis (18.2% vs. 1.3%, 40.0% vs. 1.2%, P <0.05). Binary Logistic Regression analysis indicated that dual resistance remained an independent predicator for early stent thrombosis (odds ratio 34.064, 95% CI 1.919-604.656, P=0.016). Conclusions Antiplatelet resistance assessed by whole blood impedance aggregometry is paralleled to clinical events, and dual antiplatelet resistance is an independent predicator for early stent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome. As a physiological assessment of platelet reactivity, whole blood impedance aggregometry is a convenient and accurate option for measuring antiplatelet resistance and hence predicting early stent thrombosis.

84875313009	Impact of uncontrolled blood pressure on diagnostic accuracy of coronary flow reserve for detecting significant coronary stenosis in hypertensive patients	Background Impaired coronary flow reserve (CFR) in patients with hypertension may be caused by epicardial coronary stenosis or microvascular dysfunction. Antihypertensive treatment has been shown to improve coronary microvascular dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) on diagnostic accuracy of CFR for detecting significant coronary stenosis. Methods A total of 98 hypertensive patients scheduled for coronary angiography (CAG) due to chest pain were studied. Of them, 45 patients had uncontrolled BP (defined as the office BP ≥140/90 mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) in general hypertensive patients, or ≥130/80 mmHg in hypertensive individuals with diabetes mellitus), and the remaining 53 patients had well-controlled BP. CFR was measured in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) during adenosine triphosphate-induced hyperemia by non-invasive transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE) within 48 hours prior to CAG. Significant LAD stenosis was defined as >70% luminal narrowing. Diagnostic accuracy of CFR for detecting significant coronary stenosis was analyzed with a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results CFR was significantly lower in patients with uncontrolled BP than in those with well-controlled BP (2.1±0.6 vs. 2.6±0.9, P <0.01). Multivariate linear regression analysis of the study showed that the value of CFR was independently associated with the angiographically determined degree of LAD stenosis (β=-0.445, P <0.0001) and the presence of uncontrolled BP (β=-0.272, P=0.014). With a receiver operating characteristic analysis, CFR <2.2 was the optimal cut-off value for detecting LAD stenosis in all hypertensive patients (AUC 0.83, 95%CI 0.75-0.91) with a sensitivity of 75%, a specificity of 78%, and an accuracy of 77%. A significant reduction of diagnostic specificity was observed in patients with uncontrolled BP compared with those with well-controlled BP (67% vs. 93%, P=0.031). Conclusions CFR measurement by TTDE is valuable in the diagnosis of significant coronary stenosis in hypertensive patients. However, the diagnostic specificity is reduced in patients with uncontrolled BP.

84876507792	Correlation between antiplatelet resistance and recurrent cardiac ischemic events of patients with acute myocardial infarction	Objective: To evaluate the predictive value of antiplatelet resistance assessed by whole blood electronic impedance aggregometry (EIA) for the risk of recurrent cardiac ischemic events in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who underwent coronary stenting. Methods: We enrolled 109 patients with AMI, 72 (66.1%) men and 37(33.9%) women with mean age (63 ± 12) years, who were treated with aspirin and clopidogrel daily after coronary stenting. EIA used arachidonic acid (AA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) as inductors to measure platelet aggregation inhibited by aspirin and clopidogrel respectively. The subjects were divided into four groups: pure aspirin resistant group (AR, electrical impedance >0 Ω), pure clopidogrel resistant group (CR, electrical impedance ≥10 Ω), dual resistant group (DR) and dual sensitive group (DS). The primary outcomes were recurrent cardiac ischemic events during the 12-month follow-up. Results: Antiplatelet resistance occurred more often in patients with type 2 diabetes (P=0.027). The platelet counts (PLT) were higher in antiplatelet resistant groups than DS group (P=0.013). During the 12-month follow-up, the antiplatelet resistant patients had a higher incidence of recurrent cardiac ischemic events and stent thrombosis (ST) than the patients without (12.5%, 10.0%, 50.0% vs 3.8%, P=0.036; 6.3%, 10.0%, 50.0% vs 1.3%, P=0.000; respectively). Binary logistic regression indicated that dual resistance remained an independent predicator of recurrence cardiac ischemic events and ST (OR 5.99, 95% CI 1.05-34.34, P=0.045; OR 6.36, 95% CI 1.13-35.78, P=0.036; respectively). Conclusions: As a physiological assessment of platelet reactivity, EIA is a convenient and accurate option for measuring aspirin resistance. Antiplatelet resistance assessed by EIA is paralleled to clinical events. Dual resistance is an independent predicator for ST and recurrence cardiac ischemic events in patients with AMI.

84876950873	Usefulness of lumen area parameters determined by intravascular ultrasound to predict functional significance of intermediate coronary artery stenosis	Background Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in China. Percutaneous coronary intervention is a recent milestone technology for treatment coronary artery disease. However, clinical decision making for patients with intermediate coronary stenosis is still controversial. We designed this study to assess the optimal intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) criteria for predicting functional significance of intermediate coronary lesions. Methods We enrolled 141 patients with 165 intermediate coronary lesions located in vessels with a diameter ≥2.50 mm. IVUS of intermediate coronary lesions were performed before intervention. Pressure-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) was measured at maximal hyperemia induced by adenosine infusion. An FFR 0.80 was considered as abnormal functional significance. Results For the overall 165 lesions, the mean FFR value was 0.84±0.09. The diameter of the stenosis by visual estimation on angiogram was (59.63±11.29)%. Minimum lumen diameter (MLD), minimum lumen area (MLA) and plaque burden (PB) were (2.00±0.36) mm, (3.88±1.34) mm

84876968153	miRNA-711-SP1-collagen-I pathway is involved in the anti-fibrotic effect of pioglitazone in myocardial infarction	Although microRNAs (miRNAs) have been intensively studied in cardiac fibrosis, their roles in drug-mediated anti-fibrotic therapy are still unknown. Previously, Pioglitazone attenuated cardiac fibrosis and increased miR-711 experimentally. We aimed to explore the role and mechanism of miR-711 in pioglitazone-treated myocardial infarction in rats. Our results showed that pioglitazone significantly reduced collagen-I levels and increased miR-711 expression in myocardial infarction heart. Pioglitazone increased the expression of miR-711 in cardiac fibroblasts, and overexpression of miR-711 suppressed collagen-I levels in angiotensin II (Ang II)-treated or untreated cells. Transfection with antagomir-711 correspondingly abolished the pioglitazone-induced reduction in collagen-I levels. Bioinformatics analysis identified SP1, which directly promotes collagen-I synthesis, as the putative target of miR-711. This was confirmed by luciferase assay and western blot analysis. Additionally, increased SP1 expression was attenuated by pioglitazone in myocardial infarction heart. Furthermore, transfection of antagomir-711 attenuated pioglitazone-reduced SP1 expression in cardiac fibroblasts with or without Ang II stimulation. We conclude that pioglitazone up-regulated miR-711 to reduce collagen-I levels in rats with myocardial infarction. The miR-711-SP1-collagen-I pathway may be involved in the anti-fibrotic effects of pioglitazone. Our findings may provide new strategies for miRNA-based anti-fibrotic drug research. © 2013 The Author(s).

84879992522	Heat Shock Protein 70 Acts as a Potential Biomarker for Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure	Early identification for heart failure (HF) may be useful for disease modifying treatment in order to reduce heart disease progression or even to reverse it. In our previous studies, we have revealed a group of heat shock proteins (HSPs) which might be related to neonatal rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by proteomic approach. Here, we confirm that HSPs, including HSP27 and HSP70, altered in the early stage of cardiac remodeling in vivo animal model. Furthermore, plasma concentrations of those HSPs and their potential screening value were evaluated at different stages in 222 patient subjects. Plasma HSP27, HSP70 and HSP90 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results indicate that HSP70 was positively correlated to the severity (progression) of HF (r = 0.456, p<0.001). The area under the rate of change (ROC) curve was 0.601 (p = 0.017) in patients with stage B HF and 0.835 (p<0.001) in those with stage C HF. However, HSP27 and HSP90 did not display significant changes in any stage of HF in this study. Taken together, plasma concentrations of HSP70 elevated with the progression of HF and might act as a potential screening biomarker for early diagnosis of HF. © 2013 Li et al.

84883285447	Low density lipoprotein cholesterol level inversely correlated with coronary flow velocity reserve in patients with Type 2 diabetes	Objectives: To evaluate the association of coronary artery endothelial function and plasma levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Methods: We investigated 90 participants from our institution between October 2007 to March 2010: non-DM (n = 60) and DM (n = 30). As an indicator of coronary endothelial dysfunction, we used non-invasive Doppler echocardiography to quantify coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) in the distal part of the left descending artery after rest and after intravenous adenosine administration. Results: Plasma level of LDL-C was significantly higher in patients with DM than in non-DM (3.21 ± 0.64 vs. 2.86 ± 0.72 mmo/L, P < 0.05), but HDL-C level did not differ between the groups (1.01 ± 0.17 vs. 1.05 ± 0.19 mmo/L). Furthermore, the CFVR value was lower in DM patients than non-diabetics (2.45 ± 0.62 vs. 2.98 ± 0.68, P < 0.001). Plasma levels of LDL-C were negatively correlated with CFVR in all subjects (r = -0.35, P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.52 - -0.15) and in the non-DM (r = -0.29, P < 0.05; 95% CI: -0.51 - -0.05), with an even stronger negative correlation in the DM group (r = -0.42, P < 0.05; 95% CI: -0.68 - -0.06). Age (β = -0.019, s = 0.007, sβ = -0.435, 95% CI: -0.033 - -0.005, P = 0.008), LDL-C (β = -0.217, s = 0.105, sβ = -0.282, 95% CI: -0.428 - -0.005, P = 0.045) remained independently correlated with CFVR in the DM group. However, we found no correlation between HDL-C level and CFVR in any group. Conclusions: Diabetes may contribute to coronary artery disease (CAD) by inducing dysfunction of the coronary artery endothelium. Increased LDL-C level may adversely impair coronary endothelial function in DM. HDL-C may lose its endothelial-protective effects, in part as a result of pathological conditions, especially under abnormal glucose metabolism. ©2013 JGC All rights reserved.

The aim of the present study was to examine the potential effects of atorvastatin loading prior to primary PCI on coronary endothelial function and inflammatory factors in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A total of 60 patients with STEMI were randomized into three groups: Loading dose (80 mg atorvastatin prior to PCI; n=20), regular dose (20 mg atorvastatin prior to PCI; n=20) and control (without atorvastatin prior to PCI; n=20). The plasma samples were collected prior to, and immediately, 6 and 24 h after PCI in all the patients.The plasma concentrations of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS),nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were examined using ELISA. The plasma eNOS levels immediately and 24 h after PCI were significantly higher in the regular dose group compared with the other groups. However, there were no significant differences in the plasma eNOS concentration prior to and 6 h after PCI, or in the plasma NO concentration at any of the time-points among the three groups. The plasma IL-6 levels prior to PCI were significantly lower in the loading dose group compared with the other groups; however, there were no significant differences in the plasma concentration of IL-6following PCI or in the concentrations of TNF-α and ICAM-1 at any of the time-points among the three groups. In conclusion, atorvastatin loading in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI may not have protective effects on endothelial function and the inflammatory reaction.

84891843243	Current status of morning blood pressure control and medication of hypertensive patients in Beijing	Objective: To explore the current status of morning blood pressure and medication of hypertensive patients in Beijing. Methods: This study included 2187 hypertensive patients who visited the ambulance of our cardiology department in the morning (7:00-10:00) from March 2012 to April 2012. Patients were divided into three groups: no antihypertensive agent group, single antihypertensive drug therapy group (include CCB, ARB, ACEI, β-blocker) and combined drug therapy group at least one month. Blood pressure control rate was compared among the groups. Results: Target blood pressure was not reached in 1193 patients (54.6%), most patients took CCB and the target blood pressure was not reached in 61.7% (295/478) patients taking CCB. There was no significant difference on target blood pressure uncontrolled rate among the four single drug subgroups (CCB, ARB, ACEI, p-blocker). The blood pressure uncontrolled rate was 46.3% (63/136) for amlodipine, 70.5% (55/78) for nifedipine and 73.8% (31/42) for felodipine. There OR of uncontrolled blood pressure rate was 0.36 (amlodipine vs. nifedipine, 95% CI: 0.20-0.65) and 0.31% (amlodipine vs. felodipine, 95% CI: 0.14-0.66). Conclusion: The morning blood pressure uncontrolled rate is high in hypertensive patients visiting Beijing tertiary hospitals. Amlodipine is possible superior to nifedipine and felodipine on morning blood pressure control in this patient cohort. Copyright © 2013 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84896324190	Association between serum uric acid level and the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease	Background Many studies have shown that the serum uric acid (SUA) level is one of the cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of the study is to evaluate the relationship between SUA levels and the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) assessed by angiography and the Syntax score in patients with obstructive CAD. Methods Participants who visited our hospital for a coronary angiography, from December 2007 to September 2012, were eligible for this analysis. SUA and other blood parameters after at least 12-hour fast were determined. First, the patients were divided into tertiles according to their Syntax scores (low Syntax score group: Syntax score ≤10.0; moderate Syntax score group: 10.0 <Syntax score ≤18.0; high Syntax score group: Syntax score >18.0). Second, to clarify the association between SUA levels and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), all patients were divided into two subgroups on the basis of SUA levels. The cutoff value of SUA was defined by diagnostic criteria of hyperuricemia. Patients were separated into normal SUA group (n=251, with SUA <416 μmol/L for men and SUA <357 μmol/L for women) and high SUA group (n=96, with SUA ≥416 μmol/L for men and SUA ≥357 μmol/L for women). All participants were followed for a mean of 22.0 months (1-75 months, interquartile range: 28 months) for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including all-cause death, recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction (re-MI) and recurrent percutaneous coronary intervention (re-PCI). Results A total of 347 patients were registered for the study. The SUA levels in the high Syntax score group were significantly higher than that of the moderate Syntax score group and the low Syntax score group ((392.3±81.6) μmol/L vs. (329.9±71.0) μmol/L, P <0.001; (392.3±81.6) μmol/L vs. (311.4±64.7) μmol/L, P <0.001). The SUA level was positively correlated not only with the Syntax score (r=0.421, P <0.001; 95% CI: 0.333-0.512), but also with the number of diseased vessels (r=0.298, P <0.001; 95% CI: 0.194-0.396). After multiple linear regression analysis, SUA levels were identified to be independently correlated with a high Syntax score (B=0.033, 95% CI 0.023-0.042, P <0.001). Compared with the normal SUA subgroup, the high SUA subgroup tended to have a higher Syntax score (19.9±8.7 vs. 13.6±7.5, P <0.001) and more multi-vessel disease (70.8% vs. 46.6%, P <0.001). Follow-up data showed a higher incidence of MACE in the high SUA subgroup (20.8% vs. 6.0%, P <0.001). Binary Logistic regression analysis indicated that the elevated SUA can predict the long-term prognosis of patients with obstructive CAD (OR=2.968, 95% CI 1.256-7.011, P=0.013). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly lower event-free survival rate in patients with high SUA levels than in the normal SUA subgroup (79.2% vs. 94.0%, Log rank=17.645, P <0.001). Conclusions SUA levels were independently associated with the severity of CAD in patients with obstructive CAD. An elevated SUA is associated with cardiovascular events and may be useful as a biomarker of the severity of CAD.

84898063190	Growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 blocks norepinephrineinduced myocardial hypertrophy via a novel pathway involving inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation	Accumulating evidence suggests that growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is associated with the severity and prognosis of various cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect of GDF-15 on the regulation of cardiac remodeling is still poorly understood. In this present study, we demonstrate that GDF-15 blocks norepinephrine (NE)-induced myocardial hypertrophy through a novel pathway involving inhibition of EGFR transactivation. Both in vivo and in vitro assay indicate that NE was able to stimulate the synthesis of GDF-15. The up-regulation of GDF-15 feedback inhibits NE-induced myocardial hypertrophy, including quantitation of [

84902467008	Soluble CD40 Ligand is associated with angiographic severity of coronary artery disease in patients with acute coronary syndrome	Background Recently, studies have disclosed soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) during atherosclerosis development and plaque destabilization. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that sCD40L levels are higher in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients with a greater extent of angiographic coronary involvement. Methods This cross-sectional study examined ACS patients who underwent coronary angiography by measuring their sCD40L levels. In order to estimate the serum levels of sCD40L, 10 ml of peripheral venous blood was drawn within 24 hours of admission. sCD40L levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, RapidBio, West Hills, CA, USA). Demographic data, presence of concomitant diseases, ACS characteristics, and angiographic findings were evaluated. A review of medical records and patient interviews were conducted to assess coronary risk factors. And the severity of coronary artery disease was evaluated using the Gensini score index. Results Two hundred and eighty-nine patients were included in the study, of whom 186 were male, with an average age of 64.1±10.0 years. Median sCD40L levels were 1.7 ng/ml (0.3-7.3 ng/ml) and Gensini scores were 50 (0-228). After adjusting for demographic variables and cardiovascular risk factors, the Gensini score was associated with the natural logarithm of the sCD40L level (Coefficient b=0.002, 95% CI 0.000-0.003, P=0.029). Conclusion sCD40L levels were independently associated with angiographic severity of coronary artery disease in patients with ACS.

84902661664	Beneficial effects of muscone on cardiac remodeling in a mouse model of myocardial infarction	Musk has been traditionally used in East Asia to alleviate the symptoms of angina pectoris. However, it remains unclear as to whether muscone, the main active ingredient of musk, has any beneficial effects on persistent myocardial ischemia in vivo. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether muscone can improve cardiac function and attenuate myocardial remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI) in mice. Mice were subjected to permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery to induce MI, and then randomly treated with muscone (2 mg/kg/day) or the vehicle (normal saline) for 3 weeks. Sham-operated mice were used as controls and were also administered the vehicle (normal saline). Treatment with muscone significantly improved cardiac function and exercise tolerance, as evidenced by the decrease in the left ventricular end-systolic diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, as well as an increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular fractional shortening and time to exhaustion during swimming. Pathological and morphological assessments indicated that treatment with muscone alleviated myocardial fibrosis, collagen deposition and improved the heart weight/body weight ratio. Muscone inhibited the inflammatory response by reducing the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and nuclear factor (NF)-κB. Treatment with muscone also reduced myocardial apoptosis by enhancing Bcl-2 and suppressing Bax expression. Muscone also induced the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Our results demonstrate that muscone ameliorates cardiac remodeling and dysfunction induced by MI by exerting anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects in the ischemic myocardium.

84904466842	Prognostic value of coronary artery calcium score in patients with stable angina pectoris after percutaneous coronary intervention	Objectives: To evaluate the prognostic value of the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score in patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: A total of 334 consecutive patients with SAP who underwent first PCI following multi-slice computer tomography (MSCT) were enrolled from our institution between January 2007 and June 2012. The CAC score was calculated according to the standard Agatston calcium scoring algorithm. Complex PCI was defined as use of high pressure balloon, kissing balloon and/or rotablator. Procedure-related complications included dissection, occlusion, perforation, no/slow flow and emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. Main adverse cardiac events (MACE) were defined as a combined end point of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization and rehospitalization for cardiac ischemic events. Results: Patients with a CAC score > 300 (n = 145) had significantly higher PCI complexity (13.1% vs. 5.8%, P = 0.017) and rate of procedure-related complications (17.2% vs. 7.4%, P = 0.005) than patients with a CAC score ≤ 300 (n = 189). After a median follow-up of 22.5 months (4-72 months), patients with a CAC score ≤ 300 differ greatly than those patients with CAC score > 300 in cumulative non-events survival rates (88.9 vs. 79.0%, Log rank 4.577, P = 0.032). After adjusted for other factors, the risk of MACE was significantly higher [hazard ratio (HR): 4.3, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 2.4-8.2, P = 0.038] in patients with a CAC score > 300 compared to patients with a lower CAC score. Conclusions: The CAC score is an independent predictor for MACE in SAP patients who underwent PCI and indicates complexity of PCI and procedure-related complications. ©2014 JGC All rights reserved.

84906654666	Analysis of urinary methylated nucleosides of patients with coronary artery disease by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry	Rationale In recent years, methylated nucleosides have been considered to be potential biomarkers to human diseases. The early diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) is an unsolved problem in clinical cardiology. The aim of our study is to evaluate whether urinary methylated nucleosides can serve as useful biomarkers for CAD. METHODS A solid-phase extraction (SPE) column was used for extraction and purification of methylated nucleosides in urine, and high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) was employed for specific, sensitive and rapid determination of the urinary methylated nucleosides from patients with cardiac events.

84922264811	Association between peak neutrophil count, clopidogrel loading dose, and left ventricular systolic function in patients with primary percutaneous coronary intervention	Inflammation plays an important role in plaque development and left ventricular remodeling during acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Clopidogrel may exhibit some anti-inflammatory properties and high loading dose of clopidogrel results in improved clinical outcomes in patients with AMI. 357 patients who received successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention from January 2008 to March 2011 in Peking University Third Hospital were included in this study. Different loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg, 450 mg, or 600 mg) was given at the discretion of the clinician. Neutrophils reached their peak values on the first day after AMI. Higher levels of peak neutrophil and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were found in patients of low clopidogrel loading dose group (300 mg or 450 mg). After adjusting for the related confounders, a logistic regression model showed that low clopidogrel loading dose remained an independent predictor of low LVEF (LVEF ≤ 50%) [OR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.03-3.79, P = 0.04]. Low clopidogrel loading dose was associated with higher peak neutrophil count and poor left ventricular systolic function, suggesting an important role of clopidogrel loading dose in the improvement of left ventricular function and high loading dose may exhibit better anti-inflammatory properties.
