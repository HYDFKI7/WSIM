24744449129	Study on the role of interleukin-4 in experimental murine systemic candidiasis	In order to investigate the role of interleukin-4 (IL-4) in experimental murine systemic Candidiasis. we created the intact and dexamethasone-induced immunosuppressed murine systemic Candidiasis models. In these models, two-site ELISA and RT-PCR were applied to determine the level of IL-4 protein and mRNA expression in spleens respectively, clone forming units (CPUs) of infected kidneys were determined with the plating dilution method, and mean survival time (MST) of the mice was recorded. The results showed that, when compared with the controls, protein level of IL-4 increased in both intact mice infected with lethal doses of yeast (day 3, P<0.05; day 7, P< 0.001) and immunosuppressed mice infected with sublethal doses of yeast (day 3, P>0.05) day 7, P<0.05). Furthermore, the level of IL-4 was higher on day 7 than on day 3 after infection (P< 0.001 and P<0.05 respectively in two groups). The tendency of IL-4mRNA expression was similar with that of IL-4 protein. As for fungal loads in kidneys, CPUs were significantly higher on day 7 than on day 3 after infection (P<0.001 in both groups). Mice in both groups succumbed to infection within several days. It was suggested that IL-4 might play a promoting role in the development of murine systemic Candidiasis.

24944482668	A Study on the Expression of Interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12 P35, P40 mRNA in the Psoriatic Lesions	To investigate the possible role of interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12 in the pathogenesis of psoriatic lesions and to supply theoretical basis for the gene therapy for psoriasis, the expression of IL-10 and IL-12 P35, P40 mRNA in 12 cases of psoriatic lesions and 6 normal skin tissues was detected by using RT-PCR technique. The results showed that the expression of IL-10 mRNA in the psoriatic lesions was significantly lower than that in the normal skin tissues (P<0. 001). The expression of IL-12 P35 was positive both in the psoriatic lesions and in the normal skin tissues. IL-12 P40 mRNA was expressed positively only in the psoriatic lesions but negatively in the normal skin tissues. It was suggested that IL-12 might take an important role in the occurrence and progression of psoriasis, but IL-10 might have certain role in the regression of psoriasis.

27644503594	The expression of Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 mRNA in local tissues of model of oropharyngeal candidiasis in mice	To investigate the expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and 4 mRNA in local tissues of model of oropharyngeal candidiasis in mice and to explore the potential role of TLR2 and TLR4 in earlier period of immune response, a murine model of oropharyngeal candidiasis inoculated by cotton wool balls saturated with candida albicans was established. Mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points and the oropharyngeal tissues were excised. The expression of TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The results showed that low level of TLR2/4 mRNA could be detected in oropharyngeal tissues, but they were markedly up-regulated 6 h after inoculation, peaking after 12-24 h. Tissue TLR4 mRNA was gradually down-regulated 24-48 h, while TLR2 mRNA levels remained high up to the 72nd h. These data suggested that oropharyngeal infection of Candida albicans could result in up-regulation of TLR2/4 mRNA expression in local tissues, which might play important roles in earlier period of immune response.

27644510059	Clinical identification of common species of dermatophytes by PCR and PCR-RFLP	To find a fast and efficient way of identifying seven common dermatophytes in clinical practice, we used the techniques of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) targeting Topoisomerase II gene. The DMA of 7 dermatophytes, along with Candida albicans, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus flavus were amplified by consensus primer dPsD1. They were then subjected to a second PCR with primers dPsD2 and species-specific primers PsT and PsME separately. 6 of the products generated by dPsD2 were digested with restriction enzyme Hinc II. DNA fragments of 3390 bp and 2380 bp was amplified by using consensus primer dPsD1 and dPsD2 from the genomic DNA of each dermatophyte species separately. By combining the results of the two species-specific primer sets (PsT and PsME) , all species of dermatophyte yielded unique sizes-set of PCR products expect for T. mentagrophytes and T. tonsurans. From the restriction profiles of Hinc II , 6 of the 7 dermatophytoses were diagnosed to species level including T. mentagrophytes and T. tonsurans. By combining the results of the PCR and PCR-RFLP, the 7 common dermatophytes can be identified to species level. It is conclude that the multiplex PCR and PCR-RFLP identification targeting the DNA topoisomerase II gene is rapid and efficient.

By using RT-PCR technique, the expression of CD80/CD86 and CTLA-4 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were semiquantitatively detected in 32 patients with active SLE. The results showed that the percentage of positive CD86 expression in active SLE was increased significantly as compared with normal controls (90.63% vs 60.00%, P<0.01). The mean level of CD86 mRNA expression in active SLE group was markedly higher than in the normal controls (0.6410 + 0.0174 vs 0.4510 + 0.0402, F<0.001). Compared with normal controls, the percentage of positive CTLA-4 expression and the mean level of CTLA-4 mRNA expression in active SLE group were both increased significantly (both P<0. 01). There was no statistical differences in positive rate of CD80 and the average level of CD80 mRNA between the two groups (both P>0.05). It was concluded that the aberrant expression of CD86 and CTLA-4 might play an important role in the activity and development of SLE.

27644551321	Study on the expression of IL-18, AcPL and IL-18BP mRNA in the psoriatic lesions	To investigate the role of IL-18 and IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, PT-PCR was used to semi-quantitatively analyze the mRNA expression of IL-18, AcPL (accessory protein-like) and IL-18BP in 12 psoriatic lesions and in 6 normal skin tissues. The results showed that IL-18 and AcPL mRNA were present in all specimens from 6 normal skin and 12 pieces of psoriatic skin, and IL-18 and AcPL showed relatively stronger intensity in the psoriatic skin compared with those seen in normal skin (P<0.01). Amplified bands indicating the expression of IL-18BP mRNA were weakly positive in all samples of normal skin. In contrast, the PCR products for IL-18BP were distinctly visible in all specimens of psoriatic lesions (P<0.01). These findings demonstrate that IL-18 is constitutively synthesized by human keratinocytes and involved in the development of the Th1 response in psoriatic lesions, and its bioactivity appears to be closely regulated by cutaneous inflammation.

27644579847	Expression of CC chemokine ligand 20 and CC chemokine receptor 6 mRNA in patients with psoriasis vulgaris	In order to explore the possible role of CC chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) and its receptor CC chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the expression levels of mRNA of them in psoriatic lesions were investigated. The skin biopsies were collected from skin lesions in 35 cases of psoriasis vulgaris and 18 normal controls. RT-PCR was used to semi-quantitatiyely analyze the mRNA expression of CCL20 and CCR6 in the psoriatic lesions and the normal skin tissues. The results showed that the mRNA of CCL20 and CCR6 was present in every specimen. The expression levels of CCL20 mRNA in skin lesions were 1.1397±0.0521, which were greatly higher than those in normal controls (0.8681±0.0308) (P<0.001). The expression levels of CCR6 mR-NA in skin lesions were 1.1103±0.0538, significantly higher than in the controls (0.9131±0.0433, P<0.001). These findings indicate that up-regulated expression of CCL20 and CCR6 mRNA might be related to the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

33646091103	Endogenous production of nitric oxide contributes to proliferation effect of vascular endothelial growth factor-induced malignant melanoma cell	The objectives of this study were to observe the effect of overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on the proliferation of the malignant melanoma (MM) cell line A375, and to study the role of nitric oxide (NO) in this process and the mechanism of VEGF induced-A375 cell proliferation. The VEGF165 cDNA was transfected into A375 cells by electroporation. VEGF mRNA and protein in A375 cells were detected by RT-PCR and ELISA. The proliferation of A375 cells was assessed by cell counting and MTT assay. Protein expression of iNOS, eNOS and nNOS was detected by Western blotting. NO production in A375 cell supernatant was measured by the nitrate reductase method. VEGF mRNA in A375 cells was significantly increased 72 h and 96 h after transfection of VEGF165 cDNA, as were VEGF protein, NO and iNOS levels. However, protein expression of eNOS and nNOS was not detected in either transfected or untransfected cells. Proliferation of A375 cells transfected with VEGF165 cDNA was enhanced. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME could dosedependently inhibit the proliferation of A375 cells evoked by VEGF. These results indicate that VEGF enhances the expression of iNOS in A375 cells and results in an increase in NO formation, which may be important in the process of VEGF-induced proliferation of A375 cells. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

34547264219	A retrospective and comparative study of familial and non-familial bullous lichen planus	In order to compare the clinical characteristics of familial and non-familial bullous lichen planus (BLP), the archival data of 36 BLP patients with positive family history and 21 BLP patients with negative family history diagnosed according to the clinical features and histopathology were collected in our department from 1956 to 2003. The clinical features were analyzed and compared. There were significant differences between familial and non-familial BLP in age of onset, duration of disease and extension of eruption (P<0.01). It was concluded that familial BLP appeared to differ from the non-familial form in its earlier age of onset, longer duration of the disease, more extensive eruption and more tendency to involve nails. Hereditary factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of familial BLP. © 2007 Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

34548483896	Expression of neutral endopeptidase and motility-related protein-1 in cutaneous malignant melanoma	Objective: To study the expression of neutral endopeptidase (CD10) and motility-related protein-1 (CD9) in malignant melanoma and their clinical significance. Methods: Immunohistochemical study for CD10 and CD9 using Streptavidin-biotin complex technique was carried out in 48 cases of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM), 23 cases of metastatic melanoma and 23 cases of benign nevus. Results: The positivity rate of CD10 was highest in metastatic melanoma and lowest in benign nevus (P < 0.01). In contrast, the positivity rate of CD9 in metastatic melanoma was lower than that in CMM (P < 0.05). The expression of CD9 was inversely correlated with that of CD10 in malignant melanoma (CMM:r = -0.40, P = 0. 005; metastatic MM:r = -0. 44, P = 0.034). The expression of CD10 and CD9 in CMM also correlated with tumor histology, Clark's level of invasion and presence of nodal metastasis. A similar relationship was also observed for CD10 and CD9 expression in stromal fibroblasts of CMM (r = -0.43, P = 0.007). Conclusions: CD10 and CD9 expression correlates with the invasiveness and metastatic potential of malignant melanoma; both factors may demonstrate a counteracting effect. These two markers have potential implications in prognostic assessment of CMM. Stromal fibroblasts may also play an important role in the progression of CMM.

Mice were divided at random into different groups and then treated with itraconazole or IFN-γ given by gastrogavage. The burden of the fungus in the vaginal lavage fluids in the mice of the different groups was measured dynamically at different time points after the beginning of the drug treatment. The difference in the effect of itraconazole on the vaginal candidiasis between normal immune system group (group A) and control group (group D) was statistically significant (P<0.01). The difference in the efficacy of itraconazole among immunosuppressed group (group E), immuno-regulated group (group F) and the control group (group G) was statistically significant (P<0.01). But on the 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, 11th day after the inoculation the average level of colony forming unit (CFU) of groups A, E and F showed no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). It is concluded that the efficacy of itraconazole in the treatment of the vaginal candidiasis under different immunity conditions (groups A, E and F) in mice were all good, but there was no difference in the anti-fungal effect of itraconazole among the three groups. © 2008 Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Our results showed that the expression of p63 in skin squamous cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease and actinic keratosis were significantly higher than that in seborreic keratosis, while the expression of p63 in seborreic keratosis was significantly higher than that in normal skin. The expression of cox-2 in skin squamous cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease and actinic keratosis were significantly higher than that in seborreic keratosis, while no statistical difference was noted in the expression of cox-2 between seborreic keratosis and normal skin. Cox-2 expression was positively correlated with the high p63 expression in malignant skin tumors. The increased expression of cox-2 and p63 may play an important role in the development of skin tumors and work synergetically in malignant skin tumors. © Huazhong University of Science and Technology 2007.

34248590013	Comparison of the effects of three different anti-fungus drugs on Candida albicans of murine vaginal mucosa	To compare the therapeutic effects of three different anti-fungal drugs (i.e., terbinafine, fluconazole and intraconazole) in the treatment of experimental vaginitis caused by Candida albicans (C. albicans) in mice, the fungal vaginitis model was established in female ICR mice by intravaginal inoculation of suspension of C. albicans after the animal had been pretreated with estradiol. Mice were divided at random into different groups and then respectively treated with terbinafine, fluconazole and intraconazole given by gastrogavage. The burden of the fungus in the vaginal lavage fluids in the mice of the different groups was measured dynamically at different time points after the beginning of the drug treatment. The fungal burdens in the vaginal lavage fluids taken at different time points from the mice treated with terbinafine were significantly higher than those taken at corresponding time points from mice treated with fluconazole or itraconazole (P<0.01). The fungal burdens in the vaginal lavage fluids taken from mice 1 week after the beginning of the treatment with terbinafine remained at a relatively high level. A dramatic drop in the fungal burden was noted in the vaginal lavage fluids taken on the 2nd day of the treatment from mice treated with itraconazole or fluconazole group and the fungal burden on the 3rd day of the treatment in these mice were at a very low level, suggesting that fluconazole or itraconazole were highly effective for the treatment. However, the difference in the therapeutic effect between the two drugs was not significant (P>0.05). Itraconazole or fluconazole, but not terbinafine, is very effective for the treatment of fungal vaginitis caused by C. albicans in mice. © Huazhong University of Science and Technology 2007.

In these models, two-site ELISA and RT-PCR were applied to determine the level of IL-4 protein and mRNA expression in spleens respectively, clone forming units (CFUs) of infected kidneys were determined with the plating dilution method, and mean survival time (MST) of the mice was recorded. The results showed that, when compared with the controls, protein level of IL-4 increased in both intact mice infected with lethal doses of yeast (day 3, P<0.05; day 7, P<0.001) and immunosuppressed mice infected with sublethal doses of yeast (day 3, P>0.05; day 7, P<0.05). Furthermore, the level of IL-4 was higher on day 7 than on day 3 after infection (P<0.001 and P<0.05 respectively in two groups). The tendency of IL-4mRNA expression was similar with that of IL-4 protein. As for fungal loads in kid neys, CFUs were significantly higher on day 7 than on day 3 after infection (P<0.001 in both groups). Mice in both groups succumbed to infection within several days. It was suggested that IL-4 might play a promoting role in the development of murine systemic Candidiasis.

0034865538	A study on the expression of interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12 P35, P40 mRNA in the psoriatic lesions	To investigate the possible role of interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12 in the pathogenesis of psoriatic lesions and to supply theoretical basis for the gene therapy for psoriasis, the expression of IL-10 and IL-12 P35, P40 mRNA in 12 cases of psoriatic lesions and 6 normal skin tissues was detected by using RT-PCR technique. The results showed that the expression of IL-10 mRNA in the psoriatic lesions was significantly lower than that in the normal skin tissues (P<0.001). The expression of IL-12 P35 was positive both in the psoriatic lesions and in the normal skin tissues. IL-12 P40 mRNA was expressed positively only in the psoriatic lesions but negatively in the normal skin tissues. It was suggested that IL-12 might take an important role in the occurrence and progression of psoriasis, but IL-10 might have certain role in the regression of psoriasis.

0034873485	The expression of Fas/FasL in peripheral blood lymphocytes and the level of IL-2 in serum of patients with condyloma acuminata	In order to investigate the role of the expression Fas/FasL in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLC) and the level of IL-2 in serum of patients with condyloma acuminata (CA) in the immune pathogenesis of CA, flow cytometry, indirect immunofluorescence labeling and ELISA were performed to detect the expression of the apoptotic regulatory proteins Fas/FasL in PBLC and the level of IL-2 in serum of 60 patients with different course of CA. The results showed that the expression of Fas/FasL in PBLC of the group of short course in CA was significantly higher than that of the normal controls (P<0.05); the expression of Fas, FasL in PBLC of the group of long course CA was significantly higher than that of the group of short course and the normal controls (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively); the level of IL-2 in serum of the group of short and long course CA was significantly lower than that of the group of normal controls (P<0.01); the negative relation was revealed between the expression of Fas/FasL in PBLC and the level of IL-2 in serum of patients with CA (r=-0.76, P<0.01). It was suggested that the abnormal apoptosis in PBLC and decreased level of IL-2 in serum of CA might play an important role in the course of CA.

42449132946	Olmsted syndrome: A case report and review of literature	We report a case of an 18-month-old boy with slightly whitened fingernails and toenails since birth. At the age of 100 days, he progressively developed bilateral palmoplantar keratoderma which resulted in painful walking and disabled grasping. Perianal keratotic plaques and perioral hyperkeratotic erythema could also be observed. Both fingernails and toenails were dystrophic. Scalp hairs were sparse, but total alopecia was no present. The histopathologic changes of the biopsy from the inner side of the right foot showed nonspecific changes, which mainly showed highly hyperkeratosis and acanthosis with slight superficial perivascular inflammatory infiltration. A clinical diagnosis of Olmsted syndrome was established according to the typical feature of the lesions, which is the presence of symmetrical palmoplantar keratoderma with periorificial keratotic plaques. We review the literature and present a summary of all reported cases to date. © 2008 The International Society of Dermatology.

43749115512	Up-regulation of human leukocyte antigen G expression in primary cutaneous malignant melanoma associated with host-vs-tumor immune response	Human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) is one of the molecules implicated in immunotolerance. To investigate the role of HLA-G in primary cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM), a series of 47 skin melanocytic lesions were immunohistochemically evaluated. The correlation between HLA-G expression and CMM clinicohistopathological data and Bcl-2 expression was also analyzed. HLA-G expression was detected in a variety of cell types. No significant difference in HLA-G expression was observed between malignant and non-malignant melanocytic lesions. HLA-G expression was significantly correlated with the inflammatory infiltration and Bcl-2 expression, whereas no significant correlation with ulceration, tumor thickness, clinical stage, histopathological subtypes were observed. HLA-G expression may be the result of host immune reaction in tumor microenvironment rather than a malignant feature of CMM. © 2008 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

43749121575	Selective expression of progesterone receptor in malignant melanoma was inversely correlated with PCNA	To investigate the role of progesterone receptor (PR) expression in malignant melanoma (MM), PR and proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression were immunohistochemistrically evaluated in a series of 35 specimens of MM, and the correlation between the immunohistochemistrical findings and clinicopathological data was also analyzed. PR expression was detected in 25.7% (9/35) of the patients with MM. No PR expression was observed in nevi. PR expression was inversely correlated with PCNA expression (r=-0.353, P=0.026). PR expression was slightly increased in females, subjects aged under 55 y, those with ulceration, non-acral subtype and diagnosis delay longer than 1 y, but the difference was not statistically significant. Selective expression of progesterone receptor in malignant melanoma might be correlated with inhibited tumor growth. © 2008 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

45749122742	Local Th1/Th2 cytokine expression in experimental murine vaginal candidiasis	In order to investigate the expression of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in the vaginal candidiasis caused by Candida, the fungal vaginitis model was established in female ICR mice by intravaginal inoculation of suspension of C. albicans after the animals were pretreated with estradiol. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β1 in the vagina in the mice of different groups at different time points after the beginning of the experiment. The average expression level of IL-2 mRNA in group D (estrogen-treated mice) was significantly higher than that in groups H (estrogen-untreated mice) and I (control group) on the day 2. The average expression level of IL-4 mRNA in group D was significantly higher than that in groups I and H on the day 5. The average expression level of IL-10 mRNA in group D was significantly higher than that in groups H and I from day 7 to 11. The average expression level of TGF-β1 mRNA in group D was significantly higher than that in groups H and I at all time points. It was concludes that the high-level expression of IL-2 mRNA during early infection was associated with clearance of mucosal C. albicans, and the high-level expression of IL-10 mRNA during late stage of the infection was related to susceptibility to infection. TGF-β1 may play a predominant role when the virtual absence of changes in other Th-type cytokines during infection. © 2008 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

45749136819	Inhibition of invasion and up-regulation of E-cadherin expression in human malignant melanoma cell line A375 by (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate	The inhibitory effects of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the invasion of human malignant melanoma cell line A375 and the possible molecular mechanisms of this effect were investiaged. A375 cells were pretreated with 20 μg/mL EGCG for 24, 48 and 72 h respectively and the E-cadherin expression was detected by Western blot analysis. A375 cells were also pretreated with different concentrations of EGCG (1, 5, 10 and 20 μg/mL) for 72 h and the expression of E-cadherin was measured by RT-PCR. The adhesion and invasion of A375 cells were tested by cell-matrigel adhesion assay and matrigel invasion assay respectively. The results showed that EGCG could significantly up-regulate the expression of E-cadherin time-and concentration-dependently (both P<0.05). Statistical analysis showed that A375 cells invasion was inhibited by EGCG and correlated with the up-regulation of E-cadherin expression. It was suggested that EGCG strongly inhibited invasion of A375 cells, and the inhibition mechanism was possibly associated with the up-regulation of E-cadherin expression. © 2008 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

49749114271	Local expression of vaginal Th1 and Th2 cytokines in murine vaginal candidiasis under different immunity conditions	To investigate the expression of vaginal Th1 and Th2 cytokines in rats with experimental vaginal candidiasis under different immune conditions, ICR murine vaginal candidiasis model was established and immno-suppressed murine models of vaginal cadidiasis were established in estrogen-treated mice. Non-estrogen-treated mice were used as controls. The mRNA level of Th1 (IL-2)/Th2 (IL-4, IL-10, TGF-β1) cytokines in murine vaginal tissues was determined by RT-PCR. The cykotine in local tissues was increased to different extent under normal immune condition. IL-2 mRNA was increased during early stage of infection, while IL-10 was increased transiently during late stage of infection. TGF-β1 production was found to be increased persistently. At same time, the expression of IL-2 mRNA was suppressed in immno-suppressed group, and the level of IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β1 were higher than the normal immunity group to different degree during infection. The high level of IL-2 mRNA during early stage of infection was associated with clearance of mucosal Candidia albicans (C. albicans), and its expression suppressed leading to decreased clearance of mucosal C. albican in immuno-suppression. The over-expression of IL-4 and IL-10 could significantly enhance the susceptibility to C. albicans infection in mice. © 2008 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

The results showed that the expression of MMP-9 in lesions of diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis was significantly lower than that of normal skins (P<0.05). However, no significant difference in the level of MMP-9 in the limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis and normal skin was found. Meanwhile, the expression of TIMP-1 in lesions of diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis and limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis were significantly higher than that of normal skins (both P<0.05).

Twenty-four strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae fell into 10 ST genotypes by NG-MAST genotyping, whereas these strains were classified into 12 OT Opa genotypes by Opa genotyping. A new epidemic strain of ST genotype (217-86% homologisation 178) in China was identified. It is concluded that genotypes of each pair of strains from a pair of patient/ sex partner besides 45/46 are the same, indicating that contagious infection take place between patient and the sex partner. Opa genotyping was more effective than NG-MAST genotyping in identifying the genomic species of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. ST genotype could be further classified into different Opa-types. © 2008 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

A 39-year-old male peasant presented with nodules on malar area after trauma for 2 years, the patient received therapies including surgical operation, many kinds of antibiotics, anti-tuberculosis agents, prednisone and cyclophosphamide, but failed. The condition became more and more severe gradually, the number and size of infiltrated plaques and nodules increased, and spread to the right eyelid, face, nose and paranasal sinuses, and was painful and feverish. Histopathologic examination of biopsy tissues from the left lower eyelid lesion exhibited inflammatory granuloma. There were a great number of fine hyphae and arthrospores in the biopsy tissues of ulcer of left face and left maxillary sinus obtained by centesis. The pathogenic fungus was identified as Candida lipolytica by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA using fungal genomic DNA extracted from the tissue of the maxillary sinus.It is the author's opinion that in diagnosing a disease which involves brownish-purple infiltrated plaques or nodules in the site where a trauma occurs, to which no effect yields with treatments of surgical operation, antibiotics, anti-tuberculosis agents, immunosuppressive drugs and corticosteroids, and accompanied by fever, deep mycosis should be taken into account, and necessary laboratory examinations including histopathology of biopsy tissues, fungus culture and genetic identification of pathogenic agent should he performed, in the meantime, effective antifungal therapy should be given.

77953091354	Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum	A case of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum was reported. A 76-year-old male patient presented with a neoplasm on the hypogastric region for more than 30 years. Recently the lesion became red, swelling and ulcerated for one month. Physical examination showed there was a 2 cm x 2 cm sized dome-shaped bright red firm tumor on the hypogastrium. The lesional surface showed a moist feature and was covered by hemorrhagic and mucoid exudations. The surrounding skin of the lesion was red and edematous. Histopathologic examination revealed that the tumor showed deep invaginations containing numerous papillary projections. These invaginations and papillary projections were lined by two-layered epithelium. The luminal layer was composed of columnar cells with oval nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, whereas the outer layer small cuboidal cells with oval nuclei and scanty cytoplasm. A large number of interstitial plasma cell infiltrations could be found. Irregular arrangement of the epithelial cells was present in the lower parts of these invaginations. In the deeper portion of the tumor, numerous irregular neoplastic tubular and cystic structures diffusely infiltrated the entire dermis in an invasive growth pattern. These neoplastic tubular and cystic structures were lined by monolayered or multilayered atypical cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei. Cytologic atypia and mitotic figures were present. The tumor was positive for pan-CK, EMA and part GCDFP-15, but negative for CEA and S-100. The case was finally diagnosed as syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum.

77956246507	Plumbagin enhances TRAIL-mediated apoptosis through up-regulation of death receptor in human melanoma A375 cells	Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising anti-cancer agent. However, emergence of drug resistance limits its potential use. Plumbagin is a natural quinonoid compound isolated from plant. In this study, induced apoptosis effect of the combined treatment with plumbagin and TRAIL on human melanoma A375 cell line was examined and possible mechanism was investigated. The cells were divided into four groups: control group, plumbagin group (plumbagin, 5 or 10 μmol/L), TRAIL group (TRAIL, 30 ng/mL) and plumbagin+TRAIL group (combined treatment group). The apoptosis, and the expression of DR4 and DR5 were detected by flow cytometry. The activities of caspase-8 and caspase-3 were determined by colorimetric assay. The results showed that the apoptosis rate was 8.3% in TRAIL group, 10.35%-16.94% in plumbagin group and 52.39%-65.39% in combined treatment group, respectively, with the difference being significant between combined treatment group and plumbagin or TRAIL group (P<0.05 for each). Moreover, plumbagin alone could markedly up-regulate DR5 mRNA and protein expression, and slightly increase DR4 mRNA and protein expression. Treatment of human melanoma A375 cells with plumbagin resulted in the activation of Caspase-3, but not Caspase-8. These results suggest that plumbagin might be useful for TRAIL-based treatment for melanoma. © 2010 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77956055782	Childhood psoriasis: A study of 137 cases from central China	Background: Childhood psoriasis is common, but it has not been adequately reported in China. This study was undertaken to evaluate the epidemiological and clinical findings in children with psoriasis treated in a 9-year period and to compare the data with those from other studies. Methods: The data were from 137 children (≤14 years old) with psoriasis registered in two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China between January 2000 and December 2008. They were retrospectively studied. Results: Of the 137 patients, aged between 3 and 14 years, 64 were males (46.7%) and 73 females (53.3%). Eleven patients (8%) had a family history of psoriasis. Infection was the most common precipitating factor (39, 28.5%). Seasonal influence was found in 57 patients (41.6%). Exacerbations in winter and spring were noted in 29 and 16 patients respectively. Plaque psoriasis was the most common type (72 patients, 52.6%), followed by guttate psoriasis (35, 25.5%), psoriasis pustulosa (15, 10.9%), and psoriasis erythroderma (7, 5.1%). The scalp was the most common initial site affected (69, 50.3%). Nail changes were found in 35 patients (25.5%), but no mucosal involvements were observed. Five patients had arthralgia and two showed abnormal X-ray appearance. Most of the affected children had pruritus. The co-morbidities of childhood psoriasis included allergic contact dermatitis (31, 22.6%), eczema (6, 4.3%), vitiligo (5, 3.6%), and alopecia areata (3, 2.2%). Psoriasis was sometimes misdiagnosed as dermatitis seborrheica (11, 8.0%), neurodermatitis (9, 6.6%) and balanitis (7, 5.1%). Some patients were treated with steroids, but there were obvious side-effects after longterm administration. Thiamphenicol was effective in the treatment of refractory psoriasis pustulosa in children. Conclusions: Our findings differ from those of previous studies, showing a lower rate of family history and a higher incidence of severe psoriasis. Differential diagnosis should be made especially when lesions occur at the scalp, elbow or balanus. Allergic contact dermatitis takes place more frequently in children with psoriasis than in normal children. Systemic corticosteroids should not be routinely used and other safer and more effective treatments are needed for severe cases. © 2010 Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79955370589	Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 inhibits transforming growth factor-β1-induced collagen type I expression in keloid	Background: Keloids are benign skin tumours occurring during wound healing in genetically predisposed patients. There is evidence that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is involved in keloid formation. Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 (Cthrc1) was identified as a novel gene expressed in the adventitia and neointima on arterial injury. It is indicated to be a cell type-specific inhibitor of TGF-β, which functionally increases cell migration while reducing collagen type I and III deposition. However, to our knowledge expression and regulatory mechanisms of Cthrc1 and TGF-β1 in keloid and normal skin have not been studied before. Objectives: Cthrc1 gene regulation and potential role in keloid formation were determined, and its correlation with TGF-β1 involved in keloid pathogenesis was examined in human fibroblasts of keloids and normal skin. Methods: The expression of Cthrc1 and TGF-β1 was investigated in fibroblasts of keloid and normal skin. Collagen type I expression and collagen synthesis in keloid fibroblasts induced by TGF-β1 were examined. Then, recombinant Cthrc1 was applied to assess its correlation with TGF-β1. Results: Increased TGF-β1 and Cthrc1 expression was examined in keloid compared with normal skin. Cthrc1 expression increased in a concentration-dependent manner induced by TGF-β1 in keloid fibroblasts. TGF-β1 stimulated collagen type I expression and collagen synthesis in keloid fibroblasts, which can be reversed by recombinant Cthrc1. Conclusions: TGF-β1 was upregulated in keloid fibroblasts and recombinant Cthrc1 inhibited TGF-β1-stimulated collagen type I synthesis, which suggests that Cthrc1 may be a potential therapeutic option for keloids. © 2011 British Association of Dermatologists.

80455155233	Inhibition of melanoma cell proliferation by targeting Wnt/β-catenin pathway through Sox4 RNA interference	The effect of siRNA-mediated Sox4 gene silencing on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway of human malignant melanoma cell line A375 was investigated. Two types of dsRNA targeting Sox4 were constructed and transfected into A375 cells, and untreated cells and cells transfected with scramble RNA were used as blank control and negative control respectively. The expression levels of mRNA and protein of Sox4, Wnt3a, β-catenin and Wnt/β-catenin signaling target gene Survivin were detected after real-time PCR and Western blot respectively. MTT assay was used to measure cell proliferation after Sox4 knockdown. β-catenin/TCF transcription reporter assay was used for assessing Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway activity. Our results showed that the two types of Sox4 siRNA were transfected into A375 cells successfully. As compared with untreated cells, Sox4 siRNAs had no significant influence on Wnt3a expression, and Sox4 siRNAs led to the decrease of β-catenin at protein level. Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway activity was inhibited significantly. As a target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, Survivin was decreased at both mRNA and protein levels, and cell proliferation was attenuated. Our study suggests that Sox4 may play an important role in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in human malignant melanoma cells by regulating β-catenin protein level, indicating that Sox4 is involved in the progression of malignant melanoma through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. © Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

To our knowledge, immunostaining of IGFBP7 in various dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and dermatofibroma (DF) has not been studied before. Objectives To assess the immunostaining of IGFBP7 in DFSPs and DFs and to ascertain whether IGFBP7 is superior to antibodies traditionally used in differentiating DFs from DFSPs. Methods Immunohistochemical staining was performed on 28 cases of DFSP and 30 cases of DF, using antibodies to IGFBP7, CD34, factor XIIIa (FXIIIa), CD10 and stromelysin-3 (ST-3). Results Six of 28 (21.4%) DFSP samples were positive for IGFBP7, whereas 28 of 30 (93.3%) DF samples were positive. CD34 was positive in 26 of 28 (92.9%) cases of DFSP and 4 of 30 (13.3%) cases of DF. FXIIIa staining was positive in 4 of 28 (14.3%) cases of DFSP and 28 of 30 (93.3%) cases of DF. CD10 staining was positive in 12 of 28 (42.9%) cases of DFSP and ST-3 staining was positive in 7 of 28 (25.0%) cases of DFSP. The preferential IGFP7 staining of DFSPs in comparison with DFs was statistically significant (P < 0.01). Conclusions We confirmed that IGFBP7 is a negative immunohistochemical marker for DFSPs and the combination with CD34, FXIIIa and ST-3 immunostaining could make the distinction more reliable. © 2011 The Authors.

84881285699	IL-36 cytokine expression and its relationship with p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways in psoriasis vulgaris skin lesions	This study examined the correlation of the expression of interleukin-36 (IL-36), a novel member of interleukin-1 (IL-1) family, with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways in psoriasis vulgaris skin lesions. The expression levels of IL-36α, IL-36β, IL-36Γ, phosphorylated p38 MAPK, and NF-κBp65 were detected in the skin tissues of 38 psoriasis patients and 17 healthy control subjects by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. The cytokine expression levels were compared between the psoriasis group and the control group. A correlation analysis between cytokine proteins was performed in the psoriasis group. Results showed that the expression levels of IL-36a, IL-36β, IL-36Γ, phosphorylated p38 MAPK and NF-κBp65 in the psoriasis group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.001). In the psoriasis group, the IL-36 cytokine expression was positively correlated with phosphorylated p38 MAPK and NF-κBp65 expression (P<0.05). A significant positive correlation was also found between the phosphorylated p38 MAPK and NF-κBp65 expression (P<0.01). It was concluded that the increased IL-36 expression is correlated with p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways in psoriasis vulgaris skin lesions. All the three factors may be jointly involved in the pathogenesis and local inflammatory response of psoriasis. © 2013 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84903985117	Expression of USP15, TβR-I and Smad7 in psoriasis	The deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin specific peptidase 15 (USP15) is regarded as a regulator of TGFβ signaling pathway. This process depends on Smad7, the inhibitory factor of the TGFβ signal, and type I TGFβ receptor (TβR-I), one of the receptors of TGFβ. The expression level of USP15 seems to play vital roles in the pathogenesis of many neoplasms, but so far there has been no report about USP15 in psoriasis. In this study, immunohistochemical staining of USP15, TβR-I and Smad7 was performed in 30 paraffin-embedded psoriasis specimens and 10 normal specimens to investigate the expression of USP15, TβR-I and Smad7 in psoriasis and to explore the relevance among them. And USP15 small interfering RNA (USP15 siRNA) was used to transfect Hacat cells to detect the mRNA expression of TβR-I and Smad7. Of 30 cases of psoriasis in active stage, 28, 24 and 26 cases were positive for USP15, TβR-I and Smad7 staining, respectively. The positive rates of USP15 and Smad7 were significantly higher in psoriasis specimens than in normal skin specimens (44.1%±26.0% vs. 6.1%±6.6%, 47.2%±27.1% vs. 6.6%±7.1%), and positive rate of TβR-I (20.3%±22.2%) in psoriasis was lower than that in normal skin specimens (46.7%±18.2%). There was a significant positive correlation between USP15 and Smad7 expression, and significant negative correlations between USP15 and TβR-expression, an I d between TβR- and Smad7 expression I in psoriasis. After transfection of USP15 siRNA in Hacat cells, the expression of TβR-mRNA was up I -regulated and that of Smad7 was down-regulated. It is concluded that USP15 may play a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis through regulating the TβR-I/Smad7 pathway and there may be other cell signaling pathways interacting with USP15 to take part in the development of psoriasis. © 2014 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84906237983	Analysis of Th1/Th2 response pattern for erythrodermic psoriasis	As one of the most serious types of psoriasis, pathogenesis of erythrodermic psoriasis (EP) is unclear so far. In this study, we aimed to detect the levels of Th1/Th2 cytokine-associated transcription factors and T-lymphocyte clone in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from EP patients, and gene expression level of T-bet/GATA-3 in skin lesion. The potential role of Th1/Th2 reaction pattern played in the pathogenesis of EP was also discussed. Serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 were quantified by ELISA among 16 EP patients, 20 psoriasis vulgaris (PV) patients and 15 healthy controls. The expression levels of T-bet/GATA-3 in the skin lesion and PBMCs were examined by real-time qPCR. The ratio of Th1/Th2 was measured by flow cytometry. The levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 were higher in EP patients than in the healthy controls. The levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were 69.44±11.45 and 12.62±4.57 pg/mL, respectively, in EP patients, significantly higher than those in PV patients and healthy controls (P<0.05). Flow cytometry revealed the levels of both Th1 and Th2 in PBMCs from EP patients were higher than those in healthy controls, and the Th1/Th2 ratio was dramatically lower than in PV patients (P<0.01). The ratios of IFN-γ/IL-4 and T-bet/GATA-3 in EP patients were both less than 1.0, suggesting a reversal when compared with the other two groups. Our study indicated that the EP patients exerted a Th1/Th2 bidirectional response pattern, and the balance of Th cell subsets inclines to Th2, which might be one of the important mechanisms of EP pathogenesis. © 2014 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
