Up to now, there are three versions, mentioned as reversion 0, A and B. A great number of techniques, such as hybrid-ARQ, adaptive modulation and coding, as well as multi-user diversity, support the system to have higher spectral efficiency and better performance. In this paper, technical background and some salient features of EV-DO are summarized. In order to evaluate the DO network performance, the system level simulation is considered based on appropriate assumptions and parameters. Four hot advanced techniques, the distributed token bucket rate control mechanism, reverse link interference cancellation, forward link equalizer and multi-carrier, are deployed and judged in the existing EV-DO system.

84866696083	Multiplicative multi-attribute auction based optimal network selection for heterogeneous wireless networks	One of the remarkable features of the next generation network is the integration of heterogeneous wireless networks, which enables mobile users with multi-mode terminals access to the best available network seamlessly. However, most of previous work only takes account of either maximizing single user's utility or the whole network's payoff, rarely considers the negotiation between them. In this paper, we propose a novel network selection approach using improved multiplicative multi-attribute auction (MMA). At first, an improved MMA method is put forward to define the user's utility. Additionally, user cost is defined by considering allocated bandwidth, network load intensity and cost factor parameter. And last the best suitable network is selected according to the user's performance-cost-ration. Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing scheme in terms of network selection's fairness, user's performance-cost-ration, load balancing and the number of accommodated users. © 2012 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.

58349117467	A novel statistic-based relaxed grid resource reservation strategy	In Grid environments, advance reservation mechanism is to provide reliable resource co-allocation and scheduling for applications. However, excessive advance reservation will bring about many negative effects for system's performance, such as lower resource utilization and higher rejection rate. To mitigate these negative effects of advance reservation, a relaxed reservation strategy is proposed, in which the reservation admission criteria is more relaxing than that of conventional reservation. The strategy is based on the facts that grid applications tend to overestimate reservation duration to ensure their completion. In the proposed relaxed reservation strategy, reservation manager might accept those reservations that are overlapping with existing ones. Experimental results show that the strategy can bring about remarkably higher resource utilization and lower rejection rate at the price of a slightly increasing of reservation violations. © 2008 IEEE.

60649087016	Discovering the driving factors of landslides of the Wenchuan earthquake using remote sensing and GIS	On May 12 in 2008, a Magnitude 8.0 earthquake hit Wenchuan in China, and the casualty shocked the whole world. The landslide was a frequent secondary disaster in this earthquake, so to analyze the mechanism of landslides in the disaster area is very important for post-earthquake reconstruction. The study area is located in PingWu County, which was also hit by the earthquake severely. And the data sources are ETM+ image, DEM and interpreted ALOS image. This paper considered four potential driving factors for landslides, and they are land cover, lineament, slope and drainage. The land cover was classified based on the density of vegetation, and sub-pixel analysis was employed; Density of lineament was calculated by Sobel operator and image segmentation; Slope was classified by using a threshold; Drainage was considered without numerical analysis, because it is significant and simple in study area. To find out how they influenced the landslides, conditional probability was utilized as a measurement. The result shows that areas in sparse vegetation, dense lineament and steep topography were easy to meet landslides, while drainages also induced landslides. © 2008 SPIE.

70349169023	A novel team-centric peer selection scheme for distributed wireless P2P networks	Selecting an appropriate peer from the discovered file holders is one of the key steps in wireless peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems. Most of existing peer selection schemes are based on the min-hops selection criterion, which uses the number of hops as the only factor in peer selection. However, due to the distinct characteristics in wireless mobile networks, a number of important factors should be considered in wireless P2P networks, such as time-varying channels, node energy, security and user movement. In this paper, we propose a novel peer selection scheme that simultaneously considers multiple selection criteria in wireless P2P networks. The proposed scheme is based on recent advances in fuzzy cognitive maps theory. The main influential factors and their complex relationships for peer selection in wireless P2P networks are investigated. The candidate peer and corresponding intermediate peers along the path are treated as a team for evaluation. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2009 IEEE.

Compared with the traditional min-hops criterion, the new approach introduces a fuzzy knowledge combination theory to investigate several important factors that influence files transfer success rate and efficiency. Whereas the min-hops based protocols only ask the nearest candidate peer for desired files, the selection algorithm based on AOC comprehensively considers users' preferences and network requirements with flexible balancing rules. Furthermore, its advantage also expresses in the independence of specified resource discovering protocols, allowing for scalability. The simulation results show that when using the AOC based peer selection algorithm, system performance is much better than the min-hops scheme, with files successful transfer rate improved more than 50% and transfer time reduced at least 20%.

Considering the uncertainty of endmembers' spectra, based on Bayesian inference and linear spectral mixture model, the posterior probability of per-pixel endmembers set was obtained. Using the prior knowledge of endmembers' coexistence, combined with the normal distribution function of endmembers' spectra, the optimal endmembers set was selected based on maximal liklihood. The experiment on an ETM+ image including 147431 pixel showed that, compared with the MRES and PG algorithms provided by IDRISI, the Bayesian approach reduced 70% redundant endmembers, and the unmixing error induced by inaccurate endmembers was reduced to 28%. The result showed that, considering the uncertainty of endmemebers' spectra and the coexistence of endmembers, Bayesian inference can increase the accuracy rate of endmembers' selection, so the unmixing accuracy was improved significantly.

70449502117	A FCM-based peer grouping scheme for node failure recovery in wireless P2P file sharing	An effective node failure recovery scheme is very important in wireless peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing networks. Most of the existing failure recovery protocols are based on backup path mechanism, in which a new path will be used if the original one breaks. However, due to the limited resources in wireless environments, the maintenance of backup paths is expensive. Moreover, the time spending on path switch may be unacceptable long. In this paper, we propose a novel peer grouping scheme to select a qualified peer from a group to replace the failed node. The main criteria in deciding the backup node is derived with the help of recent advances in fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM). Several influential factors are considered, including energy, movement, lingering time and security, with further investigation on their respective contributions to node failure risk. We compare the performance of the proposed scheme with that of traditional path redirection and multi-path backup algorithms. The FCM-based peer grouping scheme has significant improvement in failure recovery time and file transfer time. ©2009 IEEE.

The testes of 13 free-ranging male YFPs from the Tian-e-Zhou Reserve and three captive animals from the Baiji Dolphinarium (Wuhan, China) were examined ultrasonographically during April 2008. Testis volume was determined using Lambert's formula for an ellipsoid. Testicular parenchyma PI was evaluated by analyzing testicular ultrasonograms using pixel analysis software (Image J). Serum T concentrations were determined using a single-antibody radioimmunoassay. The TV, PI, and serum T concentration were low and similar in animals with body length <133 cm, highest in those with body length ≥142 cm, and highly variable in those with body length from 133 to 141 cm. Both TV and PI were closely correlated with serum T concentration (r = 0.91 and r = 0.85, respectively; P < 0.01), indicating a consistent association between structural and functional development of the testis. In conclusion, we inferred that puberty onset in male YFPs occurred when TV was >150 cm

To resolve this problem, we propose a novel speed sensitive vertical handoff algorithm based on fuzzy control. Based on collected information on RSS, load conditions of candidate networks, velocity of mobile terminals and user preference, the vertical handover decision is made by fuzzy logic process. It improves the handoff efficiency when users are moving at a high speed.

In this paper, we propose a novel user-adaptive vertical handover scheme based on MIH in UMTS, Wi-Fi and WiMAX networks. It follows user-adaptive principles in which a user's QoS demand is taken into consideration in both handover initiation and decision making procedures. We define two kinds of handover triggers caused by unfulfilled QoS requirements or deteriorating wireless channel conditions. Compared with classical Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) methods, a more flexible selection criterion to choose the network providing proper QoS according to a user's need is designed and discussed.

77952862184	Virtual bidder group auction mechanism for dynamic spectrum access	In order to fully utilize spectrum, auction-based dynamic spectrum access has become a promising approach which allows unlicensed wireless users to lease unused bands from spectrum license holders. Traditionally, the property of spectrum goes to a unique winner with the highest bid after the auction, and the bidders with low bids would be probably not served. This also may result in spectrum resource wasting when the assigned band is larger than the original request. In fact, because the spectrum is divisible goods, it can be shared among a group of users. In this paper, we propose a novel virtual bidder group (VBG) mechanism in spectrum auction which allows multiple winners to obtain the spectrum item simultaneously. Furthermore, a heuristic phase-optimization algorithm is proposed to reduce the crucial exponential computing time issue of band allocation optimization in double-side bandwidth auction scenario with multiple auctioneers. Simulation results prove that the VBG scheme could significantly improve the realized system data rate and the bandwidth utility, which indicates higher revenue for the spectrum license holder; meanwhile, the proposed phase-optimization algorithm exhibits relative low complexity and could provide a near-optimal performance. ©2009 IEEE.

Consequently how to effectively guarantee meeting users' deadline requirements is a challenging problem for workflow scheduling in dynamic grid environment. Stochastic service model is utilized to describe dynamic processing capacity of grid resource and its dynamic workloads. The concept of deadline satisfaction degree (DSD) is defined and a corresponding calculation method for deadline satisfaction degree of workflow (DSDW) is provided. The task precedence relations represented in a DAG are converted into task execution priorities represented in numbers based on task length, and then the candidate resource for each task in the workflow is selected based on the rule of maximizing DSD. The deadline distribution is modeled as a non-linear programming problem with constraints and resolved with an interior point algorithm. A deadline satisfaction enhanced scheduling algorithm for workflow (DSESAW), which includes resource selection and overall deadline distribution, is put forward finally. The extensive simulations using real-world workflow application and grid system are made to validate this algorithm.

However, the mobility of relay terminals requires quick converging optimization strategies to refresh the relay links frequently. Based on the capacity analysis of multiple relay channels, an improved cross-layer optimization scheme is proposed to resolve this problem, in which the bound of the relay selecting region is determined as a pre-processing. Utilizing the primal-dual algorithm, a cross-layer framework with pre-processing optimizes both the relay terminal selection and power allocation with quick convergence. The simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2011 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.

79960022022	Energy-efficient joint relay node selection and power allocation over multihop relaying cellular networks toward LTE-Advanced	Cooperative relaying is emerging as an effective technology to fulfill requirements on high data rate coverage in next-generation cellular networks, like long term evolution-advanced (LTE-Advanced). In this paper, we propose a distributed joint relay node (RN) selection and power allocation scheme over multihop relaying cellular networks toward LTE-Advanced, taking both the wireless channel state and RNs' residual energy into consideration. We formulate the multihop relaying cellular network as a restless bandit system. The first-order finite-state Markov chain is used to characterize the time-varying channel and residual energy state transitions. With this stochastic optimization formulation, the optimal policy has indexability property that dramatically reduces the computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can efficiently enhance the expected system reward, compared with other existing algorithms. © 2011 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.

79960649888	Blind unmixing of hyperspectral mixed pixels assisted by wavelet packet decomposition	A method called "wavelet packet approach to sub-band decomposition independent component analysis" was introduced to unmix hyperspectral mixed pixels. Using wavelet packet decomposition technique to improve independent component analysis, a blind unmixing method for hyperspectral data was proposed considering the characteristics of hyperspectral data, and this method could overcome the drawback derived from statistical independence assumption in independent component analysis. Two groups of synthetic data and three groups of indoor data were used to evaluate this method. The experiments show that spectra and fractional abundances of the endmemebers can be retrieved precisely using the proposed method, and its accuracy is significantly higher than that of independent component analysis. This approach is useful for blind unmixing of hyperspectral remotely sensed imagery.

80053161013	QoS-driven service composition with multiple flow structures	With the increasing number of functionally similar services deployed over the Internet, QoS (Quality of Service) plays a more and more important role on deciding which component services should be selected to satisfy the quality requirements for a composite service. Although there exist some service composition approaches to select component services with regard to global QoS constraints, none of them facilitates handling global constraints for general flow structures in real-time distributed systems. In this paper, based on a hierarchical Colored Petri Nets, an approach named LOSGC (Local Optimal Selection with Global Constraints) is proposed to address this problem efficiently and effectively. The new approach is applicable to real-time distributed systems with general flow structures, including sequential, while, conditional choice and parallel operations. The global constraints are decomposed into local constraints according to flow structures, and then the distributed local selections are utilized to select optimal services that satisfy local constraints. A case study is performed to show that LOSGC can effectively apply to complex systems. Meanwhile, the results of experimental evaluation indicate that LOSGC can achieve close-to-optimal results with a significant improvement in terms of computation time. © 2011 IEEE.

80054692267	Optimal joint relay selection and resource allocation with QoS constraints in multiuser OFDM-based cellular networks	This paper investigates the relay selection and resource allocation problem in multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based cooperative cellular networks, in which user nodes could relay information for each other using the decode-and-forward (DF) protocol to achieve spatial diversity gain. Specifically, the paper proposes an optimal joint relay selection and resource allocation (ORSRA) algorithm whose objective is to maximize system total achievable data rate with the constraints of each user's individual quality of service (QoS) requirement and transmission power. Due to being a mixed binary integer programming (MBIP) problem, a novel two-level Lagrangian dual-primal decomposition and subgradient projection approach is proposed to not only select the appropriate cooperative relay nodes, but also allocate subcarries and power optimally. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can efficiently enhance overall system data rate and guarantee each user's QoS requirement.

The relay-enhanced network provides user equipment (UE) multiple handover choices from neighbor base stations or relays. This may result in different overhead, resource utility and traffic load which attaches importance to proper handover schemes. Compared with traditional handover measurement and decision schemes, the proposed scheme adopts reference signal receiving quality (RSRQ) in the measurement stage and uses a modified signal cost function considering signal overhead in different handover types and expected long-term throughput of UE. Besides, UE fairness and sector resource utilization are taken into account as well. Theory analysis and simulation results prove that the proposed scheme can enhance cell throughput, decrease handover delay and signal overhead, and improve UE fairness.

82555168458	An optimized spectral difference scheme for CAA problems	In the implementation of spectral difference (SD) method, the conserved variables at the flux points are calculated from the solution points using extrapolation or interpolation schemes. The errors incurred in using extrapolation and interpolation would result in instability. On the other hand, the difference between the left and right conserved variables at the edge interface will induce dissipation to the SD method when applying a Riemann solver to compute the common flux at the element interface. In this paper, an optimization of the extrapolation and interpolation schemes for the fourth order SD method is carried out in the wavenumber space through minimizing their dispersion error over a selected band of wavenumbers. The optimized coefficients of the extrapolation and interpolation are presented. And the dispersion error of the standard and optimized schemes is plotted and compared. An improvement of the dispersion error over the resolvable wavenumber range of SD method is obtained. The optimized SD solver is validated with four CAA workshop benchmark problems. The numerical results with optimized schemes agree much better with the analytical data than those with standard schemes. An improvement of the accuracy of the 4th order SD method for CAA problems is obtained. Copyright © 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

82755171681	Cross-layer scheduling with fairness for multi-user OFDM system: A restless bandit approach	In OFDM-based System such as long term evolution (LTE), the scheduling scheme plays an essential role in not only improving the capacity of system, but also guarantee the fairness among the user equipments (UEs). However, most existing work about scheduling only considers the current throughput in physical layer. Thus in this paper, a cross-layer scheduling with fairness based on restless bandit (CSFRB) scheme with the 'indexability' property is proposed for the multi-user orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system to minimize the distortion in the application layer, to maximize the throughput and to minimize the energy consumption in the physical layer. The scheduling problem is firstly established as a restless bandit problem, which is solved by the primal-dual index heuristic algorithm based on the first order relaxation with low complexity, to yield the CSFRB scheme. Additionally, this scheme is divided into offline computation and online selection, where main work will be finished in former one so as to decrease the complexity further. Finally, extensive simulation results illustrate the significant performance improvement of the proposed CSFRB scheme compared to the existing one in different scenarios. © 2011 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.

82055164300	A super resolution approach for spectral unmixing of remote sensing images	It is well known that coarse spatial resolution is an important factor for the occurrence of mixed pixels in remote sensing images, and conventional approaches for spectral unmixing adopt various techniques on spectral dimension only in a fixed spatial resolution. In this article, a super resolution (SR) approach for spectral unmixing is proposed, based on the assumption that increasing the spatial resolution helps to retrieve the composition of a pixel. Firstly, a remote sensing image is downscaled into an SR image using example-based kernel ridge regression (EBKRR). Secondly, the SR image is classified using supervised hard classification, and then the class map is decomposed into thematic class layers. Thirdly, the thematic class layers are upscaled into the original spatial resolution with an averaging operation, and the abundance maps are finally derived. In two simulated data-based experiments and one ground data-based experiment, this approach was compared with linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) and artificial neural network (ANN)-based spectral unmixing methods. The accuracy assessment indicated that the SR approach outperformed LSMA and ANN under measurements of mean absolute error and absolute bias in the three experiments. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

Cognitive packet network (CPN) has been designed for providing QoS routing. In this paper, to balance the loads among networks, we present a multi-path routing algorithm based on load-balance (MPRLB), which is carried out in two steps. The algorithm with low computational complexity is firstly applied to establish multi path routing for each source and destination node pairs (SD-pair) nodes in the network. Then, we propose the hopfield neural network algorithm, which is applied to improve the efficiency of the flow deviation method for fast flow allocation among the links of the network based on load balance.

84855175993	Resource allocation for load balancing and fairness improvement in relay-assisted OFDMA cellular	A resource allocation scheme with the considerations of user fairness and load balancing is proposed in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based relay networks. The optimal resource allocation scheme is formulated mathematically to maximize the minimum achievable rate among all user equipments (UEs) for fairness improvement. The optimal problem has been proved to be NP-hard and it is prohibitive to find the optimal solution for its computational complexity. Accordingly, this paper proposes a suboptimal scheme which considers not only user fairness but also load balancing among base stations (BS) and relay stations (RSs) during resource allocation procedure. The suboptimal scheme takes the traffic load of access nodes (BS and RSs) into consideration to balance the system traffic load, which would prevent them from overloading and throughput degradation. Simulation results show that the suboptimal scheme performs similarly to the optimal solution and can enhance the system fairness and load balancing performance significantly compared with the traditional schemes. © by HIGH TECHNOLOGY LETTERS PRESS.

84859503609	Cooperative communications with hierarchical modulation in downlink OFDMA based cellular networks	Cooperative transmission is a promising way to improve system performance in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based cellular networks. This paper proposes two heuristic cooperation schemes including relay selection and resource allocation using hierarchical modulation (HM) to fully exploit the radio resources in cellular networks where user equipments (UEs) relay for each other. The relay selection procedure considers both the channel conditions and the energies left in relays to make the cooperative communications behave better. To mitigate the spectrum efficiency loss due to the half-duplex mode, the bits of relay-aided UE and its relay (which is also a UE) are transmitted simultaneously in one sub-channel using HM to improve the utilization efficiency of sub-channels. Besides, time resources are used effectively with the adaptively changed proportion of the two sub-frames divided for relay transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can improve the spectrum efficiency compared with the traditional schemes.

84859509417	Opportunistic best-relay node selection for cooperative transmission improvement over underlay cognitive radio networks	In cognitive radio (CR) relay networks, most previous work concentrates on maximizing physical layer quality of service (QoS), e.g., spectral efficiency and achievable data rate, as relay selection criteria. However, the residual energy state of relay nodes is largely ignored, which has significant effects on the average network lifetime for those battery-limited wireless networks. In this paper, an opportunistic distributed best-relay node selection scheme is proposed for cooperative transmissions over underlay-paradigm based CR networks, and meanwhile guarantee that the primary link is provided with a minimum-rate for a certain percentage of time. The objective is to increase achievable data rate as well as prolong average network lifetime. Specifically, both the instantaneous channel state information (ICSI) and residual energy of candidate relay nodes are taken as weighted metric, and the relay node with the optimal weighted metric is selected as the best one. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Most of previous works mainly have focused on the multiplexing-diversity tradeoff or switching between multiplexing and diversity without considering the property of heterogeneous QoS provisioning. In this paper, switching between multiplexing and diversity in MIMO system with the heterogeneous QoS provisioning is studied. Firstly the QoS provisioning for users are classified into two classes: users with real time service requirement and users with non-real time service requirement respectively. Then based on the heterogeneous QoS Provisioning for users, two different switching criterions are proposed, switching based on the Euclidean distance for users with real time service to minimize the probability of symbol error and capacity-based switching criterion for users with non-real time service to maximize the transmission capacity respectively. Finally, numerical simulation results are illustrated to demonstrate the performance of proposed scheme.

Some issues in SRSU, such as the role of training database, remain unclear. According to the example-based SR reconstruction, training databases impact the reconstruction and consequently may also impact SRSU. This study investigated how training databases affect the SRSU, so the training database can be designed appropriately. A Markov network model was employed as a way to implement SR reconstruction. Ten training databases, derived from different types of remotely sensed images and non-remotely sensed images, were constructed and each training database-based SRSU was evaluated with respect to unmixing accuracy. Surprisingly, the experiments revealed that the SRSU performance is not sensitive to the types of training databases, since different training databases resulted in similar accuracy in spectral unmixing. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

For high-speed railway environment, call admission control mechanism needs to be designed in order to admit more users when system bandwidth resource becomes scare. In this paper, a call admission control mechanism based on spring model is proposed. Although system bandwidth resource is occupied by existing users, a part of bandwidth resource can still be borrowed from them on condition that their lowest qualities of service could be guaranteed. Therefore, every existing service is regarded as a spring that can be compressed to some extent. Handover users who have higher priority than new users can be admitted by the above bandwidth resource borrowing strategy. Moreover, birth-death process is used to analyze dropping probability and blocking probability. Simulation results show that dropping probability of handover users is lower than blocking probability of new users. In addition, dropping probability of voice service is lower than that of data and video services. © 2011 IEEE.

84863192548	Optimal distributed power allocation for a new spectrum sharing paradigm in cognitive radio networks	The problem of power allocation in cognitive radio networks plays an important role to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization. However, most of previous works focus on the power allocation for secondary users in spectrum sharing overlay or spectrum sharing underlay, which needs to frequently handoff between the idle spectrum bands or considers the interference constraints in all spectrum bands respectively. In order to reduce the handoff and fully utilize the spectrum resource, we propose a new spectrum sharing paradigm which not only can just need to adjust the transmit power in spectrum bands instead of frequently handoff between idle spectrum bands, but can fully utilize the spectrum resource as we only consider the interference power constraints in active spectrum bands rather than in all spectrum bands. Then based on this new spectrum sharing paradigm and the constraint conditions, we study the distributed power allocation for secondary users and formulate the optimization problem as a non-cooperative game problem, after that the variational inequality approach is used to solve this game problem and a Nash equilibria solution is got, finally simulation results are illustrated to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme. © 2012 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.

In order to distinguish between the real fault and false alarm, fuzzy cognitive maps theory is introduced to set up the monitoring model. By adjusting the weighting rules in the model, different observing points may realize flexible judgment of the link failure risk in their authorities. After locating the fault roots, original recovery method for individual networks may be used to rescue the broken transmission.

It makes the interaction between people and things more active and provides the connection among different existing networks. Ubiquitous short-range wireless access and cognitive radio are key technologies for the IoT's realization. This paper deals with some problems in an integrated system of wireless local area network (WLAN) and cognitive radio - cognitive WLAN over fiber (CWLANoF). CWLANoF is a cost-effective and efficient architecture that combines radio over fiber and cognitive radio technologies to provide centralized radio resource management and equal spectrum access in infrastructure-based IEEE 802.11 WLANs. In this paper, a reinforcement learning approach is applied to implement dynamic channel selection in CWLANoF. The cognitive access points select the best channels among the industrial, scientific, and medical band for data packet transmission, given that the objective is to minimize external interference and acquire better network-wide performance. The reinforcement learning method avoids solving complex optimization problems while being able to explore the states of a CWLANoF system during normal operations. Simulation results reveal that the proposed strategy is effective in avoiding aggregated interference, reducing outage probability, and improving network throughput.

In order to improve the spatial predictive accuracy of soil organic matter, a multivariate geospatial method for making retrieval model was presented in this paper. Considering the spatial distribution characteristic of regression error, a multivariate geostatistical method called ordinary Kriging with varying local means (OKLM) was presented, which was used to construct remote sensing retrieval model. The method was illustrated using soil organic matter (SOM) content in Southwest Sichuan province, and wascompared with other method, such as ordinary Kriging, ordinary remote sensing retrieval method, and remote sensing retrieval model based on regression Kriging. The results showedthe proposed method improved the predictive accuracy effectively among these methods, because the proposed method was based on relations between SOM sampling data and TM images using spatial statistics, taking fully into account the spatial relations among the data, and obtained more accurate retrieval model.compared with regression Kriging, OKLM assumed that the means of regression errors cannot always be zero in local neighborhood, which was more in line with the actual situation. The proposed method provides a scientific basis for the farmland nutrient management and sustainable development of the regional agricultural.

84870537646	Small-scale evaluation of tobacco planting suitability based on spatial information technology	Crop planting suitability evaluation is important for agricultural production. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation framework which combined geographical information system, remote sensing, global position system and geostatistics with other models was presented to evaluate the tobacco planting suitability on a small scale. Ten indicators from three respects of climate, terrain and soil nutrients were selected to build evaluation indicator system. The results show that 70% of study area is suitable for tobacco planting. However, the spatial distribution of current tobacco fields is some degree of irrationality, and 20% of fields are located in moderate or not suitable area. Through scale analysis of the arable land, the suitable fields are mainly distributed in the middle and southern parts of the study area, which is 6324.5 ha. © 2012 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

84871419520	Spectral unmixing of remote sensing images using interpolation of wavelet coefficients	This paper proposes a wavelet coefficient interpolation method, which uses the neighboring information in the spatial domain for spectral unmixing of remote sensing images. A super-resolution image is first generated using bilinear interpolation of wavelet coefficients. The new image is then classified to derive a super-resolution classification map. Finally, an abundance map at the original spatial resolution is obtained using a counting window on the super-resolution classification map. This way, the original image is unmixed. A simulated TM image of Guangzhou City is used to verify the proposed method. It is found that the method performs best among three methods as it can make use of neighboring information in the space to improve unmixing accuracy.

84871890789	Coalition-based downlink resource allocation for LTE system with divide-and-conquer approach	To take advantage of the multiuser diversity resulted from the variation in channel conditions among the users, it has become an interesting and challenging problem to efficiently allocate the resources such as subcarriers, bits, and power. Most of current research concentrates on solving the resource-allocation problem for all users together in a centralized way, which brings about high computational complexity and makes it impractical for real system. Therefore, a coalitional game framework for downlink multi-user resource allocation in long term evolution (LTE) system is proposed, based on the divide-and-conquer idea. The goal is to maximize the overall system data rate under the constraints of each user's minimal rate requirement and maximal transmit power of base station while considering the fairness among users. In this framework, a coalitional formation algorithm is proposed to achieve optimal coalition formation and a two-user bargaining algorithm is designed to bargain channel assignment between two users. The total computational complexity is greatly reduced in comparison with conventional methods. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms acquire a good tradeoff between the overall system throughout and fairness, compared to maximal rate and max-min schemes. © 2012 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.

84871917065	Systematic energy-balanced cooperative transmission scheme in wireless sensor networks	Energy efficiency is a critical issue in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In order to minimize energy consumption and balance energy dissipation throughout the whole network, a systematic energy-balanced cooperative transmission scheme in WSNs is proposed in this paper. This scheme studies energy efficiency in systematic view. For three main steps, namely nodes clustering, data aggregation and cooperative transmission, corresponding measures are put forward to save energy. These measures are well designed and tightly coupled to achieve optimal performance. A half-controlled dynamic clustering method is proposed to avoid concentrated distribution of cluster heads caused by selecting cluster heads randomly and to get high spatial correlation between cluster nodes. Based on clusters built, data aggregation, with the adoption of dynamic data compression, is performed by cluster heads to get better use of data correlation. Cooperative multiple input multiple output (CMIMO) with an energy-balanced cooperative cluster heads selection method is proposed to transmit data to sink node. System model of this scheme is also given in this paper. And simulation results show that, compared with other traditional schemes, the proposed scheme can efficiently distribute the energy dissipation evenly throughout the network and achieve higher energy efficiency, which leads to longer network lifetime span. By adopting orthogonal space time block code (STBC), the optimal number of the cooperative transmission nodes varying with the percentage of cluster heads is also concluded, which can help to improve energy efficiency by choosing the optimal number of cooperative nodes and making the most use of CMIMO. © 2012 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.

84871991072	Radio admission control scheme for high-speed railway communication with MIMO antennas	Along with the wide deployment of high-speed railway at more than 300 km/h, providing various services effectively for users in the train becomes both practical demand and interesting challenge for wireless communication. Due to the specific environment for high-speed railway, existing radio admission control (RAC) algorithms could not suit the requirements such as frequent handover, quick decision-making duration and fast-changing physical transmission condition. The investigation on novel and proper RAC is of great importance. In this paper, we propose an effective radio admission control scheme based on Rician shading model for high-speed railway communication with MIMO antennas. Layered networks access architecture is designed in which Rician channel is used to analyze physical transmission condition. The effect of bit error rate on data rate at high moving speeds is taken into account for the RAC decision-making to get better quality of service (QoS). Moreover, different priorities for different services are considered to resolve simultaneous multiple users' access requests. Simulation results have proved that the proposed scheme may improve QoS obviously compared to the scheme that does not consider bit error rate and service priority. © 2012 IEEE.

84873292139	A queuing time aware dynamic Grid workflow scheduling model based on repairable queuing system	The reliability of a Grid resource site will affect the execution performance of tasks on the site, which will bring effect on the queuing time of other tasks on this site. M/M/C repairable queuing system is adopted to establish a comprehensive evaluation model, which is used to describe the reliability and dynamic processing capacity of Grid resource in multi-cluster environment. This model considers not only the possible failures of Grid resource, but also the dynamic workloads of resource sites, which makes it be close to practical Grid systems. On the basis of the resource reliability evaluation model, a queuing time aware dynamic Grid workflow scheduling model and the corresponding algorithm is proposed. The QTADGWS algorithm uses the list based method, and tries to achieve great performance by overlapping data transfer time and queuing time.

84874330585	Novel flow control mechanism based on improved BP neural network in cognitive packet network	In this paper, a novel flow control mechanism in cognitive packet network (CPN) based on the improved back propagation (BP) neural network is proposed, considering the flow distribution status predicted by BP neural network when packets are routed. The objective is to increase the capacity of CPN and improve the quality of service (QoS) by achieving flow balance. Besides, considering the slow convergence speed of traditional BP algorithm and the quick change of the flow status in cognitive packet network, an improved BP algorithm with dynamic learning rate is designed in order to achieve a higher convergence speed. The mechanism, which we propose, regards the predicated traffic data as an important factor when packets are routed to implement flow control. By achieving balance, the quality of network can be improved obviously. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism provides better average time delay and packets loss ratio.

84875272656	Green cell association for multimedia transmission in cognitive heterogeneous networks	With the introduction of low-powered pico/femto-base stations and relay nodes into the macro-cell, recent heterogeneous networks provide an attractive approach for future wireless communication. Although it may achieve better coverage and higher capacity, several problems remain unsolved before practical deployment. For example, how to select the proper cell from neighbor low-powered cells and then occupy the radio resource without interference on macro-users is both important and challenging, especially for rigorous multimedia applications. The traditional cell access algorithms and quality-control parameters such as delay or throughput no longer suit well in this complex environment. An effective approach should be pursued. In this paper, we investigate this interesting cell association problem and propose a complete green resolution on the basis of thorough discussions about the multimedia transmission under these concerns. Cognitive radio is introduced to share spectrum between macro-cell and low-powered cells while securing the transmission of authorized macro-users. We also bring forth the concept of 'interference balance' to better manage the overall interference and energy consumption in the network. Restless bandit model is formulated on the basis of channel state, data rate, interference control, and the carefully chosen intra-refreshing rate for multimedia traffic. Then the cell association scheme is designed to be efficient and practical because of the simple index property of our model output. Simulation results have proven the performance of our proposed resolution compared with existing algorithms on interference constraint, multimedia distortion, and overall network energy consumption balance.

84875797764	Deadline guarantee enhanced scheduling of scientific workflow applications in grid	Many scientific workflow applications often have deadline constraint such that all tasks of application need to be finished within user-specified time. Though Grid systems have high performance, which provide an important infrastructure for executing scientific workflow, dynamic nature of Grid resources makes it very difficult to schedule workflow and satisfy the given deadline. For this issue, a M/M/C queuing model was adopted to model dynamic service capacity of grid resource. Under dynamic, unreliable grid environment, based on queuing system theory, a probability of meeting deadline for each task can be calculated. The detail analytic method and proof was given in the paper. Specifically, a novel probability evaluation based scheduling algorithm is proposed to address the problem of workflow' deadline guarantee. The results of large scale simulation experiments with real Protein annotation workflow demonstrate that our algorithm can remarkably improve the predictability of workflow completion and guarantee user's deadline requirements. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

84876480695	Layered fault management scheme for end-to-end transmission in internet of things	Internet of things (IoT) points out an inspiring road towards intelligent world of real-time information collection and interaction among people and entities. It may provide various applications by connecting all the existing communication networks. To ensure the reliability of end-to-end transmission in the hierarchical environments, fault management is of great importance. Current relative algorithms are designed for specific network, not suited to these complex conditions. Meanwhile, the utilization of existing facilities should be considered for implementation feasibility. In this paper, we propose a layered fault management scheme for IoT with uniform fault managing procedure control and separate layer functions. Flexible and effective monitoring model would be set in selected observing points around the networks. Advanced fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) is adopted to realize integrated evaluation and prediction of the possible fault. The observing points could adjust the weighting rule in the model to suit the practical network condition and work independently. After further confirmation among neighbor points, fault recovery therapy could be handed over to the corresponding network with existing counter-measures. The proposed design suits well to the efficiency and feasibility requirements of IoT. Simulation results further prove its desirable behavior. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Resource allocation problem in high-speed railway communication system is one of the key issues to improve the efficiency of resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a multidimensional resource allocation strategy for high-speed railway downlink orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas. Sub-carrier, antenna, time slot, and power are considered jointly, which is modeled as a nonlinear integer programming problem. The effect of the moving speed on inter-carrier interference is analyzed to calculate the transmitted power. The objective is to minimize the total transmitted power while satisfying quality of service requirement of each user. Moreover, optimal and approximate solutions are obtained by linearization and quadratic fitting, respectively. Simulation results have proved that approximate solution has lower total transmitted power than optimal solution while the computation complexity is higher. © 2012 IEEE.

84877684367	Coalition Graph Game for joint relay selection and resource allocation in cooperative cognitive radio networks	Cooperative relaying technology among secondary users (SUs) in cognitive radio networks (CRN) is shown to yield a significant performance improvement, such as improving spectrum utilization as well as system fairness in CRN. This paper investigates the problem of the relay selection and resource allocation in a downlink OFDMA cognitive relay network. The objective of this optimization problem is to maximize both system throughput and system fairness, which is achieved through our proposed non-transferable utility coalition graph game algorithm (NTU-CGGA). In this algorithm, the SUs with more available channels can help SUs with less available channels to improve their utility in terms of the throughput and fairness by forming a directed tree graph. The coalition graph is formatted according to spectrum availability and traffic demands of SUs by using merge-split rule. So it can effectively exploit both space and frequency diversity of the system. Simulation results show that, NTU-CGGA significantly improves system throughput while not reducing the fairness level, which has a better performance comparing with other existing algorithms. © 2012 IEEE.

84878695215	Adaptive minimum bit feedback for sum-rate analysis in multi-user distributed antenna systems	The paper mainly studies the sum-rate performance of limited feedback (LFB) block-diagonalization (BD) in multi-user distributed antenna system (DAS). As the channel state information (CSI) fed back to base station (BS) is limited, multi-user interference (MUI) is caused inevitably because of the quantization error. Considering the influence of the MUI to the capacity of DAS, we propose a parameter of effective sum-rate ratio (ESRR) to denote the capacity offset under the condition of the BS can get perfect CSI and limited CSI first, then we confirm that the approximated ESRR is very close to actual ESRR got through simulations. After that, based on the approximated ESRR, an adaptive minimum bit feedback scheme which can effectively reduce the overhead of feedback channel and the complexity of the system is proposed. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2013 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.

84878700400	Resource allocation algorithm in LTE uplink SC-FDMA system for time-varying channel with imperfect channel state information	In long term evolution (LTE) uplink single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) system, the restriction that multiple resource blocks (RBs) allocated to a user should be adjacent, makes the resource allocation problem hard to solve. Moreover, with the practical constraint that perfect channel state information (CSI) cannot be obtained in time-varying channel, the resource allocation problem will become more difficult. In this paper, an efficient resource allocation algorithm is proposed in LTE uplink SC-FDMA system with imperfect CSI assumption. Firstly, the resource allocation problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. Then an efficient algorithm based on discrete stochastic optimization is proposed to solve the problem.

84880437354	Potential of NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery for modeling the regional economy of China	Historically, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) was the unique satellite sensor used to collect the nighttime light, which is an efficient means to map the global economic activities. Since it was launched in October 2011, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Satellite has become a new satellite used to monitor nighttime light. This study performed the first evaluation on the NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery in modeling economy, analyzing 31 provincial regions and 393 county regions in China. For each region, the total nighttime light (TNL) and gross regional product (GRP) around the year of 2010 were derived, and a linear regression model was applied on the data. Through the regression, the TNL from NPP-VIIRS were found to exhibit R2 values of 0.8699 and 0.8544 with the provincial GRP and county GRP, respectively, which are significantly stronger than the relationship between the TNL from DMSP-OLS (F16 and F18 satellites) and GRP. Using the regression models, the GRP was predicted from the TNL for each region, and we found that the NPP-VIIRS data is more predictable for the GRP than those of the DMSP-OLS data. This study demonstrates that the recently released NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery has a stronger capacity in modeling regional economy than those of the DMSP-OLS data. These findings provide a foundation to model the global and regional economy with the recently availability of the NPP-VIIRS data, especially in the regions where economic census data is difficult to access. © 2013 by the authors.

84880510604	Green access point selection for wireless local area networks enhanced by cognitive radio	In wireless local area networks (WLANs) made up of Extended Service Sets, access point (AP) selection is a key issue to improve the network performance and balance the traffic load. WLANs operating in the shared Industrial, Scientific and Medical band can benefit from the use of cognitive radio (CR) techniques to enable dynamic access to spectrum holes that are free from interference. In this paper, we propose an optimal Green AP Selection (GAPS) scheme, in which AP selection is optimized to maximize the system throughput while minimizing the energy consumption, for multi-rate WLANs enhanced by CRs. Different from most existing AP selection schemes, GAPS takes into account of the state transition tendency of APs and the influence of Automatic Rate Fallback mechanism in the Distributed Coordination Function. The AP selection problem is formulated as a restless bandit problem and solved by the primal-dual index heuristic algorithm based on first order relaxation to yield the GAPS scheme with the "indexability" property and hence a low complexity. GAPS is further divided into offline computation, which accounts for the bulk of the computations, and online selection, with a low complexity to facilitate implementation. Extensive simulation results illustrate the significant performance improvements of GAPS compared with existing AP selection schemes in different scenarios. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84880282660	Joint user pairing and power allocation in uplink virtual MIMO with imperfect CSI	User pairing strategy for virtual multi-input multi-output (VMIMO) has been widely studied to improve system throughput, but most studies are based on perfect channel state information (CSI) and uniform power allocation. However, perfect CSI is very difficult or even impossible to obtain in practical system. Moreover power allocation has significant impact on algorithm performance. Therefore, in this paper, a low-complex joint user pairing and power allocation algorithm based on aggressive discrete stochastic optimization and Lagrangian dual solution is proposed for uplink VMIMO with imperfect CSI. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve desirable throughput performance, and restrict inter-user interference (IUI) efficiently. © 2013 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.

84914675805	Multichannel cooperative sensing for cognitive radio with users owning heterogeneous sensing ability	Multichannel cooperative sensing (MCS) is an effective method for dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. In contrast to most existing work on MCS that considered secondary users with homogeneous sensing ability, this paper studies the MCS problem for secondary users with heterogeneous sensing ability in terms of sensing accuracy. We further take into account different parameters of primary channels such as bandwidth, probability of being idle in each sensing period, and frequency selective fading at the sensing receiver. The MCS problem is formulated as a weapon target assignment problem, where more sensing resources are assigned to channels that are more valuable. This weapon target assignment problem is transformed to an integer generalized network flow problem with convex flow costs to obtain the lower bound solution, and then solved by the branch and bound algorithm with this bound to yield the exact scheme. To reduce computational complexity, a heuristic scheme is also proposed, which has approximate performance compared with the exact scheme. Finally, extensive simulation results for different scenarios illustrate the performance improvements of the proposed schemes over the existing scheme.
