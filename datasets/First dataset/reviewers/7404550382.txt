17144391406	Simultaneous and ultrarapid determination of reactive oxygen species and reduced glutathione in apoptotic leukemia cells by microchip electrophoresis	A microchip electrophoresis method coupled with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection was established for simultaneous determination of two kinds of intracellular signaling molecules (reactive oxygen species, ROS, and reduced glutathione, GSH) related to apoptosis and oxidative stress. As the probe dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR-123) can be converted intracellularly by ROS to the fluorescent rhodamine-123 (Rh-123), and the probe naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde (NDA) can react quickly with GSH to produce a fluorescent adduct, rapid determination of Rh-123 and GSH was achieved on a glass microchip within 27 s using a 20 mM borate buffer (pH 9.2). The established method was tested to measure the intracellular ROS and GSH levels in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived NB4 cells. An elevation of intracellular ROS and depletion of GSH were observed in apoptotic NB4 cells induced by arsenic trioxide (As

23244447397	Development of an in vitro multicellular tumor spheroid model using microencapsulation and its application in anticancer drug screening and testing	In this study, an in vitro multicellular tumor spheroid model was developed using microencapsulation, and the feasibility of using the microencapsulated multicellular tumor spheroid (MMTS) to test the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs was investigated. Human MCF-7 breast cancer cells were encapsulated in alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate (APA) microcapsules, and a single multicellular spheroid 150 μm in diameter was formed in the microcapsule after 5 days of cultivation. The cell morphology, proliferation, and viability of the MMTS were characterized using phase contrast microscopy, BrdU-labeling, MTT stain, calcein AM/ED-2 stain, and H&E stain. It demonstrated that the MMTS was viable and that the proliferating cells were mainly localized to the periphery of the cell spheroid and the apoptotic cells were in the core. The MCF-7 MMTS was treated with mitomycin C (MC) at a concentration of 0.1, 1, or 10 times that of peak plasma concentration (ppc) for up to 72 h. The cytotoxicity was demonstrated clearly by the reduction in cell spheroid size and the decrease in cell viability. The MMTS was further used to screen the anticancer effect of chemotherapeutic drugs, treated with MC, adriamycin (ADM) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10 ppc for 24, 48, and 72 h. MCF-7 monolayer culture was used as control. Similar to monolayer culture, the cell viability of MMTS was reduced after treatment with anticancer drugs. However, the inhibition rate of cell viability in MMTS was much lower than that in monolayer culture. The MMTS was more resistant to anticancer drugs than monolayer culture. The inhibition rates of cell viability were 68.1%, 45.1%, and 46.8% in MMTS and 95.1%, 86.8%, and 91.6% in monolayer culture treated with MC, ADM, and 5-FU at 10 ppc for 72 h, respectively. MC showed the strongest cytotoxicity in both MMTS and monolayer, followed by 5-FU and ADM. It demonstrated that the MMTS has the potential to be a rapid and valid in vitro model to screen chemotherapeutic drugs with a feature to mimic in vivo three-dimensional (3-D) cell growth pattern. © 2005 American Chemical Society and American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

The parameters included the applied potential (U), the distribution of electrostatic field, the frequency and the flow rate of solution through the capillary. Furthermore, the process is analyzed with the theory of jet break-up in electrostatic field. The result showed that the modified symmetrical electrostatic field was more advantageous in preparing the monodispersed gel beads than the traditional method. Meanwhile, gel beads with good monodispersity (CV<20%) and stability without aggregation were produced under a range of applied potential (U), frequency and flow rate of solution through the capillary.

25444505992	The enzymatic degradation and swelling properties of chitosan matrices with different degrees of N-acetylation	In the design of chitosan-based drug delivery systems and implantable scaffolds, the biodegradation rate of the chitosan matrix represents a promising strategy for drug delivery and the function of carriers. In this study, we have investigated the degradation of chitosan with different degrees of N-acetylation, with respect to weight loss, water absorption, swelling behavior, molecular weight loss of bulk materials, and reducing sugar content in the media. Chitosan matrices were prepared by compression molding. The results revealed that the initial degradation rate, equilibrium water absorption, and swelling degree increased with decreasing degree of deacetylation (DD) and a dramatic rise began as DD of the chitosan matrix decreased to 62.4%. Chitosan matrices with DD of 52.6%, 56.1%, and 62.4% had the weight half-life of 9.8, 27.3, and more than 56 days, respectively, and the weight half-life of average molecular weight 8.4, 8.8, and 20.0 days, respectively. For chitosan matrices with DD of 71.7%, 81.7%, and 93.5%, both types of half-life exceeded 84 days because of the much slower degradation rate. The dimension of chitosan matrices during degradation was determined by the process of swelling and degradation. These findings may help to design chitosan-based biomedical materials with predetermined degradation timed from several days to months and proper swelling behaviors. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

27644589655	Biological evaluation of transplantation of sodium alginate/chitosan microcapsule into abdominal cavity of rats	Aim: The study certificates that the sodium alginate/chitosan microcapsule, which has certain permeability and immunity insulation peculiarit, gains better effects on the cell culture in vitro, but the phenomena of cell sticky and fibrosis emerge in different degree when implanted in vivo. Therefore, the transplantation effect of sodium alginate/chitosan microcapsule as immunity insulation carrier used for cell transplantation was evaluated primarily. Methods: The experiment was done in the Lab of Biomedical Material Engineering, Department of Biotechnology, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences between March and July 2004. The self-restraint static electricity drip generator made the calcium alginate gelatum micro-beads. The sodium alginate solution of certain concentration neutralization, after making into membrane, with calcium alginate microbeads, the sodium alginate/chitosan microcapsule was gained. After the digestion of the logarithm growth L929 cells, they were mixed with the sodium alginate solutions, and then moved into the static electricity drip generator to make the close packing cell microcapsule. Eighty-four male and female (half and half) mice were selected and assigned randomly into 7 groups with 12 mice in each group. 1 To observe the effects of materials on the transplantation comparatively: The mice in three groups were obtained, and the mice in each group were treated with pure calcium alginate gelatum beads, sodium alginate of chitosan membrane and chitosan membrane/ sodium alginate microcapsule that the extra-layer was neutralized with sodium alginate. The microcapsule retrievability rate was observed at the 7th day and the 14th day after transplantation. 2 To observe the effects of granulation diameter on the transplantation comparatively: The other two group of mice were selected, and were treated with the sodium alginate/chitosan microcapsule with around 200 μm and around 500 μm granulation diameter. The microcapsule retrievability rate was observed at the 1st, 4th, and 14th days after transplatation. 3 To observe the effects of the existence of the cells on the transplantation: Two groups of mice were gained and treated with empty microcapsule and packing microcapsule with L 929 cells. The microcapsule retrievability rate was observed at the 4th and 14th days after transplantation. The retrievability rate =(Retrieving microcapsule volume/transplantation microcapsule volume) ×100%. Results: Totally 84 mice were involved in the result analysis. 1 The microcapsule retrievability rate in different materials: The adherence induced by gelatum beads forming membrane of chitosan was the most serious. Followed by the microcapsule after neutralizing of the outer layer sodium alginate, while there was no adherence of the pure sodium alginate gelatum beads within the inspection time. 2 The microcapsule retrievability rate in different granulation diameter: The adherence induced by mi-crocapsule with around 200 μm granulation diameter increased than that in-duced by microcapsule with around 500 μm granulation diameter, but the difference was insignificant. The collective character of the microcap-sule with around 200 μm granulation diameter led to the retrievability rate was lower than that of the microcapsule with around 500 μm granulation diame-ter. 3 The retrievability rate of the cell microcapsule and the empty mi-crocapsule: Compared with the empty microcapsule, the adherence degree of the close packing microcapsule increased significantly. Conclusion: Adherence degree increases slightly with the diameter; The chitosan is the main component induce to adherence, and the existence of cell enhances the adherence degree.

30444437466	Quantitative analysis of fibrosis formation on the microcapsule surface with the use of picro-sirius red staining, polarized light microscopy, and digital image analysis	Transplantation of microencapsulated cells shows potential to treat a variety of diseases. To improve the quality of microcapsules, efficient methods need to be established and standardized for the evaluation of biocompatibility of microcapsules. To this end, a microscopical method was developed to analyze quantitatively the degree of fibrotic overgrowth (FO), which serves as the index of biocompatibility. In this method, sections were stained with picro-sirius red and illuminated with a polarized light microscope. The images were digitized with the use of a computer-video system in which collagenous content was depicted by gray levels 1 to 255. Both the area of collagen and the thickness of FO were examined. The ratio of Type I/Type III collagen and the thickness were used as indexes of the degree of FO. The data showed that the ratio of Type I/Type III collagen and the thickness increased with time, and FO was not significant 4 weeks after transplantation. In comparison, this new method is more efficient to evaluate FO. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

30944462181	Behavior of microbial growth and metabolism in alginate-chitosan-alginate (ACA) microcapsules	Cell microencapsulation is one of the promising biotechnological processes for immobilized cell culture. In this work, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were entrapped in alginate-chitosan-alginate (ACA) microcapsules. The behavior of microencapsulated and non-encapsulated free cells were studied and simulated by mathematical models. The Gompertz and Richards function were modified and compared to describe the growth and metabolism of microencapsulated and free microbial cells for a better understanding of the growth and its optimization. The results showed that both of the modified Gompertz and Richards model could be used to describe the growth and metabolic process in ACA encapsulated culture as well as in free culture. Particularly, the modified Richards model was more suitable in describing the consumption of the controlling substrate due to the additional parameter, m, which described the shape of the three-parameter functions. The experimental data and the models highlighted that ACA microencapsulated culture could reach a higher maximum biomass concentration and a higher maximum biomass growth rate than in free culture. It is indicated that the ACA microcapsule could be used in immobilized microorganism culture, which offered favorable microenvironment for cell growth. The effects of status of ACA microcapsule cores on the cell growth and metabolism were further investigated. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the growth and metabolism of microencapsulated cells whether the cores of the microcapsules were solid or liquefied.

32844473869	Effect of pH of chitosan solution on properties of sodium alginate-chitosan microcapsules with cells	Sodium alginate-chitosan (AC) microcapsules are often used as the immobilization carriers for cell culture. They are composed of porous gel as the core facilitating cell adhesion, and coated with polyelectrolyte complex membrane protecting cells and allowing selective mass transfer. Therefore, the regulation and control of membrane properties can directly affect the growth and metabolism of cells in microcapsules. Among many parameters, pH of chitosan solution is the important one. In this paper, the formation of polyelectrolyte membrane, the degree of complex formation and protein diffusion at different pH values were directly observed in situ by using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). The effect of pH on the properties of AC microcapsule membrane was discussed. The optimal pH was determined in the preparation of AC microcapsules with different cells (animal and microbial cells). It was demonstrated that the membrane thickness showed 'high-low-high' shape, the swelling behavior of microcapsules 'low-high-low' shape and the protein diffusion across the membrane 'low-high-low' shape as a function of pH, the inflection points all appeared at pH=4.00 and 5.50. Combining with the sensitivity experiment of different kinds of cells to environment pH, it was suggested that the optimal pH of chitosan solution for AC microencapsulated animal cells was 5.50, AC microencapsulated E. coli cells 5.00, and AC microencapsulated yeast cells such as saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cere.) 4.50, respectively.

Certain aspects of the microenvironment (or niche) play critical roles in determining the fate of ES cells. Here, we reported the feasibility of using the technique of microencapsulation to study the interaction between ES cells and their tissue niche. ES cells' growth, viability, and differentiation in vitro were evaluated when they were enclosed in solid or liquefied core APA microcapsules. In comparison with those microcapsules with solid cores, the liquefied capsules provided a more suitable culture environment for the growth of ES cells. In addition, behavior of encapsulated ES cells in vivo was observed after their being implanted into mouse peritoneal cavities. In contrast to the prolonged lag phase in vitro, ES cells encapsulated grew much faster in vivo. Typical markers for the undifferentiated ES cells, such as AP, SSEA-1, and Oct-4 gene, were also tracked by immunochemistry and RT-PCR. Results showed that expression of markers remained high over 2 weeks of culture in vitro. However, decreased expression of markers was found in those samples in vivo with time passage. These findings implied that it was the combination of the intrinsic characteristics of ES cells and their microenvironment that regulated their fate. The APA-ES cells system may provide an optimal model to study the interaction between stem cells and their tissue niches. © 2006 American Chemical Society and American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

ES cells aggregation is important for embryoid bodies (EBs) formation and the subsequent generation of ES cell derivatives. This study was conducted to describe scalable production of EBs by the rotary cell culture system (RCCS, STLV type) and estimate the feasibility of constructing engineered cardiac tissue (ECT). In comparison with suspension culture in a Petri dish, the efficiency of the dynamic process was analyzed with respect to the yield of EB formation and their cardiomyocyte differentiation. Cardiomyocyte differentiation was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis. After the elementary enrichment by gradient percoll, ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes were applied to construct ECT. Cell gross morphology, spatial distribution, and ultrastructure were evaluated by using histological analysis, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Results showed that EB efficiencies in STLV were nearly 1.5-2.0 times higher than that of liquid suspension cultures, and cardiomyocyte differentiation of EBs progressed in a normal course after the dynamic cultivation in STLV. Additionally, the differentiated cultures could be enriched elementarily by gradient percoll. Once cast into the collagen strand, cells grew well and became more matured in Petri dishes. Synchronous contraction of the cell cluster was observed on the surface of the ECT, and cell connection was also established. It was the first report to have beating ES-derived cardiomyocytes on a 3-D collagen scaffold, which might provide a promising model for physiological and pharmacological studies and tissue replacement therapy. © 2006 American Chemical Society and American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

Methods: We used a recombinant nerve growth factor (pcDNA3.1+/NGF) to modify NIH3T3 cells genetically. Control of NIH3T3-NGF cells were encapsulated within microspheres composed of alginate-poly-L-lysine- alginate and cultivated in-vitro. The concentration of NGF released from the microencapsulated NIH3T3-NGF cells was confirmed using ELISA assay. We co-cultivated microencapsulated NIH3T3-NGF cells, NIH3T3 cells (control) with human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, and tested the percentage of cycle of these cells. The alkaline hydrolysis method was used to analyse the content of hydroxyproline (Hyp). Immunohistochemistry method was used to calculate the transformation efficiency from fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Results: The concentration of NGF released from the microencapsulated NIH3T3-NGF cells lasted about six weeks in the supernatant of bioengineered dermis in-vitro. The proliferation of keratinocytes, as well as the concentration of Hyp in supernatant of fibroblasts, were promoted about three times. Transformation efficiency from fibroblasts to myofibroblasts was increased approximately two-fold because of the bio-effects of NGF. Two kinds of microencapsulations were seeded into collagen which contained human fibroblasts to form bioengineered skin. Microencapsulated NIH3T3-NGF cells formed a thicker dermis. The concentration of Hyp in the bioengineered skin which indicated the level of collagen synthesis was increased due to existing NGF. Conclusion: Microencapsulated NIH3T3-NGF cells can be used to enhance performance of bioengineered dermis and it also can be deduced that other cytokines can be used to treat local wound areas.

33744777237	Novel method to prepare porous chitosan membrane in situ pore formation by selective enzymatic degradation	A novel approach for the in situ pore formation in chitosan membranes based on the selective enzymatic polymer degradation. Moderately deacetylated chitosan (MDC) was blended with highly deacetylated chitosan (HDC) in certain ratios in solution and the solution was cast to obtain chitosan membranes. The degradation was conducted in phosphate buffer solution by monitoring weight loss and reducing sugar. FTIR and SEM observation results revealed that the component of MDC in chitosan blend membranes was selectively degraded by lysozyme and then removed from the membranes. When containing half MDC, the blend membranes underwent obvious degradation and the resulted membranes exhibited a nano-scale porous structure. This method is expected as potential candidate for preparation of porous chitosan membranes in biomedical use.

In this paper, human hepatocarcinoma SMMC-7721 cells were encapsulated in alginate-poly-l-lysine-alginate (APA) microcapsules and the behavior of the cells in the restricted three-dimensional culture system was investigated. The cells were polygonal-shaped, proliferating with high viability, and formed a single multicellular spheroid in microcapsule. During the assembly of the aggregate in microcapsule, cytoskeletal reorganization and repolorization was occurred, which was absent in cells cultured in monolayer. The in vivo-like cytoarchitecture was confirmed by the phalloidin-FITC labeling of F-actin filaments. The trabecular structure revealed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the bile canaliculus with multiple microvilli and tight junctions revealed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) was found in microencapsulated cells, which exhibited the ultrastructural characteristics of native hepatic tissue. It suggested that microcapsule culture provides an in vivo-like model which can be used for the study of the interactions of cell-cell and cell-microenvironment, and the mechanisms of invasion, metastasis and multicellular drug resistance of tumor cells. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

33745714145	A preliminary study on fabrication of nanoscale fibrous chitosan membranes in situ by biospecific degradation	A new approach for in situ fabrication of nanoscale fibrous chitosan membrane by biospecific degradation under physiological situation was studied. The chitosan binary blend membranes were fabricated by solvent casting of chitosan solution containing highly deacetylated chitosan (HDC) and moderately deacetylated chitosan (MDC) with different ratio. The biodegradation process was performed in PBS (pH 7.4) containing lysozyme at the temperature of 37 °C. Experimental results from weight loss, reducing sugar in surrounding media, FT-IR, X-ray diffraction, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and SEM throughout the study showed that the biospecific degradation by lysozyme had removed MDC component selectively. When the ratio of MDC in the binary blend membranes amounted to 0.5, nanoscale domains of HDC and MDC were obtained, and thus a nanoscale fibrous structure was fabricated after biospecific degradation of MDC. This nanofibrous structure and the biospecific degradation of chitosan membranes can have potential advantages and interesting implications in tissue engineering and drug delivery. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33746864964	K562 cell growth activity and metabolism characteristics in APA microencapsulated culture and modeling study	Cell microencapsulation is likely to play a major role in cell and transplantation therapies in the next decade. The microcapsules provide a special microenvironment in which cells always have different behaviors compared with free non-encapsulated culture. In this work, the behaviors of K562 leukemia cells were studied once entrapped in solid and liquefied APA microcapsules as well as in free non-encapsulated culture. Glucose pulse culture was employed to characterize the growth and metabolism of microencapsulated K562 cells. And mathematical modeling was presented to develop a basis for the deeper understanding of cells responses to different culture environments. Based on the results of experiments and modeling, it was found that cells presented a better growing pattern and maintain the activity at a higher level for extending time. The concentration of lactate was higher in solid microcapsules culture than that of liquefied microcapsules culture, but the cell number was lower. And the lactate yield coefficients (lactate/glucose) were 0.8129, 0.6978 and 0.601 for free non-encapsulated, solid microcapsules and liquefied microcapsules culture, respectively. An increase of glucose concentration led a decrease of cell activity, The glucose consumption ratio were 99.9%, 86.8%, 49.4% and 28.6% with the decrease in its concentration from 2 to 4, 6, 10 g/L, however, the lactate yield coefficient were 0.7184, 0.6654, 0.8239 and 0.9693, respectively. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The cell viability, proliferation, organization, and gene expression were evaluated by 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, hematoxylin and eosin staining, live/dead staining, 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine labeling, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Cell metabolism was determined by measuring glucose and lactate concentrations in medium. The results demonstrate that APA microcapsule with liquefied core provides a microenvironment for both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent cells to grow into a large cell aggregate and maintain cell viability at a constant level for a period of time. In conclusion, cells in APA microcapsule are alive and have proliferation potential with lower metabolism rate. APA microcapsule may be a useful tool for in vitro tumor cell modeling and anticancer drug screening as well as for cancer gene therapy. In addition, it lays a solid foundation for the use of microencapsulation in cell culture in vitro and cell implantation in vivo. Copyright © 2006 by Humana Press Inc.

33747365575	Construction of in vitro multicellular tumor spheroid model with microencapsulation and its application in anticancer drug screening	Aim: To prepare three-dimensional microencapsulated human breast cancer spheroid with electrostatic droplet generator and apply it in the screening of anticancer drug. Methods: The experiment was carried out at the Laboratory of Biomedical Materials, Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Science from February to July 2004. A method of microencapsulation with alginate and poly-L-lysine was developed to form APA human MCF-7 breast cancer multicellular spheroid of 125 μm in diameter after 5-day cultivation. The MCF-7 MMTS was treated with mitomycin C (MC), adriamycin (ADM) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at the concentrations of 0.1, 1 or 10 times of peak plasma concentration (ppc) for 24 hours, 48 hours or 72 hours and in various oxygen concentrations of environment. Then the diameter of spheroid was measured. Cellular morphology was observed under phase contrast microscope after stained by haematoxylin and eosin and the cellular activity was determined. Cellular activity in the microencapsulation was determined by MTT and the cellular proliferation was detected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Results: 1 Microencapsulated tumor cells could grow and proliferate into clump, in addition, consume glucose and produce lactic acid. Necrotic core appeared as the diameter of cell spheroid was enlarged. Proliferating cells were restricted to the outer two or three cellular layers in microencapsulated cells spheroid. 2 The diameter of cell spheroid in microcapsule reduced and the proliferative ability of cell increased by treatment with anticancer drug along with time going and the increase of drug concentration. It was found that the cell viability of MMTS was decreased after treatment with anticancer drugs, which was similar to monolayer culture. However, the inhibition rate of cell viability in MMTS was much lower than that in monolayer culture. MC showed the strongest cytotoxicity in both MMTS and monolayer; followed by 5-FU and ADM. 3 MMTS was more sensitive to anticancer drug with the increasing oxygen concentration of environment. Conclusion: It is concluded that the MMTS has the potential to be a rapid and valid in vitro model to screen chemotherapeutic drugs with a feature to mimic in vivo three-dimensional (3-D) cell growth pattern.

33747450884	Study on N-acetylated chitosans by FTIR and XRD	The degree of N-deacetylation (DD) is an important property of chitosan. In the present article, the reaction of N-acetylation was applied to prepare six chitosan samples with various DDs. The samples were studied by FTIR and XRD to investigate their IR absorbance characteristics and crystallinity, from which the DDs and crystallinity index (CrI) of chitosans were also determined respectively. The influence of N-acetylation on DD and CrI was also discussed, and it could be found from FTIR that the N-acetylation reaction became difficult for the remaining amino group in chitosan molecule as the reaction proceeded. XRD also indicated that the crystalline zone was broken by N-acetylation gradually, and another kind of crystal form appeared instead.

33750317837	Preparation and evaluation of floating-bioadhesive microparticles containing clarithromycin for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori	The development of a gastric floating-bioadhesive drug delivery system to increase the efficacy of clarithromycin against Helicobacter pylori is described. Floating-bioadhesive microparticles containing clarithromycin were prepared by a combined method of emulsification/evaporation and internal/ion gelation for the treatment of H. pylori infection. Ethylcellulose microspheres (EMs) were prepared by the dispersion of clarithromycin, ethylcellulose, and chitosan in dichloromethane and subsequent solvent evaporation. EMs were coated with alginate by the internal gelation process to obtain alginate-ethylcellulose microparticles (AEMs); then, AEMs were dispersed in a chitosan solution, and chitosanalginate-ethylcellulose microparticles (CAEMs) were obtained by ion gelation to enhance the bioadhesive properties. The morphologies of EMs and CAEMs were investigated under optical and scanning electron microscopes. In vitro buoyancy and drug-release testing confirmed the good floating and sustained-release properties of CAEMs. About 74% of the CAEMs floated in an acetate buffer solution for 8 h, and 90% of the clarithromycin contained in the CAEMs was released within 8 h in a sustained manner. In vivo mucoadhesive testing showed that 61% of the CAEMs could be retained in the stomach for 4 h. Under a pretreatment with omeprazole, the clarithromycin concentration in gastric mucosa of the CAEM group was higher than that of the clarithromycin solution group. These results suggest that CAEMs might be a promising drug delivery system for the treatment of H. pylori infection. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33845498838	cDNA microarray analysis of gene expression in Brassica napus treated with oligochitosan elicitor	An oilseed rape (Brassica napus H) cDNA microarray containing 8095 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was used to analyze the B. napus gene expression changes elicited by oligochitosan. Transcript levels for 393 genes were altered twofold or more in oligochitosan-treated seedlings compared to control seedlings. Of the 393 genes, 257 were repressed and 136 were induced. Semi quantification RT-PCR of eight of these 393 genes confirmed the microarray results. These 393 genes were involved in different processes and had different functions including defense, primary metabolism, transcription, and signal transduction etc. Some of these genes were elicited by various pathogen-related or stress stimuli, and others were regulated by plant growth regulators like auxin and gibberellin. These manifested complicated interactions of oligochitosan and phytohormones. An important jasmonic acid (JA) synthase (2-oxophytodienoate-10,11-reductase) gene, a JA-mediated defense required kinase ATMPK4-homolog gene, an ethylene receptor gene, and two ethylene responsive element binding protein (EREBP) genes were induced by oligochitosan, suggesting that oligochitosan activated the plant self-defense through JA/ET signaling pathway. © 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

33845515146	FTIR analysis of the enzymatic degradation of chitosan blend membranes	Chitosan blend membranes were prepared by casting the mixture solution of highly deacetylated chitosan(HDC) and moderately deacetylated chitosan(MDC). FTIR was used to investigate the components of the blend membranes before and after lysozymic degradation. It was found that the ratio of MDC in the blend membranes had a linear relation with the degree of deacetylation(DD) of the membranes. In enzymatic degradation process, DD of the membranes exhibited an increasing tendency. The FTIR data indicate that MDC component in the blend membranes can be removed by selective enzymatic degradation. This also suggests that FTIR can be used as an efficient and rapid method to investigate the degradation process of chitosan.

33845633921	Probing the role of microenvironment for microencapsulated Sacchromyces cerevisiae under osmotic stress	Cell encapsulation opens a new avenue to the oral delivery of genetically engineered microorganism for therapeutic purpose. Osmotic stress is one of the universal chemical stress factors in the application of microencapsulation technology. In order to understand the effect and mechanism of the encapsulated microenvironment on protecting cells from hyper-osmotic stress, yeast cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y800 were encapsulated in calcium alginate micro-gel beads (MB), alginate-chitosan-alginate (ACA) solid core microcapsules (SCM), and ACA liquid core microcapsules (LCM), respectively. The stress-induced intracellular components and enzyme activity including trehalose, glycerol and super oxide dismutase (SOD) were measured. Free cell culture was used as control. The survival of encapsulated cells and the cells released from MB, SCM and LCM after osmotic shock induced by NaCl solution (1, 2 and 3 M) was evaluated. An analysis method was established to probe the effect of encapsulated microenvironment on the cell tolerance to osmotic stress. The results showed that LCM gave rise to the highest level of intracellular trehalose and glycerol, and SOD activity, as well as the highest survival rate of encapsulated cells or cells released from microcapsule. It was demonstrated that LCM was able to induce the highest stress response and stress tolerance of cells, which was adapted during culture, while SCM failed. The theoretical analysis revealed that it was the liquid alginate matrix in microcapsule that played a central role in domesticating the cells to adapt to hyper-osmotic stress. This finding provides a very useful guideline to cell encapsulation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33846306719	Therapeutic effect of transplantation of microencapsulated human immortalized hepatocytes on acute liver failure in mice	Aim: To investigate the therapeutic effect of transplantation of microencapsulated human hepatocytes on acute liver failure in mice induced by carbon tetrachloride (CC14), so as to provide evidence for clinical application of microencapsulated heterogenous hepatocytes in transplantation. Methods: The experiment was conducted in the laboratory of Biomedial Material Engineering, Department of Biotechnology, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Science between February 2005 and January 2006. (1)Human hepatocytes were encapsulated in 400 μm of alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate microcapsules with the static electricity drip generator to establish the acute liver failure models, which had 10 times glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) than the normal values, by intraperitoneal injection of CC14. (2) Ninety successful mice models were selected and randomly divided into 3 groups: Empty capsule group injected with saline without cells; microencapsulated cell group intraperitoneally injected with microcapsules cell suspension and free cell group injected with free cell suspension, 1 mL per rat. (3)Ten mice in each group were randomly selected to observe the survival rate on the 8th day, and the rest mice were taken the retrobulbar venous plexus blood to measure the level of GOT and GPT on the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 8th days after transplantation, once 5 mice in each group. The microcapsules were retrieved for observation of their appearance, and the cells were performed tissue slice cytoactive observation. Results: The 90 mice models with acute liver failure were all involved in the result analysis. (1)The changes of GPT and GOT level at different time points after transplantation: On the 1st and 2nd days after transplantation, the level of two kinds of transaminase in the microencapsulated cells group was obviously lower than the other two groups (P < 0.05). On the 8th day, the level in each group was nearly the same (P > 0.05). (2)Comparison of survival rate of each group on the 8th day after transplantation: It was significantly higher in the microencapsulated cells group than the other two groups (90.0%, 50.0% and 60.0%, P < 0.05). (3) The observed results on appearance and cytoactive of the microcapsules: The retrieved microcapsules had complete and smooth appearance, without obvious fibrous encapsulation, and the cells were round, the cell membrane was silky and complete with full cytoplasm, more than 90% of the hepatocytes remained survival. Conclusion: Microencapsulated hepatocytes transplantation can increase the survival rate of mice with CC14-induced acute liver failure, and improve the liver biochemical function, indicating that the microcapsule can effectively inhibit immunologic rejection and protect the transplanted hepatocytes to display its biological function.

33846008413	Microcalorimetric study on the growth and metabolism of microencapsulated microbial cell culture	The rate of heat output is one of the suitable measurements of metabolic activity of the organism or its parts, down to the cellular or even the sub-cellular levels. In this paper, microcalorimetry was first applied to study the metabolic activity of microbial in both alginate-polylysine-alginate and alginate-chitosan-alginate microencapsulated cultures as well as in free non-encapsulated culture. The organisms used for the measurements were Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As a result of this work, it was found that, despite E. coli cell in free non-encapsulated culture has the highest metabolic rate due to the highest value of heat output, the proliferation of the cells terminates quickly with a lowest biomass formed. And we found also an obviously longer stationary phase in microencapsulated culture. As far as S. cerevisiae was concerned, it was found that there was also the highest value of heat output in free non-encapsulated culture, but the cell density was lower than that in microencapsulated culture. On account of the microcalorimetric and metabolic measurements, it can be concluded that more substrate can be used to convert to biomass in microencapsulated culture which means a higher biomass yield existed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In order to evaluate the measurement uncertainty, the rotary precision of air bearing was tested and the error curve of the spindle was obtained with the least square roundness error of about 48 nm. The noise in AFM measurement process was tested after the shafting was assembled. The amplitude of static noise dropped to about 10 nm though structural modification. The system was utilized in the measurement of circular traces on the target surface, which got the noise amplitude of about 13 nm and the composite measure error of about 49.7 nm during the running process. In addition, the accuracy of the system can be further improved by error separation technique.

33947366001	Tumor anti-angiogenic gene therapy with microencapsulated recombinant CHO cells	Microencapsulation of recombinant cells is a novel promising approach to tumor therapy in which therapeutic protein is sustainable and long-term delivered by microencapsulated cells. The semi-permeable membrane of microcapsule can protect cell from host's immune rejection, increase the chemical stability of therapeutic protein and circumvent the problems of toxicity, limited half-lives and variation in circulating levels. Endostatin, a potent and specific angiogenesis inhibitor, could suppress the growth of primary and metastatic lesions in multiple murine tumor models. In this paper, APA microcapsules with high strength kept intact over 35 days and recombinant CHO cells kept the rapid proliferation viability and the continuous endostatin-expression function. The study of tumor treatment showed that the implantation of microencapsulated recombinant CHO cells decreased the neovascularization of tumor tissue by 59.4% and inhibited the B16 melanoma growth by 77.4%. Twenty days after tumor cell injection, 80% of animals treated with microencapsulated CHO-endo cells were alive compared to only 50% of animals in either control or mock control groups. Therefore, continuous delivery of endostatin from microencapsulated recombinant cells represents a feasible approach to tumor therapy. © Biomedical Engineering Society 2007.

34247188017	Inhibition of tumor growth in mice by endostatin derived from abdominal transplanted encapsulated cells	Endostatin, a C-terminal fragment of collagen 18a, inhibits the growth of established tumors and metastases in vivo by inhibiting angiogenesis. However, the purification procedures required for large-scale production and the attendant cost of these processes, together with the low effectiveness in clinical tests, suggest that alternative delivery methods might be required for efficient therapeutic use of endostatin. In the present study, we transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with a human endostatin gene expression vector and encapsulated the CHO cells in alginate-poly-L-lysine microcapsules. The release of biologically active endostatin was confirmed using the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay. The encapsulated endostatin-expressing CHO cells can inhibit the growth of primary tumors in a subcutaneous B16 tumor model when injected into the abdominal cavity of mouse. These results widen the clinical application of the microencapsulated cell endostatin delivery system in cancer treatment. © 2007 Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBS, CAS.

Methods: The experiment was done in Laboratory of Biomedical Material Engineering, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics in the Chinese Academy of Science between July and December in 2006. The mucoadhesive property of chitosan was evaluated by studying interaction between chitosan and mucin in solution with UV spectrophotometry. 1The pH value of medium was adjusted (1.0, 3.0 and 5.0) to study the influence of pH to mucoadhesive property of chitosan. 2The temperature of medium was adjusted (4, 25 and 37 °C) to study the influence of temperature on mucoadhesive property of chitosan. 3The influence of molecular weight (MW) of chitosan (48 000, 124 000 and 230 000) to its mucoadhesive property was studied. 4The influence of deactylation degree (DD) of chitosan (56%, 67% and 97%) was studied likewise. 5Different types of mucin were used to study the influence of sialic acid concentration to mucoadhesive property of chitosan. Results: 1The interaction between chitosan and mucin was enhanced as the pH value of medium increased from 1.2 to 5.0. 2The mucoadhesive property of chitosan increased with an increasing of temperature. 3The influence of chitosan's MW to mucoadhesion was not significant; 4With an increasing DD of chitosan, the interaction between chitosan and mucin was enhanced significantly; 5A greater interaction with chitosan was found with a high sialic content of the mucin (type I-S). Conclusion: The pH value, temperature, charge density of chitosan and mucin significantly affect the interaction between chitosan and mucin, which can be enhanced by increasing pH value of medium, temperature, DD of chitosan and sialic acid concentration of mucin.

37549049810	Optimization of microencapsulated recombinant CHO cell growth, endostatin production, and stability of microcapsule in vivo	Microencapsulation of recombinant cells secreting endostatin offers a promising approach to tumor gene therapy in which therapeutic protein is delivered in a sustainable and long-term fashion by encapsulated recombinant cells. However, the studies of cell growth and protein production in vivo are very limited. In this study, the effects of microencapsulation parameters on in vivo cell growth, endostatin production, and microcapsule stability after implantation in the peritoneal cavity of mice were for the first time investigated. Microcapsules with liquid core reached higher cell density and endostatin production at day 18 than microcapsules with solid core. There was no significant difference in stability whether the core of the microcapsule was solid or liquid. Decrease in microcapsule size increased the stability of microcapsule. The microcapsules kept intact in the peritoneal cavity of mice after 36 days of implantation when the microcapsules size was 240 μm in diameter, which gave rise to high endostatin production as well. The optimized microencapsulation conditions for in vivo implantation are liquid core and 240 μm in diameter. This study provides useful information for antiangiogenic gene therapy to tumors using microencapsulated recombinant cells. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

34249822255	In vivo culture of encapsulated endostatin-secreting Chinese hamster ovary cells for systemic tumor inhibition	Microencapsulation of recombinant cells is a novel alternative approach to tumor gene therapy. Therapeutic protein delivery can be sustained for systemic treatment of tumors because the recombinant cells are enclosed in microcapsules and the semipermeable membrane of the microcapsules protects the cells from host immune rejection and reduces the need for frequent injection. In this study, we describe a method to systemically inhibit tumor growth by in vivo culture of antiangiogenic endostatin-secreting Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in microcapsules as small as 200 μm in diameter. Peritoneal administration of encapsulated endostatin-CHO cells inhibited melanoma growth to 66.4% and enhanced the survival of treated mice to 80% by 27 days posttreatment. Continuous systemic release of endostatin from microcapsules offers an effective therapeutic strategy to eradicate solid tumors. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

77954626100	Treatment of acute hepatic failure in mice by transplantation of mixed microencapsulation of rat hepatocytes and transgenic human fetal liver stromal cells	Microencapsulation-mediated cell therapy overcomes the immune incompatibility between donor and recipient in transplantation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of transplantation of microcapsules containing a mixture of rat hepatocytes and human fetal liver stromal cells (hFLSCs), engineered to produce basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), on acute liver failure (ALF) in mice. In vitro experiments showed that different combinations of microencapsulated rat's hepatocytes and stromal cells survive, grow, and function better in three-dimensional conditions. The metabolic activity of rat hepatocytes co-microencapsulated with hFLSCs, particularly when engineered to produce bFGF (FLSCs/bFGF), is significantly higher than that of microcapsules with rat hepatocytes alone. Intraperitoneal transplantation of the encapsulated hepatocytes with FLSCs/bFGF increased the survival rate and improved liver function of an ALF mouse model induced by a 70% partial hepatectomy in BALB/C mice. Moreover, dramatic liver regeneration was observed 2 days after transplantation in the group that received intraperitoneal transplantations of encapsulated hepatocytes with FLSCs/bFGF. Therefore, transplantation of encapsulated hepatocytes and hFLSCs/bFGF may be a promising strategy to treat ALF or related liver diseases. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

79952320229	Fabrication and half-life time of gas-filled plastic hohlraum	This paper focuses on the fabrication and half-life time of the gas-filled polystyrene hohlraum. There are two ways to fabricate the polystyrene hohlraum, i.e. spin coating with polystyrene solution and dip coating with molten polystyrene. Experiments show that many bubbles and orientation crystallization exist in the plastic hohlraum made by polystyrene melt, and the hohlraum can hardly retain gas due to too many cracks in it after the removal of copper mandrels. Plastic hohlraums made by spin coating, 10 to 30 μm in thickness and 5 to 20 nm in surface finish, are sealed with 0.3~0.4 μm thick polyimide films. The half-life time of these hohlraums filled with kropton gas is more than 24 h measured by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. Held in a gas container, the gas can keep about 92% of the initial density inside the target just before shotting.

The compound probe is employed and the measurement mathematical model is established. An improved genetic algorithm is applied to solve the unknown parameters of the model. Hence, by means of this model, the 3D surface data of the tested object can be transformed into the same reference coordinate system. Quasi-Newton method is introduced and in charge of processing tested surface data. Based on the variety of tested object, such as plane, sphere, cylinder etc. the corresponding optimization objective function and initial condition are set properly to achieve the solution of characteristic parameters. Especially, in this work, an evaluation function method based on the "roundness" information of the through-hole image is proposed to detect the diameter and spatial location of hole, which particularly fits for inspecting those thin and small through-holes drilled at the soft and easy-deformed objects. Consequently, the measurement puzzle of spatial angle between two thin and through-holes is easily solved. The experiments show that the measurement repeatability of this machine is within 1.6 μm. Meanwhile, the experiments illustrate the validity and feasibility for through-holes measurement. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84876826755	Microcapsule co-culture system enhances neural differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells	Cell co-culture plays a key role in inducing the committed differentiation of stem cells in vitro, which mimics the specific tissue microenvironment in vivo by means of co-cultured inducing cells. However, the present cell co-culture systems limit the application of differentiated cells due to the safety and the scale of these systems. This study established a novel microcapsule co-culture system and investigated the probable effect of microencapsulated co-cultured neural cells on neural differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) ex vivo. Mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs were co-cultured with SHSY5Y cells microencapsulated in alginatepolylysine-alginate (APA) microcapsules. The quantitative and qualitative analysis showed that the expression of Nestin (Nes) was significantly increased at both gene and protein levels in the microcapsule co-culture system compared with other systems without cell co-culture, which indicated that more neural progenitors were obtained from this novel microcapsule co-culture system. According to our results and the unique characteristics of microcapsules, it is possible that large-scale cell co-culture system based on the combination of microcapsule and bioreactor technologies will be developed to generate numerous MSCs-derived neural progenitors for clinical applications in the future. © 2013 The Hard Tissue Biology Network Association Printed in Japan, All rights reserved.

84897520788	The effect of resveratrol on the expression of AdipoR1 in kidneys of diabetic nephropathy	Adiponectin is an adipocyte derived protein that plays pivotal roles in anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties by activating two receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. Recent studies have shown that the down-regulation of AdipoR1 is a known cause of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Resveratrol (Resv), a natural polyphenol, has been identified as a potent activator of forkhead transcription factor O1 (FoxO1) which can up-regulate the expression of AdipoR1. In the present study, we have investigated whether Resv can up-regulate the expression of AdipoR1 by activating FoxO1 that is in kidney of DN rats and mesangial cells (MCs) cultured in high glucose (HG, 30 mmol/L) medium. In vivo, we show that, in the renal cortex of diabetic rats, the expression of AdipoR1 was significantly reduced and correlated with an increase in the generation of malondialdehyde (MDA), Collagen IV and fibronectin proteins. However, administration with Resv significantly increased the expression of AdipoR1. This correlated with not only a decrease in generation of MDA, Collagen IV and fibronectin proteins levels but also more improved kidney pathological and biochemical indicators changes. In vitro, we show that HG-induced depression of FoxO1 activity was associated with the expression of Adipor1 in MCs. Treatment with Resv (20 μmol/L) caused an elevation in the activity of FoxO1 and a significantly increase in the expression of AdipoR1. Furthermore, inhibition of FoxO1 through short hairpin RNA markedly reduced the expression of Adipor1 in MCs cultured by Resv. In conclusion, Resv can significantly increase the expression of AdipoR1 by activating FoxO1 in diabetic kidney. These data also suggest that Resv may serve as a promising agent for preventing or treating DN. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Nuclear fuel pressure is an essential parameter for estimating fusion efficiency in ICF experiments. This parameter is difficult to determine because of complicated target structures, short measurement time, relatively short optical path length changes, and expansion of the target after pressurization.

In this work, the optimized amino acid supplements and several chemically defined compounds were applied to cultivation of the microencapsulated CHO cells. The results show that the optimized medium significantly enhances cell survival and, particularly, endostatin secretion of encapsulated CHO cells over a time period of 8 weeks. Furthermore, long-term in vitro stability of alginate-poly-l-lysine-alginate (APA) microcapsules underwent no changes, which indicated that this optimized medium might be feasible to maintain high viability of microencapsulated cell for short periods of time before implantation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

41849110869	Study on homogeneity of enzymatic degradation of chitosan as biomaterials by gel permeation chromatography	Chitosan is an important biomedical material, and its degree of deacetylation is a main parameter of its biodegradation. Gel permeation chromatography was used to investigate the lysozymic degradation of two types of chitosan samples (A and B) with similar degree of deacetylation and relative molecular mass but with different distributions of two units of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucosamine. Weight average relative molecular mass, polydispersity and gel permeation chromatograms during the degradation process were obtained. It was found that chitosan sample A with random distribution of the two units underwent a homogeneous degradation process while chitosan sample B with block distribution underwent a heterogeneous degradation process. The results suggest that the homogeneity of the degradation of chitosan materials by lysozyme depends on the distribution type of the two units, which can help to design chitosan-based biomedical devices.

43249105353	Interior surface roughness of ICF micro-shells with phase shift interference technique	Phase-shifting interference (PSI) is an important method in surface roughness measurement. In this paper, on the basis of analyzing phase distribution of micro-shell interface, the measuring principle of interior surface roughness of micro-shells is discussed. Inner surface images of PS and PAMS micro-shells were obtained with PSI method. The results are consistent with the measured results by atomic force microscope. The measurement error is analyzed by studying the influence of thickness fluctuation of micro-shell and outer surface roughness of micro-shell on measured results of SiC and crystal Si surface roughness. The experimental result shows that the measuring uncertainty is under 0.4 nm for micro-shells with 30 nm outer surface roughness and 9 μm thickness.

46949107510	Optimization of seeding density in microencapsulated recombinant CHO cell culture	Microencapsulation technology is an alternative large-scale mammalian cell culture method. The semi-permeable membrane of the microcapsule allows free diffusion of nutrients, oxygen and toxic metabolites to support cell growth, and the microcapsule membrane can protect the cells from the mechanical damage of shear forces associated with agitation and aeration. Many polymers have been used to make microcapsules, such as chitosan, polyacrylates, alginate, polyamino acids, and polyamides. One of these microcapsules is Alginate-polylysine- alginate (APA) microcapsule. Using the electrostatic droplet generator and polyelectrolyte complexation, we developed APA microcapsules with a diameter of 300 μm and assessed the effect of the seeding density on microencapsulated recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell growth, metabolism and endostatin production. The results showed that the cell growth was the best and endostatin production was the highest when the seeding density was 3 · 10

47149098240	In Vitro and in Vivo characterization of alginate-chitosan-alginate artificial microcapsules for therapeutic oral delivery of live bacterial cells	Oral administration of artificial cell microcapsules entrapping live bacterial cells is a promising approach in disease therapy. However, the current technology of microcapsules limits this approach. In this study, alginate-chitosan-alginate (ACA) microcapsules entrapping live bacterial cells were prepared with the purpose of oral delivery for therapy, and their in vitro and in vivo properties were investigated. Genetically engineered Escherichia coli DH5 were used as the model bacterial strain. ACA microcapsules remained intact and stable in simulated gastrointestinal fluid and the entrapped bacteria cells survived and grew normally. Moreover, ACA microcapsules were more stable than alginate-polylysine-alginate microcapsules in the rat gastrointestinal tract, which was attributed to the enhanced resistance of the ACA microcapsules to enzymatic digestion. Therefore, these results reinforce the potential of ACA microcapsules for the therapeutic oral delivery of live bacterial cells. © 2008 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

The difference between bounces on a mesh pan and a glass pan is evaluated. The capability of mesh pans for bouncing PAMS microspheres is examined. The effect of the related parameters of the mesh pans on the surface roughness of the microshells has been explored. The experimental results show that the mesh pans improve significantly the bounce of PAMS microspheres in comparison with glass pans. In order to improve the surface roughness of microspheres, an intermittent vibration mode must be applied on the mesh pans for bouncing the microsphere.

The influence of bounce modes on the surface topography of the CH coating was discussed. The surface topography was probed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Roughness and sphericity were measured with an atomic force microscopy (AFM). X-radiography was used to obtain the concentricity. The results show that the surface topography of the coating is improved significantly by the intermittent bounce mode, and the roughness of medium high mode is reduced. The surface finish is improved ulteriorly by the intermittent bounce mode as the duty ratio is reduced. The RMS roughness of 30 μm CH coating is less than 30 nm. The spericity and concentricity of hydrocarbon-polystyrene (CH-PS) microshell are all better than 99% when the duty ratio is 1/4.

The relationship between the defects on micro-shell surface and power spectrum was analyzed theoretically and simulated. The results show that the root mean square roughness (RMS) of power spectrum increased with the increases of height and the rand noise, and decreased with the decrease of daimeter of defects. At the same time, the effect of defect's height on power spectrum was more serious than that of defect's diameter. And the RMS of power spectrum increased with the increase of defect's quantity, and resulted in some periodic characteristic in power spectrum curve.

This study investigated the characteristics and biodegradation of chitosan-alginate PECs prepared by freeze-drying a precipitate from sufficient mixtures of the two polymers. The analyses of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) suggested that the partial protonated amine groups of chitosan reacted with the carboxylate groups of alginate and thus strong PECs were formed. After incubating in lysozyme solution, the PECs showed high ability of enzyme adsorption, and low degradation rate in spite of different degrees of deacetylation of chitosan, due to the strong interaction between chitosan and alginate and the hindrance of closely adsorbed lysozyme. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Although an alternative novel emulsification-internal gelation technology has been established and both the properties and the potential applications of the beads in drug delivery systems have been studied, the mechanism has not been well understood compared with the traditional droplet method (external gelation technology). On the basis of our previous knowledge that the novel technology is composed of complicatedly consecutive processes with multistep diffusion and reaction, and the diffusion of acetic acid across oil/water interface being the prerequisite that determines the occurrence and rate for the reactions and the structures and properties of final produced gel beads, a special emphasis was placed on the diffusion process.

59949101528	Large-scale preparation of calcium alginate gel beads in high voltage electrostatic field	In this paper, calcium alginate gel beads were prepared through a homemade microcapsule preparation system with multi-nozzles under forced high-voltage electrostatic field. The effect of operation parameters on the large-scale preparation of gel beads was analyzed. The results showed that the air pressure of feed was the decisive factor affecting the size and yield of gel beads, and the size distribution was dependent on several factors including the distribution of electric field, pulse potential, air pressure of feed, pulse frequency, pulse width and threshold potential. The gel beads with good sphericity, smooth surface and low dispersivity (CV<20%) can be prepared by adjusting and optimizing above parameters. It is more important that the yield of gel beads by the microcapsule preparation system is 20-40 folds higher than the traditional electrostatic droplet generator, which makes it possible to realize the large-scale preparation of gel beads.

In this paper, the idea of preparing immobilization carrier of microbes using the emulsification-internal gelation technology was put forward with S. cerevisiae BY4741 (yeast cells) as a model. The influence of process parameters on the survival rate of microbes was firstly evaluated, which showed that acetic acid was harmful to yeast cells. Based on the mechanism analysis of internal gelation, the process parameters were adjusted and improved to benefit the survival and growth of microbes. As a result, the survival rate of yeast cells could reach 77.0%, and the volumetric yield rate of gel beads was 93.5%. Furthermore, alginate-chitosan (AC) microcapsules entrapping yeast cells were prepared, and the growth kinetics of AC microencapsulated yeast cells was investigated. The results showed that AC microcapsules kept intact with the immobilized culture process, and the growth kinetics of AC microencapsulated cells was better than that of free culture. Therefore, the emulsification-internal gelation technology is expected to be used for the scale-up production of high-value drugs or fine chemicals with immobilized culture of microbes.

65349168311	Adsorption behavior of fibrinogen onto alginate-chitosan-alginate microcapsules	Alginate-chitosan-alginate (ACA) microcapsules have been widely studied as devices for the immuno-isolation and transplantation of living cells. However, long-term survival of the micro-encapsulated cell grafts and thus their potential clinical applications are hampered by the pericapsular fibrotic overgrowth induced by adsorbed protein. In this study, the adsorption behavior of plasma fibrinogen (Fgn) onto ACA microcapsules was studied by using the batch technique. The results showed that the equilibrium time for the adsorption was 24 h. The adsorption of Fgn onto ACA microcapsules fitted very well with Freundlich isotherm, which was indicative of multilayer adsorption. The kinetic experimental data correlated well with the second-order kinetic model, indicating that chemical sorption was the rate-limiting step. The effects of pH and ionic strength on the adsorption were also studied to interpret the mechanism of adsorption. It was found that the amount of adsorbed Fgn decreased with increasing pH in the range of 4.9-7.4. At pH 7.4, the amount of adsorbed Fgn increased with increasing NaCl concentration, and then decreased with further increase in NaCl concentration. At pH 6.0, the amount of adsorbed Fgn decreased with increasing NaCl concentration, indicating that electrostatic interaction was one of the main interactions between Fgn and ACA microcapsules and the positively charged chitosans which was not sufficiently neutralized on the surface of microcapsules induced the adsorption. © All Rights Reserved.

67649214742	Quantitative analysis of the concentration of Br-doping in micro-shell coating with XRF	In inertial confinement fusion (ICF) physics experiment, the micro-shell that contains Br-doped CH coating must be characterized for doping Br concentration level. X-ray fluorescence (XRF), with its unique capability to quantitatively determine concentrations of most elements simultaneously and non-destructively, is generally the method of choice for total dopant (Z>11) concentration. In the present paper, a method to determine the dopant concentration in ICF micro-shell coating with X-ray fluorescence spectrometry is described, and the calibration model is founded by the calculation of fluorescence intensity of film and micro-shell sample. Based on the calibration model, the fluorescence intensity vs concentration of Br-doped CH coating of micro-shell was obtained. The experiment result shows that X-ray fluorescence spectrometry is a nondestructive and accurate method of measurement of coating dopant in the inertial confinement fusion micro-shell sample, and the measuring error is about 5% for Br doped CH coating of micro-shells with 10 micron thickness coating.

The changes of the yeast cells' specific growth rate, maximum product quantity and the secretion of ethanol and glycerol were analyzed. For Y02724, the yield of ethanol was increased in the ACA microenvironment compared to suspension cultivation. For Hansel, the maximum growth speed of microencapsulated cultivation had no obvious difference compared to the suspension cultivation. Moreover, after encapsulation, the production of glycerol was decreased for both Y02724 and Hansel compared to suspension cultivation. In conclusion, osmotic stress existed in the ACA microcapsules and affected the growth and metabolism of the cells. © 2008 Institute of Microbiology, CAS & CSM, All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using the technique of micro-encapsulation to study the differentiation and function of UCB cells in an injured liver model and the potential of encapsulated UCB cells for use in the reversal of hepatic injury. Methods UCB cells were isolated from fresh human UCB, encapsulated using the alginate-poly-lysine-alginate method and transplanted intraperitoneally into liver-injured mice induced by CCl4. Encapsulated UCB cell growth, viability and differentiation in vivo were detected. For evaluating the recovery of injured liver tissues, serum aminotransferases and liver histology were assessed. Results Encapsulated UCB cells showed better growth behavior after being implanted. Under conditions favoring differentiation in vivo, the expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin (ALB) and urea synthesis were detected in a time-dependent manner. Serum amino-transferases were decreased after transplantation of encapsulated UCB cells into injured mice, and damage to the histologic structure of the liver was reduced. Conclusions The cell microencapsulation system provides a novel approach for learning more about the differentiation and function of UCB cells in vivo. Transplantation of encapsulated UCB cells can enhance recovery of CCl4-injured mouse liver. These observations suggest potential as an alternative to hepatocyte transplantation for cellular therapy of liver failure. © 2009 ISCT.

77349091857	Effect of surface wettability and charge on protein adsorption onto implantable alginate-chitosan-alginate microcapsule surfaces	Alginate-chitosan-alginate (ACA) microcapsules have been developed as a device for the transplantation of living cells. However, protein adsorption onto the surface of microcapsules immediately upon their implantation decides their ultimate biocompatibility. In this work, the chemical composition of the ACA membranes was determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The surface wettability and charge were determined by contact angle and zeta potential measurements, respectively. Then, the effects of surface wettability and charge on bovine fibrinogen (Fgn) and gamma globulin (IgG) adsorption onto ACA microcapsules were evaluated. The results showed that ACA microcapsules had a hydrophilic membrane. So, the surface wettability of ACA microcapsules had little effect on protein adsorption. There was a negative zeta potential of ACA microcapsules which varies with the viscosity or G content of alginate used, indicating a varying degree of net negatively charged groups on the surface of ACA microcapsules. The amount of adsorbed protein increased with increasing of positive charge. Furthermore, the interaction between proteins and ACA microcapsules is dominated by electrostatic repulsion at pH 7.4 and that is of electrostatic attraction at pH 6.0. This work could help to explain the bioincompatibility of ACA microcapsules and will play an important role in the optimization of the microcapsule design. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A novel soft tissue bulking agent composed of calcium alginate microspheres was prepared by electrostatic droplet method, following the purification of alginate. A 4-week subcutaneous mouse model was used to determine the resorption of the material in vivo and the preliminary mechanism of the resorption was discussed. The experimental results indicated that the calcium alginate microspheres played a key role in the bulking agent to resist the resorption and the degree of the resorption varied with the average diameter of microspheres in bulking agents. In addition, the purification of alginate has no distinctive influence on the resorption. The implanted microspheres were retrieved from the subcutaneous intactly. Histologically, the implants showed biocompatibility in vivo. It is demonstrated that the calcium alginate microspheres have the potential of tissue-engineering bulking agents for soft tissue augmentation.

In this study, a new method termed "hydro-spinning" was developed to make alginate/chitosan hybrid fibers. In hydro-spinning, a chitosan solution was pumped into a flowing sodium alginate solution and sheared into streamlines. These elongated streamlines subsequently transformed into alginate/chitosan PEC ribbon-like fibers before breaking up into pieces. Average diameter and chitosan content of the fibers correlated positively with the chitosan concentration used in spinning. These hybrid fibers showed a high water-absorbability of around 50-fold to 60-fold of water to their dry weight and could retain their integrity after saturation in minimum essential medium (MEM) medium for 30 days. In vitro culture experiments demonstrated that these fibers were able to support the three-dimensional growth of MCF-7, suggesting the potential applications of these fibers in biomedical and bioengineering fields such as tissue engineering. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

77950935046	Effect of surface morphology and charge on the amount and conformation of fibrinogen adsorbed onto alginate/chitosan microcapsules	We report the influence of surface morphology and charge of alginate/chitosan (ACA) microcapsules on both the amount of adsorbed protein and its secondary structural changes during adsorption. Variations in surface morphology and charge were controlled by varying alginate molecular weight and chitosan concentration. Plasma fibrinogen (Fgn) was chosen to model this adsorption to foreign surfaces. The surface of ACA microcapsules exhibited a granular structure after incubating calcium alginate beads with chitosan solution to form membranes. The surface roughness of ACA microcapsule membranes decreased with decreasing alginate molecular weight and chitosan concentration. Zeta potential measurements showed that there was a net negative charge on the surface of ACA microcapsules which decreased with decreasing alginate molecular weight and chitosan concentration. The increase in both surface roughness and zeta potential resulted in an increase in the amount of Fgn adsorbed. Moreover, the higher the zeta potential was, the stronger the protein?surface interaction between fibrinogen and ACA microcapsules was. More protein molecules adsorbed spread and had a greater conformational change on rougher surfaces for more surfaces being available for protein to attach. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

It is necessary to prepare a plenty of the microcapsules with better cell viability and higher endostatin production in order to bring this technology into the clinic. The in vitro culture and cryopreservation are very important parameters in the preparation of microencapsulated cells. In this work, we studied the effect of the in vitro culture and cryopreservation on microencapsulated recombinant cells growth and endostatin production and the effect of the in vitro culture on the cryopreservation of microencapsulated recombinant cells. The results showed that the time of in vitro culture potently affected microencapsulated recombinant CHO cells growth in vivo, endostatin production and the microcapsule stability. The microcapsule kept intact after 36 days of implantation when the in vitro culture time was under 4 days. The thawed microencapsulated recombinant CHO cells had better cell growth and higher endostatin production after 40 days of cryopreservation when the in vitro culture time was 4 days and 8 days. Therefore, the best in vitro culture time was 4 days according to the results of the in vivo culture and cryopreservation and the cryopreservation did not affect microencapsulated recombinant CHO cells growth in vivo, endostatin production and the microcapsule stability.

However, in the absence of a vascular network, cells in the core of large-sized spheroids are gradually necrotic because of oxygen transfer limitations. In this study, a novel APA microcapsule embedded with three-dimensional fibrous scaffolds (called APA-FS) was proposed to eliminate cellular necrosis by regulating cells to form multi-small spheroids. HepG2 cells were embedded within the APA-FS to form spheroids and the state of these spheroids was evaluated via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide assay, glucose/lactate metabolism, live/dead staining, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Comparing with the conventional APA microcapsules, the cells within APA-FS organized into multi-small spheroids. The size of these spheroids depended on the concentration of fibrous scaffolds embedded within the microcapsules. In the APA-FS embedded with 5% (v/v) fibrous scaffolds, the average size of cellular spheroids was controlled below 100μm and the cellular viability was increased by 50% than the control. The results of live/dead staining and hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the improved cellular viability might be attributed to the decreased necrosis in the core of these spheroids. The improved viability of cells demonstrated the efficiency of this technology. These findings implied that this system might provide a more suitable culture environment for a variety of tissue engineering applications. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

77958107565	Monitoring of cell viability and proliferation in hydrogel-encapsulated system by resazurin assay	Cell microencapsulation is a promising approach for cell implantation, cell-based gene therapy and large-scale cell culture. For better quality control, it is important to accurately measure the microencapsulated cell viability and proliferation in the culture. A number of assays have been used for this purpose, but limitations arise. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and reliability of resazurin as a cell growth indicator in microencapsulated culture system. According to the experiment data, there was a reversible, time- and dose-dependent growth inhibition as observed for resazurin application in encapsulated cells. A positive relationship was observed between reduction of resazurin and CHO cell number in microcapsule. Moreover, the resazurin assay provided an equivalent result to the commonly used MTT method in determining CHO cell proliferation in APA microcapsule with no notable influence on cell distribution and organization pattern. In conclusion, resazurin assay is offered as a simple, rapid and non-invasive method for in vitro microencapsulated cell viability and proliferation measurement. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

78650294585	Synthesis and characterization of amphiphilic glycidol-chitosan-deoxycholic acid nanoparticles as a drug carrier for doxorubicin	Novel amphiphilic chitosan derivatives (glycidol-chitosan-deoxycholic acid, G-CS-DCA) were synthesized by grafting hydrophobic moieties, deoxycholic acid (DCA), and hydrophilic moieties, glycidol, with the purpose of preparing carriers for poorly soluble drugs. Based on self-assembly, G-CS-DCA can form nanoparticles with size ranging from 160 to 210 nm, and G-CS-DCA nanoparticles maintained stable structure for about 3 months when stored in PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature. The critical aggregation concentration decreased from 0.043 mg/mL to 0.013 mg/mL with the increase of degree of substitution (DS) of DCA. Doxorubicin (DOX) could be easily encapsulated into G-CS-DCA nanoparticles and keep a sustained release manner without burst release when exposed to PBS (pH 7.4) at 37°C. Antitumor efficacy results showed that DOX-G-CS-DCA have significant antitumor activity when MCF-7 cells were incubated with different concentration of DOX-G-CS-DCA nanoparticles. The fluorescence imaging results indicated DOX-G-CS-DCA nanoparticles could easily be uptaken by MCF-7 cells. These results suggested that G-CS-DCA nanoparticles may be a promising carrier for DOX delivery in cancer therapy. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

In order to determine the center and radius of the microsphere accurately, the least square fitting expressions with some characteristic points on the shell edge is deduced. For shell image edges of different types (step-shaped or roof-like), the average second-order derivative algorithm or the least square Lorentz fitting peak-finding algorithm of radial absorption intensity is used to obtain the ICF shells' circumferential edge data with a sub-pixel accuracy. The power spectra curve as a function of the mode number of outer or inner profiles are also calculated by the application of fast Fourier transform to the circumferential profile data.

The measurement principle and system structure were descripted in detail, and the measurement uncertainty was analyzed. The thickness and thickness distribution of the self-supporting metal film with the thickness between 10-100 μm were tested using the sensor group, precise displacement platform and precise calibrated samples. The measurement uncertainty was evaluated based on analysis of sensor accuracy, the uncertainty of calibration sample thickness, the positioning accuracy of two sensors and the system repetition uncertainty. Experimental results indicate that the measurement uncertainty is about 0.12 μm, which satisfies the requirements of Inertial Confinement Fusion(ICF) for target parameter measurement in high stabilization, high precision and non-destruction.

79956315311	Effect of chitosan deacetylation degree on surface properties and fibrinogen adsorption of alginate/chitosan microcapsules	The surface charge, wettability and roughness of ACA microcapsule membranes were firstly analyzed by streaming potential, contact angle and surface profile measurement. The effect of surface properties on the amount and conformation of fibrinogen adsorbed onto ACA microcapsules was then studied. The results show that there is a negative Zeta potential of ACA microcapsules which decrease with decreasing in chitosan deacetylation degree, indicating less positively charged groups on the surface. The surface wettability of ACA membranes made of chitosans with degree of deacetylation range from 60% to 90% has no statistical difference. ACA membranes have a granular structure surface. The surface roughness decreases with decreasing in chitosan deacetylation degree. Fibrinogen molecules are arranged on the surface of ACA microcapsules in a mixture of side-on and end-on configurations. With the decreasing in deacetylation degree of chitosan, the amount of protein adsorbed decreases, and more fibrinogen molecules adsorbed are in end-on configuration in this case. The results indicate that the surface properties of ACA microcapsules made of chitosans with different deacetylation degree have great effect on the amount and configuration of fibrinogen adsorbed.

79957577510	Application of compound measuring method with laser and CCD to sphericity error detection of ICF target	A novel compound measuring method for sphericity error detection of ICF target is proposed. Combining the advantages of laser probe and CCD camera, this method can effectively integrate the data captured by laser probe and CCD camera into the same coordinate system by means of calibrating the position relationship of the two optical axes with a standard ball. The quasi-Newton method is employed to process the measured data with the noise data eliminated. Meanwhile, the diameter of target derived by CCD camera is used as partial initial conditions, which prevents the occurrence of local optimization due to inappropriate initial parameter selection. The experiment has been carried out on the experiment platform of a compact five-coordinate measuring machine under two kinds of measuring mode, demonstrating the validity and robustness of this method.

79958068760	Study on membrane characteristics of alginate-chitosan microcapsule with cell growth	Alginate-chitosan (AC) microcapsule with polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) membrane has been attractive in biotechnological area such as cell immobilization fermentation. The PEC membrane has been known important to control microcapsule performance, but the knowledge was mainly obtained with empty or drug-loaded microcapsules. In this paper, the emphasis was to explore the influence of cell growth on PEC membrane characteristics, that is, to study the membrane characteristics in dynamic process. AC microcapsule entrapping yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741) was used as model, and the PEC membrane characteristics including membrane thickness, swelling behavior, permeability, and component were studied during cell culture process. It was found that both the membrane thickness and volume swelling degree of AC microcapsule increased, however, membrane permeability decreased with the growth of entrapped yeast cells. Fluorescence-labeling studies suggested the concentrated alginate layer squeezed by the proliferated cells and macromolecular metabolites layer secreted by proliferated cells contributed to above increment. The former PEC membrane, together with the new layers, constituted the 'apparent membrane', which increased the diffusion resistance of substances. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79958185822	Installation error calibration of laser probe for miniature five-coordinate measuring machine	According to the practical measuring requirement, a non-contact five-coordinate measuring machine is exploited and developed. Considering that the installation error of laser probe is large and difficult to be adjusted, the installation error model of this machine is established. The unconstrained optimization objective function of error model is derived by measuring the spatial location of physical standard under several specific postures of laser probe. An improved genetic algorithm is introduced to solve the unknown optimal parameters. The calculation for Euclidean distance is used to evaluate the similarity between each individual. Those individuals between which similarity is greater than a given threshold will be eliminated from the population, to avoid the occurrence of prematurity for genetic algorithm. The experiments illustrate that the established error model is applicable for the scanning probe, as well as the touch-trigger probe, and the spatial measuring precision of this machine is enhanced from 11.82+L/1000 μm to1.96+L/1000 μm.

The optimal microencapsulation conditions has been investigated and the morphology of the microcapsules has been observed by Optical microscope. The results show that the optimized microencapsulation condition is core-wall ratio 2 g/g , DS 0.050, coacervating agent 0.8 mL/mL emulsion, with the cross-linker 0.04 g/g SSOS, stirring speed 700 rpm for emulsification, and 350 rpm for coacervation. Meanwhile, the protective effect experiments via aeration method indicate that the increment of peroxide value (POV) of entrapped EPO is only 5.68% compared to unencapsulated EPO after aeration for 48 h, which shows good protection performance of SSOS microcapsules to entrapped substances. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

Method: trans-resveratrol and 12 major human UCT isoforms were incubated in vitro and then glucuronic acid metabolites were determined by HPLC-MS, in order to preliminarily analyze the structure and observe the effect of different UGT isoforms on the generation rate of glucuronic acid metabolites. Result: In in vitro metabolic system, two metabolites-4′-O-monoglucuronide resveratrol (M-1) and 3-O-monoglucuronide resveratrol (M-2)-were generated from trans-resveratrol after being catalyzed by UCT. During the cause, generation of M-1 and M-2 were catalyzed by UGT1A1, UGT1A3, 1A8, 1A9 and1A10, whereas only UGT1A6 and 1A7 contributed to the formation of M-2. Both the formation rate of M-1 and M-2 catalyzed by UGT1A1, 1A10 and the formation of M-2 catalyzed by UGT1A8 slowed down with the increasing concentration of substrates, causing the phenomenon of "substrate inhibition". Conclusion: UGT1A1, 1A8, 1A9, 1A10 get involved in the formation of M-1, and of them UGT1A9 is the most important contributor. UGT1A3 also makes small contribution to the formation of M-1 and M-2, while other UGT isoforms show hardly any reaction with the trans-resveratrol phase II metabolites.

84862802615	Modeling and optimization of membrane preparation conditions of the alginate-based microcapsules with response surface methodology	Microencapsulation has been a promising approach for drug delivery, cell implantation, cell-based gene therapy and large-scale cell culture. To make use of microcapsules more effectively, it is important to accurately construct the microcapsule membranes with desired properties including a certain thickness, strength, and so forth. To date single factor experiments have been widely used, however, they are time-consuming to obtain the desired membrane preparation conditions. Response surface methodology (RSM) is a mathematical and statistical technique for building empirical models that gained importance for optimizing reacting conditions. In this study, three signifficant effect factors that affect alginate-based microcapsule membrane properties, including membrane thickness, swelling degree, and mechanical stability, were determined with Plackett-Burman method, and then three empirical models were built to optimize the preparation conditions of the microcapsule membranes according to the responses of these three signifficant effect factors respectively with RSM. These models can be used to predict the characteristics of microcapsules under different membrane preparation conditions, which provide a guide for optimizing the microencapsulation technology.

Methods: The bacteriostatic effects of chitosan gel of different molecular weights at various concentrations and chitosan-polyvinyl alcohol gel were compared by one dosage technique using E.coli as the test microbial. Results: The antimicrobial activity against E.coli was strengthened with increasing concentrations of chitosan. In contrast, the antimicrolical activity against E.coli became weaker with increasing molecular weights of chitosan. The gel with molecular weight less than 5 000 had no antimicrobial effect. Conclusion: We determined the effects of the concentration and molecular weight of chitosan in chitosan-polyvinyl alcohol gel. The optimal concentration and molecular weight of chitosan in chitosan-polyvinyl alcohol gel are 60 000 and 2%.

0037204422	Preparation of uniform calcium alginate gel beads by membrane emulsification coupled with internal gelation	With the objective of making calcium alginate gel beads with small and uniform size, membrane emulsification coupled with internal gelation was proposed. Spherical gel beads with mean size of about 50 μm, and even smaller ones in water, and with narrow size distribution were successfully obtained. Experimental studies focusing mainly on the effect of process parameters on bead properties were performed. The size of the beads was mainly dependent on the diameter of the membrane pores. High transmembrane pressure made for large gel beads with wide size distribution. Low sodium alginate concentration produced nonspherical beads, whereas a high concentration was unsuitable for the production of small beads with narrow distribution. Thus 1.5% w/v was enough. A high surfactant concentration favored the formation of small beads, but the adverse effect on mass transfer should be considered in this novel process. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

The structures of both beads were investigated with the aid of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal microscopy. It was shown that the beads with internal calcium source had a looser structure and bigger pore size than those with external calcium source. The attempts to interpret the difference were carried out by determining the Ca content within the beads at various times, which indicated that it was the different gelation mechanisms that caused the difference of structures of both beads. Furthermore, it was also found that the diffusion rate of haemoglobin (Hb) within the beads with an internal calcium source was faster than that of the beads with an external one, which was consistent with the observation of their structures.

The experimental results show that, due to the phase modulation of low Z and low-density materials to high energy X-ray, a certain image contrast could be formed. This effect is independent on X-ray energy, so in a certain range of sizes, simultaneous imaging of high Z high-density and low Z low-density materials in the high-energy X-ray is achieved, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional absorption imaging.

We compared the expression of sodium/myoinositol cotransporter (SMIT) and taurine transporter (TAUT) in HepG2 cells under different cultured conditions through real-time RT-PCR. The effects of exogenous anti-osmotic stress matter on cell viability and albumin level were also evaluated through MTT assay and ELISA assay. We did not find a significant difference in the expression of SMIT. However, the results showed that the expression level of TAUT in encapsulated cells was approximately 4.3 times higher than that of monolayer cells (P < 0.01). Accordingly, we found that taurine at 1-1.5 mM significantly increased the viability by 15%-30% and the biosynthetic function by 15% in microencapsulated HepG2 cells(P < 0.05). Trehalose, as for it, did not alter the biosynthetic function but increased the viability of the encapsulated cells by 20%-30% at 0.1 mM (P < 0.05). In conclusion, osmotic stress exists in the microcapsules and affects genes expression. Exogenous anti-osmotic stress matter can prevent the inhibition effects of hyper-osmotic stress on cellular growth.

Although the continuous passage process can generate numerous MSCs for clinical applications, this process may also have an important effect on the bological characteristics of fetal MSCs. In this study, the proliferation, stemness and cardiac differentiation properties of umbilical cord (UC) Wharton's Jelly-derived MSCs (WJ MSCs) at different passages (3, 7 and 14) was investigated. It was found that WJ MSC proliferation rate was decreased during the continuous passage process. And the ESC marker gene (Oct3/4, Nanog) expression in WJ MSCs also decreased gradually, while the early mesoderm marker gene (Vimentin) was highest at passage 7. Moreover, the cardiac marker gene (Nkx2.5) expression in differentiated MSCs increased during the continuous passage after cardiac induction.

84880750808	Encapsulated human hepatocellular carcinoma cells by alginate gel beads as an in vitro metastasis model	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and often forms metastases, which are the most important prognostic factors. For further elucidation of the mechanism underlying the progression and metastasis of HCC, a culture system mimicking the in vivo tumor microenvironment is needed. In this study, we investigated the metastatic ability of HCC cells cultured within alginate gel (ALG) beads. In the culture system, HCC cells formed spheroids by proliferation and maintained in nuclear abnormalities. The gene and protein expression of metastasis-related molecules was increased in ALG beads, compared with the traditional adhesion culture. Furthermore, several gene expression levels in ALG bead culture system were even closer to liver cancer tissues. More importantly, in vitro invasion assay showed that the invasion cells derived from ALG beads was 7.8-fold higher than adhesion cells. Our results indicated that the in vitro three-dimensional (3D) model based on ALG beads increased metastatic ability compared with adhesion culture, even partly mimicked the in vivo tumor tissues. Moreover, due to the controllable preparation conditions, steady characteristics and production at large-scale, the 3D ALG bead model would become an important tool used in the high-throughput screening of anti-metastasis drugs and the metastatic mechanism research. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Multicolor C-dots have been synthesized by chemical nitric acid oxidation using the reproducible plant soot as raw material. TEM analysis reveals that the prepared C-dots have an average size of 3.1 nm. The C-dots are well dispersed in aqueous solution and are strongly fluorescent under the irradiation of ultra-violet light. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization demonstrates that the O/C atomic ratio for C-dots change to from 0.207 to 0.436 due to the chemical oxidation process. The photo bleaching experiment reveals that the C-dots show excellent photostability as compared with the conventional organic dyes, fluorescein and rhodamine B. The fluorescence intensity of the C-dots did not change significantly in the pH range of 3-10. To further enhance the fluorescence quantum yield, the C-dots were surface modified with four types of passivation ligands, 4,7,10-trioxa-1,13-tridecanediamine (TTDDA), poly-L-lysine (PLL), cysteine and chitosan and the fluorescence quantum yields of the TTDDA, PLL, cysteine and chitosan passivated C-dots were improved 1.53-, 5.94-, 2.00- and 3.68-fold, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were employed to characterize the surface groups of the C-dots. The bio-application of the C-dots as fluorescent bio-probes was evaluated in cell imaging and ex vivo fish imaging, which suggests that the C-dots may have potential applications in biolabeling and bioimaging. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84880913958	The effect of electrostatic microencapsulation process on biological properties of tumour cells	Microencapsulation is one of the promising strategies to develop a three-dimensional in vivo tumour-mimic model in cancer research. Although previous studies have shown that tumour cells grow well during the microencapsulated culture, it is still not clear whether the electrostatic encapsulation process has an important effect on cellular characteristics. In this study, we investigated cellular response against non-physiological stress factors existing in the electrostatic microencapsulation process, such as the high-voltage electrostatic field, suspension and nutrition-free status. Our results showed that these non-physiological stress factors did not significantly induce cellular apoptosis, and did not affect cellular adhesion and viability. Furthermore, no change was found about invasion and drug resistance of the tumour cells.

The well-studied α-AP (alginate-α-poly-L-lysine) microcapsules have been restricted to large-scale cell-culture and clinical applications because of high costs and cytotoxic effects in some cases. This study used ε-poly-L-lysine (ε-PLL), a high-biocompatible and low-cost food additives produced by fermentation, to prepare ε-AP (alginate-ε-PLL) microcapsules with various thickness membranes and swelling behaviors. ε-AP microcapsules were permeable to BSA, a standard protein of culture medium. ε-AP- microencapsulated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells proliferated with culture time; no obvious difference with α-AP-microencapsulated CHO cells during the early 19 days. Whereas ε-AP-microencapsulated CHO cells kept higher viability (OD = 0.646 ± 0.012) on the 22nd day and microcapsule strength (integrity rate of 88%) on the 24th day than that of α-AP microcapsules (OD = 0.558 ± 0.025, integrity rate of 80%). ε-AP (alginate-ε-PLL) microcapsules exhibited more superior properties and could lower the costs to broaden the applications of microencapsulation technology. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84888115071	Effect of endoplasmic reticulum stress on lipid metabolism in microencapsulated HepG2 cells and exogenous regulation	To investigate the relationship of endoplasmic reticulum stress and lipid metabolism imbalance in microencapsulated cells, we compared the expression of glucose regulating protein 78 (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in HepG2 cells under different culture conditions using real-time PCR. Cell viability was measured by MTT and the content of cholesterol (CHO), triglyceride (TG) and albumin were evaluated through ELISA assay. The effect of 4-PBA treatment on above parameters were examined. Results show that the expression levels of GRP78 and CHOP in encapsulated cells were approximately 3.6 and 1.9 times higher than in monolayer cells (P < 0.05). As for the contents of CHO and TG, they were elevated to 1.7 and 3.2 times higher than monolayer cells (P < 0.05). With 1.0 mM 4-PBA treatment, genes expression of CHO and TG was reduced by 50% and 30%, respectively. Moreover, the contents of CHO and TG were reduced by 30% and 15%. The biosynthetic function was increased since day 10 with 4-PBA (P < 0.05). In conclusion, endoplasmic reticulum stress exists in the microcapsules and affects lipid metabolism. Antagonist 4-PBA can prevent the inhibition effects of endoplasmic reticulum stress on cellular growth.

84896080064	Enrichment of cancer stem cell-like cells by culture in alginate gel beads	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are most likely the reason of cancer reoccurrence and metastasis. For further elucidation of the mechanism underlying the characteristics of CSCs, it is necessary to develop efficient culture systems to culture and expand CSCs. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) culture system based on alginate gel (ALG) beads was reported to enrich CSCs. Two cell lines derived from different histologic origins were encapsulated in ALG beads respectively and the expansion of CSCs was investigated. Compared with two-dimensional (2D) culture, the proportion of cells with CSC-like phenotypes was significantly increased in ALG beads. Expression levels of CSC-related genes were greater in ALG beads than in 2D culture. The increase of CSC proportion after being cultured within ALG beads was further confirmed by enhanced tumorigenicity in vivo. Moreover, increased metastasis ability and higher anti-cancer drug resistance were also observed in 3D-cultured cells. Furthermore, we found that it was hypoxia, through the upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that occurred in ALG beads to induce the increasing of CSC proportion. Therefore, ALG bead was an efficient culture system for CSC enrichment, which might provide a useful platform for CSC research and promote the development of new anti-cancer therapies targeting CSCs. © 2014.

84896086571	Jolkinolide B inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by suppressing the activation NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways	Osteoclasts together with osteoblasts play pivotal roles in bone remodeling. The unique function and ability of osteoclasts to resorb bone makes them critical in both normal bone homeostasis and pathologic bone diseases such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, new compounds that may inhibit osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function may be of great value in the treatment of osteoclast-related diseases. In the present study, we examined the effect of jolkinolide B (JB), isolated from the root of Euphorbia fischeriana Steud on receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast formation. We found that JB inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation from bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) without cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the expression of osteoclastic marker genes, such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (CtsK), and calcitonin receptor (CTR), was significantly inhibited. JB inhibited RANKL-induced activation of NF-κB by suppressing RANKL-mediated IκBα degradation. Moreover, JB inhibited RANKL-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38, JNK, and ERK). This study thus identifies JB as an inhibitor of osteoclast formation and provides evidence that JB might be an alternative medicine for preventing and treating osteolysis. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84897497904	Improved probiotic viability in stress environments with post-culture of alginate-chitosan microencapsulated low density cells	In this study, probiotics (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y235) were entrapped in alginate-chitosan microcapsules by emulsification/internal gelation technique. Two different encapsulation patterns were established as directly entrapped high density cells (dEHDC) and entrapped low density cells with culture (ELDCwc). The performance of microencapsulated cells, with free cells (FC) as control, was investigated against sequential stress environments of freeze-drying, storage, and simulated gastrointestinal fluids. After being freeze-dried without cryoprotectant, the survival rate of ELDCwc (14.33%) was significantly higher than 10.00% of dEHDC, and 0.05% of FC. The lower temperature (-20 °C) and ELDCwc pattern were beneficial for keeping viable cells at 7.00 log CFU g

84901505245	Effect of plasma components on the stability and permeability of microcapsule	Immobilization of hepatocytes in microcapsules has been a potentially alternative methodology for bioartificial livers (BALs). Moreover, the stability and permeability are the key parameters of these microcapsules. However, these alginate-based microcapsules are unstable if the surrounding medium disrupts the ionic interactions between alginate and the polycation. As hundreds of components are included in human plasma, the stability and permeability in plasma of microcapsules need to be sufficiently investigated. In the present study, the stability of three kinds of alginate-based microcapsules was evaluated when they were immersed in plasma. Our results showed that stability of alginate-α-poly (l-lysine)-alginate (α-APA) microcapsules was well maintained, better than those of alginate-ε-poly (l-lysine)-alginate (ε-APA) and alginate-chitosan-alginate (ACA) microcapsules. Also, factors affecting the stability of microcapsules in plasma were analyzed and it showed that heparin was the key factor that affected the stability of α-APA microcapsules, whereas heparin and low molecular electrolytes such as HCO

84901978041	Effect of lipolysis on drug release from self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS) with different core/shell drug location	The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of lipolysis on the release of poorly water-soluble drug from SMEDDS in the perspective of drug core/shell location. For this purpose, four SMEDDS formulations with various core/shell properties were developed based on long-chain lipid or medium-chain lipid as well as different surfactant/oil ratios. Poorly water-soluble drugs, hymecromone and resveratrol, were significantly solubilized in all SMEDDS formulations and the diluted microemulsions. Fluorescence spectra analysis indicated that hymecromone was mainly located in the shell of microemulsions, while resveratrol was located in the core. The effect of lipolysis on the release rates of drugs with different core/shell locations were investigated by a modified in vitro drug release model. For the drug located in the shell, hymecromone, the release profiles were not affected during the lipolysis process and no significant differences were observed among four formulations. For the drug located in the core, resveratrol, the release rates were increased to various degrees depending on the extent of digestion. In conclusion, the drug core/shell location plays an important role for determining the effect of lipolysis on drug release from SMEDDS formulation. © 2014 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.

84906908221	Ghrelin receptor regulates appetite and satiety during aging in mice by regulating meal frequency and portion size but not total food intake	Aging is often associated with overweight and obesity. There exists a long-standing debate about whether meal pattern also contributes to the development of obesity. The orexigenic hormone ghrelin regulates appetite and satiety by activating its receptor, growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). In mice, circulating ghrelin concentrations and brain GHS-R expression were shown to increase with aging. To assess whether GHS-R regulates feeding pattern during aging, we studied meal patterns for the following cohorts of male mice fed a normal unpurified diet: 1) 3-4 mo, young wild-type (WT) mice; 2) 3-4 mo, young Ghsr-null (Ghsr

84908869529	Gastroretentive drug delivery systems for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori	Helicobacter pylori (H. Pylori) is one of the most common pathogenic bacterial infections and is found in the stomachs of approximately half of the world's population. It is the primary known cause of gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcer disease and gastric cancer. However, combined drug therapy as the general treatment in the clinic, the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, adverse reactions and poor patient compliance are major obstacles to the eradication of H. Pylori. Oral site-specific drug delivery systems that could increase the longevity of the treatment agent at the target site might improve the therapeutic effect and avoid side effects. Gastroretentive drug delivery systems potentially prolong the gastric retention time and controlled/sustained release of a drug, thereby increasing the concentration of the drug at the application site, potentially improving its bioavailability and reducing the necessary dosage. Recommended gastroretentive drug delivery systems for enhancing local drug delivery include floating systems, bioadhesive systems and expandable systems. In this review, we summarize the important physiological parameters of the gastrointestinal tract that affect the gastric residence time. We then focus on various aspects useful in the development of gastroretentive drug delivery systems, including current trends and the progress of novel forms, especially with respect to their application for the treatment of H. Pylori infections.

84920870086	The suppression of ghrelin signaling mitigates age-associated thermogenic impairment	Aging is associated with severe thermogenic impairment, which contributes to obesity and diabetes in aging. We previously reported that ablation of the ghrelin receptor, growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), attenuates age-associated obesity and insulin resistance. Ghrelin and obestatin are derived from the same preproghrelin gene. Here we showed that in brown adipocytes, ghrelin decreases the expression of thermogenic regulator but obestatin increases it, thus showing the opposite effects. We also found that during aging, plasma ghrelin and GHS-R expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) are increased, but plasma obestatin is unchanged. Increased plasma ghrelin and unchanged obestatin during aging may lead to an imbalance of thermogenic regulation, which may in turn exacerbate thermogenic impairment in aging. Moreover, we found that GHS-R ablation activates thermogenic signaling, enhances insulin activation, increases mitochondrial biogenesis, and improves mitochondrial dynamics of BAT. In addition, we detected increased norepinephrine in the circulation, and observed that GHS-R knockdown in brown adipocytes directly stimulates thermogenic activity, suggesting that GHS-R regulates thermogenesis via both central and peripheral mechanisms. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that ghrelin signaling is an important thermogenic regulator in aging. Antagonists of GHS-R may serve as unique anti-obesity agents, combating obesity by activating thermogenesis.

84925115454	Phenotype and differentiation capacity of human amniotic epithelial cells cultured in vitro	Background: Human amniotic epithelial cells are an important source of cells in regenerative medicine as its multipotentation, but new studies mainly focused on differentiation features and there were little research oneffect of culture in vitro on biological property of amniotic epithelial cells. Objective: To analyze the effects of in vitro culture on growth, cell phenotype and differentiation capacity of human amniotic epithelial cells into cardiomyocyte-like cells, and explore the correlation of primarily cultured human amniotic epithelial cells marker SSEA-4 expression level and the change of biological characteristics of human amniotic epithelial cells. Methods: Primarily cultured human amniotic epithelial cells were obtained from amniotic tissues by using the same separation protocol. Human amniotic epithelial cells were cultured in vitro. The proliferation, cell phenotype and the differentiation capacity of human amniotic epithelial cells into cardiomyocyte-like cells were evaluated by means of cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry and real-time PCR. Results And Conclusion: The SSEA-4 positive cells in primarily cultured human amniotic epithelial cells from different fetal tissues were between 26.7%-97%, which indicated that there was great individual difference among amniotic tissue samples. Moreover, with passage, the SSEA-4 expression in human amniotic epithelial cells decreased significantly, which did not correlate with the SSEA-4 expression in primarily cultured human amniotic epithelial cells. Results indicated that there was great individual difference in SSEA-4 expression level in primarily cultured human amniotic epithelial cells from different amniotic tissue samples. Thus, it is necessary to set up clinical screening indexes to get samples with higher SSEA-4 expression stably and to control the quality of human amniotic epithelial cells. In addition, during culture period, SSEA-4 expression level was affected by culture conditions. The culture conditions of human amniotic epithelial cells should be optimized to maintain SSEA-4 expression at a high level. In addition, the differentiation capacity of human amniotic epithelial cells into cardiomyocyte-like cells was also affected by individual difference among different samples and culture conditions, which will be further studied in the future.
