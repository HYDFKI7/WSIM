14944346734	A methodology for determining the resolvability of multiple vehicle occlusion in a monocular traffic image sequence	This paper proposed a knowledge-based methodology for determining the resolvability of N occluded vehicles seen in a monocular image sequence. The resolvability of each vehicle is determined by: firstly, deriving the relationship between the camera position and the number of vertices of a projected cuboid on the image; secondly, finding the direction of the edges of the projected cuboid in the image; and thirdly, modeling the maximum number of occluded cuboid edges of which the occluded cuboid is irresolvable. The proposed methodology has been tested rigorously on a number of real world monocular traffic image sequences that involves multiple vehicle occlusions, and is found to be able to successfully determine the number of occluded vehicles as well as the resolvability of each vehicle. We believe the proposed methodology will form the foundation for a more accurate traffic flow estimation and recognition system.

1842712360	Discriminative training approaches to fabric defect classification based on wavelet transform	Wavelet transform is able to characterize the fabric texture at multiscale and multiorientation, which provides a promising way to the classification of fabric defects. For the objective of minimum error rate in the defect classification, this paper compares six wavelet transform-based classification methods, using different discriminative training approaches to the design of the feature extractor and classifier. These six classification methods are: methods of using an Euclidean distance classifier and a neural network classifier trained by maximum likelihood method and backpropagation algorithm, respectively; methods of using an Euclidean distance classifier and a neural network classifier trained by minimum classification error method, respectively; method of using a linear transformation matrix-based feature extractor and an Euclidean distance classifier, designed by discriminative feature extraction (DFE) method; method of using an adaptive wavelet-based feature extractor and an Euclidean distance classifier, designed by the DFE method. These six approaches have been evaluated on the classification of 466 defect samples containing eight classes of fabric defects, and 434 nondefect samples. The DFE training approach using adaptive wavelet has been shown to outperform the other approaches, where 95.8% classification accuracy was achieved. © 2003 Pattern Recognition Society.

20444448136	Multi-scale space vehicle component identification	Vision based vehicle recognition systems have an important role in traffic surveillance. Most of these systems however fail to distinguish vehicles with similar dimensions due to the lack of other details. This paper presents a new scale space method for identifying components of moving vehicles to enable recognition eventually. In the proposed method, vehicles are first divided into multi-scale regions based on the center of gravity of the foreground vehicle mask. It utilizes both the texture scale space and the intensity scale space to determine regions that are homogenous in texture and intensity, from which vehicle components are identified based on the relations between these regions. This method was tested on over a hundred outdoor traffic images and the results are very promising. ©2004 IEEE.

0001046575	Segmentation of color images based on the gravitational clustering concept	A new clustering algorithm derived from the Markovian model of the gravitational clustering concept is proposed that works in the RGB measurement space for color image. To enable the model to be applicable in image segmentation, the new algorithm imposes a clustering constraint at each clustering iteration to control and determine the formation of multiple clusters. Using such constraint to limit the attraction between clusters, a termination condition can be easily defined. The new clustering algorithm is evaluated objectively and subjectively on three different images against the K-means clustering algorithm, the recursive histogram clustering algorithm for color (also known as the multi-spectral thresholding), the Hedley-Yan algorithm, and the widely used seed-based region growing algorithm. From the evaluation, it is observed that the new algorithm exhibits the following characteristics: (1) its objective measurement figures are comparable with the best in this group of segmentation algorithms; (2) it generates smoother region boundaries; (3) the segmented boundaries align closely with the original boundaries; and (4) it forms a meaningful number of segmented regions. © 1998 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

0003028143	Vehicle-Type Identification Through Automated Virtual Loop Assignment and Block-Based Direction-Biased Motion Estimation	This paper presents a method of automated virtual loop assignment and direction-based motion estimation. The unique features of our approach are that first, a number of loops are automatically assigned to each lane. The merit of doing this is that it accommodates pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) actions without needing further human interaction. Second, the size of the virtual loops is much smaller for estimation accuracy. This enables the use of standard block-based motion estimation techniques that are well developed for video coding. Third, the number of virtual loops per lane is large. The motion content of each block may be weighted and the collective result offers a more reliable and robust approach in motion estimation. Comparing this with traditional inductive loop detectors (ILDs), there are a number of advantages. First, the size and number of virtual loops may be varied to fine-tune detection accuracy. Second, it may also be varied for an effective utilization of the computing resources. Third, there is no failure rate associated with the virtual loops or physical installation. As the loops are defined on the image sequence, changing the detection configuration or redeploying the loops to other locations on the same image sequence requires only a change of the assignment parameters. Fourth, virtual loops may be reallocated anywhere on the frame, giving flexibility in detecting different parameters. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed method is effective in type classification.

0030382731	Reduction of false sharing by using process affinity in page-based distributed shared memory multiprocessor systems	In page-based distributed shared memory systems, a large page size makes efficient use of interconnection network, but increases the chance of false sharing, while a small page size reduces the level of false sharing, but results in an inefficient use of the network. This paper proposes a technique that uses process affinity to achieve data pages clustering so as to optimize the temporal data locality on DSM systems, and therefore reduces the chance of false sharing and improves the data locality. To quantify the degree of process affinity for a piece of data, a measure called process affinity index is used that indicates the closeness between this piece of data and the process. Simulation results show that process affinity technique improves the execution performance as page size increases due to the effective reduction of false sharing. In the best case, an order of magnitude performance improvement is achieved.

0030405051	Modified CPI filter algorithm for removing salt-and-pepper noise in digital images	In this paper, the theoretical aspects, implementation issues, and performance analysis of a modified CPI filter algorithm are presented. As the concept of the original CPI algorithm is to identify corrupted pixels by interrogating subimages, and considering the intensity spread of pixel values within the subimage when making a decision, the modified algorithm similarly takes into account the subimage gray level distribution across the whole gray scale. It works on the assumption that to consider which group in the subimage is corrupted, the multiple- feature histogram representing a subimage gray level distribution must be transformed into a two-feature histogram such that these two features can be mapped onto the two available pixel classes. This transformation is performed by using a 1-sigma decision about the mean intensity of the subimage, which enables pixels that fall inside the sigma bounds to be considered as uncorrupted, and the rest corrupted. A performance analysis of the modified CPI, original CPI, average, median and sigma algorithms is given for noisy images corrupted by salt-and- pepper noise of the impulsive and Gaussian nature, and gray noise over the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of plus 50 dB to minus 50 dB. The results show that similar to the original CPI algorithm, the modified CPI algorithm exhibits a number of desirable features. Firstly, due to its pixel identification property, it has better noise removing capability than the conventional filter algorithms. Secondly, most features in the original image are preserved in the restored image compared with, say, the median filter. Thirdly, iterative filtering of a noisy image using the CPI algorithm is possible.

0030409609	Performance analysis of the doubly-linked list protocol family for distributed shared memory systems	The doubly-linked list (DLL) protocol provides a memory efficient, scalable, high-performance and yet easy to implement method to maintain memory coherence in distributed shared memory (DSM) systems. In this paper, the performance analysis of the DLL family of protocols is presented. Theoretically, the DLL protocol with stable owners has the shortest remote memory access latency among the DLL protocol family. According to the simulated performance evaluation, the DLL-S protocol is 65.7% faster than the DDM algorithm for the linear equation solver; and is 16.5% faster for the matrix multiplier. From the trend of the performance figures, it is predicted that the improvement in performance due to the DLL-S protocol will be considerably greater when a larger number of processors are used, indicating that the DLL-S protocol is also the most scalable of the protocols tested.

0030416216	New feature preserving noise removal algorithm based on the discrete cosine transform and the a prior knowledge of pixel type	In this paper, a new Corrupted-Pixel-Identification (CPI) based estimation filter is presented. The method is especially useful for filtering clustered noise. After the corrupted pixels are identified by the CPI algorithm, the noisy subimage centered on a corrupted pixel is transformed into its Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain where the transformed subimage is approximated by its DC coefficient only. With the knowledge of the number of corrupted pixels in the subimage from the CPI algorithm, an estimation of the noise distribution can be made, from which the DC coefficient of the restored subimage can be determined. Hence, noise filtering is achieved. From the experimental results, we can show that the CPI-based estimation filter has three desirable characteristics: 1) it has superior noise removal performance over the conventional median filter and CPI-based median filter in filtering clustered noise; 2) it has good feature preserving property (better than conventional filters); and 3) the computing speed of the filter is almost three times faster than the conventional median filter.

0030421194	Time domain analysis/resynthesis of musical tones based on polynomial interpolation techniques	In this paper, a novel algorithm employing polynomial interpolation techniques is proposed for the analysis and resynthesis of musical tones, based on time domain information. This algorithm models a single period of oscillation as a series of features, with curves joining such features together. The trajectories of these features and the shape of the curves across the whole input signal can be parameterised, such that the signal can be analysed and resynthesised as a close approximation to the original. The current research introduced an alternative approach to analyse/resynthesise sampled musical signals in the frequency domain, one which characterises a signal by its physical structure rather than its frequency components. The results from this analysis can be used to further refine existing physical models of musical instruments.

0031331505	Vehicle navigation strategy based on behavior fusion	In this paper, a new navigation strategy based on the fusion of various behaviors to enable mobile vehicles to navigate in an unknown environment is described. The aim of this research is to fuse the two independent and sometimes conflicting behaviors: obstacle avoidance and goal seeking, such that the vehicle efficiently performs obstacle avoidance while seeking it's goal. The balance between these two behaviors is achieved by combining the control actions from the goal seeker and the obstacle avoidor through evaluating the goal vector magnitude, the minimum distance detected by the ultrasonic sensors, and the distance to the obstacle in the direction of the goal vector. Furthermore, an environment evaluator is used to enhance the adaptability of the navigator by tuning the universe of discourse of the sensor space. The new navigation strategy has been verified to be efficient in an indoor virtual environment.

A 3D solid cuboid model with up to six vertices is employed to fit any vehicle images, by varying the vertices for a best fit. The advantage of using such a model is that the number of parameterized vertices is small which can be easily deformed. Occlusion is detected by recording the changes in the Area Ratio and the dimensions of the generalized deformable model. Our tests show that the new modeling algorithm is effective in detecting vehicle occlusion.

0032316543	Adaptive fuzzy approach to obstacle avoidance	Reinforcement learning based on a new training method previously reported guarantees convergence and an almost complete set of rules. However, there are two shortcomings remained: first, the membership functions of the input sensor readings are determined manually and take the same form; and second, there are still a small number of blank rules needed to be manually inserted. To address these two issues, this paper proposes an adaptive fuzzy approach using a supervised learning method based on back propagation to determine the parameters for the membership functions for each sensor reading. By having different input fuzzy sets, each sensor reading contributes differently in avoiding obstacles. Our simulations show that the proposed system converges rapidly to a complete set of rules, and if there are no conflicting input-output data pairs in the training sets, the proposed system performs collision-free obstacle avoidance.

Through simulation, it has been confirmed that the navigator having this steering behavior can tackle multiple moving obstacles successfully at much higher speed compared with those without. Furthermore, it does not require any a priori knowledge of the obstacles' motion.

2342650830	Highly accurate texture-based vehicle segmentation method	In modern traffic surveillance, computer vision methods have often been employed to detect vehicles of interest because of the rich information content contained in an image. Segmentation of moving vehicles using image processing and analysis algorithms has been an important research topic in the past decade. However, segmentation results are strongly affected by two issues: moving cast shadows and reflective regions, both of which reduce accuracy and require postprocessing to alleviate the degradation. We propose an efficient and highly accurate texture-based method for extracting the boundary of vehicles from the stationary background that is free from the effect of moving cast shadows and reflective regions. The segmentation method utilizes the differences in textural property between the road, vehicle cast shadow, reflection on the vehicle, and the vehicle itself, rather than just the intensity differences between them. By further combining the luminance and chrominance properties into an OR map, a number of foreground vehicle masks are constructed through a series of morphological operations, where each mask describes the outline of a moving vehicle. The proposed method has been tested on real-world traffic image sequences and achieved an average error rate of 3.44% for 50 tested vehicle images. © 2004 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

2542445418	The architecture for a real-time traffic multimedia internet geographic information system	Accurate and timely traffic information enables road users to make informed decisions to enable them to optimise their route choices by avoiding congestion. Such information is instrumental to transport management as bus and taxi operators can reschedule their fleets in response to prevailing traffic conditions to minimise the effects of traffic congestion on their services. The information can also be used by the traffic management control centres of transport and highway authorities to streamline the timing control of traffic signals and the broadcast of traffic advice via variable message signs. Real-time traffic information is gathered from point-based traffic surveillance and monitoring detectors, and the piecemeal data fitted to interpolate or model road conditions over a transport network. The process of gathering and transforming point-based traffic data to display an area view is computationally intensive and often fails to meet the instant requirements of a real-time traffic information system. The authors propose a real-time traffic multimedia Internet geographic information system that is capable of transmitting video images and modelling road conditions in real time. The prototype system is capable of calibrating data from traffic closed-circuit television images that are modelled over the entire road network for broadcasting to road users on the world-wide web with a time lapse of 3-4 minutes. The authors also suggest potential applications of the prototype system.

25844500310	An efficient parameterless quadrilateral-based image segmentation method	This paper proposes a general quadrilateral-based framework for image segmentation, in which quadrilaterals are first constructed from an edge map, where neighboring quadrilaterals with similar features of interest are then merged together to form regions. Under the proposed framework, the quadrilaterals enable the elimination of local variations and unnecessary details for merging from which each segmented region is accurately and completely described by a set of quadrilaterals. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we derived an efficient and high-performance parameterless quadrilateral-based segmentation algorithm from the framework. The proposed algorithm shows that the regions obtained under the framework are segmented into multiple levels of quadrilaterals that accurately represent the regions without severely over or undersegmenting them. When evaluated objectively and subjectively, the proposed algorithm performs better than three other segmentation techniques, namely, seeded region growing, K-means clustering and constrained gravitational clustering, and offers an efficient description of the segmented objects conducive to content-based applications. © 2005 IEEE.

27944435493	Double action Q-learning for obstacle avoidance in a dynamically changing environment	In this paper, we propose a new method for solving the reinforcement learning problem in a dynamically changing environment, as in vehicle navigation, in which the Markov Decision Process used in traditional reinforcement learning is modified so that the response of the environment is taken into consideration for determining the agent's next state. This is achieved by changing the action-value function to handle three parameters at a time, namely, the current state, action taken by the agent, and action taken by the environment. As it considers the actions by the agent and environment, it is termed "Double Action". Based on the Q-learning method, the proposed method is implemented and the update rule is modified to handle all of the three parameters. Preliminary results show that the proposed method has the sum of rewards (negative) 89.5% less than that of the traditional method. Apart form that, our new method also has the total number of collisions and mean steps used in one episode 89.5% and 15.5% lower than that of the traditional method respectively. © 2005 IEEE.

Preliminary results show that the new method has the sum of rewards (negative) 29.4% and 93.6% less than that of the traditional method in an environment of 10 obstacles and 50 obstacles respectively. The mean no. of steps used in one episode is up to 26.0% lower than that of the traditional method. The new method also fares better as the number of obstacles increases. © 2005 IEEE.

29144497884	Robust fabric defect detection and classification using multiple adaptive wavelets	The wavelet transform has been widely used for defect detection and classification in fabric images. The detection and classification performance of the wavelet transform approach is closely related to the selection of the wavelet. Instead of predetermining a wavelet, a method of designing a wavelet adapting to the detection or classification of the fabric defects has been developed. For further improvement of the performance, this paper extends the adaptive wavelet-based methodology from the use of a single adaptive wavelet to multiple adaptive wavelets. For each class of fabric defect, a defect-specific adaptive wavelet was designed to enhance the defect region at one channel of the wavelet transform, where the defect region can be detected by using a simple threshold classifier. Corresponding to the multiple defect-specific adaptive wavelets, the multiscale edge responses to defect regions have been shown to be more efficient in characterising the defects, which leads to a new approach to the classification of defects. In comparison with the single adaptive wavelet approach, the use of multiple adaptive wavelets yields better performance on defect detection and classification, especially for defects that are poorly detected by the single adaptive wavelet approach. The proposed method using multiple adaptive wavelets has been evaluated on the inspection of 56 images containing eight classes of fabric defects, and 64 images without defects, where 98.2% detection rate and 1.5% false alarm rate were achieved in defect detection, and 97.5% classification accuracy was achieved in defect classification.

32544459536	Performance improvement of edge detection based on edge likelihood index	One of the problems of conventional edge detectors is the difficulty in distinguishing noise and true edges correctly using a simple measurement, such as gradient, local energy, or phase congruency. This paper proposes a performance improvement algorithm for edge detection based on a composite measurement called Edge Likelihood Index (ELI). In principle, given a raw edge map obtained from any edge detectors, edge contours can be extracted where gradient, continuity and smoothness of each contour are measured. The ELI of an edge contour is defined as directly proportional to its gradient and length, and inversely proportional to its smoothness, which offers a more flexible representation of true edges, such as those with low gradient, but continuous and smooth. The proposed method was tested on the South Florida data sets, using the Canny edge operator for edge detection, and evaluated using the Receiver Operator Characteristic curves. It can be shown that the proposed method reduces Bayes risk of ROC curves by over 10% in the aggregate test results.

In this paper, a new method for textile defect classification is proposed by using discriminative wavelet frames. Multiscale texture properties of textile image are characterized by its wavelet frames representation. For a better description of the latent structure of textile image, wavelet frames adapted to textile are generated rather than using standard ones. Based on Discriminative Feature Extraction (DFE) method, the wavelet frames and the back-end classifier are simultaneously designed with the common objective of minimizing classification errors. The proposed method has been evaluated on the classification of 466 defect samples containing eight classes of textile defects, and 434 nondefect samples. In comparison with standard wavelet frames, the designed discriminative wavelet frames has been shown to largely improve the classification performance, where 95.8% classification accuracy was achieved. © 2005 IEEE.

34447267714	New method for overcoming ill-conditioning in vanishing-point-based camera calibration	A common problem in vanishing-point-based camera calibration methods is that they are ill-conditioned when the parallel lines for calibration in the world coordinates also appear to be parallel or near-parallel in the image coordinates. Then the camera parameters are not calculable or incur substantial error because one of the vanishing points approaches infinity. We propose a new method that overcomes the ill-conditioning. Using lane markings on a road to form a rectangular calibration pattern with two vanishing points, we first derive a set of equations based on one vanishing point without assuming any extrinsic parameters being known a priori. Because only one vanishing point can approach infinity at any one time, ill-conditioning can be avoided completely by selecting the vanishing point that does not suffer from it. This enables us to produce a set of extrinsic camera parameters that maps the world and image coordinates accurately. Simulation and real image tests show that the proposed method conquers ill-conditioning successfully and is insensitive to pixel offset on the calibration pattern. © 2007 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

34547143627	A novel algorithm for estimating vehicle speed from two consecutive images	In this paper, we present a new algorithm for estimating individual vehicle speed based on two consecutive images captured from a traffic safety camera system. Its principles are first, both images are transformed from the image plane to the 3D world coordinates based on the calibrated camera parameters. Second, the difference of the two transformed images is calculated, resulting in the background being eliminated and vehicles in the two images are mapped onto one image. Finally, a block feature of the vehicle closest to the ground is matched to estimate vehicle travel distance and speed. Experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits good and consistent performance. When compared with speed measurements obtained from speed radar, averaged estimation errors are 3.27% and 8.51% for day-time and night-time test examples respectively, which are better than other previously published results. The proposed algorithm can be easily extended to work on image sequences. © 2007 IEEE.

34548525509	A method for vehicle count in the presence of multiple-vehicle occlusions in traffic images	This paper proposes a novel method for accurately counting the number of vehicles that are involved in multiple-vehicle occlusions, based on the resolvability of each occluded vehicle, as seen in a monocular traffic image sequence. Assuming that the occluded vehicles are segmented from the road background by a previously proposed vehicle segmentation method and that a deformable model is geometrically fitted onto the occluded vehicles, the proposed method first deduces the number of vertices per individual vehicle from the camera configuration. Second, a contour description model is utilized to describe the direction of the contour segments with respect to its vanishing points, from which individual contour description and vehicle count are determined. Third, it assigns a resolvability index to each occluded vehicle based on a resolvability model, from which each occluded vehicle model is resolved and the vehicle dimension is measured. The proposed method has been tested on 267 sets of real-world monocular traffic images containing 3074 vehicles with multiple-vehicle occlusions and is found to be 100% accurate in calculating vehicle count, in comparison with human inspection. By comparing the estimated dimensions of the resolved generalized deformable model of the vehicle with the actual dimensions published by the manufacturers, the root-mean-square error for width, length, and height estimations are found to be 48, 279, and 76 mm, respectively. © 2007 IEEE.

36849085445	Vehicle-component identification based on multiscale textural couriers	This paper presents a novel method for identifying vehicle components in a monocular traffic image sequence. In the proposed method, the vehicles are first divided into multiscale regions based on the center of gravity of the foreground vehicle mask and the calibrated-camera parameters. With these multiscale regions, textural couriers are generated based on the localized variances of the foreground vehicle image. A new scale-space model is subsequently created based on the textural couriers to provide a topological structure of the vehicle. In this model, key feature points of the vehicle can significantly be described based on the topological structure to determine the regions that are homogenous in texture from which vehicle components can be identified by segmenting the key feature points. Since no motion information is required in order to segment the vehicles prior to recognition, the proposed system can be used in situations where extensive observation time is not available or motion information is unreliable. This novel method can be used in real-world systems such as vehicle-shape reconstruction, vehicle classification, and vehicle recognition. This method was demonstrated and tested on 200 different vehicle samples captured in routine outdoor traffic images and achieved an average error rate of 6.8% with a variety of vehicles and traffic scenes. © 2006 IEEE.

37249037454	Fast-maneuvering target seeking based on double-action Q-learning	In this paper, a reinforcement learning method called DAQL is proposed to solve the problem of seeking and homing onto a fast maneuvering target, within the context of mobile robots. This Q-learning based method considers both target and obstacle actions when determining its own action decisions, which enables the agent to learn more effectively in a dynamically changing environment. It particularly suits fast-maneuvering target cases, in which maneuvers of the target are unknown a priori. Simulation result depicts that the proposed method is able to choose a less convoluted path to reach the target when compared to the ideal proportional navigation (IPN) method in handling fast maneuvering and randomly moving target. Furthermore, it can learn to adapt to the physical limitation of the system and do not require specific initial conditions to be satisfied for successful navigation towards the moving target. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

It exploits data parallelism inherent in the coding process and performs task scheduling base on task data size and access locality with the aim to hide as much communication overhead as possible. Utilizing Petri-nets and task graphs for representation and analysis, the method enables parallel video frame capturing, buffering and encoding without extra communication overhead. The theoretical speedup analysis indicates that this method offers excellent communication hiding, resulting in system efficiency well above 90%. A H.261 video encoder has been implemented on a TMS320C80 system using this method, and its performance was measured. The theoretical and measured performances are similar in that the measured speedup of the H.261 is 3.67 and 3.76 on four PP for QCIF and 352×240 video, respectively. They correspond to frame rates of 30.7 frame per second (fps) and 9.25 fps, and system efficiency of 91.8% and 94% respectively. As it is, this method is particularly efficient for platforms with small number of parallel processors.

Second, there is no failure rate associated with the virtual loops and installation and maintenance cost can be kept to a minimum. Third, virtual loops may be re-allocated anywhere on the frame, giving flexibility in detecting different parameters.

The matching adopts a high tolerant scheme allowing characters to have certain degree of shifting, rotation and mis-match. This proves to be an important criterion for successful recognition. Preliminary tests show that this method offers high success rate and high confident level.

0034247777	Lane detection by orientation and length discrimination	This paper describes a novel lane detection algorithm for visual traffic surveillance applications under the auspice of intelligent transportation systems. Traditional lane detection methods for vehicle navigation typically use spatial masks to isolate instantaneous lane information from on-vehicle camera images. When surveillance is concerned, complete lane and multiple lane information is essential for tracking vehicles and monitoring lane change frequency from overhead cameras, where traditional methods become inadequate. The algorithm presented in this paper extracts complete multiple lane information by utilizing prominent orientation and length features of lane markings and curb structures to discriminate against other minor features. Essentially, edges are first extracted from the background of a traffic sequence, then thinned and approximated by straight lines. From the resulting set of straight lines, orientation and length discriminations are carried out three-dimensionally with the aid of two-dimensional (2-D) to three-dimensional (3-D) coordinate transformation and K-means clustering. By doing so, edges with strong orientation and length affinity are retained and clustered, while short and isolated edges are eliminated. Overall, the merits of this algorithm are as follows. First, it works well under practical visual surveillance conditions. Second, using K-means for clustering offers a robust approach. Third, the algorithm is efficient as it only requires one image frame to determine the road center lines. Fourth, it computes multiple lane information simultaneously. Fifth, the center lines determined are accurate enough for the intended application.

38949156800	Motif-based defect detection for patterned fabric	This paper proposes a generalized motif-based method for detecting defects in 16 out of 17 wallpaper groups in 2D patterned texture. It assumes that most patterned texture can be decomposed into lattices and their constituents-motifs. It then utilizes the symmetry property of motifs to calculate the energy of moving subtraction and its variance among different motifs. By learning the distribution of these values over a number of defect-free patterns, boundary conditions for discerning defective and defect-free patterns can be determined. This paper presents the theoretical foundation of the method, and defines the relations between motifs and lattice, from which a new concept called energy of moving subtraction is derived using norm metric measurement between a collection of circular shift matrices of motif and itself. It has been shown in this paper that the energy of moving subtraction amplifies the defect information of the defective motif. Together with its variance, an energy-variance space is further defined where decision boundaries are drawn for classifying defective and defect-free motifs. As the 16 wallpaper groups of patterned fabric can be transformed into three major groups, the proposed method is evaluated over these three major groups, from which 160 defect-free lattices samples are used for defining the decision boundaries, with 140 defect-free and 113 defective samples used for testing. An overall detection success rate of 93.32% is achieved for the proposed method. No other generalized approach can achieve this success rate has been reported before, and hence this result outperforms all other previously published approaches. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

84896996089	Sub-scene segmentation using constraints based on Gestalt principles	In this paper, an unsupervised sub-scene segmentation method is proposed. It emphasizes on generating more integrated and semantically consistent regions instead of homogeneous but detailed over-segmented regions usually produced by conventional segmentation methods. Several properties of sub-scenes are explored such as proximity grouping, area of influence, similarity and harmony based on psychological principles. These properties are formulated into constraints that are used directly in the proposed sub-scene segmentation. A self-determined approach is conducted to get the optimal segmentation result based on the characteristics of each image in an unsupervised manner. The proposed method is evaluated over three datasets. For quantitative evaluation, the performance of the proposed method is on par with state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods; for qualitative evaluation, the proposed method handles various sub-scenes well, and produces neater results. The sub-scenes segmented by the proposed method are generally consistent with natural scene categories. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

4544342966	A novel method for resolving vehicle occlusion in a monocular traffic-image sequence	This paper presents a novel method for resolving the occlusion of vehicles seen in a sequence of traffic images taken from a single roadside mounted camera. Its concept is built upon a previously proposed vehicle-segmentation method, which is able to extract the vehicle shape out of the background accurately without the effect of shadows and other visual artifacts. Based on the segmented shape and that the shape can be represented by a simple cubical model, we propose a two-step method: first, detect the curvature of the shape contour to generate a data set of the vehicles occluded and, second, decompose it into individual vehicle models using a vanishing point in three dimensions and the set of curvature points of the composite model. The proposed method has been tested on a number of monocular traffic-image sequences and found that it detects the presence of occlusion correctly and resolves most of the occlusion cases involving two vehicles. It only fails when the occlusion was very severe. Further analysis of vehicle dimension also shows that the average estimation accuracy for vehicle width, length, and height are 94.78%, 94.09%, and 95.44%, respectively.

From the symmetry properties of motifs, the energy of moving subtraction and its variance among motifs are mapped onto an energy-variance space. By learning the distribution of defect-free and defective patterns in this space, boundaries conditions can be determined for defect detection purpose. The proposed method is evaluated on four wallpaper categories, from which all 16 wallpaper groups can be generalized. Altogether, 160 defect-free lattices samples are used for learning the decision boundaries; and 200 other defect-free and 138 other defective samples are used for testing. An overall detection accuracy has reached 93.61%, which outperforms previous approaches. © 2007 IEEE.

Here, the overtaking problem is solved by considering the destination seeking goal and collision avoidance goal simultaneously. The host vehicle uses Double-action Q-Learning for collision avoidance and Q-learning for destination seeking by learning to react with different motions carried out by a leading vehicle. Simulations show that the proposed method performs well disregarding whether the vehicle to be overtaken holds a steady or un-steady course. Given the promising results, better navigation is expected if additional goals such as lane following is introduced in the multiple-goal framework. © 2007 IEEE.

49649092754	A novel merging criterion incorporating boundary smoothness and region homogeneity for image segmentation	A novel joint region merging criterion combining region homo-geneity and boundary smoothness is proposed. Previous watershed segmentation method which utilizes region homogeneity or edge integrity or both gives good results in some cases. However, for complex scenes such as images of a vehicle with irregular roadside objects reflected on the window panes, it tends to give undesired segmentation results with region boundaries not residing on real physical boundaries. Aiming at improving the segmentation of these complex scenes, we propose the incorporation of an additional measure of boundary smoothness into a new joint criterion. Based on this, an affine transform invariant measure of the smoothness of boundaries is developed, which is the equivalent width of the energy distribution function over frequencies, obtained from Fourier descriptors of the boundary. Experimental results and evaluation are presented in this paper to demonstrate the merits of the proposed method. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

The proposed method is based on the concept of modeling vehicle components graphically in an object hierarchy. By extracting component description of a vehicle, constructing a representative partial graph and matching it with the vehicle graph model defined a priori, the missing components due to visual occlusion can be identified. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method can partition the clustered graph of SOVs in image that are located far away from the camera as well as identifying the missing components of the vehicles. Moreover, it can classify the vehicle type based on the missing components as well as the vehicle graph model. © 2007 IEEE.

56149093761	Extraction of moving human objects from their background using bi-thresholding and boundary evaluation	The extraction of moving objects from image sequence of a static scene is an important task in computer vision. However, given an input image and the corresponding background image, due to the intersection of the foreground pixels and background pixels in the measurement space, it is challenging to identify a single threshold that can resolve the ambiguity in a satisfactory manner. In this paper, we propose a novel method for accurately classifying pixels into foreground and background based on two thresholded masks. Firstly, we produce two boundaries by automatically selecting two thresholds. Secondly, points are matched between these two boundaries by using dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm and boundary segment pairs that are significantly different are identified. Thirdly, shadow, curvature and edge responses associated with each segment pair are evaluated for deducing the final boundary. Experimental results show that substantial improvement can be achieved by using the proposed method. Compared with other change detection methods, the proposed method produces more accurate and pleasing results.

63549108762	Scene categorization with multi-scale category-specific visual words	In this paper, we propose a scene categorization method based on multi-scale category-specific visual words. The proposed method quantizes visual words in a multi-scale manner which combines the global-feature-based and local-feature-based scene categorization approaches into a uniform framework. Unlike traditional visual word creation methods which quantize visual words from the whole training images without considering their categories, we form visual words from the training images grouped in different categories then collate the visual words from different categories to form the final codebook. This category-specific strategy provides us with more discriminative visual words for scene categorization. Based on the codebook, we compile a feature vector that encodes the presence of different visual words to represent a given image. A SVM classifier with linear kernel is then employed to select the features and classify the images. The proposed method is evaluated over two scene classification datasets of 6,447 images altogether using 10-fold cross-validation. The results show that the classification accuracy has been improved significantly comparing with the methods using the traditional visual words. And the proposed method is comparable to the best results published in the previous literatures in terms of classification accuracy rate and has the advantage in terms of simplicity. © 2009 SPIE-IS&T.

62949202695	Multi-scale feature density approximation for object representation and tracking	This paper proposes a scale-consistent feature density estimation method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for robustly tracking video object under scale variation and partial occlusion. Scale consistency is achieved in both feature extraction and feature density estimation. Firstly, an image is partitioned into patches in the scale space that matches the scale of the local image pattern and the size that includes the most basic image pattern, from which scale consistent image features are extracted. Secondly, to invariantly estimate the feature density against the variation in image partition caused by the object's changing scale, an observational credible probability is defined for each patch and used to control its feature's contribution in the feature density estimation according to the size of the patch. Thirdly, the likelihood function defined by both the extracted features and their observational credible probability are maximized in the GMM parameter estimation. Moreover, partial occlusion on the patches which has repeated features does not affect the object's global appearance. Experiment results show that this method effectively tracks objects with scale variation and partial occlusion in the image sequence.

64549114636	Scene categorization with multiscale categoryspecific visual words	We propose a novel scene categorization method based on multiscale category-specific visual words. The novelty of the proposed method lies In two aspects: (1) visual words are quantized In a multiscale manner that combines the global-feature-based and local-feature-based scene categorization approaches into a uniform framework; (2) unlike traditional visual word creation methods, which quantize visual words from the entire set of training, we form visual words from the training images grouped in different categories and then collate visual words from different categories to form the final codebook. This generation strategy Is capable of enhancing the discriminative ability of the visual words, which is useful for achieving better classification performance. The proposed method is evaluated over two scene classification data sets with 8 and 13 scene categories, respectively. The experimental results show that the classification performance is significantly improved by using the multiscale category-specific visual words over that achieved by using the traditional visual words. Moreover, the proposed method Is comparable with the best methods reported in previous literature in terms of classification accuracy rate (88.81% and 85.05% accuracy rates for data sets 1 and 2, respectively) and has the advantage in simplicity. © 2009 Society of Photo Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

70349293774	Scale robust adaptive feature density approximation for visual object representation and tracking	Feature density approximation (FDA) based visual object appearance representation is emerging as an effective method for object tracking, but its challenges come from object's complex motion (e.g. scaling, rotation) and the consequent object's appearance variation. The traditional adaptive FDA methods extract features in fixed scales ignoring the object's scale variation, and update FDA by sequential Maximum Likelihood estimation, which lacks robustness for sparse data. In this paper, to solve the above challenges, a robust multi-scale adaptive FDA object representation method is proposed for tracking, and its robust FDA updating method is provided. This FDA achieve robustness by extracting features in the selected scale and estimating feature density using a new likelihood function defined both by feature set and the feature's effectiveness probability. In FDA updating, robustness is achieved updating FDA in a Bayesian way by MAP-EM algorithm using density prior knowledge extracted from historical density. Object complex motion (e.g. scaling and rotation) is solved by correlating object appearance with its spatial alignment. Experimental results show that this method is efficient for complex motion, and robust in adapting the object appearance variation caused by changing scale, illumination, pose and viewing angel.

0034784237	Vehicle shape approximation from motion for visual traffic surveillance	In this paper, a vehicle shape approximation method based on the vehicle motion in a typical traffic image sequence is proposed. In the proposed method, instead of using the 2D image data directly, the intrinsic 3D data is estimated in a monocular image sequence. Given the binary vehicle mask and the camera parameters, the vehicle shape is estimated by the four stages shape approximation method. These stages include feature point extraction, feature point motion estimation between two consecutive frames, feature point height estimation from motion vector, and the 3D shape estimation based on the feature point height. We have tested our method using real world traffic image sequence and the vehicle height profile and dimensions are estimated to be reasonably close to the actual dimensions.

0035057913	Adaptive parallel video-coding algorithm	Parallel encoding of video inevitably frame rate gives varying rate performance due to dynamically changing video content and motion field since the encoding process of each macro-block, especially motion estimation, is data dependent. A multiprocessor schedule optimized for a particular frame with certain macro-block encoding time may not be optimized towards another frame with different encoding time, which causes performance degradation to the parallelization. To tackle this problem, we propose a method based on a batch of near-optimal schedules generated at compile-time and a run-time mechanism to select the schedule giving the shortest predicted critical path length. This method has the advantage of being near-optimal using compile-time schedules while involving only run-time selection rather than re-scheduling. Implementation on the IBM SP2 multiprocessor system using 24 processors gives an average speedup of about 13.5 (frame rate of 38.5 frames per second) for a CIF sequence consisting of segments of 6 different scenes. This is equivalent to an average improvement of about 16.9% over the single schedule scheme with schedule adapted to each of the scenes. Using an open test sequence consisting of 8 video segments, the average improvement achieved is 13.2%, i.e. an average speedup of 13.3 (35.6 frames per second).

0035108580	Spatial and temporal data parallelization of the H.261 video coding algorithm	In this paper, the parallelization of the H.261 video coding algorithm on the IBM SP2 multiprocessor system is described. The effect of parallelizing computations and communications in the spatial, temporal, and both spatial-temporal domains are considered through the study of frame rate, speedup, and implementation efficiency, which are modeled and measured with respect to the number of nodes (n) and parallel methods used. Four parallel algorithms were developed, of which the first two exploited the spatial parallelism in each frame, and the last two exploited both the temporal and spatial parallelism over a sequence of frames. The two spatial algorithms differ in that one utilizes a single communication master, while the other attempts to distribute communications across three masters. On the other hand, the spatial-temporal algorithms use a pipeline structure for exploiting the temporal parallelism together with either a single master or multiple masters. The best median speedup (frame rate) achieved was close to 15[15 frames per second (fps)] for 352 × 240 video on 24 nodes, and 13 (37 fps) for QCIF video, by the spatial algorithm with distributed communications. For n < 10, the single-master spatial algorithm performs better with efficiency up to 90%, while the multiple-master spatial algorithm is superior for n > 10, with efficiency up to 70%. The spatial-temporal algorithms achieved average speedup performance, but are most scalable for large n.

0034507010	Parallelization methodology for video coding - an implementation on the TMS320C80	This paper presents a parallelization methodology for video coding based on the philosophy of hiding as much communications by computation as possible. It models the task/data size, processor cache capacity, and communication contention, through a systematic decomposition and scheduling approach. With the aid of Petri-nets and task graphs for representation and analysis, it employs a triple buffering scheme to enable the functions of frame capture, management, and coding to be performed in parallel. The theoretical speedup analysis indicates that this method offers excellent communication hiding, resulting in system efficiency well above 90%. To prove its practicality, a H.261 video encoder has been implemented on a TMS320C80 system using the method. Its performance was measured, from which the speedup and efficiency figures were calculated. The only difference detected between the theoretical and measured data is the program control overhead that has not been accounted for in the theoretical model. Even with this, the measured speedup of the H.261 is 3.67 and 3.76 on four parallel processors (PPs) for QCIF and 352 × 240 video, respectively, which correspond to frame rate of 30.7 and 9.25 frames per second, and system efficiency of 91.8% and 94%, respectively. This method is particularly efficient for platforms with small number of parallel processors.

0034854137	Fabric defect detection using adaptive wavelet	This paper studies the adaptive wavelet design for fabric defect detection. In order to achieve translation invariance and more flexible design, the wavelet design focused on nonsubsampled wavelet transform. We design the wavelet filters under the constraints that the analysis filters are power complementary, and the wavelet has only one vanishing moment, which corresponds to a multiscale edge detector. Based on lattice structure factorization, the design of power complementary filter turn out to be unconstrained optimization of lattice coefficients. Adaptive wavelets are designed for five kinds of fabric defects in the experiments. Comparing the proposed method with adaptive wavelet design for defect detection based on orthogonal wavelet transform, our design largely improve the ratio of wavelet transform energy between the defect area and the background, and achieve a robust and accurate detection of fabric defects.

0035359147	Fast motion estimation with search-center prediction	This paper presents a new block-based motion estimation algorithm that employs motion-vector prediction to locate an initial search point, which is called a search center, and an outward spiral search pattern with motion-vector refinement, to speed up the motion estimation process. It is found that the proposed algorithms is only slightly slower than cross search, but has a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) very close to that of full search (FS). Our research shows the motion vector of a target block can be predicted from the motion vectors of its neighboring blocks. The predicted motion vector can be used to locate a search center in the search window. This approach has two distinct merits. First, as the search center is closer to the optimum motion vector, the possibility of finding it is substantially higher. Second, it takes many less search points to achieve this. Results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve 99.7% to 100% of the average PSNR of FS, while it only requires 1.40% to 4.07% of the computation time of FS. When compared with six other fast motion estimation algorithms, it offers the best trade-off between two objective measures: average PSNR and search time.

0035388277	An effective video analysis method for detecting red light runners	This paper presents a novel method for automatic red light runner detection on a video, which is fundamentally different from the concept of conventional red light camera systems. In principle, it extracts the state of the traffic lights and vehicle motions without any physical or electronic interconnections to the traffic light control system or the buried loop detectors. Purely from the video, the new method first constructs a traffic light sequence and then it estimates vehicle motions beyond the stop line while the light is red. In the former, the spatial and temporal relationships of individual traffic lights are utilized. In the latter, the concept of virtual loop detector has been introduced to emulate the physical loop detectors. A prototype was implemented based on this method and was tested in a number of field trials. The results show that the new method is able to detect multiple red light runners in multiple lanes. It is also capable of tolerating a number of hostile but realistic situation such as: 1) minimum number of traffic light; 2) pseudomotions due to shadows; 3) poor contrast; 4) pedestrian motions; and 5) turning vehicles.

The improvement mainly focuses on the similarity matching criteria between the trajectory and the clustered MP whose main advantages are that (1) a reasonable similarity range of MP is automatically calculated instead of manually set; (2) the distance feature and the changing angle feature are considered together for similarity matching while only the distance feature is considered before. The improved method has been implemented and a study of how the new prediction method performs in real world scenario is conducted.

73849089508	Performance evaluation for motif-based patterned texture defect detection	This paper carries an extensive evaluation on the performance of a generalized motif-based method for detecting defects in 16 out of 17 wallpaper groups in 2-D patterned texture. The motif-based method evolves from the concept that every wallpaper group is defined by a lattice, which contains a further constituent-motif. It utilizes the symmetry properties of motifs to calculate the energy of moving subtraction and its variance among motifs. Decision boundaries are determined by learning the distribution of those values among the defect-free and defective patterns in the energy-variance space. In this paper, shape transform for irregular motif has been demonstrated according to the three basic motif shapes: rectangle, triangle, and parallelogram. An error analysis for the misclassifications has also been delivered. In the database of fabrics and other patterned textures, a total of 381 defect-free lattices are used for formulation of boundaries while further 340 defect-free and 233 defective lattices are for testing. The motif-based method has a consistent result and reaches adetection success rate of 93.86%. Note to Practitioners-This paper is motivated by the need to develop a generalized approach that can detect defects on most of the 2-D patterned textures defined so far. It proposes a novel motif-based defect detection method for 16 out of 17 wallpapergroups. A new concept called energy of moving subtraction is defined using norm metric measurement between a collection of circular shift matrices of motif and itself. Together with its variance, an energy-variance space is defined where decision boundaries are drawn for classifying defective and defect-free motifs. The method has been evaluated by two categories of patterned textures. The first category is produced from patterned fabric samples from p2, pmm, p4m, pm, and cm groups. The second category is produced from various patterned texture samples from p4, pg, pmg, cmm, p4g, pgg, p31m, p6, p6m, and p3m1 groups. For the former, a total of 280 defect-free lattices samples are used for deriving the decision boundaries, and further 340 defect-free and 206 defective lattices are used for evaluation. The detection success rate is found to be 93.92%. For the latter, they are the images from painting, tile, ornament, painted porcelain, vessel, earthenware, mat, tapestry, cloth, and wall tiling. A total of 101 defect-free lattices are acquired and 27 defective lattices are used for defect detection. The detection success rate for the second category is 92.59%. An overall detection success rate of 93.86% is achieved for the motif-based method. No other (generalized) approach was able to handle such a large number of wallpaper groups of 2-D patterned textures, and hence this result outperforms all other previously published approaches. This result contributes to the quality assurance of production of textile, wallpaper, ceramics, ornament, and tile. © 2008 IEEE.

75749158448	Scene categorization via contextual visual words	In this paper, we propose a novel scene categorization method based on contextual visual words. In the proposed method, we extend the traditional 'bags of visual words' model by introducing contextual information from the coarser scale and neighborhood regions to the local region of interest based on unsupervised learning. The introduced contextual information provides useful information or cue about the region of interest, which can reduce the ambiguity when employing visual words to represent the local regions. The improved visual words representation of the scene image is capable of enhancing the categorization performance.

76749157891	Ellipsoidal decision regions for motif-based patterned fabric defect detection	This paper presents a study of using ellipsoidal decision regions for motif-based patterned fabric defect detection, the result of which is found to improve the original detection success using max-min decision region of the energy-variance values. In our previous research, max-min decision region was found to be effective in distinct cases but ill detect the ambiguous false-positive and false-negative cases. To alleviate this problem, we first assume that the energy-variance values can be described by a Gaussian mixture model. Second, we apply k-means clustering to roughly identify the various clusters that make up the entire data population. Third, convex hull of each cluster is employed as a basis for fitting an ellipsoidal decision region over it. Defect detection is then based on these ellipsoidal regions. To validate the method, three wallpaper groups are evaluated using the new ellipsoidal regions, and compared with those results obtained using the max-min decision region. For the p2 group, success rate improves from 93.43% to 100%. For the pmm group, success rate improves from 95.9% to 96.72%, while the p4 m group records the same success rate at 90.77%. This demonstrates the superiority of using ellipsoidal decision regions in motif-based defect detection. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77649273644	Extraction of moving objects from their background based on multiple adaptive thresholds and boundary evaluation	The extraction of moving objects from their background is a challenging task in visual surveillance. As a single threshold often fails to resolve ambiguities and correctly segment the object, in this paper, we propose a new method that uses three thresholds to accurately classify pixels as foreground or background. These thresholds are adaptively determined by considering the distributions of differences between the input and background images and are used to generate three boundary sets. These boundary sets are then merged to produce a final boundary set that represents the boundaries of the moving objects. The merging step proceeds by first identifying boundary segment pairs that are significantly inconsistent. Then, for each inconsistent boundary segment pair, its associated curvature, edge response, and shadow index are used as criteria to evaluate the probable location of the true boundary. The resulting boundary is finally refined by estimating the width of the halo-like boundary and referring to the foreground edge map. Experimental results show that the proposed method consistently performs well under different illumination conditions, including indoor, outdoor, moderate, sunny, rainy, and dim cases. By comparing with a ground truth in each case, both the classification error rate and the displacement error indicate an accurate detection, which show substantial improvement in comparison with other existing methods. © 2010 IEEE.

Secondly, we solve the long-time occlusion problem by detecting inter-track relationship and performing track split and merge according to appearance similarity and occlusion order.

79952072338	Scale-adaptive spatial appearance feature density approximation for object tracking	Object tracking is an essential task in visual traffic surveillance. Ideally, a tracker should be able to accurately capture an object's natural motion such as translation, rotation, and scaling. However, it is well known that object appearance varies due to changes in viewing angle, scale, and illumination. They introduce ambiguity to the image cue on which a visual tracker usually relies and which affects the tracking performance. Thus, a robust image appearance cue is required. This paper proposes scale-adaptive spatial appearance feature density approximation to represent objects and construct the image cue. It is found that the appearance representation improves the sensitivity on both the object's rotation and scale. The image cue is then constructed by both the appearance representation of the object and its surrounding background such that distinguishable parts of an object can be tracked under poor imaging conditions. Moreover, tracking dynamics is integrated with the image cue so that objects are efficiently localized in a gradient-based process. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method is effective in capturing the natural motion of objects and generating better tracking accuracy under different image conditions. © 2010 IEEE.

79951468775	A self-growing Bayesian network classifier for online learning of human motion patterns	This paper proposes a new self-growing Bayesian network classifier for online learning of human motion patterns (HMPs) in dynamically changing environments. The proposed classifier is designed to represent HMP classes based on a set of historical trajectories labeled by unsupervised clustering. It then assigns HMP class labels to current trajectories. Parameters of the proposed classifier are recalculated based on the augmented dataset of labeled trajectories and all HMP classes are accordingly updated. As such, the proposed classifier allows current trajectories to form new HMP classes when they are sufficiently different from existing HMP classes. The performance of the proposed classifier is evaluated by a set of real-world data. The results show that the proposed classifier effectively learns new HMP classes from current trajectories in an online manner. © 2010 IEEE.

79952492530	Bayesian 3D model based human detection in crowded scenes using efficient optimization	In this paper, we solve the problem of human detection in crowded scenes using a Bayesian 3D model based method. Human candidates are first nominated by a head detector and a foot detector, then optimization is performed to find the best configuration of the candidates and their corresponding shape models. The solution is obtained by decomposing the mutually related candidates into un-occluded ones and occluded ones in each iteration, and then performing model matching for the un-occluded candidates. To this end, in addition to some obvious clues, we also derive a graph that depicts the inter-object relation so that unreasonable decomposition is avoided. The merit of the proposed optimization procedure is that its computational cost is similar to the greedy optimization methods while its performance is comparable to the global optimization approaches. For model matching, it is performed by employing both prior knowledge and image likelihood, where the priors include the distribution of individual shape models and the restriction on the inter-object distance in real world, and image likelihood is provided by foreground extraction and the edge information. After the model matching, a validation and rejection strategy based on minimum description length is applied to confirm the candidates that have reliable matching results. The proposed method is tested on both the publicly available Caviar dataset and a challenging dataset constructed by ourselves. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2010 IEEE.

0036183707	Novel neighborhood search for multiprocessor scheduling with pipelining	This paper presents a neighborhood search algorithm for heterogeneous multiprocessor scheduling in which loop pipelining is used to exploit parallelism between iterations. The method adopts a realistic model for interprocessor communication where resource contention is taken into consideration. The schedule representation scheme is flexible so that communication scheduling can be performed in a generic manner. Base on a general time formulation of the schedule performance, the algorithm improves an initial schedule in an efficient way by successive modification to the task processor mapping and task ordering. Simulation results show that significant improvement over existing methods can be obtained. A parallel software video encoder was implemented based on the scheduling result and real time performance was achieved with pipelining of frame encoding. © 2001 Elsevier Science.

0035721521	Towards detection of moving cast shadows for visual traffic surveillance	In this paper, an effective method for the detection of moving cast shadow for visual traffic surveillance is proposed. Based on the cast shadow observations in luminance, chrominance, gradient density and geometry domains, a combined probability map, called shadow confidence score, of the region belonging to the shadow is deduced. The object region is then separated from its shadow according to the score. The proposed method has been further tested on images taken under different lighting conditions (sunny and cloudy), viewing angles (roadside and overhead), and vehicle sizes (small, medium and large).

0036612357	Effective moving cast shadow detection for monocular color traffic image sequences	For an accurate scene analysis using monocular color traffic image sequences, a robust segmentation of moving vehicles from the stationary background is generally required. However, the presence of moving cast shadow may lead to an inaccurate vehicle segmentation, and as a result, may lead to further erroneous scene analysis. We propose an effective method for the detection of moving cast shadow. By observing the characteristics of cast shadow in the luminance, chrominance, gradient density, and geometry domains, a combined probability map, called a shadow confidence score (SCS), is obtained. From the edge map of the input image, each edge pixel is examined to determine whether it belongs to the vehicle region based on its neighboring SCCs. The cast shadow is identified as those regions with high SCSs, which are outside the convex hull of the selected vehicle edge pixels. The proposed method is tested on 100 vehicle images taken under different lighting conditions (sunny and cloudy), viewing angles (roadside and overhead), vehicle sizes (small, medium, and large), and colors (similar to the road and not). The results indicate that an average error rate of around 14% is obtained while the lowest error rate is around 3% for large vehicles.

0036444444	Fabric defect classification using wavelet frames and minimum classification error training	This paper proposes a new method for fabric defect classification by incorporating the design of a wavelet frames based feature extractor with the design of an Euclidean distance based classifier. Channel variances at the outputs of the wavelet frame decomposition are used to characterize each nonoverlapping window of the fabric image. A feature extractor using linear transformation matrix is further employed to extract the classification-oriented features. With an Euclidean distance based classifier, each nonoverlapping window of the fabric image is then assigned to its corresponding category. Minimization of the classification error is achieved by incorporating the design of the feature extractor with the design of the classifier based on Minimum Classification Error (MCE) training method. The proposed method has been evaluated on the classification of 329 defect samples containing nine classes of fabric defects, and 328 nondefect samples, where 93.1% classification accuracy has been achieved.

79958101813	A multiple-goal reinforcement learning method for complex vehicle overtaking maneuvers	In this paper, we present a learning method to solve the vehicle overtaking problem, which demands a multitude of abilities from the agent to tackle multiple criteria. To handle this problem, we propose to adopt a multiple-goal reinforcement learning (MGRL) framework as the basis of our solution. By considering seven different goals, either Q-learning (QL) or double-action QL is employed to determine action decisions based on whether the other vehicles interact with the agent for that particular goal. Furthermore, a fusion function is proposed according to the importance of each goal before arriving to an overall but consistent action decision. This offers a powerful approach for dealing with demanding situations such as overtaking, particularly when a number of other vehicles are within the proximity of the agent and are traveling at different and varying speeds. A large number of overtaking cases have been simulated to demonstrate its effectiveness. From the results, it can be concluded that the proposed method is capable of the following: 1) making correct action decisions for overtaking; 2) avoiding collisions with other vehicles; 3) reaching the target at reasonable time; 4) keeping almost steady speed; and 5) maintaining almost steady heading angle. In addition, it should also be noted that the proposed method performs lane keeping well when not overtaking and lane changing effectively when overtaking is in progress. © 2006 IEEE.

79957788287	Automated fabric defect detection-A review	This paper provides a review of automated fabric defect detection methods developed in recent years. Fabric defect detection, as a popular topic in automation, is a necessary and essential step of quality control in the textile manufacturing industry. In categorizing these methods broadly, a major group is regarded as non-motif-based while a minor group is treated as motif-based. Non-motif-based approaches are conventional, whereas the motif-based approach is novel in utilizing motif as a basic manipulation unit. Compared with previously published review papers on fabric inspection, this paper firstly offers an up-to-date survey of different defect detection methods and describes their characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. Secondly, it employs a wider classification of methods and divides them into seven approaches (statistical, spectral, model-based, learning, structural, hybrid, and motif-based) and performs a comparative study across these methods. Thirdly, it also presents a qualitative analysis accompanied by results, including detection success rate for every method it has reviewed. Lastly, insights, synergy and future research directions are discussed. This paper shall benefit researchers and practitioners alike in image processing and computer vision fields in understanding the characteristics of the different defect detection approaches. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79959362533	Adaptive human motion analysis and prediction	Human motion analysis and prediction is an active research area where predicting human motion is often performed for a single time step based on historical motion. In recent years, longer term human motion prediction has been attempted over a number of future time steps. Most current methods learn motion patterns (MPs) from observed trajectories and then use them for prediction. However, these learned MPs may not be indicative due to inadequate observation, which naturally affects the reliability of motion prediction. In this paper, we present an adaptive human motion analysis and prediction method. It adaptively predicts motion based on the classified MPs in terms of their credibility, which refers to how indicative the learned MPs are for the specific environment. The main contributions of the proposed method are as follows: First, it provides a comprehensive description of MPs including not only the learned MPs but also their evaluated credibility. Second, it predicts long-term future motion with reasonable accuracy. A number of experiments have been conducted in simulated scenes and real-world scenes and the prediction results have been quantitatively evaluated. The results show that the proposed method is effective and superior in its performance when compared with a recursively applied Auto-Regressive (AR) model, which is called the Recursive Short-term Predictor (RSP) for long-term prediction. The proposed method has 17.73% of improvement over the RSP in prediction accuracy in the experiment with the best performance. On average, the proposed method has 5% improvement over the RSP in prediction accuracy over 10 experiments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

79960107155	Corner detector based on global and local curvature properties	This paper proposes a curvature-based corner detector that detects both fine and coarse features accurately at low computational cost. First, it extracts contours from a Canny edge map. Second, it computes the absolute value of curvature of each point on a contour at a low scale and regards local maxima of absolute curvature as initial corner candidates. Third, it uses an adaptive curvature threshold to remove round corners from the initial list. Finally, false corners due to quantization noise and trivial details are eliminated by evaluating the angles of corner candidates in a dynamic region of support. The proposed detector was compared with popular corner detectors on planar curves and gray-level images, respectively, in a subjective manner as well as with a feature correspondence test. Results reveal that the proposed detector performs extremely well in both fields. © 2008 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

80155132496	Sub-scene generation: A step towards complex scene understanding	This paper proposes a new method for generating sub-scenes from images of natural scenes. It is based on over-segmented image patches initially and uses rules derived from human psychology to merge the patches into reasonable sub-scenes. This merging process focuses on covering semantic gaps by exploring semantic connections among the patches, such as the influence area of each patch where the potential interaction with other patches may exist; and applying visual organization rules of proximity property and color harmony property. The proposed method is simple yet efficient computationally. It does not have any limitation on the input image class and does not include a training process. Our experiments indicate that it handles complex scenes with clutters and occlusions very well, and outperforms general segmentation methods by its meaningful semantic grouping and self determined stop criteria. © 2011 IEEE.

81055143894	Merging toward natural clusters	To findout how many clusters exist in a sample set is an old yet unsolved problem in unsupervised clustering. This problem inevitably occurs in region merging/growing, a well studied and popular technique in image segmentation. Region merging usually needs a stop criterion. The stop criterion is not automatically determined and often has to be set manually to arrive at a sensible segmentation, which is rather difficult for natural images. To address this problem, we present a robust stop criterion that is based on a novel distinctness predicate for adjacent regions. The predicate discerns distinct regions by examining the evidence of the boundary between neighboring regions. Requiring that every region should be distinct from each other, the proposed method is able to choose a stop point where a natural partition is most likely. Under a region merging framework, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the stop criterion using two merging criterion: one based on optimizing a global functional, and another based on a local criterion. Experimental results and comparison are given at the end. © 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

83655184804	Feature fusion within local region using localized maximum-margin learning for scene categorization	In the field of visual recognition such as scene categorization, representing an image based on the local feature (e.g., the bag-of-visual-word (BOVW) model and the bag-of-contextual-visual-word (BOCVW) model) has become popular and one of the most successful methods. In this paper, we propose a method that uses localized maximum-margin learning to fuse different types of features during the BOCVW modeling for eventual scene classification. The proposed method fuses multiple features at the stage when the best contextual visual word is selected to represent a local region (hard assignment) or the probabilities of the candidate contextual visual words used to represent the unknown region are estimated (soft assignment). The merits of the proposed method are that (1) errors caused by the ambiguity of single feature when assigning local regions to the contextual visual words can be corrected or the probabilities of the candidate contextual visual words used to represent the region can be estimated more accurately; and that (2) it offers a more flexible way in fusing these features through determining the similarity-metric locally by localized maximum-margin learning. The proposed method has been evaluated experimentally and the results indicate its effectiveness. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

84862784934	Three-dimensional model-based human detection in crowded scenes	In this paper, the problem of human detection in crowded scenes is formulated as a maximum a posteriori problem, in which, given a set of candidates, predefined 3-D human shape models are matched with image evidence, provided by foreground extraction and probability of boundary, to estimate the human configuration. The optimal solution is obtained by decomposing the mutually related candidates into unoccluded and occluded ones in each iteration according to a graph description of the candidate relations and then only matching models for the unoccluded candidates. A candidate validation and rejection process based on minimum description length and local occlusion reasoning is carried out after each iteration of model matching. The advantage of the proposed optimization procedure is that its computational cost is much smaller than that of global optimization methods, while its performance is comparable to them. The proposed method achieves a detection rate of about 2% higher on a subset of images of the Caviar data set than the best result reported by previous works. We also demonstrate the performance of the proposed method using another challenging data set. © 2011 IEEE.

0036980303	Discriminative fabric defect detection using adaptive wavelets	We propose a new method for fabric defect detection by incorporating the design of an adaptive wavelet-based feature extractor with the design of an Euclidean distance-based detector. The proposed method characterizes the fabric image with multiscale wavelet features by using undecimated discrete wavelet transforms. Each nonoverlapping window of the fabric image is then detected as defect or nondefect with an Euclidean distance-based detector. Instead of using the standard wavelet bases, an adaptive wavelet basis is designed for the detection of fabric defects. Minimization of the detection error Is achieved by incorporating the design of the adaptive wavelet with the design of the detector parameters using a discriminative feature extraction (DFE) training method. The proposed method has been evaluated on 480 defect samples from five types of defects, and 480 nondefect samples, where a 97.5% detection rate and 0.63% false alarm rate were achieved. The evaluations were also carried out on unknown types of defects, where a 93.3% detection rate and 3.97% false alarm rate were achieved in the detection of 180 defect samples and 780 nondefect samples. © 2002 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

0037278069	A fuzzy controller with supervised learning assisted reinforcement learning algorithm for obstacle avoidance	Fuzzy logic system promises an efficient way for obstacle avoidance. However, it is difficult to maintain the correctness, consistency, and completeness of a fuzzy rule base constructed and tuned by a human expert. Reinforcement learning method is capable of learning the fuzzy rules automatically. However, it incurs heavy learning phase and may result in an insufficiently learned rule base due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a neural fuzzy system with mixed coarse learning and fine learning phases. In the first phase, supervised learning method is used to determine the membership functions for the input and output variables simultaneously. After sufficient training, fine learning is applied which employs reinforcement learning algorithm to fine-tune the membership functions for the output variables. For sufficient learning, a new learning method using modified Sutton and Barto's model is proposed to strengthen the exploration. Through this two-step tuning approach, the mobile robot is able to perform collision-free navigation. To deal with the difficulty in acquiring large amount of training data with high consistency for the supervised learning, we develop a virtual environment (VE) simulator, which is able to provide desktop virtual environment (DVE) and immersive virtual environment (IVE) visualization. Through operating a mobile robot in the virtual environment (DVE/IVE) by a skilled human operator, the training data are readily obtained and used to train the neural fuzzy system.

Instead of using groups of pixels or regular blocks, it uses groups of connected quadrilaterals to represent regions. The proposed method derives the vertices of each quadrilateral from the edge map using the concept of center of masses. By merging the quadrilaterals, regions can be represented. The proposed method offers better data reduction than pixelwise region representation and better boundary approximation than block-based segmentation methods. Experimental results show that it generates a more reasonable region map, which is more suitable for object tracking, and a smaller number of regions than the seeded region growing, K-means clustering, and constrained gravitational clustering methods. © 2002 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

84872512130	Modeling of traffic data characteristics by Dirichlet Process Mixtures	This paper presents a statistical method for modeling large volume of traffic data by Dirichlet Process Mixtures (DPM). Traffic signals are in general defined by their spatial-temporal characteristics, of which some can be common or similar across a set of signals, while a minority of these signals may have characteristics inconsistent with the majority. These are termed outliers. Outlier detection aims to segment and eliminate them in order to improve signal quality. It is accepted that the problem of outlier detection is non-trivial. As traffic signals generally share a high degree of spatial-temporal similarities within the signal and between different types of traffic signals, traditional modeling approaches are ineffective in distinguishing these similarities and discerning their differences. In regard to modeling the traffic data characteristics by DPM, this paper conveys three contributions. First, a new generic statistical model for traffic data is proposed based on DPM. Second, this model achieves an outlier detection rate of 96.74% based on a database of 764,027 vehicles. Third, the proposed model is scalable to the entire road network. © 2012 IEEE.

84873321336	Arm pose modeling for visual surveillance	Arm pose of individual person often indicates his/her behavior and interaction in a crowd. This paper focuses on how to model arm pose with respect to walking styles in visual surveillance. We propose to use a Bayesian network to represent the relationship between the upper arm, forearm and hand. Two sets of probabilistic templates are used to estimate the likelihoods of these three arm parts against their boundary, foreground and skin color features. The prior distributions, a critical part of the Bayesian formulation, are estimated using a kernel density estimator based on the CMU motion dataset, whereby MAP is applied to estimate the part's orientation and size before fitting them to the arms. The proposed method is found to perform effectively on the CAVIAR sub-dataset and a HKU dataset, and compare well against another popular method. Potentially, it can be extended to track arm movements or to analyze the objects carried by individuals.

0042062314	Vehicle feature extraction by patch-based sampling	In modern traffic surveillance, computer vision methods are often employed to detect vehicles of interest because of the rich information content contained in an image. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for extracting the boundary of vehicles free from their moving cast shadows and reflective regions. The extraction method is based on the hypothesis that regions of similar texture are less discriminative, disregarding intensity differences between the vehicle body and the cast shadow or reflection on the vehicle. In this novel algorithm, a united likelihood map that based on the relationship of texture, luminance and chrominance of each pixel is initially constructed. Subsequently, a foreground mask is constructed by applying morphological operations. Vehicles can be successfully extracted and different vehicle components can be efficiently distinguished by the related autocorrelation index within the vehicle mask.

0042098373	Performance evaluation of a feature-preserving filtering algorithm for removing additive random noise in digital images	We evaluate the performance of a feature-preserving filtering algorithm over a range of images corrupted by typical additive random noise against three common spatial filter algorithms: median, sigma and averaging. The concept of the new algorithm is based on a corrupted-pixel identification methodology over a variable subimage size. Rather than processing every pixel indiscriminately in a digital image, this corrupted-pixel identification algorithm interrogates the image in variable-sized subimage regions to determine which are the corrupted pixels and which are not. As a result, only the corrupted pixels are being filtered, whereas the uncorrupted pixels are untouched. Extensive evaluation of the algorithm over a large number of noisy images shows that the corrupted-pixel identification algorithm exhibits three major characteristics. First, its ability in removing additive random noise is better visually (subjective) and has the smallest mean-square errors (objective) in all cases compared with the median filter, averaging filter and sigma filter. Second, the effect of smoothing introduced by the new filter is minimal. In other words, most edge and line sharpness is preserved. Third, the corrupted-pixel identification algorithm is consistently faster than the median and sigma filters in all our test cases. © 1996 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

0042378500	A novel method for handling vehicle occlusion in visual traffic surveillance	This paper presents a novel algorithm for handling occlusion in visual traffic surveillance (VTS) by geometrically splitting the model that has been fitted onto the composite binary vehicle mask of two occluded vehicles. The proposed algorithm consists of a critical points detection step, a critical points clustering step and a model partition step using the vanishing point of the road. The critical points detection step detects the major critical points on the contour of the binary vehicle mask. The critical points clustering step selects the best critical points among the detected critical points as the reference points for the model partition. The model partition step partitions the model by exploiting the information of the vanishing point of the road and the selected critical points. The proposed algorithm was tested on a number of real traffic image sequences, and has demonstrated that it can successfully partition the model that has been fitted onto two occluded vehicles. To evaluate the accuracy, the dimensions of each individual vehicle are estimated based on the partitioned model. The estimation accuracies in vehicle width, length and height are 95.5%, 93.4% and 97.7% respectively.

0041954519	Effective moving cast shadow detection for monocular color image sequences	For an accurate scene analysis in monocular image sequences, a robust segmentation of a moving object from the static background is generally required. However, the existence of moving cast shadow may lead to an inaccurate object segmentation, and as a result, lead to further erroneous scene analysis. An effective detection of moving cast shadow in monocular color image sequences is developed. Firstly, by realizing the various characteristics of shadow in luminance, chrominance, and gradient density, an indicator, called shadow confidence score, of the probability of the region classified as cast shadow is calculated. Secondly the canny edge detector is employed to detect edge pixels in the detected region. These pixels are then bounded by their convex hull, which estimates the position of the object. Lastly, by analyzing the shadow confidence score and the bounding hull, the cast shadow is identified as those regions outside the bounding hull and with high shadow confidence score. A number of typical outdoor scenes are evaluated and it is shown that our method can effectively detect the associated cast shadow from the object of interest. © 2001 IEEE.

To determine the 3-D environment, camera calibration is a crucial step to resolve the relationship between the 3-D world coordinates and their corresponding image coordinates. A novel camera calibration using the geometry properties of road lane markings is proposed. A set of equations that computes the camera parameters from the image coordinates of the road lane markings and lane width is derived. The camera parameters include pan angle, tilt angle, swing angle, focal length, and camera distance. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms the others in terms of accuracy and noise sensitivity. The proposed method accurately determines camera parameters using the appropriate camera model and it is insensitive to perturbation of noise on the calibration pattern.

84904514387	Improve scene categorization via sub-scene recognition	Traditional scene categorization methods tend to generalize representation of the scene via a holistic approach to calculate a distribution of visual words observed in the image. They disregard spatial information within a scene and are not able to discern categories that share similar sub-scenes but different in layout; or categories that are ambiguous by nature. To address this issue, we propose to incorporate sub-scene attributes within global descriptions to improve categorization performance, especially in ambiguity cases. This is achieved by encoding sub-scenes with layout prototypes that capture the geometric essence of scenes more accurately and flexibly. The proposed method improves categorization accuracy to 92.26 % in the widely used eight scenes dataset, and outperforms all the other published methods. It is also observed that the proposed method is more accurate at detecting and evaluating ambiguity images. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84906903295	Enhanced hierarchical conditional random field model for semantic image segmentation	Pairwise and higher order potentials in the Hierarchical Conditional Random Field (HCRF) model play a vital role in smoothing region boundary and extracting actual object contour in the labeling space. However, pairwise potential evaluated by color information has the tendency to over-smooth small regions which are similar to their neighbors in the color space; and the higher order potential associated with multiple segments is prone to produce incorrect guidance to inference, especially for objects having similar features to the background. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes two enhanced potentials in the HCRF model that is capable to abate the over smoothness by propagating the believed labeling from the unary potential and to perform coherent inference by ensuring reliable segment consistency. Experimental results on the MSRC-21 data set demonstrate that the enhanced HCRF model achieves pleasant visual results, as well as significant improvement in terms of both global accuracy of 87.52% and average accuracy of 80.18%, which outperforms other algorithms reported in the literature so far.

84906914743	Action categorization based on arm pose modeling	This paper proposes a novel method to categorize human action based on arm pose modeling. Traditionally, human action categorization relies much on the extracted features from video or images. In this research, we exploit the relationship between action categorization and arm pose modeling, which can be visualized in a probabilistic graphical model. Given visual observations, they can be estimated by maximum a posteriori (MAP) in that arm poses are first estimated under the hypothesis of action category by dynamic programming, and then action category hypothesis is validated by soft-max model based on the estimated arm poses. The prior distribution of each action is estimated by a semi-parametric estimator in advance, and pixel-based dense features including LBP, SIFT, colour-SIFT, and texton are utilized to enhance the likelihood computation by the Joint Adaboosting algorithm. The proposed method has been evaluated on images of walking, waving and jogging from the HumanEva-I dataset. It is found to have arm pose modeling performance better than the method of mixtures of parts, and action categorization success rate of 96.69%.

84907674541	Multiple-human tracking by iterative data association and detection update	Multiple-object tracking is an important task in automated video surveillance. In this paper, we present a multiple-human-tracking approach that takes the single-frame human detection results as input and associates them to form trajectories while improving the original detection results by making use of reliable temporal information in a closed-loop manner. It works by first forming tracklets, from which reliable temporal information is extracted, and then refining the detection responses inside the tracklets, which also improves the accuracy of tracklets' quantities. After this, local conservative tracklet association is performed and reliable temporal information is propagated across tracklets so that more detection responses can be refined. The global tracklet association is done last to resolve association ambiguities. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves both the association and detection results. Comparison with several state-of-the-art approaches demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

First, the performances of the BOCVW models belonging to different features are mutually reinforced by fusing other types of features within local regions. Then, the spatial configuration information is explored using a multi-scale multi-spatial resolution encoding approach. Furthermore, these encoded BOCVW models are globally fused using an improved maximum-margin optimization strategy, which considers the margin between input vectors of different categories and the diameter of the smallest ball containing feature vectors simultaneously. The proposed method has been evaluated on three scene categorization datasets consisting of scene categories 8, 15, and 67, respectively.

10044244736	Curvature scale space corner detector with adaptive threshold and dynamic region of support	Corners play an important role in object identification methods used in machine vision and image processing systems. Single-scale feature detection finds it hard to detect both fine and coarse features at the same time. On the other hand, multi-scale feature detection is inherently able to solve this problem. This paper proposes an improved multi-scale corner detector with dynamic region of support, which is based on Curvature Scale Space (CSS) technique. The proposed detector first uses an adaptive local curvature threshold instead of a single global threshold as in the original and enhanced CSS methods. Second, the angles of corner candidates are checked in a dynamic region of support for eliminating falsely detected corners. The proposed method has been evaluated over a number of images and compared with some popular corner detectors. The results showed that the proposed method offers a robust and effective solution to images containing widely different size features.
