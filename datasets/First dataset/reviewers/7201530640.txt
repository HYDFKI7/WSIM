15944364837	First record of the parasitic barnacle Sacculina scabra Boschma, 1931 (Crustacea: Cirripedia: Rhizocephala) infecting the shallow water swimming crab Charybdis truncata	The shallow water swimming crab Charybdis truncata is occasionally infected by Sacculina species in Hong Kong. Histological sectioning showed that the paired male receptacles are globular in shape and separated from each other. The paired receptacle ducts are united in the middle region and again separated near the duct openings which are light microscopically cuticularized. This species was identified as Sacculina scabra Boschma, 1931, according to the identification key of Boschma (1955). This is the first record of S. scabra since the type specimen was described by Boschma in 1931 in Borneo. © National University of Singapore.

15244356190	Effect of epibiosis on the fitness of the sandy shore snail Batillaria zonalis in Hong Kong	Batillaria zonalis is a common snail on Hong Kong sandy shores, occupying the low-mid shore. Shells of B. zonalis (basibiont) are often fouled with the rock oyster Saccostrea cucullata and the barnacle Balanus reticulatus (epibiont). This epibiotic interaction has a negative impact on the fitness of B. zonalis in terms of impairing fecundity, mobility and metabolism of fouled individuals. During the reproductive season, fouled snails had lower Gonadosomatic Index and fewer egg-bearing individuals than non-fouled snails. Fouled snails crawled in a more tortuous pathway and with lower speed when compared with non-fouled snails. Reduction in oxygen consumption and metabolic rate in fouled snails further suggested the restriction in mobility of B. zonalis by the epibionts. Glycogen content in the foot muscle tissues and hepatopancreas of fouled and non-fouled snails was, however, similar, revealing epibiosis does not influence the energy storage of B. zonalis. Mortality of fouled and non-fouled snails was similar under laboratory conditions, suggesting epibiosis does not influence the survivorship of B. zonalis in Hong Kong. Impairment in the fitness of fouled B. zonalis indicates that epibiosis can influence the population dynamics of B. zonalis in Hong Kong. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

1642442573	Patterns of Biofilm Succession on a Sheltered Rocky Shore in Hong Kong	Successional patterns are dependent on the nature of the substratum, water flow, concentrations of organics as well as the availability of bacteria, algal spores and invertebrate larvae in the coastal environment. Bacteria play an especially important role in biofilm formation as they are generally the earliest colonizers. In the present study, both winter and summer biofilm succession patterns were examined on glass coverslips inverted on experimental racks attached at two tidal levels on a sheltered shore in Hong Kong. In the succession, bacteria were followed by diatoms and cyanobacteria. Encrusting algae appeared in the late stages of the experiment (day 80 in summer and day 60 in winter). Colonization by bacteria was much slower in summer and their density remained low throughout the experimental period. The first appearance of diatoms and cyanobacteria, however, was more rapid in the summer. Bacteria and diatoms on the low-shore surfaces also had a faster succession rate than on the high-shore surfaces, suggesting that desiccation/aerial temperature are the causal factors for such differences.

17044400199	Distribution, adult morphology, and larval development of Sacculina sinensis (Cirripedia: Rhizocephala: Kentrogonida) in Hong Kong coastal waters	Sacculina sinensis (Cirripedia: Rhizocephala) is a parasitic barnacle first reported in Hong Kong by Boschma (1933) to infect the intertidal crab, Leptodius exaratus. Since then, no studies have been conducted to investigate its distribution and morphology, which are important in providing background information for further taxonomic and ecological studies. In the present study, S. sinensis has shown to have a limited distribution in Hong Kong, being confined to only four out of the nine sheltered boulder shores sampled and with a mean infestation rate of 11.3 percent. The localized distribution of S. sinensis in Hong Kong is probably due to its short larval development times (four naupliar stages and one cypris stage, completed in about six days) and hence limited larval dispersal distance. The externa of S. sinensis is ovoid in shape with two distinct shoulders, and the outer cuticle surface is spinous. From histological studies, the male receptacles are located posteriorly in the visceral mass, and each male receptacle is globular in shape. The receptacle duct is folded and connected to the receptacle via a small tube with a thick cuticle lining. The larval morphology of S. sinensis was investigated using a scanning electron microscope. The appendages bear setulate setae in all naupliar stages. In the cyprid, segment III of the antennule consists of the attachment disc in both sexes, and the male has a large posterior aesthetasc which is absent in females. On segment IV, male cyprids have a large terminal aesthetasc, a subterminal aesthetasc, and three terminal setae. Segment IV of female cyprids has a subterminal aesthetasc which is smaller than that on the male cyprids. The larval sex ratio showed seasonal variation with 100 percent males in summer and 80 percent females in winter. Such seasonal variation in sex ratio would allow the female cyprids to infest the host crabs in winter, producing virgin externae by summer for the male cyprids to settle, and allow the externae to mature.

24144452859	Cirral length of the acorn barnacle Tetraclita japonica (Cirripedia: Balanomorpha) in Hong Kong: Effect of wave exposure and tidal height	Tetraclita japonica is a common barnacle in Hong Kong, occupying a wide vertical zonation on exposed to semi-exposed shores. The length of the exopodite of cirri IV-VI of T. japonica varied with different degrees of wave exposure and tidal levels. Barnacles on exposed shores had shorter cirri than those on semi-exposed ones. Barnacles at the low intertidal also had shorter cirri than those at the high intertidal zone. Differences in desiccation and heat stress, the length of the immersion period for feeding, and predation pressure along the tidal gradient may be additional factors affecting the cirral length of T. japonica. Compared with Balanus glandula in temperate waters, the proportional difference in the cirral length of T. japonica between wave-extreme locations is much smaller (4%) than that of B. glandula (80%). Differing from B. glandula, which actively beat their cirri to feed, T. japonica exhibits prolonged extension of the cirri for feeding, which may not favour long cirri even on semi-exposed shores. Barnacles with different cirral activities, therefore, appear to have different degrees of cirral responses to environmental stimulus.

30244505107	A distributed learning model for freshwater ecology practical classes	This paper describes a case study where a distributed learning model was used to enhance the traditional teaching of a freshwater ecology practical class by providing students with a student-centred constructivist environment. Prior to the practical session, a website was created and students were encouraged to think about the morphological adaptations of stream organisms. They were then divided into groups and taken to a real stream to collect specimens and bring them back to the laboratory for further examination and discussion. After the practical, each student group was required to produce a web page concerning the adaptations of the stream organisms to answer a set of online tutorial questions, and to participate in web-based discussion. Feedback by questionnaire showed that the great majority of students enjoyed working with the website and found the content very useful. More than half of the students preferred this type of web-assisted, student-centred practical to conventional practicals, while about a third showed no special preference between the two approaches.

33645076496	Burrow architecture of the ghost crab Ocypode ceratophthalma on a sandy shore in Hong Kong	The ghost crab Ocypode ceratophthalma (Pallas) creates burrows of variety shapes at different ages. Juveniles (mean carapace length 11 mm) produced shallow J-shaped burrows, which incline vertically into the substratum (mean depth 160 mm). Larger crabs (17-25 mm carapace length) have Y-shaped and spiral burrows (mean depth 361 mm). These Y-shaped burrows have a primary arm, which extends to the surface forming the opening, and a secondary arm which terminates in a blind spherical ending. The two arms join in a single shaft and end with a chamber at the base. The secondary arms and chambers are believed to be used for mating or as a refuge from predation. The spiral burrows have spiral single channel ending in a chamber. Older crabs (mean carapace length 32.6 mm) had simple, straight single tube burrows, which inclined into the substratum at mean of 73° and had a mean depth of 320 mm. During summer daytime periods, the burrows shelter the crabs from heat and desiccation stress. The sand surface temperature at the burrow opening was ∼48°C but temperatures inside the burrows can drop to 32°C at a depth of 250 mm. Variation in the burrow architecture with crab age appears to be related to the crab's behaviour. Juvenile crabs have smaller gill areas and move out of the burrows regularly to renew their respiratory water and, as a result, they do not need a deep burrow. Larger crabs, in contrast, can tolerate prolonged periods without renewing their respiratory water and therefore create deeper and more complex burrows for mating and refuges. © Springer 2006.

33846438181	Morphological and genetic differentiation of the acorn barnacle Tetraclita squamosa (Crustacea, Cirripedia) in East Asia and description of a new species of Tetraclita	The common intertidal barnacle Tetraclita squamosa occurs in two morphologically and genetically distinct forms in East Asia. The north-western Pacific form (Japan, Okinawa and Taiwan) has green parietes and the tergo-scutal flaps are black without any patterns. The south China form (Xiamen, Hong Kong) also has green parietes but the tergo-scutal flaps are black with two white spots on the tergal and scutal margin. Compared to the NW Pacific form, the south China form has a beaked tergum, a sharper tergal spur and cirrus I lacks serrulate type setae that have four rows of setules. The two forms differ by 15-16% in COI divergence, which is comparable to values for other congeneric barnacle species. The 12S rRNA and ITS1 sequences are also distinct between the two forms. Our results support the conclusion that the two forms are genetically differentiated species. We describe the NW Pacific form as a new species, Tetraclita pacifica. We are treating the other species as Tetraclita squamosa based on the fact that Pilsbry, in 1916, redescribed T. squamosa squamosa using samples collected from south China and the Philippines. Further studies are needed to confirm the identity and geographical distribution of the 'widely distributed' T. squamosa in the Indo-West Pacific. © 2007 The Authors.

33846524928	Summer mortality: Effects on the distribution and abundance of the acorn barnacle Tetraclita japonica on tropical shores	In the Hong Kong rocky intertidal, the demography of the acorn barnacle Tetraclita japonica is largely determined by regular, intense mortality events in the summer and subsequent pulses of recruitment in late summer. During 2 consecutive summers from 2000 to 2001, 34 to 52 and 98 to 99% of T. japonica were killed on the mid- and high shore, respectively, with younger cohorts suffering higher mortality in the mid-shore. Recruitment of T. japonica occurs in late summer; as a result, the population in the high shore consists of a single cohort of new recruits, while the mid-shore supports 2 cohorts (new recruits and adult survivors). To investigate how thermal stress affects acorn barnacle populations, air and rock temperatures and sub-lethal physiological measures (body temperature, sinus pulsation rate and haemolymph osmolality) of T. japonica were taken on the mid- and high shore during daytime, low spring tides in June-July 2001. Mean body temperature increased gradually after emersion, reaching a maximum of ∼48°C at noon, 6 to 8°C higher than the adjacent rock surface. T. japonica entered a heat-induced coma when body temperatures reached 45°C. Osmolality of the haemolymph and sinus pulsation rate increased with body temperature as a result of water loss and possibly altered haemolymph pressure; both were greater in high than in mid-shore individuals, with barnacles on horizontal surfaces being hotter than those on vertical surfaces. Body temperature and sinus pulsation rate differed between shore levels, but were similar at spatial scales of 1 to 20 m at the same tidal height. Haemolymph osmolality, however, varied over this distance, probably due to individual variation in the amount of mantle water trapped before emersion and possible micro-habitat differences. Heat and desiccation stress, therefore, play an important role in determining the life history of T. japonica by limiting their distribution and abundance and influencing the demography of the population at different spatial scales. © Inter-Research 2006.

In the present study, we try to elucidate the taxonomic status of the two taxa using morphology and mitochondrial control region and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences of the barnacles in their distribution range. The two taxa were found to be morphologically similar; a diagnostic difference between them was only observed in the colour of the parietes and opercular plates.

34547531185	Antennular morphology of the cypris larvae of the mangrove barnacle Fistulobalanus albicostatus (Cirripedia: Thoracica: Balanomorpha)	Previous studies on the ultrastructure of barnacle cypris larvae suggest that cypris morphology, especially the antennules which play a key role in selecting the final substratum for settlement, may show variations between species existing in different habitats. In the present study, the cypris morphology of the barnacle Fistulobalanus (Balanus) albicostatus, which predominantly lives on trunks of mangrove trees was investigated using scanning electron microscopy and compared with that of species from other habitats that have already been described. The antennular segments II and III of F. albicostatus each bear one post-axial seta. The third segment consists of an attachment disc surrounded by a thin cuticular velum and the fourth segment exhibits four sub-terminal setae and five terminal setae. The morphology of the cypris antennules of F. albicostatus is similar to other balanomorph barnacles which inhabit hard shores, revealing that the antennular morphology does not have diagnostic variations between species from the different intertidal habitats. The morphology of the caudal rami (used in the evaluation of the substratum microtopography), however, appears to vary among barnacles living on different substrata.

34547613219	Taxonomic revision of the acorn barnacles Tetraclita japonica and Tetraclita formosana (Crustacea: Cirripedia) in East Asia based on molecular and morphological analyses	Common acorn barnacles of the genus Tetraclita exhibit high levels of morphological variations that have led to taxonomic confusion. In East Asia, Tetraclita japonica (Pilsbry, 1916) occurs in grey or purple forms while Tetraclita formosana (Hiro, 1939) is pink. However, recent studies revealed that the two taxa do not exhibit variations in the mitochondrial COI and control region sequences, suggesting that their species status is questionable and whether they should be treated as species, subspecies or color morphotypes is equivocal. In the present study, we found no significant genetic differentiation between T. formosana and T. japonica in the highly polymorphic control region and the two taxa also share common nuclear ITS1 genotypes. This suggests there is no evidence for reproductive isolation between T. japonica and T. formosana. The two taxa share similar arthropodal and opercular morphologies; the only difference between them is in the color of the parietes. The purple and grey forms of T. japonica co-exist in high abundance in Honshu, Japan. On the geographical scale, T. japonica dominates the shores in Honshu, Japan, and along the coast of southern China whereas it is very rare in Taiwan and Okinawa. In contrast, T. formosana (pink) is very abundant in Taiwan and Okinawa but absent from southern China and rare in Honshu, Japan. We interpret the nearly allopatric distribution, phenotypic differences in parietes color and insignificant genetic differences between T. japonica and T. formosana as indicative of the subspecies status of the taxa, namely Tetraclita japonica japonica and Tetraclita japonica formosana. © 2007 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.

34547628857	Cryptic diversity of the Tetraclita squamosa complex (crustacea: Cirripedia) in Asia: Description of a new species from Singapore	Tetraclita squamosa is a common intertidal barnacle of the Indo-Pacific. Taxonomic classification of T. squamosa has been confused by its high degree of morphological variation, and it is now considered to be a species complex. Tetraclita squamosa collected from Singapore exhibits diagnostic morphological and genetic differences compared to T. squamosa from the coast of southern China and T. kuroshioensis in the northwestern Pacific (a recently described species formerly recognized as T. squamosa). Tetraclita squamosa from Singapore has a long tergal margin in the scutum and a very straight scutal margin in the tergum when compared to T. kuroshioensis and T. squamosa from southern China. The setae on the cirri of T. squamosa from Singapore are similar to those of T. squamosa from southern China. Barnacles from Singapore and southern China differ from T. kuroshioensis in lacking serrulate setae with 4 rows of setules on cirrus I. From a molecular analysis, T. squamosa from Singapore is differentiated from T. squamosa from southern China, and T. kuroshioensis by more than 19%, 10%, and 11% divergences in the COI, 12S rRNA, and ITS1 sequences, respectively. These values are much higher than those within each taxon (< 1.5% in the most variable COI sequence), revealing that they are genetically distinct. The clear genetic and morphological differences from both T. squamosa and T. kuroshioensis indicate that T. squamosa from Singapore represents a new species of Tetraclita. Tetraclita squamosa in the Indo-West Pacific region is a cryptic species complex with high morphological and genetic diversity. Given the relatively restricted areas investigated to the present, it is likely that more species await discovery in Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Indian Ocean. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/46.1/46.pdf.

39749189049	First report of antennular attachment organs in a barnacle nauplius larva	Larvae released from Newmaniverruca albatrossiana were cultured in the laboratory until the cypris stage. The brood size of individuals was low, about 60 larvae per brood. The exact number of instars was not determined. Early instars had the morphology normally seen in lecithotrophic nauplii of thoracican cirripedes. They had uniramous antennules with a few apical setae and biramous antennae and mandibles equipped with natatory setae only. Neither antennae nor mandibles carried any enditic spines or setae and the mouth cone was diminutive. The last nauplius stage obtained in our cultures was typical except in the structure of antennules. The head shield was enlarged but not flexed down, the antennae and mandibles were virtually unchanged from earlier instars, and the ventral thoracic process was well developed but without any external appendages. In contrast, the antennules had the complex shape and segmentation otherwise seen only in cypris larvae, where they are used for bipedal walking on the substratum in search of a settlement site. The similarity included the specialized shape of the first two antennular segments and the specialization of the third as an attachment organ. Nauplii just prior to this last instar had simple, straight antennules but completely lacked setae and instead terminated bluntly in what appears to be an incipient attachment organ. The presence of cypris-like antennules in late nauplii has not previously been recorded in cirripedes. We suggest that this will allow the larvae to attach on the substratum temporarily before they reach the cypris instar and this will increase the chance of settling successfully on their rare substratum (sea urchin spines). The specialization in late N. albatrossiana nauplii will therefore decrease mortality during the larval phase and thus counterbalance the very low breeding potential in this deep-sea species. © 2008 The Authors.

39049133790	Bioluminescent emissions of the deep-water pandalid shrimp, Heterocarpus sibogae de Man, 1917 (Decapoda, Caridea, Pandalidae) under laboratory conditions	Bioluminescent behaviour of deep-sea decapods is difficult to study under long-term laboratory maintenance, because most deep-sea organisms suffer from high mortality in such conditions. The objective of the present study was to determine the survival of the deep-water pandalid shrimp, Heterocarpus sibogae De Man, 1917 and its ability to produce bioluminescence when maintained in the laboratory. H. sibogae exhibited bioluminescence by emitting two streams of blue luminous secretions from the mouth when disturbed. The luminous material decayed rapidly and disappeared in seconds. Shrimps retreated from the luminous region immediately after secretion, suggesting that bioluminescence is a defence response. Under laboratory conditions, H. sibogae can produce luminous secretions for at least 43 days of maintenance. Maximum emission time was recorded in a non-ovigerous female that reached 634 seconds. Males and non-ovigerous females showed a similar average emission time of about 30 seconds. Ovigerous females, however, produced significantly longer emissions with an average of 103 seconds, suggesting that these may contain larger amounts of the key chemical for bioluminescence, coelenterazine, than males and non-ovigerous females do. © 2008 Brill Academic Publishers.

31844433483	Reproductive development of the barnacle Chthamalus malayensis in Hong Kong: Implications for the life-history patterns of barnacles on seasonal, tropical shores	Hong Kong, lying just below the Tropic of Cancer (22°17′N, 114°09′E), experiences a strongly seasonal environment, with a cool almost temperate winter and a hot, tropical, summer. Histological sectioning of the gonads of the high-shore barnacle, Chthamalus malayensis Pilsbry, showed a seasonal trend in the development of its reproductive organs. Four stages of female gonad development were identified according to the cell types present: post-spawning, resting, growth and mature stages. The female gonad was mature from April to November, which was related to seawater temperatures, and entered a resting phase from December to March. Although the male gonad showed a seasonal developmental trend and reached maximum maturity in summer, the seminal vesicles were full of spermatozoa and functional throughout the year. The reproductive season of this species is therefore solely dependant upon the maturity of the female gonad. The estimated maximum number of broods per year was up to 10 and the maximum number of eggs produced per brood can reach 3,000 eggs. The minimum size for female gonad maturity was 6 mm rostro-carinal diameter (RCD) at which size, the barnacles were ∼6-month old. Sperm production occurred at a smaller size (2 mm = 2-month old). Compared with Chthamalus montagui and Chthamalus stellatus from temperate regions, C. malayensis produced a greater number of broods per year, had a longer reproductive period and faster gonad development. Chthamaloid barnacles in tropical regions may, therefore, invest more energy per year in reproduction during their life span. Contrary to the seasonal gonad developmental pattern of C. malayensis in the present study, however, C. malayensis in Singapore (which experiences only slight seasonal variation) had mature female and male gonads throughout the year, further supporting the strong role of climatic conditions effecting the reproductive biology of barnacles. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

60549104611	Antennular sensory organs in cyprids of balanomorphan cirripedes: Standardizing terminology using Megabalanus rosa	Cirripedes are one of the major groups of fouling organism in the marine environment. The cyprid can, before a permanent attachment, actively explore and walk on the substratum using its antennules in a bipedal fashion without leaving the surface. Studying the structure of the cyprid antennule is therefore important for understanding the events that culminate in biofouling by barnacles. There are at present no complete, standardised accounts of the structure of the cyprid antennules in thoracican barnacles, and moreover, the existing accounts vary in their use of terminology. This article describes the cyprid antennule of the barnacle Megabalanus rosa. This barnacle species is common in E Asia, and the cyprids have previously been used in several biofouling studies. All externally visible setae on the antennules have been mapped; these comprise both chemosensors with a terminal pore, a putative aesthetasc-like seta and mechano-sensory setae. More setae were found on the attachment disc than in previous scanning electron microscope-based studies, but not all structures that can be seen with transmission electron microscopy were visible. The disc itself seems to have a variable surface area, which could assist in exploring rough surfaces. The various lengths of the antennular setae, coupled with the disposition of the segments, enable the cyprid to cover a wide swath of substratum during exploratory walking. A new terminology is proposed for cyprid antennular setae, which will form a basis for future comparative and functional studies of cirripede settlement. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

0034980277	The effect of salinity and recruitment on the distribution of Tetraclita squamosa and Tetraclita japonica (Cirripedia; Balanomorpha) in Hong Kong	The barnacles, Tetraclita squamosa and Tetraclita japonica, exhibit different vertical and horizontal distributions along the salinity gradient from the east to west coast of Hong Kong. On the oceanic east coast, T. japonica was common higher on the shore [1.25-2 m above chart datum (C.D.)] than T. squamosa (1-1.25 m above C.D.), whereas on the estuarine west coast, only T. squamosa was found. Annual recruitment of both species occurred on the east coast but no recruitment was recorded on the west coast for 2 years, suggesting that west coast populations of T. squamosa are relics of stochastic, past recruitment, and may decline without further recruitment. Under laboratory conditions, the two species do not vary in their salinity tolerance or osmoregulation. Adults of both species ceased activity when salinity dropped to 10‰ (= mean summer salinity on west coast). The LC

80052655342	Influence of environmental factors on the abundance of Anopheles farauti larvae in large brackish water streams in Northern Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands	Background: The main vector of malaria in Solomon Islands is Anopheles farauti, which has a mainly coastal distribution. In Northern Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, high densities of An. farauti are supported by large brackish streams, which in the dry season are dammed by localized sand migration. The factors controlling the high larval productivity of these breeding sites have not been identified. Accordingly the influence of environmental factors on the presence and density of An. farauti larvae was assessed in three large naturally dammed streams. Methods. Larval sites were mapped and anopheline larvae were collected monthly for 12 months (July 2007 to June 2008) from three streams using standard dippers. Larval collections were made from 10 locations spaced at 50 m intervals along the edge of each stream starting from the coast. At each collection point, floating filamentous algae, aquatic emergent plants, sun exposure, and salinity were measured. These environmental parameters along with rainfall were correlated with larval presence and density. Results: The presence and abundance of An. farauti larvae varied between streams and was influenced by the month of collection, and distance from the ocean (p < 0.001). Larvae were more frequently present and more abundant within 50 m of the ocean during the dry season when the streams were dammed. The presence and density of larvae were positively associated with aquatic emergent plants (presence: p = 0.049; density: p = 0.001). Although filamentous algae did not influence the presence of larvae, this factor did significantly influence the density of larvae (p < 0.001). Rainfall for the month prior to sampling was negatively associated with both larval presence and abundance (p < 0.001), as high rainfall flushed larvae from the streams. Salinity significantly influenced both the presence (p = 0.002) and density (p = 0.014) of larvae, with larvae being most present and abundant in brackish water at < 10 seawater. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that the presence and abundance An. farauti larvae are influenced by environmental factors within the large streams. Understanding these parameters will allow for targeted cost effective implementation of source reduction and larviciding to support the frontline malaria control measures i.e. indoor residual spraying (IRS) and distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). © 2011 Bugoro et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Studies of specimens from the Hong Kong type locality and adjacent areas of China, Taiwan and Vietnam show that U. splendida is a valid species, with a characteristic suite of carapace and gonopod features as well as a distinct cytochrome oxidase I (COI) signature. Genetic work shows that U. splendida belongs to a well-supported clade and is the sister species of U. crassipes. The distribution of U. splendida is restricted to continental East and continental Southeast Asia, in contrast to the oceanic distribution of U. crassipes. Both species, however, are sympatric in Penghu Islands, western Taiwan and Dongsha Island (=Pratas Island). Copyright © 2012 Magnolia Press.

41749103769	Burrow morphology and dynamics of mudshrimp in Asian soft shores	Mudshrimps are important soft shore bioturbators but research on the ecology of tropical species has received less attention when compared with their temperate counterparts. The mudshrimp Austinogebia edulis is common on Asian soft shores and lives in burrows for its entire adult life. Epoxy resin casting of A. edulis burrows showed that they were approximately Y-shaped, with an upper U-part and the lower central shaft part. The burrows had two openings extending to the surface; the mean distance between the two openings was 11.0 cm in Hong Kong and 26.4 cm in Taiwan. Openings of the burrows had small chimneys. The tunnels of the burrows were circular, narrow and with a smooth surface (tunnel diameter corresponded to shrimp carapace width). Each burrow was inhabited by a single shrimp and burrows were inter-connected during the mating and reproductive season. Each burrow had four to 12 spherical chambers, which were free of detritus. The chambers were thought to be used for suspension feeding, current generation and as turning points. The depth of burrows was up to 1.1 m. Multivariate analysis on various burrow parameters showed that burrows collected on a mud flat in Taiwan were deeper, had a wider distance between the openings and a larger volume than burrows collected from a sandy shore in Hong Kong, suggesting that burrow architecture is variable between shore types. Burrow architecture, however, did not vary between tidal levels, seasons and shrimp density on the shores in Hong Kong, indicating that the burrows were quite stable within the substratum and were not affected by environmental and biological factors. © 2008 The Authors.

47349102656	Setal morphology and cirral setation of thoracican barnacle cirri: Adaptations and implications for thoracican evolution	Thoracic cirripedes are sessile crustaceans that use six pairs of thoracic appendages (the cirri) to catch and handle food. We used scanning electron microscopy to examine the cirri, which include one to three pairs of maxillipeds in six species of thoracican barnacles, in search of correlations between cirral setation and feeding mode. The species studied comprise both pedunculate and sessile forms and represent a wide range of marine habitats as well as morphologies, viz., Ibla cumingi, Octolasmis warwickii, Capitulum mitella, Pollicipes polymerus, Tetraclita japonica japonica and Megabalanus volcano. Of the pedunculates, I. cumingi has the least complex setation pattern consisting of only serrulate types. This is consistent with its very simplified feeding mode and an apparent inability to discriminate between food items. Octolasmis warwickii is slightly more modified, while both P. polymerus and C. mitella have a more diversified setation. The balanomorphan species exhibit by far the most complex cirral setation. This is consistent with the several types of suspension feeding seen in these species, their ability to identify and sort captured food items and even to perform microfiltration in the mantle cavity using the setae on their three pairs of maxillipeds. Our results indicate that in thoracican barnacles, adaptations in feeding behaviour are associated with changes in the setation pattern of the cirri. In addition, the setal types and their distribution on the cirri are potential new characters in future morphology-based analyses of the phylogeny of the Cirripedia Thoracica. © 2008 The Authors.

47949097685	Latitudinal gradient in the distribution of intertidal barnacles of the Tetraclita species complex in Asian waters	Barnacles are a major space occupier in the intertidal zone and are good model organisms to study the biogeography of intertidal invertebrates. In the present study, we used quantitative transect sampling to study the geographical distribution of the common rocky shore barnacles Tetraclita kuroshioensis, T. squamosa, T. japonica japonica and T. j. formosana at 19 sites covering the 3 large Asian marine ecosystems (Kuroshio Current, East China Sea and South China Sea) from 22° 20' to 35°00'N. Tetraclita spp. showed spatial variations in geographical distribution. Species assemblages of >60% similarity can be grouped into 4 distinct regions. On the Pacific coast of Japan T. j. japonica, T. j. formosana and T. kuroshioensis co-existed at the same tidal level, with T. j. japonica at the highest abundance. In North Taiwan and Okinawa T. kuroshioensis and T. j. formosana were common. In East Taiwan, T. j. formosana was the dominant species and T. kuroshioensis occurred in low abundance. In South China, T. squamosa and T. j. japonica were found, but they occupied different tidal levels. T. j, formosana and T. kuroshioensis were abundant in West Pacific waters, suggesting that their larval pool is associated with the Kuroshio Current. T. squamosa was distributed along the South China coast and it is possible that their larvae were transported mainly by the South China Sea Surface Current. T. j. japonica had high abundance in both Japan and South China, but with very low abundance at the Pacific shores between these 2 locations. There may be a physical and genetic boundary between the northern and southern populations in the Pacific Ocean and further studies of Tetraclita spp. in the Asian region should focus on population genetics. © Inter-Research 2008.

49749138908	Adaptations to barnacle fouling in the mangroves Kandelia obovata and Aegiceras corniculatum	Mangrove trees planted for restoration or rehabilitation often fail to show satisfactory survivals. Although it is generally assumed that barnacle fouling is a factor in mangrove mortality, the sub-lethal response of mangroves to this fouling is not known. In the present study, we compare the leaf morphology (stomata density, leaf thickness, percentage thickness of palisade layer and number of hypodermal layers), lenticel density and the plant fitness (number of flowers or droppers per tree) between mangroves fouled by the acorn barnacle Fistulobalanus albicostatus (the fouled group, number of barnacles ~ 120 individuals per tree) and non-fouled mangroves (the control group). We observed 55 Kandelia obovata from three locations, two in Hong Kong (n = 35, fouled 25 and control 10) and one location in Taiwan (n = 20, fouled 10 and control 10). Aegiceras corniculatum (n = 45) was observed from two sites in Hong Kong, one on the east coast (n = 20, 10/10) and one on the west coast (n = 25, 10/15). In seedlings (K. obovata n = 10, 5/5), fouling density did not affect leaf morphology. In mature trees, however, leaves from fouled trees had significantly higher density of stomata and stem lenticel, a lower percentage thickness of leaf palisade layer and more layers of lower hypodermis in the leaves, probably for compensating the impeded gaseous exchange functions of the lenticels. The number of droppers and flowers on fouled mangroves was significantly lower. It is possible that after compensating for respiratory stress, the plant had less energy available for reproduction. Although there was no obvious barnacle-induced mortality in this study, barnacles appear to be related to a reduction in plant fitness. This may induce sufficient stress that over time fouled mangroves cannot sustain viable populations. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

51649125913	Genetic differentiation, hybridization and adaptive divergence in two subspecies of the acorn barnacle Tetraclita japonica in the northwestern Pacific	Two acorn barnacles, Tetraclita japonica japonica and Tetraclita japonica formosana, have been recently reclassified as two subspecies, because they are morphologically similar and genetically indistinguishable in mitochondrial DNA sequences. The two barnacles are distinguishable by parietes colour and exhibit parapatric distributions, coexisting in Japan, where T. j. formosana is very low in abundance. Here we investigated the genetic differentiation between the subspecies using 209 polymorphic amplified fragment length polymorphism markers and 341 individuals from 12 locations.

50149086070	Population differentiation in the barnacle Chthamalus malayensis: Postglacial colonization and recent connectivity across the Pacific and Indian Oceans	Chthamalus malayensis is a common intertidal acorn barnacle widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific. Analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences of samples from its distribution range revealed 3 genetically differentiated clades: the South China Sea, Indo-Malay and Taiwan clades. The clades have an allopatric distribution and differed by ∼7.5 to 14% in COI. They also differed in zonation patterns and abundances within vertical ranges. The genetic and ecological differences suggest that the 3 clades probably represent distinct species. There were signatures of postglacial demographic expansion, yet the timing of expansion varied among clades, which is attributable to the differences in their geographical distributions. The Indian Ocean population of the Indo-Malay clade apparently attained its present range by postglacial re-colonization from the Pacific and, as a result, genetic differentiation among populations in the 2 oceans is low (Φ

53649109973	Morphological variation and biogeography of an insular intertidal barnacle hexechamaesipho pilsbryi (Crustacea: Cirripedia) in the western Pacific	Hexechamaesipho pilsbryi (Hiro, 1936) is a high shore barnacle discovered by F. Hiro in Honshu, Japan in 1936. In the northwest Pacific, H. pilsbryi was found from Honshu to Taiwan but not along the mainland coast of China, suggesting it is an insular species and the biogeography is influenced by the Kuroshio Current. Hexechamaesipho pilsbryi had not been previously reported in Taiwan, so there may have been a distribution extension. Mean abundance (> 80% cover) and cohort numbers (> 3) of H. pilsbryi were higher in Okinawa than in Honshu and Taiwan (< 50% cover, < 3 cohorts), suggesting that the Honshu and Taiwan populations may be derived from the Okinawa population. The decreased adult density in Honshu and Taiwan may be due to a reduced larval supply, harsher environment outside Okinawa waters, or the result of competition/predation interactions. Both H. pilsbryi and Nesochthamalus intertextus (Darwin, 1854) appear to be adapted to a subtropical climate zone, bridging the "Japan region" and the "Indo-Polynesian province" proposed by Briggs (1974). The shape of the tergum and mandibles of H. pilsbryi is variable. From SEM studies, the setae on the cirri and mouth parts have a con sistently similar form throughout the presently known geographical range of H. pilsbryi. Cirrus II invariably carries multicuspidate setae (= card setae or grapples), supporting the repositioning of this species from the sub-family Chthamalinae to the sub-family Notochthamalinae by Poltarukha (1996). © 2008 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.

57649217856	Barnacle fouling impedes the gaseous exchange and food production of the mangroves Kandelia obovata, a dominant mangrove species in Hong Kong and Taiwan	Barnacle fouling has shown to impede gas exchange ability of mangroves. Fouled mangrove plants may therefore obtain less carbon dioxide and water for photosynthesis, resulting in reduced food and chloroplasts production, but such hypothesis remains untested. The objective of the present study compared the stomata density (essential for obtaining carbon dioxide and water molecules) and leaf chlorophyll concentration (essential for photosynthesis) of fouled and non-fouled (control) of seedlings, juveniles and adults of the mangroves Kandelia obovata, in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The seedlings and juveniles of the dominant mangrove plant species, Kandelia obovata, in Hong Kong and Taiwan had a higher density of stomata but a lower chlorophyll concentration in the leaves, when the trunks and twigs were fouled by the barnacle Fistulobalanus albicostatus. Fouled K. obovata appears to develop more stomata in the leaves to compensate the blocking effect of the lenticel from barnacle fouling. As fouling impacts the gaseous exchange ability of mangroves, fouled plants could obtain less carbon dioxide and water for photosynthesis, resulting in reduced food and chloroplasts production. Fouled adult plants, however, had variable responses in leaf chlorophyll concentrations among the study sites, suggesting adults were more tolerant of barnacle fouling. The present study reveals seedling and juvenile mangrove plants are very susceptible to barnacle fouling, which impedes the gaseous exchange mechanism and food production, which can subsequently result in reduced growth, fitness and survival. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

58149269336	Fluctuating asymmetry of Amphibalanus (Balanus) amphitrite (Cirripedia: Thoracica) in association with shore height and metal pollution	The level of fluctuating asymmetry (FA), which is defined as random deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry in the morphological traits of an organism, increases with increasing developmental instability, and it may be used as an indicator of environmental and/or genetic stresses. This study attempted to relate FA levels in the opercular plates of the barnacle Amphibalanus (Balanus) amphitrite with shore height and body trace metal concentrations. Barnacles were collected from both low and mid shores at six coastal locations with various degrees of marine pollution in Hong Kong. Four opercular traits, namely scutum length, tergum length, scutum width, tergum width were measured in the specimen while concentrations of five common trace metals (Cd, Cu, Cr, Mn and Zn) were determined in their body tissues using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrophotometry. Among the four traits, only tergum length and scutum width fulfilled the assumption of FA while their measurement errors were low. Across all sites, mid-shore A. amphitrite consistently exhibited a significantly higher FA level in scutum width than that in low-shore barnacles, but FA levels in tergum length were similar between the two shore heights. These results suggested that FA was trait-dependent, and mid-shore barnacles were possibly under high physical stress, such as desiccation and high temperature, leading to high developmental instability. Although no positive association was observed between FA and metal contamination in low-shore A. amphitrite, FA level in tergum length significantly increased with decreasing body concentration of manganese (Mn) in these barnacles. Such a negative relationship may be explained by the mechanism of bioaccumulation and physiological role of Mn in A. amphitrite with respect to the formation of barnacle shell plates. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

62849096598	Host-associated speciation in the coral barnacle Wanella milleporae (Cirripedia: Pyrgomatidae) inhabiting the Millepora coral	Speciation by host shift is a common phenomenon observed in many symbiotic animals. The symbiont-host interaction is highly dynamic, but it is poorly documented in the marine realm. In the present study, we examined the genetic and morphological differentiation of the coral barnacle Wanella milleporae (obligate to fire corals) collected from four different Millepora host species in Taiwan to investigate the host specificity of this barnacle. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial COI gene for 241 individuals of Wanella revealed five distinct clades, whose sequence divergences are comparable to values between other cogeneric barnacle species. The five clades also differ in shell and opercular plate morphology and colour. Genetic and morphological differentiations together strongly suggest the presence of cryptic species. Although the five clades do not display species-level host specificity, they showed a significant difference in preference on host growth form. Clades 1 and 2 were predominantly found on encrusting Millepora exaesa and Millepora platyphylla, while clades 3, 4 and 5 live exclusively on branching-form fire corals Millepora dichotoma and Millepora tenella. Phylogeny inferred from the combined mitochondrial COI, 16S and 12S (2182 bp) analysis suggests the division of the five clades into two major lineages congruent with the morphology of the host coral. Multiple independent invasions to the same form of host and subsequent speciation are evident in the Red Sea and Taiwan. Our results indicate that ecological/sympatric speciation could occur in marine symbiotic invertebrates through host shift and specialization. It appears that, as in their terrestrial counterparts, host-symbiont radiations in the marine realm are more prevalent than we expected and thus warrant further investigation. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

64249138205	Morphology and distribution of the acorn barnacle Tetraclita reni nom. nov. (Crustacea: Cirripedia) in Madagascar and adjacent waters	In Madagascan waters, both Tetraclita rufotincta Pilsbry 1916 and T. africana Ren 1989 have been reported. Tetraclita rufotincta is more widely distributed than T. africana, extending to the western Indian Ocean and east Africa, Tetraclita africana is reported from Madagascar and no further distribution record has been made apart from its type locality. Both species have pink parietes and are similar in size, which could lead to identification confusion. In this study, we revealed that T. africana differed from T. rufotincta in having multicuspidate setae on cirrus III, a feature that can be observed with both light microscopy and SEM. Additionally, the tergum of T. africana has a rounded spur and a larger basi-scutal angle than that of T. rufotincta. However, since the name Tetraclita africana has been pre-occupied under the name Tesseropora (Tetraclita) wireni africana Nilsson-Cantell, 1932, we, therefore, propose herein a replacement name, Tetraclita reni nom. nov. Based on museum specimens examined, Tetraclita reni nom. nov. is present in northeastern and southern Madagascar and Mauritius but absent from Yemen, Kenya, South Africa, Aldabra and northwestern Madagascar, suggesting the distribution of T. reni nom. nov. could be confined to the south and northeast of Madagascar and adjacent waters.

The microdistribution indicates the different requirements of the two species. In the present study, both arthropodal and opercular plate characters of these two species were investigated using SEM techniques. Morphologically, C. hoegi is close to C. pallidas. However, the tergal scutal margins of C. pallidas are curved, whilst those of C. hoegi are straight, and its spur is narrower than that of C. pallidas. The apex of the scutum and tergum of C. hoegi forms a honeycomb-like surface, most probably the 'imprint' of the chitinous primordial valves. The separation of C. hoegi from C. pallidas is also supported by molecular analyses of three mitochondrial gene sequences (COI, 16S, and 12S rRNA). Cantellius hoegi differs from C. pallidas and C. sextus by >5% in all three mitochondrial genes (COI, 16S, and 12S rRNA) sequenced. The values of sequence divergence in 12S are comparable to the inter-specific divergence reported for other Cantellius and Savignium species. Interestingly, C. hoegi is not the sister group of C. pallidas, a morphologically similar species, in the present study. Further studies should focus on molecular phylogenetic analysis of Cantellius species. Copyright © 2009 · Magnolia Press.

64349100171	Cypris morphology in the barnacles Ibla and Paralepas (crustacea: Cirripedia thoracica) implications for cirripede evolution	We used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to describe cypris morphology in species of the barnacles Ibla and Paralepas, both of which are pivotal in understanding cirripede evolution. In Ibla, we also studied late naupliar stages with video and SEM. Special emphasis was put on the lattice organs, the antennules and the thorax and telson. In Paralepas we had settled specimens only and could therefore only investigate the carapace with the lattice organs. Cyprids of Ibla quadrivalvis and Paralepas dannevigi have five sets of lattice organs, grouped as two anterior and three posterior pairs. The organs are of the pore-field type and the terminal pore is situated anteriorly in the first pair, just as in the Rhizocephala and the Thoracica. In Ibla the armament of antennular sensilla resembles that found in the Thoracica but differs from the Rhizocephala. The absence of setules on the A and B setae sited terminally on the fourth antennular segment is a similarity with the Acrothoracica. The attachment disc is angled rather than facing distally and is encircled by a low cuticular velum. The thoracopods have two-segmented endopods and exopods as in the Thoracica, but the number, shape, and position of thoracopodal setae differ somewhat from other species of that superorder. Both Ibla and Paralepas cyprids have a deeply cleaved telson, but no independent abdominal part. In cypris morphology, Ibla and Paralepas show several synapomorphies with the clade comprising Rhizocephala and Thoracica and there are no specific apomorphies with either the Acrothoracica, the Rhizocephala or any particular subgroup within the Thoracica. This is in agreement with recent molecular evidence that Ibla (Ibliformes) is the sister taxon to all other Thoracica and the ibliforms therefore become the outgroup of choice for studying character evolution within the superorder. Paralepas, and other pedunculated barnacles without shell plates, are apparently not primitive but are secondarily evolved and nested within the Thoracica. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

67649182835	Comparison between the catch composition of the French and ORE type beam trawls on deep-sea decapod crustaceans: Implications for quantitative sampling of the deep-sea decapod biodiversity	The French beam trawl and the ORE beam trawl are common research sampling gears for deep-sea biodiversity. The French beam trawl is equipped with a tickler chain and a pair of iron sides. The ORE beam trawl has a larger mouth area than the French beam trawl and has no tickler chain. With a tickler chain, the French beam trawl appears to yield more benthic catches, whilst the ORE beam trawl may be able to collect more bathypelagic species, due to its larger mouth area. In the present study, the assemblages of decapod crustaceans in Taiwan deep waters collected with the French type and the ORE type beam trawls were compared at depths of 250, 500, and 1200 meters. With multivariate analysis, the species abundance of the catches collected by both methods appeared similar, but the catches in the French beam trawl had higher taxonomic distinctness and yielded more benthic species (especially Brachyura) at depths of 250 m and 500 m when compared to the ORE beam trawl. There were no differences in abundance of pelagic species between the two trawls, suggesting that the degree of net avoidance by species in both trawls was similar. The sizes of the dominant catches were similar in both trawls, indicating that the mesh escapement was similar in both the French beam trawl and the ORE beam trawl. During operations, the French beam trawl appears to be more robust to work on rougher terrains (e.g., with lots of sunken wood and mud). In the present study, we revealed that both French beam trawl and ORE beam trawl generally show a similar performance in collecting deep-sea decapod crustaceans, except that the French beam trawl may yield a greater diversity of benthic species at the 250 and 500 m levels. Further research is needed to compare the performance of the two trawls for catching other groups of deep-sea benthic animals (e.g., molluscs and fishes), which is essential for gear consideration in quantitative community studies. © 2009 Brill Academic Publishers.

68149159819	Larval development and sex ratio variation of polyascus plana (Cirripedia: Rhizocephala), a parasite of the crab grapsusalbolineatus, in Taiwan	Members of the Rhizocephala are parasitic barnacles in the Crustacea. The life cycle of the Rhizocephala is composed of planktonic larval stages and an endoparasitic adult stage. Most studies have used temperate species as models, and little is known about rhizocephalan ecology in subtropical and tropical waters. Because reproduction and larval development of the Rhizocephala can vary with the environment, tropical Rhizocephala may have different life history patterns than their temperate counterparts. We investigated the larval morphology of the tropical Polyascus plana Boschma, 1933 (parasitic on the crab, Grapsus albolineatus Lamarck, 1818 which inhabits exposed rocky shores) using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Crabs with Polyascus externae were collected and maintained at 22-25 °C aerated seawater. Released nauplii were transferred into beakers containing 500 ml of aerated, filtered, and autoclaved seawater and the culture was maintained at 15, 20, and 25°C. Larval development was completed in 66 hrs from hatching at 20°C, similar to the subtropical sacculinids, Loxothylascus panopaei Gissler, 1884 and Loxothylacus texanus Boschma, 1933. The short larval development time of P. plana could be an adaptation to enhance successful settlement along exposed rocky shores. Naupliar morphology differed between the sexes. The hind body of female nauplii (stages I-IV) is more slender than that of males. The first seta and head shield of males have pores, but they are lacking in females. Male cyprids can be distinguished from females by a large posterior aesthetasc on segment III. Larval sex ratio was variable and there may be a seasonal component, with a higher percentage of females in summer and of males in winter. This seasonal variation in the larval sex ratio suggests that summer is the recruitment season for new parasites, and winter is the period for implantation of males into virgin externae.

Larval development includes six naupliar stages and a non-feeding cypris stage. Larvae reached the cypris stage in 20d at ∼21°C compared to 14d at ∼28°C. Morphological features including the cephalic shield, frontal horns, labrum, abdominal process, antennules, antennac and mandibles in all nauplius and cypris stages were described and illustrated using a combination of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Attempts were made to compare morphological differences between the nauplii and cyprid of C. malayensis with those of other Chthamalus species including C. stellatus, C. montagui, C. dentatus, C. fragilis, C. dalli, C. antennatus, C. fissus and C. challengeri. The present description of the nauplii of C. malayensis is not in agreement with the previous description of this species.

72549117023	Variations in intertidal assemblages and zonation patterns between vertical artificial seawalls and natural rocky shores: A case study from Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong	Nelson W.Y. Lam, Richard Huang, and Benny K.K. Chan (2009) Variations in intertidal assemblages and zonation patterns between vertical artificial seawalls and natural rocky shores: a case study from Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong. Zoological Studies 48(2): 184-195. Development of coastal cities often results in destruction of natural coastlines, which are consequently replaced by artificial coastal urban structures, commonly including smoothly surfaced vertical seawalls. Artificial seawalls can create novel habitats which may affect the diversity, abundances, and distribution patterns of intertidal assemblages. In the present study, the intertidal assemblages on 3 vertical artificial seawalls and 3 natural rocky shores were studied in Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong. Both artificial seawalls and natural rocky shores shared similar assemblages of common species, but the species abundance and percentage cover of certain taxa differed between the 2 habitat types. Artificial seawalls supported a greater abundance of the chiton Acanthopleura japonica and greater percentage coverage of the oyster Saccostrea cucullata and barnacle Amphibalanus (=Balanus) amphitrite. In contrast, a greater abundance of the false limpet Siphonaria laciniosa and a greater percentage cover of the barnacle Tetraclita squamosa occurred on natural rocky shores. Some species were found exclusively on only one of the habitats. The green mussel Perna viridus, tube worms Hydriodes spp., and sea squirt Styela sp. were only found on artificial seawalls, while the black mussel Septifer virgatus was exclusively recorded on natural rocky shores. Artificial seawalls had different zonation patterns compared to natural rocky shores. The barnacle Tetraclita squamosa and chiton Acanthopleura japonica were commonly low on natural rocky shores but they became abundant on the mid-shore of artificial seawalls. Differences in zonation patterns of species could be due to the vertical orientation of artificial seawalls leading to different temperature and humidity profiles compared to natural rocky shores. Spatial variability of the assemblage structure at the scale of tens of meters was greater on natural rocky shores than on artificial seawalls. Greater horizontal spatial variation in species assemblages on natural rocky shores may be associated with greater habitat diversity (e.g., rock pools, crevices, and vertical and horizontal surfaces) on natural shores than on smooth vertical seawalls. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/48.2/184.pdf.

74249091925	Spatial and temporal variation in diets of the crabs Metopograpsus frontalis (Grapsidae) and Perisesarma bidens (Sesarmidae): Implications for mangrove food webs	The diets of the mangrove crabs, Metopograpsus frontalis Miers and Perisesarma bidens de Haan, were investigated monthly for 13 months at two Hong Kong mangroves, to examine possible spatial and temporal influences on their feeding ecology. In both species, a higher degree of gut fullness was observed in summer (May-September) than in winter, suggesting a reduction in winter foraging activity. M. frontalis was omnivorous, with animal and plant materials and inorganic sediments being the major food items. P. bidens was detritivorous, with plant materials and inorganic sediment dominating the gut contents. M. frontalis is, therefore, an opportunistic feeder, whilst P. bidens, like many other members of the Sesarmidae, is a detritivore. Some degree of seasonal variation was shown in the diet of M. frontalis (with more algal material in winter) and P. bidens (with more sediments in summer), but diets were similar between sexes in both species. The dietary pattern of M. frontalis also varied between sites. The diets of the crabs, therefore, appear to be a result of the interplay between the seasonal, physical climate and biological factors, especially food availability and the crabs' ecology. Results suggest that the predatory role of Metopograpsus, which has been poorly studied, is potentially important to estuarine food webs; whilst the trophic importance of sesarmid crabs, such as Perisesarma, especially in mangrove outwelling, should be critically re-evaluated. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

Previously, the biodiversity of Taiwanese deep-sea barnacles had not been studied extensively, due to a lack of deep-sea expeditions and sampling. Recently, several TAIWAN deep-sea cruises investigated the biodiversity of the deep-sea fauna of Taiwan and sampling was conducted to depths of 4000 m. The present study reports on the biodiversity of the deep-sea barnacles of Taiwan, a total of 18 species. One species was previously recorded from Taiwanese waters and 17 are new records, including two new species belong to the genera Litoscalpellum and Altiverruca. Copyright © 2010 Magnolia Press.

Scopimera globosa De Haan, 1835, the type species, was described from Japanese specimens and also occurs in Korea and China. Scopimera tuberculata Stimpson, 1858, described from Japan, has been regarded a junior synonym of S. globosa, but the types had long been lost. Some workers have considered the two taxa distinct and S. tuberculata has been recorded from South China. In the present study, we confirm using male gonopod morphology and molecular analysis, that the early records of S. tuberculata from Hong Kong and S. globosa from Taiwan are in fact S. intermedia Balss, 1934. The present study regards S. tuberculata as a subjective junior synonym to S. globosa. A new species, Scopimera ryukyuensis sp. nov. from the Ryukyus, is identified and described herein. The new species is close to S. globosa but can be separated by carapace characters. The mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene revealed basepair (bp) difference between the new species and other Scopimera spp. to be at the interspecific level, at least 28 bp (4.3%).

Dayawanensis Chen, 1986, and P. pseudohastatoides Yang and Tang, 2006 (Crustacea: Decapoda: Portunidae): Essentials for benthic ecological monitoring and biodiversity studies	The portunid crab Portunus hastatoides Fabricius, 1798, is a widely distributed common deposit feeder in sandy and muddy subtidal ecosystems in Indo-Pacific waters and has been frequently used as an indicator species in ecological monitoring studies. The identifcation of P. hastatoides in many previous monitoring studies was somewhat ambiguous and likely confused by the coexistence of other morphologically similar species (i.e., P. dayawanensis Chen, 1986, and P. pseudohastatoides Yang and Tang, 2006), which were often misidentifed as P. hastatoides. Correct species identification is crucial to generate accurate results from ecological monitoring and biodiversity surveys. In this paper, we redescribe the diagnostic features of these 3 morphologically similar species, P. hastatoides (but see below), P. dayawanensis, and P. pseudohastatoides in Hong Kong and Taiwanese waters and provide a refned species identifcation guide for benthic ecologists and environmental protection authorities. In the present study, we also found that P. hastatoides in Hong Kong and Taiwan morphologically differed from one of the types of P. hastatoides (from the Indian Ocean), suggesting the presence of a cryptic species complex. Before any extensive revisions are made on the group, we continue to refer to the Hong Kong and Taiwanese populations as P. hastatoides. Crab specimens were trawled from marine environments within the Taiwan Strait where these 3 Portunus species are common. Key features of each of these species were identified; these included the morphology of the carapace frontal teeth and male 1st pleopod.

77957857185	Diversity and distribution of fiddler crabs (Brachyura: Ocypodidae: Uca) from China, with new records from Hainan island in the South China sea	The fiddler crab fauna (Brachyura: Ocypodidae: Uca) of China is reviewed. Thirteen species are recognised here, viz. Uca acuta (Stimpson, 1858), U. annulipes (H. Milne Edwards, 1837), U. arcuata (De Haan, 1835), U. borealis Crane, 1975, U. coarctata (H. Milne Edwards, 1852), U. crassipes (Adams & White, 1848), U. dussumieri (H. Milne Edwards, 1852), U. lactea (De Haan, 1835), U. paradussumieri Bott, 1973, U. tetragonon (Herbst, 1790), U. triangularis (A. Milne-Edwards, 1873), U. typhoni Crane, 1975, and U. vocans (Linnaeus, 1758). Two females of U. typhoni collected from southern Hainan Island represent the first record of this species from China and East Asia. Two males of U. tetragonon collected from southern Hainan also represent a new record for China. The Uca fauna of southern Hainan is biogeographically distinct being different from those of northern Hainan and continental China, with U. annulipes, U. tetragonon, U. typhoni, and U. vocans common in Southeast Asia. In addition, continental China also lacks some insular species such as U. coarctata, U. formosensis Rathbun, 1921, U. jocelynae Shih, Naruse & Ng, 2010, U. perplexa (H. Milne Edwards, 1837), and U. tetragonon which are common in the East Asian islands of Taiwan and the Ryukyus. Copyright © 2010 · Magnolia Press.

78449273473	Effects of habitat modification on coastal fish assemblages	The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of anthropogenic modification of coastal habitats on fish assemblages in Taiwan, comparing the abundance, species richness and taxonomic composition of fishes on natural v. artificial habitats. While there was no significant variation in the abundance or richness of fishes between natural and artificial habitats, the species composition of fishes in artificial habitats was significantly different from that of natural habitats. Natural reefs were characterized by greater abundance of Stethojulis spp. (Labridae), Abudefduf spp. (Pomacentridae) and Thalassoma spp. (Labridae), whereas anthropogenic habitats were dominated by Parupeneus indicus (Mullidae), Pempheris oualensis (Pempheridae) and Parapriacanthus ransonneti (Pempheridae). In general, it appears that specialist reef-associated species are being replaced with fishes that are much more generalist in their habitat-use. The loss of natural coastal habitats may threaten some species that cannot live in anthropogenically altered habitats, though the overall abundance and diversity of coastal fishes was not significantly different between natural and artificial habitats in Taiwan. © 2010 The Authors.

79952759503	Feeding modes of deep-sea lobsters (Crustacea: Decapoda: Nephropidae and Palinuridae) in Northwest Pacific waters: Functional morphology of mouthparts, feeding behaviour and gut content analysis	The setation of the mouthparts, gut contents and video recordings of live individuals of the deep-sea clawed lobsters (Nephropidae) Metanephrops formosanus, M. armatus and the spiny lobster (Palinuridae) Puerulus angulatus from northwest Pacific waters were analysed to get an insight into their feeding modes. A comparison of SEM photos shows a high degree of similarity between the morphology and setation of the mouthparts of M. formosanus and M. armatus, but that of P. angulatus was very different to Metanephrops. Serrate setae are most abundant on the feeding appendages of M. formosanus and M. armatus. The mouthparts of P. angulatus are dominated by simple and cuspidate setae. Gut contents of Metanephrops spp. contained small crustacean parts, fish and bivalves and a considerable amount of sediment (∼60% relative abundance). Guts of Puerulus contained mostly small pieces of fish and crustaceans and only a relatively minor amount of sediment (<10%). Video analysis revealed that the studied Metanephrops species are able to handle soft food items by cutting and abrading movements of the mouthparts. Puerulus would not feed on presented food items under lab conditions. The feeding appendages and their setation are clearly related to the feeding modes of the species studied. Both Metanephrops species have slender appendages with fine and sharp setae, suggesting it is a predator and/or scavenger on small crustaceans and ingest deposits to a limited extent. Puerulus angulatus has thick and shorter appendages with strong simple and cuspidate setae, possibly corresponding to a more predatory lifestyle. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

79952515728	Cryptic diversity of the semi-terrestrial amphipod Platorchestia japonica (Tattersall, 1922) (Amphipoda: Talitrida: Talitridae) in Japan and Taiwan, with description of a new species	The talitrid amphipod Platorchestia Bousfield, 1982 is common in sandy beaches, estuarine marshes, shores of lakes and rivers. They are detritivores, and being prey for birdsand other animals, they play an important role in the food chain. In the present study, we identified a new Platorchestia from Guan-du, Taiwan, based on morphological (light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy) and molecular approach (sequence divergence in the mitochondria DNA, COI) and described herein. Platorchestia paludosus sp. nov. from theGuan-du was morphologically different from all reported Platorchestia species, but it was very close to P. japonica (Tattersall, 1922). The distribution pattern of setae in the lateral margin of the telson and sharpness of ramus tip of uropod 3, however, exhibit diagnostic differences between the two species. From sequence divergence in COI, Platorchestia paludosus differed from P. japonica 13.3% in average, values that are comparable to inter-specific differences in other amphipod taxa.

0035657562	Studies on Tetraclita squamosa and Tetraclita japonica (Cirripedia: Thoracica). I: Adult morphology	Tetraclita squamosa and Tetraclita japonica have recently been separated into two species using allozyme and DNA analysis. The morphologies of the two species, however, have not been described fully, resulting in confusion over diagnostic characters and identification. Tetraclita squamosa has greenish parietes and the tergo-scutal flaps are black with two pairs of white spots. Tetraclita japonica has purplish-grey parietes and the tergo-scutal flaps are not patterned. These characters are good for in-situ species identification. The third cirrus of T. japonica possess an additional bidentate-type seta, which is absent from T. squamosa. Results of discriminant function analysis indicate the shape of the parietes and the scutum geometry of T. squamosa and T. japonica show intraspecific variation between sites, indicating they are not diagnostic characters for separating the two species. The basi-scutal angle of the tergum, however, is significantly different between the two species and is useful in distinguishing the species. By means of these specific criteria, the two species can be identified with confidence on the shore and in the laboratory.

Scopimera sheni sp. nov. from Qingdao, represents the fourth species of the genus to be recognized from North China. Scopimera philippinensis sp. nov. is the first record of the genus from the Philippines. Morphologically both new species belong to the "normal form" Scopimera (sensu Kemp 1919). Amongst other characters, each can be distinguished by its diagnostic male first gonopod. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene sequences showed two distinct clades. An East Asia group (Chinese coasts, Japan, Korea and Taiwan) consisting of S. globosa De Haan, 1835, S. ryukyuensis Wong, Chan et Shih, 2010, S. sheni sp. nov., S. longidactyla Shen, 1932 and S. curtelsona (= S. cutelsoma) Shen, 1936; and a Southeast Asia group consisting of the closely related S. philippinensis sp. nov. and S. intermedia Balss, 1934.

84856500111	Tetraclita ehsani sp. n. (Cirripedia, Tetraclitidae), a common intertidal barnacle from the Gulf of Oman, Iran	A new species of intertidal acorn barnacle Tetraclita ehsani sp. n. was identifed from the Iranian coast in the Gulf of Oman. T. ehsani sp. n. inhabits low exposed rocky shores and also attaches to shells of molluscs and the barnacle Megabalanus species. Parietes of T. ehsani ranged from white to pink which is diferent from T. serrata (in South African waters), which has green parietes. Morphology of the tergum and cirrus III of T. ehsani sp. n. is distinctive from other described West Indian Ocean species which have pink or white parietes (T. rufotincta, T. achituvi and T. reni). Te tergum of T. ehsani is very narrow and the basal margin is slightly concave or straight, in contrast to T. rufotincta and T. reni, in which the tergum are board and with a very concave basal margin. Cirrus I anterior ramus of both T. ehsani and T. reni is anten-niform and thus difering from the cirrus I of T. rufotincta (see Chan et al. 2009). Cirrus III of T. ehsani sp. n. is non-antenniform and lacks multicuspidate type setae, which is diferent from T. reni by having an antenniform cirrus III and with multicuspidate setae. © Adnan Shahdadi et al.

84860535921	Cryptic diversity of the acrothoracican barnacle Armatoglyptes taiwanus in the Indo-Pacific waters, with description of a new species from the Mozambique Channel collected from the MAINBAZA cruise	Cirripedes of the superorder Acrothoracica are normally found as epizoic borings on marine calcareous substrates. Armatoglyptes taiwanus (Utinomi, 1950) is a lithoglyptid acrothoracican barnacle reported from different parts of the Indo-Pacific. Recent studies have demonstrated phylogenetic breaks between the Indian and Pacific Oceans populations in widespread Indo-Pacific marine organisms due to isolation events during the Pleistocene glaciations. It is possible that A. taiwanus represents a cryptic species complex in the Indo-Pacific, which the previous studies have failed to identify from morphology alone. In the present study, we analyzed the morphology and the sequence divergence of the 12S rDNA of A. taiwanus from the Indo-Pacific region, including Taiwan and the Philippines in the Pacific, and Phuket Island (Thailand) and the Mozambique Channel in the Indian Ocean, to test whether A. taiwanus is a cryptic species across its geographical range. The results showed that A. taiwanus has a homogeneous population structure in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Phuket Island (sequence divergence < 1%). Specimens from the Mozambique Channel, although morphologically similar to A. taiwanus, have a greater sequence divergence of 9.4% from A. taiwanus in the Pacific, and thus appeared to represent a new species, described herein as Armatoglyptes flexuosus n. sp. Although both speciesare morphologically similar, A. flexuosus n. sp. has more strongly bent/recurved posterior processes of the opercular bars and feebler armament of the orificial knob than does A. taiwanus from Taiwan (type locality). Phylogenetic analysis showed that populations of A. flexuosus n. sp. from the Mozambique Channel and A. taiwanus from the Pacific region are indeed closely related. Populations of their common ancestor may have become isolated and underwent speciation during the Pleistocene glaciations. © Publications Scientifiques du Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris.

0037471575	The impact of physical stress and molluscan grazing on the settlement and recruitment of Tetraclita species (Cirripedia: Balanomorpha) on a tropical shore	Tetraclita japonica [Bull. U. S. Natl. Mus. 93 (1916) 241] and Tetraclita squamosa [Encycl. Method.: Hist. Natl. Vers 1 (1789) 158] are common barnacles on exposed, oceanic Hong Kong coasts, occupying the mid and lower shore, respectively. The percentage cover of the two species is moderate (< 60%) and the remaining rock space is bare or occupied by sparse patches of encrusting algae and grazing molluscs. Settlement of the two Tetraclita species occurs during the physically stressful summer over a wide vertical range, exceeding their adult upper limit. A manipulative experiment including roofs (to reduce heat stress) and fences (to exclude grazers) at two tidal levels (one in the adult T. japonica zone and the other above this zone) showed that recruits, which settled above the adult upper limit (except those under roofs), were killed by heat stress. Recruitment of the two species was also higher where grazers were excluded and where the rock surface was shaded as compared to unmanipulated areas in the adult T. japonica zone. Heat stress appears the dominant factor limiting recruit density above the barnacles' upper limit, whilst removal by grazers, combined with heat stress, controlled density within the adult zone. The vertical distribution of each species is therefore limited by post-settlement and post-recruitment mortality induced primarily by physical stress, whereas abundance within their normal heights is mediated by an interaction between heat stress and the impact of molluscan grazers. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

84866322011	Phylogeography of the cold-water barnacle Chthamalus challengeri in the north-western Pacific: Effect of past population expansion and contemporary gene flow	Aim Phylogeographical patterns of marine organisms in the north-western Pacific are shaped by the interaction of past sea-level fluctuations during glacial maxima and present-day gene flow. This study examines whether observed population differentiation in the barnacle Chthamalus challengeri, which is endemic to the north-western Pacific, can be explained by the interactions between historical glacial events and patterns of contemporary gene flow. Location Eleven locations in the north-western Pacific. Methods Partial sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), 12S, 16S and nuclear internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) were obtained from 312 individuals. Parsimony haplotype networks and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) were used to determine whether the observed genetic structure corresponds to marine provinces (Kuroshio Current and China Sea Coastal Provinces), zoogeographical zones (oriental and Japan warm-temperate zones) and/or potential refugial areas (Sea of Japan and East China Sea) in the north-western Pacific. Neutrality tests, mismatch distribution analysis and Bayesian skyline plots were used to infer the demographic history of C.challengeri. Results In total, 312, 117, 182 and 250 sequences were obtained for COI, 12S, 16S and ITS1, respectively. A panmictic population was revealed, which did not conform to the 'isolation by distance' model. None of the a priori population groupings based on marine provinces, zoogeographical zones or potential refugial areas was associated with observed genetic patterns. Significant negative values from neutrality tests and the unimodal mismatch distribution and expansion patterns in Bayesian skyline plots for the COI and 16S data sets indicate a population expansion in the mid-Pleistocene (c.200ka). Information from the fossil record suggests that there has been a northward range shift of this species from the East China Sea or the Palaeo-Pacific coast of Japan to the Sea of Japan since the mid-Pleistocene. Mainconclusions Chthamalus challengeri has experienced a population expansion and range shift since the mid-Pleistocene. The observed lack of population differentiation can be explained by this past population expansion and present-day wide-scale larval dispersal (owing to the long planktonic larval duration) across marine provinces, which have led to the successful establishment of the species in different zoogeographical zones and habitats. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84866372425	Description of a new species of coral-inhabiting barnacle, Darwiniella angularis sp. n. (Cirripedia, Pyrgomatidae) from Taiwan	The present study has identified a new species from the previously monotypic genus Darwiniella Anderson, 1992. Darwiniella angularis sp. n. is similar to D. conjugatum (Darwin, 1854) in external shell morphology and arthropodal characters. Darwiniella conjugatum, however, has a sharper tergal spur and a less obvious adductor plate angle when compared to D. angularis sp. n. Molecular analyses on mitochondrial DNA 12S rDNA and COI regions also support the morphological differences. Sequence divergences in 12S rDNA and COI between D. conjugatum and D. angularis sp. n. are 5% and 13% respectively, which are equivalent to the inter-specific sequence divergences in other barnacles. Both Darwiniella species are common on Cyphastrea Milne-Edwards and Haime, 1848 corals and D. angularis sp. n. is also collected from Astreopora de Blainville, 1830 corals in Taiwan. © Yi-Yang Chen et al.

84866411760	Zoogeography of Intertidal Communities in the West Indian Ocean as Determined by Ocean Circulation Systems: Patterns from the Tetraclita Barnacles	The Indian Ocean is the least known ocean in the world with the biogeography of marine species in the West Indian Ocean (WIO) understudied. The hydrography of WIO is characterized by four distinct oceanographic systems and there were few glacial refugia formations in the WIO during the Pleistocene. We used the widely distributed intertidal barnacle Tetraclita to test the hypothesis that the distribution and connectivity of intertidal animals in the WIO are determined by the major oceanographic regime but less influenced by historical events such as Pleistocene glaciations. Tetraclita were studied from 32 locations in the WIO. The diversity and distribution of Tetraclita species in the Indian Ocean were examined based on morphological examination and sequence divergence of two mitochondrial genes (12S rDNA and COI) and one nuclear gene (histone 3, H3). Divergence in DNA sequences revealed the presence of seven evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) of Tetraclita in WIO, with most of them recognized as valid species. The distribution of these ESUs is closely tied to the major oceanographic circulation systems. T. rufotincta is distributed in the Monsoonal Gyre. T. ehsani is present in the Gulf of Oman and NW India. Tetraclita sp. nov. is associated with the Hydrochemical Front at 10°S latitude. T. reni is confined to southern Madagascan and Mauritian waters, influenced by the West Wind Drift. The endemic T. achituvi is restricted to the Red Sea. Tetraclita serrata consists of two ESUs (based on mtDNA analysis) along the east to west coast of South Africa. The two ESUs could not be distinguished from morphological analysis and nuclear H3 sequences. Our results support that intertidal species in the West Indian Ocean are associated with each of the major oceanographic circulation systems which determine gene flow. Geographical distribution is, however, less influenced by the geological history of the region. © 2012 Tsang et al.

84867516432	Metamorphosis in balanomorphan, pedunculated, and parasitic barnacles: A video-based analysis	Cypris metamorphosis was followed using video microscopy in four species of cirripeds representing the suspension-feeding pedunculated and sessile Thoracica and the parasitic Rhizocephala. Cirripede metamorphosis involves one or more highly complex molts that mark the change from a free cypris larva to an attached suspension feeder (Thoracica) or an endoparasite (Rhizocephala). The cyprids and juveniles are so different in morphology that they are functionally incompatible. The drastic reorganization of the body implicated in the process can therefore only commence after the cyprid has irreversibly cemented itself to a substratum. In both Megabalanus rosa and Lepas, the settled cyprid first passes through a quiescent period of tissue reorganization, in which the body is raised into a position vertical to the substratum. In Lepas, this is followed by extension of the peduncle. In both Lepas and M. rosa, the juvenile must free itself from the cypris cuticle by an active process before it can extend the cirri for suspension feeding. In M. rosa, the juvenile performs intensely pulsating movements that result in shedding of the cypris carapace ̃8 h after settlement. Lepas sp. sheds the cypris cuticle ̃2 days after settlement due to contractile movements of the peduncle. In Lepas anserifera, the juvenile actively breaks through the cypris carapace, which can thereafter remain for several days without impeding cirral feeding. Formation of the shell plates begins after 1-2 days under the cyprid carapace in Lepas. In M. rosa, the free juvenile retains its very thin cuticle and flexible shape for some time, and shell plates do not appear until sometime after shedding of the cypris cuticles. In Sacculina carcini, the cypris settles at the base of a seta on the host crab and remains quiescent and aligned at an angle of ̃60° to the crab's cuticle. The metamorphosis involves two molts, resulting in the formation of an elongated kentrogon stage with a hollow injection stylet. Due to the orientation of the cyprid, the stylet points directly towards the base of the crab's seta. Approximately 60 h after settlement the stylet penetrates down one of the cyprid antennules and into the crab. Almost immediately afterwards the unsegmented vermigon stage, preformed in the kentrogon, passes down through the hollow stylet and into the crab's hemocoel in a process lasting only 30 s. In S. carcini, the carapace can remain around the metamorphosing individual without impeding the process. © The Author 2012.

84867566956	Genetic and morphological differentiation of the indo-west pacific intertidal barnacle chthamalus malayensis	Synopsis Chthamalus malayensis is a common intertidal acorn barnacle widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific. Analysis of sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I reveals four genetically differentiated clades with almost allopatric distribution in this region. The four clades exhibit morphological differences in arthropodal characters, including the number of conical spines and number of setules of the basal guard setae on the cirri. These characters are, however, highly variable within each clade; such that the absolute range of the number of conical spines and setules overlaps between clades, and therefore, these are not diagnostic characters for taxonomic identification. The geographic distribution of the four clades displays a strong relationship between surface temperatures of the sea and ocean-current realms. The Indo-Malay (IM) clade is widespread in the tropical, equatorial region, including the Indian Ocean, Malay Peninsula, and North Borneo. The South China (SC) and Taiwan (TW) clades are found in tropical to subtropical regions, with the former distributed along the coasts of southern China, Vietnam, Thailand, and the western Philippines under the influence of the South China Warm Current. The TW clade is endemic to Taiwan, while the Christmas Island (CI) clade is confined to CI. There was weak or no population subdivision observed within these clades, suggesting high gene flow within the range of the clades. The clades demonstrate clear signatures of recent demographic expansion that predated the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), but they have maintained a relatively stable effective population in the past 100,000 years. The persistence of intertidal fauna through the LGM may, therefore, be a common biogeographic pattern. The lack of genetic subdivision in the IM clade across the Indian and Pacific Oceans may be attributed to recent expansion of ranges and the fact that a mutation-drift equilibrium has not been reached, or the relaxed habitat requirements of C. malayensis that facilitates high concurrent gene flow. Further studies are needed to determine between these alternative hypotheses. © The Author 2012.

84869173111	The ghost crab Ocypode mortoni George, 1982 (Crustacea: Decapoda: Ocypodidae): Redescription, distribution at its type locality, and the phylogeny of East Asian Ocypode species	The ghost crab Ocypode mortoni George, 1982 was first described from the sandy shores of Sai Wan, Hong Kong, and although also identified from South China and Japan, has not been subsequently recorded in Hong Kong. The taxonomic status of O. mortoni is not clear as its original morphological description was not detailed, and there remains no information on its vertical and horizontal ecological distribution in Hong Kong. In the present study, O. mortoni was found to be locally rare in Hong Kong, only present at three of seven surveyed sites. It was always sympatric with the common O. ceratophthalmus (Pallas, 1772) at the same tidal level, and there appeared to be no clear habitat/niche distinction. Relative abundance of O. mortoni vs. O. ceratophthalmus was at most 31%: 69% based on quantitative transect survey data from Sai Wan. Molecular phylogenetic analyses on 24 haplotypes (from 28 individuals) of 636-basepair (bp) mitochondrial cy-tochrome oxidase I (COI) gene of Ocypode spp. in East Asia show O. mortoni is a valid species most closely related to O. stimpsoni Ortmann, 1897, with an average difference of 37.64 bp, and nucleotide divergence of 6.25%. The two species are very similar morphologically, but adults of O. mortoni develop ocular stylets. Copyright © 2012 Magnolia Press.

84869232186	Influence of water temperature on the larval development of Neoverruca sp. and Ashinkailepas seepiophila-Implications for larval dispersal and settlement in the vent and seep environments	Deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps are scattered and limited habitats, and species that are confined to these benthic habitats often have a planktonic larval stage in their life history to maintain dispersal and gene flow among discrete populations. We have reared the larvae of Ashinkailepas seepiophila, inhabiting inactive vents and active cold seeps, through their entire larval development under atmospheric pressure. Using two temperatures (4 °C, 10 °C) we examined whether larval development resembles other vent species in being affected by thermal stimulation. Under laboratory conditions, A. seepiophila completed larval development in 65 days at 4 °C. This is considerably shorter than the 100 days previously reported to be required at the same temperature by Neoverruca sp., a species confined to inhabiting active vents. Also in contrast to Neoverruca sp., A. seepiophila did not drastically shorten the developmental period from nauplius VI to cyprid when exposed to temperature of 10 °C. We conclude that there is no need for late naupliar stages of A. seepiophila to develop into cyprids more quickly at elevated temperatures because this species does not inhabit active vents. The difference in response to water temperature during larval development may contribute to the separated distribution of the two species at active vents (Neoverruca sp.) and inactive vents and cold seep (A. seepiophila) environments. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84873708583	A new passive plankton trap to quantify the supply of crustacean and molluscan larvae to rocky shores	Effective in situ plankton traps, which can accurately quantify spatial and temporal variations in larval supply, are a prerequisite for studies of the dynamic interactions between larval delivery, adult population densities and successful larval recruitment of rocky intertidal organisms. Previously designed plankton traps only functioned when either washed by the incoming or receding tide (swash traps), or when submerged (tube traps), and are therefore probably biased in their estimate of larval supply. Here, we assess a new integrative trap design which captures zooplankton and meroplanktonic larval stages under all appropriate tidal conditions, including wave swash and submersion. Deployment on shores in Taiwan showed that the trap captures a diverse array of meroplankton, including gastropod veliger larvae, bivalve larvae, barnacle nauplii and cyprids, and various stages of crab and shrimp larvae. Comparisons of the integrative design with previous swash and tube traps revealed that the latter yielded disproportionately poor larval catches. Catch composition of the integrative trap was, however, similar to contemporaneous samples obtained with a hand-towed plankton net trawl, indicating little selective bias, whereas the swash trap showed some sampling bias, with slightly greater proportions of copepods compared to the plankton net trawl samples. While previous reports have shown tube traps to be effective in quantifying high densities of barnacle larvae in temperate regions with high tidal amplitude and wave action, the integrative design appears optimal for similar studies of intertidal molluscs and crustaceans in environments characterized by low amplitude tides and reduced larval densities. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84873308995	Morphometric and molecular identification of individual barnacle cyprids from wild plankton: An approach to detecting fouling and invasive barnacle species	The present study used DNA barcodes to identify individual cyprids to species. This enables accurate quantification of larvae of potential fouling species in the plankton. In addition, it explains the settlement patterns of barnacles and serves as an early warning system of unwanted immigrant species. Sequences from a total of 540 individual cypris larvae from Taiwanese waters formed 36 monophyletic clades (species) in a phylogenetic tree. Of these clades, 26 were identified to species, but 10 unknown monophyletic clades represented non-native species. Cyprids of the invasive barnacle, Megabalanus cocopoma, were identified. Multivariate analysis of antennular morphometric characters revealed three significant clusters in a nMDS plot, viz. a bell-shaped attachment organ (most species), a shoe-shaped attachment organ (some species), and a spear-shaped attachment organ (coral barnacles only). These differences in attachment organ structure indicate that antennular structures interact directly with the diverse substrata involved in cirripede settlement. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84873042752	Phylogenetic position and evolutionary history of the turtle and whale barnacles (Cirripedia: Balanomorpha: Coronuloidea)	Barnacles of the superfamily Coronuloidea are obligate epibionts of various marine mammals, marine reptiles and large crustaceans. We used five molecular markers: 12S rDNA, 16S rDNA, 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA and Histone 3 to infer phylogenetic relationships among sixteen coronuloids, representing most of the recent genera of barnacles of this superfamily. Our analyses confirm the monophyly of Coronuloidea and that this superfamily and Tetraclitoidea are sister groups. The six-plated Austrobalanus clusters with these two superfamilies. Based on BEAST and ML trees, Austrobalanus is basal and sister to the Coronuloidea, but the NJ tree places Austrobalanus within the Tetraclitoidae, and in the MP tree it is sister to both Coronuloidea and Tetraclitoidae. Hence the position of Austrobalanus remains unresolved. Within the Coronuloidea we identified four clades. Chelonibia occupies a basal position within the Coronuloidea which is in agreement with previous studies. The grouping of the other clades does not conform to previous studies. Divergence time analyses show that some of the time estimates are congruent with the fossil record while some others are older, suggesting the possibility of gaps in the fossil record. © 2013 Elsevier Inc..

84874574468	Host-Specific Phenotypic Plasticity of the Turtle Barnacle Chelonibia testudinaria: A Widespread Generalist Rather than a Specialist	Turtle barnacles are common epibionts on marine organisms. Chelonibia testudinaria is specific on marine turtles whereas C. patula is a host generalist, but rarely found on turtles. It has been questioned why C. patula, being abundant on a variety of live substrata, is almost absent from turtles. We evaluated the genetic (mitochondrial COI, 16S and 12S rRNA, and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)) and morphological differentiation of C. testudinaia and C. patula from different hosts, to determine the mode of adaptation exhibited by Chelonibia species on different hosts. The two taxa demonstrate clear differences in shell morphology and length of 4-6

84876273550	Diversity and community structure of decapod crustaceans at hydrothermal vents and nearby deep-water fishing grounds off Kueishan Island, Taiwan: A high biodiversity deep-sea area in the NW Pacific	Kueishan Island (northeastern Taiwan) is an important deep-water fishing ground and is world famous for its unique hydrothermal vents that extend from shallow to deep waters. The global scale community structure of deep-sea fauna has received scant attention, thus the present study investigated the biodiversity and community structure of decapod crustaceans in these unique vent and non-vent regions of Kueishan Island. The fauna was sampled with 24 quantitative benthic trawls and with additional monthly surveys of bycatch and commercially important species collected over a year by commercial trawlers. We recorded a total of 51 families, 119 genera, and 202 species of decapod crustaceans. Brachyura was the most diverse group, representing 34% of the species, followed by Caridea (20%), Dendrobranchiata (20%), and Anomura (18%), while Astacidea, Achelata, Polychelida, and Axiidea had lower abundances (8% combined). Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in species composition between the vent and non-vent regions. Some species were recorded at both regions but differed in abundance between the two habitats. The vent crab, Xenograpsus testudinatus Ng, Huang and Ho, 2000, had high abundance on vents but was not recorded in non-vent regions. Comparisons between the community structure of Kueishan Island with Tosa Bay, Sagami Bay, and Suruga Bay, Japan, indicated that Kueishan Island has the highest average taxonomic distinctness and variation in taxonomic distinctness among these deepwater regions. Our results suggest that Kueishan Island is a species-rich, deep-water ecosystem not dominated by a specific taxonomic group. © 2013 Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.

84882321436	Who is moving where? Molecular evidence reveals patterns of range shift in the acorn barnacle Hexechamaesipho pilsbryi in Asia	Global warming is predicted to cause a shift in the geographic ranges of marine organisms. Such shifts have already been observed with the polar retreat of temperate species and northern expansion of more tropical species. Hexechamaesipho pilsbryi is an intertidal acorn barnacle first identified by Hiro in 1936. Hiro reported the southern limit of H. pilsbryi as southern Kyushu Island, Japan. However, H. pilsbryi has recently been recorded in Taiwan as well as Maritime Southeast Asia-suggesting a recent southward range extension into tropical waters that would be contrary to general predictions. To test this hypothesis, we compared the mitochondrial COI gene sequences of 200 individuals sampled from two sites in the previously reported range, and nine sites in the newly reported localities. Two highly diverged lineages were found: a northern lineage, predominantly in Japan and Okinawa, and a southern lineage, primarily in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. The unimodal mismatch distribution and the star-like shaped haplotype network suggest recent demographic expansion in the southern lineage. The molecular data, therefore, rejected the southward extension hypothesis, and instead supported an alternative scenario of a northward range shift of the southern lineage from Southeast Asia to Taiwan. Our results reveal that range shifts in cryptic or poorly studied marine taxa may confound the identification of species' distributions and consequent interpretation of possible changes in ranges and sources of invasion. The application of molecular data to identify and monitor such changes can address these problems and permits a rapid and sensitive confirmation of such events. © Inter-Research 2013.

84882418030	Acrothoracican barnacles (Lithoglyptida) in Taiwan, including the taxonomic status of Balanodytes taiwanus Utinomi, 1950 and cryptic diversity of Auritoglyptes bicornis (Aurivillius, 1892)	We list five acrothoracican barnacles of the order Lithoglyptida currently found in Taiwanese waters, including two new records, Trypetesa habei Utinomi, 1962 and Berndtia purpurea Utinomi, 1950 and a new undescribed species of the genus Lithoglyptes. We also investigate the morphology and molecular genetics of Balanodytes taiwanus Utinomi, from its type locality, Taiwan. The original description of B. taiwanus in Utinomi (1950a) reported the absence of caudal appendages. Re-examination of the somatic body of one of the syntype specimens (the other syntype only having an opercular bar remaining) of B. taiwanus deposited in the Seto Marine Laboratory in Japan, revealed the presence of caudal appendages. The morphology of our specimens collected in various locations in Taiwan fits the description in Utinomi (1950a) and all have caudal appendages. The diagnosis of Balanodytes Utinomi, 1950 is revised herein. The genus Armatoglyptes Kolbasov and Newman, 2005 is a nomen nudum and a junior synonym of Balanodytes. Our results also show that the widespread species Lithoglyptes habei Tomlinson, 1963 is a junior synonym of B. taiwanensis. The molecular sequence divergencse of the 16S RNA and COI genes were studied for samples of another monotypic genus Auritoglyptes (A. bicornis) from different regions of Taiwan. It was shown that there are at least three phylogenetic clades in Taiwan, suggesting that Auritoglyptes represents a cryptic species complex. Copyright © 2013 Magnolia Press.

84885820582	Biodiversity and host specificity of coral barnacles of Galkinia (Cirripedia: Pyrgomatidae) in Taiwan, with descriptions of six new species	Galkinia Ross and Newman, 1995 exclusively contains coral-inhabiting barnacles (Pyrgomatidae) with 4-plated shells and a fused scutum and tergum. In the present study, we applied morphological and molecular analyses (mitochondrial DNA: 12S rDNA and COI regions) to identify six new species, in addition to the two previously described congeneric species. These six species exhibit diagnostic characters in the morphology of the external shells, scutum, and tergum that separate them from all described Galkinia. Host specificity varied among various Galkinia in Taiwan. Galkinia indica (Annandale, 1924) is specific to corals in Hydnophora, while G. adamanteus n. sp. and G. equus n. sp. are specific to Favites abdita, Galkinia depressa n. sp. and G. alliapiculus n. sp., however, are epibiotic on a wider range of coral hosts including Goniastrea, Favites, Montipora, Platygyra, and Merulina. We did not analyze the host specificity of G. décima (Ross and Newman, 1973), G. tabulants n. sp., or G. trimegadonta n. sp. due to limited sample sizes. Based on phylogenetic results, G. alliapiculus n. sp. and G. depressa n. sp. belonged to more-recently evolved phylogenetic clades compared to other species of Galkinia, suggesting a possible evolutionary trend of reduced host specificity by Galkinia. © The Crustacean Society, 2013.

0043269313	Studies on Tetraclita squamosa and Tetraclita japonica (Cirripedia: Thoracica) II: Larval morphology and development	Nauplius larvae (Stages I-VI) and cyprids of Tetraclita squamosa (Brugiére, 1789) and Tetraclita japonica (Pilsbry, 1916) were cultured and their morphologies compared using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Using a mixture of Skeletonema costatum Greville, 1866, Isochrysis galbana Parke, 1938, and Tetraselmis Stein, 1878, sp. as food, the larvae of both species completed naupliar development and metamorphosed to cyprids in ∼14 days at 20°C. The body shape and size of the larvae of both species are similar. The major diagnostic morphological difference is the setation of the antennulae and mandibulae. From Stage V to VI, the antennulae of T. japonica bear one more preaxial seta than T. squamosa. From Stage IV to VI, the mandibulae of T. japonica also bear one more simple seta on the endopodite than T. squamosa. The size, shape, antennular morphology, and surface sculpturing of the cyprids of the two species are similar when observed under SEM. The morphology of T. squamosa and of T. japonica is compared with those of the larvae of other Tetraclita species, and taxonomic relationships within the possibly monophyletic Tetraclitidae are discussed.

84892986118	First study on gene expression of cement proteins and potential adhesion-related genes of a membranous-based barnacle as revealed from Next-Generation Sequencing technology	This is the first study applying Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to survey the kinds, expression location, and pattern of adhesion-related genes in a membranous-based barnacle. A total of 77,528,326 and 59,244,468 raw sequence reads of total RNA were generated from the prosoma and the basis of Tetraclita japonica formosana, respectively. In addition, 55,441 and 67,774 genes were further assembled and analyzed. The combined sequence data from both body parts generates a total of 79,833 genes of which 47.7% were shared. Homologues of barnacle cement proteins - CP-19K, -52K, and -100K - were found and all were dominantly expressed at the basis where the cement gland complex is located. This is the main area where transcripts of cement proteins and other potential adhesion-related genes were detected. The absence of another common barnacle cement protein, CP-20K, in the adult transcriptome suggested a possible life-stage restricted gene function and/or a different mechanism in adhesion between membranous-based and calcareous-based barnacles. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

84893147051	Thirty years of changes in the decapod community from the deep-water fishing grounds off Kueishan Island, Taiwan	The deep water off Kueishan Island, NE Taiwan, is a traditional fishing ground for the deep-water fishing vessels based at Dasi fishing port. Since the opening of the deep-water fishing ports at Dasi in the late 1960s, the fishing grounds off Kueishan Island have been continuously trawled, for over 50 years now. The present study compares the decapod assemblages in the catches of Dasi fishing port among four periods of time, spanning more than 30 years, namely, 1981-1990, 1991-2000, 2001-2010, 2011-2012. A total of 66 families, 203 genera and 420 species of decapod crustaceans have thus been recorded in the catches landed at Dasi fishing port from 1981 to 2012. During 1981-1990, 202 species were recorded, followed by 262 species from 1991-2000, 236 species from 2001-2010, and 265 species from 2011-2012. In all four periods, crabs (Brachyura) were the largest group, representing more than 30%, followed by Dendrobranchiata. Comparing the species composition among the four periods, each period contains a group of species exclusively found at that particular period of time. There were 26 exclusive species in 1981-1990, 49 in 1991-2000, 21 in 2001-2010 and 50 in 2011-2012. On the other hand, there are 94 species common to all four periods. Trajectory plots in the nMDS ordinations shows a gradual directional change in species composition from 1981-1990 to 1991-2000, 2001-2010 and 2011-2012. Since each consecutive period has a higher similarity with the previous than with the other periods, this suggests that the observed trend is not a random pattern. The decapod community in the waters off Kueishan Island has a very high diversity, but the species composition is unstable over time and also changing with time. Under the locally prevailing circumstances, we hypothesize this likely is a succession process in response to the continuous disturbance from the trawl fisheries. © 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

Stimpsoni ortmann, 1897 (Crustacea, Decapoda, Ocypodidae)	Light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to examine the first zoeal stage of four ghost crabs, Ocypode ceratophthalmus (Pallas, 1772), O. cordimanus Latreille, 1818, O. sinensis Dai, Song & Yang, 1985 and O. stimpsoni Ortmann, 1897. Finding diagnostic characters to distinguish between the four species proved difficult because their setal appendage patterns were identical. However the rectangular and pockmarked patterns on the ventral carapace are rather pronounced in O. ceratophthalmus and O. stimpsoni but weak in O. cordimanus and O. sinensis. The spinulation on the furca of the telson is less in O. cordimanus than in the other three species. © 2014 Magnolia Press.

84899090418	Morphological and host specificity evolution in coral symbiont barnacles (Balanomorpha: Pyrgomatidae) inferred from a multi-locus phylogeny	Coral-inhabiting barnacles (Thoracica: Pyrgomatidae) are obligatory symbionts of scleractinian and fire corals. We attempted to reconstruct the phylogeny of coral-inhabiting barnacles using a multi-locus approach (mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA, and nuclear EF1, H3 and RP gene sequences, total 3532. bp), which recovered a paraphyletic pattern. The fire-coral inhabiting barnacle Wanella milleporae occupied a basal position with respect to the other coral inhabiting barnacles. Pyrgomatids along with the coral-inhabiting archaeobalanid Armatobalanus nested within the same clade and this clade was subdivided into two major lineages: Armatobalanus+. Cantellius with species proposed to be the ancestral stock of extant coral barnacles, and the other comprising the remaining genera studied. Ancestral state reconstruction (ASR) suggested multiple independent fusions and separations of shell plates and opercular valves in coral barnacle evolution, which counters the traditional hypothesis founded on a scheme of morphological similarities. Most of the coral barnacles are restricted to one or two coral host families only, suggesting a trend toward narrow host range and more specific adaptation. Furthermore, there is a close linkage between coral host usage and phylogenetic relationships with sister taxa usually being found on the same coral host family. This suggests that symbiotic relationships in coral-inhabiting barnacles are phylogenetically conserved and that host associated specialization plays an important role in their diversification. © 2014 The Authors.

84904417364	A combined morphological and molecular approach in identifying barnacle cyprids from the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve in Malaysia: Essentials for larval ecology studies	Identification of larval mesoplankton is essential to the study of the supply-side ecology of marine benthic or sessile organisms, such as barnacles. Combined morphological and molecular identifications of wild-caught barnacle cyprids from Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR), Malaysia were studied based on mitochondrial 12S-rRNA gene sequences of the unidentified larvae and identified adults. Six species of barnacle adults and cyprids had matched DNA sequences. These included Fistulobalanus pattellaris, Fistulobalanus sp., Amphibalanus reticulatus, Amphibalanus variegatus, Amphibalanus amphitrite, and Euraphia withersi. Morphological characters of the identified cyprids were described, and used to develop a morphology-based classification tree. Carapace sculpturing pattern on the cyprids was the most important morphological discriminator. Preliminary analysis of the diversity of barnacle cyprids in MMFR showed that the dominant species could be morphologically classified with high accuracy. © National University of Singapore.

84907066859	Physiological responses of two acorn barnacles, Tetraclita japonica and Megabalanus volcano, to summer heat stress on a tropical shore	Species living on rocky shores are subject to periodic tidal emersions and can experience intense thermal stress during daytime low tides. Tetraclita japonica and Megabalanus volcano are common intertidal barnacles in Hong Kong, with T. japonica occupying the high to mid-intertidal zone where its lower limits overlap with the upper limits of M. volcano, which is found in the lower intertidal to subtidal zone. In this study, daily profiles of body temperature and hemolymph osmolality on the shore, and responses to thermal challenge under laboratory conditions were compared between the two species to investigate their behavioral and physiological responses to heat and desiccation stress. On-shore measurements of body temperature revealed contrasting thermal profiles, with T. japonica from the upper shore experiencing greater thermal stress than T. japonica and M. volcano from the lower shore. Aerial exposure of the barnacles was associated with an increase in hemolymph osmolality. M. volcano, however, showed a greater increase in hemolymph osmolality than T. japonica at similar shore levels. When the two species were exposed to rock temperatures of 40. °C for 5. h, more individuals (94%) of T. japonica entered a coma state, and at an earlier time than M. volcano (36%). All T. japonica individuals resumed activity when re-immersed in water, whereas in contrast, all M. volcano that went into a coma state did not recover and died within 24. h. Quiescence and reversible coma during the early stages of acute heat stress, as observed in T. japonica, could therefore be adaptive responses to cope with thermal stress in the upper rocky shore.

84907272921	Two new deep-sea stalked barnacles, Arcoscalpellum epeeum sp. nov. and Gymnoscalpellum indopacificum sp. nov., from the Coral Sea, with descriptions of the penis in Gymnoscalpellum dwarf males	The present study describes a new species of Arcoscalpellum Hoek, 1907, and a new species of Gymnoscalpellum Newman & Ross, 1971, collected by deep-sea expeditions led by the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (Paris) in the Coral Sea off New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea (PNG), the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Arcoscalpellum epeeum sp. nov. differs from all described species of Arcoscalpellum by the presence of a long, sharp, sword-shaped carina, which extends beyond the apices of the terga by 1/3 to 1/4 of their length. The species is dioecious, with large females and dwarf males that are sac-like, lack shell plates and are housed in paired receptacles at the inner edges of the scutal plates. Arcoscalpellum epeeum sp. nov. was collected in the waters of New Caledonia and Vanuatu. Gymnoscalpellum indopacificum sp. nov. differs from the six currently described species of Gymnoscalpellum by having a very small inframedian latus and a branched upper latus. The species is dioecious, with large females and dwarf males, the latter composed of 4 shell plates and housed in paired receptacles at the inner edges of the scutal plates. The penis of the dwarf males of G. indopacificum sp. nov. is about 0.8 of the total length of the male and has five side branches extending out along its length. Gymnoscalpellum indopacificum sp. nov. is distributed in the waters of Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, and represents the first record of this genus in the Indo-Pacific region.

84911982673	Worldwide genetic differentiation in the common fouling barnacle, Amphibalanus amphitrite	Amphibalanus amphitrite is a common fouling barnacle distributed globally in tropical and subtropical waters. In the present study, the genetic (mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I) and morphological differentiation in A. amphitrite from 25 localities around the world were investigated. The results revealed three clades within A. amphitrite with a genetic divergence of ~ 4% among clades, whereas there were no diagnostic morphological differences among clades. Clade 1 is widely distributed in both temperate and tropical waters, whereas Clade 3 is currently restricted to the tropical region. The deep divergence among clades suggests historical isolation within A. amphitrite; thus, the present geographical overlaps are possibly a result of the combined effects of rising sea level and human-mediated dispersals. This study highlights the genetic differentiation that exists in a common, widely distributed fouling organism with great dispersal potential; future antifouling research should take into account the choice of lineages.

84919872135	Trophic relationships of hydrothermal vent and non-vent communities in the upper sublittoral and upper bathyal zones off Kueishan Island, Taiwan: a combined morphological, gut content analysis and stable isotope approach	This study used morphological, gut content analysis and carbon- and nitrogen-stable isotope analysis to investigate the trophic structure of upper sublittoral (15–30 m deep) and upper bathyal (200–300 m deep) hydrothermal vents and the adjacent non-vent upper bathyal environment off Kueishan Island. The sublittoral vents host no chemosynthetic fauna, but green and red algae, epibiotic biofilm on crustacean surfaces, and zooplankton form the base of the trophic system. Suspension-feeding sea anemones and the generalist omnivorous vent crab Xenograpsus testudinatus occupy higher trophic levels. The upper bathyal hydrothermal vent is a chemoautotrophic-based system. The vent mussel Bathymodiolus taiwanensis forms a chemosynthetic component of this trophic system. Bacterial biofilm, surface plankton, and algae form the other dietary fractions of the upper bathyal fauna. The vent hermit crab Paragiopagurus ventilatus and the vent crab X. testudinatus are generalist omnivores. The vent-endemic tonguefish Symphurus multimaculatus occupies the top level of the trophic system. The adjacent non-vent upper bathyal region contains decapod crustaceans, which function as either predators or scavengers. The assemblages of X. testudinatus from sublittoral and upper bathyal vents exhibited distinct stable isotope values, suggesting that they feed on different food sources. The upper bathyal Xenograpsus assemblages displayed large variations in their stable isotope values and exhibited an ontogenetic shift in their δ

11244258231	Population dynamics of the acorn barnacles, Tetraclita squamosa and Tetraclita japonica (Cirripedia: Balanomorpha), in Hong Kong	Tetraclita squamosa and Tetraclita japonica are common, intertidal barnacles. In Hong Kong, the population dynamics of the two species exhibited spatial and temporal variation on two semi-exposed shores. T. squamosa produced egg masses from May-June and annual settlement and recruitment occurred from June-July. In contrast, settlement and recruitment of T. japonica was sparse from March-May, but intensified in July-October. Mature gonads and egg masses were, however, only present from September-November, suggesting the larvae from the two settlement pulses originated from other locations as well as Hong Kong populations. Settlement intensity and post-recruitment mortality of the two species varied between sites, possibly due to spatial variation in free rock space, physical transport of larvae and abundance of food in the water column. © Springer-Verlag 2004.
