22344446772	Influence of surfactant on liquid hold-up of gas-liquid two-phase flow in a horizontal pipe	This paper presents investigations on the effect of a surface active agent on the liquid hold-up of gas-liquid two-phase flow in a horizontal pipe using the electrical conductive tomographic technique. Air/water and air/100 mg/kg sodium dodecyl sulphate (with 95% purity grade) aqueous solution are used as working fluids. The results presented a demonstration that the surfactant has no effect on the average liquid hold-up for the air-water stratified smooth flow regime. With increasing the liquid velocity, the stratified wavy flow regime is observed in the air-water flow system. At the moment, the addition of surfactant can suppress or eliminate the interfacial waves and make the liquid hold-up increased. For air-water slug flow, adding surfactant can decrease the liquid hold-up, especially at the lower gas and liquid velocities.

0032217568	Analysis of the test of ER fan clutch	An experiment of the application of ER fluids in the clutch was carried out by reforming a fan clutch used in a truck. At three different input rotating speeds when the strength of applied electric field was changed, the output rotating speeds were recorded and analyzed. By comparing the results got under different experimental procedures with those measured with an electro-rheometer, it can be seen that the shearing rate has tremendous influence on the speed modulating of a fan clutch. It is because the disperse phase can't form chains (clusters) easily at high shear rate. The result tested on the present ER fluid demonstrates that this fluid will show the properties of Newton one, i.e. its apparent viscosity is constant, as the shear rate increases.

0032274080	Application of composite ultrafine particles in ER fluids	A kind of electrorheological (ER) fluid with high comprehensive properties in order to satisfy the needs of engineering applications was obtained. A new type of dispersed phase - composite ultrafine particles (UFP) was obtained by the method of microemulsion, which was used to mix with silicon oil. The electroinduced stress and apparent viscosity of the ER fluids with three different volume fractions were tested under the conditions of different temperatures, electric fields and shear rates. A series of systematic tests show that the new type of ER fluids with volume fraction of 30% possesses obvious ER effect, and the double layers polarization plays an important role in ER effect.

33644650422	Analog-experiment analysis of ash-deposition monitoring model of boiler economizers in power plants	Ash deposition is a form of particulate fouling, and appears usually in boiler economizers. The ash deposition increases capital expenditure, energy input and maintenance costs. An analog experiment for monitoring ash deposition was performed from the analogous objective of a 410 t/h boiler economizer to verify the rationality and reliability of the ash-deposition-monitoring model presented in order to increase the security and economy in economizer running. The analog experiment platform is a tube-shell exchanger that conforms well to the conditions of a self-modeling area. The analog flue gas in the shell side is the heated air mixed with ash, and in the tube side the fluid is water heated by the flue gas. The fluid state in the water side and the flue gas side follows the second self-modeling area. A 4-factor-3 level orthogonal table was used to scheduled operation conditions of orthogonal experiment, with the 4 factors being heat power, flue gas velocity, ashes grain diameter and adding ashes quantity while the three levels are different values due to different position classes in every factor. The ash deposition thermal resistances is calculated by the model with the measure parameters of temperature and pressure drop. It shows that the values of the ash deposition thermal resistances gradually increase up to a stable state. And the experimental results are reliable by F testing method at α=0.001. Therefore, the model can be applied in online monitoring of ash deposition in a boiler economizers in power plants and provides scientific decision on ash deposition prediction and sootblowing.

Concerning the moving direction of inner plates with beveled edge during hump inducing period, the experimental results showed good agreement with theoretical analysis.

33644854103	A theoretical model for calculating pressure drop in the cone area of light dispersion hydrocyclones	Pressure drop in a hydrocyclone reflects the energy necessary for a separation process. It is very important to predict pressure drop in a hydrocyclone design. In this paper, pressure drop in a light dispersion hydrocyclone is conceptually divided into two parts: dissipated pressure drop and effective pressure drop. The latter is the pressure drop in the major separation region that represents the energy converted from static to kinetic form. Based on velocity distributions established by ZHAO and MA, a theoretical model is developed to calculate effective pressure drop in the cone region of light dispersion hydrocyclones. Experimental results prove that the model can give a very good prediction of effective pressure drop. Though the calculated results are more or less higher than the measured, their differences are small enough to be neglected in a hydrocyclone design practice. It is indicated that effective pressure drop can be correlated to flowrate by Δp

The heat resistance of heat sink will decline with the increase of pump power, then with the continuous increasing of pump power the heat resistance change slowly.

The results indicate that the turbulence model of RNG k-ε is more suitable for present experiment condition than other models. The streamline in the micro pin fins is very flexuous. Along the streamline, the pressure of the fluid decreases, while the fluid temperature increases. Vortexes with different sizes, in which pressure keeps constant and temperature fluctuates sharply, are found in the tail part of the pin fins. The heat transfer coefficient of fins reduces following the direction of flow, however, the scope decreases gradually too, and reaches a minimum at some points. The difference of heat transfer coefficient between face and back of the fins reduces as the progress of flow.

The flow and heat transfer parameters are obtained in different volume flowrate and different heat flux, along with simultaneous measurement of the pressure and temperature. It is found that the heat transfer characteristics in trapezoidal silicon microchannels deviated from theoretical predictions for conventional channels. The corner between the side wall and the bottom wall has an significant influence on the flow and heat transfer performances. Based on the test results, a modified relation for the heat transfer characteristics of trapezoidal silicon microchannel heat sink is obtained.

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the combination of unbalanced inertial collisions, multidirectional vortices, and converging/diverging flow caused by the fan-shaped cavities contributes to the improvement of the mixing effectiveness. By using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), numerous studies of the mixing performance and flow features were completed at moderately low Reynolds numbers ranging from 1 to 80. Experimental analysis of the mass transfer and mixing quality along this modified micromixer was performed to validate the numerical results. The computational and experimental results for the concentration distributions and flow patterns reveal the following trends: (i) The combination of transverse Dean vortices effect (vertical plane) and expansion vortices (horizontal plane) effectively contribute to the considerable improvement of the mixing performance. The experimental results were consistent with the numerical results in this respect. (ii) The geometric parameters and the arrangement of the fan-shaped cavity structure are two important factors affecting the mixing performance. When the fan-shaped cavity channel is 3 times as wide as the major subchannel, the mixing index of this type of micromixer was found to reach around 75% at Reynolds numbers larger than 60. Furthermore, we also analyzed the relation between mixing efficiency and pressure drop simultaneously. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

It is shown that the forced convection over micro pin fin heat sinks is a very effective heat transfer mode. The dependence of the Nusselt number on the Reynolds number is considerably notable. The total thermal resistance decreases with the increasing pumping power. Compared with the convection thermal resistance, thermal resistance due to the increase in liquid temperature has more significant effect on the performance of the micro heat sink.

Here we study the effect of surfactant on friction pressure drop in a specifically designed manifold microchannel heat sink. The microchannel has a cross section of 100 microns by 300 microns with a length of 10.0 mm. An anionic surfactant of 100 ppm Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS with 95% purity grade) aqueous solution and a new type of 300 ppm green non-ionic surfactant of Alkyl Polyglycoside (APG1214 with 98% purity grade) aqueous solution are used as the working fluids. It is found that the drag reductions are dependent on the flow velocities and the fluid temperatures. The drag reduction is not significant for laminar flow, but it is increased in the transition flow regime. The temperature rise can promote the drag reductions in the presence of SDS and APG. It is shown that the APG is better than the SDS regarding the drag reductions at high temperatures. © 2008.

The experimental results indicate that: (1) the dimensionless nozzle-to-target spacing (H/d) has notable effects on heat transfer coefficient of both free-surface and submerged jet impingement, and heat transfer may be enhanced with increasing Reynolds number or decreasing dimensionless jet-to-jet spacing (S/d). (2) the enhancement factor (ε) is not influenced by H/d for free surface jet, but it is sensitive to variation of H/d for submerged jet. For both free-surface and submerged jet impingement, ε increases with increasing Re. (3) The convection resistance decreases, at first rapidly and then slowly, with increasing liquid flow rate.

67650234222	Periodical heat transfer in parallel-plate channel of improved flow-inclining inserts	The convective heat transfer and the flow resistance in the 2-D channel with quasi-streamlined insert have been numerically studied in the periodically fully developed regime. The range of the Reynolds number covers both the laminar and the turbulent flow. The effect of the insert angle, the plate thickness vs the Reynolds number on the heat transfer and the friction factor has been identified. The heat transfer gets stronger monotonically with the insert angle from 0° to 30°. Nevertheless, the insert angle impacts the flow resistance in the laminar case much less than in the turbulent case. The combined analysis indicates that the thicker insert is suitable to use in the laminar flow and the thinner insert suitable to the turbulent flow. In any case, the quasi-streamlined insert acts as an upgrader to the local heat transfer coefficient. In comparison with the effect of the original straight flow-inclining insert, the streamlined insert largely diminishes the flow resistance but with only moderate deterioration of the heat transfer. The assessment under the identical pump power consumption reveals the superiority of the improved streamline insert to the straight one. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The result shows that surface tension effect plays a major role when the flow rates of gas and liquid are both low. And the bubbles stagnate between the fins randomly in this stage.

79951769172	Optimum thermal design of microchannel heat sink with triangular reentrant cavities	The effect of geometric parameters on water flow and heat transfer characteristics in microchannel heat sink with triangular reentrant cavities is numerically investigated. A three-dimensional laminar flow model, consisting of Navier-Stokes equations and energy conservation equation, with the conjugate heat transfer between the silicon base and water taken into consideration is solved numerically. In order to find the optimum geometric parameters, four variables, representing the distance and geometry of the triangular reentrant cavity, are designed. It is found that the vortices in the triangular reentrant cavities lead to chaotic advection and can greatly enhance the convective fluid mixing. The thermal and hydraulic boundary layers are interrupted and the repeated developing flow enhances heat transfer in the constant cross-section segment. Furthermore, the effects of the four design variables on heat transfer augmentation and pressure drop penalty are investigated depending on different Reynolds numbers by using the simulated annealing method. Based on the thermal enhancement factor performance maps, the optimal geometric parameters are obtained in principle. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In contrast to the new microchannel heat sink, the corresponding conventional rectangular microchannel heat sink is chosen. The computational fluid dynamics is used to simulate the flow and heat transfer in the heat sinks. The steady, laminar flow and heat transfer equations are solved in a finite-volume method. The SIMPLEX method is used for the computations. The effects of flow rate and heat flux on pressure drop and heat transfer are presented. The results indicate that the microchannel heat sink with offset fan-shaped reentrant cavities in sidewall improved heat transfer performance with an acceptable pressure drop. The fluid flow and heat transfer mechanism of the new microchannel heat sink can attribute to the interaction of the increased heat transfer surface area, the redeveloping of the hydraulic and thermal boundary layers, the jet and throttling effects and the slipping over the reentrant cavities. The increased heat transfer surface area and the periodic thermal developing flow are responsible for the significant heat transfer enhancement. The jet and throttling effects enhance heat transfer, simultaneously increasing pressure drop. The slipping over the reentrant cavities reduces pressure drop, but drastically decreases heat transfer. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It demonstrates that the radial profile of slug flow void fraction is parabolic. Influenced by the falling liquid film, the radial profile curve of liquid slug void fraction in the wake region is also parabolic. Since fully turbulent velocity distribution is built up in the developed region, the void fraction profile in this region is the saddle type. At given superficial liquid velocity, the liquid slug void fraction increases with gas velocity. The radial profiles of liquid slug void fraction at different axial locations are all saddle curves, but void fraction is obviously high around the centerline in the entrance region. The nearer the measuring station is from the entrance, the farther the peak location is away from the wall.

The numerical simulation results indicate that a microchannel with fan-shaped reentrant cavities can improve heat transfer performance with an acceptable pressure drop when the Reynolds numbers are larger, and the fluid flow and heat transfer mechanism can be attributed to the interaction of the redeveloping of hydraulic and thermal boundary layers, the effect of jet and throttling and the stagnation zone of laminar flow.

80052726726	Accurate die design for automotive panel stamping considering the compensation related with die deflection and blank thinning	In order to improve assembly accuracy, automotive body panels have to be fabricated with higher dimensional and surface quality requirements, therefore the die faces should be designed more accurately to consider more relevant factors. In the presented study, we proposed algorithms to realize the following functions: through forming process simulation, the thinning distribution on the deformed blank was extracted as first kind of compensation; through die structural CAE analysis which automatically mapped the boundary contact forces onto the die surfaces from process simulation results, the die deflection was calculated as second kind of compensation. These two quantitative contributions were added together to compensate the die face. The proposed methodologies were programmed and integrated with LS-Dyna and HyperWorks, and also integrated with Autoform and CATIA linear CAE functionalities separately. In addition, a software toolkit to calculate the contacting ratio was also developed to evaluate the effectiveness of die face compensation. The second toolkit developed was verified by an automotive structural part forming die design, through die compensation and geometric optimization, the predicted contact ratio between the die face and formed blank was improved a lot, and the first toolkit was testified by a fender drawing die design. It shows that the die face compensation can be realized and integrated seamlessly between CAD model, process simulation model and die structural CAE model with the help of data I/O tools developed by the authors. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

The influence of the surfactant on the two-phase flow regime in upward inclined pipes is investigated using the electrical tomographic technique.

84859368135	Experimental and numerical study of flow and heat transfer in trapezoidal microchannels	An experimental investigation has been performed on the laminar flow and heat transfer of water in trapezoidal silicon microchannels. Two three-dimensional (3D) heat transfer models have been developed to simulate the heat transfer performance under the same experimental conditions. Due to the sudden contraction, the velocity develops a little faster, which makes the pressure drop slightly lower than that of the neglected entrance and exit plenum regions. Due to the heat conduction in the lateral parts of wafer, the maximum temperature appears near the outlet of microchannel and the temperature is slightly different among the microchannels. Nearer to the lateral parts of wafer, the the temperature reaches the maximum for the sidewall later. With a given pumping power, the thermal resistance decreases as increase of the heating power at the substrate. However, the subthermal resistance proportion is nearly unchanged. With an increase of pumping power, the subthermal resistance proportion of convection increases rapidly at first, then gradually approaches an asymptote. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84863050043	Analysis of flow and heat transfer characteristics of micro-pin fin heat sink using silver nanofluids	Silver nanofluids with three different volume fractions are prepared by a one-step chemical reduction method (Ultrasound-assisted Membrane Reaction (UAMR)). The convective heat transfer and friction characteristics of silver nanofluid in micro-pin fin heat sink are investigated experimentally. The results indicate that the pressure drops of nanofluids with different volume fractions have little difference. Compared to the base fluid (polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solution), the pressure drop of nanofluids increases slightly at the same volume flow rate. When the flow rate is small, the increment is not obvious. The introduction of surfactant increases the fluid viscosity, so the pressure drops of nanofluids are larger than those of pure water, under the same flow rate. However, the maximum difference is no more than 10%. The volume fraction of silver nanoparticles significantly affects the convection heat transfer coefficient of micro-pin fin heat sink. The presence of nanoparticles improves significantly the heat transfer performance. However, high viscosity of the nanofluids hinders the heat transfer strengthening effect of nanofluids. In the present work, when the volume fraction of silver particles reaches to 0.012%, the thermal resistance of nanofluid gradually becomes lower than that of deionized water, which indicates the integrated heat transfer enhancement of nanofluids. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

It consists of a set of separated zones adjoining parallel microchannels and transverse microchambers with spoilers. The heat transfer enhancement depends strongly on the disturbed effect by the spoilers in transverse zones. The structural parameters, including the lengths and widths of the rectangular microchannel regions and the spoilers have an important influence on the behavior of fluid flow and heat transfer in the microchannel with spoilers in transverse zones.

84870584867	Transient characteristics of a two-phase closed thermosyphon with isothermal characteristics	The structure and characteristics of the two-phase closed thermosyphon with working trap are described. A mathematical model is presented to calculate the unsteady-state start-up process of a room temperature heat pipe. The model is based on the special structure and operation conditions of the heat pipe, which is simplified to that the steam temperature in the tube changes with time only. The relation of steam temperature and time is obtained by numerical calculation and used as the temperature boundary condition of the measurement trap. The temperature, velocity and pressure distribution in the working trap are then solved by FLUENT. The main effect of ambient air on the thermometer well occurs at the orifice, while the temperature is uniform at other locations. The calculation is in good agreement with experimental data, and the maximum deviation is 3.7 K when the start-up time is 100 s. The simulation and experiments indicate that water fluid filling volume has little effect on the start-up performance of the heat pipe.

Comparing with micro circular pin fin heat sink, the heat transfer for combined micro pin fin heat sinks is improved greatly.

84874379736	Flow and heat transfer characteristics of drop-shaped micro pin-fin heat sinks with cross flow	Three drop-shaped micro pin-fin heat sinks with different tail angles were designed based on the optimization of traditional round micro pin-fin heat sink. The flow resistance and heat transfer characteristics of the heat sinks were experimentally investigated using deionized water as working fluid. The results show that the micro pin-fin with tail angle of 60° has the lowest flow resistance among the heat sinks. The streamlined structure of drop-shaped micro pin-fins improves the distribution of flow and delays the conversion from laminar to turbulent flow. The smaller the angle, the more obvious the effect. The optimal angle of drop-shaped micro pin-fin is different under different flow rates. The heat sink with tail angle of 60° has the strongest heat transfer coefficient at the corresponding Reynolds number in this experiment (Reynolds number is equal to 200-1 000). When the tail angle decreases to 30°, the heat transfer is also enhanced in the tail section of micro pin-fin. However, the flow is affected by the micro pin-fin behind, so the heat resistance is higher than other heat sinks under the same pump power.

It is found that the numerical predictions of apparent friction factor and Nusselt number are in good agreement with experimental data. The influences of periodic expansion-constriction cross sections on pressure drop, heat transfer and thermal resistance are discussed, respectively.

The thinning distribution on the deformed blank is extracted from stamping process simulation results and converted into first quantitative compensation. The boundary load required for die structural FEM analysis can be automatically mapped from process simulation results by using an updated load mapping algorithm, and the die deflection is then calculated and the deflection of die surfaces is transferred into second quantitative compensation. These two quantitative contributions are referred together for the compensation on the die surface model. The proposed methodologies have been programmed and can be integrated with LS-Dyna and HyperWorks or with Autoform and CATIA. Additionally, a software toolkit used to calculate the contacting ratio between the formed blank and die face has also been developed to automatically evaluate the effectiveness of die face compensation rather than virtually check the contacting ratio. The proposed methodologies and developed software have been verified by a case study of process and die design for an automotive panel part, showing the benefit in improving the contacting ratio. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

The observed flow patterns were intermittent flow and separated flow. For intermittent flow, gas scattered in liquid phase or liquid scattered in gas phase, and the two forms appeared in turn. For separated flow, gas flowed mainly along the wall side of gas inlet, and liquid flowed mainly along the liquid side of water inlet. There was an obvious interface between two phases and the interface fluctuated along the flow direction. According to gas phase and liquid phase superficial velocities, flow pattern maps were drawn and correlations for describing flow pattern transition in the newly proposed microchannels were obtained.

The model is based on the special structure and using conditions of the jacket-type radial heat pipe, the vapor temperature in heat pipe only changes over time. The startup performance of the heat pipe with variation input heat flux and the filling rate is analyzed. The results manifest that the filling rate increased will reduce the maximum operating temperature of the heat pipe and shorten the startup time of the heat pipe. With the increase of input heat flux, the operating temperature increases and the time to reach the steady state of the heat pipe is added. The total thermal resistance of heat pipe decreases with the increase of the input heat flux and filling rate.

The same amount of gaps and baffles are arranged along the curved channel within a certain distance. The effects of their structural parameters on mixing efficiency are presented, which include either the position and feature size of gaps and baffles, or the curvature radius of curved channel. The high efficiency mixing mechanism of the curved channel with gaps and baffles can attribute to the interaction of the increased contact area for premixed liquids, the jet and throttling effect over every unit of gap and baffle, the developing of the multidirectional vortices along the curved channel. The mixing index is sensitive to the width of the gaps and baffles for some Reynolds number ranges, but is not sensitive to the curvature radius of the curved channel. The characteristic of the pressure drop depending on Reynolds number is also investigated in order to keep an appropriate balance with mixing property. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

The micromixer consists of two split sub-channels with unequal widths and one fan-shaped cavity structure on the major sub-channel which are similar to a diamond ring structure. In order to yield optimum mixing effect, different parameters of geometry structure under a wide range of Reynolds numbers (1-80) have been investigated by numerical simulation with three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. The steady laminar flow was solved by using a finite-volume method and SIMPLE algorithm. Enhanced micromixing is achieved by utilizing a synergistic combination of unbalanced inertial collision, Dean vortices and expansion vortices. As a result of interplay between inertial, centrifugal and viscous effects, Dean vortices arise in the vertical plane of curved channel. Expansion vortices appear in the horizontal plane due to an abrupt increase of the cross-sectional area. The mixing index is used to evaluate the degree of mixing. Our studies show that vortices are observed in the channels at high Reynolds numbers. The geometry parameters of fan-shaped cavity structure affect the mixing index of micromixer. When the ratio of the widths of the major sub-channel and fan-shaped cavity channel is 1/3, the mixing index of this type micromixer could reach around 75% at Reynolds numbers larger than 60. The relation between mixing intensity and pump power consumption has been analyzed at a wide range of Reynolds numbers simultaneously. Copyright © 2011 by ASME.

Both numerical simulations and experiments were used to design and investigate the effect of parameters and flowing feature on mixing with Reynolds numbers ranging from 1 to 100.

84885623146	Heat transfer in the microchannels with fan-shaped reentrant cavities and different ribs based on field synergy principle and entropy generation analysis	This study numerically investigates performance analysis of three types of microchannels and the results obtained are compared with the open literature. The results show that the effect of different types of ribs on the overall performance is evident. The thermal enhancement factor η of the microchannels F-R (with rectangular ribs) is always the lowest, depending on the range of Reynolds number. Furthermore, different comprehensive performance criteria, based on the first and second law of thermodynamics, are proposed to assess the relative merit of each microchannel. The microchannel F-Trp (with trapezoidal ribs) is appeared to be the most promising configuration when Re < 300, while the microchannel F-C (with circular ribs) has the best performance when Re > 300. According to field synergy principle, the heat transfer enhancement can be attributed to the good synergy between velocity vector and temperature gradient. Moreover, thermal boundary is disturbed after adding ribs and temperature different between the channel wall and fluid is small, thus the corresponding of irreversibility (entropy generation) reduces and heat transfer rate improves. The present study aims to provide alternative ways to evaluate the heat transfer performance of microchannels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We observe the emergence of a cnoidal wave excited by the solitary wave. The cnoidal wave may coexist with the solitary wave for a long time associated with the periodic exchange of energy between these two nonlinear waves. The module of the cnoidal wave, which is considered as an indicator of the nonlinearity, is found to oscillate with the same period of the energy exchange. After the stage of coexistence, the interaction between these two nonlinear waves leads to the destruction of the cnoidal wave by the radiation of phonons. Finally, the interaction of the solitary wave with phonons leads to the loss of stability of the solitary wave. © 2013 American Physical Society.

Single screw expander may be a good candidate because of its many good characteristics. Precisions in manufacture and assembly are very important factors to the performance of single screw expanders. In this paper, the shaft efficiency, volumetric efficiency and gas consumption rate of the single screw expander prototypes were tested and discussed. We have manufactured three prototypes with different gaps to investigate their performance. The first prototype (A) has the largest gap, and the second one (B) has the smallest gap, the third prototype (C) has the medium gap configuration. Experimental result of the prototypes was obtained. From the experimental data of prototype A, the power output was about 5kW, the gas consumption rate was above 105kg/kWh and the volumetric efficiency was below 20%, the shaft efficiency was only 34%. From experimental data of prototype B, the mass flow rate was significantly decreased. The power output was only 1.4kW and the volumetric efficiency was slightly lower than prototype A. The gas consumption rate was much more than that of prototype A. From the experimental data of prototype C, the power output was about 4.5kW, but the mass flow rate was sharply decreased. The gas consumption rate was about 65kg/kWh, the maximum volumetric efficiency was about 66%, and the shaft efficiency was about 60%. The experimental results indicated that prototype C of single screw expanders had the best overall performance, which may be further improved by optimizing its configuration. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The investigations performed using eight coils, five different inlet velocity and four different inlet sectional liquid holdups. The effects of curvature, torsion, fluid velocity and inlet sectional liquid holdup on two-phase frictional pressure drop have been illustrated. It is found that the two-phase frictional pressure drop relates strongly to the superficial velocities of air or water, and that the curvature and torsion have some effect on the pressure drop for higher Reynolds number flows in large-scale helical rectangular channel; the inlet sectional liquid holdup only increases the magnitude of pressure drop in helical channel and has no effect on the development of pressure drop.

84899045565	Numerical simulation of flow and heat transfer in a microchannel with interrupted fan-shaped reentrant cavities	Three dimension numerical simulations were performed on laminar flow and heat transfer in a microchannel with interrupted fan-shaped reentrant cavities. In contrast to this proposed microchannel, the corresponding conventional rectangular microchannel was chosen. The numerical results indicate that the overall pressure drop effectively reduce and the ratio of friction coefficient is less than 1 because of interrupted zones. The performance of heat transfer is significantly affected by the length of interrupted zones. As the interrupted length increases, heat transfer decreases obviously. Then, according to the heat enhancement factor, (Nu/Nu

84900385185	Experimental study on the performance of the single screw expander prototype by optimizing configuration	Improving thermodynamic efficiency of prime movers is the key issue for efficient utilization of low temperature heat resources. Because of many good characteristics, the single screw expander is perhaps a good choice. Precisions in manufacture and assembly are very important factors to the performance of single screw expanders. In this paper, experimental results of the first single screw expander prototype made by ourselves was analyzed and reported for the first time. From the experimental data, the power output of the prototype was about 5kW, but the gas consumption rate was above 105kg/kWh, so the shaft efficiency was only 34% or so. The results indicated that internal leakage was very serious. Hence, the second single screw expander prototype was manufactured. The gap between gate rotor and shell of the new prototype was reduced. The gap is about 0.02mm. From the new experimental data, the mass flow rate was significantly decreased. However, the power output was only 1.4kW. So, the gas consumption rate was even more than the first prototype. The reason of bad experimental results may arise from the too large friction between screw, gate rotor and shell in the case of small gap. So, we manufactured the third single screw expander prototype, which is 0.04mm in gap. From the experimental data, the maximum power output was about 4.5kW, but the mass flow rate was decreased sharply. So the gas consumption rate was about 60kg/kWh, and the shaft efficiency was about 60%. The result indicated that the performance of the single screw expander was remarkable improved by optimizing its configuration. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.

84901196054	Flow and heat transfer characteristics for long-diamond shaped micro pin fin	The silicon long-diamond shaped micro pin fin was manufactured, and the flow and heat transfer characteristics of long-diamond shaped micro pin fin were experimentally researched and numerically simulated. The results show that within the range of Re used in experiments, the heat transfer coefficient of the long-diamond shaped micro pin fin increases with the increase of Re. For the same Reynolds number, the heat flux has no effect on heat transfer coefficient. The thermal resistance will decrease with the pump power increasing, and decrease faster when pump power is small. When the pump power increases to a certain value, the thermal resistance will remain unchanged. There is no difference in total thermal resistance for different heat fluxes. Nu increases with the increase of Re. For the diamond shaped circular micro pin fin with the same size, 45° long-diamond micro pin fin has the best heat transfer performance. The long-diamond design can avoid the vortex shedding which causes the pressure loss. Also, the long-diamond design can extend the heat transfer area and improve the conductivity of solid. Therefore it can enhance the heat transfer effect.

84907201777	Thermodynamic analysis of enhanced heat transfer process in microchannel heat sinks with complex structure	It is a typical irreversible process of flow and heat transfer in the microchannel and it is necessary to reduce the irreversibility to improve effective utilization of energy in the heat transfer process. The entropy generation rate and transport efficiency of thermal energy are derived from the first and second law of thermodynamics, which indicate that the effective utilization of thermal energy increases with the decrease of net temperature gradient of fluid in the micro heat sink. A new micro heat sink with complex structure is proposed and simulated based on the previous study. The effect of structure on entropy generation rate and transport efficiency of thermal energy is also analyzed. The results reflect that the less the net temperature gradient of fluid, the less irreversibility and the more uniform the temperature of bottom in the heat sink. Based on the definitions of thermal enhancement factor, entropy generation rate and transport efficiency of thermal energy, it is reasonable to use thermal enhancement factor to evaluate the comprehensive performance of micro heat sinks, while the other two are used to measure the irreversibility and level of utilization in the heat transfer process. In short, the evaluation criteria is provided by the first law of thermodynamics, while the essence of heat transfer enhancement is indicated by the second law of thermodynamics, giving a complete thermodynamic theory for optimizing micro heat sinks.

84909641675	Development and experimental study on organic Rankine cycle system with single-screw expander for waste heat recovery from exhaust of diesel engine	A single-screw expander with 155mm diameter screw has been developed. A spiral-tube type evaporator and an aluminum multi-channel parallel type condenser have also been developed with weight of 147kg and 78kg, respectively. Based on the development of above components, an ORC (organic Rankine cycle) system prototype was assembled and tested for waste heat recovery from diesel engine exhaust. An experimental system was built for this ORC system, and experiments were conducted for different expander torque and diesel engine loads. Influences of expander torque and diesel engine loads on the performances of ORC system were studied. The results indicated that the maximum of the power output is 10.38kW and the biggest ORC efficiency and overall system efficiency are respectively 6.48% and 43.8%, which are achieved at 250kW of diesel engine output. Meanwhile the biggest improvement of overall system efficiency is 1.53%. The maximums of volume efficiency, adiabatic efficiency and total efficiency of single-screw expander are 90.73%, 73.25% and 57.88%, respectively.

84910015694	Numerical analysis of the two-phase pressure drop and liquid distribution in single-screw expander prototype	In this paper, the numerical simulations have been carried out to evaluate the two-phase pressure drop and liquid distribution in screw channel. The numerical models are validated against the present experimental data with statistical accuracy. The effects of pitch circle diameter (PCD), inlet velocity and inlet sectional liquid holdup on the pressure drop and liquid distribution characteristics in the screw channel are illustrated. It is found that decreasing the PCD and increasing the inlet sectional liquid holdup can increase the liquid holdup on the outer side in screw channel. The PCD and the inlet sectional liquid holdup need to be considered in evaluating the two-phase frictional pressure drop per unit length in the screw channel. The PCD has an effect on the development of the average pressure in the various cross sections, and the inlet sectional liquid holdup has no visible impact on the changing process of the pressure drop in the screw channel. The correlation developed predicts the two-phase frictional pressure drop in the screw channel with great statistical accuracy.

84911472660	Flow characteristics of slug flow in helical rectangular channel	Experimental investigations on slug flow were carried out in horizontal helical rectangular channel by using high speed flow visualization. Evolution of slug in the whole helical rectangular channel was presented and the fine features of slug flow in different positions were illustrated. The slug characteristics changed along the axial direction due to the combined effects of gravitational and centrifugal force. Based on the experimental data, slug velocity, slug frequency and length distribution in different positions were given. The present topography measurement illustrated the evolution features of liquid film thickness, which was determined by the effect of centrifugal force and gravity. Liquid film falling velocity decreased as the slug moved upward and was visibly increasing in the downward flow.

84919487731	Effect of inlet/outlet types and header design on the flow distribution and heat transfer in a micro heat radiator	Different inlet/outlet types and header designs were proposed for the conventional rectangular microchannel heat radiator to obtain the optimal geometric parameters and their effects on the flow distribution and heat transfer were numerically studied. Results show that different inlet/outlet types have great impact on the characteristics of flow distribution for the micro heat radiator. Results highlight that flow distribution is relatively better for rectangular header and relatively poor flow distribution for the triangular header, and the fluid flow mechanism can be attributed to the interaction of the branching of fluid and the friction offered by the walls of the header. Type I with rectangular header is better than other cases at both fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics. It can improve the heat transfer performance and meet the demand of high heat flux cooling of microelectronic devices.

84920812092	Heat transfer performance of submerged impinging jet using silver nanofluids	Silver–water nanofluids used in this paper, has been prepared by a one step method adopting an ultrasound-assisted membrane reaction. Experimental investigations on heat transfer of submerged jet in plate and pin–fin heat sinks were carried out with different concentrations of silver nanofluids. The results indicate that the silver nanoparticles can be uniformly distributed in the base fluid with an average grain size of 4.8 nm. The used surfactant had a great influence on the viscosity of the nanofluids. Compared with the base fluid (water and surfactant), the heat transfer coefficient of the nanofluids, for the same jet velocity, increases in average by 6.23, 9.24 and 17.53 % for the silver nanoparticles weight fractions of 0.02, 0.08 and 0.12 %, respectively. Compared with water, the heat transfer coefficient is enhanced by 6.61 % with a silver nanoparticles weight fraction of 0.12 %. The Nu of pin fin heat sink are obviously higher than that of plate one, at corresponding Re. The exit of nanoparticles can intense internal energy transmission of fluids, and then enhance the heat transfer, while the Re is small.
