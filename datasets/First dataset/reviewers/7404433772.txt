Boltzmann hereditary constitutive relationship is used to model the viscoelastic behavior of lamina and the instantaneous elastic response is assumed when bifurcation occurs. The governing equations of prebuckling creep deformation and bifurcation buckling are based on DMV shallow shell theory and the Karman-Donnell geometrically nonlinear relationship. The numerical procedure and analytical deduction based on viscoelastic approach and quasi-elastic approach, respectively, are performed to investigate the behavior of prebuckling creep deformation. A semi-analytical solution strategy is adopted to obtain the critical time of bifurcation buckling. Particular attention is placed on the analysis of glass/epoxy matrix composite circular cylindrical shells, results of prebuckling creep deformation show that the time-dependent evolution of flexural deformation and circumferential membrane force is strongly dependent on the lay-up configuration of cylindrical shells. Both of them decrease in the case of cross-ply conditions and increase for symmetric angle lay-up mode with time. The boundary condition at two ends of short laminated cylindrical shells with symmetric angle lay-up plays a key role on the stability and the bifurcation creep buckling may not be observed for simply supported ends. The increase of the ratio of radius to thickness will deteriorate the long term stability of laminated cylindrical shells with constrained ends.

On the basis of the test results a new multiple rheological model was put forward to describe the strong nonlinear creep and failure course of soft rock containing the structure face by combining two non-linear components of CYJ body and L body with the classic KELVIN body and HOKE body. Then the quantitative influence of the structure face and its varying obliquity on every strain component of soft rock creep was probed into so that the nonlinear experiential regressive equations between the obliquities of the structural surface and the mechanical parameters of the multiple model or the long-term strength can be gained. The results show that the creep deformation of soft rock contains components of the instantaneous elastic, instantaneous plastic, visco-elastic and the visco-plastic deformation and the existence of the structure face would enhance the capabilities of the instantaneous plastic, visco-elastic and the visco-plastic deformation when the soft rock creeps so that it shortens the time of the stable creep phase and hastens the appearance of the third phase of soft rock creep. In the meantime, the variation of the obliquity of the structure surface will make the creep failure of soft rock in one of three modes of "X" shear failure, the sliding failure along the structure surface and the mixture failure of shear and sliding. © 2007 Central South University Press, Sole distributor outside Mainland China: Springer.

35548977110	Analysis of critical axially compressive loads for viscoelastic laminated circular cylindrical shells	The critical buckling loads of viscoelastic laminated circular cylindrical shells under axial compression are investigated within the theory of classic buckling. Boltzmann hereditary linear constitutive relationship is used to model the viscoelastic behavior of lamina. Both governing equations of Donnell type and boundary conditions in phase domain are obtained by Laplace transformation. The deflections and in-plane force functions are expressed in series form of separate variables with circumferential part in trigonometric functions. The generalized eigenvalue problem in phase domain of determining the critical axial load is studied by means of the differential scheme with respect to the axial coordinate. Applying the theorems of asymptotic value and initial value for Laplace inverse transformation, we obtain, respectively, the formulation of transient elastic critical loads and durable critical loads. The focus of this paper is on the investigation of these criticed loads. Boron fibre/epoxy and graphite fibre/epoxy materials are used in the analysis. Numerical results indicate that, in the cases of both symmetrical and antisymmetrical ply-up configuration, transient elastic critical loads and durable critical loads see similar trends of variation with ply angle and reach their maximum values at a respective ply angle of little difference regardless of boundary conditions at two ends. It may be observed, however, that the ply angles corresponding to the peak values of these two types of critical load differ by 5°-10° in the arbitrary ply-up mode and this difference is dependent on the stacking sequence, the geometric parameters and the type of material as well. The conclusions drawn in the paper can expect to be applicable to the optimal design of laminated circular cylindrical shells concerning the capability in delayed buckling.

The mechanism of the influence on the buckling behavior for ply mode, the amplitude of imperfection and boundary conditions as well can be examined by combining the discussion on the sensitivity of imperfection for the corresponding elastic counterpart.

A crucial free parameter is involved in this sort of method and required to be reasonably valued for particular application in advance since its improper choice leads to obvious errors. An optimal model to determine the free parameter is constructed in the paper and its applicability is validated by the numerical inversion of two types of simple functions. As examples to illustrate the practical implementation of proposed method, the quasi-static and dynamic analysis, within the scope of axisymmetric problem, are performed for viscoelastic laminated circular cylindrical shells under uniformly axial pressure and viscoelastic cylinder subjected to inner pressure with abrupt loading respectively. Numerical experiments show that the optimal model yields valid free parameter, and the production of free parameter and calculation time t lies in a definite range. Also it is concluded that the free parameter can be set to be inversely proportional to t with the proportional coefficient chosen among an effective range or determined directly by the result from optimal model for specific calculation time, and the range of this proportional coefficient is considered to be irrelevant to parameter T.

The thin wall structure was modeled as the lamination of finite laminas along the thickness of structure, and Kachnov's evolution kinetics was adopted to describe the progress of damage in two principal directions at any point of the laminas. The creep analysis of viscoelastic rectangular thin plates subjected to uniform transverse pressure and hinged at edges was conducted. Resulting nonlinear governing equations and boundary conditions expressed in the form of deflection and in-plane displacements of plate were discretized in space domain by means of finite difference technique, and the associated convolute integrations were obtained at discretized points by numerical integration, and finally, the iterative calculation of nonlinearly algebraic equations led to the numerical solution at each time step. Results have shown that the principal directions of stress and damage tensor can be considered time-independent during creep deformation of plates, and the deflection approaches an asymptotic value due to the redistribution of stress when the pressures on plates lie in some extent, the coupling of tension-bending, which arises from the evolution of damage along thickness, increases the creep deflection and this effect becomes more remarkable if the loads get larger. Also, the isotropic damage model gives larger deformation than anisotropic damage model does.

The values of damage variables are correlated to non-dimensional density of matrix cracks relying on the formulas from meso-mechanics approach, and the evolution equation predicting the growth rate of density of matrix cracks is assumed to follow a power type relation with transverse tensile stress. The governing equations for pre-buckling creep deformation and bifurcation buckling of laminated circular cylindrical shells under axial compression are obtained on the basis of the Donnell type shallow shell theory and Kármán-Donnell geometrically nonlinear relationship. Corresponding solution strategy is constructed by integrating finite-difference technique, trigonometric series expansion method and Taylor's numerical recursive scheme for convolution integration. The bifurcation creep buckling of symmetrically laminated glass-epoxy circular cylindrical shells with matrix creep cracking coupled are examined for various geometrical parameters and parameters of damage evolution as well as boundary conditions. The numerical results show that matrix creep cracking remarkably shortens the critic time of bifurcation buckling and reduces the durable critic loads, and its effects become weak and finally vanish with the increase of the ratio of radius to thickness in the case of short laminated circular cylindrical shells, also the influence of the matrix creep cracking is mainly dependent on the boundary conditions at two ends for moderately long circular cylindrical shells. © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

77249152203	Rheological characteristics of soft rock structural surface	There are two mechanisms of the coarse surface asperity resistance effect and rubbing resistance effect in the course of the soft rock structural surface creep, of which the former plays a dominant role in hindering the deformation in the starting creep phase, so that the structural surface creep usually displays the strong surface roughness effect, and so does the latter when the asperities in the coarse surface were fractured by shearing. Under the low stress condition, there are only two phases of the decelerating creep and the constant creep for the soft rock structural surface, and as the stress increases and overcomes the rubbing resistance, the accelerating creep failure of the structural surface will happen suddenly. Therefore, a multiple rheological model, which combines the nonlinear NEWTON body (NN) of a certain mass and the empirical plastic body (EM) with the classical SAINT VENANT body, NEWTON body, KELVIN body and HOOKE body, could be used to comprehensively describe the creep characteristics of the soft rock structural surface.

77349104072	Modeling and analysis of microtubules based on a modified couple stress theory	Based on a modified couple stress theory, a new Timoshenko beam model is established to address the size effect of microtubules (MTs) in this paper. The bending equation and the buckling equation are derived from the minimum total potential energy principle. Results obtained from the present model show that length dependence of MTs is related not only to shear effect but also to size effect, and the size effect is coupled in the shear effect, which means that the phenomenon of length dependence will disappear when the shear effect is neglected. Moreover, when very long MTs are considered, the persistence lengths are related to the internal material length scale parameter, which is different from the conclusions obtained from the classical and previous nonlocal beam models. The effect of the internal material length scale parameter on the buckling wavelength, the buckling growth rate and the buckling amplitude of the MTs is also discussed in this paper, and a comparison between present and previous results is presented. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

76949087839	Interlaminar stress distribution of composite laminated plates with functionally graded fiber volume fraction	Various functionally graded design methods have been proposed recently for fiber reinforced composite plates. The laminates with variable fiber spacing along the thickness direction are focused on in this paper. Fiber volume ratio distribution functions are defined separately in each single layer. Classic state space method as well as differential quadrature state space method are utilized here for different boundary and plied conditions. For the latter method, a sub-layer based scheme, which has both high accuracy and less numerical capacity, is suggested for functionally graded plates. Numerical examples indicate that the non-uniform distribution of fibers rearranges the stress field, of which the in-plane stresses are sensitive to the fibers' distribution, while the transverse stresses are not affected so much. In-plane stresses near interfaces would decrease if the fiber ratio reduces in this region, which provides a method to resolve the interfacial stress concentration problems. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly, a novel mixed hardening yield criterion, as an improvement of Hill's counterpart, is proposed for the orthotropic materials on the basis of the plastic theory. And differing from Hill's theory, the present yield criterion is related to the spherical tensor of stress. Then, the incremental elasto-plastic constitutive relations of the mixed hardening orthotropic materials are presented. Secondly, the incremental static equilibrium equations for laminated plates including interfacial damage are established based on Von-Karman type theory and the principle of minimum potential energy. Finally, the elasto-plastic buckling of laminated plates are solved by adopting the Galerkin method and iteration scheme. The numerical results show that buckling of the plate occurs easier due to the existence of interfacial damage, and the critical load trends to constant when the interfacial damage approaches a certain degree. Also, the effect of anisotropy on buckling is obvious and the analysis of elasto-plastic buckling is necessary. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

In order to achieve it, a new beam model is proposed, which vanishes the surface shear stress and satisfies the interfacial cohesive law automatically. Critical buckling loads and resonant frequencies of simply supported nanowires are obtained by using the Ritz method. Numerical examples indicate that the weak interface's effect reduces the overall structural stiffness, which is most significant when the inner-outer radius ratio of the shell is near 0.65. It is also found that the shear deformation and weak interface's effects only need consideration when the nanowire is not quite long, and they affect buckling behaviors more significantly than vibration characteristics. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Then, considering a simply supported laminated shallow shell with damage and under normal load, an analytical solution is presented by using finite difference method to obtain the interlaminar stresses. Numerical results show, the stiffness of the shell is weakened, greater absolute values of displacements as well as smaller interlaminar stresses are obtained by interfacial damage. When the interfacial damage is further increased, delamination occurs obviously under normal pulling load and pure shear slip occurs under normal pressure load.

Different mechanical behaviors are shown in both sides of the interface, and the discontinuation of stresses and displacements takes place in the interface. © 2011 The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.

84856602011	Buckling of yeast modeled as viscoelastic shells with transverse shearing	Yeast cells can be regarded as micron-sized and liquid-filled cylindrical shells. Owing to the rigid cell walls, yeast cells can bear compressive forces produced during the biotechnological process chain. However, when the compressive forces applied on the yeast go beyond a critical value, mechanical buckling will occur. Since the buckling of the yeast can change the networks in its cellular control, the experimental research of the buckling of the yeast has received considerable attention recently. In this paper, we apply a viscoelastic shell model to study the buckling of the yeast. Meanwhile, the turgor pressure in the yeast due to the internal liquid is taken into account as well. The governing equations are based on the first-order shear deformation theory. The critical axial compressive force in the phase space is obtained by the Laplace transformation, and the Bellman numerical inversion method is then applied to the analytical result to obtain the corresponding numerical results in the physical phase. The concepts of instantaneous critical buckling force, durable critical buckling force, and delay buckling are set up in this paper. And the effects of the transverse shear deformation and the turgor pressure on the buckling phenomena are also given. The numerical results show that the transverse shearing effect will decrease the instantaneous critical buckling force and the durable critical buckling force, while the turgor pressure will increase both of them. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84875799651	Elasto-plastic analysis of micro FGM beam basing on mechanism-based strain gradient plasticity theory	Using the consistent thermodynamic formulations, a mixed hardening plastic model based on conventional theory of mechanism-based strain gradient plasticity is built and applied in dynamic analysis of micro-functionally graded material beam. In this mixed kinematic hardening constitutive model, the plastic strain gradient only affects flow stress to reflect size effect as that in the MSG theory [1,2] based on Taylor dislocation model. No higher stress is introduced in present constitutive relations which makes it easy and straightforward to be implemented in a finite element code. By incorporating proposed constitutive model with use of subroutine UMAT in finite element ABQUS basing on implicit stress integration, the static and dynamic analysis on micro FGM beam has been carried out. Two numerical comparisons with experimental results and other numerical results demonstrate the applicability of present constitutive model on prediction of plastic behaviors of materials. In application of present constitutive model in mechanical analysis of micro FGM beam, some numerical examples are carried out for parameters analysis on mechanical properties of micro FGM beam and some useful conclusions have been obtained which are of theoretical significance for engineering application. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84877580563	Interfacial damage analysis of shallow spherical shell with FGM coating under low velocity impact	Interfacial damage would seriously reduce the structures' property, especially structures with coating when under dynamic loading. In this paper, the interfacial damage of shallow spherical shell with functionally graded material (FGM) coating subjected to low velocity impact is studied. An interfacial damage analytical model is established based on the continuum theory-based interfacial damage constitutive relations. The A.E. Giannakopoulos's 2-D functionally graded material (FGM) contact model is applied to predict contact force. Motion equations for shallow spherical shell substrate and FGM coating are obtained by Reissner variation, respectively, and the dynamic analytical model is established by using interfacial connection relations to relate the motion equations for FGM coating and those for elastic shallow spherical substrate. The orthogonal collocation point method, the Newmark method and iterative method are used synthetically to solve the whole question. In numerical examples, the dynamic response of shallow spherical shell with FGM coating and contact force are obtained, and the effects of material and geometrical parameters of FGM coating on interfacial damage and contact force have been discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84880249124	Chaotification of a nonlinear vibration isolation system by dual time delayed feedback control	Line spectrum of noise radiated from machinery vibrations of underwater vehicles is one of the most harmful signals that expose the characteristics of vehicles and locations. In order to distort the features and restrain the intensity of the line spectra, we attempt to chaotify the vibration system by time delay control. To avoid blindly numerical testing of the control parameters, stability of a two-dimensional vibration isolation floating raft system with two time-delayed feedback control is studied in this paper, aiming to provide guidance for chaotification. The system with dual equal time delay is investigated by the generalized strum method and the polynomial eigenvalues are adopted to analyze the stability of the controlled vibration isolation system with two unequal time delays. The critical control gains and delays for stability switches are obtained. By adjusting the control parameters beyond stable region, it is feasible to chaotify the system. Numerical simulations are conducted to compare the effect of two time delay with different control parameters and different control scheme to complicate the vibration isolation system. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84881106124	Unified nonlinear quasistatic and dynamic analysis of RF-MEMS switches	In this paper, the modified couple stress-based strain gradient theory is used to provide a unified nonlinear model of the quasistatic and dynamic behavior of an electrostatic microelectromechanical systems microbeam capacitive switch of the Euler-Bernoulli type. Our model not only accounts for the contact between the microbeam and the dielectric substrate using nonlinear springs and dampers, but also accounts for the system size by introducing an internal material length scale parameter. In view of the size of the microbeam and electrostatic gaps involved, Casimir and Van der Waals forces, damping force due to the squeeze membrane effect and electrostatic force with first-order fringing field effects were accounted for in our model. The resulting nonlinear system of PDEs was expanded into a coupled system using series expansion and integrated into ODEs using weighted residuals of the Galerkin type. To overcome the difficulties associated with the determination of the contact length, the Heaviside function for deflection was replaced with a Heaviside function for the contact length, and an iterative procedure was adopted to determine the contact length. To obtain the time variation of the microbeam, the dynamic system of equations was solved using Newmark's integration scheme. The outcome of our work shows the dependence of the pull-in voltage upon the inertia force, slenderness ratios of the microbeam, the electrostatic gap and the initial boundary conditions of the switch. In addition, we were also able to provide the full history of the microbeam past the pull-in threshold. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

84883433804	Nonlinear transient response of fibre metal laminated shallow spherical shells with interfacial damage under unsteady temperature fields	This paper is concerned with the transient response of fibre metal laminated (FML) shallow spherical shells with interfacial damage subjected to the unsteady temperature field. An exact displacement field which satisfies the boundary conditions on the outer and inner surfaces and stress continuity conditions at interfaces is presented. The nonlinear governing equations of motion for FML shallow spherical shells including the transverse shear deformation are established using the Hamilton's principle. The transient temperature is determined from the heat conduction equation by using the finite difference method. The collocation point method and Newmark method are adapted to solve the governing equations of motion numerically. The present model provides an effective method for nonlinear dynamic analysis of composites laminated structures with interfacial damage subjected to transient temperature fields. In the numerical examples, the transient temperature, thermal deformation and stresses of FML shallow spherical shells are presented. The transient temperature will increase from initial value with time to a steady state. The displacements and stresses of the shell increase with time and remain unchanged when the temperature is in a steady state. And the effects of interfacial damage on the mechanical behaviours of FML shallow spherical shells are also discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84890750608	Nonlinear analysis of thermally and electrically actuated functionally graded material microbeam	In this paper, we provide a unified and selfconsistent treatment of a functionally graded material (FGM) microbeam with varying thermal conductivity subjected to non-uniform or uniform temperature field. Specifically, it is our objective to determine the effect of the microscopic size of the beam, the electrostatic gap, the temperature field and material property on the pull-in voltage of the microbeam under different boundary conditions. The nonuniform temperature field is obtained by integrating the steady-state heat conduction equation. The governing equations account for the microbeam size by introducing an internal material length-scale parameter that is based on the modified couple stress theory. Furthermore, it takes into account Casimir and van der Waals forces, and the associated electrostatic force with the first-order fringing field effects. The resulting nonlinear differential equations were converted to a coupled system of algebraic equations using the differential quadrature method. The outcome of our work shows the dramatic effect and dependence of the pull-in voltage of the FGM microbeam upon the temperature field, its gradient for a given boundary condition. Specifically, both uniform and non-uniform thermal loading can actuate the FGM microbeam even without an applied voltage. Our work also reveals that the non-uniform temperature field is more effective than the uniform temperature field in actuating a FGM cantilever-type microbeam. For the clampedclamped case, care must be taken to account for the effective use of thermal loading in thedesign of microbeams. It is also observed that uniform thermal loading will lead to a reduction in the pull-in voltage of a FGM microbeam for all the three boundary conditions considered. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

By introducing an auxiliary function, which is shown in method one, the governing equations are reduced to be a single fourth-order integral- differential equation, and the exact solutions for the thermal buckling and postbuckling of symmetric laminated composite beams with combination of in-plane immovable simply supported and clamped boundary conditions are presented for the first time. On the basis of the results given in the method one, the explicit solutions for the thermal buckling and postbuckling of the beams are presented by giving accurate displacement functions (method two) and Ritz method (method three), respectively. Then, the effects of the transverse shear effects and boundary conditions on the thermal buckling and postbuckling of the beams are qualitatively discussed. What is more, a preliminary discussion on the probability and difference of extending the giving methods to the higher-order shear deformation beam theory with various boundary conditions is conducted.

84904091277	Dynamic effects of delayed feedback control on nonlinear vibration isolation floating raft systems	Vibration suppression and chaotification are the key issues in the study of the concealment capability of underwater vehicles. Time delay control is superior in chaotification, but the involved dynamics are sensitive and complex. This paper presents an analysis to obtain an analytical solution of the nonlinear delay differential equations and determine the effect of delay control on the vibration amplitude. Besides, by checking the stability of the analytical solution, dependence of chaotification upon the time delay control parameters is examined. Based on the theoretical derivation, the effects of different configurations of system parameters and delay control parameters on vibration amplitude are demonstrated in numerical simulation. What's more, the outcome of our results shows the significant role the time delay control plays in vibration suppression and chaotification. According to the analytical solution and stability analysis, not only can the appropriate delay be found to reduce the vibration amplitude, but also the suitable delay control setting can be selected for chaotification.
