84938064110	Gaming controlling via brain-computer interface using multiple physiological signals	using physiological signals to control braincomputer interface (BCI) becomes more popular. Among many kinds of physiological signals, Electrooculography (EOG) signal is more stable which can be used to control BCI systems based on eye movement detection and signal processing methods. Also, the use of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals has become the most common approach for a BCI because of their usability and strong reliability. In this paper, we described a signal processing method, which uses a wireless EEG-based BCI system designed to be worn near forehead that can detect both EEG and EOG signals, for detecting eye movements to have 9 direction controls (via EOG) and one action of execution (via EEG). This system included a wireless EEG signal acquisition device, a mechanism that can be worn stably, and an application program (APP) with signal processing algorithms. This algorithm and its classification procedure provided an effective method for identifying eye movements and attention. Finally, we designed a baseball game to test the BCI system. The results demonstrated that player can control the game well with high accuracy.

84946691163	EEG dynamics in inhibition of left-hand and right-hand responses during auditory stop-signal task	An experimental design is programmed using the presentation tool to investigate the global response inhibition process by quantifying the parameters such as inhibition efficiency, stop-signal delay (SSD) and stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) in the stop-signal paradigm. The aim of this study is to explore the response inhibition mechanisms in the left-hand and right-hand responses by using ERP and ERSP results obtained from the EEG data of different subjects. The inhibition efficiency of the right-hand response and left-hand response appears to be independent of each other as there is no significant difference between them. From these results, the inhibition mechanisms corresponding to these two regions of the brain may be viewed as statistically independent processes. Further, we inferred that the response inhibition mechanisms for both left-hand and right-hand responses have approximately the same spectral power observation analysis and we conclude that these processes are statistically independent of each other.

33745301185	An optimal nonparametric weighted system for hyperspectral data classification	In real situation, gathering enough training samples is difficult and expensive. Assumption of enough training samples is usually not satisfied for high dimensional data. Small training sets usually cause Hughes phenomenon and singularity problems. Feature extraction and feature selection are usual ways to overcome these problems. In this study, an optimal classification system for classifying hyperspectral image data is proposed. It is made up of orthonormal coordinate axes of the feature space. Classification performance of the classification system is much better than the other well-known ones according to the experiment results below.

34250738280	EEG-based assessment of driver cognitive responses in a dynamic virtual-reality driving environment	Accidents caused by errors and failures in human performance among traffic fatalities have a high death rate and become an important issue in public security. They are mainly caused by the failures of the drivers to perceive the changes of the traffic lights or the unexpected conditions happening accidentally on the roads. In this paper, we devised a quantitative analysis for assessing driver's cognitive responses by investigating the neurobiological information underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) brain dynamics in traffic-light experiments in a virtual-reality (VR) dynamic driving environment. The VR technique allows subjects to interact directly with the moving virtual environment instead of monotonic auditory and visual stimuli, thereby provides interactive and realistic tasks without the risk of operating on an actual machine. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to separate and extract noise-free ERP signals from the multi-channel EEG signals. A temporal filter is used to solve the time-alignment problem of ERP features and principle component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce feature dimensions. The dimension-reduced features are then input to a self-constructing neural fuzzy inference network (SONFIN) to recognize different brain potentials stimulated by red/green/yellow traffic events, the accuracy can be reached 87% in average eight subjects in this visual-stimuli ERP experiment. It demonstrates the feasibility of detecting and analyzing multiple streams of ERP signals that represent operators' cognitive states and responses to task events. © 2007 IEEE.

34547296519	Driver's drowsiness estimation by combining EEG signal analysis and ICA-based fuzzy neural networks	The public security has become an important issue in recent years, especially, the safe manipulation and control of vehicles in preventing the growing number of traffic accident fatalities. Accidents caused by drivers' drowsiness have a high fatality rate due to the decline of drivers' abilities in perception, recognition, and vehicle control abilities while sleepy. Preventing such an accident requires a technique for detecting, estimating, and predicting the level of alertness of a driver and a mechanism to maintain the driver's maximum performance of driving. The ICAFNN is a fuzzy neural network (FNN) capable of parameter self-adapting and structure selfconstructing to acquire a small number of fuzzy rules for interpreting the embedded knowledge of a system from the given training data set. Our experiments show that the ICAFNN can achieve significant improvements in the accuracy of drowsiness estimation compared with our previous works. © 2006 IEEE.

34548855089	Classification of driver's cognitive responses using nonparametric single-trial EEG analysis	Accidents caused by errors and failures in human performance among traffic fatalities have a high rate causing death and become an important issue in public security. The key problem causing these car accidents is mainly because that the drivers failed to perceive the changes of the traffic lights or the unexpected conditions happening accidentally on the roads. In this paper, we devised a quantitative analysis for ongoing assessment of driver's cognitive responses by investigating the neurobiological information underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) brain dynamics in traffic-light experiments in a virtual-reality (VR) dynamic driving environment. Three different feature extraction methods including Nonparametric Weighted Feature Extraction (NWFE), Principial Component Analysis (PCA), Discriminant Analysis Feature Extraction (DAFE) are applied to reduce the feature dimension and project the measured EEG signals to a feature space spanned by their eigenvectors. After that, the mapped data can be classified with fewer features and their classification results are compared by utilizing three different classifiers including Gaussian classifier (GC), k Nearest neighbor classification (KNNC), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). Experimental results show that the successful rate of Nonparametric Weighted Feature Extraction combined with Gaussian classifier is higher more than 10% compared with other combinations. It also demonstrates the feasibility of detecting and analyzing single-trail ERP signals that represent operators' cognitive states and responses to task events. © 2007 IEEE.

We used a Virtual Reality driving simulator consisted of a hydraulic hexapod motion platform to create practical driving events. We compared the EEG dynamics in response to kinesthetic stimulus while the platform was in motion, to that while the platform was stationary. The scalp-recorded EEG channel signals were first separated into independent brain sources using Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and then studied with time-frequency analysis. Our results showed that independent brain processes near the somatomotor cortex exhibited alpha power decreases across sessions and subjects. Negative potentials phase-locked to the onsets of deviation events under motion conditions were observed in a central midline component. The results allow us to better understand different brain networks involved in driving, and provide a foundation for studying event-related EEG activities in the presence of kinesthetic stimuli. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

37249063160	Development of a wireless embedded brain - Computer interface and its application on drowsiness detection and warning	The existing bio-signal monitoring systems are mostly designed for signal recording without the capability of automatic analysis so that their applications are limited.

37849187617	Adaptive EEG-based alertness estimation system by using ICA-based fuzzy neural networks	Drivers' fatigue has been implicated as a causal factor in many accidents. The development of human cognitive state monitoring system for the drivers to prevent accidents behind the steering wheel has become a major focus in the field of safety driving. It requires a technique that can continuously monitor and estimate the alertness level of drivers. The difficulties in developing such a system are lack of significant index for detecting drowsiness and the interference of the complicated noise in a realistic and dynamic driving environment. An adaptive alertness estimation methodology based on electroencephalogram, power spectrum analysis, independent component analysis (ICA), and fuzzy neural network (FNNs) models is proposed in this paper for continuously monitoring driver's drowsiness level with concurrent changes in the alertness level. A novel adaptive feature selection mechanism is developed for automatically selecting effective frequency bands of ICA components for realizing an on-line alertness monitoring system based on the correlation analysis between the time-frequency power spectra of ICA components and the driving errors defined as the deviation between the center of the vehicle and the cruising lane in the virtual-reality driving environment. The mechanism also provides effective and efficient features that can be fed into ICA-mixture-model-based self-constructing FNN to indirectly estimate driver's drowsiness level expressed by approximately and predicting the driving error. © 2006 IEEE.

79951564408	Spatial and temporal EEG dynamics of dual-task driving performance	Background: Driver distraction is a significant cause of traffic accidents. The aim of this study is to investigate Electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics in relation to distraction during driving. To study human cognition under a specific driving task, simulated real driving using virtual reality (VR)-based simulation and designed dual-task events are built, which include unexpected car deviations and mathematics questions. Methods. We designed five cases with different stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) to investigate the distraction effects between the deviations and equations. The EEG channel signals are first converted into separated brain sources by independent component analysis (ICA). Then, event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) changes of the EEG power spectrum are used to evaluate brain dynamics in time-frequency domains. Results: Power increases in the theta and beta bands are observed in relation with distraction effects in the frontal cortex. In the motor area, alpha and beta power suppressions are also observed. All of the above results are consistently observed across 15 subjects. Additionally, further analysis demonstrates that response time and multiple cortical EEG power both changed significantly with different SOA. Conclusions: This study suggests that theta power increases in the frontal area is related to driver distraction and represents the strength of distraction in real-life situations. © 2011 Lin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

This work introduces a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) combines MI and SSVEP strategies such an approach allows us to improve performance and universality of the system, and also the number of EEG electrodes from 32 to 3 in central area can increase the efficiency of EEG preprocessing to design an effective and easy way to use hybrid BCI system.

84907933114	Knowledge-based identification of sleep stages based on two forehead electroencephalogram channels	Sleep quality is important, especially given the considerable number of sleep-related pathologies. The distribution of sleep stages is a highly effective and objective way of quantifying sleep quality. As a standard multi-channel recording used in the study of sleep, polysomnography (PSG) is a widely used diagnostic scheme in sleep medicine. However, the standard process of sleep clinical test, including PSG recording and manual scoring, is complex, uncomfortable, and time-consuming. This process is difficult to implement when taking the whole PSG measurements at home for general healthcare purposes. This work presents a novel sleep stage classification system, based on features from the two forehead EEG channels FP1 and FP2. By recording EEG from forehead, where there is no hair, the proposed system can monitor physiological changes during sleep in a more practical way than previous systems. Through a headband or self-adhesive technology, the necessary sensors can be applied easily by users at home. Analysis results demonstrate that classification performance of the proposed system overcomes the individual differences between different participants in terms of automatically classifying sleep stages. Additionally, the proposed sleep stage classification system can identify kernel sleep features extracted from forehead EEG, which are closely related with sleep clinician's expert knowledge. Moreover, forehead EEG features are classified into five sleep stages by using the relevance vector machine. In a leave-one-subject-out cross validation analysis, we found our system to correctly classify five sleep stages at an average accuracy of 76.7 ± 4.0 (SD) % [average kappa 0.68 ± 0.06 (SD)]. Importantly, the proposed sleep stage classification system using forehead EEG features is a viable alternative for measuring EEG signals at home easily and conveniently to evaluate sleep quality reliably, ultimately improving public healthcare.

42249091046	Development of wireless brain computer interface with embedded multitask scheduling and its application on real-time driver's drowsiness detection and warning	Biomedical signal monitoring systems have been rapidly advanced with electronic and information technologies in recent years. However, most of the existing physiological signal monitoring systems can only record the signals without the capability of automatic analysis. In this paper, we proposed a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) system that can acquire and analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in real-time to monitor human physiological as well as cognitive states, and, in turn, provide warning signals to the users when needed. The BCI system consists of a four-channel biosignal acquisition/amplification module, a wireless transmission module, a dual-core signal processing unit, and a host system for display and storage. The embedded dual-core processing system with multitask scheduling capability was proposed to acquire and process the input EEG signals in real time. In addition, the wireless transmission module, which eliminates the inconvenience of wiring, can be switched between radio frequency (RF) and Bluetooth according to the transmission distance. Finally, the real-time EEG-based drowsiness monitoring and warning algorithms were implemented and integrated into the system to close the loop of the BCI system. The practical online testing demonstrates the feasibility of using the proposed system with the ability of real-time processing, automatic analysis, and online warning feedback in real-world operation and living environments. © 2006 IEEE.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate Electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics in response to distraction during driving. To study human cognition under specific driving task, we used Virtual Reality (VR) based driving simulation to simulate events including unexpected car deviations and mathematics questions (math) in real driving.

Then, the Event-Related-Spectral-Perturbations (ERSP) measuring changes of EEG power spectra were used to evaluate the brain dynamics in time-frequency domains. Results showed that increases of theta band (5-7.8 Hz) and beta band (12.2-17 Hz) power were observed in the frontal cortex. Results demonstrated that reaction time and multiple cortical EEG sources responded to the driving deviations and math occurrences differentially in the stimulus onset asynchrony. Results also suggested that the theta band power increase in frontal area could be used as the distracted indexes for early detecting driver's inattention in the future. ©2008 IEEE.

52949084700	Using novel MEMS EEG sensors in detecting drowsiness application	Electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis has been widely adopted for the monitoring of cognitive state changes and sleep stages because abundant information in EEG recording reflects changes in drowsiness, arousal, sleep, and attention, etc. In this study, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based silicon spiked electrode array, namely dry electrodes, are fabricated and characterized to bring EEG monitoring to the operational workplaces without requiring conductive paste or scalp preparation.

56349098254	An EEG-based subject- and session-independent drowsiness detection	Monitoring and predicting human cognitive state and performance using physiological signals such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) have recently gained increasing attention in the fields of brain-computer interface and cognitive neuroscience. Most previous psychophysiological studies of cognitive changes have attempted to use the same model for all subjects. However, the relatively large individual variability in EEG dynamics relating to loss of alertness suggests that for many operators, group statistics cannot be used to accurately predict changes in cognitive states. Attempts have also been made to build a subject-dependent model for each individual based on his/her pilot data tb account for Individual variability. However, such methods assume the cross-session variability in EEG dynamics to be negligible, which could be problematic due to electrode displacements, environmental noises, and skin-electrode impedance. Here first we show that the EEG power in the alpha and theta bands are strongly correlated with changes in the subject's cognitive state reflected through his driving performance and hence his departure from alertness. Then under very mild and realistic assumptions we derive a model for the alert state of the person using EEG power in the alpha and theta bands. We demonstrate that deviations (computed by Mahalanobis distance) of the EEG power in the alpha and theta bands from the corresponding alert models are correlated to the changes in the driving performance. Finally, for detection of drowsiness we use a linear combination of deviations of the EEG power in the alpha band and theta band from the respective alert models that best correlates with subject's changing level of alertness, indexed by subject's behavioral response in the driving task. This approach could lead to a practical system for noninvasive monitoring of the cognitive state of human operators in attention-critical settings. © 2008 IEEE.

57649211652	EEG effects of motion sickness induced in a dynamic virtual reality environment	The Electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics which relate to motion sickness are studied in this paper. Instead of providing visual or motion stimuli to the subjects to induce motion sickness, we employed a dynamic virtual-reality (VR) environment in our research. The environment consisted of a 3D surrounding VR scene and a motion platform providing a realistic situation. This environment provided the advantages of safety, low cost, and the realistic stimuli to induce motion sickness. The Motion Sickness Questionnaire (MSQ) was used to assess the sickness level, and the EEG effects on the subjects with high sickness levels were investigated using the independent component analysis (ICA). The fake-epoch extraction was then applied to the nausea-related independent components. Finally we employed the Event-Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) technology on the fake-epochs in order to determine the EEG dynamics during motion sickness. The experimental results show that most subjects experienced an 8-10 Hz power increase to their motion sickness-related phenomena in the parietal and motor areas. Moreover, some subjects experienced an EEG power increase of 18-20 Hz in their synchronized responses recorded in the same areas. The motion sickness-related effects and regions can be successfully obtained from our experimental results. ©2007 IEEE.

59849088169	EEG-based subject- and session-independent drowsiness detection: An unsupervised approach	Monitoring and prediction of changes in the human cognitive states, such as alertness and drowsiness, using physiological signals are very important for drivers safety. Typically, physiological studies on real-time detection of drowsiness usually use the same model for all subjects. However, the relatively large individual variability in EEG dynamics relating to loss of alertness implies that for many subjects, group statistics may not be useful to accurately predict changes in cognitive states. Researchers have attempted to build subject-dependent models based on his/her pilot data to account for individual variability. Such approaches cannot account for the cross-session variability in EEG dynamics, which may cause problems due to various reasons including electrode displacements, environmental noises, and skin-electrode impedance. Hence, we propose an unsupervised subject- and session-independent approach for detection departure from alertness in this study. Experimental results showed that the EEG power in the alpha-band (as well as in the theta-band) is highly correlated with changes in the subjects cognitive state with respect to drowsiness as reflected through his driving performance. This approach being an unsupervised and session-independent one could be used to develop a useful system for noninvasive monitoring of the cognitive state of human operators in attention-critical settings.

69949104687	Independent modulators mediate spectra of multiple brain processes In a VR-based driving experiment	This study explores the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) applied to normalized logarithmic spectral changes in the activities of brain processes separated by spatial filters learned from electroencephalogram (EEG) data using a temporal ICA. EEG data were collected during 1-2 hour virtual-reality based driving experiments, in which subjects were instructed to maintain their cruising position and compensate for randomly induced drifts using the steering wheel. ICA was first applied to 30-channel EEG data to separate the recorded signals into a sum of maximally temporally independent components (ICs) for each of 15 subjects. Logarithmic spectra of IC activities were then submitted to PCA-ICA to find spectrally fixed and temporally independent modulator (IM) processes. The second ICA detected and modeled independent co-modulatory systems that multiplicatively affect the activities of spatially distinct IC processes. Across subjects, we found two consistent temporally independent modulators: theta-beta and alpha modulators that mediate spectral activations of the distinct cortical areas when the participants experience waves of alternating alertness and drowsiness during long hour simulated driving. Furthermore, the time courses of the theta-beta modulator were highly correlated with concurrent changes in subject driving error (a behavioral index of drowsiness). © 2009 SPIE.

In this paper, an EEG-based neural network is proposed to assess neuroplasticity induced by musical training. A musical chord perception experiment is designed to acquire and compare the behavioral and neural responses of musicians and non-musicians. The ERPs elicited by the consonant and dissonant chords are combined together as the features of the model. The principle component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce feature dimensions and the dimension-reduced features are input to a feedforward neural network to recognize the brain potentials belong to a musician or a non-musician.

70449395227	Computational intelligent brain computer interaction and its applications on driving cognition	Driving is one of the most common attention-demanding tasks in daily life. Driver's fatigue, drowsiness, inattention, and distraction are reported a major causal factor in many traffic accidents. Due to the drivers lost their attention, they had markedly reduced the perception, recognition and vehicle control abilities. In recent years, many computational intelligent technologies were developed for preventing traffic accidents caused by driver's inattention. Driver's drowsiness and distraction related studies had become a major interest research topic in automotive safety engineering. Many researches had investigated the driving cognition in cognitive neuro-engineering, but how to utilize the main findings of driving-related cognitive researches in traditional cognitive neuroscience and integrate with computational intelligence technologies for augmenting driving performance will become a big challenge in the interdisciplinary research area. For this reason, we attempt to integrate the driving cognition for real life application in this study. The implications of the driving cognition in cognitive neuroscience and computational intelligence for daily applications are also demonstrated through two common attention-related driving studies: (1) cognitive-state monitoring of the driver performing the realistic long-term driving tasks in a simulated realistic-driving environment; and (2) to extract the brain dynamic changes of driver's distraction effect during dual-task driving. Experimental results of these studies provide new insights into the understanding of complex brain functions of participants actively performing ordinary tasks in natural body positions and situations within real operational environments. © 2006 IEEE.

70449408704	Automatic identification of useful independent components with a view to removing artifacts from EEG signal	Removal of artifacts is an important step in any research in/application of electroencephalogram (EEG). The artifacts may contain eye-blinking, muscle noise, heart signal, line noise, and environmental effect. Such noises often make the raw EEG signals not very useful for extraction/identification of physiological phenomena from EEG. The independent component analysis (ICA) is a popular technique for artifact removal in brain research and some reports demonstrate that ICA can remove the artifacts with lower (acceptable) loss of information. But, these reports select useful independent components manually, primarily by looking at the scalp-plots. This is of great inconvenience and is a barrier for BCI or real-time applications of EEG. In this paper, we demonstrate that machine learning methods could be quite effective to discriminate useful independent components from artifacts and our findings suggests the possibility of developing a 'universal" machine for artifact removal in EEG. © 2009 IEEE.

70449411137	EEG-based spatial navigation estimation in a virtual reality driving environment	The aim of this study is to investigate the difference of EEG dynamics on navigation performance. A tunnel task was designed to classify subjects into allocentric or egocentric spatial representation users. Despite of the differences of mental spatial representation, behavioral performance in general were compatible between the two strategies subjects in the tunnel task. Task-related EEG dynamics in power changes were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA), time-frequency and non-parametric statistic test. ERSP image results revealed navigation performance-predictive EEG activities which is is expressed in the parietal component by source reconstruction. For egocentric subjects, comparing to trails with well-estimation of homing angle, the power attenuation at the frequencies from 8 to 30 Hz (around alpha and beta band) was stronger when subjects overestimated homing directions, but the attenuated power was decreased when subjects were underestimated the homing angles. However, we did not found performance related brain activities for allocentric subjects, which may due to the functional dissociation between the use of allo- and egocentric reference frames. © 2009 IEEE.

71849113584	Spatial and temporal EEG dynamics of motion sickness	This study investigates motion-sickness-related brain responses using a VR-based driving simulator on a motion platform with six degrees of freedom, which provides both visual and vestibular stimulations to induce motion sickness in a manner that is close to that in daily life. Subjects' brain dynamics associated with motion sickness were measured using a 32-channel EEG system. Their degree of motion sickness was simultaneously and continuously reported using an onsite joystick, providing non-stop behavioral references to the recorded EEG changes. The acquired EEG signals were parsed by independent component analysis (ICA) into maximally independent processes. The decomposition enables the brain dynamics that are induced by the motion of the platform and motion sickness to be disassociated. Five MS-related brain processes with equivalent dipoles located in the left motor, the parietal, the right motor, the occipital and the occipital midline areas were consistently identified across all subjects. The parietal and motor components exhibited significant alpha power suppression in response to vestibular stimuli, while the occipital components exhibited MS-related power augmentation in mainly theta and delta bands; the occipital midline components exhibited a broadband power increase. Further, time series cross-correlation analysis was employed to evaluate relationships between the spectral changes associated with different brain processes and the degree of motion sickness. According to our results, it is suggested both visual and vestibular stimulations should be used to induce motion sickness in brain dynamic studies. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

76449112167	Review of wireless and wearable electroencephalogram systems and brain-computer interfaces - A mini-review	Biomedical signal monitoring systems have rapidly advanced in recent years, propelled by significant advances in electronic and information technologies. Brain-computer interface (BCI) is one of the important research branches and has become a hot topic in the study of neural engineering, rehabilitation, and brain science. Traditionally, most BCI systems use bulky, wired laboratory-oriented sensing equipments to measure brain activity under well-controlled conditions within a confined space. Using bulky sensing equipments not only is uncomfortable and inconvenient for users, but also impedes their ability to perform routine tasks in daily operational environments. Furthermore, owing to large data volumes, signal processing of BCI systems is often performed off-line using high-end personal computers, hindering the applications of BCI in real-world environments. To be practical for routine use by unconstrained, freely-moving users, BCI systems must be noninvasive, nonintrusive, lightweight and capable of online signal processing. This work reviews recent online BCI systems, focusing especially on wearable, wireless and real-time systems. © 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.

77951133678	A novel hybrid bioelectrode module for the zero-prep EEG measurements	This paper discusses a novel hybrid EEG biosensor module that measures through-hair EEG with zero preparation of the scalp. The biosensors can be donned or doffed quickly by the wearer, requiring no skin preparation, produce no skin irritation, and be comfortably worn for an extended period. The proposed EEG sensor is fabricated by the injection molding process with a flexible base and biofriendly materials. The noninvasive nature of BRCNCTU's EEG system [1] (i.e. zero skin preparation, minimal wiring) permits greater subject freedom of motion and considerably improves user compliance for such systems. This effort culminates in a biomonitoring system, measuring EEG, EOG, ECG and EMG signals for real time monitoring of human-computer interactions. ©2009 IEEE.

77952004507	Detecting frontal EEG activities with forehead electrodes	This study demonstrates the acquisitions of EEG signals from non-hairy forehead sites and tested the feasibility of using the forehead EEG in detecting drowsiness-related brain activities. A custom-made 15-channel forehead EEG-electrode patch and 28 scalp electrodes placed according to the International 10-20 system were used to simultaneously record EEG signals from the forehead and whole-head regions, respectively. A total of five subjects were instructed to perform a night-time long-haul driving task for an hour in a virtual-reality based driving simulator comprising a real car mounted on a 6 degree-of-freedom Steward motion platform and a immersive VR environment with 360 degree projection scenes. Separate independent component analyses were applied to the forehead and whole-head EEG data for each individual subject. For the whole-head independent component (IC) set, the frontal central midline (FCM) IC with an equivalent dipole source located in the anterior cingulate cortex was selected for further analysis. For the forehead IC set, the IC with its theta power changes highly correlated with subject's driving performance was selected. The EEG power changes of the selected forehead ICs were then used to predict driving performance based on a linear regression model. The results of this study showed that it is feasible to accurately estimate quantitatively the changing level of driving performance using the EEG features obtained from the forehead non-hairy channels, and the estimation accuracy was comparable to that using the EEG features of the whole-head recordings. © 2009 Springer.

77953695767	Tonic and phasic EEG and behavioral changes induced by arousing feedback	This study investigates brain dynamics and behavioral changes in response to arousing auditory signals presented to individuals experiencing momentary cognitive lapses during a sustained-attention task. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and behavioral data were simultaneously collected during virtual-reality (VR) based driving experiments, in which subjects were instructed to maintain their cruising position and compensate for randomly induced lane deviations using the steering wheel. 30-channel EEG data were analyzed by independent component analysis and the short-time Fourier transform. Across subjects and sessions, intermittent performance during drowsiness was accompanied by characteristic spectral augmentation or suppression in the alpha- and theta-band spectra of a bilateral occipital component, corresponding to brief periods of normal (wakeful) and hypnagogic (sleeping) awareness and behavior. Arousing auditory feedback was delivered to the subjects in half of the non-responded lane-deviation events, which immediately agitated subject's responses to the events. The improved behavioral performance was accompanied by concurrent spectral suppression in the theta- and alpha-bands of the bilateral occipital component. The effects of auditory feedback on spectral changes lasted 30. s or longer. The results of this study demonstrate the amount of cognitive state information that can be extracted from noninvasively recorded EEG data and the feasibility of online assessment and rectification of brain networks exhibiting characteristic dynamic patterns in response to momentary cognitive challenges. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77953157945	An intelligent telecardiology system using a wearable and wireless ecg to detect atrial fibrillation	This study presents a novel wireless, ambulatory, real-time, and autoalarm intelligent telecardiology system to improve healthcare for cardiovascular disease, which is one of the most prevalent and costly health problems in the world. This system consists of a lightweight and power-saving wireless ECG device equipped with a built-in automatic warning expert system. This device is connected to a mobile and ubiquitous real-time display platform. The acquired ECG signals are instantaneously transmitted to mobile devices, such as netbooks or mobile phones through Bluetooth, and then, processed by the expert system. An alert signal is sent to the remote database server, which can be accessed by an Internet browser, once an abnormal ECG is detected. The current version of the expert system can identify five types of abnormal cardiac rhythms in real-time, including sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, wide QRS complex, atrial fibrillation (AF), and cardiac asystole, which is very important for both the subjects who are being monitored and the healthcare personnel tracking cardiac-rhythm disorders. The proposed system also activates an emergency medical alarm system when problems occur. Clinical testing reveals that the proposed system is approximately 94% accurate, with high sensitivity, specificity, and positive prediction rates for ten normal subjects and 20 AF patients. We believe that in the future a business-card-like ECG device, accompanied with a mobile phone, can make universal cardiac protection service possible. © 2006 IEEE.

77956003584	EEG-based cognitive state monitoring and predition by using the self-constructing neural fuzzy system	Driver's cognitive state monitoring has been implicated as a causal factor for the safety driving issue, especially when the driver fell asleep or distracted in driving. In our past studies, we found that the EEG power spectrum changes were highly correlated with the driver's driving behavior performance. In this study, we attempt to construct an EEG-based self-constructing neural fuzzy system to monitor and predict the driver's cognitive state. The difficulties in developing such a system are lack of significant index for detecting drowsiness and the interference of the complicated noise in a realistic and dynamic driving environment. Our experimental results including correlation and prediction show that the performances of our proposed system are significantly higher than using the traditional neural networks. Besides, the proposed EEG-based self-constructing neural fuzzy system can be generalized and applied in the subjects' independent sessions. This unique advantage can be widely used in the real-life applications. ©2010 IEEE.

77956491012	EEG-based brain-computer interface for smart living environmental auto-adjustment	An EEG-based smart living environmental control system to auto-adjust the living environment is proposed in this study. Many environmental control systems have been proposed to improve human life quality in recent years. However, there is little research focused on environment control by using a human's physiological state directly. Even though some studies have proposed brain computer interface-based (BCI-based) environmental control systems, most of them encountered signal quality decline during long-term physiological monitoring with conventional wet electrodes. Moreover, such BCI-based environmental control systems are actively controlled by users; less close-loop feedback capability can be provided between environment and user for automation. Based on the advance of our technique for BCI and the improvement of micro-electro- mechanical-system-based (MEMS-based) dry electrode sensors, we combined these techniques to demonstrate an auto-adjustable living environment control system, e.g., illumination of light and fan speed of air conditioner, depends on the physiological change of the user, even for long-term physiological monitoring. The system is structured with five units: a wireless portable EEG acquisition circuit unit, an interactive flow control unit with a real-time physiology signal processing unit, which is implemented on a dual-core processor, an environment controller unit and a host system for data storage and display. The proposed system has been verified in a simulated environment and the experimental results show that the air conditioner and the lights can be successfully and automatically adjusted in real-time based on the subject's physiological changes, which indicate the proposed system can be implemented and constructed in the practical smart living environment or for other applications.

78649945332	Drowsiness monitoring with EEG-based MEMS biosensing technologies	Electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely adopted to monitor changes in cognitive states, particularly stages of sleep, as EEG recordings contain a wealth of information reflecting changes in alertness and sleepiness. In this study, silicon dry electrodes based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) were developed to bring high-quality EEG acquisition to operational workplaces. They have superior conductivity performance, large signal intensity, and are smaller in size than conventional (wet) electrodes. An EEG-based drowsiness estimation system consisting of a dry-electrode array, power spectrum estimation, principal component analysis (PCA)-based EEG signal analysis, and multivariate linear regression was developed to estimate drivers' drowsiness levels in a virtual-reality-based dynamic driving simulator. The proposed system can help elders who are often affected by periods of tiredness and fatigue. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.

79959391520	Driver's cognitive state classification toward brain computer interface via using a generalized and supervised technology	Growing numbers of traffic accidents had become a serious social safety problem in recent years. The main factor of the high fatalities was the obvious decline of the driver's cognitive state in their perception, recognition and vehicle control abilities while being sleepy. The key to avoid the terrible consequents is to build a detecting system for ongoing assessment of driver's cognitive state. A quickly growing research, brain-computer interface (BCI), offers a solution offering great assistance to those who require alternative communicatory and control mechanisms. In this study, we propose an alertness/drowsiness classification system based on investigating electroencephalographic (EEG) brain dynamics in lane-keeping driving experiments in a virtual reality (VR) driving environment with a motion platform. The core of the classification system is composed of dimension reduction technique and classifier learning algorithm. In order to find the suitable method for better describing the data structure, we explore the performances using different feature extraction and feature selection methods with different classifiers. Experiment results show that the accuracy is over 80% in most combinations and even near 90% under Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Nonparametric Weighted Feature Extraction (NWFE) going with Gaussian Maximum Likelihood classifier (ML) and k-Nearest-Neighbor classifier (kNN), respectively. In addition, this developed classification system can also solve the individual brain dynamic differences caused from different subjects and overcome the subject dependent limitation. The optimized solution with better accuracy performance out of all combinations can be considered to implement in the kernel brain-computer interface. © 2010 IEEE.

79959420511	An EEG-based classification system of passenger's motion sickness level by using feature extraction/selection technologies	Past studies reported that the main electrogastrography (EEG) dynamic changes related to motion sickness (MS) were occurred in occipital, parietal, and somatosensory brain area, especially in the power increasing of the alpha band (8-13 Hz) and theta band (4-7 Hz) which had positive correlation with the subjective MS level. Depend on these main findings correlated with MS, we attempt to develop an EEG based classification system to automatically classify subject's MS level and find the suitable EEG features via common feature extraction, selection and classifiers technologies in this study. If we can find the regulations and then develop an algorithm to predict MS occurring, it would be a great benefit to construct a safe and comfortable environment for all drivers and passengers when they are cruising in the car, bus, ship or airplane. EEG is one of the best methods for monitoring the brain dynamics induced by motion-sickness because of its high temporal resolution and portability. After collecting the EEG signals and subjective MS level in a realistic driving environment, we first do the data pre-processing part including ICA, component clustering analysis and time-frequency analysis. Then we adopt three common feature extractions and two feature selections (FE/FS) technologies to extract or select the correlated features such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminate analysis (LDA), nonparametric weighted feature extraction (NWFE), forward feature selections (FFS) and backward feature selections (BFS) and feed the feature maps into three classifiers (Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classifier (ML), k-Nearest-Neighbor Classifier (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)). Experimental results show that classification performance of all our proposed technologies can be reached almost over 95%. It means it is possible to apply the effective technology combination to predict the subject's MS level in the real life applications. The better combination in this study is using LDA and Gaussian based ML classifier. This advantage can be widely used in machine learning area for developing the prediction algorithms in the future. © 2010 IEEE.

79960287621	Estimating the level of motion sickness based on EEG spectra	Motion sickness (MS) is a normal response to real, perceived, or even anticipated movement. People tend to get motion sickness on a moving boat, train, airplane, car, or amusement park rides. Although many motion sickness-related biomarkers have been identified, but how to estimate human's motion sickness level (MSL) is a big challenge in the operational environment. Traditionally, questionnaire and physical check are the common ways to passively evaluate subject's sickness level. Our past studies had investigated the EEG activities correlated with motion sickness in a virtual-reality based driving simulator. The driving simulator comprised an actual automobile mounted on a Stewart motion platform with six degrees of freedom, providing both visual and vestibular stimulations to induce motion-sickness in a manner that is close to that in daily life. EEG data were acquired at a sampling rate of 500 Hz using a 32-channel EEG system. The acquired EEG signals were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) and time-frequency analysis to assess EEG correlates of motion sickness. Subject's degree of motion-sickness was simultaneously and continuously reported using an onsite joystick, providing non-stop psychophysical references to the recorded EEG changes. We found that the parietal, motor, occipital brain regions exhibited significant EEG power changes in response to vestibular and visual stimuli. Based on these findings and experimental results, this study aims to develop an EEG-based system to estimate subject's motion sickness level upon the EEG power spectra from motion-sickness related brain areas. The MS evaluation system can be applied to early detection of the subject's motion sickness and prevent its uncomfortable syndromes in our daily life. Furthermore, the experiment results could also lead to a practical human-machine interface for noninvasive monitoring of motion sickness of drivers or passengers in real-world environments. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

79960381214	EEG-based evaluation system for motion sickness estimation	Motion sickness is a common symptom which occurs when the brain receives conflicting sensory information. Although many motion sickness-related biomarkers have been identified, estimating humans' motion sickness level (MSL) remains a challenge in operational environments. Traditionally, questionnaire and physical check are the common ways to passively evaluate subject's sickness level. This study proposes a physiology-based estimation system that can automatically assess subject's motion-sickness level in operational environments. Our previous study showed that increases in self-reported MSL in a Virtual-reality based driving experiment on a motion platform were accompanied by elevated alpha (8-12Hz) power most prominently in the occipital midline electroencephalogram (EEG). This study explores the feasibility of an automatic MSL estimation based on spontaneous EEG spectrum. To this end, this study employed three different estimators: 1) Linear regression (LR), 2) Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and 3) Support vector regression (SVR). The results of this study showed that SVR outperformed LR and RBFNN in estimating MSL from EEG spectrum. The averaged accuracy of MSL estimation by SVR was 86.926.09% across 6 subjects. This demonstration could lead to a practical system for noninvasive monitoring of the motion sickness in real-world environments. © 2011 IEEE.

79960398708	A new design of the multi-channels mobile and wireless EEG system	Most researchers acquired EEG by using standard measurement system like NeuroScan system, which includes AgCl electrode cap, SynAmps Amplifier and Scan software to provide good reliability for the acquisition of EEG data. However, it is still not convenient for Brain Computer Interface (BCI) application in daily life because of needing conduction gels to contact skins and being wired, expensive and heavy. Moreover, the conduction gel will trend to be drying, so it does not suitable for long-term monitoring. In this study, we developed a mobile and wireless EEG system. The system consists of frond-end 16-channel dry electrode cap, a miniature low-power wireless portable circuitry, and a back-end program receiving events and digital EEG data simultaneously.

79960872307	Implementation of a motion sickness evaluation system based on EEG spectrum analysis	Motion sickness is a normal response to real, perceived, or even anticipated movement. People tend to get motion sickness on a moving boat, train, airplane, car, or amusement park rides. Motion sickness occurs when the body, the inner ear, and the eyes send conflicting signals to the brain. Sensory conflict theory that came about in the 1970's has become the most widely accepted theorem of motion-sickness among scientists [1]. The theory proposed that the conflict between the incoming sensory inputs could induce motion-sickness. However, some new research studies have appeared to tackle the issue of the vestibular function in central nervous system (CNS). In the previous human subject studies, researchers attempt to confirm the brain areas involved in the conflict in multi-modal sensory systems by means of clinical or anatomical methods. Our past studies had investigated the EEG activities correlated with motion sickness in a virtual-reality based driving simulator. We found that the parietal, motor, occipital brain regions exhibited significant EEG power changes in response to vestibular and visual stimuli. Based on these experimental results, we attempt to implement an EEG-based evaluation system to estimate subject's motion sickness level upon the major EEG power spectra from these motion sickness related brain area in this study. The evaluation system can be applied to early detect the subject's motion sickness level and prevent the uncomfortable syndromes occurred in advance in our daily life. © 2011 IEEE.

80054718547	Genetic feature selection in EEG-based motion sickness estimation	Motion sickness is a common symptom that occurs when the brain receives conflicting information about the sensation of movement. Many motion sickness biomarkers have been identified, and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based motion sickness level estimation was found feasible in our previous study. This study employs genetic feature selection to find a subset of EEG features that can further improve estimation performance over the correlation-based method reported in the previous studies. The features selected by genetic feature selection were very different from those obtained by correlation analysis. Results of this study demonstrate that genetic feature selection is a very effective method to optimize the estimation of motion-sickness level. This demonstration could lead to a practical system for noninvasive monitoring of the motion sickness of individuals in real-world environments. © 2011 IEEE.

The aim of this study is to investigate Electroencephalography (EEG) -based brain dynamics in response to driving distraction. To study human cognition under specific driving tasks in a simulated driving experiment, this study utilized two simulated events including unexpected car deviations and mathematics questions. The raw data were first separated into independent brain sources by Independent Component Analysis. Then, the EEG power spectra were used to evaluate the time-frequency brain dynamics. Results showed that increases of theta band and beta band power were observed in the frontal cortex. Further analysis demonstrated that reaction time and multiple cortical EEG power had high correlation. Thus, this study suggested that the features extracted by EEG signal processing, which were the theta power increases in frontal area, could be used as the distracted indexes for early detection of driver inattention in real driving. © 2011 IEEE.

In our past studies, we investigated the physiological changes in the transition of driver's cognitive state by using EEG power spectrum analysis and found that the features in the occipital area were highly correlated with the driver's driving performance. In this study, we construct an EEG-based self-constructed neural fuzzy system to estimate the driver's cognitive state by using the EEG features from the occipital area. Experimental results show that the proposed system had the better performance than other neural networks. Moreover, the proposed system can not only be limited to apply to individual subjects but also sufficiently works in between subjects. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

83555177354	Alpha modulation in parietal and retrosplenial cortex correlates with navigation performance	The present study investigated the brain dynamics accompanying spatial navigation based on distinct reference frames. Participants preferentially using an allocentric or an egocentric reference frame navigated through virtual tunnels and reported their homing direction at the end of each trial based on their spatial representation of the passage. Task-related electroencephalographic (EEG) dynamics were analyzed based on independent component analysis (ICA) and subsequent clustering of independent components. Parietal alpha desynchronization during encoding of spatial information predicted homing performance for participants using an egocentric reference frame. In contrast, retrosplenial and occipital alpha desynchronization during retrieval covaried with homing performance of participants using an allocentric reference frame. These results support the assumption of distinct neural networks underlying the computation of distinct reference frames and reveal a direct relationship of alpha modulation in parietal and retrosplenial areas with encoding and retrieval of spatial information for homing behavior. © 2011 Society for Psychophysiological Research.

84055211858	Home-based mobile cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation consultant system	Cardiovascular diseases are the most popular cause of death in the world recently. For postoperatives, cardiac rehabilitation is still asked to maintain at home (phase II) to improve cardiac function. However, only one third of outpatients do the exercise regularly, reflecting the difficulty for home-based healthcare: lacking of monitoring and motivation. Hence, a cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation system was proposed in this research to improve rehabilitation efficiency for better prognosis. The proposed system was built on mobile phone and receiving electrocardiograph (ECG) signal from a wireless ECG holter via Bluetooth connection. Apart from heart rate (HR) monitor, an ECG derived respiration (EDR) technique is also included to provide respiration rate (RR). Both HR and RR are the most important vital signs during exercise but only used one physiological signal recorder in this system. In clinical test, there were 15 subjects affording Bruce Task (treadmill) to simulate rehabilitation procedure. Correlation between this system and commercial product (Custo-Med) was up to 98% in HR and 81% in RR. Considering the prevention of sudden heart attack, an arrhythmia detection expert system and healthcare server at the backend were also integrated to this system for comprehensive cardio-pulmonary monitoring whenever and wherever doing the exercise. © 2011 IEEE.

84055221893	A vectorcardiogram-based classification system for the detection of Myocardial infarction	Myocardial infarction (MI), generally known as a heart attack, is one of the top leading causes of mortality in the world. In clinical diagnosis, cardiologists generally utilize 12-lead ECG system to classify patients into MI symptoms: 1. ST segment elevation, 2. ST segment depression or T wave inversion. However unstable ischemic syndromes have rapidly changing supply versus demand characteristics that is one of the several limitations of 12-lead ECG system for MI detection. In addition, the ECG sensor placements of 12-lead system is not easily donned and doffed for tele-healthcare monitoring at home. Vectorcardiogram (VCG) system in clinic is another type of diagnosis plot which represents the magnitude and direction of the electrical potential in the form of a vector loop during cardiac electric activity. The VCG system can easily acquire three ECG waves from X, Y, Z directions to composite vector signal in space and the VCG signals can be transferred to 12-lead ECG signal through Dower transformation and vice versa. Hence, this study attempts to develop a VCG-based classification system for the detection of Myocardial infarction. In the experiment results, the proposed system can select the proper ECG features based on cardiologist's knowledge and proposed principal moments of QRS complex. The classification performance of MI detection can be reached to 99.89% of sensitivity, 92.51% of specificity, 95.35% of positive predictive value, and 96.96% overall accuracy with maximum-likelihood classifier (MLC). © 2011 IEEE.

84862777322	Biosensor technologies for augmented brain-computer interfaces in the next decades	The study of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has undergone 30 years of intense development and has grown into a rich and diverse field. BCIs are technologies that enable direct communication between the human brain and external devices. Conventionally, wet electrodes have been employed to obtain unprecedented sensitivity to high-temporal-resolution brain activity; recently, the growing availability of various sensors that can be used to detect high-quality brain signals in a wide range of clinical and everyday environments is being exploited. This development of biosensing neurotechnologies and the desire to implement them in real-world applications have led to the opportunity to develop augmented BCIs (ABCIs) in the upcoming decades. An ABCI is similar to a BCI in that it relies on biosensors that record signals from the brain in everyday environments; the signals are then processed in real time to monitor the behavior of the human. To use an ABCI as a mobile brain imaging technique for everyday, real-life applications, the sensors and the corresponding device must be lightweight and the equipment response time must be short. This study presents an overview of the wide range of biosensor approaches currently being applied to ABCIs, from their use in the laboratory to their application in clinical and everyday use. The basic principles of each technique are described along with examples of current applications of cutting-edge neuroscience research. In summary, we show that ABCI techniques continue to grow and evolve, incorporating new technologies and advances to address ever more complex and important neuroscience issues, with advancements that are envisioned to lead to a wide range of real-life applications. © 2012 IEEE.

84863367176	Gender differences in wayfinding in virtual environments with global or local landmarks	This study assesses gender differences in wayfinding in environments with global or local landmarks by analyzing both overall and fine-grained measures of performance. Both female and male participants were required to locate targets in grid-like virtual environments with local or global landmarks. Interestingly, the results of the two overall measures did not converge: although females spent more time than males in locating targets, both genders were generally equivalent in terms of corrected travel path. Fine-grained measures account for different aspects of wayfinding behavior and provide additional information that explains the divergence in overall measures; females spent less time traveling away from the target location, a higher proportion of time not traversing, and made more rotations when stopping than males did. Rather than unequivocally supporting male superiority in wayfinding tasks, both the overall and fine-grained measures partially indicate that males and females are differentially superior when using global and local landmark information, respectively. To summarize, males moved faster than females but did not necessarily navigate the spatial surroundings more efficiently. Each gender showed different strengths related to wayfinding; these differences require the application of both overall and fine-grained measures for accurate assessment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

EEG and behavioral data were collected during 1-2. hour virtual-reality based driving experiments in which subjects were instructed to maintain their cruising position and compensate for randomly induced drift using the steering wheel. Independent component analysis (ICA) applied to 30-channel EEG data separated the recorded EEG signals into a sum of maximally temporally independent components (ICs) for each of 30 subjects. Logarithmic spectra of resultant IC activities were then decomposed by principal component analysis, followed by ICA, to find spectrally fixed and temporally independent modulators (IM). Across subjects, the spectral ICA consistently found four performance-related independent modulators: delta, delta-theta, alpha, and beta modulators that multiplicatively affected the spectra of spatially distinct IC processes when the participants experienced waves of alternating alertness and drowsiness during long-hour simulated driving. The activation of the delta-theta modulator increased monotonically as subjects' task performances decreased. Furthermore, the time courses of the theta-beta modulator were highly correlated with concurrent changes in driving errors across subjects (r = 0.77 ± 0.13). © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84865100094	Motion sickness estimation system	Motion sickness occurs when the brain receives conflicting sensory information from body, inner ear and eyes [1]. In some cases, a decreased ability to actively control the body's postural motion also causes motion sickness [2][3]. Many previous studies have indicated that motion sickness had negative effect on driving performance, and sometimes lead to serious traffic accidents due to self-control ability decline. Therefore motion sickness becomes a very important issue in our daily life especially considering driving safety. There are many attempts made by researchers to realize motion sickness, and detect motion sickness in the early stage. Although many motion-sickness-related biomarkers have been identified, estimating human motion sickness level (MSL) remains a challenge in operational environment. In our past studies, we found that features in the occipital area were highly correlated with the driver's driving performance. In this study, we designed a virtual-reality (VR) based driving environment with instinct-MSL-reporting mechanism. When a subject performed a driving task, his/her brain EEG was recorded simultaneously. From those EEG data, features associated with left motor brain area, parietal brain area and occipital midline brain area which predicted MSL were extracted by an optimal classifier implemented by an inheritable bi-objective combinatorial genetic algorithm (IBCGA) with support vector machine. Unlike traditional correlation-based method, IBCGA aims to select a small set of EEG features and maximize the prediction accuracy simultaneously in BCI applications. Once the optimal feature set predicting MSL is successfully found, a driver's cognitive state can be monitored. © 2012 IEEE.

84865682940	Generalized EEG-based drowsiness prediction system by using a self-organizing neural fuzzy system	A generalized EEG-based Neural Fuzzy system to predict driver's drowsiness was proposed in this study. Driver's drowsy state monitoring system has been implicated as a causal factor for the safety driving issue, especially when the driver fell asleep or distracted in driving. However, the difficulties in developing such a system are lack of significant index for detecting the driver's drowsy state in real-time and the interference of the complicated noise in a realistic and dynamic driving environment. In our past studies, we found that the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum changes were highly correlated with the driver's behavior performance especially the occipital component. Different from presented subject-dependent drowsy state monitor systems, whose system performance may decrease rapidly when different subject applies with the drowsiness detection model constructed by others, in this study, we proposed a generalized EEG-based Self-organizing Neural Fuzzy system to monitor and predict the driver's drowsy state with the occipital area. Two drowsiness prediction models, subject-dependent and generalized cross-subject predictors, were investigated in this study for system performance analysis. Correlation coefficients and root mean square errors are showed as the experimental results and interpreted the performances of the proposed system significantly better than using other traditional Neural Networks (p-value <0.038). Besides, the proposed EEG-based Self-organizing Neural Fuzzy system can be generalized and applied in the subjects' independent sessions. This unique advantage can be widely used in the real-life applications. © 2012 IEEE.

To overcome the limitations of traditional BCI system with conventional wet sensors, a wireless and wearable multi-channel EEG-based BCI system is proposed in this study, including the wireless EEG data acquisition device, dry spring-loaded sensors, a size-adjustable soft cap. The dry spring-loaded sensors are made of metal conductors, which can measure the EEG signals without skin preparation and conductive gel.

This study proposes a closed-loop drowsiness monitoring and management system that can estimate subjects' driving performance. The system observes electroencephalographic (EEG) dynamics and behavioral changes, delivers arousing feedback to individuals experiencing momentary cognitive lapses, and assesses the efficacy of the feedback. Results of this study showed that the arousing feedback immediately improved subject performance, which was accompanied by concurrent theta- and alpha-power suppression in the bilateral occipital areas. This study further demonstrated the feasibility of accurately assessing the efficacy of arousing feedback presented to drowsy participants by monitoring the changes in their EEG power spectra. © 2012 IEEE.

Backstepping design is a recursive procedure that combines the choice of a Lyapunov function with the design of a controller, and it presents a systematic procedure for selecting a proper controller in chaos synchronization. We further combine the systematic backstepping design and GYC partial region stability theory in this article, Lyapunov function can be chosen as a simple linear homogeneous function of states, and the controllers and the update laws of parameters shall be much simpler. Further, it also introduces less simulation error - the numerical simulation results show that the states errors and parametric errors approach to zero much more exactly and efficiently, which are compared with the original one. Two cases are presented in the simulation results to show the effectiveness and feasibility of our new strategy. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

84875468020	Chaotic motions in the real fuzzy electronic circuits	Fuzzy electronic circuit (FEC) is firstly introduced, which is implementing Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy chaotic systems on electronic circuit. In the research field of secure communications, the original source should be blended with other complex signals. Chaotic signals are one of the good sources to be applied to encrypt high confidential signals, because of its high complexity, sensitiveness of initial conditions, and unpredictability. Consequently, generating chaotic signals on electronic circuit to produce real electrical signals applied to secure communications is an exceedingly important issue. However, nonlinear systems are always composed of many complex equations and are hard to realize on electronic circuits. Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is a powerful tool, which is described by fuzzy IF-THEN rules to express the local dynamics of each fuzzy rule by a linear system model. Accordingly, in this paper, we produce the chaotic signals via electronic circuits through T-S fuzzy model and the numerical simulation results provided by MATLAB are also proposed for comparison. T-S fuzzy chaotic Lorenz and Chen-Lee systems are used for examples and are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed electronic circuit. © 2013 Shih-Yu Li et al.

84876553856	Implementation on electronic circuits and RTR pragmatical adaptive synchronization: Time-reversed uncertain dynamical systems' analysis and applications	We expose the chaotic attractors of time-reversed nonlinear system, further implement its behavior on electronic circuit, and apply the pragmatical asymptotically stability theory to strictly prove that the adaptive synchronization of given master and slave systems with uncertain parameters can be achieved. In this paper, the variety chaotic motions of time-reversed Lorentz system are investigated through Lyapunov exponents, phase portraits, and bifurcation diagrams. For further applying the complex signal in secure communication and file encryption, we construct the circuit to show the similar chaotic signal of time-reversed Lorentz system. In addition, pragmatical asymptotically stability theorem and an assumption of equal probability for ergodic initial conditions (Ge et al., 1999, Ge and Yu, 2000, and Matsushima, 1972) are proposed to strictly prove that adaptive control can be accomplished successfully. The current scheme of adaptive control - by traditional Lyapunov stability theorem and Barbalat lemma, which are used to prove the error vector - approaches zero, as time approaches infinity. However, the core question - why the estimated or given parameters also approach to the uncertain parameters - remains without answer. By the new stability theory, those estimated parameters can be proved approaching the uncertain values strictly, and the simulation results are shown in this paper. © 2013 Shih-Yu Li et al.

84883440063	Real-time assessment of vigilance level using an innovative Mindo4 wireless EEG system	Monitoring the neurophysiological activities of driver in an operational environment poses a severe measurement challenge using a current laboratory-oriented biosensor technology. The aims of this research are to 1) introduce a dry and wireless EEG system used for conveniently recording EEG signals from forehead regions, 2) propose an effective system for processing EEG recordings and translating them into the vigilance level, and 3) implement the proposed system with a JAVA-based graphical user interface (GUI) for online analysis. To validate the performance of the proposed system, this study recruited eight voluntary subjects to participate a 90-min sustained-attention driving task in a virtual-realistic driving environment. Physiological evidence obtained from the power spectral analysis showed that the dry EEG system could distinguish an alert EEG from a drowsy EEG by evaluating the spectral dynamics of delta and alpha activities. Furthermore, the experimental result of the comparison of the prediction performance using four forehead electrode sites (AF8, FP2, FP1, and AF7) implied that a single-electrode EEG signal used in the mobile and wireless EEG system is able to obtain a high prediction accuracy (∼93%). Taken together, the proposed system applied a dry-EEG device combined with an effective algorithm can be a promising technology for real driving applications. © 2013 IEEE.

84885455022	Can arousing feedback rectify lapses in driving? Prediction from EEG power spectra	Objective. This study explores the neurophysiological changes, measured using an electroencephalogram (EEG), in response to an arousing warning signal delivered to drowsy drivers, and predicts the efficacy of the feedback based on changes in the EEG. Approach. Eleven healthy subjects participated in sustained-attention driving experiments. The driving task required participants to maintain their cruising position and compensate for randomly induced lane deviations using the steering wheel, while their EEG and driving performance were continuously monitored. The arousing warning signal was delivered to participants who experienced momentary behavioral lapses, failing to respond rapidly to lane-departure events (specifically the reaction time exceeded three times the alert reaction time). Main results. The results of our previous studies revealed that arousing feedback immediately reversed deteriorating driving performance, which was accompanied by concurrent EEG theta- and alpha-power suppression in the bilateral occipital areas. This study further proposes a feedback efficacy assessment system to accurately estimate the efficacy of arousing warning signals delivered to drowsy participants by monitoring the changes in their EEG power spectra immediately thereafter. The classification accuracy was up 77.8% for determining the need for triggering additional warning signals. Significance. The findings of this study, in conjunction with previous studies on EEG correlates of behavioral lapses, might lead to a practical closed-loop system to predict, monitor and rectify behavioral lapses of human operators in attention-critical settings. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84885173797	EEG-based learning system for online motion sickness level estimation in a dynamic vehicle environment	Motion sickness is a common experience for many people. Several previous researches indicated that motion sickness has a negative effect on driving performance and sometimes leads to serious traffic accidents because of a decline in a person's ability to maintain self-control. This safety issue has motivated us to find a way to prevent vehicle accidents. Our target was to determine a set of valid motion sickness indicators that would predict the occurrence of a person's motion sickness as soon as possible. A successful method for the early detection of motion sickness will help us to construct a cognitive monitoring system. Such a monitoring system can alert people before they become sick and prevent them from being distracted by various motion sickness symptoms while driving or riding in a car. In our past researches, we investigated the physiological changes that occur during the transition of a passenger's cognitive state using electroencephalography (EEG) power spectrum analysis, and we found that the EEG power responses in the left and right motors, parietal, lateral occipital, and occipital midline brain areas were more highly correlated to subjective sickness levels than other brain areas. In this paper, we propose the use of a self-organizing neural fuzzy inference network (SONFIN) to estimate a driver's/passenger's sickness level based on EEG features that have been extracted online from five motion sickness-related brain areas, while either in real or virtual vehicle environments. The results show that our proposed learning system is capable of extracting a set of valid motion sickness indicators that originated from EEG dynamics, and through SONFIN, a neuro-fuzzy prediction model, we successfully translated the set of motion sickness indicators into motion sickness levels. The overall performance of this proposed EEG-based learning system can achieve an average prediction accuracy of ∼ 82%. © 2013 IEEE.

84886769795	HCS-Neurons: Identifying phenotypic changes in multi-neuron images upon drug treatments of high-content screening	Background: High-content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool for drug discovery. However, the discovery of drugs targeting neurons is still hampered by the inability to accurately identify and quantify the phenotypic changes of multiple neurons in a single image (named multi-neuron image) of a high-content screen. Therefore, it is desirable to develop an automated image analysis method for analyzing multi-neuron images.Results: We propose an automated analysis method with novel descriptors of neuromorphology features for analyzing HCS-based multi-neuron images, called HCS-neurons. To observe multiple phenotypic changes of neurons, we propose two kinds of descriptors which are neuron feature descriptor (NFD) of 13 neuromorphology features, e.g., neurite length, and generic feature descriptors (GFDs), e.g., Haralick texture. HCS-neurons can 1) automatically extract all quantitative phenotype features in both NFD and GFDs, 2) identify statistically significant phenotypic changes upon drug treatments using ANOVA and regression analysis, and 3) generate an accurate classifier to group neurons treated by different drug concentrations using support vector machine and an intelligent feature selection method. To evaluate HCS-neurons, we treated P19 neurons with nocodazole (a microtubule depolymerizing drug which has been shown to impair neurite development) at six concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 ng/mL. The experimental results show that all the 13 features of NFD have statistically significant difference with respect to changes in various levels of nocodazole drug concentrations (NDC) and the phenotypic changes of neurites were consistent to the known effect of nocodazole in promoting neurite retraction. Three identified features, total neurite length, average neurite length, and average neurite area were able to achieve an independent test accuracy of 90.28% for the six-dosage classification problem. This NFD module and neuron image datasets are provided as a freely downloadable MatLab project at http://iclab.life.nctu.edu.tw/HCS-Neurons.Conclusions: Few automatic methods focus on analyzing multi-neuron images collected from HCS used in drug discovery. We provided an automatic HCS-based method for generating accurate classifiers to classify neurons based on their phenotypic changes upon drug treatments. The proposed HCS-neurons method is helpful in identifying and classifying chemical or biological molecules that alter the morphology of a group of neurons in HCS. © 2013 Charoenkwan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84886512007	A hierarchical classification system for sleep stage scoring via forehead EEG signals	The study adopts the structure of hierarchical classification to develop an automatic sleep stage classification system using forehead (Fpl and Fp2) EEG signals. The hierarchical classification consists of a preliminary wake detection rule, a novel feature extraction method based on American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) scoring manual, feature selection methods and SVM. After estimating the preliminary sleep stages, two adaptive adjustment schemes are applied to adjust the preliminary sleep stages and provide the final estimation of sleep stages. Clinical testing reveals that the proposed automatic sleep stage classification system is about 77% accuracy and 67% kappa for individual 10 normal subjects. This system could provide the possibility of long term sleep monitoring at home and provide a preliminary result of sleep stages so that doctor could decide if a patient needs to have a detailed diagnosis using Polysomnography (PSG) system in a sleep laboratory of hospital. © 2013 IEEE.

84886518662	EEG-based motion sickness classification system with genetic feature selection	People tend to get motion sickness on a moving boat, train, airplane, car, or amusement park rides. Many previous studies indicated that motion sickness sometimes led to traffic accidents, so it becomes an important issue in our daily life. In this study, we designed a VR-based motion-sickness platform with a 32-channel EEG system and a joystick which is used to report the motion sickness level (MSL) in real time during experiments. The results show it is feasible to estimate subject's MSL based on re-sampling frequency band proved by the high test accuracy. A comparison between general prediction models (such as LDA, QDA, KNN) and IBCGA shows that the IBCGA can be effectively increase the accuracy. In this paper, an extended-IBCGA (e-IBCGA) is proposed and it provides more accuracy than the prior-art research. The test results show that e-IBCGA increases at least 10% to 20% test accuracy in 6 subjects. © 2013 IEEE.

The envisioned design includes: (1) independent source recover using independent component analysis (ICA) (2) automatic selection of the independent components of interest (ICi) associated with human behaviors; (3) multiple classifiers with a parallel constructing and processing structure; and (4) a simple fusion scheme to combine the decisions from multiple classifiers. Its implications in BCI are demonstrated through a sample application: cognitive-state monitoring of participants performing a realistic sustained-attention driving task. Empirical results showed the proposed ensemble design could provide an improvement of 7%∼15% in overall accuracy for the classification of the arousal state and the driving performance. In summary, constructing ICi-ensemble classifiers and combining their outputs demonstrates a practical option for ICA-based BCIs to reduce the risk of not obtaining any desired independent source or selecting an inadequate component. Most importantly, the ensemble design for integrating information across multiple brain areas creates potentials for developing more complicated BCIs for real world applications. © 2013 IEEE.

84886296402	Prediction of resting-state EEG using high-dimensional patterns	Prediction of resting-state electroencephalography (EEG)usinghigh-dimensional pattern is a challenge due to the uniqueness of each person's brainwave. This study uses the headache EEG recording as the example, and predicts the informative different states by using an intelligent feature selection method. Vomiting and nausea are usually appeared in headache attacks, andit is sensitive to light, sound, or movement. In this study, we use the EEG recording with four classes (inter-headache, pre-headache, headache and post-headache) as the medical database. This study focuses three merits: First, we establish two balanced datasets which contain 2-class (inter-headache and headache) and 4-class brainwave datasets from the original imbalanced headache database so that there is no bias of the prediction system. The 2-class dataset consists of 22 subjects and 176 trials, and the 4-class dataset consists of 40 subjects and 320 trials. Secondly, we propose an efficient SVM-based method for predicting the headache attacks from the EEGby using an inheritable bi-objective combinatorial genetic algorithm (IBCGA). IBCGA automatically selects important features from the brainwave, and the 2-class prediction accuracy of leave-one-trial-out independenttest is 81.25%. Third, from the analysis of the brain region and channel frequency, the brain region T4 is the most important brain regions and alpha and beta frequencies are the most informative frequencies. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84896473531	Independent component ensemble of EEG for brain-computer interface	Recently, successful applications of independent component analysis (ICA) to electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have yielded tremendous insights into brain processes that underlie human cognition. Many studies have further established the feasibility of using independent processes to elucidate human cognitive states. However, various technical problems arise in the building of an online brain-computer interface (BCI). These include the lack of an automatic procedure for selecting independent components of interest (ICi) and the potential risk of not obtaining a desired ICi. Therefore, this study proposes an ICi-ensemble method that uses multiple classifiers with ICA processing to improve upon existing algorithms. The mechanisms that are used in this ensemble system include: 1) automatic ICi selection; 2) extraction of features of the resultant ICi; 3) the construction of parallel pipelines for effectively training multiple classifiers; and a 4) simple process that combines the multiple decisions. The proposed ICi-ensemble is demonstrated in a typical BCI application, which is the monitoring of participants' cognitive states in a realistic sustained-attention driving task. The results reveal that the proposed ICi-ensemble outperformed the previous method using a single ICi with ∼ 7% (91.6% versus 84.3%) in the cognitive state classification. Additionally, the proposed ICi-ensemble method that characterizes the EEG dynamics of multiple brain areas favors the application of BCI in natural environments. © 2013 IEEE.

84896700513	Kinesthesia in a sustained-attention driving task	This study investigated the effects of kinesthetic stimuli on brain activities during a sustained-attention task in an immersive driving simulator. Tonic and phasic brain responses on multiple timescales were analyzed using time-frequency analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) sources identified by independent component analysis (ICA). Sorting EEG spectra with respect to reaction times (RT) to randomly introduced lane-departure events revealed distinct effects of kinesthetic stimuli on the brain under different performance levels. Experimental results indicated that EEG spectral dynamics highly correlated with performance lapses when driving involved kinesthetic feedback. Furthermore, in the realistic environment involving both visual and kinesthetic feedback, a transitive relationship of power spectra between optimal-, suboptimal-, and poor-performance groups was found predominately across most of the independent components. In contrast to the static environment with visual input only, kinesthetic feedback reduced theta-power augmentation in the central and frontal components when preparing for action and error monitoring, while strengthening alpha suppression in the central component while steering the wheel. In terms of behavior, subjects tended to have a short response time to process unexpected events with the assistance of kinesthesia, yet only when their performance was optimal. Decrease in attentional demand, facilitated by kinesthetic feedback, eventually significantly increased the reaction time in the suboptimal-performance state. Neurophysiological evidence of mutual relationships between behavioral performance and neurocognition in complex task paradigms and experimental environments, presented in this study, might elucidate our understanding of distributed brain dynamics, supporting natural human cognition and complex coordinated, multi-joint naturalistic behavior, and lead to improved understanding of brain-behavior relations in operating environments. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In order to identify the brain process of inhibition control, this study introduced a new methodology to observe brain dynamics in response and success/failure inhibition in typical and realistic scenarios. Subjects will feel stress during decision-making in scenario-compatible stop-signal tasks in bith typical and realistic scenarios. The advantage of this research would be very useful in tough condition of daily life such as, driving and sport competition or in unusual situations like gun-fighting in the field of war and flooding. This study will develop two main issues: brain activity comparing between success and failure inhibition control and comparing brain activity during decision-making in normal scenario and in stress (realistic) scenario. The findings of the present study suggest that there is an increase in stressful condition during decision-making. However EEG results indicated that, in the parietal area, the event-related potential (ERP) appeared reverse phase relative to the frontal area. Therefore, we conclude that there is obvious difference in brain dynamics activities between success/failure inhibition in typical and realistic scenarios. In this research, we purposed Gaussian-classifier for typical and realistic scenarios. The classification average accuracy was observed 77.82% in typical and 75.67 % in realistic scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.

84900462391	An EEG-based approach for evaluating audio notifications under ambient sounds	Audio notifications are an important means of prompting users of electronic products. Although useful in most environments, audio notifications are ineffective in certain situations, especially against particular auditory backgrounds or when the user is distracted. Several studies have used behavioral performance to evaluate audio notifications, but these studies failed to achieve consistent results due to factors including user subjectivity and environmental differences; thus, a new method and more objective indicators are necessary. In this study, we propose an approach based on electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate audio notifications by measuring users' auditory perceptual responses (mismatch negativity) and attention shifting (P3a). We demonstrate our approach by applying it to the usability testing of audio notifications in realistic scenarios, such as users performing a major task amid ambient noises.

84902266170	Wireless and wearable EEG system for evaluating driver vigilance	Brain activity associated with attention sustained on the task of safe driving has received considerable attention recently in many neurophysiological studies. Those investigations have also accurately estimated shifts in drivers' levels of arousal, fatigue, and vigilance, as evidenced by variations in their task performance, by evaluating electroencephalographic (EEG) changes. However, monitoring the neurophysiological activities of automobile drivers poses a major measurement challenge when using a laboratory-oriented biosensor technology. This work presents a novel dry EEG sensor based mobile wireless EEG system (referred to herein as Mindo) to monitor in real time a driver's vigilance status in order to link the fluctuation of driving performance with changes in brain activities. The proposed Mindo system incorporates the use of a wireless and wearable EEG device to record EEG signals from hairy regions of the driver conveniently. Additionally, the proposed system can process EEG recordings and translate them into the vigilance level. The study compares the system performance between different regression models. Moreover, the proposed system is implemented using JAVA programming language as a mobile application for online analysis. A case study involving 15 study participants assigned a 90 min sustained-attention driving task in an immersive virtual driving environment demonstrates the reliability of the proposed system. Consistent with previous studies, power spectral analysis results confirm that the EEG activities correlate well with the variations in vigilance. Furthermore, the proposed system demonstrated the feasibility of predicting the driver's vigilance in real time. © 2014 IEEE.

84903737731	A novel 16-channel wireless system for electroencephalography measurements with dry spring-loaded sensors	Understanding brain function using electroencephalography (EEG) is an important issue for cerebral nervous system diseases, especially for epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. Many EEG measurement systems are used reliably to study these diseases, but their bulky size and the use of wet sensors make them uncomfortable and inconvenient for users. To overcome the limitations of conventional EEG measurement systems, a wireless and wearable multichannel EEG measurement system is proposed in this paper. This system includes a wireless data acquisition device, dry spring-loaded sensors, and a sizeadjustable soft cap. We compared the performance of the proposed system using dry versus conventional wet sensors. A significant positive correlation between readings from wet and dry sensors was achieved, thus demonstrating the performance of the system. Moreover, four different features of EEG signals (i.e., normal, eye-blinking, closed-eyes, and teeth-clenching signals) were measured by 16 dry sensors to ensure that they could be detected in real-life cognitive neuroscience applications. Thus, we have shown that it is possible to reliably measure EEG signals using the proposed system.

This study translates previous laboratory-oriented neurophysiological research to design, develop, and test an On-line Closed-loop Lapse Detection and Mitigation (OCLDM) System featuring a mobile wireless dry-sensor EEG headgear and a cell-phone based real-time EEG processing platform. Eleven subjects participated in an event-related lane-keeping task, in which they were instructed to manipulate a randomly deviated, fixed-speed cruising car on a 4-lane highway. This was simulated in a 1st person view with an 8-screen and 8-projector immersive virtual-reality environment. When the subjects experienced lapses or failed to respond to events during the experiment, auditory warning was delivered to rectify the performance decrements. However, the arousing auditory signals were not always effective. The EEG spectra exhibited statistically significant differences between effective and ineffective arousing signals, suggesting that EEG spectra could be used as a countermeasure of the efficacy of arousing signals. In this on-line pilot study, the proposed OCLDM System was able to continuously detect EEG signatures of fatigue, deliver arousing warning to subjects suffering momentary cognitive lapses, and assess the efficacy of the warning in near real-time to rectify cognitive lapses. The on-line testing results of the OCLDM System validated the efficacy of the arousing signals in improving subjects' response times to the subsequent lane-departure events. This study may lead to a practical on-line lapse detection and mitigation system in real-world environments.

84923381067	Statistical analysis and classification of EEG-based attention network task using optimized feature selection	This research incorporates optimized feature selection using an inheritable bi-objective combinatorial genetic algorithm (IBCGA) and mathematic modeling for classification and analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) based attention network. It consists of two parts. 1) We first design the attention network experiments, record the EEG signals of subjects from NeuronScan instrument, and filter noise from the EEG data. We use alerting scores, orienting scores, and conflict scores to serve as the efficiency evaluation of the attention network. 2) Based on an intelligent evolutionary algorithm as the core technique, we analyze the large-scale EEG data, identify a set of important frequency-channel factors, and establish mathematical models for within-subject, across-subject and leave-one-subject-out evaluation using a global optimization approach. The results of using 10 subjects show that the average classification accuracy of independent test in the within-subject case is 86.51%, the accuracy of the across-subject case is 68.44%, and the accuracy of the leave-one-subject-out case is 54.33%
