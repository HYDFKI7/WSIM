84939208013	Cutset-angle based wide area thermal security region and its application in China Southern Power Grid	This paper presents a novel methodology for constructing wide area thermal security region (WATSR) to monitor the wide area thermal security of bulk power system under "N-1" criterion by utilizing wide area measurement system. A general cutset angle for large-scale inter-area power system is defined and developed as a measurement to assess the system thermal security so as to construct WATSR in cutset-angle space. WATSR consists of all stable operating points under "N-1" criterion, while its boundary is a complete set of all the critical points. In this paper, the boundary of WATSR is represented via its piecewise approximation with a set of hyperplanes to enhance the calculating speed. Hyperplanes are described as a set of linear equalities, which are convenient to be determined. And, because coefficients of a hyperplane can indicate the sensitivities between various control parameters, it is beneficial to power system online security assessment and control strategy optimization. A two-step algorithm is given to apply WATSR to online monitoring for bulk power system. The first step is offline calculation. The aim of this step is to determine a minimum set of hyperplanes to properly describe the boundary of WATSR. A hyperplane is a sub-segment of the security region boundary and normally corresponds to a certain constraint. The second step is online matching. Data retrieved from wide area measurement system are used to determine the relative constraints given by the hyperplanes. And then, the stability of the system can be quickly and accurately determined by the assistance of WATSR result. Once the power system turns to critical, WATSR can help the operators to optimize their control strategy. The methodology of WATSR has been successfully implemented in the China Southern Power Grid, which is known as one of the largest alternating current/direct current parallel transmission system in the world. Feasibility and effectiveness of the presented method have been validated through intensive analyses in China Southern Power Grid.

84942314709	Study on coordinated control of load and Distributed Generation	Distributed Generation ( DG ) using renewable energy to generate power in distribution networks is influenced by natural conditions, and its output power is fluctuant, affecting whole system operation. According to load voltage characteristics and features of DG, this paper presents a method of coordinated control of load and distributed generation based on Volt-Var control, and analyzes the effectiveness of the method under different conditions. It could make load changes track the output power of DG and mitigate power fluctuations by voltage regulation, so it reduces or even eliminates the influence of power fluctuation on power grid. The simulation results of the IEEE 13 nodes test feeder system by GridLAB-D simulation platform show that changes of constant impedance and constant current loads could track DG output power by voltage regulation. Furthermore, load characteristics and voltage adjustment period have some influences on the tracking effect.

15944376598	Computation of boundary of power flow feasible region with hybrid method	This paper presents a new hybrid method to compute boundaries of power flow feasible region, which is pertinent to static voltage stability analysis. The hybrid method is derived from 'predictor-corrector' framework. It converts the problem into an optimization problem, whose objective is to determine the minimum distance from an external point to the boundary of the feasible region. The proposed hybrid method can reduce the computation dimension in comparison with using 'predictor-corrector' method. In addition to visualizing boundaries in two dimension space, the method can be utilized as a powerful tool to compute the closest boundary point associated with a specific operating point. It also can be used to compute the operating limit of facilities. In order to handle concave topology on the boundary, a modification of hybrid method is also proposed. Numerical simulations on two systems illustrate that the hybrid method is reliable and effective in terms of computing the boundaries of power flow feasible region. © 2004 IEEE.

It is used to derive a voltage oscillation damping factor γ, while analytic form of γ illustrates the damping brought out by induction motor. Compared with preliminary P-H model under static load model assumption, it is evident that the induction motor plays an important role in small signal instability mode and its existence has a tendency to eliminate oscillation. The modified P-H model and γ can be used to explain negative damping phenomena coming from coexistence of slow-acting excitation systems and large capacitor compensation.

17244383144	Practical boundary expression of static voltage stability region in injection space of power systems	Static voltage stability region (SVSR) in power injection space is a promising framework for voltage security assessment and control. An accurate expression of the SVSR boundary and the fast determination of coefficients of the expression are important issues for its application in bulk power systems. In this paper, we derive the analytical expression of SVSR boundary in a single-generator-single-load system, which brings new insight into characteristics of SVSR boundary's expression. By using Taylor series expansion of the critical condition of static voltage stability, a quadratic analytical formulation is then proposed as the approximation of SVSR boundary in injection space. Furthermore, we also provide a method for critical nodes selection based on modal analysis, which aims at reducing the huge dimension of injection space. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through IEEE 14-bus, 57-bus systems and EPRI 1000-bus system. The estimation errors of the proposed boundary description in injection space are not more than 3% for various operating conditions when generators and loads change over a wide range.

22344435332	Approach of dimension reduction for visualization of practical dynamic security region	Recent years, it has been shown through a lot of research that a PDSR in injection space of a real power system is surrounded by vertical hyper-planes. Those hyper-planes are the upper and lower limits of every bus injection and one or several hyper-planes describe the critical points of transient stability in power injection space. For specific fault and specific configurations of pre-fault and post-fault power system, the PDSR is exclusive and does not change with operating states. However, the dimension of the injection power space is too high to realize visualization in 2D space or 3D space directly. Therefore this paper develops an approach to reduce the dimension of PDSR from very high to three, ensuring that after the dimension reduction, the PDSR is also approximately exclusive for a specific fault and specific configurations of pre-fault and post-fault power system and is invariable when injection power is changed. By visualizing the PDSR, the dispatchers can monitor the system security and make decision of security control more quickly and correctly. In addition, for PDSRs of different contingency in contingency set, we expect that we can observe their intersection in one reference frame, namely integrated security region. Hence this paper explores this possibility aiming at a real power system in China. At the same time, a visualization system is correspondingly developed based on above-mentioned dimension reduction technique.

21444444279	Analytical forms of boundaries of static voltage stability region with nonlinear terms	Knowledge of the stability boundary geometrical configuration is important to analyze the robustness of operating points and gives guidance for the development of control strategies and decision-making. This paper proposes a method to deeply exploit the quadratic properties of the boundary structure of static voltage stability region, which is also called power flow feasible region, in power injection space. By making quadratic Taylor series expansion of the Jacobian matrix determinant of power flow equations near critical operating points, nonlinear terms are included in the analytical boundary approximation. Eigenvalue and eigenvector sensitivities are introduced into the analysis of power flow equations and employed to the boundary approximation. An advantage of the method is that no iterative solution of nonlinear equations is required. This nonlinear analytical expression closely matches the real boundary over a wide range and greatly promotes the accuracy of present linearization method which only gives an approximation of the local part. Various examples of IEEE power systems give an illustration of the effectiveness and accuracy of the method.

33751367166	Security region based probabilistic security assessment of power transmission system à basic concepts	Without accounting for uncertainty factors in power system the security measure of traditional deterministic security assessment is uncertainty itself. So the traditional deterministic security assessment should be replaced by probabilistic steady-state and dynamic security assessment. The paper presents a security region based probabilistic steady-state and dynamic security assessment framework. In this framework, not only constraints of transient stability, static voltage stability, node voltages and line currents, but also uncertainties of power injections in load buses and in generator buses, uncertainty of load model in stability analysis and the probabilities of critical contingencies (determined by failure rates of system elements, weather forecasts, storm and lightening tracing) are considered. The mathematic descriptions of security regions make it easy to take account of the uncertainties of power injections and load model of stability analysis. The research results of probabilistic security assessment can be applied in making decision of preventive control and emergency preparation. Test results on a real transmission system of china have shown that the presented method is efficient. © 2005 IEEE.

Using a three-bus simple system, three routes that can lead power system to chaos are presented, illustrated and discussed. They are cascading period doubling bifurcation, torus bifurcation and route directly initiated by a large disturbance. Period doubling bifurcation is caused by a real Floquet multiplier going out of the unit circle from point (-1 , 0), while torus bifurcation is caused by a couple of conjugated Floquet multipliers going out of the unit circle with a non-zero imaginary part in the complex plane. Cascading period doubling bifurcation and torus bifurcation are two typical routes to chaos in dynamic systems, which have been investigated in the previous studies. The last route, i.e. directly initiated by a large disturbance, is reported and studied. This phenomenon reveals that chaos is caused by external disturbances in power systems.

33947525800	Computation of delay stability margin of electric power systems	There exist delays in the data transferring in power system PMU/WAMS (phasor measurement unit/wide area measurement system). The estimation of maximum allowed delay time that will not cause the loss of system small signal stability is important in the design of a wide-area measurement based controller. Hence in this paper, the maximum allowed delay time is defined to be the delay stability margin and a method to determine the delay stability margin is proposed. Firstly, the transcendental characteristic equation of the time-delay system is converted into a polynomial equation based on Rekasius transformation. Two equations before and after Rekasius transformation are identical when there is a system eigenvalue on the imaginary axis. Secondly, Routh stability criterion is used to determine the critical eigenvalue, the critical oscillation frequency and the delay stability margin. Finally, a single-machine infinite-bus system is used to demonstrate the proposed method. It is found that when the generation output and exciter gain increase, the delay stability margin decreases. While the impact of the generator damping to the delay stability margin is very complicated that needs further studies in future.

An expressive method is firstly introduced to describe the piecewise, continuous function. It converts the non-differential points into some poles of the derivative function. The left-hand derivative limit and the right-hand derivative limit can be used to approximate the derivatives of such poles according to the requirement. Based on this method and a simple three-bus system, the impact of the exciter limit to power system small signal stability and SSSR is then deeply discussed. It is found that the exciter limit can change elements of the system Jacobian matrix so as to cause jumping of the system critical eigenvalue. New Hopf bifurcation and new oscillation mode can be triggered when exciter voltage hits its limitation. In addition, exciter limit can cause significant topological changes to the power system SSSR. e.g. exciter limit can cause new instability hole in the SSSR and make the region boundaries more complex.

It is found that the boundaries of SSSR are not continuous smoothly and its shape can be changed roughly when the structural stability of system on the boundary is broken. The study shows that the change of characteristics of boundary of SSSR is related with degenerate Hopf bifurcation closely. The degenerate Hopf bifurcation leads to the appearance of two SSSR in 2-dimension parameter space, then attraction and coupling of the two regions result in the sudden changes of boundaries of SSSR.

84897977676	Discriminating method for OEB and ODB in time-delayed power systems based on lambert W function	Two new bifurcations in time-delayed power systems, the oscillation disappearance bifurcation (ODB) and oscillation emergence bifurcation (OEB) found in a previous study, are explored and discussed in this paper. Their definitions are given first according to the transform of the system eigenvalues. Further, an approach to determining the occurrence of ODB and OEB in time-delayed dynamic systems is proposed. It uses the information on the disappearance and emergence of the real solution branches of the Lambert W function. A typical one-dimensional time-delayed system and WSCC 3-machine-9-bus system with time delay are then selected to show the mechanism of two bifurcations and to validate the given approach. Since OEB and ODB are closely related to the emergence and disappearance of the system oscillation modes, the study under discussion is helpful to power system stability analysis with time delays. © 2014 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.

84908549274	Power system operation risk analysis considering charging load self-management of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles	Many jurisdictions around the world are supporting the adoption of electric vehicles through incentives and the deployment of a charging infrastructure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), with offer mature technology and stable performance, are expected to gain an increasingly larger share of the consumer market. The aggregated effect on power grid due to large-scale penetration of PHEVs needs to be analyzed. Nighttime-charging which typically characterizes PHEVs is helpful in filling the nocturnal load valley, but random charging of large PHEV fleets at night may result in new load peaks and valleys. Active response strategy is a potentially effective solution to mitigate the additional risks brought by the integration of PHEVs. This paper proposes a power system operation risk analysis framework in which charging load self-management is used to control system operation risk. We describe an interactive mechanism between the system and PHEVs in conjunction with a smart charging model is to simulate the time series power consumption of PHEVs. The charging load is managed with adjusting the state transition boundaries and without violating the users' desired charging constraints. The load curtailment caused by voltage or power flow violation after outages is determined by controlling charging power. At the same time, the system risk is maintained under an acceptable level through charging load self-management. The proposed method is implemented using the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) and several PHEV penetration levels are examined. The results show that charging load self-management can effectively balance the extra risk introduced by integration of PHEVs during the charging horizon.

42549135372	A simple approach to determine power system delay margin	Since there exist significant time delays in the information of phasor measurement unit (PMU) and wide area measurement system (WAMS), it is an important issue to properly evaluate the influence of time delay in power system stability study and controller design. In this paper, we mainly focus on the determination of the maximum time delay that system can sustain without losing small signal stability. Here we denote the maximum time delay as delay margin. Based on Rekasius substitution and Routh stability criterion, a simple approach to determine power system delay margin is introduced in this paper. Rekasius substitution is first used to transfer the system transcendental characteristic equation into a polynomial equation. Then Routh stability criterion is applied to determine the critical eigenvalue, the corresponding oscillation frequency and the system delay margin. Finally, a single-machine-infinite-bus system is employed to do some verification studies. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed approach are proved. Further, impacts of the exciter gain, generator mechanical output and generator damping to the system delay margin are deeply discussed. It is found that when the value of generation output and exciter gain increase, system delay margin will decrease. While relationship of generator damping and the delay margin is somewhat complex. Smaller generator damping does not mean smaller delay margin. Since time delays widely exist in the WAMS measurement, more studies should be done to properly consider their influence in future. © 2007 IEEE.

42649122297	Impact of the exciter voltage limit to power system small signal stability region	We investigate the influence of non-differential components to the power system small signal stability region in this paper. A method named unified expression function (UEF) is introduced to describe the piecewise, continuous and non-differential function in the small signal stability study. It converts non-differential points of the original function to poles of the UEF's derivative function. Then the derivative at those poles can be approximated by UEF's left-hand or right-hand derivative limits according to the requirement. Based on this method, impact of the exciter voltage limit to power system small signal stability region is then deeply discussed using a simple three-bus power system. We find that the exciter voltage limit can change elements of the system Jacobian matrix so as to cause jump of the system critical eigenvalue. As a result, two new Hopf bifurcation boundaries and a new instability hole emerge in the small signal stability region. When the exciter voltage limit varies, the new instability hole and the new Hopf bifurcation boundaries will change significantly. It makes the topological characteristics of the small signal stability region much more complicated. Since there are many non-differential components in power systems, they should be correctly considered in power system stability studies. © 2007 IEEE.

4344698788	Computing the boundary of the power flow feasible region based on the hybrid method	This paper presents a hybrid method for computing the boundary of the power flow feasible region, which is pertinent to static voltage stability analysis. The hybrid method is derived from the predictor-corrector framework and it converts the computation of boundary to an optimal problem, whose objective is to determine the minimum distance from an external point of the feasible region to the boundary. Attributing to this conversion, the dimension of the hybrid method can be reduced compared with the original predictor-corrector method. Except for benefits to visualization of boundary in two dimension spaces, the method is a powerful tool for computing the closest boundary point related to current operating point in high dimension space, as well as the limit of equipment can be induced. Considering the possibility of concave topology on the boundary, a modification to the hybrid method is proposed to deal with this issue. Finally, some numerical simulations in two different systems illustrate that the hybrid method is reliable and effective in computation of the boundary of the power flow feasible region.

With Bender's decomposition method, the optimal procedure is decomposed into two phases, namely, the capacity optimization and network reconfiguration. The former is used to determine the optimal power supply of DG island while the latter to provide an optimal reconfiguration scheme with less power loss. The two phases are integrated to achieve the final optimal scheme by feeding the sensitivity of power loss versus switches in the reconfiguration phase to the capacity optimization phase with the Bender cut.

70350550042	An approach to determine the local boundary of small disturbance voltage stability region in a cut-set power space	A new approach to determine the local boundary of voltage stability region in a cut-set power space (CVSR) is presented. Power flow tracing is first used to determine the generator-load pair most sensitive to each branch in the interface. The generator-load pairs are then used to realize accurate small disturbances by controlling the branch power flow in increasing and decreasing directions to obtain new equilibrium points around the initial equilibrium point. And, continuous power flow is used starting from such new points to get the corresponding critical points around the initial critical point on the CVSR boundary. Then a hyperplane cross the initial critical point can be calculated by solving a set of linear algebraic equations. Finally, the presented method is validated by some systems, including New England 39-bus system, IEEE 118-bus system, and EPRI-1000 bus system.

0035147965	Chaotic and bifurcation phenomena considering power systems excitation limit and PSS	Chaos in power systems is a big challenge to the conventional stability study and security control. In this paper effects of hard limit of the excitation and the loop of power system stabilizer (PSS) to the system oscillatory instability and chaos are studied. The research shows that when the limit of the excitation is considered or the parameters of PSS are adjusted properly, some Hopf bifurcation (HB) may be disappeared or very close to the system saddle node bifurcation (SNB). In small signal stability study the occurrence of HB is a precondition of the existing of chaos. If HB cannot occur, the chaos will be disappeared. When appropriately adjusting PSS, the occurrence of the Hopf bifurcation and chaos can be prevented through generating a positive electrical magnetic torque damping. The research in this paper is also a beneficial attempt to find some measures to prevent the oscillatory instability and chaos in power systems. This project is supported by National Key Basic Research Fund of China (No. G1998020307).

0035309074	Chaotic phenomena and small signal stability region of electrical power systems	In this paper, chaos phenomena and its influence on the power system small signal stability region (SSSR) are studied. We first review the studies on the SSSR, and point out that it is very important to make clear whether there exist some chaotic components on the boundary of the SSSR. Next, with some analytic skills of nonlinear dynamic system, we give a complete bifurcation diagram of a chaos existing in a sample power system, from a limit cycle (period-1) to chaotic state through cascading period-doubling bifurcation. The characteristics of the system energy varying in the continuous bifurcation are also shown. Thus a conclusion that chaos is always out of the Hopf bifurcation components (HB) on the SSSR's boundary. Based on this conclusion and some further studies, we confirm that, from the viewpoint of power system engineering, we do not need to consider the existence of chaos in the SSSR and its boundary. Therefore greatly simplifying the study of SSSR. Moreover, some aspects of the attractive regions of chaos and limit cycle are also studied, which is helpful to understanding some mistakes in some previous articles.

Sometimes the boundary of SVSR is too complex to be represented by only one hyper-plane. In this paper, an innovative method based on clustering theory is used to fit the boundary of SVSR in load injection space. Firstly, critical points of voltage collapse are calculated, whose local tangent plane's normal vectors can also be derived in the load injection space. Secondly, critical points are classified according to the similarity of normal vectors by using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering methods. Then, the boundary of SVSR is divided into couples of plane which are fitted by critical points in the same class. Base on the more accurate description of SVSR in load injection space, minimum load-shedding calculation can be done very fast with satisfied precision.

This paper introduces a new energy management strategy of islanded microgrid based on power flow control. The islanded microgrid utilizes the hybrid AC/DC structure. Battery storage system keeps the DC bus voltage constant, PV array as a current source is connected to the DC bus and a main DC/AC inverter in VF mode is used to provide the voltage and frequency references for the AC bus.

84862541605	Active power regulation of wind power systems through demand response	With the specific characteristics of low-carbon intensity and economy, wind power has been widely promoted around the world. Due to the variable and intermittent nature of wind power production, the system has to frequently redispatch generators in order to ensure the effective use of wind power whilst maintaining system security. In this way, traditional generation costs are increased and the social benefit of wind power decreases indirectly. In this paper, a new regulation strategy based on power flow tracing was proposed, taking advantage of a comfort-constrained demand response strategy to follow the fluctuations of wind farm output, with the remaining imbalance of active power compensated by traditional generators. Examples showed that compared with conventional regulation, demand response could reduce the gross operating costs of the system, and the rapid response could help maintaining system stability in case of contingency. The strategy in this paper also applies to other large-scale integration problems associated with renewable energy resources which display short-term production variability. © 2012 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84862817633	Online voltage security assessment considering comfort-constrained demand response control of distributed heat pump systems	A resilient strategy for optimal demand response control based on the management of highly-distributed electric loads is presented to meet transmission-level control aimed at maintaining voltage stability. The proposed load control scheme balances device- and grid-level objectives simultaneously, and is demonstrated for a system comprising a distributed responsive population of 14,000 residential-sized buildings integrated in a transmission system network consisting of six buses. Air-source heat pumps are implemented as the primary heating source in the responsive building population, and are introduced as a dispatchable grid-side energy resource, where aggregated output can be objectively ramped up or down through the use of an optimal centralized control strategy. A two step multi-objective optimization procedure is implemented to simultaneously satisfy balancing of the power system and customer objectives across a multi-scalar system. At the power system-level, the optimal preventive control scheme is obtained based on steady-state voltage stability constraints. At the customer-level, an optimal demand response strategy is proposed, wherein the aggregate power demand from a population of heat pumps is controlled to follow load-shedding requirements. The customer comfort is continuously maintained by constrained regulation of the thermal set-point governing operation of the heat pump device.The proposed demand-side strategy achieves similar goals to conventional approaches to regulation and spinning reserve ancillary services, but with the significant benefit of higher efficiencies. Under the proposed scheme, ancillary services provided by the electric loads effectively become virtual generators that enhance the voltage stability in power systems operating under increased uncertainty, and replace severe or multiple contingency reserves typically supplied by conventional generators. The proposed demand response control scheme can be extended to other potentially responsive end-use appliances, and opens avenues for increased exploitation of intermittent renewable energy resources while reducing operating costs and emissions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84863019321	Determination of weak points based on risk theory and application to transmission network planning	In the traditional power transmission network planning, deterministic analysis methods are widely used. In such methods, all contingencies are deemed to have the same occurrence probability, which is not reasonable. In this paper, risk assessment is introduced to the process of transmission network planning considering the probabilistic characteristics of contingencies. Risk indices are given to determine the weak points of the transmission network based on local information, such as bus risk, line overload risk, contingency severity. The indices are calculated by the optimal cost control method based on risk theory, which can help planners to quickly determine weak points in the planning and find solution to them. For simplification, only line overload violation is considered. Finally, the proposed method is validated by an IEEE-RTS test system and a real power system in China from two aspects. In the first case, the original system is evaluated by the proposed method to find the weak points, and then four planning schemes are established, among which the best scheme is selected. In the second case, four initial planning schemes are established by combining the experiences of planners, and after the evaluation by using the proposed method, the best planning scheme is improved based on the information of weak points in the initial schemes, and the risk of improved scheme is reduced from 42 531.86 MWh per year to 4 431.26 MWh per year. © 2012 Tianjin University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84864858094	A novel method to optimize the active crowbar resistance for low voltage ride through operation of doubly-fed induction generator based on wind energy	Nowadays, wind power has been developed very fast in China and the installed capacity of wind turbine has been increased rapidly. As an important wind driven generator, doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) has been applied very popularly for its many advantages, such as less converter losses and simpler control methods. When the grid voltage dip occurs, a crowbar beside the rotor-side converter is usually activated. Unfortunately, the selection of the crowbar resistance is a new problem for great influence by non-linear circuit parameters. It must be large enough to limit the fault current in the rotor, meanwhile it can't induce high voltage ripple in the DC-link circuit. In terms of such requirements, this paper proposes a novel strategy to optimize the resistance of the crowbar. In the objective function, the rotor current and DC-link voltage are used as the criteria and an index is set to reflect the influence of these two variables, then an optimized crowbar resistance which makes the best response of this system is obtained. Simulation executed in MATLAB/SIMULINK is proposed to validate relevant theoretical investigation, which indicates the new algorithm is effective to find the best crowbar resistance for low voltage ride through (LVRT) operation. © 2012 IEEE.

0038137245	Power system instability and chaos	In this paper routes to chaotic oscillation in power systems and relationships between chaos and various power system instability modes are deeply studied. Firstly, using a three-bus simple system, three routes may cause power systems to chaos are illustrated and discussed. They are route of cascading period doubling bifurcation (PDB), route of torus bifurcation (TB) and route of directly initiated by a large disturbance of energy. The route of cascading PDB is a typical route to chaos, where PDB is caused by a real Floquet multiplier (FM) moving counter to the real axis and going out of the unit circle from point (-1, 0) in the complex plane. TB is caused by a couple of conjugate FMs going out of the unit circle with a nonzero imaginary part in the complex plane. Chaos caused by TB has some interesting features, such as self-organizing phenomenon, coexistence of divergent and chaotic subspaces, etc. The last route, which is directly initiated by a large disturbance of energy, is reported and studied for the first time so far as we know. Secondly, relationships between chaos and various instability modes are discussed. Also using a simple system, we illustrate the scenes that chaos leads power system to voltage collapse, angle divergence, or voltage collapse with angle divergence simultaneously when the stability conditions of the chaotic oscillation are broken. It tells us that chaos is very likely to be an intergrade existing in the transient stage after a large disturbance. In order to prevent the appearance of instability incidents effectively, it is necessary to keep up on the study of chaotic phenomena in power systems. All these studies are helpful to deeply understand the mechanism of various instability modes and to find effective anti-chaos strategies. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, due to the nonlinear nature of power system, linear estimate value may be erroneous, especially for some serious contingencies. In this paper, Thevenin equivalent of key ports and its fast modification as branch parameter varies is used to observe how the state variable impacted by the change of branch parameter. And then the relationship between the state variables and branch parameter is fitted by a set of quadratic functions. With the nonlinear information between the state variable and branch parameter, traditional linear sensitivity is corrected to get a more accurate estimate. As the branch parameter varies, the correction of Thevenin equivalent of key ports only needs a small amount of additional computation, and the calculation burden does not increase significantly with larger system, so this approach remains high computational efficiency.

Monte Carlo simulation is implemented to the statistical model to obtain the capacity distributions of BSHS. Finally, a benchmark low voltage microgrid is established as the test system using the commercial software DIgSILENT. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the hysteretic loop control strategy and the capacity statistical model. The obtained capacity distributions of BSHS are used to determine the optimum capacity according to the needs of operation. The results also show that the hysteretic loop control strategy can reduce the capacity of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) while increase the capacity of Supercapacitor Storage System (SCSS). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84886613074	A Spatial-Temporal model for grid impact analysis of plug-in electric vehicles	A Spatial-Temporal model (STM) was developed to evaluate the impact of large scale deployment of plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) on urban distribution networks. The STM runs based on the integration of power system analysis and transportation analysis. Origin-Destination (OD) analysis from intelligent transportation research was used to model the EV mobility. Based on the EV technical and market information provided by the EU MERGE project and the output of OD analysis, a Monte Carlo simulation method was developed within the STM to obtain the EV charging load of each load busbar over time. The STM aims to facilitate power system evaluation and planning, and is able to provide both average values and probabilities of nodal bus voltages and branch loadings. The STM is able to identify the critical network components that will require to be upgraded. A high customer density urban network from the United Kingdom Generic Distribution System combined with geographic information was used as a test system. Two EV charging strategies, "dumb" charging and "smart" charging, were simulated and compared under different EV penetration levels (0%, 25% and 50%) to verify the effectiveness of STM. © 2013 The Authors.

84887533723	A novel reconfiguration strategy for active distribution network considering maximum power supply capability	In this paper, a novel reconfiguration strategy for active distribution network considering maximum power supply capability (PSC) is proposed. Firstly, a PSC index (PSCI) is proposed to evaluate the real-time security level of distribution network. Then, a novel reconfiguration strategy is developed for enhancing the PSCI of distribution network when the PSCI is lower than a pre-defined warning value. The reconfiguration strategy can be integrated to distribution management system (DMS) as a preventive control method to prevent outages of customers, which can significantly increase the reliability of distribution network. Case studies are carried out by using a typical 33-bus distribution network, and simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed reconfiguration strategy, which has a good engineering application prospect. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84887538345	An improved delay-dependent stability criterion for power system with double time delays	In this paper, a Direct Method-based delay-dependent stability criterion is presented. Initially, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional of power system with double time delays is simplified, then the derivative of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional along time is converted into the pattern of linear matrix inequality (abbreviated as LMI). During the process of derivative construction, an integral inequality is introduced to magnify the derivative, thus no free-weighting matrix is utilized in the new criterion. It can be proved that the new criterion, in comparison with the former ones with free-weighting matrix, has the same conservativeness and much fewer unknown variables. Finally, the proposed criterion's effectiveness is validated by the typical second-order delay system and WSCC-3-generator-9-bus system. Numerical results indicate that the proposed criterion can obtain the same stability margin with the former ones with free-weighting matrix, but the improved criterion can remarkably curtail the calculation time. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84893207723	Hierarchical risk assessment of transmission network considering the influence of micro-grid	Transmission network risk is calculated by multiplying occurrence probability and consequence of contingencies. Since power flow in the traditional distribution system is unidirectional, its loads are usually aggregated into an equal load and connected to the transmission network through a substation in the traditional risk assessment. And, all loads are simply treated as constant-power type. Details of distribution network and loads are usually ignored. However, today a growing number of distributed generators (DGs) based on renewable resources being connected to modern power systems. How to properly evaluate their influence on risk assessment of transmission network should be considered. Micro-grid has been regarded as a good way to integrate various renewable resources into distribution network. It can increase DG's penetration and reduce its negative impact. However, micro-grid can be considered as a controllable load or a small virtual power plant, so it can significantly change characteristics of distribution loads and operational modes of distribution network. In this paper, micro- grid is used as a tool to reduce load curtailment under some critical contingencies. And its influence on risk assessment of transmission network is then analyzed and discussed. In the study, a linear optimization method is used to determine the load curtailment. Discrete probability model of DGs in micro-grid and detailed model of distribution system are taken into account in the optimal process, such as island, tie switches, links, etc. Risk calculation of whole power system is executed though iterations between transmission network and distribution system. Load curtailment expectation instead of absolute load curtailment is used to risk calculation. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method is finally validated by RTS and RBTS test system. © 2013 IEEE.

84894551319	A model simplification method for solving stability margin of power system with single time-delay	In the process of solving the power system time-delay stability via the linear matrix inequality (LMI) criterion, the high dimensions in the dynamic model of power systems may result in the over abundance of unknown variables and unacceptable length of calculation time. In order to surmount this difficulty, this paper initially converts the power system linear model with single time-delay to a state-space model with the input and output component. Furthermore, the extended model is simplified via the well-developed state-space based model reduction method. As a consequence, the quantity of unknown variables will substantially decrease while the system's crucial dynamic features are reserved. Finally, on the basis of the simplified model, the LMI technique and the parameter transform tool, a new time-delay stability criterion with better performance, is obtained. The proposed method is used in the WSCC 3-machine 9-bus and IEEE 10-machine 39-bus system with single time-delay component, and a comparison of stability margin solving results between the two systems is made with the binary search method. The numerical results indicate that the simplified model of time-delay system generates fewer errors in the calculation of stability margin than those of the model without simplification, but the calculation time is remarkably reduced. © 2014 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.

84894304347	A differentiation based method to transmission network planning for improving anti-disaster ability	Frequent occurrences of meteorological disasters (MD) in recent years have revealed the deficiencies of traditional transmission network planning (TNP) methods, which fail to establish mathematical relationship between the MD and the transmission line outage rate (TLOR) when calculating the vulnerability index of transmission network. As a result, the planning schemes are usually unable to determine the critical lines that should be guaranteed in the event of MDs, which is against the basic principles of economy and reliability. In this paper, a differentiation based method to TNP is proposed to optimize the fortification standard levels of different transmission lines for improving the anti-disaster ability. A three-state meteorological model is firstly developed to evaluate the effect of MD on TLOR; then a multi-objective TNP model is built considering economy and vulnerability objectives. Results show the TNP method can determine the fortification standard level of each transmission line for improving the anti-disaster ability while minimize the construction cost as much as possible, which is of significant reference value to the TNP under the meteorological disaster-prone environment. © 2013 IEEE.

84894341905	Studies on the section thermal limits based on security region	This paper proposes a method for calculating and analyzing section thermal limits under the condition of the security 'N-1' criterion and forms the security region in multi-dimensional space. By calculating each generator's power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) on section lines, using the DC load flow model, the sensitive generators to the section thermal limits can be identified. With sensitive generators output as the axes of multi-dimensional space, the thermal limit points can be obtained under the condition of the security 'N-1' criterion. Then the thermal stability security boundary is formed when those thermal limit points are fitted in the multi-dimensional space. The thermal stability security boundary depicts the variation of section thermal limits with each sensitive factor output change and reflects the specific impact of sensitive factors to section thermal limits. The proposed method has been applied in a real power grid in the south of China. © 2013 IEEE.

84897129398	Economic assessment of future transmission line base on probabilistic power flow	It is necessary to conduct economical assessment on the planned scheme during the development of transmission network expansion planning. In view of the fact that the revenue of transmission network is largely depended on the wheeling charge and the flow rate flowing through the transmission lines, a probabilistic power flow method to estimate the flow rate of the future transmission line is proposed to assist the power network planner in assessment of economy benefit of the planning scheme. Considering such uncertain factors as probabilistic distribution of future load, correlativity among loads, probability of generator outage and unit commitment and utilizing Monte Carlo sampling method, a calculation model for the wheeling flow rate passing through the future transmission line is built. Based on the proposed method, the income from wheeling charge can be effectively analyzed, and further the economic benefit index such as net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and pay back time (PBT) can be calculated to guide the economic assessment of power network planning scheme. The effectiveness and application value of the proposed method are validated by the results of case analysis of New England testing system.

84899667544	Study on N-k risk based grid-connection and capacity allocation of wind farm and energy storage system	With rapid development of wind power generation in China, reasonably selecting the grid-connection point of wind farm and optimally configuring the capacity of wind power generation system and energy storage system make positive contribution to both planning and operation of power grid. In view of the fluctuation and intermittence of wind energy, the deterministic analysis method is restricted, however the risk analysis method can model the randomness of wind speed. Taking the post-outage power flow transferring as the selection principle of N-k outage and considering the impact of grid power flow level on outage occurrence probability, the N-k risk analysis method is used to research different grid-connection scheme of wind farm. On this basis the impact of energy storage device added to the wind farm side on power grid risk is analyzed. By means of analyzing risk level of power grid, a reasonable capacity configuration scheme for wind farm and energy storage system can be determined. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by IEEE-RTS.

84900484799	User comfort constraint demand response for residential thermostatically-controlled loads and efficient power plant modeling	Efficiency power plant (EPP) is an innovation of demand side management, which can improve the energy consumption efficiency and reduce the power consumption simultaneously, and can achieve the same effects as the construction of conventional power plants and power grids. In this paper, a novel EPP modeling method was proposed based on the home thermostatically-controlled loads (such as electric heat pumps). The heat pump load switching status was controlled using the state-queuing response control model, and the proposed user comfort constraints can reflect the frequency and life of use for the electric heat pumps. An efficiency power generator (EPG) model was constructed for a single area, considering the user comfortable constraints as the output boundary. Further, the optimal allocation model with multiple efficiency power generators was established, describing the effects of integrated EPP. In premise of reliable operation of communication systems in bi-directions, the monitoring and warning effects can be demonstrated for the efficiency output boundary on the response control of EPG. Through the simulation analysis of multiple EPGs acting as AGC units, the rationality of the optimal allocation model of EPPs and the load balancing effects of EPPs can be verified. A new technical approach was provided for demand response control in the area of distribution integration. © 2014 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.

84903536525	Boundary characteristic of section thermal security region in multi-dimension spaces	A method is proposed for calculating and analyzing the section thermal limit under the condition of the security “N-1” criterion with the security region in multi-dimensional space taken into account. By calculating each generator's power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) on section lines, the generators (groups) sensitive to the section thermal limit can be identified. With sensitive generators (groups) output as the axes of multi-dimensional space, the thermal limit points can be obtained under the condition of the security “N-1” criterion. Then the thermal stability security boundary can be formed when those thermal limit points are fitted in the multi-dimensional spaces. The thermal stability security boundary depicts the variation of section thermal limit with each sensitive factor output change and reflects the specific impact of sensitive factors on the section thermal limit. The further analysis shows that the thermal stability security boundary can be better fitted by one or more hyper planes, facilitating development of a fast algorithm for calculating the security region and discussing the application of security region in optimization control problems. The proposed method has been applied to the operation planning of a practical power grid in South China.

84903816230	A novel LMI criterion for power system stability with multiple time-delays	This paper presents a novel LMI criterion for electric power system stability with multiple time-delays. Initially, the linear time-invariant model of the power system with multiple delays is constructed, subsequently, the former criteria and the novel criterion of this paper are demonstrated in this paper, and the novel criterion is fully proved according to Lyapunov direct method. Specifically, the proposed criterion utilizes a properly simplified Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, and no free-weighting matrix is introduced in the formation of new criterion, as a consequence, the calculation efficiency is remarkably enhanced. A typical second-order delay system, a single-generator- infinite-bus system and the WSCC 3-generator-9-bus delay system are taken to validate the effectiveness and efficiency enhancement of the proposed criterion. The numerical results indicate that the criterion of this paper can generate the same stability margin with the former ones. Further, the numerical results also verify that the proposed criterion's efficiency is substantially boosted and calculation time is greatly curtailed. © 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84903839569	A multi-level service restoration strategy of distribution network considering microgrids and electric vehicles	The increasingly serious energy crisis and environmental pollution problems promote the large-scale application of microgrids (MGs) and electric vehicles (EVs). As the main carrier of MGs and EVs, distribution network is gradually presenting multi-source and active characteristics. A multi-level service restoration strategy of distribution network with MGs and EVs is proposed in this paper, which makes full use of the power supply capability from MGs and EVs. An optimal power flow (OPF) model is constructed to minimize the network loss after the service restoration. The proposed service restoration method is verified by applying a single fault on a modified IEEE distribution system with three-feeder and eighteen nodes containing MGs and EVs, which shows its feasibility and effectiveness. © 2014 IEEE.

84919783208	Flexibility assessment method for transmission expansion planning	An interval normalized risk index was proposed to assess and analyze the effect of transmission facilities failures on the flexibility of transmission expansion plans. This novel flexibility index took into account unavailability of transmission facilities such as overhead lines and transformers. At the beginning, normalized risk indices relating to overload and voltage violation were defined to assess the flexibility of plans. Then they were applied to the detection defects and weak points and the improvement of existing plans. The proposed method can validly measure the potential effects of faulty facilities on line loading and bus voltage, which helps planners to locate defects of the planning transmission network and propose improved projects. The case study based on IEEE 118 bus system demonstrates the validity and the case study based on Polish power network proves the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

10644281398	Study on models and methods for identifying of voltage stability limit more precisely	With the increasing concerns for more precise description of voltage stability limit in modern power systems, we investigated some models and methods required in this work. First, bifurcation method and so-called two-step method were both applied to a two-bus system, bringing up the first special characteristic of induction motor model: A SNB induced by stalling of motors always occurs well before Fold bifurcation point and SNB does not coincide with Fold in general sense. We proved this conclusion using analytic forms of the simple system. Then, the relationships between Continuation Power Flow (CPF), bifurcation and two-step method were revealed. Further application of these methods on a 9-bus system showed the second special characteristics of induction motor model: It is not all SNB with motors would lead to voltage instability and the system behavior at these SNBs will also depend on operating condition. The property of SNB could be verified either by bifurcation diagram or via time domain simulation with two-step method. Finally, a test on 1000-bus system confirms the complexity brought out by induction motor model and effectiveness of two-step method in computing voltage stability limit in a higher degree of precision.

84925248966	An efficient power plant model of electric vehicles considering the travel behaviors of EV users	Under the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) concept, an efficient power plant model of the E V aggregation (E-EPP) considering the travel behaviors of EV users is developed to determine the system V2G capability along a whole day. Firstly, based on the market survey data of various EV batteries, a nonlinear generic battery model (GBM) is established, which can describe the charging/discharging characteristics and the variation of state-of-charge (SOC) of EV batteries. Then, considering different traveling behaviors of EV users and combined with the proposed GBM, a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method is implemented to build the E-EPP model. Finally, three charging strategies (dumb charging, smart charging and hybrid charging) are considered to evaluate and compare the V2G capability boundary of the E-EPP by using a typical test example. Simulation results show that the developed E-EPP can determine the V2G capability of EVs along a typical day in order to keep the traveling comfort levels of EV users.
