19944428023	Differential regulation of Estrogen Receptor (ER)α and ERβ in primate mammary gland	Estrogen, mainly estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P) are essential for the growth and differentiation of the breast, but their roles in breast cancer are highly debated. To understand how E2 and P influence cell proliferation and differentiation, it is essential to know how their receptors are regulated. Because of limited tissue availability, little is known about regulation of the two estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) and the two progesterone receptor isoforms (PR-A and PR-B) in the normal human breast. What we know comes from rodent studies, which are not always pertinent for the human breast. We report now on regulation of gonadal hormone receptors during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and lactation in rhesus monkey mammary gland and on the relationship of these receptors to proliferation. We found that ERα but not ERβ is down-regulated when E2 levels increase and when cells enter the cell cycle. PR-B but not PR-A is expressed in proliferating cells. Thus under normal conditions, the ratio of ERα to ERβ in the breast depends on plasma concentrations of E2. Elevated expression of ERα (as occurs in postmenopausal women) is a normal response to loss of E2 and indicates non-proliferating cells. As selective receptor ligands become available, they will be helpful in delineation of the functions of these receptors.

84866600119	Indication of peritonectomy for peritoneal dissemination	A total of 521 patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) were treated by peritonectomy and perioperative chemotherapy. Each of the 95, 58, 316, 31,10 and 11 patients were from gastric, colorectal, appendiceal, ovarian, small bowel cancer and mesothelioma, respectively. The distribution and volume of PC are recorded by the Sugarbaker peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI). Peritonectomy was performed with a radical resection of the primary tumor and all gross PC with involved organs, peritoneum, or tissue that was deemed technically feasible and safe for the patient. The postoperative major complication of grade 3 was found in 14%, and total 30-day mortality was 2.7%. The survival of gastric cancer patients with a PCI score ≤ 6 was significantly better than those with a PCI score ≤ 7. In appendiceal neoplasm, patients with PCI score less than 28 showed significantly better survival than those with PCI score greater than 29. The survival of colorectal cancer patients with a PCI score ≥ 11 was significantly poorer than those with a PCI score ≤ 10. Among the various prognostic factors in appendiceal neoplasm and gastric cancer patients, CC-0 complete cytoreduction was the most important independent prognostic factor.Peritonectomy is done to remove macroscopic disease and perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy to eradicate microscopic residual disease aiming to remove disease completely with a single procedure. Peritonectomy combined with perioperative chemotherapy may achieve long-term survival in a selected group of patients with PC. The higher mortality rate underlines this necessarily strict selection that should be reserved to experienced institutions.

62949089686	Effects of pH on antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of tea saponins	In order to study the effects of environmental conditions, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of tea saponins (TS) in different pH values were evaluated. The antioxidant activity was examined by reducing power, superoxidant radical scavenging activity, metal chelating activity and so on. Antimicrobial activity was investigated using gram-negative, gram-positive bacterial and fungi. In vitro antioxidant activities exhibited pH dependency, and increased with increasing concentration of the extract. When pH was 8.0, TSs showed the best antioxidant activities, while the reversal result was found in antimicrobial measurement. At pH 8.0 and concentration 2.0 mg/mL, TSs scavenged 90.5% of superoxide radical. At pH 4.8, the minimum inhibitory concentration of TS was lower than 0.00625 % (w/v). The results indicate that TS can be an ideal antioxidant, and its antioxidant and antimicrobial activity depend on pH values. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

65349086145	Comparison of R-metalaxyl and rac-Metalaxyl in acute, chronic, and sublethal effect on aquatic organisms: Daphnia magna, scenedesmus quadricanda, and Danio rerio	Chiral pesticides are used widely in the world, and at present, older racemic products are being replaced by enantiopure products because of accelerated development of asymmetry synthesis techniques. Pesticides as xenobiotic released into environment impose a great stress on nontarget organisms. Although it is a necessary procedure for pesticides to have a registration based on toxicological data from nontarget organism, until now ecological risk assessment about metalaxyl only depend on racemic products. Hence, we investigated the acute, chronic, and sublethal toxicity of R-metalaxy and racmetalaxyl on aquatic organisms such as D. magna (Daphnia magna), algae (Scenedesmus quadricanda), and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). The results showed a significant difference in toxicity between R-metal- axyl and rac-metalaxyl. R-Metalaxy was about 20-fold more toxic to algae than rac-metalaxyl with IC

68149106097	Pathologic alterations in lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis induced by endotoxin and bleomycin	Objective: To study the pathologic changes in lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis induced by endotoxin and bleomycin. Methods: Sixty rats were separated into three groups at random as endotoxin group, bleomycin group, and control group according to the intratracheal or via caudal vein injection of endotoxin, bleomycin, and normal saline respectively. Five rats from every group were sacrificed on the 3rd, 7th, 14th, and 28th day to observe the pathologic changes in lung tissue by using transmission electronic microscope. Results: In endotoxin group, the degree of alveolitis was severe. Alveolar epithelium cells type II (AT II s) showed edema in the mitochondrion and degranulation of osmiophilic lamellar body, but hyperplasia was not obvious. In bleomycin group alveolitis was observed that happened slowly and developed into progressive pulmonary fibrosis, and AT II s were necrotic gradually. Deposition of collagen fibres around the mesynchemal cells were also present. Conclusion: Both endotoxin and bleomycin could cause pulmonary injury, and the former could recover, but the later would develop into progressive pulmonary fibrosis. This may be related to the degree of AT II injury.

70350231905	Novel water-soluble chitosan derivatives/quantum dots nanocomposite: Synthesis, characterization and photoluminescence properties	Water-soluble biocompatible and monodisperse ZnS, CdS, CdSe quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized using natural chitosan derivatives as stabilizers. TEM, XRD, SAED and UV-vis confirmed the formation of nanoparticles with average size of 3-5 nm, and the resulted ZnS, CdS nanocrystals were shown to be of cubic and blended phase. It was found that the molecular structure of chitosan stabilizer had a large influence on the optical and crystalline properties of the QDs. Through refluxing, the surface defects of the nanoparticles were passivated and the photoluminescence were enhanced. The particle size and the photoluminescence intensity can be controlled through altering the concentration of precursor ions and stabilizer solution, the molar ratio of metal ions/[S

70450198618	A thermosensitive chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel containing hydroxyapatite for protein delivery	The synthesis and characterization of a thermosensitive chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel containing hydroxyapatite for protein delivery were first reported. Two synthetic processes were introduced, that is, in situ and ex situ routes. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and rheological analysis were employed to characterize the hydrogel. The gel formation decreased the crystallinity of the hydroxyapatite crystal. FTIR results showed that the hydroxyapatite crystals were partially substituted by carbonate. It was supposed that the structural features of hydroxyapatite were close to those of biological apatites. The thermosensitive property of the gels was evaluated by rheological analysis, which indicated that the strength of hydroxyapatite- chitosan/PVA composite gels was notably enhanced in comparison with that of pure chitosan/PVA gel, especially for hydroxyapatite-chitosan/PVA composite gels synthesized through the in situ process. The performances of composite gels containing different amounts of hydroxyapatite were further studied. For the hydroxyapatite-chitosan/PVA composite gels containing 0.1 mM hydroxyapatite synthesized through in situ process, the swelling degree was the lowest, and the speed of protein release was the slowest. Therefore, the composite gels are attractive for applications as protein delivery, artificial bones, and scaffolds for tissue engineering. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

72149108718	Effect of hepatocyte growth factor on transforming growth factor-beta1 triggered epithelial-myofibroblast transdifferentiation of alveolar II cells in vitro	Objective: To observe the effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) on transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) triggered alveolar II cell transdifferentiation. Methods: Cultured cells from pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line A549 were assigned into the following groups: control group, HGF group, TGF-β1 group, and HGF+ TGF-β1 group. The morphology of transdifferentiated alveolar II cells was observed using phase-contrast microscope and scanning electron microscope. SP-A and αSMA were assessed by immunocytochemistry. Results: (1)The morphology of cells in TGF-β1 group was altered from the appearances of cellula epithelialis to the appearances of myofibroblast. (2)The expression of αSMA was increased but the expression of SP-A was decreased in TGF-β1 group, compared with that in control group respectively. (3)There was no statistically significant difference between HGF group and control group in the morphology of cells and the result of SP-A and α-SMA immunostaining. (4)The morphology of most cells in HGF+ TGF-β1 group still remained the appearances of cellula epithelialis, and the expression of α-SMA was decreased but the expression of SP-A was increased compared with that in TGF-β1 group respectively. Conclusion: HGF could block the alveolar II cell transdifferentiation induced by TGF-β1, which implies that HGF might participate in the lung fibrosis as a negative regulator.

75849157334	A novel pH-sensitive and freeze-thawed carboxymethyl chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) blended hydrogel for protein delivery	Background: Blended hydrogels are widely applied in medical fields. They can provide many advantages, such as biocompatibility and biodegradability. Many materials and methods are used to obtain blended hydrogels. In this work, carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) blended hydrogelswere prepared using the freezing and thawing technique. The properties of the hydrogels prepared, i.e. gel fraction, swelling and pH-responsive behaviors,were investigated. Results: The gel fraction increased with increasing time of freezing and thawing as determined through gravimetric analysis. It was also found that the equilibrium degree of swelling improved obviously due to the addition of CMCS compared to pure PVA hydrogel. The blended hydrogel with composition CMCS/PVA 80/20 (by weight) possessed the highest swelling ratio. The results of the influence of pH values on the swelling behavior showed that minimum swelling ratios of the hydrogels occurred near the isoelectric point of CMCS. Protein release studies were performed under various pH conditions: the release was much slower under acid than under basic conditions. The release showed a burst in the first 15 h and then steadily increased. Conclusion: The addition of CMCS can improve the physical properties of pure PVA hydrogels and provide pH sensitivity. It is concluded that PVA hydrogels containing CMCS could be potentially applied as oral delivery systems for protein drugs. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

77149123308	The rheological behaviour and drug-delivery property of chitosan/rectorite nanocomposites	The rheological behaviour of the nanocomposites based on chitosan (CS) and unmodified rectorite (REC) were first evaluated. The nanocomposites showed a low shear-rate non-Newtonian viscosity and a rapid shear-thinning behaviour. The zero shear rate viscosity and the storage and loss moduli for the nanocomposites displayed a monotonic increase with increasing REC content in comparison with pure CS. The results implied the presence of electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interaction between CS and REC, which was corroborated by the SEM images and FT-IR analysis. Then CS beads and CS/REC nanocomposite beads were prepared via the cross-linking interaction of sodium tripolyphosphate and CS, SEM images indicated that the nanocomposite beads had more compact surface and internal structure than those of CS beads. The swelling degree of the nanocomposite beads in 0.9% (w/v) saline was only about 15%, while that of CS beads was 30%. The nanocomposite beads released the drug continuously; in the given 6 days the minimum cumulative release only reached 51.4%, much lower than that of pure CS beads (72.1%). Therefore, CS/REC nanocomposites are more suitable to apply as drug carrier than pure CS. © 2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

77149176921	The preparation and cytocompatibility of injectable thermosensitive chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel	In order to investigate the strength, structure and cell cytocompatibility of injectable thermosensitive chitosan (CS)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composite hydrogel, chitosan hydrochloride solution was transferred to a neutral pH and mixed with different proportions of PVA, then the gelation time and strength of these different hydrogels were tested and spatial structures were observed under a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after freeze-drying. The cytocompatibility of the hydrogels was evaluated through cytotoxicity test and three-dimensional culture with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. The results showed that the CS/PVA solution kept in liquid state at low temperature (0-4°C) and turned into transparent elastomer about 15-20 min at 37°C. Gelation time was prolonged, the strength increased and porous structure became dense with the PVA content increased in the mixed hydrogel. The cytotoxicity grades of these gels were from 0 to 1. Rabbit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells could survive and proliferate in the gel within 3 weeks, and the gel had good cytocompatibility. It was concluded that thermosensitive CS/PVA composite hydrogel not only has interpenetrating network structure and better mechanical strength, but also has good cytocompatibility, and may be used as an injectable scaffold for tissue engineering. © 2010 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

77950531388	Establishment and identification of a rabbit model of peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer	Background: Gastric cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis is a common clinical problem, but there are no suitable large animal models to study this problem. This study was to establish a stable rabbit peritoneal carcinomatosis model of gastric cancer using VX2 tumor, and analyze the clinico-pathological features.Methods: VX2 tumor was implanted into 36 New Zealand rabbits by 3 methods: laparotomic orthotopic injection of cancer cells into the submucosal layer of the stomach (Group A), laparotomic implantation of tumor tissue into the greater omentum immediately beneath the gastric antrum (Group B), and percutaneous injection of tumor cells directly into the peritoneal cavity (Group C), 12 rabbits in each group. The animals were closely observed and detailed clinico-pathological studies were conducted.Results: The success rates of peritoneal carcinomatosis formation were 100% (12/12), 91.7% (11/12) and 58.3% (7/12), respectively, for Groups A, B and C (P = 0.019, A versus C; P = 0.077, B versus C; P = 0.500, A versus B, Fisher's exact test). Two weeks after submucosal cancer cells injection in Group A, ulcerative gastric cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis showed typical VX2 tumor pathology, with widespread intraperitoneal metastatic nodules, bloody ascites and perspicuous pulmonary metastases. The clinico-pathological progression pattern was very similar to patients of advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Groups B and C showed similar pattern of cancer progression, but less aggressive.Conclusions: First large animal model of peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer has been established by laparotomic orthotopic injection of VX2 cancer cells into the submucosal layer of the stomach, providing a more suitable model for surgical interventional studies. The clinico-pathological features of this model resemble human peritoneal carcinomatosis. © 2010 Mei et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77951498288	A thermosensitive chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel containing nanoparticles for drug delivery	The synthesis and characterization of a thermosensitive chitosan (CS)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel containing nanoparticles with different charges for drug delivery were reported. Through the electrostatic effect of-N?(CH3)3 and -COO-, the nanoparticles of N-(2-hydroxyl) propyl-3-trimethyl ammonium chitosan chloride(HTCC)-carboxymethyl chitosan (CM) were prepared. The nanoparticles with different charges were obtained by the different ratio of -N(CH3)3 and -COO-, which were suitable for drug delivery with opposite charges, such as propranolol and diclofenac sodium, respectively. The release of the positive drug was the slowest with the hydrogels containing negative nanoparticles. Similarly, the release of the negative drug was the slowest with the hydrogels containing positive nanoparticles. However, the releases of the two drugs were both the fastest with the pure hydrogels. It indicated the addition of nanoparticles was helpful to slow the suitable drug release. Though the nanoparticles did not reinforce the gel strength, the electrostatic effect between nanoparticles and drugs reduced the burst release. Therefore, the composite gels are attractive for applications as carriers for drug delivery. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

The samples were extracted with ethyl acetate and cyclohexane (1: 1 > v/v), and cleaned-up by gel permeation chromatography (GPC/. The GPC eluant collected from 26 min to 44 min was concentrated to 1 mLi then analyzed using GC-MS. A DB-1701 column was used for the separation. The MS detection was performed in selected ion monitoring mode. The recoveries were determined at the two spiked levels of 1 LOQ and 4 LOQ (LOQ: limit of quantification). The overall recoveries were from 50. 2% to 120% > and in which the recoveries of 89. 5% pesticides were from 70% to 120%. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the recoveries were from 0. 6% to 21. 6%. The calibration curves of all pesticides showed good linearities in the respective ranges with the correlation coefficient above 0. 97. The limits of detection and the limits of quantification were 0. 002 -0. 3 mg/kg and 0. 007 -1.2 mg/kg> respectively. The sensitivity and accuracy of the method met the requirements of the multiple pesticide residues. This method was applicable to determine 191 multiple pesticide residues in fugu, eel, prawn and other fishes.

The pesticide residues were extracted from the samples by acetonitrile containing 1% acetate acid, cleaned-up by a Waters Sep-Pak Vac cartridge, eluted with 25 mL acetonitrile-toluene (3:1, v/v) and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The sample was redissolved in the acetonitrile-water (3:2, v/v), then analyzed using LC-MS/MS in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode via positive elec-trospray ionization with an Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 column as the analytical column. The method was validated at two fortification levels in five fruit and vegetable juices, orange, apple, grape, cabbage and carrot juices. The validation results were as follows: The overall recoveries were from 57. 2% to 122. 7% with the relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 0. 9% -19. 8%; and the limits of detection (S/N = 3) and the limits of quantification (S/N = 10) were 0. 10 -56. 77 μg/kg and 0. 33 - 189. 23 μg/kg, respectively. The results demonstrated that this method is simple, rapid and characterized with acceptable sensitivity and accuracy to meet the requirements of the multiple pesticide residue analysis. This method is applicable to confirm 156 pesticide residues in the above five juices.

77957900007	Co-evolution of cancer microenvironment reveals distinctive patterns of gastric cancer invasion: Laboratory evidence and clinical significance	Background: Cancer invasion results from constant interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment. Major components of the cancer microenvironment are stromal cells, infiltrating inflammatory cells, collagens, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and newly formed blood vessels. This study was to determine the roles of MMP-9, MMP-2, type IV collagen, infiltrating macrophages and tumor microvessels in gastric cancer (GC) invasion and their clinico-pathological significance.Methods: Paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 37 GC patients were studied by Streptavidin-Peroxidase (SP) immunohistochemical technique to determine the levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, type IV collagen, macrophages infiltration and microvessel density (MVD). Different invasion patterns were delineated and their correlation with major clinico-pathological information was explored.Results: MMP2 expression was higher in malignant gland compared to normal gland, especially nearby the basement membrane (BM). High densities of macrophages at the interface of cancer nests and stroma were found where BM integrity was destroyed. MMP2 expression was significantly increased in cases with recurrence and distant metastasis (P = 0.047 and 0.048, respectively). Infiltrating macrophages were correlated with serosa invasion (P = 0.011) and TNM stage (P = 0.001). MVD was higher in type IV collagen negative group compared to type IV collagen positive group (P = 0.026). MVD was related to infiltrating macrophages density (P = 0.040). Patients with negative MMP9 expression had better overall survival (OS) compared to those with positive MMP9 expression (Median OS 44.0 vs 13.5 mo, P = 0.036). Median OS was significantly longer in type IV collagen positive group than negative group (Median OS 25.5 vs 10.0 mo, P = 0.044). The cumulative OS rate was higher in low macrophages density group than in high macrophages density group (median OS 40.5 vs 13.0 mo, P = 0.056). Median OS was significantly longer in low MVD group than high MVD group (median OS 39.0 vs 8.5 mo, P = 0.001). The difference of disease-free survival (DFS) between low MVD group and high MVD group was not statistically significant (P = 0.260). Four typical patterns of cancer invasion were identified based on histological study of the cancer tissue, including Washing pattern, Ameba-like pattern, Spindle pattern and Linear pattern.Conclusions: Proteolytic enzymes MMP9, MMP2 and macrophages in stroma contribute to GC progression by facilitating the angiogenesis. Cancer invasion patterns may help predict GC metastasis. © 2010 Peng et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Methods; CRS and HIPEC procedures were performed in 28 GC patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis and/or malignant ascites, with survival and perioperative safety as study endpoints. Results; A total of 30 CRS and HIPEC procedures were performed. Cytoreduction scores ratings were CCR-O in 11 (39. 2%), CCR-1 in 6 (21.4%), CCR-2 in 8 (28.8%), and CCR-3 in 3 (10.6%) cases. 19 patients (67.9%) were dead and 9 patients (32.1%) survived, and the 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month survival rates were 75%, 50% , 43%, and 43%, respectively. The median survivals of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) ≤20 and PCI>20 were 27.7 months (95% CI=15.2-40.3 months) and 6.4 months (95% CI = 3.8-8.9 months) (P = 0.000) respectively. The estimated median survival for patients with CCR-0, CCR-1 and CCR-2&3 were 43.4 months (95% CI = 26.9-59.9 months), 9.5 months (95% CI = 6.4-12.6 months), and 7.5 months (95% CI = 3.0-13.6 months) respectively (F = 0.001, CCR0 vs CCR1-3). The median survivals of patients with synchronous and metachronous peritoneal carcinomatosis were 24 months (95% CI= 21.6-48.4 months) and 12 months (95%CI=6.6-19.4 months) respectively (P = 0.000). No perioperative death but 4 (14.3%) serious adverse events occurred. Conclusion; CRS plus HIPEC could offer survival advantage for selected GC patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis and ascites, with acceptable safety profile.

78649751237	Establishment and CT manifestations of rabbit peritoneal carcinomatosis VX2 tumor model	Objective: To establish a stable transplanted model of peritoneal carcinomatosis in rabbit using VX2 tumor, and to analyze the CT manifestations of the inoculation tumor and the feature of metastasis. Methods: VX2 tumor was implanted in 36 New Zealand rabbits by three methods; laparotomie implantation, laparotomie puncture and percutaneous puncture ( 12 animals per group). Of each group, six rabbits were subjected to cancer tissue inoculation and another six to cancer cell suspension inoculation. The growth and local or distance metastases of tumors were observed under microscope or by CT scanning. Results: The success rate of peritoneal carcinomatosis model were 100% (12/12), 91. 7% (11/12) and 58. 3% (7/12) , respectively, with a significant difference between laparotomie puncture and percutaneous puncture (P<C0.05). Ulcerative gastric cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis showed typical VX2 tumor pathological changes, with widespread intraperitoneal metastatic nodules, hemorrhagic ascites, and obvious pulmonary metastases after four weeks. CT examinations also revealed characteristic peritoneal carcinomatosis and pulmonary metastases. This clinicopathological progression pattern was very similar to human advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Conclusion; The VX2 tumor tissue implantation to make models of peritoneal carcinomatosis is convenient, feasible, and time saving, and provides a more suitable model for surgical or interventional studies. CT is accurate for monitoring the growth and blood supplying of tumor. The clinicopathological features of this tumor model resemble those of human peritoneal carcinomatosis closely.

78649875044	Pendant orientation and its influence on the formation of hydrogen-bonded thiacalixarene nanotubes	Five 1,3-alternate thiacalix[4]arene derivatives bearing carboxylic acid and/or urea hydrogen-bonding groups were prepared and their crystal structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods. In compound 1, where the pendant arms are all adorned with carboxylic acid groups, the pendants all orientate along the base of the molecular axis. An interesting three-dimensional network of "endo-inclusion" aquatubes is formed by stacking the water contained cavities of 1 up and down. While concerning to the other four compounds to which the urea groups are introduced, their pendant arms either orientate towards the inner side of the cavities, or orientate towards the outside, depending on the types of hydrogen-bonding groups and the position of these groups. When the urea groups are in the same side (compounds 2, 4 and 5), the opposite chains in the molecule will locate away from each other which may be due to the steric repulsions. But when the urea group and carboxylic acid group are in the same side (compounds 3 and 4), the opposite chains all orientate inwards because of the intramolecular, inter-chain hydrogen bonds between the opposite chains. Although these four compounds can also self-assemble through the cavity stacking motif, the inwardly orientated pendant arms which protrude into the thiacalixarene cavity obstruct the channels. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

78650292224	Rheological behaviour of chitin in NaOH/urea aqueous solution	The rheological behaviour of chitin in 8 wt% NaOH/4 wt% urea aqueous medium was evaluated by steady shear and dynamic oscillatory tests, in which the effects of concentration, temperature and time on the rheological behaviour of chitin aqueous solution were investigated in detail. It suggested that chitin aqueous solution is sensitive to temperature, which will transform to a gel when temperature increases to physiological conditions. And the higher the concentration is, the lower the gelation temperature is. The comparison on rheological behaviour of chitin aqueous solution at different time reveals that 8 wt% NaOH/4 wt% urea solvent at low temperature has little effect on chitin structure. It is interesting that the chitin gel has reversibility and it will transit to solution after being treated at low temperature again. The comparison on rheological behaviour between the original chitin aqueous solution and the chitin aqueous solution after gelation reveals that gelation has a little effects on solution properties. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79952064960	Surgical treatment for peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer	This review describes the latest surgical treatments for peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) arising from gastric cancer. Systemic chemotherapy is less effective against PC because of the existence of the blood-peritoneal barrier. Accordingly, perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy plus cytoreductive surgery (CRS) is a new trend of multidisciplinary therapy for PC. Intraperitoneally administered drugs penetrate directly into the peritoneal dissemination, resulting in the high loco-regional intensity of drugs. A new bidirectional chemotherapy called neoadjuvant intraperitoneal/systemic chemotherapy (NIPS) has been developed. After NIPS, the disappearance of PFCCs has been reported, and the incidence of complete cytoreduction has increased accordingly. Complete cytoreduction, a low peritoneal carcinomatosis index, and negative PFCCs are significant favorable prognostic factors. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) after CRS is associated with improved survival with an acceptable postoperative mortality and morbidity.

79954481371	Influence of infiltrating macrophages on progression and prognosis of gastric cancer	Objective: To determine the level of infiltrating macrophages in gastric cancer (GC) and to analyze the relationship between macrophage infiltration and clinicopathologic features and prognosis. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was adopted to detect the level of infiltrating macrophages in 37 specimens of GC collected from our hospital. The number of infiltrating macrophages at the tumor-stroma interface was directly counted under the microscope. The relationship between the level of infiltrating macrophages and clinicopathologic features was analyzed. Moreover, we focused on the value of infiltrating macrophages in survival status of GC patients. Results: The interface of tumor nest and stroma was the main location of infiltrating macrophages in GC, as well as the areas rich in vascular formation. The area of basement membrane destruction was the hot region of infiltrating macrophages. The mean macrophage counts under high power field for 37 GC patients and 29 cases without distant metastasis were 19.7±8.9 and 18.9±8.3, respectively. Infiltrating macrophages were not associated with age, pathological types, recurrence, or lymph node status (P>0.05). Macrophage infiltration levels were 21.6±8.0 in cases with serosa-invasion and 12.7±9.2 in those without serosa-invasion (P=0.011). Macrophage infiltration level was significantly higher in advanced GC (22.6±8.1) than in early GC (12.8±7.1) (P=0.001). The median survival for all 37 GC patients was 19.0 months and was correlated with serosa invasion, distant metastasis and TNM stage (P values were 0.024, 0.021 and 0.009, respectively). The median disease-free survival was 13.0 months and was correlated with serosa invasion (P=0.038) and TNM stage (P=0.006). The cumulative overall survival was higher in the low macrophage density group (40.5 months) than in the high macrophage density group (13.0 months), with no significant difference (P=0.056). The cumulative disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly higher in the low macrophage density group (37.0 months) than in the high macrophage density group (9.5 months) (P=0.041). Conclusion: Macrophage infiltration plays a significant role in GC progression and can be used for the evaluation of prognosis. More infiltrating macrophages in tumor specimens may indicate faster tumor progression and shorter disease-free survival.

79958209681	Quantum dots-based double-color imaging of HER2 positive breast cancer invasion	It has been well recognized that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) level in breast cancer (BC) is closely related to the malignant biologic behaviors of the tumor, including invasion and metastasis. Yet, there has been a lack of directly observable evidence to support such notion. Here we report a quantum dots (QDs)-based double-color imaging technique to simultaneously show the HER2 level on BC cells and the type IV collagen in the tumor matrix. In benign breast tumor, the type IV collagen was intact. With the increasing of HER2 expression level, there has been a progressive decrease in type IV collagen around the cancer nest. At HER2 (3+) expression level, there has virtually been a total destruction of type IV collagen. Moreover, HER2 (3+) BC cells also show direct invasion into the blood vessels. This novel imaging method provides direct observable evidence to support the theory that the HER2 expression level is directly related to BC invasion. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

80054797909	High-throughput GC/MS and HPLC/MS/MS techniques for the multiclass, multiresidue determination of 653 pesticidesand chemical pollutants in tea	An efficient and sensitive method has been established for simultaneous determination of 653 pesticides in teas by GC/MS and HPLC/MS/MS. The method involved extraction with acetonitrile followed by cleanup using Cleanert-TPT SPE and subsequent identification and quantitation of 490 pesticides by GC/MS and 448 pesticides by HPLC/MS/ MS. The LODs for pesticides determined by GC/MS were between 1.0 and 500 μg/kg, and those determined by HPLC/MS/MS were between 0.03 and 4820 μg/kg. At the low fortification levels of 0.01-100 μg/kg, the average recoveries of 94% of the pesticides determined by GC/MS were between 60 and 120%, 77% of which had an RSD below 20%. For 91% of pesticides determined by HPLC/MS/MS, the average recoveries were between 60 and 120%, 76% of which had an RSD below 20%. The paper also reports a novel SPE column, Cleanert TPT, which comprised graphitized carbon black (PestiCarb), polyamine silica, and amide polystyrene for purifying the tea samples. The results indicated good repeatiblity and reproducibility. © 2012 Publishing Technology.

84455204796	Analysis and research of direction relation based on fuzzy description	A fuzzy membership function was defined for each direction to predict the membership degree that an object pertains to a certain direction. Nine fuzzy membership functions were defined to describe the direction relations between fuzzy objects and crisp objects with corresponding fuzzy sets. Direction relations were described by a 3×3 fuzzy matrix, which was computed by an aggregation operator defined on the nine fuzzy sets. The fuzzy matrices and crisp matrices of direction relations between fuzzy objects and crisp objects were computed respectively, and comparison of fuzzy matrices with crisp ones reveals that the proposed fuzzy approach is more effective than existing crisp method.

84655170242	Hepatocellular carcinoma: Insight from animal models	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the third most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. Although major risk factors for the development of HCC have been defined, many aspects of the evolution of hepatocellular carcinogenesis and metastasis are still unknown. Suitable animal models are, therefore, essential to promote our understanding of the molecular, cellular and pathophysiological mechanisms of HCC and for the development of new therapeutic strategies. This Review provides an overview of animal models that are relevant to HCC development, metastasis and treatment. For HCC development, this Review focuses on transgenic mouse models of HBV and HCV infection, which provide experimental evidence that viral genes could initiate or promote liver carcinogenesis. Animal models of HCC metastasis provide platforms to elucidate the mechanisms of HCC metastasis, to study the interaction between the microenvironment and HCC invasion and to conduct intervention studies. In addition, animal models have been developed to investigate the effects of new treatment modalities. The criteria for establishing ideal HCC animal models are also discussed. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

84859723432	Effect on ultrafiltration of lactic acid fermentation broth by using inclined tubes sedimentation as pretreatment	This study combined inclined tube sedimentation with ultrafiltration to remove the particles and protein in lactic acid fermentation broth. The influence of flow velocity on the extract property was investigated as well as the variations of flux, protein removal rate and lactic acid recovery in ultrafiltration. The result indicated that the inclined tube sedimentation was effective to remove the particles of fermentation broth. When the flow velocity was 0.031cm/s, the percentage of particles smaller than 10μm was 77%. The flow velocity 0.143cm/s in inclined tube sedimentation was more suitable in this study. SS removal rate can achieve 45.5% while protein removal rate and lactic acid recovery can be maintained above 90% in such situation. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84862275881	Surgical results of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis treated with cytoreductive surgery using a new technique named aqua dissection	During 2004 to 2011, 81, 420, and 166 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), epithelial appendiceal neoplasm (APN), and gastric cancer (GC) with PC were treated with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) plus perioperative chemotherapy. CRS was performed by peritonectomy techniques using an aqua dissection. Results. Complete cytoreduction was done in 62/81 (76.5), 228/420 (54.3), and 101/166 (60.8) of patients with CRC, APN, and GC. The main reasons of incomplete resections were involvement of all peritoneal regions and diffuse involvement of small bowel. The incidence (64, 302/470) of CC-0 resection after introduction of an aqua dissection was significantly higher than before (42, 82/197). A total of 41 (6.1) patients died postoperatively. Major complication (grade 3-4 complications) occurred in 126 patients (18.9). A reoperation was necessary in 36 patients (5.4). By the multivariate analysis, PCI scores capable of serving as thresholds for favorable versus poor prognosis in each group and CC scores demonstrated as the independent prognostic factors. Conclusions. Peritonectomy using an aqua dissection improves the incidence of complete cytoreduction, and improves the survival of patients with PC. Patients with PCI larger than the threshold values should be treated with chemotherapy to improve the incidences of complete cytoreduction. Copyright © 2012 Y. Yonemura et al.

84864521261	Multivariate survival and outcome analysis of 154 patients with gastric cancer at a single Chinese institution	This study was conducted to analyze and elucidate key prognostic factors for gastric cancer (GC), and to understand the current status of GC diagnosis and treatment in Hubei Province, China. Major clinical and pathological information on 154 GC patients was retrospectively collected, including gender, age, tumor site, surgical approach, histological type, TNM stage and chemotherapy cycles. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed in relation to these factors. The median OS was 12.0 months (0.5-69.0 months), and 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 53.0%, 23.0%, 8.0% and 1.0%, respectively. The median OS by TNM stage was 21.0 months for stages I+II and 11.5 months in stages III+IV (P=0.043), and 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 72.0% vs 50.0%, 40.0% vs 19.0%, 16.0% vs 6.0% and 0% vs 1.0 %, respectively. The median OS by chemotherapy cycles was 18.0 months in chemotherapy ≥6 cycles group and 11.0 months in chemotherapy <6 cycles group (P=0.009), and 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 68.0% vs 49.0%, 41.0% vs 18.0%, 12.0% vs 7.0% and 0% vs 1.0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified tumor site, surgical approach and chemotherapy cycles as independent predictors for improved survival. Implementation of standardized radical surgery and reasonable adjuvant therapy could improve survival and prognosis of GC patients.

84866031926	Secretory TAT-peptide-mediated protein transduction of LIF receptor α-chain distal cytoplasmic motifs into human myeloid HL-60 cells	The distal cytoplasmic motifs of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor α-chain (LIFRα-CT3) can independently induce intracellular myeloid differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells by gene transfection; however, there are significant limitations in the potential clinical use of these motifs due to liposome-derived genetic modifications. To produce a potentially therapeutic LIFRα-CT3 with cell-permeable activity, we constructed a eukaryotic expression pcDNA3.0-TAT-CT3-cMyc plasmid with a signal peptide (ss) inserted into the N-terminal that codes for an ss-TAT-CT3-cMyc fusion protein. The stable transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells via this vector and subsequent selection by Geneticin resulted in cell lines that express and secrete TAT-CT3-cMyc. The spent medium of pcDNA3.0-TAT-CT3-cMyc-transfected CHO cells could be purified using a cMycepitope-tag agarose affinity chromatography column and could be detected via SDS-PAGE, with antibodies against cMyc-tag. The direct administration of TAT-CT3-cMyc to HL-60 cell culture media caused the enrichment of CT3-cMyc in the cytoplasm and nucleus within 30 min and led to a significant reduction of viable cells (P < 0.05) 8 h after exposure. The advantages of using this mammalian expression system include the ease of generating TAT fusion proteins that are adequately transcripted and the potential for a sustained production of such proteins in vitro for future AML therapy.

84869483143	In vitro bioactivation of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (2 S,3 R)-(+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-2-[4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-ylethoxy)phenyl]-2,3-dihydro-1, 4-benzoxathiin-6-ol (I) in liver microsomes: Formation of adenine adducts	As part of our efforts to develop safer selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), compound I {(2S,3R)-(+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-2-[4-(2- pyrrolidin-1-ylethoxy)-phenyl]-2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzoxathiin-6-ol} was previously identified as a lead for further development. Subsequent studies showed that compound I is genotoxic in both in vitro Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in vivo mouse studies. To better understand the possible mechanisms for the observed genetoxicity effects, in vitro incubations of I with liver microsomes of human, monkey, and mouse in the presence of adenine were performed, which led to the detection of five adenine adducts. The formation of these adducts was NADPH-dependent, suggesting the involvement of oxidative bioactivation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The mechanism for the formation of the major adenine adduct (A1) involves the formation of a reactive ring-opened para-quinone intermediate. The formation of four other adenine adducts may involve the formation of a reactive epoxide or ortho-quinone intermediate. Furthermore, incubations of compound I with human hepatocytes showed dose-dependent DNA damages in Comet assays. All of the above suggest that some reactive metabolites of compound I, formed through bioactivation mechanisms, have a potential to interact with DNA molecules in vitro and in vivo. This may be one of the causes of the genotoxicity observed preclinically both in vitro and in vivo. This case study demonstrated an approach using in vitro DNA trapping assays for assessing the genotoxicity potential of drug candidates. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84868358047	Compensation for matrix effects in the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of 186 pesticides in tea matrices using analyte protectants	A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analytical method was developed for simultaneously determining 186 pesticides in tea matrices using analyte protectants to counteract the matrix-induced effect. The matrix effects were evaluated for green, oolong and black tea, representing unfermented, partially fermented and completely fermented teas respectively and depending on the type of tea, 72%, 94% and 94% of the pesticides presented strong response enhancement effect. Several analyte protectants as well as certain combinations of these protectants were evaluated to check their compensation effects. A mixture of triglycerol and d-ribonic acid-γ-lactone (both at 2. mg/mL in the injected samples) was found to be the most effective in improving the chromatographic behavior of the 186 pesticides. More than 96% of the 186 pesticides achieved recoveries within the range of 70-120% when using the selected mixture of analyte protectants. The simple addition of analyte protectants offers a more convenient solution to overcome matrix effects, results in less active sites compared to matrix-matched standardization and can be an effective approach to compensate for matrix effects in the GC-MS analysis of pesticide residues. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84872360683	Experimental study on the efficacy and safety of cytoreductive surgery plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy combined with molecular targeted therapeutic regimen Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-DOX (PDOX) for treating peritoneal carcinomatosis of gastric cancer	Objective: This work aimed to study the efficacy and safety of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) combined with targeting anti-tumor drug Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-DOX (PDOX) for treating the gastric cancer rabbit models with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). Methods: VX2 tumor cells were injected into the gastric sub-mucosa of 40 adult male New Zealand rabbits using a laparotomic inoculation technique and laparoscopy in order to construct the gastric cancer rabbit model with PC. The rabbits were randomly divided into 4 groups: the Control group (n=10) without any treatment, the HIPEC group (n=10) receiving CRS plus HIPEC (docetaxel 10.0mg and carboplatin 50.0 mg in 250 mL normal saline, at 42.5 ± 0.5°C for 30 min), the PDOX group (n= 10) receiving systemic chemotherapy with PDOX 50.0 mg/kg (10.0 mg/kg every 4 d for 5 cycles) after CRS+HIPEC, and the DOX group (n=10) receiving systemic chemotherapy with DOX 5.0 mg/kg (1.0 mg/kg every 4 d for 5 cycles) after CRS+HIPEC. The CRS+HIPEC regimen was performed for a total of 8 d, while the systemic chemotherapy was initiated 16 d after model construction. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoint was safety profile. Results: Rabbit PC model was successfully established in all animals (100%, 40/40). The median (95% confidence interval [CI]) survivals were 23.0 d (19.9 d to 26.1 d) in the Control group, 41.0 d (36.9 d to 45.1 d) in the HIPEC group, 58.0 d (39.6 d to 54.4 d) in the PDOX group, and 65.0 d (44.1 d to 71.9 d) in the DOX group. Compared with the Control group, the OS was extended by at least 70% in the HIPEC group (P<0.001). Compared with the HIPEC group, the OS was extended by at least 40% in the PDOX and DOX groups (P=0.029, PDOX vs. HIPEC; P=0.021, DOX vs. HIPEC). There were no differences in the blood cell count, liver and kidney functions, creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) between the 2 groups at the same time point. The values of white blood cell and platelet were significantly lower in the DOX than in the HIPEC group, after the systemic chemotherapy (P<0.05). Conclusion: The regimen of CRS plus HIPEC could bring survival benefits to the gastric cancer rabbit model with PC. Furthermore, the addition of molecular targeted therapy with PDOX could bring about better survival benefits with more satisfactory drug safety.

84872363370	Cytoreductive surgery plus hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy for peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer	Objective: This work aimed to study the efficacy and safety of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) plus hyperthermic in tra-peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) on peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from gastric cancer. Methods: A total of 106 gastric cancer patients with PC were randomized into the CRS group (n=45) and the CRS+HIPEC group (n=61). The former group received conventional radical surgery, and the latter group underwent maximal CRS and HIPEC therapy using hydroxycamptothecin 20 mg plus mitomycin 30 mg, or docetaxel 120 mg plus cisplatin 120 mg in 12,000 mL of normal saline at 43±0.51°C for 60 min to 90 min. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoint was severe adverse events (SAE). Results: The major clinico-pathological characteristics were well-balanced between the CRS and CRS+HIPEC groups. By the end of the follow-up (median, 30 mo), the gastric cancer PC-related death rates were 93.3% (42/45) in the CRS group and 77.0% (47/61) in CRS+HIPEC group (P<0.05). The median OS were 7.0 mo (95%CI 5.8 mo to 8.2 mo) in the CRS group, but 11.1 mo (95% CI 8.3 mo to 13.9 mo) in the CRS+HIPEC group (P=0.003). SAE occurred in 6 patients in the CRS group and 8 in the CRS+HIPEC group (P >0.05). Multivariate analysis showed 5 independent factors for achieving survival improvement, including CRS+HIPEC, gastric cancer with synchronous PC, complete cytoreduction, no SAE and systemic chemotherapy over 6 cycles. Conclusion: CRS+HIPEC could improve the survival of gastric cancer patients with synchronous PC without significant increase of SAE.

Methods: The orthotopic nude mice model of human GC was established with human GC cell line MGC-803. The animals were randomized into PDOX (n=12), DOX (n=12), and Control (n=11) groups, and were treated with PDOX (28.8 mg/Kg, i.p), DOX (DOX 4.0 mg/kg, i.p), and the control (10.0 ml/kg, i.p), respectively, on days 10, 17, and 24. Detailed records of the general status were made on all animals twice a week. The experiments were terminated when the nude mice of any group died of tumor progression, and all the remaining nude mice were euthanized. Peripheral blood was collected for hematology and biochemistry. At autopsy, detailed records were made on the weight and size of GC, ascites, abdominal lymph nodes metastasis, and tumor-host body weight ratio. Histo-pathological studies were performed to identify any suspected sites. All data were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: Compared with the Control group, both the PDOX and DOX groups showed significant reduction in tumor weight and volume (P<0.05), and both treatments resulted in weight reduction of gastric tumor by 26.4% and 24.9%, respectively. There were no statistical differences between the PDOX and DOX treatments (P>0.05). Based on peripheral blood routine, there was a significantly higher level of platelets in the PDOX than in the Control group and (P<0.05), while lymphocyte ratio was lower in the PDOX than in the Control group (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in red blood cells and hemoglobin levels among the three groups (P>0.05). There were also no significant differences in the liver and kidney functions among the three groups (P>0.05). Cardiac function showed that PDOX had a significantly higher level of CK-MB compared with the Control group (P<0.01), and both the DOX and PDOX groups had no significant differences in creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Immunohistochemistry showed that PDOX had a significantly lower level of Ki-67 compared with the DOX and Control groups (P<0.01). There were no statistically significant differences among Bcl-2, Bcl-6, Tunel, and VEGF of the groups (P>0.05). The values of CD34 and D2-40 decreased in the PDOX group compared with DOX and Control groups. Conclusion: Compared with DOX, PDOX may have a better overall efficacy in this GC model, particularly in terms of inhibiting distant metastases and reducing toxicities.

Methods: Fifty-four PC patients underwent MDCT and MPR before surgery. The results of the CT scan were analyzed by radiologists and oncologists by comparing the sensitivity and specificity with the intraoperative findings. Results: A total of 356 PC lesions were found in all 54 patients after enhanced CT scanning, ranging from 1 to 13 (average 6.5±3.4) for each patient. The most frequently observed PC sites were the greater omentum, left hemidiaphragm, splenic capsule, pelvis, right hemidiaphragm, and gastric ligaments. The PC lesions were mainly solid, with a diameter range of 0.5 cm to 13 cm. The overall sensitivity was 78.1% (356/456), and the overall specificity was 92.3% (277/300). The sensitivity was 90% (307/341) for the lesions ≥ 0.5 cm, was reduced to 42.6% (49/115) for the lesions <0.5 cm. The degree of fitness between the CT-peritoneal carcinomatosis index (CT-PCI) and the intraoperative PCI was 0.384 to 0.640 (P<0.05). Conclusion: MDCT and MPR can help determine a good degree of fitness of the CT-PCI value with the intraoperative findings and can significantly inform decision-making on treatment options for peritoneal carcinomatosis.

84873664097	Cathepsin B-cleavable doxorubicin prodrugs for targeted cancer therapy (Review)	Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the most effective cytotoxic anticancer drugs used for the treatment of hematological malignancies, as well as a broad range of solid tumors. However, the clinical applications of this drug have long been limited due to its severe dose-dependent toxicities. Therefore, DOX derivatives and analogs have been developed to address this issue. A type of DOX prodrug, cleaved by cathepsin B (Cat B), which is highly upregulated in malignant tumors and premalignant lesions, has been developed to achieve a higher DOX concentration in tumor tissue and a lower concentration in normal tissue, so as to enhance the efficacy and reduce toxicity to normal cells. In this review, we focused on Cat B-cleavable DOX prodrugs and discussed the efficacy of these prodrugs, demonstrated by preclinical and clinical developments.

84873457955	In vitro effect of recombinant human adenovirus p53 combined with epirubicin on human gastric cancer cells	Objective: To study the effect of recombinant human adenovirus p53 injection (rAd-p53) and Epirubicin Hydrochloride (EPI) on human gastric cancer cells in vitro, and explore the therapeutic effect of gene therapy combined with chemotherapy on gastric cancer. Methods: The MGC-803 human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line was treated with rAd-p53 or/and EPI or left untreated as a blank control. Cell growth, flow cytometry, Wright's staining, and cyto-immunochemistry were used to analyze the therapeutic efficacy of the different treatment groups. Results: After treating MGC-803 on days 1, 2, 3 & 6, the cell inhibition rates were 34.52%, 10.53%, 58.98% and 79.17%, respectively, for rAd-p53 group; 60.71%, 67.29%, 73.21% and 95.14%, respectively, for EPI group; and 59.52%, 66.17%, 67.15% and 99.31%, respectively, for the combined group. The combined group was significantly higher than that of single agent groups (P<0.01). Based on the flow cytometry, we found that rAd-p53 blocked the cell cycle at G2/M phase (44.243%) and a higher Sub-G1 peak was observed. In the combined group, the G2/M phase (81.734%) and Sub-G1 peak were significantly evident (P<0.01). Decreased cell number, abnormal cell morphology and apoptotic cells were found under Wright's staining, and p53 protein stained positively in the nucleus and cytoplasm by immunochemical analysis in rAd-p53 treated group, especially in the combined treatment group. The EPI group was not different from the blank control. Conclusion: The gene therapy agent rAd-p53 has an inhibiting and apoptotic effect on MGC-803 cells, thus it could enhance the chemotherapeutic effect of EPI on MGC-803 cells, suggesting synergism between gene therapy and chemotherapy.

84875634965	Development in the research of contrast enhanced multi-sliced computed tomography in the diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis	Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is derived from metastatic dissemination of malignant cancer in the peritoneal cavity. Precise preoperative evaluation of the PC status is very important for clinical treatment. Among the current preoperative diagnosis modalities, contrast-enhanced multi-sliced computed tomography (MSCT) has unique advantages because of its availability, simplicity, high-speed, good space resolution, and less movement artifacts. Based on thorough literature study of current MSCT researches, this review is focused on the CT signs, CT-based peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) evaluation, and major impact factors on CT diagnosis. The CT signs of PC are ascites, peritoneal thickening and enhancement, and involving signs of greater omentum and bowel. According to the principle of PCI, CT can predict the extent of PC to choose appropriate patients to receive surgery. Major factors affecting CT diagnosis are technical properties of CT equipment, tumor size and location of the PC, and the experience and knowledge of the radiologist. More attention should be paid to the tumors <5 mm and the tumor nodules in special regions in order to improve diagnosis.

84874985208	Recognition and capture of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cells using aptamer-conjugated quantum dots and magnetic particles	Metastatic recurrence is the most important biological behavior of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the main cause of treatment failure. Early prediction of metastasis is currently impossible due to the lack of specific molecular probes to recognize metastatic HCC cells. Aptamers have recently emerged as promising potential molecular probes for biomedical applications. Two well-matched HCC cell lines including HCCLM9 with high metastatic potential and MHCC97-L with low metastatic potential, were used to select aptamers for HCC metastasis. With a whole-cell-SELEX strategy, in which HCCLM9 cells were used as target cells and MHCC97-L cells as subtractive cell, 6 potential aptamers had been generated. Detailed study on selected aptamer LY-1 revealed that it could bind metastatic HCC cells with high affinity and specificity, not only in cells culture and animal models of HCC metastasis, but also in clinical HCC specimens. Moreover, the aptamer LY-1 and magnetic particles conjugates could efficiently capture the HCC cells from complex mixture whole blood. These studies demonstrated that this HCC specific aptamer LY-1 could be a promising molecular probe to recognize metastatic HCC cells. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84876341882	Quantum dots for cancer research: current status, remaining issues, and future perspectives	Cancer is a major threat to public health in the 21st century because it is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The mechanisms of carcinogenesis, cancer invasion, and metastasis remain unclear. Thus, the development of a novel approach for cancer detection is urgent, and real-time monitoring is crucial in revealing its underlying biological mechanisms. With the optical and chemical advantages of quantum dots (QDs), QD-based nanotechnology is helpful in constructing a biomedical imaging platform for cancer behavior study. This review mainly focuses on the application of QD-based nanotechnology in cancer cell imaging and tumor microenvironment studies both in vivo and in vitro, as well as the remaining issues and future perspectives. © 2012 by Cancer Biology & Medicine.

84876963095	Effects of CYP2C19 Loss-of-Function Variants on the Eradication of H. pylori Infection in Patients Treated with Proton Pump Inhibitor-Based Triple Therapy Regimens: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials	Background: There are inconsistent conclusions about whether CYP2C19 variants could affect H. pylori eradication rate in patients treated with the proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based therapy. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to re-evaluate the impact of CYP2C19 variants on PPI-based triple therapy for the above indication. Methods: All relevant RCTs in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science and two Chinese databases (up to February 2013) were systematically searched, and a pooled analysis was performed with the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) by the STATA software. Results: Sixteen RCT datasets derived from 3680 patients were included. There was no significant heterogeneity across the data available in this meta-analysis. There were significant differences in that rate between homozygous (HomEMs) and heterozygous (HetEMs) extensive metabolizers (OR 0.724; 95% CI 0.594-0.881), between HomEMs and poor metabolizers (PM) (OR 0.507; 95%CI 0.379-0.679), or between HetEMs and PMs (OR 0.688; 95%CI 0.515-0.920), regardless of the PPI being taken. Furthermore, sub-analysis of individual PPIs was carried out to explore the difference across all the PPIs used. A significantly low rate was seen in HomEMs vs. HetEMs taking either omeprazole (OR 0.329; 95%CI 0.195-0.553) or lansoprazole (OR 0.692; 95%CI 0.485-0.988), and also in HomEMs vs. PMs for omeprazole (OR 0.232; 95%CI 0.105-0.515) or lansoprazole (OR 0.441; 95%CI 0.252-0.771). However, there was no significant difference between HetEMs and PMs taking either one. No significant differences were observed for rabeprazole or esomeprazole across the CYP2C19 genotypes of interest. Conclusions: Carriage of CYP2C19 loss-of-function variants is associated with increased H. pylori eradication rate in patients taking PPI-based triple therapies when omeprazole or lansoprazole is chosen. However, there is no a class effect after use of rabeprazole or esomeprazole. © 2013 Tang et al.

84879098366	Combined features based on MT1-MMP expression, CD11b + immunocytes density and LNR predict clinical outcomes of gastric cancer	Background: Given the complexity of tumor microenvironment, no single marker from cancer cells could adequately predict the clinical outcomes of gastric cancer (GC). The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic role of combined features including conventional pathology, proteinase and immune data in GC.Methods: In addition to pathological studies, immunohistochemistry was used to assess membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) expression and CD11b + immunocytes density in three independent GC tissue microarrays containing 184 GC tissues. Separate and combined features were evaluated for their impact on overall survival (OS).Results: We found that traditional factors including tumor size, histological grade, lymph node status, serosa invasion and TNM stage were associated with OS (P < 0.05 for all). Moreover, statistically significant differences in OS were found among lymph node ratio (LNR) subgroups (P < 0.001), MT1-MMP subgroups (P = 0.015), and CD11b + immunocytes density subgroups (P = 0.031). Most importantly, combined feature (MT1-MMP positive, low CD11b + immunocytes density and high LNR) was found by multivariate analysis to be an independent prognostic factors for OS after excluding other confounding factors (HR = 3.818 [95%CI: 2.223-6.557], P < 0.001). In addition, this combined feature had better performance in predicting clinical outcomes after surgery long before recurrence had occurred (Area under the curve: 0.689 [95%CI: 0.609-0.768], P < 0.001).Conclusions: These findings indicate that better information on GC prognosis could be obtained from combined clinico-pathological factors, tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. © 2013 Peng et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84880237737	Coevolution of the tumor microenvironment revealed by quantum dot-based multiplexed imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma	Aim: This study aimed to provide new insights into the mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) invasion by simultaneously imaging tumor cells and major components of the tumor microenvironment. Materials & methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human HCC tissues were studied by conventional immunohistochemistry and quantum dot-based multiplexed imaging to reveal type IV collagen, LOX and tumor angiogenesis. Results: Type IV collagen degradation and repatterning in the extracellular matrix (ECM) was a continuous process, making the ECM harder, although more fragile and less resistant to cancer invasion. The distribution of LOX among cancer nests was heterogeneous, with higher expression in small cancer nests and lower expression in large cancer nests. LOX expression in cancer cells was associated with rigid stroma and tumor angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis occurred with type IV collagen presence. At the cancer invasion front, the ECM was hydrolyzed, with the prominent linear reorientation of type IV collagen surrounding cancer nests adjacent to neovessels. Conclusion: The visualization of the temporal-spatial relationship between type IV collagen, LOX and tumor angiogenesis revealed the coevolution process of HCC cells and their microenvironment, emphasizing an active role of the ECM during cancer invasion. © 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.

84880297428	Evaluation of the staging systems for gastric cancer	Background Some staging systems for gastric cancer (GC) have been developed as alternatives to the 6th and 7th TNM staging systems, including the Hybrid, tumor-ratio-metastasis (TRM), and Kiel staging systems. This study evaluated the overall performance of these systems for GC. Methods A total of 540 GC patients undergoing surgical resection were staged using these five systems. Homogeneity, discrimination power, predictive accuracy, and complexity of these systems were compared. Results Multivariate analyses showed that all of 7th pT, pN, and pM classifications were independent factors for GC prognosis (P < 0.001 for all). Compared with the other four systems, 7th TNM system had improved stage groups homogeneity (7 of 8 stage groups homogeneous), enhanced discrimination power (4 of 5, 5 of 7, 4 of 7, 3 of 7, and 1 of 4 adjacent stage groups were differentiated by the 6th, 7th TNM, Hybrid, TRM, and Kiel systems, respectively), and better prediction value for GC patients' outcome (AUC = 0.801, P < 0.001). In addition, the 7th TNM system did not increase the staging complexity (9 groups and 21 subgroups). Conclusions The 7th TNM staging system represents advancement in GC staging system for better prediction of clinical outcomes. J. Surg. Oncol. 2013; 108:93-105. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84881278668	In Vitro invasive pattern of hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HCCLM9 based on three-dimensional cell culture and quantum dots molecular imaging	This study aimed to establish a new in vitro three-dimensional (3D) cell culture and use quantum dots (QDs) molecular imaging to examine the invasive behaviors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Each well of the 24-well cell culture plate was cover-slipped. Matrigel diluted with serum-free DMEM was added and HCCLM9 cells were cultured on the Matrigel. The cell morphological and cell growth characteristics were observed by inverted microscopy and laser confocal microscopy at different culture time. Cell invasive features were monitored by QDs-based real-time molecular imaging techniques. The results showed that on this 3D cell culture platform, HCCLM9 cells exhibited typical multi-step invasive behaviors, including reversion of cell senescence, active focal proliferation and dominant clones invasion. During the process, cells under 3D cell culture showed biological behaviors of spatio-temporal characteristics. Cells first merged on the surface of matrix, then gradually infiltrated and migrated into deep part of matrix, presenting polygonal morphology with stretched protrusions, forming tubular, annular and even network structure, which suggested that HCC cells have the morphological basis for vasculogenic mimicry. In addition, small cell clones with their edges well-circumscribed in early stage, progressed into a large irregular clone with ill-defined edge, while the other cells developed invadopodia. And QDs probing showed MT1-MMP was strongly expressed in the invadopodia. These findings indicate that a novel 3D cell culture platform has been successfully established, which can mimic the in vivo tumor microenvironment, and when combined with QDs-based molecular imaging, it can help to better investigate the invasive behaviors of HCC cells. © 2013 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84882433049	Targeting therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma with doxorubicin prodrug PDOX increases anti-metastatic effect and reduces toxicity: A preclinical study	Background: This study was to investigate the effects and safety of cathepsin B-cleavable doxorubicin (DOX)-prodrug (PDOX) for targeting therapy of metastatic human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using DOX as a positive control drug.Methods: The orthotopic nude mice model of highly metastatic HCC was established and the animals were randomized and treated with PDOX, DOX and saline, respectively. Hematology, biochemistry and tumor markers were studied. At autopsy, liver tumor weight and size, ascites, abdominal lymph nodes metastases, experimental peritoneal carcinomatosis index (ePCI), and tumor-host body weight ratio were investigated. Immunohistochemical studies and western blotting were done to investigate key molecules involved in the mechanism of action.Results: Compared with Control, both PDOX and DOX could similarly and significantly reduce liver tumor weight and tumor volume by over 40%, ePCI values, retroperitoneal lymph node metastases and lung metastases and serum AFP levels (P < 0.05). The PDOX group had significantly higher WBC than the DOX group (P < 0.05), and higher PLT than Control (P < 0.05). Serum BUN and Cr levels were lower in the PDOX group than DOX and Control groups (P < 0.05). Compared with Control, DOX increased CK and CK-MB; while PDOX decreased CK compared with DOX (P < 0.05). Multiple spotty degenerative changes of the myocardium were observed in DOX-treated mice, but not in the Control and PDOX groups. PDOX could significantly reduce the Ki-67 positive rate of tumor cells, compared with DOX and Control groups. PDOX produced the effects at least via the ERK pathway.Conclusion: Compared with DOX, PDOX may have better anti-metastatic efficacy and reduced side effects especially cardio-toxicities in this HCC model. © 2013 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84882614622	Anticancer effects of Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-doxorubicin via mitochondria-centered apoptosis involving reactive oxidative stress and the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in MGC-803 cells	Ac-Phe-Lys-PABC-DOX (PDOX) is a smart doxorubicin (DOX) prodrug designed to decrease toxicities while maintaining the potent anticancer effects of DOX. The present study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of action of PDOX using MGC-803 gastric cancer cells as a model. The cells were treated with both PDOX and DOX, and cytotoxicities, cell cycle analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial damage and ERK1/2 signaling pathway alterations were studied. Abundant cathepsin B expression was observed in the MGC-803 cells, and treatment with PDOX and DOX triggered dose-dependent cytotoxicity and resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability. IC50 of PDOX and DOX was 14.9 and 4.9 μM, respectively. Both PDOX and DOX significantly decreased p-ERK1/2, increased ROS generation, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, caused mitochondrial swelling and arrested the cell cycle at the G2/S phase, and these effects were more pronounced for PDOX than for DOX. PDOX and DOX have different mechanisms of action, particularly the mitochondria-centered intrinsic apoptosis involving reactive oxidative stress and the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.

84882794935	Ultrasound-assisted chemical cleaning of polyvinylidene fluoride membrane fouled by lactic acid fermentation broth	Ultrasound-assisted chemical cleaning was applied to remove foulants on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) ultrafiltration membranes used to treat lactic acid fermentation broth. The cleaning effects of four chemicals, namely, deionized water, NaOH, NaClO, and a mixture of NaOH and NaClO, were compared through normalized permeate flux. The obtained results indicated that 45% of the normalized permeate flux can be achieved by cleaning with 1% of the mixture. This percentage can be enhanced to 97.5% through ultrasound. Scanning electron micrographs showed that deionized water can only remove part of foulants on the membrane surface, whereas the other three solutions can eliminate the surface foulants completely. Membrane fouling and flux decline were mainly caused by the foulants inside the membrane pores. Three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum analysis showed new fluorescent compounds generated by the oxidation effect of NaClO. Energy dispersive X-ray spectra showed that NaClO can decrease the oxygen content of the PVDF membrane. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84882924539	Quantum dots-based in situ molecular imaging of dynamic changes of collagen IV during cancer invasion	Cancer invasion and metastasis remains the root cause of mortality. This process involves alterations of tumor microenvironment, particularly the remodeling of extracellular matrix, characterized by collagen IV uncoiling, degradation, fragments deposition and cross-linking. Quantum dots-labeled molecular probes are promising platforms to simultaneously study several subtle changes of key biomolecules, because of their unique optical and chemical properties. Here we report on a quantum dots-based imaging technology to study key components in tumor microenvironment during cancer progression, so as to gain new insights into the role of collagen IV plays, to define the cancer "invasion unit" and to develop the "pulse-mode" of cancer invasion. © 2013 The Authors.

84883277052	High-throughput analytical techniques for multiresidue, multiclass determination of 653 pesticides and chemical pollutants in tea-part III: Evaluation of the cleanup efficiency of an SPE cartridge newly developed for multiresidues in tea	A comparative study was conducted over three stages on the cleanup efficiency of SPE cartridge Cleanert TPT, newly developed for multigroups of pesticide residues in tea. In Stage I, different SPE cartridges C18, graphite carbon black (GCB), primary secondary amine (PSA), and amino (NH2) were purchased and combined into 12 different sequences. Through the comparative test on cleanup efficiency of 84 representative pesticides in tea, Envi-Carb GCB + PSA with a good cleanup effect was selected. In Stage II, GC/MS test results from the comparative study of the extraction efficiency of 201 pesticides spiked into green tea and Woolong tea with Cleanert TPT and Envi-Carb + PSA SPE showed that average recoveries fell within 70-110% and RSD <20% for 193 and 184 pesticides, respectively, for green tea, accounting for 96.0 and 91.0% of the total number, respectively. GC/MS/MS test results also found 193 and 184 pesticides, respectively, meeting the recovery and RSD conditions, accounting for 96.0 and 91.5%, respectively, of the total number. For Woolong tea samples, GC/MS results showed that with Cleanert TPT and Envi-Carb + PSA SPE for cleanup, there were 192 and 177 pesticides, respectively, meeting the conditions, accounting for 95.5 and 88.1% of the total number, respectively. GC/MS/MS results demonstrated that there were 195 and 184 pesticides, respectively, meeting the conditions, accounting for 97.0 and 91.5% of the total number, respectively. It was seen that Cleanert TPT was superior to Envi-Carb + PSA in cleanup efficiency, whether for green or Woolong tea samples, or GC/MS or GC/MS/MS determination. In Stage III, 61 104 results of the average content value of pesticides and RSD (two teas × two Youden pair concentrations × two kinds of SPE cartridges × two instruments × 19 tests × 201 pesticides) were derived from the 19 times stability tests over 3 months by paralleling three samples every 5 days via two instruments with two kinds of SPE cartridges for cleanup, respectively, against Youden Pair samples of the 201 incurred pesticides from green and Woolong teas. The statistical analysis found that detected values from the target pesticides of the incurred Youden pair samples showed no marked differences with cleanup by either Cleanert TPT or Envi-Carb + PSA, whether for green or Woolong tea, or GC/MS or GC/MS/MS. The test results using the two aforementioned kinds of SPE cleanup for above 93% pesticides had a tolerance less than 15%, which testifies that both cartridge cleanups met the requirement for pesticide residue analysis.

84883079428	Synthesis and self-assembly of two 1,3-alternate thiacalix[4]arenes derivatives bearing amide groups	Two 1,3-alternate thiacalix[4]arene derivatives bearing amide groups, 1,3-alternate p-tert-butylthiacalix[4]arene tetraamide (4), and 1,3-alternate p-H-thiacalix[4]arene tetraamide (6) were prepared, and their crystal structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction method. The steric hindrances posed by tert-butyl groups play an important part in the synthesis and the self-assembly of the two compounds. Compound 6 was synthesized from the corresponding ester, which was obtained by the reaction of acid chloride with ammonia. In the crystal structure, compound 4 presents a highly symmetric molecular structure, while for compound 6, because of absence of tert-butyl groups, it presents a more flexible molecular structure. © 2013 Wuhan University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
