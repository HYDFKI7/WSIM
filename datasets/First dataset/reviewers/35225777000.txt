84927712228	Measurement of the W boson polarization in top decay at CDF at √s = 1.8 TeV	The polarization of the W boson in t →Wb decay is unambiguously predicted by the standard model of electroweak interactions and is a powerful test of our understanding of the tbW vertex. We measure this polarization from the invariant mass of the b quark from t → Wb and the lepton from W → lν whose momenta measure the W decay angle and direction of motion, respectively. In this paper we present a measurement of the decay rate (f <inf>V</inf>+A) of the W produced from the decay of the top quark in the hypothesis of V + A structure of the tWb vertex. We find no evidence for the nonstandard V + A vertex and set a limit on f<inf>V+A</inf> < 0.80 at 95% confidence level. By combining this result with a complementary observable in the same data, we assign a limit on f<inf>v+A</inf> < 0.61 at 95% CL. This corresponds to a constraint on the right-handed helicity component of the W polarization of f<inf>+</inf> < 0.18 at 95% CL. This limit is the first significant direct constraint on f<inf>V+A</inf> in top decay. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

84927780885	Comparison of three-jet events in pp̄ collisions at √s = 1.8 TeV to predictions from a next-to-leading order QCD calculation	The properties of three-jet events with total transverse energy greater than 320 GeV and individual jet energy greater than 20 GeV have been analyzed and compared to absolute predictions from a next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD calculation. These data, of integrated luminosity 86 pb <sup>-1</sup>, were recorded by the CDF Experiment for pp collisions at √s = 1.8 TeV This study tests a model of higher order QCD processes that result in gluon emission and may give some indication of the magnitude of the contribution of processes higher than NLO.

The differential cross section is furthermore measured for all kinematically accessible regions of the Dalitz plane, including those for which the theoretical prediction is unreliable.

84927801918	Search for heavy long-lived charged particles in pp collisions at √s=7 TeV	The result of a search for heavy long-lived charged particles produced in pp collisions at √s=7 TeV at the LHC is described. The data sample has been collected using the CMS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb<sup>-1</sup>. The inner tracking detectors are used to define a sample of events containing tracks with high momentum and high ionization energy loss. A second sample of events, which have high-momentum tracks satisfying muon identification requirements in addition to meeting high-ionization and long time-of-flight requirements, is analyzed independently. In both cases, the results are consistent with the expected background estimated from data. The results are used to establish cross section limits as a function of mass within the context of models with long-lived gluinos, scalar top quarks and scalar taus. Cross section limits on hyper-meson particles, containing new elementary long-lived hyper-quarks predicted by a vector-like confinement model, are also presented. Lower limits at 95% confidence level on the mass of gluinos (scalar top quarks) are found to be 1098 (737) GeV/c<sup>2</sup>. A limit of 928 (626) GeV/c<sup>2</sup> is set for a gluino (scalar top quark) that hadronizes into a neutral bound state before reaching the muon detectors. The lower mass limit for a pair produced scalar tau is found to be 223 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>. Mass limits for a hyper-kaon are placed at 484, 602, and 747 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> for hyper-ρ masses of 800, 1200, and 1600 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, respectively. © 2012 CERN.

Analyses of KS0 and Λ0 multiplicity and transverse momentum distributions, as well as of the dependencies of the average number and pT of KS0 and Λ0 on charged particle multiplicity, are reported.

We study W→eνe and W→μνμ candidate events produced in association with at least one jet at CDF, during Run Ia and Run Ib of the Tevatron at s=1.8TeV. The corresponding integrated luminosity was 110pb-1. The jet balances the transverse momentum of the W and introduces QCD effects in W boson production. The extraction of the angular coefficients is achieved through the direct measurement of the azimuthal angle of the charged lepton in the Collins-Soper rest-frame of the W boson. The angular coefficients are measured as a function of the transverse momentum of the W boson.

We identify tt̄ candidates where both W bosons from the top quarks decay into leptons (eν, μν, or τν) from a data sample of 360pb-1. The top quark mass is reconstructed in each event separately by three different methods, which draw upon simulated distributions of the neutrino pseudorapidity, tt̄ longitudinal momentum, or neutrino azimuthal angle in order to extract probability distributions for the top quark mass. For each method, representative mass distributions, or templates, are constructed from simulated samples of signal and background events, and parametrized to form continuous probability density functions. A likelihood fit incorporating these parametrized templates is then performed on the data sample masses in order to derive a final top quark mass. Combining the three template methods, taking into account correlations in their statistical and systematic uncertainties, results in a top quark mass measurement of 170.1±6.0(stat.)±4.1(syst.)

Scalar bottom quarks can be produced from gluino decays in R-parity conserving models of supersymmetry when the mass of the gluino exceeds that of the scalar bottom quark. Then, a scalar bottom quark can decay into a bottom quark and a neutralino. To search for this scenario, we investigated events with large missing transverse energy and at least three jets, two or more of which were identified as containing a secondary vertex from the hadronization of b quarks. We found four candidate events, where 2.6±0.7 are expected from standard model processes, and placed 95% confidence level lower limits on gluino and scalar bottom quark masses of up to 280 and 240GeV/c2, respectively. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646492293	Measurement of the top quark mass with the dynamical likelihood method using lepton plus jets events with b-tags in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	This paper describes a measurement of the top quark mass, Mtop, with the dynamical likelihood method (DLM) using the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. The Tevatron produces top/antitop (tt̄) pairs in pp̄ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The data sample used in this analysis was accumulated from March 2002 through August 2004, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 318pb-1. We use the tt̄ candidates in the "lepton+jets" decay channel, requiring at least one jet identified as a b quark by finding a displaced secondary vertex. The DLM defines a likelihood for each event based on the differential cross section as a function of Mtop per unit phase space volume of the final partons, multiplied by the transfer functions from jet to parton energies. The method takes into account all possible jet combinations in an event, and the likelihood is multiplied event by event to derive the top quark mass by the maximum likelihood method. Using 63 tt̄ candidates observed in the data, with 9.2 events expected from background, we measure the top quark mass to be 173.2+2.6-2.4(stat.)±3. 2(syst.)GeV/c2, or 173.2+4.1-4.0GeV/c2. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33747635979	Measurement of the b jet cross section in events with a Z boson in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	A measurement of the inclusive bottom jet cross section is presented for events containing a Z boson in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV using the Collider Detector at Fermilab. Z bosons are identified in their electron and muon decay modes, and b jets with ET>20GeV and |η|<1.5 are identified by reconstructing a secondary decay vertex. The measurement is based on an integrated luminosity of about 330pb-1. A cross section times branching ratio of σ(Z+bjets)×B(Z→ℓ+ℓ-)=0.93±0.36pb is found, where B(Z→ℓ+ℓ-) is the branching ratio of the Z boson or γ* into a single flavor dilepton pair (e or μ) in the mass range between 66 and 116GeV/c2. The ratio of b jets to the total number of jets of any flavor in the Z sample, within the same kinematic range as the b jets, is 2.36±0.92%. Here, the uncertainties are the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties. Predictions made with next-to-leading order QCD agree, within experimental and theoretical uncertainties, with these measurements. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The likelihood in top quark mass is calculated for each event by convoluting the leading order matrix element describing qq̄→tt̄→blνlb̄l′νl′ with detector resolution functions. The presence of background events in the data sample is modeled using similar calculations involving the matrix elements for major background processes. In a data sample with integrated luminosity of 340pb-1, we observe 33 candidate events and measure Mtop=165.2±6.1(stat.) ±3.4(syst.)GeV/c2. This measurement represents the first application of this method to events with two charged leptons and is the most precise single measurement of the top quark mass in this channel. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The sample contains signals of 3600 fully reconstructed hadronic Bs decays and 37000 partially reconstructed semileptonic Bs decays. We measure the probability as a function of proper decay time that the Bs decays with the same, or opposite, flavor as the flavor at production, and we find a signal consistent with Bs0-B̄s0 oscillations. The probability that random fluctuations could produce a comparable signal is 0.2%. Under the hypothesis that the signal is due to Bs0-B̄s0 oscillations, we measure Δms=17.31-0.18+0.33(stat)±0. 07(syst)ps-1 and determine |Vtd/Vts|=0.208-0.002+0.001(expt)-0.006+0.008(theor). © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33749159214	Measurements of bottom-antibottom azimuthal production correlations in proton-antiproton collisions at s=1.8TeV	We have measured the azimuthal angular correlation of bb̄ production, using 86.5pb-1 of data collected by Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) in pp̄ collisions at s=1.8TeV during 1994-1995. In high-energy pp̄ collisions, such as at the Tevatron, bb̄ production can be schematically categorized into three mechanisms. The leading-order (LO) process is "flavor creation," where both b and b̄ quarks substantially participate in the hard scattering and result in a distinct back-to-back signal in final state. The "flavor excitation" and the "gluon splitting" processes, which appear at next-leading-order (NLO), are known to make a comparable contribution to total bb̄ cross section, while providing very different opening angle distributions from the LO process. An azimuthal opening angle between bottom and antibottom, Δ, has been used for the correlation measurement to probe the interaction creating bb̄ pairs. The Δ distribution has been obtained from two different methods. One method measures the Δ between bottom hadrons using events with two reconstructed secondary vertex tags. The other method uses bb̄→(J/ ψX)(X′) events, where the charged lepton () is an electron (e) or a muon (μ), to measure Δ between bottom quarks. The bb̄ purity is determined as a function of Δ by fitting the decay length of the J/ψ and the impact parameter of the. Both methods quantify the contribution from higher-order production mechanisms by the fraction of the bb̄ pairs produced in the same azimuthal hemisphere, ftoward. The measured ftoward values are consistent with both parton shower Monte Carlo and NLO QCD predictions. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

A b-tagging algorithm based on the probability of displaced tracks coming from the event interaction vertex is applied to identify b quarks from top decay. Using 318pb-1 of data collected with the CDF II detector, we measure the tt̄ production cross section in events with at least one restrictive (tight) b-tagged jet and obtain 8.9-1.0+1.0(stat)-1.0+1.1(syst)pb. The cross section value assumes a top quark mass of mt=178GeV/c2 in the acceptance corrections. The dependence of the cross section on mt is presented in the paper. This result is consistent with other CDF measurements of the tt̄ cross section using different samples and analysis techniques, and has similar systematic uncertainties. We have also performed consistency checks by using the b-tagging probability function to vary the signal-to-background ratio and also using events that have at least two b-tagged jets. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

3543011174	Charged jet evolution and the underlying event in proton-antiproton collisions at 1.8 TeV	The growth and development of "charged particle jets" produced in proton-antiproton collisions at 1.8 TeV are studied over a transverse momentum range from 0.5 GeV/c to 50 GeV/c. A variety of leading (highest transverse momentum) charged jet observables are compared with the QCD Monte Carlo models HERWIG, ISAJET, and PYTHIA. The models describe fairly well the multiplicity distribution of charged particles within the leading charged jet, the size of the leading charged jet, the radial distribution of charged particles and transverse momentum around the leading charged jet direction, and the momentum distribution of charged particles within the leading charged jet. The direction of the leading "charged particle jet" in each event is used to define three regions of η-φ space. The "toward" region contains the leading "charged particle jet," while the "away" region, on the average, contains the away-side jet. The "transverse" region is perpendicular to the plane of the hard 2-to-2 scattering and is very sensitive to the "underlying event" component of the QCD Monte Carlo models. HERWIG, ISAJET, and PYTHIA with their default parameters do not describe correctly all the properties of the "transverse" region.

33244465223	Top quark mass measurement using the template method in the lepton+jets channel at CDF II	This article presents a measurement of the top quark mass using the CDF II detector at Fermilab. Colliding beams of protons and antiprotons at Fermilab's Tevatron (s=1.96TeV) produce top/antitop pairs, which decay to W+W-bb̄; events are selected where one W decays to hadrons and the other W decays to either e or μ plus a neutrino. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately 318pb-1. A total of 165 tt̄ events are separated into four subsamples based on jet transverse energy thresholds and the number of b jets identified by reconstructing a displaced vertex. In each event, the reconstructed top quark invariant mass is determined by minimizing a χ2 for the overconstrained kinematic system. At the same time, the mass of the hadronically decaying W boson is measured in the same event sample. The observed W boson mass provides an in situ improvement in the determination of the hadronic jet energy scale. A simultaneous likelihood fit of the reconstructed top quark masses and the W boson invariant masses in the data sample to distributions from simulated signal and background events gives a top quark mass of 173.5-3.8+3.9GeV/c2. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The spectrum is fit with predictions for odd C-parity (S13, P11, and DJ3) charmonia decaying to J/ψπ+π-, as well as even C-parity states in which the pions are from ρ0 decay. The latter case also encompasses exotic interpretations, such as a D0D̄*0 molecule. Only the S13 and J/ψρ hypotheses are compatible with our data. Since S13 is untenable on other grounds, decay via J/ψρ is favored, which implies C=+1 for the X(3872). Models for different J/ψ-ρ angular momenta L are considered. Flexibility in the models, especially the introduction of ρ-ω interference, enables good descriptions of our data for both L=0 and 1. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The charged-hadron yield is obtained by counting the number of reconstructed hits, hit pairs, and fully reconstructed charged-particle tracks. The combination of the three methods gives a charged-particle multiplicity per unit of pseudorapidity dNch/ dη|η|<0.5 = 5.78 ± 0.01(stat)±0.23(syst) for non-single-diffractive events, higher than predicted by commonly used models.

Nearly 15% of the detector was instrumented using cables, fiber optics, power supplies, and electronics intended for the operation at the LHC.

A statistical analysis of the data provides a lower limit on the energy scale of quark contact interactions. The sensitivity of the analysis is such that the expected limit is 2.9 TeV; because the observed value of the centrality ratio at high invariant mass is below the expectation, the observed limit is 4.0 TeV at the 95% confidence level. © 2010 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

78650567845	Precise mapping of the magnetic field in the CMS barrel yoke using cosmic rays	The CMS detector is designed around a large 4 T superconducting solenoid, enclosed in a 12 000-tonne steel return yoke. A detailed map of the magnetic field is required for the accurate simulation and reconstruction of physics events in the CMS detector, not only in the inner tracking region inside the solenoid but also in the large and complex structure of the steel yoke, which is instrumented with muon chambers. Using a large sample of cosmic muon events collected by CMS in 2008, the field in the steel of the barrel yoke has been determined with a precision of 3 to 8% depending on the location. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

78650583003	Alignment of the CMS silicon tracker during commissioning with cosmic rays	The CMS silicon tracker, consisting of 1440 silicon pixel and 15 148 silicon strip detector modules, has been aligned using more than three million cosmic ray charged particles, with additional information from optical surveys. The positions of the modules were determined with respect to cosmic ray trajectories to an average precision of 3-4 microns RMS in the barrel and 3-14 microns RMS in the endcap in the most sensitive coordinate. The results have been validated by several studies, including laser beam cross-checks, track fit self-consistency, track residuals in overlapping module regions, and track parameter resolution, and are compared with predictions obtained from simulation. Correlated systematic effects have been investigated. The track parameter resolutions obtained with this alignment are close to the design performance. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

79951781401	Alignment of the CMS muon system with cosmic-ray and beam-halo muons	The CMS muon system has been aligned using cosmic-ray muons collected in 2008 and beam-halo muons from the 2008 LHC circulating beam tests. After alignment, the resolution of the most sensitive coordinate is 80 microns for the relative positions of superlayers in the same barrel chamber and 270 microns for the relative positions of endcap chambers in the same ring structure. The resolution on the position of the central barrel chambers relative to the tracker is comprised between two extreme estimates, 200 and 700 microns, provided by two complementary studies.

Efficiencies of various high-level trigger, identification, and reconstruction algorithms have been measured for a broad range of muon momenta, and were found to be in good agreement with expectations from Monte Carlo simulation. The relative momentum resolution for muons crossing the barrel part of the detector is better than 1% at 10 GeV/c and is about 8% at 500 GeV/c, the latter being only a factor of two worse than expected with ideal alignment conditions.

79953014406	Search for supersymmetry in pp collisions at 7 TeV in events with jets and missing transverse energy	A search for supersymmetry with R-parity conservation in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is presented. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35 pb-1 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is performed in events with jets and significant missing transverse energy, characteristic of the decays of heavy, pair-produced squarks and gluinos. The primary background, from standard model multijet production, is reduced by several orders of magnitude to a negligible level by the application of a set of robust kinematic requirements. With this selection, the data are consistent with the standard model backgrounds, namely tt, W. +. jet and Z. +. jet production, which are estimated from data control samples. Limits are set on the parameters of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model. These limits extend those set previously by experiments at the Tevatron and LEP colliders. © 2011 CMS Collaboration.

Algorithms have been developed to identify and address these problems in the data. The methods have been tested on cosmic ray muon data, calorimeter noise data, and single beam data collected with CMS in 2008. The noise rejection algorithms can be applied to LHC collision data at the trigger level or in the offline analysis. The application of the algorithms at the trigger level is shown to remove 90% of noise events with fake missing transverse energy above 100 GeV, which is sufficient for the CMS physics trigger operation. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

79953272770	Aligning the CMS muon chambers with the muon alignment system during an extended cosmic ray run	The alignment system for the muon spectrometer of the CMS detector comprises three independent subsystems of optical and analog position sensors. It aligns muon chambers with respect to each other and to the central silicon tracker. System commissioning at full magnetic field began in 2008 during an extended cosmic ray run. The system succeeded in tracking muon detector movements of up to 18 mm and rotations of several milliradians under magnetic forces. Depending on coordinate and subsystem, the system achieved chamber alignment precisions of 140-350 μm and 30-200 μrad, close to the precision requirements of the experiment. Systematic errors on absolute positions are estimated to be 340-590 μm based on comparisons with independent photogrammetry measurements. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

The main goal of the calibration is to determine, for each drift cell, the minimum time delay for signals relative to the trigger, accounting for the drift velocity within the cell. The accuracy of the calibration procedure is influenced by the random arrival time of the cosmic muons relative to the LHC clock cycle. A more refined analysis of the drift velocity was performed during the offline reconstruction phase, which takes into account this feature of cosmic ray events. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

The ratio of the number of DPE events in the region to the total number of events in the sample was 0.194±0.001±0.012. It was found that the value was lower than the prediction based on Regge factorization by a factor of 1.9 ± 0.2. It was indicated that the formation of a second rapidity gap in a single diffractive (SD) event is relatively unsuppressed. It was observed that the results favor those in which the Regge based shapes of the SD and DPE distributions remain unchanged and only the overall normalization is suppressed.

80051551406	Underlying event in hard interactions at the Fermilab Tevatron p̄p collider	For comparison of inclusive jet cross sections measured at hadron-hadron colliders to next-to-leading order (NLO) parton-level calculations, the energy deposited in the jet cone by spectator parton interactions must first be subtracted. The assumption made at the Tevatron is that the spectator parton interaction energy is similar to the ambient level measured in minimum bias events. In this paper, we test this assumption by measuring the ambient charged track momentum in events containing large transverse energy jets at √s = 1800 GeV and √s = 630 GeV and comparing this ambient momentum with that observed both in minimum bias events and with that predicted by two Monte Carlo models. Two cones in η-φ space are defined, at the same pseudorapidity, η, as the jet with the highest transverse energy (E<inf>T</inf> <sup>(1)</sup>), and at ±90° in the azimuthal direction, φ. The total charged track momentum inside each of the two cones is measured. The minimum momentum in the two cones is almost independent of E<inf>T</inf> <sup>(1)</sup> and is similar to the momentum observed in minimum bias events, whereas the maximum momentum increases roughly linearly with the jet E <inf>T</inf><sup>(1)</sup> over most of the measured range. This study was carried out using data from the CDF detector taken during Run 1 (1994-1995). The study will help improve the precision of comparisons of jet cross section data and NLO perturbative QCD predictions. The distribution of the sum of the track momenta in the two cones is also examined for five different E<inf>T</inf> <sup>(1)</sup> bins. The HERWIG and PYTHIA Monte Carlo generators are reasonably successful in describing the data, but neither can describe completely all of the event properties.

80051551841	Direct photon cross section with conversions at CDF	We present a measurement of the isolated direct photon cross section in p p̄ collisions at √s = 1.8 TeV and |η| < 0.9 using data collected between 1994 and 1995 by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). The measurement is based on events where the photon converts into an electron-positron pair in the material of the inner detector, resulting in a two track event signature. To remove π<sup>0</sup> → γγ and η → γγ events from the data we use a new background subtraction technique which takes advantage of the tracking information available in a photon conversion event. We find that the shape of the cross section as a function of photon p<inf>T</inf> is poorly described by next-to-leading-order QCD predictions, but agrees with previous CDF measurements.

80053362057	Long-range and short-range dihadron angular correlations in central PbPb collisions at psNN = 2:76 TeV	First measurements of dihadron correlations for charged particles are presented for central PbPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 2.76TeV over a broad range in relative pseudorapidity (Δν) and the full range of relative azimuthal angle (Δø). The data were collected with the CMS detector, at the LHC. A broadening of the away-side (Δø y≈ π) azimuthal correlation is observed at all Δν, as compared to the measurements in pp collisions. Furthermore, long-range dihadron correlations in Δν are observed for particles with similar ø values. This phenomenon, also known as the \ridge", persists up to at least jΔνj = 4. For particles with transverse momenta (pT) of 2-4 GeV/c, the ridge is found to be most prominent when these particles are correlated with particles of pT = 2-6 GeV/c, and to be much reduced when paired with particles of pT = 10-12 GeV/c.

80053395960	Charged particle multiplicities in pp interactions at √s = 0.9, 2.36, and 7TeV	Measurements of primary charged hadron multiplicity distributions are presented for non-single-diffractive events in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of √s = 0.9, 2.36, and 7TeV, in five pseudorapidity ranges from |η| < 0.5 to |η| < 2.4. The data were collected with the minimum-bias trigger of the CMS experiment during the LHC commissioning runs in 2009 and the 7TeV run in 2010. The multiplicity distribution at √s = 0.9 TeV is in agreement with previous measurements. At higher energies the increase of the mean multiplicity with √s is underestimated by most event generators. The average transverse momentum as a function of the multiplicity is also presented. The measurement of higher-order moments of the multiplicity distribution confirms the violation of Koba-Nielsen-Olesen scaling that has been observed at lower energies.

In this paper, the results of comprehensive studies of missing transverse energy as measured by the CMS detector are presented. The results cover the measurements of the scale and resolution for missing transverse energy, and the effects of multiple pp interactions within the same bunch crossings on the scale and resolution. Anomalous measurements of missing transverse energy are studied, and algorithms for their identification are described. The performance of several reconstruction algorithms for calculating missing transverse energy are compared. An algorithm, called missing-transverse-energy significance, which estimates the compatibility of the reconstructed missing transverse energy with zero, is described, and its performance is demonstrated. © 2011 CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration, published under license by IOP Publishing Ltd.

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb1 recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011. Events with large total transverse energy have been analyzed for the presence of multiple energetic jets, leptons, and photons, which are typical signals of evaporating semiclassical and quantum black holes, and string balls. Agreement with the expected standard model backgrounds, which are dominated by QCD multijet production, has been observed for various combined multiplicities of jets and other reconstructed objects in the final state. Model-independent limits are set on new physics processes producing high-multiplicity, energetic final states. In addition, new model-specific indicative limits are set excluding semiclassical and quantum black holes with masses below 3.8 to 5.3TeV and string balls with masses below 4.6 to 4.8TeV .

84868541278	Measurement of jet fragmentation into charged particles in pp and PbPb collisions at √s 	Jet fragmentation in pp and PbPb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 2.76TeV per nucleon pair was studied using data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Fragmentation functions are constructed using charged-particle tracks with transverse momenta pT > 4 GeV/c for dijet events with a leading jet of pT > 100 GeV/c. The fragmentation functions in PbPb events are compared to those in pp data as a function of collision centrality, as well as dijet-pT imbalance. Special emphasis is placed on the most central PbPb events including dijets with unbalanced momentum, indicative of energy loss of the hard scattered parent partons. The fragmentation patterns for both the leading and subleading jets in PbPb collisions agree with those seen in pp data at 2.76TeV. The results provide evidence that, despite the large parton energy loss observed in PbPb collisions, the partition of the remaining momentum within the jet cone into high-pT particles is not strongly modified in comparison to that observed for jets in vacuum.

84871443529	A new Boson with a mass of 125 GeV observed with the CMS experiment at the large hadron collider	The Higgs boson was postulated nearly five decades ago within the framework of the standard model of particle physics and has been the subject of numerous searches at accelerators around the world. Its discovery would verify the existence of a complex scalar field thought to give mass to three of the carriers of the electroweak force-the W<sup>+</sup>, W<sup>-</sup>, and Z <sup>0</sup> bosons-as well as to the fundamental quarks and leptons. The CMS Collaboration has observed, with a statistical significance of five standard deviations, a new particle produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The evidence is strongest in the diphoton and four-lepton (electrons and/or muons) final states, which provide the best mass resolution in the CMS detector. The probability of the observed signal being due to a random fluctuation of the background is about 1 in 3 x 10<sup>6</sup>. The new particle is a boson with spin not equal to 1 and has a mass of about 1.25 giga-electron volts. Although its measured properties are, within the uncertainties of the present data, consistent with those expected of the Higgs boson, more data are needed to elucidate the precise nature of the new particle.

We compare the data with predictions from a tree-level QCD calculation and the PYTHIA shower Monte Carlo program. Our data sample is particularly sensitive to contributions from initial- and final-state radiation of photons and jets. Using the PYTHIA Monte Carlo program, we contrast the kinematical distributions for direct photon production with those for initial- and final-state photon radiation (bremsstrahlung). Based on the angular distributions, we find that our data favor a mixture of bremsstrahlung and direct photon production, as predicted, over either process alone.
