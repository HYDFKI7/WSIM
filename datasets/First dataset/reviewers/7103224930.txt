9244265489	Behavior and surface energies of polybenzoxazines formed by polymerization with argon, oxygen, and hydrogen plasmas	Polybenzoxazine (PBZZ) thin films can be fabricated by the plasma-polymerization technique with, as the energy source, plasmas of argon, oxygen, or hydrogen atoms and ions. When benzoxazine (BZZ) films are polymerized through the use of high-energy argon atoms, electronegative oxygen atoms, or excited hydrogen atoms, the PBZZ films that form possess different properties and morphologies in their surfaces. High-energy argon atoms provide a thermodynamic factor to initiate the ring-opening polymerization of BZZ and result in the polymer surface having a grid-like structure. The ring-opening polymerization of the BZZ film that is initiated by cationic species such as oxygen atoms in plasma, is propagated around nodule structures to form the PBZZ. The excited hydrogen atom plasma initiates both polymerization and decomposition reactions simultaneously in the BZZ film and results in the formation of a porous structure on the PBZZ surface. We evaluated the surface energies of the PBZZ films polymerized by the action of these three plasmas by measuring the contact angles of diiodomethane and water droplets. The surface roughness of the films range from 0.5 to 26 nm, depending on the type of carrier gas and the plasma-polymerization time. By estimating changes in thickness, we found that the PBZZ film synthesized by the oxygen plasma-polymerization process undergoes the slowest rate of etching in CF4 plasma. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

14944363099	Electrical detection of DNA hybridization with multilayer gold nanoparticles between nanogap electrodes	This study presents a DNA detection method via hybridization of a probe oligonucleotide with a target DNA and with a substrate oligonucleotide, which leads to self-assembly of gold nanoparticles and a change in the observed current. In contrast to previously reported methods, the present method can be used to detect a target DNA without a silver enhancement step. The device can be washed with 0.3 M PBS below 50 °C for a few minutes, indicating the stringency of target DNA hybridization. Target DNA concentration of as low as 10 picomolar can be detected by this method. Importantly, identification of single-base-pair mismatch in the target DNA can be accomplished with this nano-gap DNA chip. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

We carefully evaluated the critical process parameters, such as mixing-bake temperature, mixing-bake time, plasma etch selectivity, and the profile shapes.

The procedure used is one in which a silver salt is reduced to silver metal by sodium citrate under the influence of microwave irradiation. Key aspects for the production of these nanorods are the use of a closed-chamber microwave heating system that allows precise temperature control and judicious choice of the citrate concentration. This novel finding demonstrates the utility of microwave-assisted synthesis and provides a promising method for the preparation of silver nanorods.

The diluted deep ultraviolet (248 nm) resist is high absorption at the 193 nm regime, which is suitable as bottom layer of bilayer BARC structures. While the deep ultraviolet organic BARC material is low absorption at the 193 nm regime, which is suitable as top layer of bilayer BARC structures. Such a bilayer BARC can have large thickness control tolerances over various highly reflective substrates. The measured swing effect is found significantly reduced by adding such a bilayer BARC on both aluminum and silicon crystal substrates. Reflectance can be reduced to less than 2% on other highly reflectance substrates such as copper, poly-silicon, tungsten silicide, and aluminum silicon. Such a process has several advantages: high performance, relatively in expensive, large thickness control tolerance, low contamination, and easy film removal. © 2002 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

0006806876	One-Step Cleaning Solution to Replace the Conventional RCA Two-Step Cleaning Recipe for Pregate Oxide Cleaning	This work proposes an advanced wet chemical one-step cleaning process which omits the hydrochloric acid/hydrogen peroxide/ water mixture (HPM) step in RCA. A novel one-step cleaning solution had been developed for pregate oxide cleaning to replace the conventional RCA two-step cleaning recipe, which used ammonia/hydrogen peroxide (or SC-1) and HPM (or SC-2) step. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were added into the RCA SC-1 cleaning solution to enhance cleaning efficiency. From the experimental results, the particles and metallic contamination on the bare Si water surface could removed significantly by applying this one-step cleaning solution. The effectiveness of various cleaning recipes and their interaction mechanism with silicon surfaces were studied. The surface adsorption and double layer models could explain the surface behavior of TMAH solutions. Based on the model, the particle, surface roughness and metallic contaminants can be realized. It was observed that the electrical properties of metal oxide semiconductor capacitors after cleaning with this novel solution were better than those after the conventional RCA cleaning.

0031145365	Evaluation of the gas-liquid separation efficiency of a tubular membrane and determination of arsenic species in groundwater by liquid chromatography coupled with hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry	An experimental approach for evaluating the hydride separation efficiency of a tubular microporous poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) membrane by flow injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (HGAAS) is described. A method is also proposed for determining arsenic species in groundwater by coupling ion-pair chromatography (IPC) with HGAAS. The evaluation was undertaken with a combined gas-liquid separator (GLS), consisting of a tubular PTFE membrane and a conventional U-shaped glass device. Two important controlling variables, viz., the length of the microporous PTFE tubing and the ratio of the tubing id to the wall thickness, were investigated. The results showed that the absolute separation efficiency of the PTFE membrane can be effectively evaluated with the combined GLS. In addition, arsenic speciation in groundwater was also investigated by IPC-HGAAS. The chromatographic separation of arsenic species with this analytical system was examined in terms of the effects of pH and concentration of eluent.

23244466879	Electrical detection of protein using gold nanoparticles and nanogap electrodes	A electrical detection of protein is developed in this paper by using self-assembled multilayer gold nanoparticles (AuNP) onto SiO2/Si substrate between gold electrodes. The electrical measurements were performed at room temperature using a probe station. The first monolayer of AuNP is formed by immobilizing AuNP on SiO2 substrate using 3-Aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) molecules. Then, monoclonal antibody is immobilized on the top surface of the first monolayer of AuNP. The second layer of AuNP is formed through specific binding among target antigen (Hepatitis C virus, (HCV)), monoclonal antibody (2B2 by GBC in Taiwan), and conjugate of gold nanoprticle with polycolnal antibody (GP by GBC in Taiwan). The target antigen is sandwiched between monoclonal antibody and conjugate of AuNP-polycolnal antibody. The system relies on gold nanoparticles probes and nano-gap-electrode device with antibodies that specifically binding a protein target of antigen and antibodies that can sandwich the target captured by the nanoparticles probes. As shown in Fig. 1, the average diameter of gold nanoparticles is around 15 nm. A significant difference in IV curves of monolayer and multilayer of AuNP can be used to identify the target antigen in the tested sample. No significant current, which is less than 1 pA, can be measured for the monolayer of AuNP. Once the binding among antigen and antibodies occurs, a peak electrical current can be observed at V ≈ 5.9V.

2542501029	Optical properties of two-dimensional photonic-bandgap crystals characterized by spectral ellipsometry	In this paper, we demonstrate a simple and non-destructive measuring method for both TE and TM bandgaps of two-dimensional (2D) silicon photonic bandgap (PBG) structures by using reflected spectral ellipsometry. Although this method measures the reflected light from samples, the transmitted signal of PBG layer can be measured by using reflecting signals. With large incident angles, planar PBG modulation effects and bandgap information can be obtained. To verify this method, we fabricated silicon arrays for 2D PBG by using electron-beam lithography. From SEM images, we can verify the geometry especially the radius of the cells, which is related to the bandgaps. With a specific set of radii and dielectric constants, we can get the band diagram with plane-wave expansion method. There are several bandgaps of both TE and TM modes, which can be used to detect multiple bandgaps by spectral ellipsometry. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A comparison of the purification efficiencies of hydrogen peroxide and nitric acid was conducted using the gravimetric method and indicated that the former exhibits better at removing defects than the latter. A temperature of 180°C was suitable for the purification of nanotubes without decomposition, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Purification temperatures below 180°C were not effective in removing defects, while temperatures above 180°C decomposed the nanotubes. SEM images provide further evidence for the effectiveness of purification at 180°C. This technique is more efficient, with regard to energy and time, than conventional purification methods. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Between the two types of wafer surfaces evaluated, wafer surfaces with oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and wafer surfaces with nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</ sub>), DEP exhibited a stronger propensity to absorb on the SiO<sub>2</sub> wafers, presumably due to the greater dipole moment between DEP and SiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces.

Subsequently, a series of time-dependent surface DEP concentrations were simulated and validated with the experimental data under various ambient concentrations. Estimation of the allowable wafer exposure durations and the maximum ambient concentrations were exemplified based on the guideline recommended by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS).<sup>1</sup>.

We studied the contrast, sensitivity, etching, and thermal properties of SU-8, PMMA, and KrF resists to evaluate their suitability for the fabrication of oblique structures. Among these resists, SU-8 revealed the lowest contrast ratio, highest throughput, and best thermal stability, and so it became the candidate material for patterning the oblique structures. The technique we have developed involves five regional exposures of a thick SU-8 resist layer with various electron beam dosages. Furthermore, we discuss the surface morphology, reaction mechanism, and hydrophobicity after subjecting the SU-8 resist to a series of plasma treatments. The formation of surface nano-nodules during oxygen plasma treatment explains the surface hydrophobicity.

33646385874	Physical characterization and electrical properties of sol-gel-derived zirconia films	We have developed a simple method for the preparation of ZrO2 ultrathin films; it involves a sequence of ZrCl4 precursor preparation in an ice bath, sol-gel spin-coating processing, baking, and annealing. The film thickness was controllable and tunable by altering the ZrCl4 hexanol ratio. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermal desorption spectrometry indicated that the fabricated ultrathin film was thermally stable at annealing temperatures as high as 900°C. Diffraction patterns of TEM indicated that the films obtained at various annealing temperatures were amorphous. Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) demonstrated an increase in the intensity of the signal for the Zr-O bonds upon increasing the annealing temperature, whereas those for the signals of carbon and chlorine decreased. The ESCA and TEM analyses also suggested that the thickness of the silicon dioxide film increased upon increasing the annealing temperature. The electrical properties, such as the breakdown field (12.5 MVcm) and the gate current density (< 10-7 A cm2), of the sol-gel-derived ZrO2 ultrathin films obtained after annealing at 900°C suggested that they were good electrical insulators.

Two important process parameters, i.e., baking temperatures and substrate types (e.g., bare silicon, polysilicon, oxide, and nitride) were evaluated. Our results indicated that the transition metals (Zn and Mn) have lower migration ratios than alkali metal (Cs) and alkaline earth metal (Ba), irrespective of the substrate types and baking temperatures. The transition metals form stable complexes with the coexisting solvents and/or hydrolysis species in the photoresist layer. The size of the metal complex, the drag force in solvent evaporation, and the baking process were found to have significant effects on impurity migration. A new model, together with the metal migration in the chemically amplified photoresist and the subsequent adsorption onto the underlying substrate, was proposed to explain the pathway of the metal migration. This model could explain the migration ratios of metallic impurities out of the photoresist layer onto the substrate surface. © 2000 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

By keeping the same 4× magnification factor, the dimensions of the structures on masks are becoming comparable to the exposure wavelength or even smaller. The polarization effect induced by mask features is, however, an issue. The introduction of a larger mask magnification should be strongly considered when poor diffraction efficiencies from subwavelength mask features and the resulting image degradation would be encountered in hyper-NA lithography. The dependence of the diffraction efficiencies on mask pitch and illuminating angle are evaluated. The near-field intensity and phase distributions from the mask are calculated. The imaging performance of 4× and 8× masks for the sub-45 nm node are explored.

The chemical structure of photoactive compound is found to be unchanged after modification, while slight change in the polymer chain is observed. The resist layer coated onto the wafer is characterized by various methods including n&k analyzer, Nanospec, Fourier transform infrared red (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to fully evaluate the film properties in terms of porosity, thickness, vibrational spectrum, and thermal stability. Our thermal analysis results show that the resists are mainly decomposed in three stages. The photoactive compound (PAC) is found to decompose during the first stage, while the polymer decomposes during the latter stages. The resist exposure parameters, namely, A, B and C at 365 nm are determined by the absorbance measurement. The extracted parameters are further used in the resist profile simulation by PROLITH/2. It is shown that the spiking of poly(4-vinylphenol) polymer into the resist can improve the resolution and linearity for dense lines. In addition, the swing effects can be reduced by up to 35 and 31% for dense and isolated lines apter resist modification, respectively.

In our radioactive tracer study, it is interestingly found the various amounts of metal and trace element impurities in the lithographic materials may migrate into the substrate. Based on the complex organic matrix in lithographic materials such as bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC), I-line resist and DUV resist, it is not easy to direct determine the multi-elements by the instrumentation. In this work, the lithographic materials are first decomposed by the close-vessel and open-focused microwave oven, and the digest is evaporated to incipient dryness. After adding water, the sample solutions are used either for evaluating the completeness of the digestion process by UV-VIS spectrometer, or for the determination of eleven elements using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In addition, the digestion efficiency is also evaluated by the weight of total dry residual after various digestion recipes. By the complementary digestion method, the method detection limits for analytes can be achieved at lower than ng/g level. For evaluation of data accuracy, the results obtained by the two independent degestion methods are in good agreement. Moreover, the spiking recovery tests for all the elements are of 70 to 130%.

In addition, the spiking copolymer exists in original form. The viscosity of the resist increases with the amount of spiking polymer. Our thermal analysis results show that the resists are mainly decomposed in two regions (280 and 544 °C). The mass loss at 280 °C is significant higher than at 544 °C. The spectra of Fourier transform infrared red (FTIR) spectrometer indicate the extent of carbonate group decomposition decreases with temperature for resists. The plasma etching experiment indicates the promotion of etching resistance of the resist film is due to modification, while the resolution, sensitivity and contrast are not degraded. Owing to the polymer aggregation effect, the stripping performance of the resist film can achieve better after copolymer modification.

Our model successfully explained the substrate effect for bare silicon with lower diffusion ratios as compared with silicon nitride. The coverage of substrate surface with silanol group could be attributed to the formation of native oxide. The effects, including the concentration of surface adsorption metal, the equilibrium constant, the surface concentration of silanol group, the concentration of metallic impurity and the pH value, played very important role on the diffusion ratios for Ba, Cs, Zn and Mn.

The sensitivity, process window and contrast of the modified resist were improved, while the toluene dilution degraded the sensitivity. The electron beam dose affected the designed holes dimension, and the adulterated resist could print sub-50 nm holes pattern. We found the small amount (0.01-0.02% w/v) of fullerene molecules very effectively promoted the etch resistance and selectivity under fluoro-containing gases, and minimized the film stress. The etching resistance for C60 and C70 modification could be improved by 65% and 68%, respectively.

The tantalum oxide nanopyramidal structure was formed as the underlying tantalum film oxidized and localized precisely by the pore of alumina. The reflectance from the spectroscopic measurement suggests that the nanopyramidal array structures have more broadband antireflection (<2%) than the nanodot arrays and thin film structures. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

34247611453	Rigorous electromagnetic simulation of mask magnification effects on the diffracted light for EUV binary mask	Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is expected to be the main candidate in the semiconductor manufacturing starting at 32 nm. As the CD is getting smaller, the aspect ratio of the patterns on the EUV mask is becoming larger. The shadowing effect will become much more significant when keeping the same 4× mask magnification. In this work, mask magnification effects on the diffracted light were explored with rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) for the sub-32 nm node. The simulated binary mask consists of 70-nm TaBN absorber and 2.5-nm Ru capping layer. The dependences of the diffraction efficiencies on mask pitches were calculated. The impacts of the absorber shadowing were observed from the near field distribution on the EUV mask. The aerial images formed by the diffracted light from the 4× and 8× masks were further evaluated. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The nanogap-based electrics chip demonstrates a significant electrical property with a target DNA (TDNA) concentration of 10 pM in the different particle sizes of AuNP to be analyzed in order to make the assay useful for an integrated lab-on-a-chip application system. The biochips with nanogap electrodes are fabricated by e-beam lithography (EBL). Different from traditional detection methods including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on assays which are expensive and time consuming for DNA strands research.

The film started to form the islands at 600 °C annealing, and finally transferred into NCs at 900 °C. A model was proposed to explain the transformation of thin film. The morphology of sol-gel thin film at 600 °C annealing was varied and had higher interfacial energy. The crystallized process at 900 °C annealing could minimize the energy. The retention for 900 °C annealed sample exhibited less than 30% charge loss after 106 s at 125 °C measurement. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

0034294450	Migration-adsorption mechanism of metallic impurities out of chemically amplified photoresist onto silicon-based substrates	The radioactive tracer technique was applied to investigate the migration and adsorption behaviors of metallic impurities (i.e., Ba, Cs, Zn, and Mn) out of chemically amplified photoresist onto silicon-based underlying substrates. Two important process parameters, i.e., baking temperatures and substrate types (e.g., bare silicon, polysilicon, oxide and nitride) were evaluated. Our results indicated that the transition metals (Zn and Mn) have lower migration ratios than alkali metal (Cs) and alkaline earth metal (Ba), irrespective of the substrate types and baking temperatures. The transition metals form stable complexes with the coexisting solvents and/or hydrolysis species in the photoresist layer. The size of the metal complex, the drag force in solvent evaporation, and the baking process were found to have significant effects on impurity migration. A new model, together with the metal migration in the chemically amplified photoresist and the subsequent adsorption onto the underlying substrate, was proposed to explain the pathway of the metal migration. This model could explain the migration ratios of metallic impurities out of the photoresist layer onto the substrate surface.

84867828611	The study of X-ray lithography using the DNQ-novolak type photoresist	As a result of the rapid development of lithography, it enables semiconductor technology to design more devices in the same area, which therefore makes electronic products faster, more functional, and hold more components. The photoresist, playing an important role in lithography, constantly develops with a light wavelength used for exposure from early entire wavelengths to present optical and non-optical lithography. The light sources of optical lithography have moved from the early 436nm and 365nm wavelength to short-wavelength light gradually. It is a big issue to find a suitable photoresist under the exposure of 0.578nm X-Ray light source. In this paper we first proposed to use DNQ / Novolak photoresist sold in the market for the 0.578nm X-Ray lithography. In the experiment, it is discovered that the exposure amount of X-Ray can determine if the photoresist is positive or negative; in low doses, when the photoresist film thickness is increased with the reduced exposure time, and a critical level is reached, the Novolak liquid will become positive photoresist after it is exposed in certain time. The high-dose X-Ray beam will make Novolak resin bond break and result in free radicals, which, through resin crosslinking, can improve the internal strength, and reduce developer solubility so the Novolak liquid can become a negative photoresist. By using synthesized DNQ / Novolak photoresist under X-Ray exposure, we can reduce the process line width, and explore principles of photoresist imaging analysis under the different exposure doses.

84898801727	Studying the enhancement of programmed cell death by combined AG1024 and paclitaxel in a model of chronic myelogenous leukemia	Aims Chronic myelogenous leukemia is a clonal malignancy of the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells that is characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation and expansion of myeloid progenitors. Myeloid progenitors express the fusion oncogene BCR-ABL, which has uncontrollable activity in malignant cells and prevents the cell apoptosis caused by some antineoplastic agents, such as paclitaxel. Targeting these abnormalities by blocking the tyrosine kinase enzymes of BCR-ABL is a promising approach for chronic myelogenous leukemia therapy. Main methods Conventional Liu's staining is an auxiliary technique used in microscopy to enhance the contrast in microscopic images, aiding the observation of cell morphology. The MTT assay, flow cytometry of the sub-G1 analysis and the TUNEL assay were applied to estimate the apoptosis levels. RT-PCR and western blot methods were used to evaluate the key molecules conferring anti-cell-death properties. Key findings The effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1024 were evaluated with regard to the regulation of BCR-ABL expression, inhibition of cell proliferation, and enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in BCR-ABL-expressing K562 cell lines. AG1024 downregulated the expression of BCR-ABL and anti-apoptosis factors, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which were present in K562 cells. Moreover, the combination of AG1024 with paclitaxel inhibited cell proliferation and enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis within 24 h. Significance In summary, the present study shows that the combination of AG1024 with paclitaxel inhibited model cancer cell proliferation, suggesting a new use of paclitaxel-based chemotherapy for cancer control. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

43349105631	Stress-induced morphology and fine-line stability enhancement of NiSi on poly-SiGe with a buffer polycrystalline silicon interlayer	The thermal and morphological stability of NiSi is enhanced by inserting a polycrystalline (poly-Si) buffer layer between the Ni and poly-SiGe films. NiSi films formed on poly-Si/poly-SiGe stack layers possessed continuous, smooth structures after annealing at 500-850 °C. Moreover, nickel germanosilicide [Ni(Si, Ge)] lines formed on the poly-SiGe exhibited a fine-line effect, i.e., the sheet resistance increased upon decreasing the linewidth, whereas the sheet resistance of NiSi lines formed on the poly-Si/poly-SiGe stack layers remained less than 5 square. A model for the stress-confined grain growth and recrystallization is proposed to explain the improved properties of the poly-Si-buffered film. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

We added these surfactants together with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) into the RCA SC-1 cleaning solution to enhance the efficiency of cleaning. With the exception of the TBAH solution, the cleaning efficiency of these solutions toward particles was 4%-7% higher than that of the conventional RCA method.

4444335085	Room temperature operation of a coulomb blockade sensor fabricated by self-assembled gold nanoparticles using deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization	Molecules of 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane react with gold nanoparticles to form a gold monolayer on a silicon dioxide substrate. The 12-mer capture Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) self-assembles with the nanometer-sized gold particles. Prior to DNA hybridization, a capture DNA produced via hybridization of the target and probe oligonucleotides is covalently bonded to the gold particles. In addition, the probe oligonucleotide containing a thiol group can self-assemble with additional gold nanoparticles, and multilayered structures are thereby fabricated. The device, assembled only with gold nanoparticles and without DNA immobilization, has no quantum effect conductivity, while a DNA sensor assembled from 4nm gold nanoparticles and oligonucleotides exhibits Coulomb blockade. The measurement of the tunneling current as a function of applied voltage for the Coulomb blockade DNA sensor is reproducible. Using 14 nm gold nanoparticles instead, the Coulomb blockade for the DNA sensor only occurs at temperatures below 150 K.

46749104465	Application of physical vapor deposition process to modify activated carbon fibers for ozone reduction	This study utilized the activated carbon fiber (ACF) modified with metal catalyst via physical vapor deposition (PVD) process (ACF/PVD) to diminish ozone. Furthermore, the ozone removal efficiency of ACF/PVD was compared with that of original ACF and ACF modified with metal catalyst via impregnation process (ACF/impregnation). In addition to the kinds of coated metal and the inlet ozone concentrations, the effects of the coating thickness and the reaction temperature on ACF/PVD for ozone removal were also examined. The results indicate that the ozone removal efficiency of ACF/PVD is better than that of original ACF and ACF/impregnation. The ozone removal efficiency of different metal-coated ACF/PVD in the superior order is gold (Au), and manganese (Mn). The increase of Au-coated thickness (3 nm to 80 nm) on ACF/PVD will enhance the ozone removal. However, when the Mn-coated thickness on ACF/PVD is larger than 15 nm, the ozone removal efficiency displays a declining trend. Furthermore, a higher reaction temperature will result in a better ozone removal of ACF/PVD and the original ACF. © 2008 Springer.

49649093183	Self-assembly behavior of A-B diblock and C-D random copolymer mixtures in the solution state through mediated hydrogen bonding	We have synthesized poly(methyl methacrylate-b-4-vinylpyridine) (PMMA-MMVP) and poly(styrene-r-vinylphenol) (PS-r-PVPh) copolymers by using anionic and free radical polymerizations, respectively. Well-defined micelles through hydrogen bonding have been prepared by mixing PMMA-b-P4VP diblock copolymer and PS-r-PVPh random copolymer in a single solvent. Block copolymers were mixed with random copolymers, with various [N]/[OH] ratios (4/1, 2/1, 1/1, and 1/4) in which "[N]/[OH]" represents the molar ratio of pyridine groups on P4VP to hydroxyl groups on PVPh. The presence distribution of PVPh/P4VP and PVPh/PMMA hydrogen bonding depends on the feeding ratio of PVPh to P4VP. When the PVPh content is lower than that of P4VP, hydrogen bonding occurs only between PVPh and P4VP; with excess PVPh, additional hydrogen bonding between PVPh and PMMA would occur. Furthermore, the effect of the solvent quality on the self-assembly behavior of PMMA-b-P4VP/PS-r-PVPh blends is investigated by considering tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dimethylformamide (DMF) as common solvents. We can mediate the strength of hydrogen bonding in blend systems by adopting different solvents and inducing different morphology transitions. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

The conductance amplification between single strand and hybridized DNAs through gold nanoparticles is observed. Various concentrations of capture and target DNA are discussed for optimal hybridization sensing purpose. With the help of 1 nM capture DNAs, this sensor is able to analyze target DNA sequences at very low concentration of 1 fM. Furthermore, by means of adjusting the denature temperature to 60 °C, even single mismatch hybridization could be discriminated. © 2008 American Vacuum Society.

POSS-C11-Cz exhibits good thermal and electrochemical stabilities and good film-forming properties. The optical and photoluminescence spectra of POSS-C11-Cz in solution and in the solid state indicate a reduction in the degrees of aggregation and excimer formation because inter-chain interactions were prohibited by the bulky POSS core. Moreover, photoluminescence spectra of a POSS-C11-Cz (3 wt.%)/polyfluorene (97 wt.%) blend revealed that the color was stable after heating the sample at 200 °C for 5 h; in contrast, the pure polyfluorene exhibited a significant green emission at 530 nm. A triple-layer device based on this blend exhibited higher maximum brightness and luminance efficiencies relative to those of the pure polyfluorene. Thus, the organic/inorganic POSS-C11-Cz/polyfluorene blend has potential for use in polymeric light-emitting diodes because of its improved thermal and optoelectronic characteristics.

Functionalized poly-crystalline silicon nanowire field-effect transistor (poly-SiNW FET) was demonstrated to achieve specific and ultrasensitive (at fM level) detection of high pathogenic strain virus (H5 and H7) DNA of avian influenza (AI) which is an important infectious disease and has an immediate need for surveillance. The poly-SiNW FET was prepared by a simple and low-cost method that is compatible with current commercial semiconductor process without expensive E-beam lithography tools for large-scale production. Specific electric changes were observed for AI virus DNA sensing when nanowire surface of poly-SiNW FET was modified with complementary captured DNA probe and target DNA (H5) at fM to pM range could be distinguished. With its excellent electric properties and potential for mass commercial production, poly-SiNW FET can be developed to become a portable biosensor for field use and point-of-care diagnoses. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

70349983593	A nanodot array modulates cell adhesion and induces an apoptosis-like abnormality in NIH-3T3 cells	Micro-structures that mimic the extracellular substratum promote cell growth and differentiation, while the cellular reaction to a nanostructure is poorly defined. To evaluate the cellular response to a nanoscaled surface, NIH 3T3 cells were grown on nanodot arrays with dot diameters ranging from 10 to 200 nm. The nanodot arrays were fabricated by AAO processing on TaN-coated wafers. A thin layer of platinum, 5 nm in thickness, was sputtered onto the structure to improve biocompatibility. The cells grew normally on the 10-nm array and on flat surfaces. However, 50-nm, 100-nm, and 200-nm nanodot arrays induced apoptosis-like events. Abnormality was triggered after as few as 24 h of incubation on a 200-nm dot array. For cells grown on the 50-nm array, the abnormality started after 72 h of incubation. The number of filopodia extended from the cell bodies was lower for the abnormal cells. Immunostaining using antibodies against vinculin and actin filament was performed. Both the number of focal adhesions and the amount of cytoskeleton were decreased in cells grown on the 100-nm and 200-nm arrays. Pre-coatings of fibronectin (FN) or type I collagen promoted cellular anchorage and prevented the nanotopography-induced programed cell death. In summary, nanotopography, in the form of nanodot arrays, induced an apoptosis-like abnormality for cultured NIH 3T3 cells. The occurrence of the abnormality was mediated by the formation of focal adhesions. © to the authors 2009.

0034757243	Studies of chemically amplified deep UV resists for electron beam lithography applications	Chemically amplified resists have been widely used in deep UV optical lithography. In this paper, we characterized positive deep UV resists for high-resolution electron beam lithography applications. Results indicate this deep UV resist is very high sensitive and suitable for high throughput e-beam lithography applications. In general, deep UV resists are not suitable for sub-100 nm resolution lithography, except for strictly process control. After a simple thermal flow procedure, the trench-width can be easily down to 70 nm. It is also convenient to get a sub-70 nm contact hole pattern by utilizing commercial deep UV resists with this strategy. Many factors influence performance of resists such as soft bake, post exposure bake, exposure dose, and thermal flow, which are discussed and optimized. Suitable dry etching properties of deep UV resists are also characterized for pattern transfer.

0034768320	Process development and impurities analysis for the bottom antireflective coating material	The optical behaviour of semiconductor bottom antireflective coating (BARC) material was investigated by both the measurement and simulation methods. The effects of spin-coating rate, interface refection, BARC layer thickness and photoresist layer thickness were studied. Our results indicated that the 62.5 nm of BARC layer had strong effect on suppressing the light reflection of wavelength of 248 nm from the wafer surface, irrespective of the photoresist layer thickness. Based on the gravimetric method, a high throughput and one-step microwave digestion procedure was developed for the BARC materials. The digestion efficiency increased with the digestion duration and the temperature. By following the established one-step microwave digestion method and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry determination, the detection limits obtained for Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb were in 0.1 to 1.11 ppb levels. The spike recoveries of the metallic impurities were in the range 86-102% for the BARC materials. The analytical results of the BARC samples were found to be in reasonably good agreement with our previous method, and the analytical throughput can achieve up to 20 samples per hour for the analysis of 5 elements.

0035122417	Characterization and modeling of the metal diffusion from deep ultraviolet photoresist and silicon-based substrate	The radioactive tracer technique was applied to investigate the out-diffusion of the transition metals (Cu, Fe and Co) from deep ultraviolet (DUV) photoresist into underlying substrate. Two important process parameters, viz., baking temperatures and substrate types (i.e., bare silicon, polysilicon, silicon oxide and silicon nitride), were evaluated. Results indicate that the out-diffusion of Co is insignificant, irrespective of the substrate type and baking temperature. The out-diffusion of Cu is significant for substrates of bare silicon and polysilicon but not for silicon oxide and nitride; for Fe, the story is reversed. The substrate type appears to strongly affect the diffusion, while the baking temperature does not. Also, the effect of solvent evaporation was found to play an important role in impurity diffusion. Using the method of numerical analysis, a diffusion profile was depicted in this work to describe the out-diffusion of metallic impurities from photoresist layer under various baking conditions. In addition, the effectiveness of various wet-cleaning recipes in removing metallic impurities such as Cu, Fe and Co was also studied using the radioactive tracer technique. Among the six cleaning solutions studied, SC2 and SPM are the most effective in impurity removal. An out-diffusion cleaning model was first proposed to describe the cleaning process. A new cleaning coefficient, h(T), was suggested to explain the cleaning effect. The cleaning model could explain the tracer results. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0035179977	A Fabry-Perot type anti-reflective coating for deep ultraviolet binary photomask application	In this paper, we demonstrated a novel anti-reflective coating structure for deep ultraviolet binary mask, which is based on three-layer Fabry-Perot structure. The anti-reflective coating structure is composed of the chrome/oxide/chrome stack. By adding different optimized structures, reflectance of less than 2% at both 248 nm and 193 nm have been achieved. The results are also agreed well with simulated ones. At the three-layer Fabry-Perot structure, the thickness of bottom chrome layer should be larger than 100 nm to provide suitable absorption. By controlling the thickness of the intermediate oxide layer, we can tune the minimum reflection regime to the desired exposure wavelength. The thickness of top chrome layer should be well controlled in order to optimize transmission light into Fabry-Perot structures. In general, the mask layer should have good electrical conductivity for e-beam writing in order to prevent writing errors due to charging effects. In the Fabry-Perot structure, the top metal layer can also prevent charge accumulation during e-beam writing.

Nanoparticles can be regarded as a hybrid between small molecule and bulk material. A material on the nanoscale produces considerable changes on various properties, making them size- and shape-dependent. Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), one of the wide variety of core materials available, coupled with tunable surface properties in the form of inorganic or inorganic-organic hybrid have been reported as an excellent platform for a broad range of analytical methods. This review aims to introduce the basic principles, examples, and descriptions of methods for the characterization of Au NPs by using chromatography, electrophoresis, and self-assembly strategies for separation science. Some of the latest important applications of using Au NPs as stationary phases toward open-tubular capillary electrochromatography, gas chromatography, and liquid chromatography as well as roles of run buffer additive to enhance separation and preconcentration in the field of chromatographic, electrophoretic and in chip-based systems are reviewed. Additionally, we review Au NPs-assisted state-of-the-art techniques involving the use of micellar electrokinetic chromatography, an online diode array detector, solid-phase extraction, and mass spectrometry for the preconcentration of some chemical compounds and biomolecules. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

The antireflective layers are composed of a low dielectric constant FLARE 2.0 film and its etching hard mask layer, such as oxide or nitride. By adding an optimized thin oxide or nitride layer, the reflectance of less than 1% at resist / silicon substrate interface can be achieved. The swing effect in the resist is also shown significantly reduced. It also has a great potential to be used as BARC layer on other highly reflectance substrate such as copper, aluminum, tungsten, titanium nitride, and tantalum nitride, which are commonly used in metal interconnect. Since it is easy to reduce reflectance by adding a FLARE film and its etching hard mask layer without adding an extra BARC layer. It is convenient to use this structure for patterning low dielectric materials in ArF lithography. Suitable etching characteristics and thermal stability of FLARE 2.0 based BARC layers are also shown in this paper.

0036010485	Direct impurity analysis of semiconductor photoresist samples with laser ablation ICP-MS	A high-throughput method involving laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was developed for the determination of critical elements in semiconductor photoresist samples. An innovative procedure, including a sequence of spiking, mixing, spin-coating, and baking, was developed for the preparation of photoresist film standards to be used for calibration in the direct analytical process. The homogeneity of the photoresist sample was then evaluated using the radiotracer technique, and the effects of silicon substrate reflection, spin rate and baking temperature on the signal response of the analytes in the photoresist film were subsequently studied. The results indicated that sample pretreatment conditions (i.e., spin rate and baking temperature) strongly influenced the signal intensity. The signal variations with respect to photoresist thickness, due to the changes in spin rate, could be corrected by using an internal standard, while those due to the changes in baking temperature could not. Visual evidence of shock-wave motion, via a laser induced plasma, on the photoresist film was presented in the SEM images using a Nd-YAG laser in the Q-switched mode. For direct determination of impurities in photoresist samples, various calibration methods, including a matrix-matched external calibration curve, an internal standard with the major matrix element (i.e., carbon), and an internal standard with metal spiking (i.e., Co and Tl), were evaluated independently. The recoveries of spike metals (Al, Cu, Pt, Au, Th and U) ranged from 81 to 112%, with detection limits in the 20-285 ng mL

We could explain the surface behavior of various cleaning solutions by the different molecular size and charge of chelating agents. Based on the mechanism, the behavior of surface particle and metallic impurity can be realized.

In general, deep UV resists are not suitable for resolving sub-100 nm problems except for the case of strict process control. We demonstrated thermal flow and chemical shrink techniques for sub-100 nm contact hole fabrication in electron beam lithography. The 200 nm contact hole resist patterns could easily be shrunk to less than 80 nm after a simple thermal flow procedure on a hot plate. The effects of thermal flow temperature and time period were evaluated. For the chemical shrink method, critical parameters of greatest influence, such as mixing bake temperature, baking time and initial hole size were discussed. After suitable chemical shrink, a hole dimension of 75 nm was obtained.

0036614577	Low dielectric constant polymer materials as bottom antireflective coating layers for both KrF and ArF lithography	In this paper, we demonstrate a new bottom antireflective coating (BARC) layer for both KrF and ArF lithography. The antireflective layers are composed of a novel low-dielectric constant polymer material (SiLK) and its etching hard-mask layer. By adding an optimized hard-mask layer, the reflectance of less than 1% at the resist/silicon substrate interface can be achieved. SiLK also has great potential to be used as BARC layers on various highly-reflectance substrates for metal-interconnect applications with large thickness-controlled tolerance. By using this novel structure, it is easy to reduce reflectance without adding an extra BARC layer for patterning low-dielectric materials. In this paper, suitable etching characteristics and thermal stability of SiLK-based BARC layers are also described.

The antireflective coating structure is composed of a metal-oxide-metal stack. By addition of different optimized structures, reflectances of less than 1.5% at both 248 and 193 nm have been achieved. At the three-layer Fabry-Perot structure, the bottom chrome layer provides suitable absorption. By controlling the thickness of the intermediate silicon oxide layer, we can tune the minimum-reflection regime to the desired exposure wavelength.

Therefore, three poly(N-phenyl methacrylamide)s, poly(N-phenyl methacrylamide) (PNPAA), poly(N-4-methoxyphenyl methacrylamide) (PMPMA) and poly(N-4-bromophenyl methacrylamide) (PBPMA), with different inductive substitution at para position of benzene ring are prepared to investigate the substituent-induced delocalization effects on the hydrogen-bonding interaction behaviors. In this study, the variable-temperature FTIR spectrum is used as tool to study the self- and inter-association hydrogen-bonding interaction.

80455173666	Prostate cancer marker sensing under nanostructural biochip technique	A silicon nanobelt field effect transistor (SiNBFET) device was proposed as an alternating platform of ultrasensitive biosensor, and apply to the label-free detection and early diagnosis of the prostate specific antigen (PSA). The designed SiNB-FET molecule sensor demonstrated real-time, label-free, and high-selective properties in detecting biomolecules. The novel back-gate SiNB-FET was fabricated by using the state-of-the-art complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing technology. The shrank nanobelt structure with high surface-to-volume ratio and individual back-gate controlling was achieved by the local-oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) process. The probe molecule was sequentially immobilized onto the device surface for the purpose of target molecule sensing. Those molecules bearing with charge characteristics significantly influenced the charge carrier in the device channel. Hence, the target PSA can be easily detected from the shift of device's electrical property. In this research, the operating condition of device's gate controlling voltage was carefully studied. In addition, the molecular amplification method was developed to enhance the method's sensitivity. Finally, real samples from the hospital site were evaluated to characterize the concentration. We have demonstrated the detection capability of PSA by the SiNB-FET, and results show that the nanobelt biochip will be applied to the clinical diagnosis, and verify its feasibility on the ultrasensitive diagnosis of prostate cancer in the future. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

We probed the digestion reaction by measuring the response of the detectable species - we detected a total of 20 volatile organic compounds - with respect to the temperature over the range from room temperature to 80°C. These compounds can be classified into alkane, alkanol, and aromatic species. The alkane species decreased monotonically, whereas the alkanol and aromatic compounds first increased and then decreased, as the digestion temperature increased. We have established the degradation mechanisms, which involve bond scission, recombination, adduct formation, and ring opening, on the basis of product analyses and bond length simulations. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

84862729239	Surface effect of assembling enzyme and modulation of surface enzyme activity with electric potential stress	The fluorescent marker of rhodamine B amine is successfully used to evaluate the immobilization capability onto silicon-based patterns fabricated by semiconductor manufacturing. Only the silicon dioxide surface, by means of fluorescent observation, can immobilize the rhodamine molecule by the sequential linkage of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and glutaraldehyde. The phenol sulfotransferase enzyme is also successfully immobilized onto the silicon dioxide surface by the linking molecules of APTES and sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohezane-1-carboxylate in the home-made apparatus. The enzyme activity of the sulfotransferase is determined from the absorbance of 4-nitrophenol at 400 nm wavelength. The surface immobilized enzyme remains its activity for catalytic reaction at least 120-min duration. The surface saturation effect on the activity of immobilized enzyme is explained and ascribed to the surface diffusion effect of electric double layers. We can success control the surface immobilized enzyme by electric potential stress. The activity of enzyme is reduced under negative potential, while is enhanced under positive potential. The electric potential can induce the enzyme structure variation and modulate the enzyme activity due to the electrostatic effect. © 2012 by ESG.

84862735148	Label-free detection of prostate specific antigen using a silicon nanobelt field-effect transistor	In this study, we proposed a silicon nanobelt field-effect transistor (FET) to detect prostate specific antigen (PSA). The nanobelt FET device displayed n-channel depletion characteristics. The immobilization of prostate specific antibody (anti-PSA) molecules was attached onto the nanobelt FET surface by using the aldehyde groups of glutaraldehyde linked to the amino groups of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). The shift in the drain current vs time curves of a nanobelt FET biosensor revealed that the electrical signal had a logarithmic relationship with respect to the concentration of the PSA, and detection capability was estimated in the 5 pg/mL level. To enhance the sensitivity of a nanobelt FET biosensor, this biosensor was designed by inserting arginine molecules between glutaraldehyde and APTES. Therefore, the detection capability of the developed sensor was extended to 50 fg/mL. Also, the relationship between the current shift and the logarithm of PSA concentration was exhibited linearity in the range 50 fg/mL - 500 pg/mL. The excellent electrical results of this label-free PSA nanobelt FET biosensor suggested that such biosensor might be potentially useful tools for biological research and future prostate cancer screening. © 2012 by ESG.

We mixed the MWCNTs with saturated silver nitrate/nitric acid solution, without adding a reductant or stabilizer, and then heated them in the closed microwave heating system.

These star PNIPAm-b-POSS copolymers undergo a sharp coil-globule transition in water at above 32C changing from a hydrophilic state below this temperature to a hydrophobic state above it, which is similar to linear PNIPAm homopolymers. More interestingly, we found that these star polymers exhibited strong blue photoluminescence in water above a lower critical solution temperature (LCST). This photoluminescence was likely due to the constrained geometric freedom and relatively rigid structure caused by intramolecular hydrogen bonding within the star PNIPAm polymers, which exhibit an intrinsic fluorescent behavior.

84864187176	Broadband and wide angle antireflection of sub-20 nm GaAs nanograss	GaAs nanograss with diameters of less than 20 nm has been fabricated using a simple, one-step, maskless plasma etching-based approach. GaAs nanograss exhibits remarkable broadband antireflection properties, which arise from the graded refractive index between air and the GaAs substrate by the nanograss layer. Moreover, GaAs nanograss shows less sensitivity to transverse electric polarized light and transverse magnetic polarized light over a wide range of incident angles compared to the strong variation in a bare GaAs substrate. These effects show that sub-20 nm GaAs nanograss with lengths of approximately 200 nm has an enhanced absorption of 98-100% when the incident energy is larger than the GaAs bandgap (λ = 240-873 nm) and an enhanced absorption of 72-98% when the incident energy is less than the bandgap (λ = 873-2400 nm). Our simple, one-step, and maskless plasma etching method opens a promising approach for the direct implementation of broad omnidirectional antireflective surfaces on solar cells and various optoelectronic devices to improve device performance. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Moving and splitting the atmospheric-pressure microplasma in different gas bubbles were achieved by DEP.

84865217751	Liquid lenses and driving mechanisms: A review	In this paper, we discuss liquid lenses driven by various mechanisms. By properly designing the device structure and choosing the optimal materials, the liquid lenses offer great potential for practical uses. The driving mechanism dictates the application and performance of the liquid lenses. Here we categorize the driving mechanisms into mechanical and electrical ones. In general, mechanical driving with an elastic membrane and an external pump drives liquids in a cavity by controlling the hydraulic pressure. The mechanical driving method can be applied to most of the liquids, but the application of the electrical driving method would be limited by the conductivity or the permittivity of the liquids. Therefore, the properties of the different liquids, e.g., dielectric liquids, liquid crystal molecules, and conductive liquids, deeply affect the mechanism we may choose to realize a liquid lens. Among various electrical methods, dielectrophoresis (DEP), electrostatic forces, and electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) are emphasized here for driving dielectric liquids, liquid crystal molecules, and conductive liquids, respectively. DEP deforms the liquid lenses when the permittivities are different between the liquid and the medium. Electrostatic force orients the liquid crystal molecules to follow the applied electric field. Electrowetting-driven liquid lenses change their focal lengths by altering the contact angle. Here we show the designs and the structures of liquid lenses to describe their mechanisms, performances and feasibilities. It is worth mentioning that the liquid lenses using electrowetting have been commercialized. No moving parts would be the most important reason to use electrical manipulations rather than mechanical ones. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

We firstly fabricated a multi-layer thin film with electrodes as a thermal device that could adjust the surface temperature by applying voltage. We sequentially used very-large-scale integration (VLSI) process and atom-transfer radical-polymerization (ATRP) process to generate well-defined pillar patterns of polymerized styrene as seta analogues and successively grafted n-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) as thermally responsive terminating of the pillars to mimic the configuration of a real gecko's foot pad. Our fabrication strategy exploits surface textures of polystyrene (PS) and thermally responsive terminating of PNIPAAm, which could generate alternately ca. 88.1 and 11.3 nN of adhesive force at 0.2 and 2 V of applying voltage, respectively. The results indicate that the adjustable adhesive ability of the copolymer brushes could approach the climbing aptitude of a gecko much more closely through voltage tuning.

Through a refinery process called transesterification. Biodiesel has been demonstrated produced by transesterification reaction by the addition of enzyme, i.e. Candida rugosa lipase [1]. In this study, we self-assemble lipase on the gold film through surface modifications. Under the gold film, a PN photodetector is pre-fabricated, and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is used as a fluid channel and reaction chamber of transesterification process. Since PDMS reactor is optically transmittance, a specific wavelength of light can be used to detect transesterification reaction. The monitor for biodiesel production can be detected by means of transmittance (T %) taken as an indicator to estimate the conversion yield of the transesterification reaction. In this study, the on-chip PN diode is used as a photo detector to detect the conversion of biodiesel. As a result, the lipase-catalyzed immobilized on the Au/PN diode and a micro-fluidic device as a transesterification reaction chamber is proposed for real-time monitoring through transmittance characterization. © 2012 by ESG.

When compared with commercial semiconductor processes, the sidewall spacer technique has the advantages of simplicity and low cost. In this study, we employed a novel poly-Si NWFET device for real-time, label-free, and ultrahigh-sensitivity detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in human serum. Since serum proteome is very complex containing high levels of salts and other interfering compounds, we hereby developed a standard operating procedure for real-sample pretreatment to keep a proper pH value and ionic strength of the desalted serum and also utilized Tween 20 to serve as the passivation agent by surface modification on the NWFET to reduce nonspecific binding for medical diagnostic applications. We first modified 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane on the surface of a poly-Si nanowire device followed by glutaraldehyde functionalization, and the PSA antibodies were immobilized on the aldehyde terminal. While PSA was prepared in the buffers to maintain an appropriate pH value and ionic strength, the results indicated that the sensor could detect trace PSA at less than 5 fg/mL in a microfluidic channel.

In this paper, a new series of uracil-functionalized poly(ε-caprolactone)-b-(4-vinylbenzyl uracil)s (PCL-b-PVBU) have been prepared which exhibit a high self-complementary ability in solution and solid states owing to the formation of uracil-uracil pairs by induced hierarchical self-assembly. The ordered morphologies of PCL-b-PVBU diblock copolymers changed from a lamellar, hexagonally packed cylinder to a sphere with respect to the content of the hydrogen bond segment. Moreover, we further show that the PCL segment could be easily extracted by enzymatic degradation, leading to a cylinder porous structure of long-range order, which gives a facile method for the fabrication of uracil-functionalized nanotemplates. In addition, bio-complementary PCL-b-PVBU/9-hexadecyladenine (AC16) hierarchical supramolecular complexes formed through strong cooperative hydrogen bonding between the uracil group of PVBU and the adenine group of A-C16. When the mixing ratios of PCL-b-PVBU/AC16 differ from the stoichiometric ratio, these complexes self-assemble into well-ordered lamellar and hexagonal structures; the changing morphology at different AC16 loadings reveals that the molecular structures of the PCL-b-PVBU/AC16 complexes are readily tailored. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

0345550265	In-channel dual-electrode amperometric detection in electrophoretic chips with a palladium film decoupler	An electrophoretic microchip integrated with a Pd-film decoupler and a series-dual electrode was proven practical (200-800V/cm) for routine amperometric detection. In fluidic systems, amperometric enhancement of parallel-opposed dual-electrode detection is due to redox cycling of analytes between the electrodes. We, however, found that the oxidation current of catecholamines was enhanced significantly (1.9-3.8 folds) by switching from the single electrode mode to dual-series mode. This novel finding was unexpected because the unidirectional flow characteristic of the microfluidic system should eliminate the possibility for analytes physically migrating back and forth between the upstream and downstream electrodes. We attribute the enhancement to turbulence generated by impinging of the flow onto the edge of the downstream electrode. The linear range, sensitivity, limit of detection (S/N=3) and number of theoretical plates for DA and CA are, respectively, 0.5-50μM, 47pA/μM, 0.25μM, 7000m

0242691240	Microwave rapid heating for the synthesis of gold nanorods	A microwave heating system with a sealed reaction chamber and a precise temperature-controlled module was employed to assess the synthesis of tetradecylammonium bromide (TOAB) cation surfactant-stabilized gold nanorods. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to characterize the size and the shape of particles. It was found that both TOAB concentrations and reaction temperature programs played an important role in the formation of gold nanorods. By using higher TOAB concentration and faster rising reaction temperature, gold nanorods with higher aspect ratio could be produced. This finding demonstrated the combination of TOAB surfactant and microwave system to be a useful approach for the preparation of gold nanorods. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84899558310	Polystyrene-block-poly(methylmethacrylate) composite material film as a gate dielectric for plastic thin-film transistor applications	We report a simple approach to fabricate an organic-inorganic hybrid gate insulator based n-type thin-film transistor (TFT) on a plastic polyimide (PI) sheet at room temperature using an appropriate composition of commercially available polymers and block copolymer surfactant. The composite material film namely; polystyrene-block-poly(methylmethacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) is readily deposited as a gate dielectric with zinc oxide (ZnO) as a semiconductor layer. This new dielectric material film exhibits high surface energy, high air stability, very low leakage current density and better dielectric constant as compared to the conventional polymer dielectrics. This plastic ZnO-TFT combines the advantages of a high-mobility transparent inorganic semiconductor with an ultrathin high-capacitance and low-leakage PS-b-PMMA composite gate dielectric. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum analysis is used for the PS-b-PMMA film to confirm the presence of functional components in this composite material film. The contact angle measurements for three test liquids (e.g., distilled water, ethylene glycol and diiodomethane) reveal that the composite dielectric materials film is nearly hydrophobic and the calculated surface energy is 35.05 mJ m

84903291668	Aptamer based surface enhanced Raman scattering detection of adenosine using various core sizes of Au-Ag core-shell nanoparticles	The present study synthesizes different sizes of Au nanoparticles (NPs) by adjusting the concentration of citrate. This method produces Au NPs with uniform sizes that can be used to grow Au-Ag core-shell NPs by the seeding growth method. We report the fabrication of monolayer Au NPs or Au-Ag core-shell NPs through the self-assembly of NPs on a 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS)-modified silicon substrate. The results indicate that the self-assembly time of Au NPs or Au-Ag core-shell NPs plays a crucial role in determining the surface coverage of NPs on the silicon substrate. The appropriate sizes of Au NPs or Au-Ag core-shell NPs were optimized to yield the greatest SERS effect in the rhodamine B molecule. The substrates with self-assembled Au-Ag core-shell NPs can also be used to detect adenosine by a structure-switch aptamer. The combination of Au-Ag core-shell NPs and DNA-based adenosine sensors provides a facile, high enhancement, low detection limit (0.1 nM) and low cost fabrication, which shall be of significant value for practical applications of other aptamer sensing systems. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

84904869452	A two-step electrical degradation behavior in α-InGaZnO thin-film transistor	In this study, we explored the threshold voltage instability behavior in amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide (α-IGZO) thin-film transistor (TFT). A tow-step electrical degradation behavior of α-IGZO TFT was found under gate-bias stress. A usual small positive shift followed by a special negative shift of threshold voltage is characterized in the α-IGZO TFT. We suggest that the positive shift of the threshold voltage is because of charge trapping in the gate dielectric and/or at the channel/dielectric interface, while the negative shift of threshold voltage may be attributed to electric field induced extra electron carriers from H

84905170759	Broadband antireflection and field emission properties of TiN-coated Si-nanopillars	Broadband antireflection and field emission characteristics of silicon nanopillars (Si-NPs) fabricated by self-masking dry etching in hydrogen-containing plasma were systematically investigated. In particular, the effects of ultrathin (5-20 nm) titanium nitride (TiN) films deposited on Si-NPs by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on the optoelectronic properties were explored. The results showed that by coating the Si-NPs with a thin layer of TiN the antireflection capability of pristine Si-NPs can be significantly improved, especially in the wavelength range of 1000-1500 nm. The enhanced field emission characteristics of these TiN/Si-NP heterostructures suggest that, in addition to the reflectance suppression in the long wavelength range arising from the strong wavelength-dependent refractive index of TiN, the TiN-coating may have also significantly modified the effective work function at the TiN/Si interface as well. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

0347931848	Synthesis of gold/poly(methyl methacrylate) hybrid nanocomposites	This paper presents a method for the preparation of spherical gold/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) hybrid nanocomposites. Analysis of data from both transmission electron microscopy images and Fourier transfer infrared spectra confirm the formation of hybrid composites in which large numbers of gold nanoparticles are dispersed throughout the PMMA matrix. The diameters and dispersions of the gold nanoparticles are controlled by the polymer concentration. Gold/PMMA nano-ball composites are formed at concentrations of the polymer of ca. 35μM (ca. 5.25mM with respect to the repeating MMA units). In the absence of the polymer, most of the gold particles undergo macroscopic precipitation, which indicates that the PMMA polymer is essential for stabilizing the gold particles. In addition, we found that the glass-transition temperature (T

10644257693	Studying the size/shape separation and optical properties of silver nanoparticles by capillary electrophoresis	This paper describes the feasibility of employing capillary electrophoresis (CE) to separate silver particles in nanometer regimes. We have found that the addition of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), to the running electrolyte prevents coalescence of the silver particles during the process, which improves the separation performance; the concentration of SDS required for optimal silver nanoparticle separation is ca. 20 mM. By monitoring the electropherograms using a diode-array detection (DAD) system, we have also investigated the separation of suspended silver nanorods with respect to their shapes. Our results demonstrate that the combination of CE and DAD is a powerful one for the separation and characterization of various silver nanoparticles. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The procedure we describe is one in which a silver salt is reduced to silver metal by the action of sodium citrate in the presence of gold seeds. We have characterized the silver products by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray diffractometry, and electron diffraction. The key requirement for producing the silver nanorods in a high aspect ratio is an adequate MW heating time. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

13244255813	High reflectance of reflective-type attenuated-phase-shifting masks for extreme ultraviolet lithography with high inspection contrast in deep ultraviolet regimes	Phase-shifting masks are a vital resolution enhance technique that will be used in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography beyond the 20 nm node. In this article, we demonstrate a structure for a reflective-type attenuated phase-shifting mask, which is based on a Fabry-Perot structure with common materials in EUV masks. The mask structure not only performs 180° phase shift with high reflectance at EUV wavelength, but also has high inspection contrast at deep ultraviolet (DUV) wavelength. The top layer of mask structures exhibits good conductivity, which can alleviate the charging effect during electron-beam patterning. The reflectance ratio of the absorber stack could be tuned from 32.6% (TaN/SiO

13244261150	Effect of fluoroalkyl substituents on the reactions of alkylchlorosilanes with mold surfaces for nanoimprint lithography	We have applied trichloro(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)silane (FPTS) and trichloro(1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (FOTS) for the preparation of self-assembled film on a silicon mold for use as releasing, antisticking layers for nanoimprint lithography. From contact angle measurements, we have determined the surface energies of the molds in terms of their Lewis acid, Lewis base, and van der Waals components. The surface energies of the FPTS- and FOTS-derived film decreased as the annealing temperature and immersion time increased. Suitable self-assembled films were prepared by annealing at 150°C for at least 1 h. The surface roughnesses of the self-assembled film formed from FPTS and FOTS were 0.468 and 0.189 nm, respectively. The lower surface energy and roughness of the FOTS-derived film on the silicon mold prevent both the adhesion and defect-formation problems from occurring during resist imprinting. The self-assembled films prepared on the mold are resistant to immersion in acid and base, but treatment with oxygen plasma has an adverse effect on these molds' stabilities. © 2004 American Vacuum Society.

13244272357	Fabrication of autocloned photonic crystals by using high-density-plasma chemical vapor deposition	The high-density-plasma chemical vapor deposition (HDP-CVD) method was demonstrated as an alternativec to radio-frequency (if) bias sputtering method for fabrication of "autocloned" photonic crystals. We successfully preserved periodic surface corrugation after deposition of multilayer stacks under appropriate chemical vapor deposition conditions. Freedom of the shaping process was increased by simply raising the bias power of the autocloning process, and thus created autocloned structures having a strong modulation of the effective refractive index in the lateral direction. The method allows photonic bands of autocloned photonic crystals to be designed with greater controllability and a simpler fabrication process. Furthermore, the HDP-CVD method has better step-coverage than the sputtering method and can be used to fabricate autocloning structures with small feature-sizes. © 2004 American Vacuum Society.

13444280316	Purification of multi-walled carbon nanotubes through microwave heating of nitric acid in a closed vessel	We demonstrate that microwave-assisted heating in 5 mL of nitric acid eliminates impurities, such as amorphous carbon, carbon nanoparticles, and metals, from multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). Heating the closed reaction vessel under microwave irradiation at 160 °C for 30 min is a very effective means of purifying the MWNTs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirm that these reaction conditions are beneficial for removing the impurities and ensuring that the MWNTs remain intact. In contrast, a purification temperature of 180 °C provides too strongly oxidizing conditions that destroy the MWNTs. The ratio of the G and D bands in the Raman spectra also confirms that a temperature of 160 °C is optimal. The defect peak that we observed in the differential thermogravimetry (DTG) analysis of the raw material was not present after microwave purification. The presence of metal impurities in the MWNTs can be reduced significantly when using this method. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1242309934	Analysis of Experimental Data for Metallic Impurity Out-Diffusion from Deep-UV Photoresist	In a previous study [J. Electrochem. Soc., 146, 3455 (1999)], the radioactive tracer technique was employed to determine the percentages of manganese and zinc impurities diffused from a deep UV photoresist to various underlying substrates at different baking temperatures. For the same baking time, it was found that such "diffusion ratios" do not increase monotonically with temperature. Instead, as the baking temperature increases, the diffusion ratios may first increase and then decrease, first decrease and then increase, or simply decrease monotonically, depending upon the specific impurity/substrate combination. Here, to explain the various temperature dependences of the impurity diffusion ratios, we propose a theory that supplements the Fick's diffusion law with the Arrhenius law, which relates the diffusivities and interfacial segregation coefficients of the metallic impurities to the baking temperature. The theory also makes it possible to extract the values of important physicochemical parameters from raw experimental data, and the methodology is demonstrated in the paper by attempting to analyze the aforementioned experimental data. © 2004 The Electrochemical Society.
