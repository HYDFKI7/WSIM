79955386769	A general Poisson-Boltzmann model with position-dependent dielectric permittivity for electric double layer analysis	In this paper, we propose a general Poisson-Boltzmann model for electric double layer (EDL) analysis with the position dependence of dielectric permittivity considered. This model provides physically reasonable property profiles in the EDL region, and it is then utilized to investigate the depletion layer effect on EDL structure and interaction near hydrophobic surfaces. Our results show that both the electric potential and the interaction pressure between surfaces decrease due to the lower permittivity in the depletion layer. The reduction becomes more profound at larger variation magnitude and range. This trend is in general agreement with that observed from the previous stepwise model; however, that model has overestimated the influence of permittivity variation effect. For the thin depletion layer and the relative thick EDL, our calculation indicates that the permittivity variation effect on EDL usually can be neglected. Furthermore, our model can be readily extended to study the permittivity variation in EDL due to ion accumulation and hydration in the EDL region. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84864585906	Mass and momentum transfer across solid-fluid boundaries in the lattice-Boltzmann method	Mass conservation and momentum transfer across solid-fluid boundaries have been active topics through the development of the lattice-Boltzmann method. In this paper, we review typical treatments to prevent net mass transfer across solid-fluid boundaries in the lattice-Boltzmann method, and argue that such efforts are in general not necessary and could lead to incorrect results. Carefully designed simulations are conducted to examine the effects of normal boundary movement, tangential density gradient, and lattice grid resolution. Our simulation results show that the global mass conservation can be well satisfied even with local unbalanced mass transfer at boundary nodes, while a local mass conservation constraint can produce incorrect flow and pressure fields. These simulations suggest that local mass conservation, at either a fluid or solid boundary node, is not only an unnecessary consequence to maintain the global mass conservation, but also harmful for meaningful simulation results. In addition, the concern on the momentum addition and reduction associated with status-changing nodes is also not technically necessary. Although including this momentum addition or reduction has no direct influence on flow and pressure fields, the incorrect fluid-particle interaction may affect simulation results of particulate suspensions. © 2012 American Physical Society.

84888210227	Nonsingular terminal sliding mode fuzzy control for rocket launcher position servo system	A terminal sliding mode fuzzy control based on multiple sliding surfaces is proposed for uncertainties such as variation of inertia and moment in rocket launcher position servo system. The Nussbaum function is applied to compensate for uncertainties in controller and a fuzzy compensator is adopted to approximate unknown nonlinearities of the system. A nonsingular terminal sliding mode control(NTSMC)is utilized to drive the position error to converge in a finite period of time in the last step of designing. The influence of perturbation of system parameters and external disturbance on the rocket launcher position servo system can be minified. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can eliminate the chattering problem effectively and guarantee the response speed and control accuracy in comparison with traditional NTSMC, as well as possesses a strong robustness to parameter perturbation and load disturbance.

In view of this, the pneumatic equations are estabalised on the basis of modified corresponding state equation and improved virial equation for the high-pressure air catapult launch system, and the real dynamic thermodynamic processes are analyzed. The specific residual thermodynamic parameters of high pressure air are presented, the real thermal physical property parameters are also obtained under the wide variation conditions of temperature and pressure. The residual functions are applied to compensate the uncertainties of thermal physical property parameters, numerical experiments are performed. The comparison of the numerical results show that the value of residual enthalpy is high, the state of working fluid deviates from ideal gas; the compressibility of working fluid is strong, the compression factor reaches 1.1013; the real gas effect accelerates the pressure and temperature decreasing rates in the hyperbaric pressure chamber, and decelerates the increasing rates in the low pressure chamber; the real work capability of hyperbaric air is lower than that of ideal gas, the overload is steady. © 2013 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

84900468236	A rate-dependent constitutive model for honeycomb material and its application in a lunar lander	Honeycomb material is one of the most used buffer medium in the buffer device of a lunar lander, studying its mechanical properties is of significance for stability design of buffer devices of lunar lander and ascender's taking off from the moon's surface. Firstly, the in-plane and out-of-plane equivalent mechanical properties of honeycomb material were analyzed. and its rate-dependent transversely isotropic constitutive model was built considering the rate-dependent features of a honeycomb structure. Secondly, the user subroutine of the rate-dependent transversely isotropic constitutive model was written based on FEM, and its reliability was verified. Finally, taking a four-leg hanging rack lander as a study object, the influence of rate-dependent coefficients on its landing impact performance was studied. The results showed that with increase in a rate-dependent coefficient, the energy absorption of the buffer device increases firstly and then decreases, and reaches the maximum value when the coefficient is 0.6; the biggest impact acceleration of the lunar lander is increasing, and when the rate-dependent coefficient is larger, the growth rate of the biggest impact acceleration is bigger than that when the rate-dependent coefficient is smaller.

84899942904	Adaptive robust actuator fault accommodation for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with unknown control gains	An adaptive robust fault tolerant control approach is proposed for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with unknown signs of high-frequency gain and unmeasured states. In the recursive design, neural networks are employed to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, K-filters are designed to estimate the unmeasured states, and a dynamical signal and Nussbaum gain functions are introduced to handle the unknown sign of the virtual control direction. By incorporating the switching function σ algorithm, the adaptive backstepping scheme developed in this paper does not require the real value of the actuator failure. It is mathematically proved that the proposed adaptive robust fault tolerant control approach can guarantee that all the signals of the closed-loop system are bounded, and the output converges to a small neighborhood of the origin. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by the simulation examples. © 2014 Yuefei Wu et al.

84902529293	Adaptive robust control for mechatronic servo system with state constraints	A nonlinear adaptive robust tracking strategy based on high-gain observer was designed for the servo system with state constraint for actuator dynamics and state measurement noise. A high-gain observer based on the value of the position measurement system was introduced, which consisted of a series of filters to eliminate the noise on the accuracy of the observer and the gain was estimated to ensure the observer robustness. A novel barrier Lyapunov function was proposed for tracking desired guidance commands. In the process of the design, requirements on system states could be satisfied by limiting the magnitude of the virtual control signals. The entire uniform bounded stability of the closed-loop system was proved by Lyapunov method. The system test shows the method suggested in this paper can estimate the speed and position of the load. Compared with the traditional control method, it has the advantages of strong anti-jamming capability, good robustness and rapid speed.

84907246891	Pneumatic performance study of a high pressure ejection device based on real specific energy and specific enthalpy	In high-pressure dynamic thermodynamic processes, the pressure is much higher than the air critical pressure, and the temperature can deviate significantly from the Boyle temperature. In such situations, the thermo-physical properties and pneumatic performance can't be described accurately by the ideal gas law. This paper proposes an approach to evaluate the pneumatic performance of a high-pressure air catapult launch system, in which esidual functions are used to compensate the thermal physical property uncertainties of caused by real gas effects. Compared with the Nelson-Obert generalized compressibility charts, the precision of the improved virial equation of state is better than Soave-Redlich-Kwong (S-R-K) and Peng-Robinson (P-R) equations for high pressure air. In this paper, the improved virial equation of state is further used to establish a compressibility factor database which is applied to evaluate real gas effects. The specific residual thermodynamic energy and specific residual enthalpy of the high-pressure air are also derived using the modified corresponding state equation and improved virial equation of state which are truncated to the third virial coefficient. The pneumatic equations are established on the basis of the derived residual functions. The comparison of the numerical results shows that the real gas effects are strong, and the pneumatic performance analysis indicates that the real dynamic thermodynamic process is obviously different from the ideal one.

84920375134	Application of adaptive robust control in mechatronic servo system based on modified LuGre model	Mechatronic positioning servo system is a typical nonlinear system, and also usually exist many uncertainties. The nonlinear and uncertainties make the conventional controller not yield to the required system performance. Aiming at unknown dynamic friction parameters and unknown load characteristic, a adaptive friction compensation is designed for the servo system. The design of the controller is simplified by using a dynamic filter and an adaptive robust controller is designed to improve the system steady state accuracy and the robustness respectively. The output tracking error is proved to converge to a small neighborhood around zero and the performance of system tracking error can be guaranteed by appropriately choosing design parameters and introducing an initializing technique. Simulation and experiment results are shown to effectively inhibit the disadvantageous influence of friction and lay the foundation for improvement of dynamic performance of servo system.
