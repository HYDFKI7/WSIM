14844337428	The size distribution of Si nanoparticles prepared by pulsed-laser ablation in pure He, Ar or Ne gas	Nanocrystalline silicon films were prepared by pulsed-laser ablation in high-purity He, Ar or Ne gas at room temperature under a deposition pressure of 10 Pa. The Raman and X-ray diffraction spectra indicate that the films are nanocrystalline. Scanning electron microscopy images show that Ar or Ne gas, compared to He gas, yields smaller and more uniform-sized Si nanoparticles at the same deposition conditions, which is also confirmed by the blue-shifted and narrower peaks obtained in photoluminescence measurement. Ne gas induces the smallest and most uniform, in size, Si nanoparticles among all the three gases, which may be attributed to a more effective energy transfer between Si arid Ne atoms resulting from the adjacent degree of the atomic weights. © EDP Sciences.

The dynamics are analysed theoretically to explain the phenomenon. Furthermore, our result is compared with that in He gas.

2942696593	Formation process of Si nanoparticles deposited by pulse laser ablation	The deposited dynamic process of Si nanoparticles prepared by pulsed laser ablation is numerically simulated by using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. It is found that there is a mixed region where the high-density Si vapor peak and the gas peak are overlapped. The Si nanoparticles are formed by Si vapor condensation in the region and their sizes depend on the properties of the region such as density and range. The properties of the mixed region are changed constantly when its position are oscillated with time is increased, and get to stable state at certain a time, i.e., oscillating time. The oscillating time determines the distribution of nanoparticles in size. The influence of the experimental parameters on oscillating time of the mixed region is analyzed theoretically. The results show that the Si-based nanostructure materials with more uniform nanoparticles in size can be obtained by using appropriate proportion of He and Ar as ambient gas.

To weaken the parasitic reflections from the shell (perfectly conducting metal cylinder), more practically, the shell is considered as non-perfect conducting one, or moreover, it is supposed that the shell is separated from the laser. The threshold gain versus pair number of top Bragg mirror in the two situations is compared with that in the case of perfectly conducting metal cylinder. The result shows that the threshold gain curves are similar for high-order Bessel modes, and they are quite distinct for 0-order Bessel modes.

33751119064	Relation between size-distribution of Si nanoparticles and oscillation-stabilization time of the mixed region produced during laser ablation	Assuming Si particles and ambient atoms are elastic hard-spheres, the transportation in ambient gas of Si particles obtained by single-pulsed laser ablation is numerically simulated via Monte Carlo method to investigate the influence of the ambient species and the target-to-substrate distance on the oscillation-stabilization time (OST) of the mixed region. It is found that the ambient gas whose atomic weight is close to that of Si atom can induce the shortest OST; with increasing of the target-to-substrate distance, the OST at first decreases to its minimum, and then begins to increase. Incorporating with some experimental results on size-consistency of Si nanoparticles in pulsed laser ablation, it may be concluded that the shorter the OST of the mixed region, the more uniform the as-formed Si nanoparticles in size. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Raman, X-ray diffraction spectra, and scanning electron microscopy images show that with increasing pulse repetition rate, the average size of the nanoparticles in the film first decreases and reach its minimum at 20 Hz, and then increases, which may be attributed to the nonlinear dynamics of the laser-ablative deposition. In our experiment conditions, the duration of the ambient restoration, a characteristic parameter being used to distinguish nonlinear or linear region, is about a few seconds from the order of magnitude, which is consistent with the previous experimental observation. More detailed model to explain quantitively the observed effect is under investigation. Copyright © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results demonstrate that Ni in LSCONi-TiSi heterostructure is not oxidized after 550 °C annealing in oxygen. The structural properties of LSCOPZTLSCONi-TiSi are characterized by x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. It is found that Ni-Ti film is still amorphous and that there are no discernible reactions at the interfaces of the sample. LSCO/PZT/LSCO capacitor, measured at 5 V, possesses very good ferroelectric properties, such as low coercive field (∼1.28 V), high remnant polarization (∼27.9 μC cm2), and good fatigue-free characteristic, implying that ultrathin amorphous Ni-Ti film can be used as barrier layer for fabricating high-density ferroelectric random access memories. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

Subsequently, the additional laser beam as energy source was introduced, which crossed vertically the plasma plume from the top down in front of the target at a distance of 0.5 cm under same experiment condition. In this region, due to collision between the photon and the plasma plume, the transport of Si nanoparticles was impacted by the cross-laser beam. The Raman and x-ray diffraction spectra (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the films showed that Si nanoparticles were formed in a certain range, and the average size of Si nanoparticles monotonically decreases with the increase of distance. Obviously, the range of Si nanoparticles deposited in substrates became narrower due to the influence of additional laser beam.

It is found that the hcp and fcc sites are the most possible adsorption/insertion locations in the Ti (0 0 0 1)-(1 × 1)-H system. The hcp site is more stable than the fcc based on the analyses of the density of states and Mulliken population for Ti (0 0 0 1) surface of the two kinds of sites, which is attributed to the slight different interaction between H 1s states and Ti (0 0 0 1) 3d states. Adsorption energy, density of states, and Mulliken population are further used to discuss the octahedral and tetrahedral at the interlayer surface sites. It is found that the adsorption energy at the octahedral or the tetrahedral sites between the 2nd and the 3rd layers is bigger than that between the 1st and the 2nd, or the 3rd and the 4th layers.

The energy barriers for the hydrogen atom diffusion in different interstitial sites at the same layers or between adjacent layers are calculated. It is found that the energy barriers of H atom diffusion in the adjacent interstitial layers are bigger than that in the same interstitial layers. For the diffusion of H atom between adjacent interstitial layers, the diffusion between tetrahedral sites is easier than that between octahedral sites. While for diffusion of H atom between the same interstitial layers, the diffusion between tetrahedral sites is easier than that between tetrahedral and octahedral sites. Moreover, it is found that the most possible inside diffusion from hcp site of a hydrogen atom in the Ti(0001) outer-layer goes through tetrahedral sites. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.

A bunch of argon gas flow was introduced at 2.0 cm above the ablation point within the axial range from 0.3 cm to 3.0 cm, and the as-prepared Si nanoparticles were deposited on single crystalline Si substrates located at 2.0 cm under the ablation point. Surface morphology of films was observed by scanning electron microscopy(SEM). It is found that the size of grain, without introducing gas flow, increases initially and then decreases with increasing distance between target and substrate, and the peak appears at the distance of 1.7 cm. After introducing gas flow, the distribution of grain size changes.When introducing gas flow at the axial distance of 1.7 cm from the target, the peak value of grain size is the maximum. When introducing gas flow at the axial distance of 3.0 cm from the target, the peak value of grain size is the minimum.The position where the peak value of grain size appears moves away from the target as the distance between the gas flow and the ablation point increases.

We considered the substitutional positions, the interstitial positions with tetrahedral symmetry, and the interstitial positions with hexagonal symmetry. The results show that Au preferentially occupies the center substitutional position of the silicon nanowire. The doping of Au into silicon nanowires introduces an impurity level near the Fermi level. The bandgap values were less than those of pure silicon nanowires. For the substitutionally doping of silicon nanowires the density of states near the Fermi level were mainly contributed to by the Au d and p orbitals and the Si p orbital. Ferromagnetic behavior of the substitutionally doped nanowire was observed upon coupling the Au d and Si p states. For the interstitial doping of silicon nanowires nonmagnetic behavior was predicted.

The influence of inert gas pressure on growing rate of the film was investigated. The results show that with increasing gas pressure, growing rate first increases and reaches its maximum and then decreases; the gas pressure at the maximum of growing rate is proportional to the reciprocal of atomic mass of gas. The rate maximum is 0.315 Å/pulse when He gas pressure is 8.3 Pa. The dynamic process is analysed theoretically by means of resputtering from the film surface and scattering of ablated particles. Furthermore, our results are compared with those in the case of Ag target.
