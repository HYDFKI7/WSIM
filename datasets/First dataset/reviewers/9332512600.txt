1842376250	Chiroptical properties, structure, and absolute configuration of heterosubstituted 2(5H)-furanones	Chiroptical properties of a series of 3 and/or 4-heterosubstituted 2 (5H)furanones were investigated with respect to correlation with absolute configuration. The n - π* and n - π* Cotton effects have been assigned on the basis of comparison with the UV spectra in solvents of varying polarity. It is demonstrated that the n - π* transition in 4-amino substituted 2(5H)-furanones appears at shorter wavelength with respect to the n - π* transition. With the exception of 4-pyrrolidino and 4-benzylamino substituted 2(5H)-furanones, other heterosubstituted 2(5H)-furanones follow the butenolide configurational rule (Gawronski et al. J. Org. Chem. 61:1513- 1515, 1996). Absolute configuration of 2(5H)-furanone derivatives can also be assigned according to the sign of the Cotton effect (of unknown origin) at 200-230 nm. The structure of four representative sulfur and nitrogen substituted 2(5H)-furanones has been analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The results indicate planarity of the furanone ring and extended conjugation in 4-amino substituted 2(5H)-furanones.

22944432846	Outcome of low birthweight in China: A 16-year longitudinal study	Aim: To compare the growth and neurodevelopment of low-birthweight (LBW) and normal-birthweight (control) infants born and raised in China. Design: Prospective cohort study. Subjects and setting: 203 LBW (1200-2499 g) and 71 control (≥ 2500 g) infants born at two Shanghai hospitals in 1983 did not differ for date of birth, gender, parental occupation, parental weight and age. LBW < 10th centile at ≥ 37 wk gestation was defined as small for gestational age (SGA, n = 102). LBW at < 37 wk gestation was defined as preterm (n = 101). Main outcome measures: Weight, height, head circumference, Gesell developmental quotient (DQ), Wechsler intelligence quotient (IQ), and scholastic achievement score. Results: Of the 274 enrolled subjects, 234 (85%) returned at 6 mo, 135 (49%) at 6 y, and 104 (38%) at 16 y. SGA, preterm, and control subjects did not differ in rates of follow-up or baseline characteristics. However, SGA and preterm were lower than control subjects in weight and head circumference through 16 y, height through 4 y, DQ through 3 y, IQ at 5 and 16 y, and scholastic achievement at 16 y. Catch-up to growth in the control group, defined as > 3rd centile, and normal IQ, defined as ≥ 85, were both more common among preterm than SGA subjects. Conclusions: Adolescents in China with birthweights of 1200-2499 g, and particularly those who were SGA, lag behind peers with birthweights > 2500 g in physical growth, cognitive capacity, and school achievement. The findings suggest that LBW adolescents in China today represent a population in need of evaluation and support. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

A special subroutine was introduced while modeling the push-out test in order to control the interfacial failure. The results show that the shear strength evaluated from the push-out test is only a reference value. In addition, interfacial frictional shear stresses evaluated from the push-out test are reliable and play a key role in the mechanical performance of composites. © 2006 Acta Materialia Inc.

34147163387	Experimental and theoretical study of diffusion bonding in fabricating Ti matrix composite	Ti6Al4V/TA1 diffusion couples were fabricated and then heat-treated in vacuum under different conditions. The metallographic structure, morphologies and the composition distribution in diffusion bonding zone were investigated by means of OPM, SEM and EDS. The results indicate that the diffusion couples are bonded well; the alloying elements Al and V diffuse from Ti6Al4V to TA1, and Ti atoms diffuse in the opposite direction. The transition zone of the alloying elements obeys a rule of parabolic rate. At the same time, based on Koher's ternary solution model and Miedema's model for calculating the thermodynamical interaction coefficients, the theoretical diffusion profiles of Ti and alloying elements are obtained according to the inter-diffusion coefficients of the alloying elements and the numerical solution of the phenomenological equation. Moreover, the calculated values are well fitted to the experimental data. So the distribution of the diffusion atoms can be predicted at the diffusion bonding interface. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

37449003984	In situ fabrication of TiC particulates locally reinforced aluminum matrix composites by self-propagating reaction during casting	TiC ceramic particulates locally reinforced aluminum matrix composites were successfully fabricated via self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) reaction of Al-Ti-C system during aluminum melt casting. The SHS reaction could be initiated when Al contents in the green compacts ranged from 20 wt.% to 40 wt.%. With increasing Al contents, the ignition delay time was prolonged and the adiabatic combustion temperature was lowered. Using XRD and DSC analysis, the SHS reaction characteristic was discussed. The result showed that Al serves not only as a diluent but also as an intermediate reactant participating in the SHS reaction, determining the reaction process and its final producsts. The SEM images revealed a relatively uniform distribution and nearly spherical morphology of TiC particulates in the locally reinforced region, and excellent adhesion and gradient distribution between the TiC particulates reinforced region and Al-matrix. The size of the TiC particulates decreased obviously with increasing Al contents in the blends. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0032679935	Nano-scaled multilayered bulk materials manufactured by repeated pressing and rolling in the Ag-Fe and Cu-Fe systems	The repeated application of mechanical deformation of metallic materials has been proved to be an effective technique for producing bulk nano-scaled regulated structures. These materials have been shown to have unique properties characteristic for nano-materials, such as high mechanical strength, giant magneto-resistivity and thermoelectricity. This paper reports further experimental results obtained on bulk nano-scaled materials produced by repeated pressing and rolling of alternately stacked thin metallic foils and of metallic powder mixtures in the systems Ag-Fe and Cu-Fe. The physical properties examined include giant-magneto-resistivity and magneto-thermo-electric-power, measured both parallel and perpendicular to the nano-scaled layers, and the tensile strength parallel to the layers. These properties are checked as a function of the layer thickness. The bulk nano-scaled multi-layered materials obtained by the present work are unique in the sense that the physical properties can be examined in the direction perpendicular to the layers. Microstructural examination demonstrated that the present method can generate almost the same nano-scaled layered structure by starting from the thin foils or from the powder mixtures.

Tensile strength of the as-prepared composites was tested, and thermal exposure of the composites in vacuum was carried out at 700 or 800 °C for different duration in order to investigate the thermal stability of Mo interlayer. Interfacial microstructure of the as-prepared and thermal-exposed composites was studied detailedly with the help of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and transaction electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that, on the one hand, the original Mo coating becomes three layers: the residual Mo layer, a very thin layer of TiC (about 200. nm) and a mixed layer of Mo + β-Ti. In addition, there are two layers of the matrix that affected by the dissolution of Mo atoms between Mo + β-Ti layer and the normal matrix, which are identified to be β-Ti and a mixture of β-Ti with strip-like α-Ti, respectively. On the other hand, the tensile strength of the composites is significantly improved as the Mo coating can effectively hinder the fiber/matrix interfacial reaction, and the thermal exposure analysis indicates that Mo coating has excellent thermal stability when temperature is blow 700 °C. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84876718169	Properties of graphitized boron-doped coal-based coke powders as anode for lithium-ion batteries	Coal-based coke powder is a by-product when coke is smashed for metallurgy and chemical industry. There is a vast output of coke powder every year around world, most of which is combusted as cheap fuel or abandoned directly. In this work, the electrochemical performance of graphitized boron-doped coal-based coke powder as anode for lithium ion batteries was investigated. The effects of boron content and graphitization temperature on the anode performance of boron-doped coal-based coke powder were also investigated in this paper. Results showed that a reversible capacity of 360.3 mA h/g of boron-doped coal-based coke powder can be obtained, while that of unboron-doped was 292.9 mA h/g. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis for the boron-doped coal-based coke powder showed that the distance between carbon layers was lowered by a proper amount of doped boron and higher graphitization temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) analysis was carried out to explain the effect of boron doping on the electrochemical performances of coal-based coke anodes. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

44949226945	Effect of the interfacial reaction layer thickness on the thermal residual stresses in SiCf/Ti-6Al-4V composites	A three-dimensional finite element model was developed to study the effects of the interfacial reaction layer thickness on the distribution of the thermal residual stresses near the interfacial reaction layer in continuous SiC fiber reinforced Ti-6Al-4V composite. The interfacial reaction layer thicknesses in real composites were adopted in the present analysis. The hoop, radial and axial stresses at the fiber and interfacial reaction layer (f/i interface), middle of the interfacial reaction layer and interfacial reaction layer and matrix (i/m interface) were studied for each thickness. The results show the interfacial reaction layer thickness has a significant influence on the distribution of the thermal residual stresses near the interfacial reaction layer. X-ray stress measurements indicate that the prediction data have a good agreement with the experimental results. The interfacial radial cracks appear not only in the as-processed sample but also in the heat-treated samples. Experimental observations suggest that the f/i interfacial debonding is not significant during the transverse tensile loading. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

44949257963	An analysis of thermal residual stresses in SiCf/Cu composites when TiC or Ni as binder	The interfacial bonding strength of SiC fiber reinforced copper matrix composites is extremely weak. Using Ti or other metallic elements such as Fe, Ni, Mo can improve the fiber/matrix bonding strength because these elements can form carbides or an interdiffusion zone between the fiber and the matrix though a heat treatment. In this paper, a TiC reaction layer or Ni interlayer is introduced as a binder, and thermal residual stresses (TRS) in the SiC fiber, TiC or Ni interlayers, and matrix are simulated by means of finite element method. The results indicate that the matrix undergoes significant plastic deformation when the composite is cooled to room temperature from the bonding temperature, and the residual plastic strains are highest around the interlayers and decrease as distance from the interlayer increases; the values and distributions of hoop stresses and Von Mises stresses in the matrix are nearly identical when different interlayers are used, while the magnitudes of these stresses are significantly different in different kinds of interlayers. The distribution characteristics of axial residual stresses in the matrix change when different interlayers are used, and Ni is superior to TiC as the axial stresses greatly decrease near the axial end of the composite. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) reveals that the thick ZrC hexagonal platelets (≤1 μm) grew through the layer-by-layer growth mechanism of thin hexagonal monolayers along [1 1 1] direction, while the thin monolayer (≤40 nm) was formed via two-dimensional (2D) nucleation mode along (1 1 1) plane. The formation and growth mechanism of the ZrC platelets have been discussed in detail. Al additive in the compact played an important role in determining the formation and growth of ZrC platelets, serving not only as a diluent to inhibit the ZrC grains from coarsening, but as an intermediate reactant to participate in the reaction process. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The size of ZrC particles evidently reduced from -160 nm with a nearly spherical shape in 30 mass% Al to -60 nm with a tetragonal morphology in 40 mass% Al. The reaction mechanism to form ZrC was discussed by DTA and X-ray diffraction analysis. The results revealed that ZrAI3 metastable phase was initially formed by Al-Zr reaction, and then the formation of nano-scale ZrC grain was controlled by the dissolution of C into a Zr-Al melt and the precipitation from the melt. Al in the compact serves not only as a diluent inhibiting the ZrC particle from coarsening, but also as an intermediate reactant participating in the reaction process. © 2008 ISIJ.

With kinetic Monte Carlo method, a three-dimensional atomic-scale of {111}-oriented SiC film is established and its growth process is simulated by MATLAB. The results show that the growth of film has three stages including form of little islets, mergence and expanding of islets and dynamic balance between islets. With the increase of substrate temperature, deposition rate, surface roughness and height of film all increase.

The reaction behavior and formation path of TiC were investigated. Because of the non-steady-state oscillatory propagation of combustion wave front, the typical swelled and layered reaction products were observed. With Al contents increasing, the reaction temperatures decreased and the TiC particles sizes evidently reduced.

The typical layered structures of the reaction products were observed due to the non-steady-state oscillatory motion of the combustion wave. With the Al content increasing, the reaction temperature decreased and the ZrC particle sizes evidently reduced from ~ 8 μm in Al free to ~ 50 nm in 40 mass% Al. The microstructures and formation mechanism of ZrC have been analyzed using XRD, SEM and quenched experiment. For Al free, including the low Al content, the formation of ZrC was controlled by the dissolution of C into a Zr melt or a solid ZrC layer. While for the high Al content, the formation of ZrC was controlled by the dissolution of C into a Zr-Al melt and the precipitation of ZrC, in which Al serves not only as a diluent to inhibit the ZrC particles from coarsening, but also as an intermediate reactant to participate in the reaction process. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

63449121471	Effects of lifestyle on micronuclei frequency in human lymphocytes in Japanese hard-metal workers	Objective: The risks of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other major causes of mortality are largely attributable to lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol drinking, hours of working and sleeping, physical activity, diet, and stress. Earlier studies have suggested that an unhealthy lifestyle is also associated with increased lymphocyte sensitivity to mutagens, oxidative DNA damage level, and leukocyte DNA damage. In order to explore the genotoxicity of unhealthy lifestyle, we evaluated the effect of overall lifestyle as well as some individual lifestyle factors on micronuclei (MN) frequency in cultured human lymphocytes. Method: The study was conducted among 208 healthy adult (19 to 59 years) male Japanese hard-metal workers. The subjects were divided into groups according to their self-reported good, moderate, and poor lifestyles based on their responses to a questionnaire regarding eight health practices (cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, sleeping hours, working hours, physical exercise, eating breakfast, balanced nutrition, and mental stress), the presence or absence of each of which was summed to obtain a health practice index (HPI: range 0-8). Peripheral blood was taken and the cytokinesis-block micronuclei (CBMN) assay was performed. Results: Total lifestyle quality as measured by the HPI was strongly negatively associated with MN frequency in cultured human lymphocytes (p < 0.01). Nutritional imbalance, lack of regular exercise (< 2 times per week), insufficient sleep ( ≤ 6 h per day), and overtime working (≥ 9 h per day) each contributed significantly to higher MN frequency (all p < 0.05). In the smoker group, a significantly higher MN frequency was only found in heavy smokers (p < 0.05). On the other hand, mental stress, eating breakfast, and alcohol drinking had no effect on MN frequency. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings indicate that poor lifestyle habits significantly increase MN frequency in human lymphocytes. © 2009.

The time-dependent density functional theory was used to determine their vertical transition energies and corresponding oscillator strengths. Calculations show that different side groups in these linear carbon chains can significantly modify their structural and electronic properties, whereas the effect of terminal substitution is negligible. Predicted equilibrium geometries indicate that the single, double, and triple bonds of PDAs and their derivatives are almost unchanged as the chain increases, showing a remarkable character of localized bond. The periodic boundary condition calculations reveal that the strongest adsorption for the infinite chain of PDA appears at 723 nm, and the HOMO → LUMO excitation is responsible for this strong electronic transition. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.

0035281490	Quantitative substituent effect on the second-order hyperpolarizabilities of polymers based on the quantum chemical studies	To obtain the in-depth identification of the electronic nature of the substituent effects, which have been recognized as a facilitated means to elevate the second-order hyperpolarizabilities (γ) of polymers, the systematic quantum chemical studies have been carried out on the tried systems (polyphenyls) of longer chain length (17 phenyl units) and more versatile substitution types (seven kinds) than ever. All polymers are fully optimized and the nonlinear optical properties are based on the finite-field model with PM3 Hamiltonian. The computational results have been validated by available experimental and theoretical data. As found in the experiments, the computed energy levels converge in the range of long chain length, indicating a gradually decreased coupling between components. Both the heat of formations and γ values of the studied polymers with substituents are found to parallel to those without substituents, which can be explained by the first-order approximation of the additivity law of properties for weakly coupled multi-component systems. This quantitative component effect or the substituent effect may build a theoretical ground to extrapolate long chain polarized polymers on the basis of oligomers. As for the molecular design guidelines, the preferential site for better conjugation, the larger number of substituents, and the more powerful polar groups are favored to elevate γ.

Then, graft polymerization of MAA onto the esterified HAP particles surfaces was carried out by ultraviolet light (UV) initiation. The structure of the surface-esterified and grafted HAP was studied by ESCA, FTIR, Scanning Electron microscopy, laser particle sizes analyze, esterification, and graft degrees tests. The results show that poly(methyl acrylic acid) (PMAA) is successfully inserted onto HAP particles surfaces by covalent bond linkage. The esterification degree between MAA and HAP particles increases with reaction temperature and time, and tends to level off at about 6 h under 90°C. The graft degree of MAA onto HAP particles with 1.14% esterification degree and its average particle sizes increase with UV initiation polymerization time, and to reach a maximum at 25 min under 40°C, then decrease as irradiation time further increases.

77955496117	Caveolin-1 protects against sepsis by modulating inflammatory response, alleviating bacterial burden, and suppressing thymocyte apoptosis	Sepsis is a leading cause of death, which is characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory response. In this study, we report that caveolin-1, a major component of caveolae, is a critical survival factor of sepsis. We induced sepsis using a well established sepsis animal model, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). CLP induced 67% fatality in caveolin-1 null mice, but only 27% fatality in wild type littermates (p = 0.015). Further studies revealed that mice deficient in caveolin-1 exhibited marked increase in tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 production 20 h following CLP treatment, indicating uncontrolled inflammatory responses in the absence of caveolin-1. Caveolin-1 null mice also had a significant increase in bacteria number recovered from liver and spleen, indicating elevated bacterial burdens. In addition, caveolin-1 null mice had a 2-fold increase in thymocyte apoptosis compared with wild type littermates, indicating caveolin-1 as a critical modulator of thymocyte apoptosis during sepsis. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that caveolin-1 is a critical protective modulator of sepsis in mice. Caveolin-1 exerts its protective function likely through its roles in modulating inflammatory response, alleviating bacterial burdens, and suppressing thymocyte apoptosis. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

77957578738	Effect of thermal exposure on the thermal expansion behavior of SiCf/Ti-6Al-4V composite	SiCf/Ti-6Al-4V composites were used to study the effects of thermal exposure on the thermal expansion behavior of composites. The expansion behaviors of the matrix alloy, as-processed composite, and composites exposed at 900°C for 10, 25 and 75 h were investigated by coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) test. The results indicate both in longitudinal and transverse direction, the CTE of the exposed composite is higher than that of the as-processed composite. The CTEs of the specimens exposed at 900°C for 10 and 75 h are higher than that of the specimen exposed at 900°C for 25 h, no matter in longitudinal or transverse direction. It can be attributed to that there is an appropriate interfacial reaction for the composite exposed at 900°C for 25 h. Because the prediction of Schapery's model for CTE of composite includes the influence of thermal tensile residual stress in matrix at the whole heating process, the CTE results predicted by Schapery's model are lower than the real CTE obtained from experiments at the high temperature stage of the CTE curve.

78149250521	Fracture toughness of SiCf/Ti-6Al-4V composites	Apparent fracture toughness of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy uniaxially reinforced with SiC fibers was measured by three-point bending test and the effect of the interfacial reaction on toughness was discussed. It is pointed out that bridging of the intact fibers in plastic zone ahead of the crack tip plays an important role for fracture toughness of the composites. And fracture toughness of the heat-treated composites decreases due to the severe interfacial reaction that leads to damage of the SiC fibers and therefore the decrease of the load-bearing ability, and to the increase of the brittleness in the titanium matrix.

79953741401	Preparation of polyaniline hollow micro-sphere materials with template method and its electrochemical properties	The polystyrene (PS) micro-sphere was used as the template to prepare PS/polyaniline (PANI) core-shell materials. The aniline monomers were first absorbed on the surface of the PS micro-sphere, and then were polymerized to PANI by the chemical oxygenation method. As this, the PS/PANI materials were obtained. After that, the PS micro-spheres were removed by dissolution and the PANI hollow micro-spheres were obtained. The obtained materials were characterized by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscope, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. At the same time, the cyclic voltammogram, galvanostatic charging/discharging testing and cycle life testing were used to characterize the obtained material electrochemical performances. The results showed that the specific capacitance of the obtained PANI hollow micro-sphere material could be up to 116F/g (in organic electrolyte), which was greatly better than that of the normal PANI material by the same chemical oxygenation method (65F/g), indicating the PANI hollow micro-sphere material had excellent electrochemical application foreground.

79959891726	Study on N type 4H-SiC minority carrier lifetime by microwave photoconductivity decay technology	Microwave photoconductivity decay technology is used to measure the minority carrier lifetime of N type 4H-SiC. Respectively setting the excitation intensity to 100%, 50%, 25% and 5%, the minority carrier lifetime is measured. The results indicated that the minority carrier lifetime of N type 4H-SiC sample is about 0.138s and the incident laser intensity is not the main factor to increase or decrease the lifetime. But when the incident laser intensity is weakening, the signal wave amplitude is lessened and the noise is correspondingly increased. This means some weak signal measurement technology such as filter or smooth window must be used. The experiment indicated that Microwave photoconductivity decay technology is convenient and efficient to measure the N type carrier lifetime which have a great significance to 4H-SiC. © 2011 IEEE.

The results indicate that GBPs show both spherical and lenticular shapes and triangularly distribute along grain boundary (GB). Based on 3D observations from various directions, the values of GBP relevant parameters such as GBP size, center to center distance, number of GBPs per unit GB area and area fraction of GB covered by GBPs are further determined. The 3D method for GBP relevant parameter determination seems an effective way to avoid misunderstandings in the conventional two dimensional (2D) methods induced by GBP overlapping and projection effect as well as curved GB surface. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79960808886	Microcystin-LR induces apoptosis via NF-κB /iNOS pathway in INS-1 cells	Cyanobacterial toxins, especially the microcystins, are found in eutrophied waters throughout the world, and their potential to impact on human and animal health is a cause for concern. Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is one of the common toxic microcystin congeners and occurs frequently in diverse water systems. Recent work suggested that apoptosis plays a major role in the toxic effects induced by MC-LR in hepatocytes. However, the roles of MC-LR in pancreatic beta cells have not been fully established. The aim of the present study was to assess possible in vitro effects of MC-LR on cell apoptosis in the rat insulinoma cell line, INS-1. Our results demonstrated that MC-LR promoted selectively activation of NF-κB (increasing nuclear p50/p65 translocation) and increased the mRNA and protein levels of induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The chronic treatment with MC-LR stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production derived from iNOS and induced apoptosis in a dose dependent manner in INS-1 cells. Meanwhile, this effect was inhibited by the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC, which reversed the apoptosis induced by MC-LR. Our observations indicate that MC-LR induced cell apoptosis via an iNOS-dependent pathway. A well-known nuclear transcription factor, NF-κB, is activated and mediates intracellular nitric oxide synthesis. We suggest that the apoptosis induced by chronicMC-LR in vivo presents a possible cause of β-cell dysfunction, as a key environmental. © 2011 by the authors.

80051817082	Modification of grafting poly (butylene terephthalate) nonwoven	Surface modification of poly (butylene terephthalate) nonwoven (PBTNW) was achieved by grafting in order to improve the wettability and hemocompatibility. Graft-polymerization of chitosan (CS) and acrylamide (AM) onto PBTNW induced by alkylpolyglycoside (APG) using benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as an initiator was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere. The effects of chitosan, acrylamide concentration, reaction temperature and duration of graft-polymerization were studied. Evidence of grafting was obtained by comparing FT-IR spectra, RAMAN, XRD, TG and scanning electron microscopy images of original PBTNW and the grafted copolymer. It is shown that to achieve an optimal grafting results the concentration of chitosan and acrylamide are 3.0% and 0.05%, respectively, with reaction time of 60 min and reaction temperature of 70°C. The chitosan-grafted PBTNW exhibits a hydrophilic character and hemocompatibility. The chitosan and acrylamide modified PBTNW is applicable as a blood filter material.

80052724466	Expression and clinical significance of the DNA repair enzyme MYH in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	MYH is an important enzyme in combating DNA oxidative stress in the occurrence and development of various types of tumors. To investigate the correlation between expression of the DNA repair enzyme MYH in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) oxidative damage, as well as the clinical significance of altered MYH expression, tissues from 175 esophageal carcinoma cases were investigated in the present study. MYH expression and 8-oxoG oxidative damage in squamous cell carcinoma and adjacent normal tissue were assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. In 82.9% (145/175) of the cases, MYH protein expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was lower than that of adjacent normal tissue (t=4.24, P<0.001). Additionally, 8-oxoG staining was higher in the tumors than in the normal tissue. Lower expression of MYH in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was associated with depth of invasion, venous invasion, TNM stage and lymph node metastasis (P<0.05). In conclusion, a lower MYH expression level in esophageal cell carcinoma tissue was inversely associated with more severe 8-oxoG oxidative damage, suggesting that changes in MYH activity correspond to increased DNA damage in tumor cells. The use of MYH expression as a postoperative index for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma may guide the formulation of individualized chemotherapy for patients after surgery. © 2011 Spandidos Publications Ltd.

80052782589	Association between the hMSH2 IVS12-6 T>C polymorphism and cancer risk: A meta-analysis	The hMSH2 gene, a member of the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway, plays a key role in the maintenance of genomic integrity. The common sequence variation in hMSH2, IVS12-6 T>C, has been implicated in cancer risk. However, the results of published studies on this polymorphism remain conflicting. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify the role of the hMSH2 IVS12-6 T>C polymorphism in cancer. We performed a comprehensive literature search updated to March 2011 of studies on the associations between the hMSH2 IVS12-6 T>C polymorphism and cancer risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the associations. Thirteen studies involving 7,527 patients and 8,762 control subjects were included in this meta-analysis. The overall results indicated no major influence of the polymorphism on cancer risk. However, stratified analysis by cancer types showed that the hMSH2 IVS12-6 polymorphism increased the risk for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (heterozygote comparison: OR=1.62; 95% CI 1.06-2.47). When stratified by the source of controls, significant associations were observed in hospital-based populations (heterozygote comparison: OR=1.28; 95% CI 1.02-1.61). These results indicate that the polymorphism of hMSH2, IVS12-6, may cause a different effect in different types of cancers. To draw more comprehensive conclusions, further prospective studies with larger numbers of participants worldwide are required to examine the associations between this polymorphism and cancer risk. © 2011 Spandidos Publications Ltd.

It is found that after long-time heat treatment, the calculated strength is in accordance with the measured one. But the former is higher than the later for the as-prepared sample. SEM and TEM observations show that with prolonging the holding time at 900°C, the interfacial reaction zone of the SiC/Ti-6Al-4V becomes thicker and the C-coating of the SiC fiber thinner, leading to the decrease of the tensile strength and the increase of the interfacial shear strength.

83655167110	PEBP4 gene expression and its significance in invasion and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer	The goal of this study was to investigate the function of phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 4 (PEBP4) in invasion and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PEBP4 mRNA and protein expression in 56 cases of NSCLC tissues were detected using RT-PCR and Western blot, and the relationship between PEBP4 expression and invasion and metastasis of NSCLC was analyzed. The change in the invasive ability of human NSCLC cell line HCC827 was observed after knocking down PEBP4 expression using RNA interference. PEBP4 mRNA and protein expression in cancer tissues of patients with lymph node metastasis were significantly higher than those in patients without lymph node metastasis (p∈<∈0.05). PEBP4 expression significantly decreased in HCC827 cells after transfection with PEBP4 siRNA (p∈<∈0.01), and the number of HCC827 cells that migrated through Transwell chambers was significantly lower than that of non-transfected control and transfected control cells (p∈<∈0.01).

In 58 samples of NSCLC tissue and normal adjacent tissue, methylation of the RUNX3 gene promoter was measured by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Correlation with clinicopathological characteristics was assessed. The results demonstrated that RUNX3 gene promoter methylation was present in 26/58 (44.8%) of NSCLC tissue samples and 10/58 (17.2%) of normal tissue samples, and that the difference was statistically significant between the two groups (χ2=10.311, p=0.001). Significantly, methylation of the RUNX3 gene promoter correlated with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis and the degree of differentiation (p<0.05) but not with age, gender, smoking history and pathological type (p>0.05). In conclusion, methylation of the RUNX3 gene promoter had a high relevance ratio in NSCLC tissue and correlated with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis and degree of differentiation; thus, this association may have clinical significance in NSCLC.

These dendritic hosts exhibit high triplet energy (≥2.85 eV), excellent film-forming ability (with low root-mean-square (rms) values less than 0.2 nm), high glass-transition temperatures in the range of 242-248 °C, and the appropriate HOMO energy levels (-5.33 - 5.35 eV) facilitating the transfer of holes from Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):Poly(styrene-4-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) to the emitting layer.

The nonplanar star-shaped configuration of Cz-TCB limited the effective extension of their π-conjugation, leading to the same triplet energy of 2.86 eV. No noticeable signals of Cz-TCB related to glass transition is observed in the DSC curves. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements indicate the excellent thermal and morphological stability of the dendrimer. The performance of the novel host material based devices is far superior to those of the corresponding 1,3,5-tri(N-carbazolyl)benzene (TCB) based devices, which is outstanding for a solution-processed blue PhOLED. The best performance of iridium(iii) bis(4,6-(di-fluorophenyl)-pyridinato-N,C′ (FIrpic) based devices show a turn-on voltage of 4.6 V, a maximum external quantum efficiency of 13.0%, and a maximum luminance efficiency of 25.7 cd A

84862972417	Preparation and characterization of carbon nanotube network via a filtration method	The single carbon nanotube (CNT) has lots of important potential applications in many fields for its good electrical conductivity and mechanical property. But, single CNT is a nanometer material, and a powder from the macro point of view, which would hinder its applications. So there is need to CNT macro material. There are two ways to make the lots of single CNTs into macro materials: adding adhesive and without adhesive by other methods. Of course, adding adhesive can result in impurity. So the method without adhesive is a better way. But the way has no connections between the single CNTs and can result in that the obtained macro materials electrical conductivity and mechanical property are not as good as that of the single CNT. In order to resolve the problem, the authors firstly made the single CNTs into a macro material (CNT network precursor) via filtration method, and then grew new CNT between the close pristine single CNTs. The obtained macro material can have much better (ten times) electrical conductivity and mechanical property than those of the CNT network precursor. The obtained material and the CNT network precursor were both characterized by SEM, electrical conductivity testing and mechanical property testing. © The Nonferrous Metals Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

84863055532	Correlation of E-cadherin and CD44v6 expression with clinical pathology in esophageal carcinoma	Cell adhesion, important for maintaining tissue architecture, plays a role in numerous cancers and particularly in tumor progression. In the present study, we investigated perturbations in the expression of two important adhesion proteins, epithelial (E)-cadherin and CD44v6, in esophageal carcinoma (EC). EC specimens were obtained from 42 patients undergoing resection of EC; both cancer and adjacent normal tissue were collected. Expression of E-cadherin and CD44v6 was detected by immunohistochemistry and the correlation between the expression of these two proteins and their individual relationships with pathology were determined. E-cadherin expression in EC tissue was significantly less common than in adjacent normal tissue. Furthermore, absence of E-cadherin expression was correlated with infiltration depth, lymph node metastasis, distant metastases and TNM stage (P<0.05), but not with gender, age, differentiation or tumor size. By contrast, CD44v6 expression in EC was significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissue and was correlated with differentiation, distant metastases and TNM stage (P<0.05), but not with other clinicopathological parameters. Additionally, we observed a negative correlation between E-cadherin and CD44v6 expression in EC (P<0.05). Based on their correlations with pathology, we suggest that the expression of E-cadherin and CD44v6 is important roles in promoting the infiltration and metastasis of EC.

To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a metaanalysis was performed. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to assess the association between MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. A total of 15 studies including 10,753 cases and 11,275 controls described C677T genotypes, among which 11 articles totalling 6,161 cases and 7,684 controls described A1298C genotypes, were also involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, no significantly elevated lung cancer risk was found in any genetic models when all studies were pooled. For C677T polymorphism: (TT vs. CC: OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.97-1.42; TC vs. CC: OR =1.06, 95% CI = 0.94-1.20; dominant model: OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.96-1.24; and recessive model: OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.95-1.24); for A1298C polymorphism: (CC vs. AA: OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.91-1.19; AC vs. AA: OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.91-1.06; dominant model: OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.92-1.06; and recessive model: OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.92-1.20). In the subgroup analyses, the results showed that 677T varients could decrease lung cancer risk in female (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.41- 0.95, P-value = 0.03, 677CC as reference). No evidence of any associations of MTHFR A1298C polymorphism with lung cancer was found in overall or subgroup analyses. Our meta-analysis supports that the common polymorphisms of C677T and A1298C in MTHFR gene are not susceptibility gene for lung cancer from currently available evidence. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.

Radial residual stress in fiber and interfacial layer increases with increasing elastic modulus of interfacial layer, but little influence on the residual stress of matrix is observed. The increasing of interfacial layer thickness gives a little effect on the residual stress in matrix, but makes the residual stress slightly decrease.

The grafted product, which referred to as POSS-g-GO, was used to modify epoxy resin (EP) matrix. The epoxy/POSS-g-GO nanocomposites were fabricated using ultrasonication and the cast molding method and confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and thermogravimetric analysis techniques. The results revealed that the incorporation of a small amount of POSS-g-GO caused a significant improvement in ultimate tensile strength, impact strength and roughness. With 2 wt% POSS-g-GO ultimate tensile strength and flexural strength of the composites were improved by 24.8 and 56.6 %, respectively. The impact strength was 42.97 kJ/m2, which is 2.5 times higher than that of the pure EP (17.49 kJ/m2). The DMA results showed that the moduli of the nanocomposites in glass and rubbery states were significantly higher than those of the control epoxy. It indicated that incorporation of POSS-g-GO into epoxy networks was the efficient load transfer between the POSS-g-GO additives and epoxy matrix through covalent links. Morphological structure of the impact fracture surface of the epoxy/POSS-g-GO composites was observed by scanning electron microscope, as well. © Iran Polymer and Petrochemical Institute 2012.

For the non-line phase change characteristic of PCMs, the thermal performance of lauric acid and capric acid mixed fatty acid were studied. The phase change temperature and latent heat of the PCMs were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), DRE-2C thermal conductivity coefficient instrument was used to test the thermal conductivity coefficient of different mole ratio PCMs and PCMs in different test temperature. A kind of composite PCMs made up of inorganic porous materials diatomite and fatty acid PCMs were produced, the thermal conductivity coefficient and the heat absorption-release performance of the materials were tested. Finite element method (FEM) was used for analyzing the heat transfer problems of the PCMs. The results showed that the thermal conductivity coefficient of fatty acid PCMs has an inversely proportional relationship with the phase change temperature, the higher the phase change temperature, the lower the thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity of the PCMs grow larger as the test temperature increased. By admixing with diatomite, the thermal conductivity coefficient of the PCMs obviously increased, so did the heat absorption and release rate. Heat transfer progress of the PCMs can be well described by FEM analysis, the analysis of FEM showed that the heat conductivity performance of the PCMs should be enhanced to accelerate the phase change rate and frequency.

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) and their optical properties were investigated by using UV-vis spectrophotometer, fluorescence spectrophotometer (FL), IR spectrophotometer and confocal laser scanning microscope. The synthesized ZnSe/ZnS QDs illuminated blue fluorescence under ultraviolet lamp. Its water-soluble property is excellent and the fluorescence intensity of ZnSe/ZnS QDs almost did not change after 4 months at room temperature. The average diameter of ZnSe/ZnS nanocrystals is about 3 nm and quantum yield (QY) could reach to 70.6% after repeat determination. Low cytotoxicity was ensured by investigated SCG7901 and RAW264.7 cells. In comparison with cadmium based nanocrystals, ZnSe/ZnS QDs posed low cytotoxicity. The cells viability remained 96.7% when the QDs concentration was increased to 10 μmol/L.

84872102481	Synthesis and properties of novel random copolymers of poly(ether ketone ether ketone ketone)-poly(ether ketone imide)	Bis[4-(p-phenoxybenzoyl)-1,2-benzenedioyl]-N,N,N',N'-4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether (BPBDADPE) was prepared by the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction of diphenyl ether (DPE) with bis(4-chloroformyl-1,2-benzenedioyl)-N,N,N',N'-4,4'- diaminodiphenyl ether (BCBDADPE). Novel random copolymers of poly(ether ketone ether ketone ketone)(PEKEKK)-poly(ether ketone imide)(PEKI) were synthesized by the modified electrophilic Friedel-Crafts copolycondensation of terephthaloyl chloride (TPC) with a mixture of 4,4'-diphenoxybenzophenone (DPOBPN) and BPBDADPE, over a wide range of DPOBPN/BPBDADPE molar ratios, in the presence of anhydrous aluminum chloride and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE).

84872718720	Interfacial properties and electronic structure of β-SiC(111)/α- Ti(0001): A first principle study	First-principles calculations of β-SiC(111)/α-Ti(0001) interface have been performed and the adhesion strength, interface energy, interfacial fracture toughness, and electronic structure are obtained. Six C-terminated β-SiC(111)/α-Ti(0001) interface models are investigated to clarify the influence of stacking sites and Ti atoms tilt direction on the interface bonding and fracture toughness. The hollow-site-stacked interfaces, in which Ti atoms locate on the hollow site of interfacial C atoms (cases III and IV), are more thermodynamically stable with larger work of adhesion, and interfacial fracture toughness. The center-site-stacked (cases I and II) and top-site-stacked (cases V and VI) interfaces have a decreasing interface adhesion as the order. The electronic structure of hollow-site-stacked interface (case IV) gives the evidence that atomic bonding exists between interfacial C, Si, and Ti atoms, and the C-Ti bonds exhibit more covalent features than Si-Ti. The tilt direction of Ti atoms, namely the stacking style of Ti, has a subtle and secondary effect on the interface stability. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.

84872807689	PEBP4 enhanced HCC827 cell proliferation and invasion ability and inhibited apoptosis	The purposes of this study were to investigate the effects of phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 4 (PEBP4) on the cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and to provide evidence for future treatment options for NSCLC. Western blot assays were performed to examine PEBP4 protein expression levels in NSCLC cell lines (HCC827, A549, NCI-H661, NCI-H292, and 95-D) and a normal human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell line. A PEBP4 shRNA expression vector was constructed and transfected into HCC827 cells. Subsequently, the effects of PEBP4 on the cell viability, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis levels, and invasion properties of HCC827 cells were analyzed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, flow cytometry analyses, and transwell invasion assays. In addition, the effects of PEBP4 on the expression of proteins including cyclin D1, p53, Bcl-2, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were investigated. PEBP4 was highly expressed in lung cancer cells (HCC827, A549, NCI-H661, NCI-H292, and 95-D), but its expression was low in HBE cells. Cell viability, cell proliferation, and invasion of HCC827 cells in the PEBP4 knockdown group were significantly lower than that in the negative control and blank control groups (p < 0.05), and there were no significant differences between the negative and blank control groups in terms of cell viability, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion. In HCC827 cells, the expression levels of cyclin D1, Bcl-2, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in the PEBP4 knockdown group were significantly lower (p < 0.05), and the expression of p53 protein was significantly higher than that in the negative and blank control groups (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the negative and blank control groups in the expression levels of cyclin D1, p53, Bcl-2, MMP-2, and MMP-9. In conclusion, PEBP4 enhanced HCC827 cell proliferation and invasion ability and inhibited apoptosis. Decreased PEBP4 expression may play a role in the reduced invasion ability and increased apoptosis of the human NSCLC cell line HCC827. © 2012 International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).

The product is thoroughly characterized with the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), the thermogravimetric (TG) and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is found that chitosan is successfully grafted onto PBTNW. In addition, the water contact angles, hemolysis tests and cytotoxicity evaluation tests show an improvement in wettability and biocompatibility as a result of graft copolymerization of chitosan. So the CS-grafted PBTNW exhibits greater superiority than the original PBTNW. The CS-grafted PBTNW can be a candidate for blood filter materials and other medical applications. © right.

Owing to the decrease of the π conjugation length of biphenyl moiety in molecule structure, this carbazole derived derivative shows high triplet energy. Furthermore, the thermal, photophysical and electrochemical properties of 4,4-bis[3,6-bis(3,6-di- tert-butylcarbazol-9-yl)-carbazol-9-yl]-biphenyl were investigated. The high triplet energy of 4,4-bis[3,6-bis(3,6-di-tert-butylcarbazol-9-yl)-carbazol-9-yl] -biphenyl ensures efficient energy transfer from the host to the triplet emitter iridium(III) bis(4,6-difluorophenylpyridinato)picolinate.

Relative energies, equilibrium geometries, vibrational frequencies and electronic structures of monomer, dimer and one-dimensional (1D) chain of ethanol molecules adsorbed at the surface were investigated and analyzed. The calculations indicate that ethanol molecules prefer to adsorb at a top sites of the Pd (111) surface and the adsorption is exothermic. Adsorbed ethanol molecules are likely to form dimer and chain through the hydrogen bond interactions. The results also show that there are red shifts of n(O-H) frequencies for ethanol molecules adsorbed over the Pd (111) surface.

84876042998	The multisale model of the failure in SiC/IMI834 composites	Green's function and finite element methods were used to model the tensile test of metal matrix composites, and research the micro-stress distribution, macro-mechanical properties, and fiber failure in metal matrix composites. Finite element method was used to calculate the micro-stress field and stress transfer concentration factor for Green's function. Green's function was used to simulate the macroscopic failure process and mechanical properties in metal matrix composites. The results are shown that the stress recovery length in failure fiber depends on material properties, but is independent of the applied load. The axial stress in fiber along the failure surface diminishes as the distance from the failure fiber increases. However, the axial stress in matrix along the failure surface decreases as the distance from the failure fiber decreases. The macroscopic failure strain in SiC/IMI834 composites increases with the increasing of fiber volume fraction. However, the initial failure fiber in SiC/IMI834 composites has nothing to do with the fiber volume fraction.

Alloys with different microstructures were cut and ground into thin foils. The foils would be used to fabricate the SiC fibre reinforced composites via foil-fibre-foil method. Then, the matrix microstructures of composites were investigated by means of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and microarea X-ray diffraction. The results show that near lamellae and massive gamma microstructure transform into duplex during the consolidation process, but the transformation mechanism of the two microstructure is different. Fully lamellae microstructure remains in the matrix, while B2 phase precipitates in the matrix. Duplex microstructure does not change during the consolidation process. No matter what kind of microstructure the foils have, there is only gamma phase formed close to the fibres in the matrix of composites. © 2013 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

84879605949	Novel monofunctional platinum (II) complex Mono-Pt induces apoptosis-independent autophagic cell death in human ovarian carcinoma cells, distinct from cisplatin	Failure to engage apoptosis appears to be a leading mechanism of resistance to traditional platinum drugs in patients with ovarian cancer. Therefore, an alternative strategy to induce cell death is needed for the chemotherapy of this apoptosis-resistant cancer. Here we report that autophagic cell death, distinct from cisplatin-induced apoptosis, is triggered by a novel monofunctional platinum (II ) complex named Mono-Pt in human ovarian carcinoma cells. Mono-Ptinduced cell death has the following features: cytoplasmic vacuolation, caspase-independent, no nuclear fragmentation or chromatin condensation, and no apoptotic bodies. These characteristics integrally indicated that Mono-Pt, rather than cisplatin, initiated a nonapoptotic cell death in Caov-3 ovarian carcinoma cells. Furthermore, incubation of the cells with Mono-Pt but not with cisplatin produced an increasing punctate distribution of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), and an increasing ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I. Mono-Pt also caused the formation of autophagic vacuoles as revealed by monodansylcadaverine staining and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, Mono-Pt-induced cell death was significantly inhibited by the knockdown of either BECN1 or ATG7 gene expression, or by autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine, chloroquine and bafilomycin A1. Moreover, the effect of Mono-Pt involved the AKT1-MTOR-RPS6KB1 pathway and MAPK1 (ERK2)/MAPK3 (ERK1) signaling, since the MTOR inhibitor rapamycin increased, while the MAPK1/3 inhibitor U0126 decreased Mono-Pt-induced autophagic cell death. Taken together, our results suggest that Mono-Pt exerts anticancer effect via autophagic cell death in apoptosis-resistant ovarian cancer. These findings lead to increased options for anticancer platinum drugs to induce cell death in cancer. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

84883325980	Effect of early enteral nutrition on postoperative nutritional status, and immune function in elderly patients with esophageal cancer or cardiac cancer	Objective: To explore the effect of early enteral nutrition (EN) on postoperative nutritional status, intestinal permeability, and immune function in elderly patients with esophageal cancer or cardiac cancer. Methods: A total of 96 patients with esophageal cancer or cardiac cancer who underwent surgical treatment in our hospital from June 2007 to December 2010 were enrolled in this study. They were divided into EN group (n=50) and parenteral nutrition (PN) group (n=46) based on the nutrition support modes. The body weight, time to first flatus/defecation, average hospital stay, complications and mortality after the surgery as well as the liver function indicators were recorded and analyzed. Peripheral blood samples were collected on the days 1, 4 and 7 after surgery. The plasma diamine oxidase (DAO) activity and D-lactate level were determined to assess the intestinal permeability. The plasma endotoxin levels were determined using dynamic turbidimetric assay to assess the protective effect of EN on intestinal mucosal barrier. The postoperative blood levels of inflammatory cytokines and immunoglobulins were determined using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: After the surgery, the time to first flatus/defecation, average hospital stay, and complications were significantly less in the EN group than those in the PN group (P<0.05), whereas the EN group had significantly higher albumin levels than the PN group (P<0.05). On the 7th postoperative day, the DAO activity, D-lactate level and endotoxin contents were significantly lower in the EN group than those in the PN group (all P<0.05). In addition, the EN group had significantly higher IgA, IgG, IgM, and CD4 levels than the PN group (P<0.05) but significantly lower IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α levels (P<0.05). Conclusions: In elderly patients with esophageal cancer or cardiac cancer, early EN after surgery can effectively improve the nutritional status, protect intestinal mucosal barrier (by reducing plasma endotoxins), and enhance the immune function. © Chinese Journal of Cancer Research.

84883539062	In-situ TEM investigation of fracture process in an Al-Cu-Mg alloy	The deformation and fracture process in Al-Cu-Mg alloy were investigated by using the in situ straining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) method. Some major aspects of the fracture process, including dislocation emission and migration, thinning of dislocation free zone (DFZ), crack propagation (both in continuous and discontinuous manners) and slipping/twinning deformation, can be observed. The rod-like T dispersoids, which may increase the microcrack initiation sensitivity, also can effectively prevent the fast and continuous propagation of the crack. DFZ ahead of crack tip can be thinned in a mixed mode characterized by tearing and shear deformation, while nanovoids, which are typical characteristics in DFZ during discontinuous crack propagation, may originate from the enrichment of defects such as dislocations and vacancies. Deformation twinning at crack tip can slow down crack propagation and change crack propagation path, thus may be beneficial to the fracture toughness of the alloy. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84883553490	Microstructure and thermal residual stress analysis of SiC fiber through Raman spectroscopy	SiC fiber-reinforced metal matrix composite is an interesting material for aerospace industry because of its excellent properties. However, these properties are greatly influenced by fiber microstructure and thermal residual stresses introduced by the preparation of the composites. Due to complicated preparation technology, microstructure and thermal stress along SiC fiber radius varies, which makes characterization difficult. Raman spectroscopy is a non-destructive technique which provides information, at micrometer scale, on the phase composition and the crystalline state (structure and texture) of materials. Line scanning was used to assess microstructure along SiC fiber radius embedded in Ti64. The SiC coating is subdivided into three concentric parts across the fiber diameter, according to the differences in intensity and width of SiC transverse optical phonon (TO) band. Part 2 is considered to be a buffer zone connecting Part 1 and Part 3 with different deposition conditions, respectively. Amorphous Si is detected throughout fiber radius, while crystalline Si is only detected in the outer part. Thermal residual stress along fiber radius in the composite was calculated by using SiC TO band shifts with a bare fiber as reference. A cylindrical model was also used to compare with the stress data obtained from Raman shift. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Mechanical properties of CVD-SiC fiber are greatly influenced by fiber microstructure and thermal residual stresses introduced by the preparation of the composites. Microstructure and thermal residual stress along SiC fiber radius varies, which makes characterization difficult. Our Raman results indicate that SiC and Si grain size, defects and thermal residual stress varies along fiber radius, meanwhile a buffer zone connecting different SiC coatings processed in separate reactors in fiber is found.

The impact fracture surface of PP/SF composites and the interfacial compatibility between PP and SF were analysed. Experimental results showed that the impact strength and flexural strength of PP/SF composites modified with the CTHP (2 wt-% of SF) were 21·5 and 9·7% higher than that of unmodified systems respectively. The SEM photomicrographs of the fracture surfaces have also shown that PP was highly bonded to the SF in the CTHP treated composites; wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurement indicated that the CTHP did not change the crystal structure of PP and was still a-type crystal. Moreover, the addition of a small amount of the CTHP was helpful to improve water resistance of SF/LGF/PP composites. © 2013 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining 2013 Published by Maney on behalf of the Institute.

Owing to the non-planar structures, which decrease the π conjugation length of fluorene and benzimidazole rings, these fluorene derived derivatives show high triplet energy. The high triplet energy of newly host materials ensures efficient energy transfer from the host to the triplet emitter tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium. Furthermore, the thermal, photophysical, electrochemical properties and crystal structures of 1-(9,9-diphenyl-9H-fluorene-2-yl)-2-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole and 1-(9,9′-spirobifluorene-2-yl)-2-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole were investigated.

Our results show that the main effect of oxalic acid electrolyte is to enhance the growth rate, with little effect on pore size and inter pore distance distributions. High electrolyte concentration could also promote the branched growth of AAO during a voltage lowering process, which opens new avenue for the fabrication of new types of nanostructured channels.

Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the adsorption of XeF and XeBeO on metal doped graphene sheet are dissociation adsorption modes due to their high dipole moment. The density of states (DOS) results and the electronic density difference image indicate that the xenon complexes were strongly adsorbed on metal doped graphene by orbital hybridization, but no evidences for the hybridization between xenon complexes and intrinsic graphene sheet.

It is demonstrated that the α-WC(0001) surface models with more than nine atom-layers exhibit bulk-like interior, wherein the surface relaxations localized within the top three layers are well converged. Twenty-four specific geometry models of SiC/WC interface structures with different terminations and stacking sites were chosen. The calculated work of adhesion and interface energy suggest that the most stable interface structure has the C-C bonding across the interface, yielding the largest work of adhesion and the lowest interface energy. Moreover, the top-site stacking sequence is preferable for the C/C-terminated interface. The effects of the interface on the electronic structures of the C/C-terminated interfaces are mainly localized within the first and second layers of the interface. Calculations of the work of adhesion and interface energy provide theoretical evidence that the mechanical failure may initiate at the interface or in SiC but not in WC. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

With increasing Al-Si content, the size of TiC grains decreased. No pores and cracks were present at the interface between the Al-Si matrix and the reinforced regions. Wear resistance of the locally reinforced regions is significantly improved compared with that of the Al-Si matrix. © 2013 The American Ceramic Society.

84905380553	Influence of equal-channel angular pressing on aging precipitation in 7050 Al alloy	7050 Al alloy was successfully processed by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) at room temperature (RT). The effect of ECAP on the subsequent aging precipitation behavior was investigated by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The results reveal that the kinds, spatial distribution and sizes of precipitates in the unECAPed and the ECAPed samples are different. ECAP accelerates the process of aging precipitation and results in the broadening of precipitate size distribution. ECAP can produce not only deformation heat but also internal defects such as excess vacancies and high density of dislocations when the sample passes through the main deformation zone. Deformation heat can lead to pre-precipitation, forming a small amount of GPII zones during ECAP processing. Strain-induced excess vacancies make solute segregation along dislocations by the mechanism of nonequilibrium segregation. High density dislocations mainly accelerate the process of aging precipitation. Besides, dislocations also induce the competition between homogeneous precipitation and heterogeneous precipitation on dislocations due to the flow of solutes and vacancies towards dislocations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

0346617853	Metastable phases of Al-Fe system by mechanical alloying	The preparation and characterization of metastable phases of the Al-Fe alloy system by mechanical alloying are reported. In Al-rich (up to 10 at.% Fe) alloys, the supersaturated f.c.c. solid solution of Fe in Al (up to 1 at.% Fe) is formed. Almost complete amorphization is confirmed in the composition range 17-33 at.% Fe. The metastable disordered b.c.c. solid solution of about 10 nm in grain size has also been formed by ball-milling for over 180 h in Fe-rich (above 50 at.% Fe) alloys. Examination of lattice parameter and magnetization have shown that the composition range and degree of disorder are comparable to those formed by crushing and sputter deposition. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.

84921068366	Systematic investigation on determining chemical diffusion coefficients of lithium ion in Li<inf>1 + x</inf>VPO<inf>4</inf>F (0 ≤ x ≤ 2)	The chemical diffusion coefficients of lithium ion (D<inf>Li</inf><sup>+</sup>) in Li<inf>1 + x</inf>VPO<inf>4</inf>F (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) between 3.0 and 0.01 V are systematically analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). The results indicate that the D<inf>Li</inf><sup>+</sup> values depend heavily on the voltage state. Based on the results from EIS and GITT, the diffusion coefficients (D<inf>Li</inf><sup>+</sup>) measured in a single-phase region below 1.7 V have relatively steady values of about 10<sup>−9</sup> (EIS) and 10<sup>−10</sup> (GITT) cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, while the D<inf>Li</inf><sup>+</sup> values in the single-phase region above 1.9 V decrease rapidly from 10<sup>−9</sup> to 10<sup>−11</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> due to concentration of lithium ions in the bulk LiVPO<inf>4</inf>F. The Li<sup>+</sup> chemical diffusion coefficients measured in the two-phase region by GITT range a lot from 10<sup>−9</sup> to 10<sup>−14</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, while the D<inf>Li</inf><sup>+</sup> values in the two-phase region determined by CV are around 10<sup>−10</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. By the GITT, the D<inf>Li</inf><sup>+</sup> values in the two-phase region vary in non-linear shape with the charge–discharge voltage, which is ascribed to strong interactions of Li<sup>+</sup> with other ions.

84922392884	Downregulation of PEBP4, a target of miR-34a, sensitizes drug-resistant lung cancer cells	The aim of this study was to determine the relationship and underlying mechanisms between ectopic expression of phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 4 (PEBP4) and cisplatin (DDP)-induced cytotoxicity in the lung cancer cell line A549 to provide an experimental basis for future chemotherapeutic applications involving PEBP4 in human lung cancer. A recombinant plasmid, pcDNA3-PEBP4, and a PEBP4-targeting small hairpin RNA (shRNA) were transfected into the lung cancer cell line A549. The PEBP4 protein expression levels were determined for each group by Western blot, and after 48 h of cisplatin (DDP) treatment, the viability of cells in the treatment and control groups was determined by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-3,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis in each treatment group was determined using flow cytometry.Western blotting was used to examine expression of the p53 protein in A549 cells from each group. We employed a luciferase reportergene assay to confirm PEBP4 as a target gene of miR-34a. Western blotting was used to determine the effects ofmiR-34a on PEBP4 protein expression in A549 cells. Following transfection of A549 cells with either the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3-PEBP4 or a PEBP4-targeting shRNA,Western blotting analyses showed PEBP4 protein expression was significantly higher in the pcDNA3-PEBP4-transfected group compared with the control or PEBP4-shRNA-transfected groups (p<0.01). Furthermore, PEBP4 protein expression was significantly reduced in the PEBP4-shRNA-transfected group (p<0.01). After 48 h of DDP treatment, MTTassays indicated that A549 cell viability was significantly lower in the DDPtreated group compared with the control group (p<0.01). The viability of A549 cells in the pcDNA3-PEBP4-transfected group was lower than that in the control group (p<0.05) but higher than that in either the DDP-treated or PEBP4-shRNAtransfected groups (p<0.05). Moreover, the viability of A549 cells in the PEBP4-shRNA-transfected group was significantly lower than that in either the control (p<0.01) or DDPtreated (p<0.05) groups. Flow cytometry andWestern blotting analyses indicated that the number of apoptotic cells and p53 protein expression were significantly higher in the DDPtreated group compared with the control group (p<0.01). In the pcDNA3-PEBP4-transfected group, the number of apoptotic cells and p53 protein expression level were higher than those in the control group (p<0.05) but lower than those in the DDP-treated and PEBP4-shRNA-transfected groups (p<0.05). The number of apoptotic cells and p53 protein expression level in the PEBP4-shRNA-transfected group were higher than those in the control (p<0.01) and DDP-treated (p<0.05) groups. The luciferase reporter-gene assay showed that the relative luciferase activity after transfection with a miR-34a mimic was significantly reduced compared with the control group (p<0.01).Western blotting analysis demonstrated that PEBP4 protein expression was significantly decreased in A549 cells 48 h after transfection with a miR-34a mimic compared with the control group (p<0.01). In conclusion, overexpression of PEBP4 reduced the sensitivity of A549 cells to DDP-induced cytotoxicity, mainly through the altered expression of the p53 protein or the modulation of miR-34a.
