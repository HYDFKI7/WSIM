84938896429	The dynamics detection and processing method for preventing large displacement transducer damage problem	The method for avoiding the large displacement damage problem of the transducer diaphragm is presented in this study. To account for the displacement and supply current, a set of transduction equations with parameters for the receiver is established. The numerical solver is used to obtain the displacement values from the transduction equations of transducer, and then limit the peak of the current and coil velocity by using the dynamics limiter. Once the peak limited process is done, the safe input voltage can be obtained satisfactory for preventing the impulse damage of displacement. The numerical and experimental results indicate that the proposed method features high efficiency and ability applied in the wide application of transducers. Tsai and Haung Loudspeaker Displacement Limiter are necessary in the operation of this model. For instance, electrical inductance Le and electrical resistance Re are needed in the magnet system, whereas mechanical mass Mm, mechanical stiffness Km, mechanical resistance Rm, and force factor Bl are needed in the vibration and suspension systems. There are many methods used in measuring these electromechanical parameters.

8844220618	Design and optimization of piezoelectric-actuated torsion mirror with lever mechanisms	Considering with high frequency response and self-detection function, a torsion mirror is designed by using piezoelectric material. For large rotating angle requirement, the torsion mirror contains a mechanism with four levers. The torsion mirror is rotating due to actuated by reflection of a piezoelectric beam deposing on the structure layer. The structure layer connects to the lever mechanism. The lever mechanism has four levers. Three levers enlarge the rotating angles by the different ratio of apply and resist moment arms lengths. The fourth lever has the same apply and resist moment arms lengths to adjust the rotating direction the same as deflection of piezoelectric-actuated beam. For self-detecting rotating angle, another additional beam with piezoelectric material depositing is attached to the mirror plate. Finite element method is used to analyze. To investigate the effect of piezoelectric actuated beam on rotating angle, the results show when the actuated beam has length and width of 300 and 24 μm, the thickness structure and piezoelectric actuation layers are both 1 μm, and the applied voltage is 10 volts, the maximum rotating angles could be 50.4 degree. In this rotating angle, the sensing voltage is 170 volts by the piezoelectric material beam attached to mirror plate. Therefore, the torsion mirror can rotate to large angle and have high resolution of angle sensing. To investigate the effect of ratio of apply and resist moment arms lengths on rotating angle. A maximum value is obtained. To optimize the ratio of apply and resist moment arms lengths, the structure of the torsion mirror with piezoelectric actuated beam being 100 and 8 μm long and wide is investigated. The thickness of structure and piezoelectric actuation layers are both 1 μm. And the applied voltage is 10 volts. It shows that the rotating angle increases nonlinearly as the ratio of apply and resist moment arms lengths increasing. And when the rotating angle reaches the maximum values, the rotating angle decreases fast as the ratio of apply and resist moment arms lengths increasing to 1. The maximum rotating angle is 22.71 degrees and the corresponding ratio of apply and resist moment arms lengths is 46/54. Theoretical analysis is derived and has similar tendency.

16244362050	Boundary element method interior stress/ strain analysis for two-dimensional static thermoelasticity involving nonuniform volume heat sources	In the elastostatics analysis of the boundary element method, strains at interior points of an elastic body are calculated using the respective Somigliana identity after the boundary integral equation is solved for boundary displacements and tractions. In the presence of a nonuniform volume heat source, an extra line integral depending on the spatial location of the source point will appear in the boundary integral equation for displacements. Therefore, the usual spatial differentiations of the boundary integral equation for displacements will not yield proper strains if the source point is inside the domain. Somigliana's identity is derived for the interior strains in an anisotropic medium loaded with a nonuniform volume heat source. By coupling the associated thermal field with elasticity, this work provides an alternative and effective numerical approach of analyzing the interior thermal stresses in a fully anisotropic medium loaded with arbitrary nonuniform volume heat sources.

16344382727	Effect of film thickness on the structure and properties of nanocrystalline ZrN thin films produced by ion plating	Nanocrystalline ZrN thin films were successfully deposited on Si (100) and AISI 316 stainless steel (316SS) substrates using a hollow cathode discharge ion plating (HCD-IP) method. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of film thickness on the composition, structure and mechanical properties of the ZrN films. The results showed that (111) was the dominant preferred orientation. The effect of the film thickness was significant on the N/Zr ratio, roughness, grain size and electrical resistivity. The packing factor was only slightly varied with film thickness; and the thinnest specimen, at a ZrN thickness of 160 nm, reached a quite high packing factor of 0.8. Nanoindentation data indicated that hardness of the films was not related to the film texture or residual stress. Since the grain sizes of ZrN films were less than 20 nm, the dislocation pileup or Hall-Petch hardening was not expected to active. The deformation mechanisms of the nanocrystalline ZrN films may be due to grain rotation or grain boundary sliding, instead of a dislocation slip mechanism. The residual stresses of all ZrN films were compressive, and did not vary with film thickness. The residual stress of the ZrN films deposited on Si is lower than that on AISI 316 stainless steel. This may be due to the differences in electrical conductivities and thermal expansion coefficients between Si and 316 stainless steel. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0000149503	The analysis of piezoelectric/piezomagnetic composite materials containing ellipsoidal inclusions	A unified method based on the inclusion formulation is proposed to determine the magnetic, electric, and elastic fields in a composite with piezoelectric and piezomagnetic phases. The composite reinforcements are treated as ellipsoidal inclusions that enable the reinforcement geometries ranging from thin flakes to continuous fibers. Utilizing the proposed method, the magneto-electro-elastic tensors analogous to Eshelby tensors for elastic ellipsoidal inclusions are obtained. With these tensors, the magnetic, electric, and elastic fields around the inclusion as well as concentration factors are determined. Furthermore, based upon the Mori-Tanaka mean-field theory [Acta Metall. 21, 571 (1973)] to account for the interaction between inclusions and matrix, the effective magneto-electro-elastic constants (elastic moduli, piezoelectric coefficients, dielectric constants, piezomagnetic coefficients, magnetoelectric, and magnetic permeability) of the composites are expressed explicitly in terms of phase properties, volume fraction, and inhomogeneity shape.

The plates consist of a combination of fiber-reinforced composite laminates and piezoelectric layers and the response quantities of the plates are coupled by the mechanical field and the electric field. The theory, based on the three-dimensional linear piezoelectricity, assumes that the fundamental unknowns such as the displacement components and the electric potential can be expanded through the plate thickness coordinate. The governing equations are obtained in terms of the displacement and electric potential coefficients. Numerical studies of single piezoelectric layer plate and a nine-layered hybrid plate show that the proposed method is accurate to predict the response quantities for both mechanical and electric loading cases.

0000629867	Kinetics of stress relaxation caused by the combination of interfacial sliding and diffusion: Two-dimensional analysis	The kinetics of stress relaxation due to the combined action of sliding and diffusion on the matrix-inclusion interface has been examined in a material containing inclusions. The interaction between the inclusions is taken into account by the average field method. The sliding rate is connected to a tangential traction, and the normal displacement jump rate due to the diffusion is written in terms of the distribution of a normal traction. These tractions are also determined by the amount of sliding and diffusion. The strain due to the relaxation consists of two parts, each having the form of a first-order reaction. The relaxation strength and time of both terms depend on the interfacial viscosity and diffusivity, i.e. the sliding and diffusion are coupled. This is because the sliding induces the normal traction and the diffusion the tangential traction. The Coble creep is examined as an extreme case of the inclusion volume fraction approaching unity. The role of boundary sliding is emphasized in the Coble creep. © 1998 Acta Metallurgica Inc.

0030111785	Equivalent inclusion method for the work-hardening behavior of piezoelectric composites	The work-hardening behavior of piezoelectric composites is investigated by utilizing the variational principle and the equivalent inclusion method. When the matrix of a piezoelectric composite subjected to a uniaxial tension is perfectly plastic and the piezoelectric inhomogeneities are elastic, the linear work-hardening rate is predicted. In particular, when both the matrix and the inhomogeneities of the piezoelectric material are transversely isotropic with different electroelastic moduli, and shapes of the inhomogeneities are elliptical, ribbon-like, rod-shaped and penny-shaped, the yielding stress and the work-hardening rate are obtained in closed forms. The results show that the work-hardening rate is proportional to the volume fraction of the inhomogeneities. Moreover, it is found that the work-hardening rate and the yielding stress are dependent on the shape and the volume fraction of the inhomogeneities but are independent on the size of the inhomogeneities.

With these tensors, analytical expressions for the electroelastic fields of the piezoelectric composite are easily followed. Finally, based on the Mori-Tanaka mean field to account for interaction at finite concentrations of inhomogeneities, the effective electroelastic moduli (elastic, piezoelectric, and dielectric constants) of the composite material are expressed analytically in terms of phase properties, volume fraction, and inhomogeneities' shape. The results show that the proposed method yields the same effective electroelastic moduli for the cases when either a traction-electric displacement or an elastic displacement-electric field is prescribed on the boundary of the composite.

0030190473	On the thermoelastic field in a composite material with inhomogeneities	This paper concerns ellipsoidal inclusion problems in a three-dimensional composite material subjected to a far-field uniform heat flow. The eigenstrain formulation is developed to examine the thermoelastic field that results from two sources: one induced by the inclusion of thermal properties alone, and the other intensified by the inhomogeneity of elastic material constants. When the thermal conductivity and the thermal expansion coefficient of the inclusion are different from those of the surrounding matrix, the eigenstrain is utilized to simulate the thermal expansion strain and thermal expansion mismatch strain, respectively. It is shown that the eigenstrain is a homogeneous function of first degree, and the resulting thermoelastic field inside the ellipsoidal inclusion is therefore a homogeneous function of first degree. With these results in hand, the equivalent inclusion method is further employed to obtain the total thermoelastic field in the inhomogeneity which has elastic constants differing from those of the matrix.

The tensors provide the basis for analysis of the magneto-electro-elastic response of the composites and have numerous applications such as to the study of defects, overall properties of multiphase composites, and fracture mechanics, etc. For a three-dimensional transversely isotropic piezoelectric/piezomagnetic composite containing spheriodal inclusions, the number of nonzero Eshelby tensors is 41 while among them only 17 are independent. These independent tensors can be divided into three categories. The first category consists of those tensors related to the elastic response, the second involves those related to the piezomagnetic response, while the third includes elastic and magnetic interactive terms. Moreover, the magneto-electro-elastic Eshelby tensors are obtained in the closed forms when both constituents of the composite are transversely isotropic and shapes of the inclusion are elliptic, rod shaped, penny shaped, and ribbon like. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.

The problems covered range from the derivation of the analytical expressions for the magneto-electro-elastic Eshelby tensors to the analysis of the magnetoelectric coupling effect which is a new property exhibited in the piezoelectric-piezomagnetic composite. In particular, when both the matrix and the inclusions of the composite are transversely isotropic with different magneto-electro-elastic moduli, and shapes of inclusions are of elliptic cylinder, circular cylinder, disk, and ribbon, closed-form solutions for the magnetoelectric coupling coefficients are presented compactly. The resulting solutions are a function of the shape of inclusion, phase properties, and volume fraction of the inclusions. These results could provide us with insight into how a piezoelectric-piezomagnetic composite material consisting of inclusions will perform and would be helpful in understanding the magneto-electric-elastic behavior of the composite.

0031077528	Stress relaxation by plastic flow, interfacial sliding and diffusion in an inclusion bearing material	Stress relaxation, a decrease of energy by plastic flow, interfacial sliding, local diffusion and bulk diffusion, has been studied for an inclusion bearing material. The complete relaxed state is found by minimizing the total energy, using a variational method. A relaxation process or the combination of two processes imposes a subsidiary condition that matches the physics of the process. The complete relaxation occurs when total stresses are uniformly hydrostatic in a plastic region. In interface-related phenomena, the complete relaxed state is as follows: tangential traction vanishes for interfacial sliding; normal traction is constant for local diffusion; and total traction is constant and normal to the interface for the combination of interfacial sliding and diffusion. When bulk diffusion is allowed, normal traction vanishes. If sliding is further allowed, an inclusion becomes stress free. By examining subsidiary conditions, the effectiveness of two processes can be compared. Copyright © 1997 Acta Metallurgica Inc.

0031192583	A fracture criterion of a penny-shaped crack in transversely isotropic piezoelectric media	By utilizing the eigenstrain formulation and Cauchy's residue theorem, a unified explicit expression for the electroelastic fields inside a flat ellipsoidal crack embedded in an infinite piezoelectric solid subjected to electromechanical loads is presented. In particular, an explicit expression is obtained for a penny-shaped crack in a transversely isotropic piezoelectric medium. Three loading cases, a simple tension, a pure shear, and an electric displacement, have been considered to examine the behavior of penny-shaped cracking. The results show that the applied shear stress does not couple with the electric displacement, unlike the simple tension case. Furthermore, the change of potential energy due to the presence of the crack is evaluated. With this result and based on the Griffith theory, the fracture stresses and critical electric displacement are presented in closed forms. Explicit expressions for stress and electric displacement intensity factors are also given. It is verified that the resulting fracture stresses and stress intensity factors can be reduced to those for uncoupled linear elastic fracture mechanics when piezoelectric coupling is absent and the material is isotropic. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The eigenstrain method has been used to obtain the elastic fields around the inclusion and the interaction energy between the inclusion and applied loads. Through the equivalent inclusion method, the resulting elastic fields are further utilized in the solution of a flat ellipsoidal crack in an anisotropic body by taking the elastic moduli of the inclusion as zero. As a result, the critical stresses of the Griffith criterion for fracture are obtained in closed forms for different loading directions by minimizing the resulting interaction energy. Numerical results have been given to the critical stresses of an elliptical crack in a cubic material subjected to a uniaxial tension, an in-plane shear, and an out-of-plane shear, respectively. Finally, an analytical approach to determine the crack opening displacements for different loading directions are also presented.

For InGaAs/GaAs MQWs with strained InGaAs wells, upon annealing at 500 and 600 °C, arsenic precipitates tend to be completely confined in InGaAs wells near the InGaAs/GaAs interfaces, resulting in dual two-dimensional planes of precipitates in each InGaAs well. In contrast, this strong confinement of precipitates does not exist in InGaAs/GaAs MQWs with partially or totally strain-relieved InGaAs wells and in unstrained AlGaAs/GaAs MQWs. The present results suggest that the As precipitation process in strained GaAs-based MQWs is not only driven by the bond strength in different materials, but also by the lattice-mismatch-induced strain. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The resin is described as a viscoelastic material using two models: Maxwell model and three-element standard solid model.

The "stick-slip" mechanism is proposed to describe the load transfer behavior between a nanorope and a sheath and between individual SWNTs.

It is illustrated that the "stick-slip" friction is the main contribution for the total loss factor of CNT-based composites even with a small amount of nanotubes/ropes.

34047247192	Influence of catalyst oxidation on the growth of nitrogen-containing carbon nanotubes for energy generation and storage applications	The importance of catalytic oxidation effect on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as evidenced from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and surface morphology studies is reported. The correlation reveals that the packing densities of the CNTs grown by oxidized Fe catalysts are denser than grown by elemental Fe catalysts. The function of catalyst oxidation treatment is to prevent the reaction of Fe catalysts with the Ti-buffer layer, thereby providing well-dispersed Fe nanoparticles for the growth of uniform CNTs. The closely packed CNTs grown on Ti-buffered Si are promising for energy generation/storage device applications. © 2007.

34250675251	Post-buckling analysis of functionally graded rectangular plates	The post-buckling response of the functionally graded materials plate, subjected to thermal and mechanical loadings, is obtained analytically, using fast converging finite double Chebyshev polynomials. A functionally graded plate made of aluminum and alumina is considered for different kinds of boundary conditions. The volume fraction of the material constituents follows a simple power law distribution. The mathematical formulation is based on the first-order shear deformation theory and von-Karman nonlinear kinematics. Numerical results indicate that the critical temperature and buckling loads decrease with increase in volume fraction exponent of the FGM plate. It is observed that effect of the volume fraction exponent k up to 2 on the buckling and post-buckling response of the plate is more significant. The effects of plate aspect ratio on the post-buckling response of the plate for different volume fraction of the constituents of the materials are presented. It is observed that the buckling load and post-buckling response of the FGM plate is almost same for a plate aspect ratio more than or equal to 3. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34848919168	Electromechanical analysis for a piezo-optical fiber subjected to harmonic loading	This article investigates the electromechanical responses of a piezocoated optical fiber subjected to time-harmonic excitation of mechanical load as a sensor or to electric voltages as an actuator. Piezoelectric coatings, functioning as sensors or actuators, have potential in the development of acousto-optic devices. Despite the growing demand for optical fibers coated with piezoelectric materials, pertinent research work on their electromechanical responses in integrated systems still remains very scarce indeed. By application of Hamilton's principle to piezoelectric fundamentals, the equations of motion under dynamic excitations are solved with proper boundary conditions to give the analytical forms of the integrated system's electromechanical responses. For numerical illustration of the responses, an example is investigated to give the instantaneous response for the direct and converse effects. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

The Mori-Tanaka theory is also applied to determine the overall stress-strain relation of inclusions embedded in a matrix, regardless of whether the matrix is isotropic, cubic, or transversely isotropic material. Our analysis results indicate that the overall elastic moduli of a composite are a function of a matrix's elastic moduli, inclusion elastic moduli, inclusion Eshelby tensor (depending on the aspect ratio of the inclusion), and inclusion volume fraction. In addition, the equivalent inclusion method is employed to model the voids of porous materials as inclusions in which the elastic moduli are nulls.

0033204115	Failure criteria for multiply flawed anisotropic materials	This study presents overall failure criteria for an infinite anisotropic solid containing multiple flaws subjected to a set of uniform applied loads. Based on the inclusion method, flaws are treated as elliptical inclusions where their elastic moduli are considered to be zero. The explicit expression of elastic fields is obtained for a cubic crystal multiply flawed solid through the use of the Mori-Tanaka mean field theory. The resulting expression is further utilized to find an interaction energy function between the applied loads and flaws. With this energy function, the energy release rates and critical stresses are acquired separately in a closed form for Mode I, II, and III. The closed forms for energy release rates and critical stresses reveal that they are a function of the aspect ratio and the volume fraction of flaws, the modes of the loading, and the material properties. As an illustrated numerical example, the energy release rates and the critical stresses that vary with both the aspect ratio and the volume fraction of the flaws in a cubic crystal material are discussed.

0033715496	On a piezoelectric material containing a permeable elliptical crack	This study presents the failure criteria for a permeable crack embedded in an infinite piezoelectric solid, which is separately subjected to a set of uniform electromechanical loads. Based on the equivalent inclusion method, a permeable crack is treated as an elliptical inclusion where its elastic moduli and piezoelectric constants are considered to be zero, while the dielectric constants remain finite. In addition, the interaction between the crack and the applied electromechanical loading is examined by introducing the change of total potential energy function. With this energy function, the energy release rates and the critical loads for fracture are acquired separately in a closed form for a simple tension, in-plane and out-plane shears, and normal electric flux density applied. The closed forms for energy release rate and critical electromechanical loading reveal that they are a function of the aspect ratio of the elliptical crack, the type of the electromechanical loading, and the piezoelectric properties. Moreover, analysis results indicate that the distinct electric fields can retard the dilation of the elliptical crack, particularly for an in-plane electric field incited in perpendicular to the crack faces. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0033751944	The optimized fiber volume fraction for magnetoelectric coupling effect in piezoelectric-piezomagnetic continuous fiber reinforced composites	Explicit formulae are presented to assess the optimized fiber volume fraction for maximum magnetoelectric coupling effect exhibiting in the composite with piezomagnetic matrix reinforced by piezoelectric continuous fibers. The formulae consist of the analytical expressions for the effective properties of the composite and the magneto-electro-elastic Eshelby tensors. With these expressions, the closed-form solution for the magnetoelectric coupling effect, which is a new property existing in the piezoelectric-piezomagnetic composite even though neither of the individual phases exhibits such a property, is acquired. Furthermore, by taking the derivative of the close form for magnetoelectric coupling effect with respect to the fiber volume fraction as zero yields the optimized volume fraction of fibers analytically. The optimized fiber volume fraction shows that it is a function of the elastic properties of constituents, but not a function of the magnetic and electric properties. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0033881691	Critical volume fraction of multiple cracks for fracture in piezoelectric media	This paper concerns an infinite piezoelectric solid containing multiple penny-shaped cracks subjected to a set of uniform electromechanical loads. Based on the eigenstrain formulation, the crack is treated as an inclusion by taking the electroelastic moduli of the inclusion as zero. The Mori-Tanaka theory is employed to account for the effects of crack interaction at finite concentration through the use of electroelastic Eshelby tensors. By using this theory, the averaging electroelastic field and the effective electroelastic moduli of the piezoelectric cracked body are expressed explicitly. Furthermore, an interaction energy density function is introduced to take the interaction between electromechanical loads and cracks into account. With this interaction energy density function, the critical volume fraction of multiple cracks for fracture is obtained for a simple tension, a pure shear, and a normal electric displacement, separately. The resulting critical volume fraction is a function of the geometrical dimension of the crack length, electromechanical loading, and the piezoelectric properties of the surrounding matrix.

The linear work-hardening rate is forecast with the composite matrix perfectly plastic and the fibers (inhomogeneities) plastically nondeforming. Notably, when both the matrix and inhomogeneities are transversely isotropic with different elastic moduli, the yielding stress and the work-hardening rate are obtained in closed forms with the shapes of the inhomogeneities being elliptical, ribbon-like, rod-shaped, and penny-shaped. The results of the study show that the work-hardening rate is proportional to the volume fraction of the inhomogeneities. Meanwhile, the work-hardening rate and the yielding stress are dependent on the shape and the volume fraction of the inhomogeneities but not on the size of the inhomogeneities.

33645686892	Effects of interfacial friction on the damping characteristics of composites containing randomly oriented carbon nanotube ropes	This article presents a model for describing the damping characteristics of uniaxially stressed polymeric composites filled with randomly oriented single-wall nanotube (SWNT) ropes. A close-packed lattice consisting of seven nanotubes in hexagonal array is used to present the nanoropes. The composite is described as a three-phase system composed of a resin, a resin sheath acting as a shear transfer zone, and SWNT ropes. The concept of 'stick-slip' motion caused by frictional contacts is proposed to describe the load transfer behavior between individual nanotubes and between a nanotube rope and a sheath. The results of the analytical study show that both the Young's modulus and the loss factor of the composite are sensitive to stress magnitude. Also, to show the inter-tube sliding effects due to nanotube aggregation, the Young's moduli and the loss factors of composites filled with aligned SWNTs, aligned nanoropes, and randomly oriented nanoropes are compared. © 2006 SAGE Publications.

Methods: The assembly process was hypothesized to occur via an orchestrated proteolytic processing of the P1 precursor by the viral protease 3CD. To test this hypothesis, we constructed 3 recombinant baculoviruses: Bac-P1 expressing P1; Bac-3CD expressing 3CD; and Bac-P1-3CD co-expressing P1 and 3CD. Results: Both single infection by Bac-P1-3CD and co-infection by Bac-P1 and Bac-3CD resulted in correct cleavage of P1 to yield individual proteins VP0, VP1 and VP3, while the former approach yielded higher VLP production. In the cells, the structural proteins self-assembled into clusters of virus-like particles (VLP) resembling the authentic EV71 particle aggregates. After ultracentrifugation purification, the dispersed VLPs were indistinguishable from the authentic virus in size, appearance, composition and surface epitopes, as determined by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, transmission electron microscopy and immunogold labeling. Conclusion: Our data, for the first time, suggest that in insect cells EV71 structural proteins adopt a processing and assembly pathway similar to poliovirus assembly. The preservation of particle morphology and composition suggest that the VLP may be a valuable vaccine candidate to prevent EV71 epidemics. © 2006 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

40749160482	Retrospective analysis of antibacterial agents utilization in 64 cases of acute pancreatitis	Objective: To analyze the utilization of antibacterial agents in the patients with acute pancreatitis and compare with the standard therapeutic guidelines issued by several countries. Methods: The medical records of 64 inpatients, of whom 35 were diagnosed as severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and 29 as mild acute pancreatitis (MAP), were randomly collected from January 1 to December 31,2006, in Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University. The data were studied and analyzed in terms of varieties of drugs, frequency of use, combination regimen, therapeutic duration, etiologic diagnosis, therapeutic effectiveness and cost. Results: The cephalosporins and the cephalosporins/enzyme inhibitor combined with metronidazole were the first choice of treatment regimen for SAP, and the quinolones combined with metronidazole were the main treatment for MAP. Etiologic diagnosis reports were first obtained in (14 ± 6. 36) d for bacteria and (10.5 ± 10.73) d for fungi after admission. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were the main pathogenic bacteria. Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis were the main fungi identified. The average duration of use of antibacterials were (19.27 ± 13.78) d for SAP and (8.31 ± 4.87) d for MAP. Mean cost of antibacterials per person was 10 951.08 yuan for SAP and 1 053.71 yuan for MAP. Conclusion: Compared with the therapeutic guidelines abroad and at home, there are similar types of antibacterial agents and therapeutic regimens selected and similar effective rate in the patients with SAP, but there are still some problems in the treatment of MAP, such as drug administration with no indication and overuse of antibacterials. The difficulty and complexity of the treatment of SAP are increased with the change of spectrum of pathogens, the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and secondary infection of fungi. Standard therapeutic guidelines still need to be improved to provide reference for clinical use in order to increase the curative rate and decrease the mortality of complicated infection.

Based on the three-dimensional linear piezoelectricity, the fundamental unknowns such as the displacements and the electric potential are assumed to be expandable through the plate thickness coordinate. The dynamic electromechanical responses of the plate are expressed in terms of Fourier coefficients. When the boundary conditions and electromechanical inputs are specified, the unknown Fourier coefficients can be determined explicitly. In terms of analyzing a vibrating PIC-151 piezoelectric plate, numerical results of the proposed formulation correlate well with results in previous literature regarding frequencies. Analysis results also indicate that the plate size, thickness, and electroelastic constants influence dynamic response.

The resulting moduli are able to elucidate the effect of fiber shape on the composite elastic behavior, thus applicable to a much wider range of composite microstructural geometry. From these findings, indispensable information on the requirements for examining the vibration response of the plate is obtained.

For this purpose, in 273 patients with middle- or late-stage primary hepatocellular carcinoma, verapamil, IL-2, and chemotherapeutic agents were infused into the target tumor vasculature through femoral artery using Seldinger technique. The medications were infused as serial dilutions, and effectiveness was evaluated after two treatment cycles. Among these 273 patients, 76 cases showed clinical cure or significant improvement, 119 cases improved, 64 cases stabilized, while 14 cases progressed or deteriorated. In 238 patients, KPS score and body weights were stabilized. Regarding side effects, 99 patients (36.3%) developed leukopenia; 160 patients had gastrointestinal reactions (58.6%); 80 patients (29.3%) presented with elevated ALT/AST profile; and 65 cases (23.8%) had pyrexia; however, these side effects abated quickly. No elevations in BUN/Cr and/or allergic reactions were observed. Pre- and post-intervention cardiac function did not change in all the patients. No significant change was observed in ECG. Liver function was also improved after two cycles of treatment. It was concluded that verapamil management via targeted arterial infusion could effectively reverse the multidrug resistance in cancer cells in primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients and therefore enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy. © 2010 The Author(s).

With known voice-coil displacement, voice-coil current, and stimulus signal as inputs, four calculation procedures for the direct problem, adjoint problem, sensitivity problem, and conjugate gradient method are involved in inversely solving the unknown electromechanical parameters. The proposed method features high efficiency in solving the direct problem through a hybrid spline difference method. It requires a small number of iterations for the computational algorithm, while offering excellent accuracy in parameter estimations. Analysis results demonstrate small differences between the estimated and measured electromechanical parameters under a variety of stimulus signals, excitation times, and initial guesses. The results are also confirmed by experimental measurements.

The as-grown (001) and (311) A Ga0.93 Mn0.07 As layers exhibit the same Curie temperature (TC) of 80 K. However, upon annealing, the TC 's of the (001) and (311) A Ga0.93 Mn0.07 As layers are enhanced by 80 and 60 K, respectively. X-ray diffraction studies reveal that the AsGa defects cannot be removed by low-temperature annealing, and a higher concentration of AsGa defects exist in the (311) A layers than in the (100) reference layers. The less enhancement in TC by annealing for the (311) A Ga0.93 Mn0.07 As layer can be ascribed to the larger amount of AsGa defects in the material. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

Methods: Representatives from 21 general hospitals and specialized hospitals from Liaoning province, Jiangsu province, Sichuan province, Guangdong province and Shanghai participated in a training course on promotion of ethical review capability; they were surveyed by anonymous questionnaire. Another 20 clinical trial agencies and ethical committees were interviewed by telephone. The questionnaires were collected and valid questionnaires were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: We found that 65.1% of the interviewees never used a central institutional review board (IRB); the main reasons included that they could not assess the quality of central IRB, they wanted to protect the subjects, they had a poor communication with the IRB, and they could not obtain a satisfactorily-localized informed consent forms. There were 34.9% of the interviewees used a central IRB, because they wanted to shorten the inspection time, avoid influence to the research progress, and to have satisfactory quality of IRB. Conclusion: Central IRB is not widely accepted. The related system needs to be further completed so as to improve the outcome of the inspection. The communication and cooperation between the central and local IRBs should be strengthened.

In addition to the transverse electric field and extensional strain, the longitudinal electric field and transverse shear strain are also taken into account in the model. As a result, the model enables both static and dynamic analysis along the in-plane as well as out-of-plane directions. Hence, the present model not only provides an approach to analyze piezoelectric transducers but also serves as a means to study piezoelectric sensors and actuators. In terms of analyzing a PZT-4 transducer, numerical results of the present model are compared with those of the equivalent circuit method by Mason that ignores the longitudinal electric potential and the transverse shear strain.

The traditional numerical root search process, which requires considerable computational effort, is no longer needed. Solutions of the modal patterns (eigenvectors) for all propagating (and nonpropagating) modes are particularly emphasized, because a complete set of properly normalized eigenvectors are crucial for solving the vibration problem of a finite shell under various admissible boundary conditions. The dispersion relations and the associated eigenvectors are also the means by which to construct transfer matrices used to analyze the vibroacoustic transmission in cylindrical shell structures or pipe-hose systems. The eigenvectors obtained from the conventional method in shell analysis are not as conveniently normalized as those commonly used in mathematical physics. The present research proposes a new alternative method to find eigenvectors that are normalized such that their norms equal unity. A parallel display of the dispersion curves and the associated modal patterns has been used in the discussion and shown to provide a more insightful understanding of the wave phenomena in a cylindrical shell. © 2009 by ASME.

78650442268	The first damped frequency with maximum sound pressure of a miniature loudspeaker for cellular phones	For improving the performance of a miniature loudspeaker, engineers have been pursuing a goal of lowering its first damped frequency to have a broad and smooth region of its sound-pressure-level response. This article applies the approach of electro-mechano-acoustical analogy to study the first damped frequency of a miniature loudspeaker used for cellular phones. Using the analogy approach, the authors derive an explicit formulation for the sound-pressure-level of a typical miniature loudspeaker of dynamic type. The veracity of the derived formulation is verified by comparing with the experimental result recorded by B and K apparatus. The derived formulation is further simplified by neglecting factors that are either irrelevant or insignificant for the first damped frequency. Through basic algebraic and calculus operations, this article also presents an explicit form of the first damped frequency. This work has laid the platform for engineers to tailor the design in pursuit of improving the performance of miniature loudspeakers.

This earphone incorporates a miniature loudspeaker commonly used in computer, communication, consumer, and car electronics. Through the laser triangulation method, electroacoustic parameters of a miniature loudspeaker are obtained. Several earphone design configurations are analyzed in accordance with the open and closed states of front leakage hole, vent, and back leakage hole. To validate the analysis, an insert earphone that is attached to IEC-60711 coupler and a specially designed fixture tube is experimentally measured for frequency response using electroacoustic equipment in the air. Simulation and experimental results show good agreement over the complete audible frequency range. Analysis indicates that states of front leakage hole, vent, and back leakage hole of an insert earphone have significant effects on frequency response. The front leakage hole affects the low frequency response, whereas the vent affects the fundamental resonance.

79955426823	Fabrication and configuration development of silicon nitride sub-wavelength structures for solar cell application	To replace the double layer antireflection coating and improve the efficiency of solar cell, a self assembled nickel nano particle mask followed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) ion etching method is proposed to form the sub-wavelength structures (SWS) on silicon nitride (Si3N4) antireflection coating layers instead of semiconductor layer. The size and density of nickel nano particles can be controlled by the initial thickness of nickel film that is annealed to form the nano-particles on the Si3N4 film deposited on the silicon substrate. ICP etching time is responsible for controlling the height of the fabricated Si3N4 SWS on silicon substrate, which is seen from our experiment. It is found that the lowest average reflectivity of 3.12% for wavelength ranging from 350 to 1000 nm is achieved when the diameter and height of the SWS are 120-180 nm and 150-160 nm, respectively. A low reflectance below 1 % is observed over the wavelength from 590 to 680 nm for the fabricated Si3N4 SWS on silicon subs. The efficiency of Si3N4 SWS could be improved by 1.31%, compared with the single layer anti-reflection (SLAR) coatings of Si3N4, using PC1D program. The results of this study may benefit the fabrication of solar cells. © 2010 American.

79956125730	Modes of wave propagation and dispersion relations in inclusion reinforced composite plates	This paper mainly analyzes the wave dispersion relations and associated modal pattens in the inclusion-reinforced composite plates including the effect of inclusion shapes, inclusion contents, inclusion elastic constants, and plate thickness. The shape of inclusion is modeled as spheroid that enables the composite reinforcement geometrical configurations ranging from sphere to short and continuous fiber. Using the Mori-Tanaka mean-field theory, the effective elastic moduli which are able to elucidate the effect of inclusion's shape, stiffness, and volume fraction on the composite's anisotropic elastic behavior can be predicted explicitly. Then, the dispersion relations and the modal patterns of Lamb waves determined from the effective elastic moduli can be obtained by using the dynamic stiffness matrix method. Numerical simulations have been given for the various inclusion types and the resulting dispersions in various wave types on the composite plate. The types (symmetric or antisymmetric) of Lamb waves in an isotropic plate can be classified according to the wave motions about the midplane of the plate. For an orthotropic composite plate, it can also be classified as either symmetric or antisymmetric waves by analyzing the dispersion curves and inspecting the calculated modal patterns. It is also found that the inclusion contents, aspect ratios and plate thickness affect propagation velocities, higher-order mode cutoff frequencies, and modal patterns. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.

0035501279	Dynamic analysis of laminated plates containing randomly oriented reinforcements	This paper presents a micromechanics approach for examining the dynamic response of a laminated composite plate composed of randomly oriented fibres in each layer. The fibre orientation is described by a three-parameter probability density function to simulate a bias distribution. By utilizing the Mori-Tanaka mean-field theory, the effective elastic moduli of each lamina are assessed explicitly as a function of phase properties, volume fraction, orientation angles and fibre shape. Three special cases for fibre orientation have been discussed and the closed-form elastic moduli have been obtained. The resulting moduli are further applied to analyze the dynamic behaviour of laminated plates. Numerical examinations for a plate made of four layers of E-glass/epoxy fibre-reinforced laminates have been given. It is showed that the natural frequency for every fibre aspect ratio continually increases with respect to the extension of the fibre volume fraction and a higher aspect ratio leads to a higher natural frequency. Analysis results also indicate that the natural frequencies of the case in which all fibres are aligned and parallel to one direction are higher than those of the cases in which fibres are uniformly lying on a plane and a space. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0035975570	Some closed-form solutions for effective moduli of composites containing randomly oriented short fibers	This investigation presents an approach to obtain the effective moduli of both two- and three-dimensional, randomly oriented composites in terms of the shape and volume fraction of fibers. The composite fiber is treated as an spheroidal inclusion that enables its geometry ranging from short fiber to continuous fiber. To simulate spatial fiber orientation, a probability density function controlled by two Euler angles is introduced. Furthermore, based upon the Mori-Tanaka mean-field theory to account for the interaction between the fibers and matrix, an analytical approach is developed to assess the effective moduli of composites containing randomly oriented short fibers. In particular, when the fibers are uniformly distributed over a given region, closed-form solutions for the effective moduli of a two-phase composite are obtained for four special distributions of fiber orientations. Both two- and three-dimensional random orientations, resulting respectively in a transversely isotropic and a fully isotropic composite, are analyzed explicitly. Numerical examples have been given for an E-Glass/Epoxy composite. Analysis results indicate that the effective moduli are strongly affected by the volume fraction, the aspect ratio, and the orientation of fibers. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

84862809495	Dispersion relations and modes of wave propagation in inclusion-reinforced composite plates	This paper is intended to examine the effect of inclusion shapes, inclusion contents, inclusion elastic constants, and plate thickness on the dispersion relations and modes of wave propagation in inclusion-reinforced composite plates. The shape of inclusion is modeled as spheroid that enables the composite reinforcement geometrical configurations ranging from sphere to short and continuous fiber. Mori-Tanaka mean-field theory is used to predict the effective elastic moduli of the composite plate explicitly. The effective elastic moduli are able to elucidate the effect of inclusion's shape, stiffness, and volume fraction on the composite's anisotropic elastic behavior. The resulting moduli are then used to determine the dispersion relations and the modal patterns of Lamb waves using the dynamic stiffness matrix method. The types (symmetric or antisymmetric) of Lamb waves in an isotropic plate can be classified according to the wave motions are symmetrical or antisymmetric about the midplane of the plate. Classifying the wave type in an anisotropic plate is not as simple as that in an isotropic plate, and has not received proper attention in the literature. The wave types and orders are identified by analyzing the dispersion curves and inspecting the calculated modal patterns, and the results indicate that the Lamb waves in an orthotropic composite plate can also be classified as either symmetric or antisymmetric waves. It is also found that the inclusion contents, aspect ratios and plate thickness affect propagation velocities, higher-order mode cutoff frequencies, and modal patterns. Propagation speed is generally increased with the aspect ratio, e.g., using longer fibers generally results in a higher propagation speed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84863736138	Total harmonic distortion improvement for elliptical miniature loudspeaker based on suspension stiffness nonlinearity	This article reports the effect of geometric modification of diaphragm on the total harmonic distortion (THD) for an elliptical miniature loudspeaker by systematically investigating and modifying suspension stiffness. Three diaphragms, typified by different track patterns on the concave ring are simulated and experimented. Initially, the prototype specimens were tested for stiffness curves and electroacoustic parameters by laser vibrometry. Further, the stiffness curves for three sample designs were numerically modeled using finite element analysis (FEA). The loudspeaker is also modeled using equivalent circuit method (ECM) for simulating THD. As a result of employing Runge- Kutta method for the solution of a coupled system of ordinary differential equations, THD was calculated and subsequently presented as a function of frequency. In addition, their THD was measured in a standard anechoic chamber and compared with simulations. It is found that the effect of track patterns on the sound pressure level is absolutely insignificant. On contrary, effect on THD is observable and leads to the conclusion that the diaphragm with curved tracks outperforms other diaphragms (partial straight and straight tracks). The reliability of simulation and its confirmation with the measurement has assured the possibility of simulating THD by FEA and analytical method for design optimization of track patterns. © 2012 IEEE.

Additionally, the stiffness curves were also obtained using finite element analysis (FEA). For calculating total harmonic distortion (THD), the electroacoustic system is modeled using the equivalentcircuit analogy. As a result of solving the coupled system of ordinary differential equations by the Runge-Kutta method, THD of three sample designs, characterized by different track patterns, were calculated and plotted as a function of frequency. The specimens were tested in a standard anechoic chamber for recording THD. Additionally, the sound pressure level (SPL) curves of these specimens were also recorded for comparison. It turns out that, despite no significant SPL difference, diaphragms with different track patterns shall, as a result, lead to substantial variations of THD. The consistence of our simulations with the measured THD has promised the feasibility of simulating THD by FEA for optimizing the design of track patterns for diaphragm. © 2012 IEEE.

0036890474	Fracture analysis of piezoelectric materials with flat ellipsoidal cracks	The objective of this study is to investigate a three-dimensional, infinitely extended, anisotropic piezoelectric solid containing a flat ellipsoidal crack with emphasis laced on when one of the principal axes of the crack becomes zero. Utilizing the equivalent inclusion method, the electroelastic fields around the crack are obtained explicitly by treating the elastic moduli and piezoelectric coefficients of the flat ellipsoidal inclusion as zero, and neglecting the permittivity. With resulting strain, stress, electric field, and electric displacement, the interaction energy between the crack and electromechanical loads is calculated. Based on the Griffith fracture criterion, the fracture stresses and critical electric displacement of the crack respectively subjected to a simple tension, an in-plane shear, an out-of-plane shear, and an electric displacement are obtained in closed forms by utilizing the obtained interaction energy. It is shown that the resulting fracture stresses can be reduced to those for uncoupled linear elastic fracture mechanics when piezoelectric coupling is absent and the material is isotropic. Numerical results for a three-dimensional PIC-151 piezoelectric solid with a flat ellipsoidal crack are given to demonstrate the application of the proposed formulation. Analysis results also indicate that the electroelastic coupling nature reduces the fracture loads and consequently impedes crack growth. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

84885603081	A study of nonlinear harmonic distortion in a balanced armature actuator with asymmetrical magnetic flux	Abstract This study investigates the nonlinear harmonic distortion caused by the asymmetrical magnetic flux in a balanced armature actuator (BAA). To account for asymmetrical magnetic flux, a set of transduction equations with nonlinear parameters for a BAA is first established. Next, the nonlinear transduction equations are solved correctly and with great efficiency by utilizing the hybrid spline difference method. Unlike symmetrical magnetic flux that leads to odd-order harmonic distortion only, analysis results demonstrate that asymmetrical magnetic flux in the electromagnetic field leads to the simultaneous appearance of even- and odd-order harmonic distortions. Meanwhile, the present study also indicates that the nonlinear harmonic distortion of the BAA can be reduced by adjusting the eccentric position of the armature and the cross-sectional area of the air gap between the permanent magnets and armature. Results presented herein provide valuable information not only on the desired design of a BAA but also on the diagnosis and improvement of its performance. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Three special cases for fiber orientation have been discussed and the closed-form stiffnesses have bene obtained. Equations of motion for a composite plate in a general state of non-uniform initial stresses, where the effects of transverse shear and rotatory inertia are included, are derived by using Trefftz equations and the variational principle.

0041352017	Micromechanics determinations of thermoelectroelastic fields and effective thermoelectroelastic moduli of piezoelectric composites	By modelling thermal expansion strain and electric field induced by a uniform temperature change as eigenfields, the eigenstrain formulation (T. Mura, Micromechanics of Defects in Solids, 2nd revised edn., Martinus Nijhoff, 1987) for anisotropic inclusion problems is extended to consider the inherently anisotropic coupled behaviour of a piezoelectric composite. Utilizing the extended eigenstrain formulation, a unified explicit expression for the electroelastic tensors analogous to Eshelby tensors for elastic ellipsoidal inclusions is obtained. Particularly, closed forms for the electroelastic Eshelby tensors are presented when both the piezoelectric matrix and piezoelectric inclusions are transversely isotropic, and the shapes of the inclusions are spheroidal, elliptic cylindrical, circular cylindrical, penny-shaped, and ribbon-like. With the resulting tensors, analytical expressions for the thermoelectroelastic fields of the piezoelectric composite can then be obtained. Moreover, based on the Mori-Tanaka theory and the equivalent inclusion method to account for interaction at finite concentrations of inhomogeneities, the effective thermal expansion coefficients, pyroelectric coefficients, elastic moduli, piezoelectric coefficients, and dielectric constants of the piezoelectric composite material in terms of phase properties, volume fraction, and the shape of the inhomogeneities are presented in closed forms.

The Mori-Tanaka mean-field theory is adopted here to account for the interaction at the finite concentrations of reinforcements in the composite material. The effective elastic moduli of the composite material are expressed as a function of the phase properties, volume fraction, orientation angles of its constituents. The finite element model of the rotating continuous fiber-reinforced composite shafts derived previously by authors is extended here to the case that contains the fiber inclusions by taking these effective elastic moduli into account. Based on this model, the natural frequencies of the stationary shafts, and the whirling speeds as well as the critical speeds of the rotating shafts are investigated.

Based on the eigenstrain formulation and the Mori-Tanaka theory, the magneto-electro-elastic Eshelby tensors and the effective material properties of the composite are obtained explicitly. Particularly when both the matrix and the inclusions of the composite are transversely isotropic with different magneto-electro-elastic moduli, and shapes of inclusions are of elliptical cylinder, circular cylinder, disk, and ribbon, simple and closed-form solutions for the magnetoelectric coupling coefficients are acquired. The solutions are a function of the shape of inclusion, phase properties, and volume fraction of inclusions. Moreover, the derived simple expressions also show that the magnetoelectric coupling coefficients vanish as the volume fraction of inclusions tends to zero or one. This verifies that the magnetoelectric coupling coefficients are absent in each phase of the composite.

Recently, PET/PU composite board is becoming one popular and functional material because of the high flexibility in the abilities, such as thermal-protection, chemical-proof, acoustic-resistance and etc. Thus, it is important to realize the variations of absorption capability from single material to complete composite material, and feedback some suggestions to the designer. Results shows that nonwoven only has a stable increase in absorption coefficient with the frequencies because of the inherent porous characteristics. With the substantial properties, foam has lower absorption coefficient and two peaks occurring in the higher frequencies. Both two peaks are caused by the resonance between wave and foam at specified frequency. With an additional nonwoven in the rear side of composite foam, absorption coefficient of PET/PU composite board will effectively increase.

Houbolt time marching scheme and quadratic extrapolation technique are used for the temporal discretization and linearization, respectively. Numerical results are presented for laminated plates made of E-glass/Epoxy fiber reinforced composites. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

11044220602	Post-buckling of cross-ply laminated rectangular plates containing short random fibers	Post-buckling of cross-ply laminated composite plate containing randomly oriented short spatial fibers in each layer is obtained analytically, using fast converging double Chebyshev series. The mathematical formulation is based on first-order shear deformation theory and von-Karman non-linearity. The effective elastic properties of the composites are expressed analytically in terms of phase properties, orientation angles, volume fraction, and fiber shape. The effects of fiber orientation in the composites, fiber volume fraction, fiber aspect ratio, and plate span to thickness ratio on the buckling and post-buckling strength are studied. Numerical results for E-glass/Epoxy fiber reinforced laminates are presented for the different boundary conditions and the number of layers of the composite. The results indicate that complete random distribution of the fibers in the composites gives higher buckling and post-buckling strength. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
