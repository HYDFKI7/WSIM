1442283408	A Simple and Effective Route for the Synthesis of Crystalline Silver Nanorods and Nanowires	A simple and effective approach to the aqueous-phase synthesis of crystalline silver nanorods and nanowires is demonstrated, using which their diameters and aspect ratios can be effectively controlled. The synthesis involves a template-less and non-seed process to high-quality nanoparticles, which is low-cost and proceeds at moderate temperatures. The nanorods and nanowires were synthesized by the reduction of silver nitrate with tri-sodium citrate in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfonate. The concentration of tri-sodium citrate plays a critical role while sodium dodecylsulfonate, as a capping agent, only plays an assistant role in controlling the diameters and aspect ratios of the products. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) investigations show that the silver nanocrystals are generated with a twinned crystalline structure. We also put forward a primary experimental model to shed light on their growth mechanisms.

19944398166	Growth of silver nanowires from solutions: A cyclic penta-twinned-crystal growth mechanism	Silver nanowires are synthesized by simple reduction of the silver ions with reductants such as glucose, sodium citrate, and sodium hypophosphite, etc., in the absence of the so-called surfactants or capping reagents at the temperature from 80 to 200 °C. Regardless of the reductants, the nanowires prepared at a given temperature are uniform in diameters, ranging from 30 to 50 nm at 100 °C. Nanoparticles coexist with nanowires in the products with larger diameters (usually larger than 50 nm). We find that all the silver nanowires in the as-prepared products are of cyclic penta-twinned structure, where five crystallites bond by the {111} facets. We propose that the intrinsic factor of the cyclic penta-twinned structure, i.e., the angular mismatch of the five crystallites in forming a gapless rod, controls the size of the nanowires and guides the directional growth of the nanowires with {110} as the active facets. The nanoparticles in the products are aggregates of imperfect penta-twinned crystals, which inhibits them from growing into nanowires and results in larger size. From the structural information of the nanoparticles synthesized at room temperature, we propose that the formation of the cyclic penta-twinned structure is due to the stacking fault and the intrinsic equilibrium structures of the lower energy. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

0012863492	Kinetics of thermal inactivation of Penaeus penicillatus acid phosphatase	The kinetics of thermal inactivation of Penaeus penicillatus acid phosphatase have been studied using a kinetic method related to the substrate reaction during irreversible inhibition of the enzyme activity as previously described by Tsou (Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. (1988) 61, 381-436). The kinetics of thermal inactivation of the enzyme show that the reaction is irreversible. The microscopic rate constants were determined for thermal inactivation of free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex. The results show that the presence of substrate has a significant protective effect against thermal inactivation of the enzyme.

0032045428	Nanomodification of polypyrrole and polyaniline on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite electrodes by atomic force microscopy	This paper describes the first observation of localized electropolymerization of pyrrole and aniline on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrates under atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip-sample interactions. A scanning or oscillating AFM tip, providing the horizontal scratching force and the vertical tapping force, is essential as the driving force for the surface modification with the conducting polymer. The significant tip effect on the electropolymerization has been discussed on the basis of the electropolymerization mechanism. It has been shown that under the AFM tip interaction, the electropolymerization can be blocked on the bare HOPG substrate or enhanced on the as-polymerized film. The localized electropolymerization in selected surface areas enables the nanomodification of lines, square platforms, or hollows of polypyrrole (PPY) and polyaniline (PAN) on the substrates. The result indicates that AFM can be used as a unique tool for nanofabrication of conducting polymers.

The X-ray powder diffraction pattern indicates that the products are hexagonal graphite. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy show that the thickness of crumpled carbon nanosheets ranges from 3 to 8 nm. Raman spectroscopy supports the existence of graphitized carbon at the nanoscale. BET experiments show that carbon nanosheets have a large surface area. Compared with previous methods to prepare graphite nanosheets, such a low reaction temperature has attractive advantages. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

2842522722	In-situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy studies of nucleation of single nucleus on microelectrodes	The electrochemical nucleation and growth of silver single nucleus on glassy carbon microelectrode have been monitored in-situ with electrochemical atomic force microscopy (ECAFM) at different stages. The AFM results show that the silver single nucleus forms at the edge of the glassy carbon and grows to form a crystallite with (100) facet preferentially dominated. It is confirmed that the nucleation process strongly relies on the condition of glassy carbon substrate. Multiple nuclei are formed on the substrate with nucleation history but single nucleus can be achieved on the same substrate after the application of a special "purging" method. The work is the first example for the real time observation of nucleation and growth of a single nucleus on a microelectrode and for the application of ECAFM to the studies of microelectrode systems. Comparison of the work with previous ex-situ measurements are given. The work also demonstrates a possible way to obtain a single crystal microelectrode which could be valuable for various purposes.

2842612745	In situ studies of highly oriented Zn-Ni alloy electroplating by using ECSTM	Based on a very effective "two-step-coating" method developed for ECSTM tip preparation, highly oriented Zn-Ni alloy electroplating was studied by in situ ECSTM. The in situ ECSTM observation showed a 3-D growth of the Zn-Ni alloy crystal in the absence of the additives. However, when additive AA-1/DIE was introduced to the plating solution, the Zn-Ni alloy crystal grew along the step and layer by layer. This result indicated that the crystal plane of lower electrochemical activity may be reserved to form the highly, oriented layer along the surface of the electrode. The X-ray diffraction patterns showed a highly oriented (100) crystal plane of the deposition along the electrode surface in the presence of AA-1/DIE additive.

Fabrication of hollow structures was predicted to open up possibilities for various new application fields such as light weight material.

Their interconnect was dominated by EOF making them applicable for injection of small amounts of analyte solutions from one microchannel into another.

33646236352	Site-selective adsorption of C2 H5 OH and NO depending on the local structure or local electron density on the Si (111) -7x7 surface	The sticking probability of ethanol (C2 H5 OH) on a Si (111) -7×7 surface is entirely coverage independent, and the adsorption is suddenly stopped when three adatoms (half of the adatoms) are changed to Si-O C2 H5 in every half unit cell. This Si (111) -7×7 surface saturated with C2 H5 OH, however, is active for the adsorption of NO. A more surprising fact is that the sticking probability of NO on this surface is equal to that on the virgin Si (111) -7×7 surface. That is, the sticking probability of C2 H5 OH and NO on a Si (111) -7×7 surface has no influence of the coverage of Si-adatoms with Si-O C2 H5. From these results, we deduced that the dissociation of NO and C2 H5 OH takes place via the precursor state adsorption. The coverage of adatoms gives no effect on the sticking probability of NO and C2 H5 OH, the adsorption of NO on the faulted halves prefers that on unfaulted halves (F U=2.2∼2.4), although no such preference was observed in the adsorption of C2 H5 OH (F U=1). N and O atoms formed by the dissociation of NO migrate over the surface and are finally trapped by Si-adatoms. On the other hand, adsorption of C2 H5 OH occurs by dissociating the precursor state molecule on an adatom-rest atom site, which is the final step of the adsorption. Therefore, the scanning tunneling microscopy image of C2 H5 OH reflects the structure of the sites, while that of NO reflects the electron density of sites. The physical meaning of the sticking probability, preferential adsorption on the faulted or unfaulted halves, and site selectivity of the center to corner adatoms in a half unit cell are discussed. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33947403040	One-step construction of ZnS/C and CdS/C one-dimensional core-shell nanostructures	ZnS/C and CdS/C coaxial core-shell nanowires, which consist of single-crystal semiconductor nanowires encapsulated by carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have been synthesized by simple one-step thermal processes. These coaxial core-shell nanowires have uniform outer diameters (80-180 nm for ZnS/C, 60-130 nm for CdS/C), and uniform shell thicknesses (ca. tens of nanometers) along their entire lengths up to tens of microns. The growth of the core-shell nanowires follows a novel metal reaction and self-catalysis vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. The simple method could, in principle, be extended to synthesize other metal sulfide single-crystal nanowire-filled carbon nanotubes, which can find potential applications in various fields of nanotechnology. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2007.

34147112264	Growth of prussian blue microcubes under a hydrothermal condition: Possible nonclassical crystallization by a mesoscale self-assembly	A classical crystallization process starts from stable nuclei followed by a simple enlargement of the nuclei by unit-cell replication, In recent years, the universality of such classical crystallization has been questioned upon investigations of biomineralization processes, and there are few examples showing that crystal growth may not follow such a classical crystallization process. In this paper, a typical coordination polymer, Prussian blue microcrystals, has been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. By carefully analyzing the intermediates during the crystal growth process, we found that the growth of Prussian blue under the given growth conditions may follow a nonclassical crystal growth process in which a mesoscale self-assembly of nanocrystallites is included during crystal growth. Such a mesoscale self-assembly process could be a common phenomenon for growth of some crystals with extremely low solubility. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

It was found that the absence of the supporting electrolyte played a key role in the formation of silver nanowires, and the products from the solution without supporting electrolytes were very different from those with supporting electrolytes. A possible mechanism concerning the transportation of silver ions by electro-migration and the diffusion was proposed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

35248879340	Controlled growth of Zn nano-dots on a Si (111) -7×7 surface saturated with C2H5OH	Metal atoms bonded with Si adatoms on the Si (111) - (7×7) surface undergo migration by hopping adjacent Si-rest atoms with dangling bond. By saturated adsorption of Si (111) - (7×7) surface with C2 H5 OH, the whole Si-rest atoms and a half of Si adatoms are occupied with Si-H and Si-O C2 H5, so that the Zn atoms adsorbed on this surface cannot migrate by hopping. When Zn atoms were deposited on this surface, ca. 5 nm Zn dots were grown in the hexagonal spacing of ca. 5.4 nm width around the corner holes, which work as a mold. This is quite different from the growth of honeycomb layers composed of Zn3 clusters on the clean Si (111) - (7×7) surface. The dots grow up to nine (1.97 nm) to 13 layers (2.64 nm) by keeping their size, which implies a layer-by-layer growth of dots in the mold, where the growth is controlled by the kinetics instead of energetic feasibility. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

0033872109	Self-organization of physisorbed secondary alcohol molecules on a graphite surface	The monolayer of a secondary alcohol (nonacosan-10-ol) formed at the interface between a solution of this alcohol in tetradecane and the basal plane of graphite is studied by in-situ scanning tunneling microscopy. The interface layer consists of a juxtaposition of lamellae, which are formed by a close packing arrangement of molecules parallel to the graphite surface. In fact, the molecules are coupled through their OH groups, which form hydrogen bonding, as clearly shown in images obtained for a particular range of bias. However, Van der Waals interactions determine the packing of couples to form lamellae. As STM images of a monolayer from a racemic mixture of R and S nonacosanol molecules show no difference from the ones originating from pure S or R enantiomer of nonacosanol, no chirality influence is observed in the layer structure. A packing model based on an unsupported couple of nonacosane 10-ol, the energy of which is minimized by using a semi-empiric method, yields a structure in good agreement with STM data. Comparison with results obtained on primary alcohol monolayer provides insights on the different parameters, which influence the signature of OH group in STM images.

0033875610	Molecular structure of self-assembled pyrrolidone monolayers on the Au (111) surface: formation of hydrogen bond-stabilized hexamers	Adsorption of 2-pyrrolidone and 3-methyl 2-pyrrolidone molecules onto Au (111) surfaces has been studied by using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In photoemission spectra, 1s N peak shows two components at 398.1 and 399.8 eV for the pyrrolidone overlayer while one peak grows up at 398.3 eV for the methyl pyrrolidone layer. STM images show a disordered methyl pyrrolidone overlayer, while the pyrrolidone layer exhibits area with a periodic arrangement, which can be described either as a √21 × √21 R ± 11° structure with respect to Au (111) lattice or as a two-dimensional close packing of hexamers. We propose a model based on semi-empirical calculations for optimization of the geometry of an unsupported hexamer formed by six pyrrolidone molecules interacting with their two nearest neighbors through hydrogen bonds. In this model, the plane of each molecule is tilted with respect to the substrate, which yields a molecule-molecule distance equal to 0.5 nm in good agreement with STM measurements. Finally, the nature of the bonding between pyrrolidone and methyl pyrrolidone molecules and gold atoms is discussed from STM data and XPS spectra.

Self-assembled monolayers have been observed only for NTP and Py molecules, whereas STM images show a disordered Mpy overlayer. The XPS measurements on Py and Mpy monolayers reveal that the nitrogen atom of the pyrrolidone group is involved in different chemical bonds, depending on the molecule. Considering both STM and XPS data, models of molecule packing are proposed. Finally, tacking advantage of the different locations of the pyrrolidone function in these monolayers, we discuss the parameters that govern the presence of the pyrrolidone group in STM images.

84861531183	Structural investigations and growth mechanism of well-defined Ag dendrites prepared by conventional redox displacement	Ag dendrites have inspired considerable research because of their fascinating hierarchical structures, unique optical properties, and widespread applications. However, the intrinsic structures and exact growth process of the Ag dendrites are still far from being completely understood and need to be investigated further. In this paper, well-defined silver dendrites with primary-, secondary-, and higher-order branches have been prepared by conventional redox displacement. The structures of as-prepared Ag dendrites have been systematically investigated by SEM, SAED and HRTEM. The results of SAED and HRTEM reveal that the well-defined silver dendrites have single crystal nature with many defects existed in every level structure. A mechanism based on site-specific sequential nucleation and the subsequently preferential growth along principal crystallographic axes under a non-equilibrium condition was proposed to explain the formation of Ag dendrites in the present case. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Especially, spatially uniform alloy NCs are very difficult to achieve because of the different reduction rates of the individual alloy components. Herein we propose a facile wet chemical synthetic strategy to prepare uniform bimetallic alloy NCs with tunable composition by controlling the growth of alloy NCs under diffusion controlled conditions. Using this strategy, we successfully synthesized trisoctahedral (TOH) Au-Pd alloy NCs enclosed by {hhl} high-index facets with uniform spatial distributions and different compositions. Significantly, using our strategy, the composition of the as-prepared Au-Pd alloy NCs is identical to the ratio of the two metal precursors in the reaction solution over a wide range. Investigation of the composition-dependent electrochemical behavior of the as-prepared TOH Au-Pd alloy NCs showed that the TOH Au-Pd alloy NCs containing 14.1 atom% Pd exhibited the best activity. © 2012 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the roles of the adsorbate-adsorbate and the adsorbate - substrate interactions, as well as the origin of the high stability of the CA·M SAMs, were discussed. In addition to the preparation of the CA·M SAMs, SAMs of melamine and cyanuric acid molecules alone were also studied on the Au(111) surfaces.

The as-prepared hematite CNCs are composed of numerous nanocrystals of approximately 20 nm in size, and present a single-crystal-like characteristic. A possible formation process based on the nucleation-oriented aggregation-recrystallization mechanism is proposed. Our experiments demonstrated that both the surfactant and the mixed solvent play very critical roles in controlling the size of primary nanocrystals and the final morphology of single-crystal-like spherical CNCs. Compared with other hematite nanostructures, the spherical hematite CNCs show outstanding performance in gas sensing, photocatalysis and water treatment due to their large surface area and porous structure.

70350616213	Fabrication of large-scale one-dimensional Au nanochain and nanowire networks by interfacial self-assembly	By utilizing the strong capillary attraction between interfacial nanoparticles, large-scale one-dimensional Au nanochain networks were fabricated at the n-butanol/water interface, and could be conveniently transferred onto hydrophilic substrates. Furthermore, the length of the nanochains could be adjusted simply by controlling the density of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) at the n-butanol/water interface. Surprisingly, the resultant Au nanochains could further transform into smooth nanowires by increasing the aging time, forming a nanowire network. Combined characterization by HRTEM and UV-vis spectroscopy indicates that the formation of Au nanochains stemmed from a stochastic assembly of interfacial AuNPs due to strong capillary attraction, and the evolution of nanochains to nanowires follows an Ostwald ripening mechanism rather than an oriented attachment. This method could be utilized to fabricate large-area nanochain or nanowire networks more uniformly on solid substrates than that of evaporating a solution of nanochain colloid, since it eliminates the three-dimensional aggregation behavior. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

77953228397	Control of the surface of ZnO nanostructures by selective wet-chemical etching	In this article, we demonstrate successful application of a top-down strategy based on a selective wet-chemical etching technique in fabrication of nanostructures with a special morphology. Pagoda-like and hexagonal pyramidal ZnO nanostructures with the polar (0001) and {1011} planes as exposed surfaces have been synthesized by refluxing ZnO columns mainly bounded with {1010} nonpolar faces in the mixed solvent of oleic acid (OA) and 1-octylamine. Adequate evidence demonstrates that OA in the mixed solvent acts as the etchant in the process of morphology evolution, and the appropriate proportion of OA, reaction time, and reaction temperature are crucial for controlling the etching degree of ZnO. Through the selective wet-chemical etching, it has been confirmed that the dumbbell-like ZnO is of twinning morphologies growing along contrary direction on both sides of the (0001) twinning plane. Therefore, our present work provides a simple way to estimate the complicated twinning phenomena. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77958006561	A simple solvothermal route towards the morphological control of ZnO and tuning of its optical and photocatalytic properties	ZnO nanoparticles with different morphologies were solvothermally synthesized by controlling the alkali (sodium hydroxide) concentration in an isopropanol solution. The products were characterized by means of powder X-ray diffraction, UV-visible absorption spectra, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and selected area electron diffraction. The morphologies of the formed ZnO nanocrystals were dependent on the concentration of the alkali, and with increases of sodium hydroxide concentration, the ZnO nanocrystals evolved from rod to hexagonal bipyramid, and then to a flower-like nanostructure. The flower-like nanostructure resulted from the etching of the hexagonal bipyramid by the excess alkali. The photoluminescence and photocatalytic properties of the prepared ZnO were investigated. The difference of green emission among the ZnO nanocrystals indicated that a higher sodium hydroxide concentration led to a higher level of defects. The size, the surface structure and defects in the ZnO nanocrystals affected its photo-degradation characteristics. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

The NDC molecules form an incommensurate structure, while BDC molecules form a commensurate structure on the HOPG surface. The aromatic rings take the same orientation with that of the underlying HOPG substrate to gain optimum adsorbate-substrate interactions. On the Au(1 1 1) surface, both molecules form incommensurate structures. The orientations of aromatic ring locate about 20° with respect to the gold rows, the 〈1 1 0〉 direction. On the HOPG surface, the whole carboxyl groups are invisible, while the carbon atoms of the carboxyl groups may appear bright on the gold surface. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The XRD pattern indicates that the crystal structure of the nanorods is face-centre-cubic rocksalt. A SEM image shows that the nanorods have a diameter of 40-70 nm and a length of 200-600 nm, and both tips exhibit taper-like structures. HRTEM and SAED images reveal the single-crystalline nature of the nanorods with the growth along the (111) direction. The experimental results indicated that the P123 concentration and reaction temperature played important roles in controlling the morphology of the PbS nanostructures.

Single-crystal-like MgO NCs were prepared by a simple one-pot pyrolysis method in the mixed organic solvent of octylamine (OTA) and oleic acid (OA) using magnesium acetate as a precursor. Under the chemical equilibrium of etching and re-growth with the assistance of OA, the MgO products were surface functionalized. It was found that such surface functionalized MgO NCs exhibited intense visible light PL with high PL thermal-stability, and the apparent quantum yield was as high as 19 ± 1%. In addition, through controlling the synthetic temperature and the reaction time, the functionalized surfaces of MgO NCs were facilely tuned, resulting in the tuneable wavelength of the PL from blue-violet to yellow. Different low-coordinated oxygen sites, capping OA and carbonate species on the surface of the MgO nanocrystals were thought to be the origin of PL at different wavelengths. Considering the intense PL, high PL stability at ambient conditions, low cost and low toxicity, such MgO NCs might have potential applications in medicine and biology as a new kind of fluorescent label. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

0036215095	Influence of reconstruction on the structure of self-assembled normal-alkane monolayers on Au(111) surfaces	Ordered normal-alkane monolayers of lamellar structures are found to form in the interface between alkane solutions and the reconstructed Au (111) surfaces. The boundaries of the lamellae may exhibit a zigzag shape. In the alkane monolayers, two kinds of packing of the alkane molecules are observed. The packing patterns are correlated to the structure of the gold surface and the molecular lengths of the alkanes. The orientation of alkane molecules is gently disturbed by the reconstructed gold ridges. Furthermore, the lamellar boundaries are located on the elbow positions of the reconstructed gold surfaces for long-chain alkanes. These results demonstrate that the structures of self-assembled monolayers of normal alkanes are sensitive to the structures of the Au (111) surfaces.

It still remains a challenge to develop reliable and versatile approaches to prepare Pd-based nanostructures with higher performance and better stability. In this article, a facile solution route has been developed to prepare Pd nanospheres, as well as Pd-Pt, Pd-Ag and Pd-Pt-Ag alloy nanospheres. SEM and TEM investigations revealed that the as-prepared nanospheres were three-dimensionally interconnected porous networks with primary nanoparticles as building blocks. The chemical composition of these nanospheres can be easily adjusted by controlling the molar ratio of precursors. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the electrocatalytic activity of these nanospheres towards formic acid oxidation depended on the composition of the nanospheres. By judiciously adjusting the composition of the Pd based alloy nanospheres, the performance of the Pd based catalysts, i.e., the onset potential of the formic acid oxidation, the corresponding peak current density and the ability to tolerate CO, can be optimized. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Compared with the pure ZnO NCs, photoluminescence (PL) of the Er-doped ZnO NCs made an improvement in the visible emissions, which was attributed to the defects or vacancies resulted from Er-dopants. The enhanced defects or vacancies resulted in high activity surfaces, which benefit sensing properties. Furthermore, sensing experiments confirmed that the sensing performance of Er-doped ZnO NCs was improved almost doubled than the pure ZnO NCs. Therefore, the high sensibility gas sensors based on Er-doped ZnO NCs were successfully fabricated. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this way, we successfully achieve orientation-controllable assemblies of AuNRs into side-by-side (SS), end-to-end (EE) and end-to-side (ES) orientations based on the electrostatic interaction between carboxylic PEG and CTAB capping on AuNRs. Furthermore, we find that the different orientations of assembled motifs in these three types of AuNRs assemblies exhibited different near field coupling between the surface plasma of the neighboring AuNRs, leading to different surface-enhanced Raman signals. Undoubtedly, the current rational design of oriented assembly can be potentially useful for directing anisotropic nanoparticles into well-defined orientations, which provides a powerful route in designing families of novel nanodevices and nanomaterials with programmable electrical and optical properties. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The success of this synthesis relies on the use of Pd nanocubes with different sizes as the seeds and the use of formaldehyde as a relatively mild reducing agent. By controlling the ratio of Pd precursor to the seed, we obtained uniform polyhedrons such as truncated cubes, cuboctahedrons, truncated octahedrons, and octahedrons in a purity approaching 100%. The sizes of these polyhedrons were determined by the edge length of the cubic seeds. Since these Pd polyhedrons were characterized by different proportions of {111} to {100} facets, they could serve as model catalysts to uncover the correlation between the surface structure and the catalytic performance for formic acid oxidation. Our measurements indicate that Pd nanocubes exhibited the highest maximum current density in the forward anodic scan, but the peak position was also located at a potential higher than those of the other polyhedrons. When both the current density and the operation potential are taken into consideration, Pd nanocubes with slight truncation at the corners become the best choice of catalyst for formic acid oxidation. Our study also revealed that the size of Pd polyhedrons had essentially no effect on the activity for formic acid oxidation. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The synthesis involved the use of Pd seeds with different shapes (including cubes, cuboctahedra, and octahedra) for the epitaxial growth of Cu shells. Different from the conventional growth mode, Cu atoms initially nucleated only on a few of the many faces of a Pd seed, onto which more Cu atoms were continuously added to generate Cu blocks. Later, the Cu atoms also started to nucleate and grow on other faces of the Pd seed until the entire surface of the seed was covered by a Cu shell. As a result, the Pd seed was rarely located in the center of each core-shell structure. The final product took a cubic shape enclosed by {100} facets regardless of the type of Pd seeds used because of the selective capping of Cu(100) surface by hexadecylamine. The edge lengths of the Pd@Cu nanocubes could be tuned from 50 to 100 nm by varying the amount of Pd seeds while keeping the amount of CuCl

84862822143	Facile syntheses and enhanced electrocatalytic activities of Pt nanocrystals with {hkk} high-index surfaces	Platinum (Pt) is an outstanding catalyst for many important industrial products. Because of its high cost and scarce reserves, it is very important to improve the performance of Pt catalysts. As the metal nanocrystals (NCs) with high-index surfaces usually show very good catalytic activity because of their high density of atomic steps and kinks, the preparation of Pt NCs with high-index facets has become a very important and hot research topic recently. In this article, we report a facile synthesis of high-yield Pt NCs with a series of {hkk} high-index facets including {211} and {411} via a solvothermal method using Pt(II) acetylacetonate as the Pt source, 1-octylamine as the solvent and capping agent, and formaldehyde as an additional surface structure regulator. Multipod Pt NCs with dominant {211} side surfaces were produced without formaldehyde, while concave Pt NCs with dominant {411} surfaces formed under the influence of formaldehyde. By analyzing the products by IR spectroscopy, we found the presence of CO on the surface of concave Pt NCs with {411} surfaces prepared from the solution containing formaldehyde. It was concluded that amine mainly stabilized the monoatomic step edges, resulting in the {211} exposed surface; with addition of formaldehyde, it decomposed into CO, leading to the formation of {411} surfaces by the additional adsorption of the CO on the {100} terraces. In addition, it was found that the as-prepared Pt NCs with high-index {211} and {411} surfaces exhibited much better catalytic activity in the electro-oxidation of ethanol than a commercial Pt/C catalyst or Pt nanocubes with low-index {100} surfaces, and the catalytic activities of Pt crystal facets decreased in the sequence {411}>{211}>{100}. © 2012 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Adequate evidence demonstrates that the OA in the mixed solvent acts as the etching agent.

A threshold bias of 0.6 V (tip negative) at a low tunneling current of ∼50 pA is required to image the as-formed SnO thin film by STM, typical of a semiconductor characteristic. Increasing the tunneling current to ∼2 nA leads to the reduction of the SnO back to Sn. Based on the energy level calculation for the SnO, a mechanism involving direct electron tunneling is proposed to account for the tip-induced reduction. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The induced etching rate is shown to depend on the tunneling current. The mechanism of the etching process is proposed on the basis that the tunneling of electrons occurs directly from the valence band of the silicon electrode into the empty states at the tip, leading to a hole injection in the silicon surface, followed by an electrochemical oxidation on the local surface underneath the tip.

The triangles typically appear pairwise with an average length of the baselines of ∼20.2 ±1.0 nm and a height of the triangles of ∼10.6 ± 1.4 nm at a corrugation height of ∼0.05 nm. The baselines of the trigonal network rotate by 30° with respect to the corresponding double rows of the (√3 × 22) reconstruction and align along one of the three {110} directions. An atomic resolution image reveals an apparent (√3 × √3) structure in the regions with hcp stacking sites enclosed by the triangles, which is attributed to the atomically dispersed surface alloy structure of Sb with the topmost Au atoms. Similar relaxation structures are observed with decreasing coverage via irreversible adsorption, although the size of the relaxation is alleviated. The surface alloying is confirmed by the creation of holes upon anodic stripping, the holes being confined at the connections between the two triangles. The results are rationalized as a consequence of compromise between two opposing effects: directional bonding via electron back donation, which tends to lift the reconstruction, and dislocation-mediated alloying, which favors the formation of relaxed reconstruction. The present study provides a good link with the studies in UHV as well as further knowledge for a thorough understanding of (sub)monolayer deposition in electrochemical environments.

The structure of the catalysts was characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Among these catalysts, the carbon nanotube-supported bimetallic Pt-Sn catalyst (Pt-Sn/CNT) showed the best performance, exhibiting over 97% conversion and 92% selectivity to ethanol under relatively mild conditions. The addition of Sn to Pt catalyst inhibited the CC bond cleavage activity and enhanced the selectivity of the catalyst to ethanol, due to the formation and well-dispersion of PtSn alloy on the CNT surfaces. The catalytic performance depended on the ratio of Sn and Pt and the particle size of PtSn alloy. The one-step reduction method was conductive to preparing catalyst with smaller PtSn alloy particles and higher performance, which was shown that the optimized Pt-Sn/CNT with average PtSn alloy particle size at 3.0 nm can retain its high catalytic performance for over 300 h on stream. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84881097669	Stabilization of anti-aromatic and strained five-membered rings with a transition metal	Anti-aromatic compounds, as well as small cyclic alkynes or carbynes, are particularly challenging synthetic goals. The combination of their destabilizing features hinders attempts to prepare molecules such as pentalyne, an 8π-electron anti-aromatic bicycle with extremely high ring strain. Here we describe the facile synthesis of osmapentalyne derivatives that are thermally viable, despite containing the smallest angles observed so far at a carbyne carbon. The compounds are characterized using X-ray crystallography, and their computed energies and magnetic properties reveal aromatic character. Hence, the incorporation of the osmium centre not only reduces the ring strain of the parent pentalyne, but also converts its Hückel anti-aromaticity into Craig-type Möbius aromaticity in the metallapentalynes. The concept of aromaticity is thus extended to five-membered rings containing a metal-carbon triple bond. Moreover, these metal-aromatic compounds exhibit unusual optical effects such as near-infrared photoluminescence with particularly large Stokes shifts, long lifetimes and aggregation enhancement. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84886030423	Understanding the formation of pentagonal cyclic twinned crystal from the solvent dependent assembly of au nanocrystals into their colloidal crystals	Due to the presence of high-density twinned-defects and diffuse elastic strain, pentagonal cyclic twinning (PCT) structures may have more fascinating properties than the corresponding single crystalline structure. Although there are a lot of reports concerning the PCT nanocrystals of many monometals and bimetal alloys, the established growth mechanisms of PCT structures are still not straightforward and usually inconsistent with each other. In this Letter, using dodecanethiol-capped Au nanocrystals (NCs) as building blocks, taking self-assembly of Au NCs into their colloidal crystals as the crystallization model, we found the competition of crystal cohesive energy and surface free energy plays an important role in the formation of PCT colloidal crystal. By rationally selecting the solvent to tailor the crystal cohesive energy, the structure of the colloidal crystals can be tuned. PCT structures are more likely to form when the interaction between building blocks is weak, while the single crystal structure is formed when the interaction is strong. The results demonstrate that the thermodynamic factors are the origin of pentagonal cyclic twinning. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

0141620196	Competitive adsorption and surface alloying: Underpotential deposition of Sn on sulfate-covered Cu(111)	We report an in situ scanning tunneling microscopy study on Sn underpotential deposition (UPD) on sulfate-covered Cu(111) electrode surfaces, which represents a system of anion adsorption in an extreme situation in terms of anion-anion and anion-substrate interactions. Owing to the strong sulfate adsorption, the UPD is initiated with "parasitical" adsorption of Sn adatoms almost exclusively along the periphery of the sulfate adlayer, as manifested in the appearance of brightened Moiré structure modulation at the terrace edge. A Sn-induced local enhancement of tunneling is offered to explain the brightening of the Moiré structure. The initially deposited Sn adatoms displace the sulfate ions from the edge and push themselves toward the interior region of the terrace, maintaining the brightened Moiré pattern at the forefront sites. Consequently, a region free of sulfate is provided for further Sn deposition. In addition to terrace edge reshaping, surface alloying is confirmed by the course-dependent anodic stripping, in which the Sn-covered region of the terrace (excluding the forefront sites) becomes fragmented. The surface alloying is favored, in view of strain relief, by the expanded topmost layer of the reconstructed Cu(111). The overall deposition process may be complete within a time window of several minutes. The present work reveals that when anion-substrate and anion-anion interactions are sufficiently strong and comparable to adatom-substrate interaction, the formation of metal adlayer is severely restricted and novel features of UPD are displayed.

Due to the presence of high-density atomic steps and edges and abundant unsaturated coordination sites, micro- and nanocrystallites with high-energy surfaces usually exhibit greater reactivity than those with low-energy surfaces. However, high-energy crystal surfaces are usually lost during crystal growth as the total surface energy is minimized. Therefore, the selective exposure of high-energy facets at the surface of micro- and nanocrystallites is an important and challenging research topic. Metal oxides play important roles in surface-associated applications, including catalysis, gas sensing, luminescence, and antibiosis. The synthesis of metal oxide micro- and nanocrystallites with specific surfaces, particularly those with high surface energies, is more challenging than the synthesis of metal crystals due to the presence of strong metal-oxygen bonds and diverse crystal structures.In this Account, we briefly summarize recent progress in the surface-structure-controlled synthesis of several typical metal oxide micro- and nanocrystallites, including wurtzite ZnO, anatase TiO

84899644314	Organic-inorganic interface-induced multi-fluorescence of MgO nanocrystal clusters and their applications in cellular imaging	Surface functionalization of inorganic nanomaterials through chemical binding of organic ligands on the surface unsaturated atoms, forming unique organic-inorganic interfaces, is a powerful approach for creating special functions for inorganic nanomaterials. Herein, we report the synthesis of hierarchical MgO nanocrystal clusters (NCs) with an organic-inorganic interface induced multi-fluorescence and their application as new alternative labels for cellular imaging. The synthetic method was established by a dissolution and regrowth process with the assistance of carboxylic acid, in which the as-prepared MgO NCs were modified with carboxylic groups at the coordinatively unsaturated atoms of the surface. By introducing acetic acid to partially replace oleic acid in the reaction, the optical absorption of the produced MgO NCs was progressively engineered from the UV to the visible region. Importantly, with wider and continuous absorption profile, those MgO NCs presented bright and tunable multicolor emissions from blue-violet to green and yellow, with the highest absolute quantum yield up to (33±1) %. The overlap for the energy levels of the inorganic-organic interface and low-coordinated states stimulated a unique fluorescence resonance energy transfer phenomenon. Considering the potential application in cellular imaging, such multi-fluorescent MgO NCs were further encapsulated with a silica shell to improve the water solubility and stability. As expected, the as-formed MgO@SiO

84902251467	Atomic layer-by-layer deposition of Pt on Pd nanocubes for catalysts with enhanced activity and durability toward oxygen reduction	An effective strategy for reducing the Pt content while retaining the activity of a Pt-based catalyst is to deposit the Pt atoms as ultrathin skins of only a few atomic layers thick on nanoscale substrates made of another metal. During deposition, however, the Pt atoms often take an island growth mode because of a strong bonding between Pt atoms. Here we report a versatile route to the conformal deposition of Pt as uniform, ultrathin shells on Pd nanocubes in a solution phase. The introduction of the Pt precursor at a relatively slow rate and high temperature allowed the deposited Pt atoms to spread across the entire surface of a Pd nanocube to generate a uniform shell. The thickness of the Pt shell could be controlled from one to six atomic layers by varying the amount of Pt precursor added into the system. Compared to a commercial Pt/C catalyst, the Pd@Pt

84917727637	Pd-Cu bimetallic tripods: A mechanistic understanding of the synthesis and their enhanced electrocatalytic activity for formic acid oxidation	This article reports a facile synthesis of Pd-Cu bimetallic tripods with a purity over 90%. Two requirements must be met in order to form tripods: i) formation of triangular, plate-like seeds during the nucleation step and ii) preferential deposition of atoms onto the three corners of a seed during the growth step. In this synthesis, these requirements are fulfilled by adding CuCl 2 and KBr into an aqueous synthesis. Specifically, it is demonstrated that the Cu atoms resulting from underpotential deposition could greatly reduce the energy barrier involved in the formation of triangular seeds with planar defects because of the much lower stacking fault energy (41 mJ•m

84920563143	Mussel-inspired, ultralight, multifunctional 3D nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel	Inspired by marine mussel, an ultralight, three dimensional (3D), and nitrogen doped graphene aerogel (NGA) is developed by virtue of dopamine (DA). DA undergoes self-polymerization that can functionalize the graphene surface and also embeds nitrogen atoms onto the graphene sheets upon pyrolysis. The morphology and textural properties were investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectrum. By adjusting the amount of graphene oxide and DA in the precursor mixture, NGA with a density as low as 1.9 mg cm-3 can be prepared. The resultant NGA is macroscopic-assembled, mechanically stable, and fire-resistant. It has very high adsorption capacity and efficient space utilization towards oil uptake, thereby prompting practical applications as a suction skimmer in marine oil spillage or chemical leakage recovery. The high conductivity and 3D interconnected porous structure of the NGA permit good performance as electrode material for electrochemical sensors.

0842299405	Synthesis of α-tellurium dioxide nanorods from elemental tellurium by laser ablation	Elemental tellurium was evaporated by laser ablation, the vapor of which was condensed and deposited on the surface of the heated glass surface and then formed α-tellurium dioxide nanorods with uniformly size distribution by oxidation in the chamber with hot air atmosphere. TEM images and Electron diffraction (ED) pattern confirm the crystallinity of α-phase tellurium dioxide. The formation process of the nanorods involves a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) following a chemical oxidation in the hot air atmosphere, in which the low melting point tellurium serves as a liquid-forming reagent. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.
