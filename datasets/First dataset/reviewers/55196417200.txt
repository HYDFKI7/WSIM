8744305676	Deadlock-free scheduling strategy for automated production cell	Deadlock must be avoided in a manufacturing system. In this paper, an efficient algorithm for finding an optimal deadlock-free schedule in a Manufacturing System with very limited buffer is presented. This algorithm is based on the effective Genetic Algorithm (GA) search method, and a formal Petri net structure is introduced to detect the token player assuring deadlock-free. In order to make the scheduling strategy generated by GA meet the required constraint of deadlock-free, Petri net is involved to make the implementation of the job scheduling in an FMS deadlock-free.

14044268702	An effective hybrid optimization approach for multi-objective flexible job-shop scheduling problems	Scheduling for the flexible job-shop is very important in both fields of production management and combinatorial optimization. However, it is quite difficult to achieve an optimal solution to this problem with traditional optimization approaches owing to the high computational complexity. The combining of several optimization criteria induces additional complexity and new problems. Particle swarm optimization is an evolutionary computation technique mimicking the behavior of flying birds and their means of information exchange. It combines local search (by self experience) and global search (by neighboring experience), possessing high search efficiency. Simulated annealing (SA) as a local search algorithm employs certain probability to avoid becoming trapped in a local optimum and has been proved to be effective for a variety of situations, including scheduling and sequencing. By reasonably hybridizing these two methodologies, we develop an easily implemented hybrid approach for the multi-objective flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP). The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is a viable and effective approach for the multi-objective FJSP, especially for problems on a large scale. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

14744293195	Strong bisimilarity on the π-nets	This paper builds up the strong bisimilarity on π-nets. π-net is a new modular high-level Petri net based on the semantics of the π-calculus which combines the advantages of Petri net and the π-calculus. The concurrency semantics of π-nets is not only true concurrency but also interleaving. The strong bisimilarity on π-nets addresses the study of its interleaving semantics. Differing from the other approach of strong bisimilarity on standard Petri nets, the bisimilarity on π-nets is based on the labeling operational rules of π-nets, and computed straightly by π-nets themselves instead of markings. It is shown that for any π-net, there is a process P such that Ψ(P) is bisimilarity to N, where Ψ is the system equivalence from π-calculus to π-nets.

17744385369	A deadlock-free scheduling method for automated manufacturing systems using dynamic-edge graph with tokens	The deadlock-free scheduling problems of automated manufacturing systems are discussed in this paper. A new dynamic-edge graph with tokens is designed to model the AMS, to identify distinct part flows, to represent the states and capture the concurrent behavior of the AMS and then an efficient algorithm based on the graph-theoretic approach and genetic algorithm for finding optimal deadlock-free schedules in the automated manufacturing systems is presented. The scheduling problem introduced in this paper consists in sequencing the job operations on resources to avoid the deadlock situation and to minimize the makespan. With the help of dynamic-edge graph models of automated manufacturing systems, a deadlock avoidance policy is proposed to supervise the release and acquisition of resources. In order to satisfy the deadlock-free constraint of chromosomes, the proposed deadlock avoidance policy is imbedded into the decoding procedure of genetic algorithm to reschedule the gene sequences and in the fitness computation procedure, a penalty item for the infeasible solution is involved to prevent the search process from converging to the infeasible solution. The scheduling problems for some automated manufacturing systems with special structures are also discussed.

17744392715	Deadlock-free scheduling in automated manufacturing systems with multiple resource requests	This paper addresses the scheduling problem of a class of automated manufacturing systems with multiple resource requests. Each operation may need more than one resource type and multiple identical units with the same resource type. The scheduling problem is formulated by Timed Petri nets model under which the scheduling goal consists in sequencing the transition firing sequence in order to avoid the deadlock situation and to minimize the makespan. In the proposed genetic algorithm with deadlock-free constraint, a deadlock detection method based on D-siphon technology is addressed to reschedule the sequence of transitions. The enabled transitions should be fired as early as possible and thus the quality of solutions can be improved. In the fitness computation procedure, a penalty item for the infeasible solution is involved to prevent the search process from converging to the infeasible solutions. The method proposed in this paper can get a feasible scheduling strategy as well as enable the system to achieve good performance. Numerical results presented in the paper show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2004 IEEE.

17444394785	Frequency response power function of PWM DC/DC converter (part I)	Frequency response characterization is a principal tool for sensitivity analysis an open loop and closed loop stable system. The small signal average and classical sampled-data models are suitable ways of measuring the sensitivity of a converter system at low frequencies. However they are not a suitable means of characterizing a system when there is significant amplitude of ripple exist in the system output and also the validity of the model is limited to he half of sampling frequency. In this paper after an introduction to the notion of frequency response of lifted system, we will introduce the idea of frequency response power function for the time lifted system. Frequency response power function will provide an extended mean to characterize a system with large ripples. Later we will develop the expressions for estimating the frequency response power function of an open and closed loop converter system. Several examples have been given to demonstrate the advantages of present notion of frequency response power function.

17644400504	Fuzzy rule based genetic algorithm and its application in FMS	Most of the FMS (flexible manufacturing systems) problems belong to NP-hard (non-polynomial hard) problems. The facility layout problem and job-shop schedule problem are such examples. GA (genetic algorithm) is applied to get an optimal solution. However, traditional GAs are usually of low efficiency because of their early convergence. In order to overcome the shortcoming of the GA a fuzzy rule based GA is proposed, in which a fuzzy logical controller is introduced to adjust the value of crossover probability, mutation probability and crossover length. The HGA (hybrid genetic algorithm), which is integrated with a fuzzy logic controller, can avoid premature convergence, and improve the efficiency greatly. Finally, simulation results of the facility layout problem and job-shop schedule problem are given. The results show that the new genetic algorithm integrated with fuzzy logic controller is excellent in searching efficiency.

19644369641	Deadlock-free scheduling method for automated production cell including buffer	Deadlock must be avoided in a manufacturing system. In this paper, an efficient algorithm for finding an optimal deadlock-free schedules in a Manufacturing System with very limited buffer is presented. First, the deadlock problem and its graph theory representation is introduced. Then based on the effective genetic algorithm (GA) search method, the graph theory is introduced to assure deadlock-free. In order to make the scheduling strategy generated by GA meet the required constrains, a deadlock detection procedure based on graph theory is involved as a condition to select deadlock-free scheduling, or to allocate the buffer. So the feasible scheduling result is obtained while the main performance indicator is guaranteed. Finally, a case is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

0009125768	Genetic algorithm approach to job shop scheduling and its use in real-time cases	In this paper we present a GA (Genetic Algorithm) approach combined with the concept of GT (Group Technology) to solve the job shop scheduling problems. The main idea is to organize all these jobs into groups using GT and solve such a group scheduling problem with GA. Due to the similarities between jobs within a group, scheduling (a group) can be treated easily as if it is a flow shop problem. Since the complexity of the problem has been simplified, the time spent in finding a feasible scheduling of the whole problem can be decreased. Ideas of using GA in real-time cases are discussed and explored. In particular, the concept of using a near-optimal evolution generation n* in GA is introduced. The value of n* is related to the desired performance index, and using n* in GA may ensure more effective searching. An illustrative example is given at the end of the paper.

3142526813	Chaotic network attractor in packet traffic series	This paper extracts the chaotic network attractor from actual measured packet traffic series of TCP type. Both the analysis on aggregated traffic series and packet arrival interval series can show similar chaotic properties. Further investigation on different time scales shows that the attractor can exhibit different geometric shapes. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the phase space reconstructed shows that the dominant dimensions count decreases as time scale increases. When the time scale is small enough, there are at least 3 or 4 state variables dominate the network dynamic behavior while only one at large time scales. Same tests on UDP traffic series also show similar chaotic behaviors but with slightly difference. Comparison between actual measured traffic and surrogate traffic generated by four popular traffic models shows that the current widely used traffic models like the Poisson arrival traffic model, the deterministic chaotic-map model, the FBM-based model and the independent wavelet model cannot capture such network behaviors. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

For extending the spread of solutions as quickly and fully as possible, the scalarizing functions defined by a wide diversified set of weights are used to go through all regions in objective space in the first phase at each generation. In the second phase, for intensifying search ability and achieving global exploration, a grid-based method is used to discover the gaps on existing tradeoff surface, and a fuzzy local perturbation is employed to reproduce additional "good" individuals in the missing areas. Both the exploitation and exploration are made dynamic and adaptive to online optimization conditions based on a function of progress ratio, ensuring better stability of the algorithm.

33749666941	A novel energy-aware TDMA scheduling algorithm for wireless sensor networks	In wireless sensor networks, time division multiple access (TDMA) -based MAC can eliminate collisions, hence save energy and guarantee a bounded delay. However, the slot scheduling problem in TDMA is an NP problem. To minimized the total slots needed by a set of data collection tasks and saving the energy consumed on switching between the active and sleep states, a novel particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based scheduling algorithm called PSOSA is proposed in TDMA sensor networks. This algorithm can take full advantage of the searching ability of PSO, which is powerful for solving NP problems. Simulation results show that PSOSA requires less slots and energy to finish a set of data collection tasks. Moreover, compare with coloring algorithms, PSOSA have more flexibility to deal with a multi-objective optimization problem. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

33751509315	Supplier selection with multiple criteria in volume discount environments	Supplier selection is a multi-criteria decision making problem which includes both qualitative and quantitative factors. In order to select the best suppliers it is necessary to make a trade-off between these tangible and intangible factors some of which may conflict. When business volume discounts exist, this problem becomes more complicated as, in these circumstances, buyer should decide about two problems: which suppliers are the best and how much should be purchased from each selected supplier. In this article an integrated approach of analytical hierarchy process improved by rough sets theory and multi-objective mixed integer programming is proposed to simultaneously determine the number of suppliers to employ and the order quantity allocated to these suppliers in the case of multiple sourcing, multiple products, with multiple criteria and with supplier's capacity constraints. In this context, suppliers offer price discounts on total business volume, not on the quantity or variety of products purchased from them. A solution methodology is presented to solve the multi-objective model, and the model is illustrated using two numerical examples. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33846646885	A TDMA scheduling scheme for many-to-one communications in wireless sensor networks	In wireless sensor networks, time division multiple access (TDMA)-based MAC can potentially reduce the delay and provide real-time guarantees as well as save power by eliminating collisions. In this kind of MAC, a common energy-saving strategy is to allow the sensors to turn their radio off when not engaged. However, too much state transitions between the active and sleep modes would also waste energy. In order to save this part of energy and further improve the time performance, a multi-objective TDMA scheduling problem for many-to-one sensor networks is presented. An effective optimization framework is then proposed, where genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are hybridized to enhance the searching ability. Simulation results with different network sizes are given. Three algorithms are used for comparisons, which are PSO algorithm, max degree first coloring algorithm and node based scheduling algorithm. It is shown that the proposed hybrid algorithm is superior over these three algorithms on a specified objective, which can be the total time or the total energy for data collection. In addition, the results reveal that the proposed optimization framework can flexibly deal with a multi-objective optimization problem. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33847319222	Optimal distributed resource allocation in a wireless sensor network for control systems	Wireless technology is applied increasingly in networked control systems. A new form of wireless network called wireless sensor network can bring control systems some advantages, such as flexibility and feasibility of network deployment at low costs, while it also raises some new challenges. First, the communication resources shared by all the control loops are limited. Second, the wireless and multi-hop character of sensor network makes the resources scheduling more difficult. Thus, how to effectively allocate the limited communication resources for those control loops is an important problem. In this paper, this problem is formulated as an optimal sampling frequency assignment problem, where the objective function is to maximize the utility of control systems, subject to channel capacity constraints. Then an iterative distributed algorithm based on local buffer information is proposed. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively allocate the limited communication resource in a distributed way. It can achieve the optimal quality of the control system and adapt to the network load changes. © Springer-Verlag 2007.

Moreover, as FMS is a complex asynchronous concurrent system, its model also should have the abilities to express the concurrency in the system and to analyze the behavior of the system. It is difficult to use any one method to model such a complex system as FMS. A modeling method using object-oriented modeling language - unified modeling language (UML) and object-oriented Petri nets (OPNs) is proposed. Class diagram in UML is used to represent the static relations among the objects in FMS. OPNs are used to model the dynamic behavior of the objects and conduct performance analysis. OPNs also can be used to identify the attributes and operations of the objects. The model can describe the system integrally and can be used to design FMS control software naturally.

32344439000	Flexible fuzzy priority scheduling of the can bus	With the increasing complexity of distributed real-time systems, the need for improved CAN bus performance is continually increasing. Normally, a scheduling scheme with static-priority has low network schedulability/utilization; while using dynamic priority will improve the QoS of the network at the cost of a narrow service range or a high overhead, compared with the fixed priority scheduling schemes. Actually, because of the fluctuation of network traffic, these priority policies may not guarantee flexibility for different kinds of messages. Based on the broadcast nature of the CAN bus, a closed-loop fuzzy scheduling scheme is proposed in this paper. Compared with the dynamic priority schemes, this fuzzy scheduling scheme uses fewer bits to encode fewer priority levels, which widens the service range of the network without increasing overhead. Based on game theory, a fuzzy parameter updating algorithm for the fuzzy scheme is developed to improve the adaptation of the scheme, which guarantees the required QoS of the network even with traffic fluctuation. Simulation results well demonstrate the abilities of the fuzzy scheme to guarantee high schedulability for real-time messages, as well as the fairness and the same QoS for non-real-time messages in networks.

33645749765	A hybrid fine-tuned multi-objective memetic algorithm	In this paper, we propose a hybrid fine-tuned multi-objective memetic algorithm hybridizing different solution fitness evaluation methods for global exploitation and exploration. To search across all regions in objective space, the algorithm uses a widely diversified set of weights at each generation, and employs a simulated annealing to optimize each utility function. For broader exploration, a grid-based technique is adopted to discover the missing nondominated regions on existing tradeoff surface, and a Pareto-based local perturbation is performed to reproduce incrementing solutions trying to fill up the discontinuous areas. Additional advanced feature is that the procedure is made dynamic and adaptive to the online optimization conditions based on a function of improvement ratio to obtain better stability and convergence of the algorithm. Effectiveness of our approach is shown by applying it to multi-objective 0/1 knapsack problem (MOKP). Copyright © 2006 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.

52349093010	Business performance forecasting of convenience store based on enhanced fuzzy neural network	Reliable business performance forecasting of convenience store (CVS) can not only help in making the correct local selection decision but also in decreasing the store cost and thereby enlarging the profit significantly. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to design an enhanced fuzzy neural network (EFNN)-based predictor to forecast the business performance of CVS. Without considering relevant domain knowledge, traditional fuzzy neural networks suffer from the problem of low accuracy of forecasting unseen examples. Moreover, traditional fuzzy neural networks have to turn weights with a kind of time-consuming gradient steepest descent training algorithm. Considering the relationship between the evaluation factors globally, we devise the EFNN which assigns connection weights based on the expert domain knowledge without painstakingly and repeatedly turning them. Furthermore, by generating and refining the activation function based on genetic algorithm, our EFNN can provide comprehensive and accurate activation functions and fit a wider range of nonlinear models. By experimenting our methods with several benchmark methods, the proposed methods are found to have an optimal accuracy in forecasting the business performance of CVS with a permanent good performance. © 2007 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

It affects the traffic management and congestion control greatly and proposes new challenges to the robust control of large-scale networks. This paper introduces a new feedback network model to investigate the phase transitions other than the cellular automata model used in the past. The experiments show that the resource competition and delay feedback in traffic flow control play important roles on the emergence of phase transitions. The transition points are also proved to be in sensitive to network sizes in the simulation. The criterion of the phase transition points and the boundaries of the link's bandwidth utilization near these points are also studied. The packet's increasing rate, decreasing rate and the switching probability between these two policies are three key factors affecting network behaviors. The network can be adjusted to just below the critical point by these three factors to get better performance and resource utilization while still keeping it stable.

0035689965	A generalized framework for sampled-data model analysis of closed-loop PWM DC-DC converter system	In spite of the fact that, sampled-data models of PWM dc converter systems (PDCS) are more accurate and natural, little effort has been made to use sampled-data techniques for stability analysis and synthesis of closed-loop PDCS. Instead, averaged models are typically used for control loop design, while detailed simulations are used for validating closed-loop performances. Recent developments in sampled-data control have resulted in new powerful tools for analysis and synthesis of periodic-system. Time lifting of continuous time signals/systems is one of such tools. In this paper, we will introduce a generalized framework for sampled-data analysis of dc-dc converter system based on continuous time lifting of signal/system. This framework will provide an adequate ground to tackle the hybrid nature of these systems. It has been shown that the general discrete-time model of a PDCS is equivalent to a time-lifted model for this class of systems and closed loop PDCS local stability problem can be described by an equivalent time-lifted system, which is finite rank linear discrete-time problem. Hence well-established analysis techniques in sampled-data control can instantly be applied for analysis of these systems. A system composed of two parallel buck-converters has been analyzed to demonstrate the proposed framework.

0035695485	Modeling PWM dc-dc converter as discrete input/continuous output system and its application to system local controllability	Periodic nature is always overlooked whenever power stage of a PWM dc-dc converter is modeled as averaged or sampled-data system. So these models are not suitable for studying a generalized system in cascade to the converter-power-stage. As a result, the former studies of the system local controllability or observability were always application oriented. In this paper we have modeled the power stage of converter as, a discrete-input continuous-output linear system. Our way of obtaining the linear model is more direct than former sampled-data approaches. As an application of this model we have presented for the first time (as authors knowledge concerned) a simple test depending on the converter parameters alone to verify the controllability of any linear system in cascade (which possibly can be a controller) to it. Our success in obtaining a controller independent test for controllability lies in modeling of dc-dc converter in more natural way. Examples have been granted to validate the results.

0036477797	A function-based approach for modelling multi-module PWM DC-DC distributed converter systems	Large signal modelling of distributed converter systems is complicated by the fact that the number of switch combinations involved in circuit operation forces it to assume many different topologies. This paper proposes a simple sampled-data technique for modelling distributed DC-DC PWM converter systems (DCS). The model obtained is nonlinear and can be linearized for analysis and design of DCS. The notion of time-lifted system introduced in the sampled-data control system has been adopted to represent the system in a more compact and appropriate form, and each converter module is represented as a continuous-time lifted system. As the input and output of DC-DC converters vary slowly, a suitable model for the distributed power system model can be obtained in terms of the finite-order input/output approximation. A parallel converter system composed of two buck converters has been taken example to demonstrate the validity of the proposed model.

79960269658	Deadlock-free assignment of wafer processing in photolithography equipment - By using a CPN model	Cluster tools are widely used in wafer fabrication nowadays. Photolithography equipment, the most expensive equipment in wafer fabrication, is comprised of a serial of cluster tools. So far, there has been much research on the assignment of wafers processing in photolithography equipment. Since a production lot may include several kinds of wafer with different routes and the sequence order of wafers in a lot is stochastic, deadlock may occur at any time. Hence, we are not able to determine a schedule before the production batch starts; instead, we need a deadlock-free wafer dispatching method that can not only complete the requested wafer routine procedures but also reduce the total makespan. Here, we employ a transition digraph to check the occurring deadlock and a coloured Petri net (CPN) approach to model the photolithography equipment to ascertain clearly the system state via identification of the kind of wafers situated on respective positions and obtain a smooth and satisfactory control for the executed process. The employed CPN model is a timed high-level Petri net. Also, a well known CPN Tool (http://wiki.daimi.au.dk/cpntools/cpntools. wiki) is used for model editing, simulating and analysing. Accompanied by the photolithography equipment model built, a deadlock-avoidance supervisor is designed to ensure wafer deadlock-free dispatching at each step. This graphic model is easy to understand and can be extended to more complex cases. © 2010 The Institute of Measurement and Control.

The total solution requires a simultaneously combined approach to avoid the possible conflicts between the two sets of individually obtained solutions. A strict mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that integrates part type selection and machine loading together is formulated. The MIP takes into account the constraints such as magazine capacity, tool life, available machine time, etc. The objective is to minimize the difference between maximum and minimum workloads of all the machine resources in each batch. A genetic algorithm-based method is developed to obtain the solution of the problem effectively. Concepts of virtual job and virtual operation are introduced in the encoding scheme, and a chromosome is composed of both these strings. Among each chromosome, the partition symbol list is mainly used to handle the part type selection problem, while the virtual job list mainly used to cope with the loading problem. Special crossover and mutation operators are designed to adapt to the problem. Our approach can simultaneously balance the workloads in different batches. At last, illustrative examples are presented, and a comparison between standard MIP algorithm and a genetic algorithm method is given.

0036880711	Regularization of queuing network serviced by servers	The paper considers a general switched flow network in which the job queuing network is controlled by several servers and each server is shared by a group of nodes. The jobs come from outside system at a random rate. One server selects a buffer among its respective group of nodes and removes the jobs in the buffer at different speed, and sends to a unique buffer at the downstream node. When bounded or periodic statistics rules are met by these random arriving jobs, a sufficient condition for the considered system to be of regular behavior is given.

0036946532	The application of two-level cache in RAID system	In RAID system, cache is one of the important factors that can affect general system performance. As two-level cache usually brings better performance than one-level cache in the processors of personal computers and embedded systems, a two-level cache system that exploits both temporal and spatial localities effectively is proposed as the cache structure for RAID system. The proposed cache system consists of two layers of caches, i.e., a set associative cache with small block size and a fully associative spatial cache with large block size. According to the results of simulation, the hit ratio and hit times can be improved with the two-level cache structure.

0036955174	A branch and bound approach for earliness and tardiness penalty problem with distinct due dates	In this paper, a single machine, n-job scheduling problem, in which each job has a distinct due date and equal earliness and tardiness coefficients, is studied.

By combining it with an existing lower bound estimation scheme, a fast branch and bound approach for optimal schedule is proposed. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the new method.

0141750712	Fuzzy Reasoning Petri Nets	This paper presents a fuzzy reasoning Petri net (FRPN) model to represent a fuzzy production rule-based system. The issues of how to represent and reason about rules containing negative literals are addressed in the proposed PN model.

0344877245	Avoiding unsafe states in manufacturing systems based on polynomial digraph algorithms	A deadlock-free unsafe (DFU) state of Resource Allocation System (RAS) is deadlock-free but inevitable to enter a deadlock state. Previous research revealed that in many special systems, DFU states do not exist and polynomial deadlock avoidance policy (DAP) using one-step look ahead algorithms can avoid deadlock states. This paper first establishes the NP-completeness on determining the existence of DFU states. Then, giving necessary conditions of DFU states based on diagraph analysis, it provides polynomial avoidance policies that inhibit loading new jobs to avoid DFU states. Further-more, this method is generalized to mixed capacity systems and systems with flexible routings. Examples and simulation results are also presented.

0345308355	The application and verification of Banker's algorithm for deadlock avoidance in flexible manufacturing system with spin	This paper presents a method for deadlock avoidance algorithm used in Flexible Manufacturing System(FMS). This method is an improvement of the Banker algorithm. The Banker algorithm is commonly used in the Operating System (OS), but some improvement will have to be made on the algorithm if this algorithm is used in FMS.

84904245937	A computation and control architecture of virtual manufacturing shop	Virtual manufacturing (VM) is a model for an integrated application of manufacturing system. In this paper, only the information infrastructure of manufacturing shop is considered. The system architecture, modelling and analysis, include simulation and control software, can be tested and operated on a platform of distributed computer system (DCS). Generally, a client/server LAN with enough attached measurement/control terminals would be sufficient to imitate all the mechanisms and activities of such a manufacturing information system. A more extensive concept of VM that may include virtual product designing and virtual business operating is not covered in this work. © 2001 by Springer Science+Business Media New York.

10444228060	Deadlock-free scheduling in automated manufacturing systems with multiple resource requests	This paper addresses the scheduling problem of a class of automated manufacturing systems with multiple resource requests. In the automated manufacturing system model, a set of jobs is to be processed and each job requires a sequence of operations. Each operation may need more than one resource type and multiple identical units with the same resource type. Upon the completion of an operation, resources needed in the next operation of the same job cannot be released and the remaining resources cannot be released until the start of the next operation. The scheduling problem is formulated by Timed Petri nets model under which the scheduling goal consists in sequencing the transition firing sequence in order to avoid the deadlock situation and to minimize the makespan. In the proposed genetic algorithm with deadlock-free constraint, Petri net transition sequence is coded and a deadlock detection method based on D-siphon technology is proposed to reschedule the sequence of transitions. The enabled transitions should be fired as early as possible and thus the quality of solutions can be improved. In the fitness computation procedure, a penalty item for the infeasible solution is involved to prevent the search process from converging to the infeasible solution. The method proposed in this paper can get a feasible scheduling strategy as well as enable the system to achieve good performance. Numerical results presented in the paper show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

10644294019	Allocating criterion for periodic hard-real-time task in multiprocessor systems	This paper considers the schedulability of a set of independent periodic hard-real-time tasks scheduled on identical multiprocessor systems, in which tasks are not permitted to migrate between processors and fixed preemptive priority. The tasks are assigned on an available individual processor according to the Rate Monotonic priority and the RM schedulable condition. Three allocation criterions being characterized by the number, sequence and utilization sum of task set were proposed. The new conditions are prior to a previous criterion given by the threshold of the worst case achievable utilization sum. The examples and analysis show the new methods are efficient.

0742290180	Deadlock-Free Scheduling Strategy for Automated Production Cell	Deadlock must be avoided in a manufacturing system. In this paper, an efficient algorithm for finding a good deadlock-free schedule in a manufacturing system with enough (sufficient) or limited buffer is presented. This algorithm is based on the effective genetic algorithm (GA) search method. A formal Petri net structure is introduced, and the token player is used to assure deadlock freeness. In order to make the scheduling strategy generated by GA meet the required deadlock-free constraint, a Petri net is involved in checking the implementation of a manufacturing system during the job-scheduling process. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach is illustrated by several examples.

11844282854	New scheme of bandwidth allocation for networked control systems	According to the characteristics of the cyclic-service networks and the real-time requirements of three different kinds of data, periodic data, time-critical data and time-available data, the conditions of network stability are analyzed. A new bandwidth allocation scheme of dynamic sharing the time windows is proposed, which not only satisfies both requirements of real-timeliness and network stability, but also decreases the required buffer capacity and makes full use of the network resources. Furthermore, the effects of the bandwidth allocation of time-available data on the system performances are analyzed by simulation tests. It is shown that by proper choice of the bandwidth of time-available data both two kinds of bandwidth allocation of time-available data could guarantee the better performance of Networked Control Systems (NCSs).

12144273166	Building block coded parallel genetic algorithm and its application in TSP	If the building blocks can be found and treated as the gene units that compose the chromosomes, shorter chromosomes can be produced in evolution. In this article, the Building-block Coded Parallel Genetic Algorithm (BCPGA) was introduced, which is based on the coarse-grained parallel GA. In this approach, the best individuals are collected from the distributed groups every after a period of evolution. From these elites the possible building blocks are identified and treated as gene units to recode the elites. Then the building block coded elites become the initial group of a new period of evolution. The procedure is recycled in the evolution process. A 100-city Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is used in the experiment that confirms the improved efficiency of the BCPGA.
