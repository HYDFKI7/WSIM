84942367710	Influence of horizontal damage size of grating ridge on the optical properties of multilayer dielectric gratings	Based on typical laser damage morphologies of multilayer dielectric gratings (MDGs), in this paper the influence of horizontal damage size of the grating ridge on optical properties of MDGs is analyzed by numerical calculations using the rigorous coupled wave analysis method. From simulation results, the optical performance of MDGs decreases with the increase in horizontal damage size of the grating ridge. But the maximum electric field value in the grating ridge and the multilayer enhances constantly with the increase in horizontal damage size, thus inducing further laser damage of MDGs. This paper provides the preliminary study for functional damage of MDGs.

14944379600	Enhanced dill exposure model for thick photoresist lithography	Thick photoresist lithography is one of the most important techniques for micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS). In order to design and manufacture the novel and complex MEMS elements with a high aspect ratio, low cost and higher efficiency, it is necessary to develop a simulation approach for the thick photoresist in lithography process. However, the nonlinear factors presented in the thick photoresist during the exposure process affect the final resist profile severely. The conventional Dill model, which is suitable for describing the thin photoresist exposure process, will cause great deviations from its experiment results when it is used directly to thick photoresist exposure process. In this paper, an enhanced Dill model for the thick photoresist exposure process is presented. This model takes into account of the effects caused by the light diffraction or the scattering in the thick photoresist and the change of photoresist refractive index in the exposure process. The exposure parameters of thick photoresist AZ4562 have been extracted by experiment measurements with the aids of theoretical analysis. The simulation results of the latent exposure profile under the different exposure conditions for photoresist AZ4562 have been given with the enhanced exposure model. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The setup is devised by directly etching gratings into the bottom side of a prism so that light can successfully enter (or exit) the compression grating. Dependence of the -1 order diffraction efficiencies on the constructive parameters is analyzed for TE- and TM-polarized incident light at Littrow angle by using Fourier modal method in order to obtain optimal grating structure. The electric field enhancement within the high-efficiency TIR gratings is regarded as another criterion to optimize the structure of the TIR gratings. With the criterion of high diffraction efficiency, low electric field enhancement and sufficient manufacturing latitude, TIR compression gratings with optimized constructive parameters are obtained for TE- and TM-polarized incident light, respectively. The grating for TE-polarized light exhibits diffraction efficiencies higher than 0.95 within 23 nm bandwidth and relatively low square of electric field enhancement ratio of 5.7. Regardless of the internal electric field enhancement, the grating for TM-polarized light provides diffraction efficiencies higher than 0.95 within 42 nm bandwidth. With compact structure, such TIR compression gratings made solely of fused silica should be of great interest for application to chirped pulse amplification (CPA) systems. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

40749107765	Design of reflection resonant grating filters	Resonant grating filters based on grating abnormality have attracted much attention in recent years owing to their high peak reflectivity, low sideband reflection and controllable line width of central wavelength. Some special characteristics which are hard to be achieved by multilayer stack alternated with high and low refractive indices can be realized with guide-mode resonance of sub-wavelength gratings whose line width of central wavelength can be compressed to less than one nanometer under the condition of weak modulation of gratings. However, the sideband reflections near or far from the central wavelength are still somewhat high due to Fresnel reflection between air and material. According to the effective medium theory (EMT), sub-wavelength waveguide gratings can be viewed as thin films. In this paper, the sideband reflections of resonant grating filters are effectively reduced through antireflection design based on thin film theory and narrow band resonant filters are attained in the range of visible wavelength with good characteristics.

84866651086	Influence of two typical defects on the near-field optical properties of multilayer dielectric compression gratings	Internal electric-field enhancement is critical for the laser-induced damage properties of multilayer dielectric compression gratings (MDG) in high-energy laser systems. Due to the complex fabrication processes of MDGs, such as coating, interference lithography, etching, and cleaning, different kinds of defects in multilayers or profiles onMDGsurfaces can't be practically avoided. Combined with a scanning electron microscope of some MDG samples, line-absence and added node seem to be two typical defects, according to which two defectiveMDGmodels are established, and numerical calculations are performed. From simulation results, the defect period and defect depth has little effect on the spectral response of the optical elements. However, they may produce large changes of internal electric-field distribution on the grating surface and even in multilayer structures, thus decreasing the damage threshold of MDG. To obtain a better understanding of the dependence of the internal electric-field enhancement on these defects, this work is focused on the near-field distributions of defective MDGs using the Fourier model method. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

Besides, the effective medium theory is accurate for evaluating the diffraction efficiency within the error of less than 1% when the higher order diffraction waves other than zero order wave is not to propagate. In addition, the limitation of scalar diffraction method and effective refractive index method is dependent on not only the normalized period of surface profile but also the normalized groove depth. © 2009 Optical Society of America.

It is demonstrated that the narrow line width transmission filters can be abstained with only two different materials. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH All rights reserved.

79551625077	Extreme ultraviolet single photon-counting imaging system based on induced charge position-sensitive anode	A new prototype of two-dimensional photon-counting imaging system with an induced charge position-sensitive anode in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) region was developed for a moon-based EUV camera. The detector system is mainly composed of microchannel plate (MCP) stacks operating in a pulse-counting mode, a wedge-strip induced-charge position-sensitive anode and correlative analog and data processing circuits. A three-electrode wedge-strip induced-charge position-sensitive anode with a 1.5 mm period and a 47 mm diameter active area was designed and fabricated, and the front-end analog and data circuits with the maximum counting rate of 200 kHz were also developed. The operating characteristics of the prototype MCP detector including the background rate, pulse height distribution, gain, image linearity and the spatial resolution were measured. The measured results show that the spatial resolution has been 7.13 lp/mm(0.14 mm), which means it can completely satisfy the requirement of moon-based EUV camera for the spatial resolution.

80955130227	Influence of geometry variations and defects on the near field optical properties of pulsed compression gratings	The internal electric field enhancement is critical for the laser induced damage properties of pulse compression gratings (PCG) in high-energy laser systems. Due to complex fabrication processes of PCG such as coating, interference lithography and etching, different kinds of defects, like nodular defects in multilayers and non-uniformities of the grating profiles on PCG surface, can't be practically avoided. From simulation results, we can know that some of these defects have little effect on the spectral response of optical elements, but they may produce huge changes of internal electric fields and thus decrease the damage threshold of PCG. To obtain a better understanding of the dependence of the internal electric field enhancement on these defects and their dimensions, this work is focused on the near field distributions of defective PCGs using rigorous electric magnetic field (EMF) solvers. © 2011 SPIE.

84860896362	Performance test of micro-channel plate photon-counting imaging detector	The structure and working principles of a Micro-channel Plate (MCP) photon-counting imaging detector were introduced, then the dependence of working voltages and temperatures of the MCP on the background events and their influence on the imaging quality of the detector were analyzed. By adjusting the voltage and input light intensity respectively, the output count rates were changed, and by comparing the pulse-heights and the image situations at different output count rates, the optimal state of MCP was chosen. The results for 3 MCPs show that increasing the voltage and input light intensity will allow the output counting rate to be larger, which changes the height distribution curve of the pulse and effects the image definition. It suggests that to choose appropriate voltages, temperatures and light intensity can obtain better height distribution curves and images.

84863176362	Laser-induced damage of multilayer dielectric for broadband pulse compression grating	The multilayer dielectrics (MLDs) for broad bandwidth 800nm pulse compression gratings were fabricated with optimized design by electron beam evaporation using three different kinds of materials (Ta2O5/SiO2/HfO2), which had more than 99% reflectance with bandwidth larger than 160nm around the center wavelength of 800 nm and high transmission at the exposure wavelength of 413nm. Laser-induced damage behaviors of the mirrors were investigated. It was found that the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of the samples could reach 1.0J/cm2 and 2.0J/cm2 in the normal beam (57 degrees, TE mode) at pulse duration of 50fs and 120fs, respectively. The depth information of the damage sites at these two cases was explored by atomic force microscope (AFM). The reason of the sample having so high LIDT was also discussed in this paper. The MLDs provide a solid base for the high laser threshold 800nm pulse compression gratings and may open a new way for broad bandwidth 800nm reflectance coatings used in the ultrashort pulse laser system. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

84869095684	Optimization design of polarizing beam splitter based on metal-multilayer dielectric reflecting grating	In this paper, a reflecting polarizing beam splitter (RPBS) with a metal-multilayer dielectric grating (MMDG) structure is designed by using a genetic algorithm and the Fourier mode method. The proposed RPBS grating can be operated at a central wavelength of 1053 nm. Moreover, this grating can reflect the transverse electric wave in the -1st order and the transverse magnetic wave in the 0th order. The optimized RPBS grating has high extinction ratios of over 20 dB from 1030 nm to 1076 nm at angles ranging from 48.6° to 55.1°. At 1053 nm, the highest efficiency of over 98%, as well as polarization extinction ratios of the 0th order and -1st order at 62.2 dB and 48.8 dB, respectively, is obtained. The optimized MMDG structure shows acceptable tolerances for grating fabrication. This MMDG may be a potential RPBS candidate for use in different optical systems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84872452648	Microchannel plate photon counting detector in UV range	A Microchannel Plate(MCP) photon detector was developed to detect the 30.4 nm radiation in a plasma layer of the earth. By changing voltages, temperatures and other parameters, the variations of the dark noise and resolution for the MCP detector were compared. The results indicate that the dark noise of the detector comes from the ion feedback of residual gas and the thermal noises mainly. Therefore, to reduce the dark noise, the microchannel should be preprocessed by removing residual gases and the detector could not work at a high temperature state. After preprocessing at the room temperature, the dark noise counting rate of the detector has reduced to 0.34 count/s·m

84874499216	High-spectral-resolution characterization of broadband high-efficiency reflection gratings	An optical characterization method with high spectral resolution for broadband, multilayer dielectric gratings working at the -1st reflection order is demonstrated in this paper. The diffraction-efficiency measurement setup for the broadband gratings with high efficiencies mainly consists of a double-light-path system with a monochromator as the illumination source and an automatic rotation stage for incident and diffraction angles adjustment. Two typical practical difficulties, namely (1) the mismatch between the spot size of diffracted light and the limited detector aperture and (2) the shared propagation path between the incident and diffracted light at the Littrow angle, were well solved. A fabricated multilayer dielectric grating was measured on the established measurement setup. Diffraction efficiencies greater than 90% in the wavelength range from 763 to 852 nm were obtained with an average relative deviation less than 1.0%. At the moment, the wavelength resolution is 1 nm and the angle resolution is 0.2 deg. The high-resolution broadband diffraction spectrometry testing method is applicable to characterizing broadband pulse compression gratings in the laser systems. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

84883085511	Optimization of the optical near-field distribution of metal multilayer dielectric gratings for pulse compressors	Metal multilayer dielectric gratings (MMDGs) for pulse compressors used in high-energy laser systems should enable high efficiency, as well as provide broad bandwidths and high laser-induced damage thresholds. The non-uniform optical near-field distribution of MMDGs is an important factor that limits damage resistance capabilities. The efficiency and electric field distributions of MMDGs with a corrugated SiO2 layer and operated at 800 nm are analyzed by rigorous coupled-wave analysis. The maximum electric field in the grating ridge, match layer, and metal layer decreases with increasing grating diffraction efficiency. High efficiency and a low electric field are obtained with a 90° slope angle in the grating ridge. The bandwidth and maximum electric field in the metal layer decrease with increasing high- and low-index material pairs, and the maximum electric fields in the grating ridge and match layer initially decrease and then increase. The peak electric field in the grating is optimized with a merit function; the optimization covers the enhancement of diffraction efficiency, bandwidth, and reduction of electric field. The bandwidth of the optimized MMDGs is 160 nm with a diffraction efficiency exceeding 90%. The largest electric field is modulated in air to obtain a low electric field and high laser-induced damage threshold. © 2013 SPIE.

84885173602	Influence of arched groove bottom on laser-induced damage ofmultilayer dielectric gratings	Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the nanosecond laser-induced damagesoccurring in multilayer dielectric gratings (MDG). The initial damages of MDG locate at grating ridgeswhile the damages with micro-holes and cracks appear in the groove bottom. Compared with the melted-hole damages of grating ridges, the groove bottom crack damages indicate they are the major promotingrole of causing the catastrophic damage for MDG. The damage mechanism and development were dis-cussed combined with the grating structure and the normalized electric field intensity (NEFI). The profileof groove bottom of MDG was explored by atomic force microscope (AFM) in detail. It is found that thebottom shape is arched with the maximum height of 30 nm. Based on these measuring grating param-eters, NEFI of MDG was numerically calculated with finite difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithmto explain the damage phenomenon. The arched bottom makes an enhancement of NEFI maximum ingroove bottom, thereby increasing the risk of catastrophic damage for MDG. According to simulatedresults, flattening groove bottom and/or deeper etching within tolerance allowance range can reduceNEFI maximum and gradient in groove bottom effectively. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

84888112087	Broadband and high resolution spectral measurement technique for pulse compression gratings	Pulse compression gratings based on multilayer dielectric film or metal multilayer dielectric film usually work around the Littrow angle with high diffraction efficiency and broad diffraction band. There is a large requirement to have high resolution and accurate measurement on the grating diffraction spectrum in the purpose of optimizing the fabrication process. Based on the double light paths system, an optical characterization method and the corresponding setup with high spectral resolution for broadband high diffraction efficiency pulse compression gratings are demonstrated. The method to eliminate the influence of the background and the light source fluctuation is discussed in detail. Two practical problems are perfectly settled, including the large spot size of diffracted light which is not completely collected by optical detector and the detector blocking of the incident light near the Littrow angle. The setup can measure the reflection and transmission diffractive spectra for each diffractive order of broadband pulse compression gratings, as well as the angular spectrum with fixed wavelength. The setup can measure the grating diffractive spectrum with resolution of 1 nm and the grating angular spectrum with resolution of 0.2.

84888147314	Effect of polishing plane vibration on large-size optical workpieces in continuous polishing	Effect of the polishing plane vibration on large-size optical workpieces in continuous polishing is studied. The vibration equation was deduced based on the existence of inclination between the polishing plane and z-axis direction. Influences of different parameters, such as the inclination, rotation speeds of the polishing plane and workpiece, the eccentricity and workpiece radius, on the polishing plane vibration were simulated. The simulations results show that rotation speeds of the polishing plane and workpiece is the most significant factor. The chaotic vibration of the polishing plane increases with increasing rotation speeds differences between the polishing plane and workpiece. When differences are small, periodic ups and downs of the polishing plane occur with the increase of polishing time. Experiments verified the influence of rotation speeds differences on the polishing plane vibration. The vibration affects PV of large-size optical workpieces in continuous polishing. © 2013 SPIE.

84903451113	Study on total internal reflection microscopy for subsurface damage	Subsurface damage (SSD) detection and removal play an important role in improving the laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) of optics. A new method to detect the distribution of SSD is proposed. This method combines total internal reflection microscope and digital image processing technology. Because of the limited focal depth of the microscope system, one can get different images focusing at different depth levels by a total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM). The connection between the definition curve of TIRM image sequence and the depth position of SSD is established. Also, the depth length of SSD through the feature of definition curve is obtained. The imaging process of TIRM is simulated and the typical features of the focusing process is found out. Size information of the microstructures is got exactly according to the fabricated microstructures by femtosecond laser micromachining. Focal depth of the microscope determines the test depth accuracy of our method and actually the test accuracy can achieve 1 μm.

Two interferometric methods are analyzed and compared for testing the medium and low spatial wavefront errors of the long focal length lens with an instantaneous interferometer, using large aperture plane mirror and concave mirror as retroflectors, respectively. The two kinds of beam path arrangements are designed using ray tracing method. Wavefront aberration and modulation transfer function are used as merit functions. The reason for their different ability to test the wavefront is also analyzed. To evaluate the feasibility of test methods, tolerances analyses are performed to determine the tolerances demanding the fabrication and assembly of each optical element. It is proved that a relatively short optical path with a large aperture concave mirror is satisfied for testing the medium and low spatial wavefront errors of the transmitted wavefront of the spatial filter.

10844263237	Analysis and simulation of diffractive imaging field in thick film photoresist by using angular spectrum theory	The thick film photoresist lithography is a much more complicated process compared to the thin film photoresist lithography. In this paper, we have developed a new model for lithography of thick film photoresist by using the angular spectrum theory. The thick film photoresist is divided into many homogeneous layers, and the diffractive optical imaging distribution in photoresist is regarded as superposition of different spectrum plane waves. Propagation of each plane wave is determined by the optical transfer function, and the propagation direction, amplitude and phase are dominated by reflection and transmission between each interface of the sub-layers. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) has been converted into a convolution calculation to keep the computation accurate and reduce computation cost. Numerical calculation results show that optical intensity in cross-sect of thick film resist is strongly affected by reflection, transmission on interface and variation of dielectric permittivity along direction of depth, and therefore these factors should be considered while analyzing diffractive imaging field in thick film photoresist. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.
