Cu is implanted into the pores of anodic alumina by means of electroplating. With such metallic array, the alumina film exhibits polarization properties like a wire grid polarizer. At the wavelength of 1.5 μm, the film embedded manifests higher transmissivity and better extinction ratio. The dependence of the polarization properties on anodization and electroplating conditions is also studied. To a certain extent, the extinction is enhancing with the increase of anodic oxidation voltage. With the electroplating current density growing, the polarization property is also increasing because of the growth of metallic columns, but the trend is stopped when the current density is too high to make the Joule heat exhale as quickly as possible and result in the irregularity of the columns.

With such metallic array, the alumina films exhibit optical polarization properties. The experi-ment results indicated that the polarization properties of Cu/PAA film depend on electroplating conditions. To a certain extent, with the increase of electroplating time and current density, the extinction ratio of Cu/PAA film can be improved; the temperature of electroplating solution is an important factor to influence on the ex-tinction ratio, because a higher extinction ratio can be obtained at a smaller density and a higher temperature.

77952875064	Suppressing the disturbance in the transmission spectrum of Glan-Thompson-type prism polarizers	We analyze the random disturbance in the transmission of light through a spinning Glan-Thompson-type prism polarizer. The disturbance makes the dependence of the transmission on the rotation angle significantly deviates from the Malus cosine-squared law and severely spoils the output light quality. Slight vibration of the polarizer as it rotates combing the multi-beam-interference effect raises the disturbance. Further analysis reveals the sensitive dependence of the disturbance on the composing material of the prism gap, and the appropriate selection of such material can make the disturbance minimize to very desirable levels. The model results show quite good agreement with experiments. © 2010 Chinese Optics Letters.

0038711637	A study on transmitted intensity of disturbance for air-spaced Glan-type polarizing prisms	We study theoretically and experimentally the transmission intensity of polarized light through the air-spaced Glan-type polarizing prisms. It is found that the variation of the transmitted intensity with the rotation angle deviates from Malus Law, exhibiting a cyclic fluctuation with the rotation angle. The occurrence of the disturbance is explained by the use of an argument based on the interference effect produced from the air-gap in the prisms. The theoretical results are well agreed with the experimental ones. By selecting the proper cut angle of prism and reducing the thickness of air-gap in prism, the disturbance may be minimized. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

84879704981	Analysis of an improved Lyot depolarizer in terms of the multi-beam superposition treatment	In order to study the depolarization properties of an improved Lyot depolarizer with monochromatic light, the theory of multi-beam superposition is adopted. The dependences of degree of depolarization (D) on vibration azimuth angle (VAA) and total retardation (TR) are analyzed. The results show that D is ideal for any VAA when TR is δ=(N+1/2)π (N is an integer) on the basis of wedge angle large enough. And when δ=Nπ, VAA makes the most significant impact on D. When δ is assigned to the other values, the impact on D made by VAA is between the former two. Using a 405 nm semiconductor laser, experiments for measuring D of the sample with wedge angle of 6° are conducted. The theoretical results are well verified by experiments. D is over 98.8% when TR is nearly δ=(N+1/2)π by changing the incident angle. © 2013 Tianjin University of Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84881001912	Properties of the Fraunhofer diffraction of a plane wave by a circular spiral phase plate	For studying the Fraunhofer diffraction properties of a plane and finite-radius wave by a circular spiral phase plate (SPP), the analytical expression to describe the light intensity of the vortex beam produced by the Fraunhofer diffraction based on the scalar diffraction theory is given. The effects of different parameters on the intensity distribution properties of the vortex beam, such as the topological charge n, the radius R of the circular SPP, are analyzed through theoretical modeling. Theoretical results show that when the radius R of the circular SPP is constant, the radius of the vortex beam would increase with the increasing topological charge n, and the proportion of the sidelobes is also enhanced significantly. However, when the topological charge n is constant, the radius of the vortex beam would decrease with the increasing radius of the circular SPP, and the shape of the vortex beam would remain basically unchanged. The Fraunhofer diffraction of a plane and finite-radius wave by a circular SPP is achieved with a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM), and experimental verifications about the above theoretical results are implemented. The experimental results and theoretical analysis are in good agreement.

84885460660	Study on a novel depolarizer whose optical axes are fan-shaped distribution	A novel birefringent depolarizer whose optical axes are fan-shaped distribution is designed. Using the idea of superposition of transmitted light, the depolarization performance for linearly polarized light is studied. And the formula of degree of depolarization (D) is obtained. The theory shows that D changes periodically with the vibration azimuth angle (VAA) of incident light and optical path difference (OPD) on the basis of large enough wedge angle. D is 100% when VAA takes (N/2) π (N is integer), independent of the OPD. And D is the worst when VAA takes (2N+1) π /4.Adjusting the incident angle is adopted to improve D. The experiment results accord with the theory. And the D value of sample is over 98.84% for any VAA when the incident angle is 4°. So the design is feasible and the research method is so simple and clear that it can provide a new reference for the study of depolarizer.

12444273671	Depolarization effect of magneto-optic crystal GdYBiIG in adjustable magnetic field	The optical system has been established in which the changes of polarization state for magneto-optic crystal can be measured. In this optical system, WGY model semiconductor laser is applied as the light source, and the tuning range of the intensity of magnetic field is 0-1500 mT. Depolarization effect in GdYBiIG crystal which often be used in optical isolator is measured in large variation range of adjustable magnetic field. The experiment result shows that polarization performance will be best in GdYBiIG crystal when it reaches saturated magnetization. And the depolarization effect occurs when the intensity of magnetic field increases over saturation intensity. The principle for magnetic depolarization effect is also given according to the experimental result. It presents that magnetic circle dichroism and magnetic linear birefringence are the reasons which cause depolarization effect. From these results, it is optimum to make sure that the magnetic field should be lager only a little than the saturation intensity of magnetic field.

84923381173	Platelets promote tumour metastasis via interaction between TLR4 and tumour cell-released high-mobility group box1 protein	Increasing evidence suggests that TLR4 expression by tumour cells promotes tumour progression, but it is unclear whether TLR4 is involved in metastasis. Here we show that TLR4 deficiency significantly diminishes experimental lung metastasis without affecting primary tumour growth. Bone marrow transplantation experiment and application of antiplatelet agents in mice demonstrate that TLR4 on platelets plays an important role in metastasis. TLR4 is critical for platelet-tumour cell interaction in vitro. Furthermore, high-mobility group box1 (HMGB1) neutralization attenuates platelet-tumour cell interaction in vitro and metastasis in vivo in a TLR4-dependent manner, indicating that tumour cell-released HMGB1 is the key factor that interacts with TLR4 on platelets and mediates platelet-tumour cell interaction, which promotes metastasis. These findings demonstrate a mechanism by which platelets promote tumour cell metastasis and suggest TLR4, and its endogenous ligand HMGB1 as targets for antimetastatic therapies.
