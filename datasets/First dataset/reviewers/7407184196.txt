84927583927	Formation mechanism and criterion of linear segregation in ZL205A alloy	Abstract The experiments and numerical simulation were conducted for ZL205A aluminum alloy cylindrical shell casting. The formation mechanism of the linear segregation produced by the low pressure die casting (LPDC) process was investigated. And the heat transfer of the casting during solidification process was analyzed by simulation technique, resulting from the information of linear segregation obtained by plenty of experiments. The new linear segregation criterion was proposed through the simulation and experimental results. It was found that the melting metal with high Cu contents was feeding the crack shrinkage formed by the tearing under the effect of feeding pressure during the later solidification, which led to the formation of linear segregation. The control methods for the linear segregation were suggested based on the proposed mechanism. Finally, the criterion of linear segregation was confirmed by the production of the actual castings.

84937779202	Optimization of low-pressure die casting process parameters for reduction of shrinkage porosity in ZL205A alloy casting using Taguchi method	In order to reduce serious tendency of the shrinkage porosity in ZL205A alloy, the design of experiment technique, Taguchi method is introduced to optimize the process parameters of cylindrical shell ZL205A alloy parts produced by low-pressure die casting in this article. The effect of pouring temperature, filling time and packing pressure on the shrinkage porosity in ZL205A castings is investigated using the orthogonal array and Advanced Porosity Model in ProCAST to calculate the volume of shrinkage porosity. The effectiveness of selected casting parameters in reducing the shrinkage porosity in cylindrical shell ZL205A casting is verified through analysis of signal-to-noise ratio and analysis of variance. Numerical results indicate that the optimized process parameters, including a pouring temperature of 725 °C, filling time of 20 s and packing pressure of 175 kPa, can be used to reduce the formation of shrinkage porosity in ZL205A castings.

Formation mechanism of band structure	Solute compositional distributions at and ahead of the solid-liquid interfaces are analyzed during the plane-front growth for both the primary and peritectic phases as single phase and nucleation phase for peritectic alloys directionally solidified at low growth rates from initial transient to steady state.

The free energy densities of solid and liquid used to construct the free energy of a solidification system in the phase-field model were derived from the Calphad thermodynamic modeling of phase diagram. The dendritic growth of Ti-Al alloy with a quasi-sub regular solution model was simulated in both an isothermal and a nonisothermal regime. In the isothermal one, different initial solute compositions and melt temperatures were chosen. And in the non-isothermal one, release of latent heat during solidification was considered. Realistic growth patterns of dendrite are derived. Both the initial compositions and melt temperatures affect isothermal dendritic morphology and solute distributions much, especially the latter. Release of latent heat will cause a less developed structure of dendrite and a lower interfacial composition.

These alloy specimens were prepared by metal mold. By means of microstructure observation, macrostructure observation and electron probe analyzing, microstructure and macrostructure of the specimens were analyzed by comparison method.

The result of numerical simulation shows that the mold filling of vertical centrifugal casting consists of forward-direction filling and back-direction filling. Gas-holes defect easily appears at the entrance of valve. The two orders also exist in solidification process and are major reasons for formation of off-axis shrinkage nearby the side of filling first.

The simulating results show that the fine cells are formed through the destabilization of the initial planar interface. As the growth velocity increases to the growth rate of absolute stability interface, the interface morphology transforms from fine cells to a high-speed planar interface. The investigation of solute distribution pattern indicates the appearance of microstructure of low microsegregation due to solute trapping at the interface.

The results show that the coriolis force plays an important role in the change of melts flow direction. With the action of the centrifugal force and coriolis force, the melts stick one of side of the mould to fill and the side is opposite to the rotational direction. The whole filling process includes two filling parts: forward filling and back filling. During the forward filling process, the sectional area of the mould without the ingate decreases with the increase of filling length, but which is changeable with the increase of the filling length for the mould with ingate.

33947282266	Phase and microstructure selection in directionally solidified peritectic alloys with convection	A boundary layer model was used to investigate the convection effects on phase and microstructure selection in directionally solidified peritectic alloy. Due to the convection effects, the steady-state compositions of one phase at interface corresponding to an initial composition reduce, which causes its steady-state point moves upward along its solidus line and the compositional range is not consistent with the band cycle in banding. A criterion of critical interface temperature was put forward to determine whether a phase entered steady-state growth or not. Furtherly by equivalent transformation, the equivalent solidus lines and subsequent equivalent phase diagram were derived for peritectic solidification with convection. Using this equivalent phase diagram, a phase and microstructure selection map is built for a peritectic alloy with convection effect, which shows that the compositional range for banding reduces, and moves to the hyperperitectic region, and also the coupled growth region of both solids comparing with purely-diffusive limit. The predicted map for directionally solidified Pb-Bi alloy agrees well with its experimental observations.

34547879990	The nonlocal solution of two parallel cracks in functionally graded materials subjected to harmonic anti-plane shear waves	In this paper, the dynamic interaction of two parallel cracks in functionally graded materials (FGMs) is investigated by means of the non-local theory. To make the analysis tractable, the shear modulus and the material density are assumed to vary exponentially with the coordinate vertical to the crack. To reduce mathematical difficulties, a one-dimensional non-local kernel is used instead of a two-dimensional one for the dynamic problem to obtain stress fields near the crack tips. By use of the Fourier transform, the problem can be solved with the help of two pairs of dual integral equations, in which the unknown variables are the jumps of displacements across the crack surfaces. To solve the dual integral equations, the jumps of displacements across the crack surfaces are expanded in a series of Jacobi polynomials. Unlike the classical elasticity solutions, it is found that no stress singularity is present at the crack tips. The non-local elastic solutions yield a finite hoop stress at the crack tips. The present result provides theoretical references helpful for evaluating relevant strength and preventing material failure of FGMs with initial cracks. The magnitude of the finite stress field depends on relevant parameters, such as the crack length, the distance between two parallel cracks, the parameter describing the FGMs, the frequency of the incident waves and the lattice parameter of materials. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

The formation of shrinkage cavity during solidification is simulated by a modified method. With the proposed model, numerical simulations are performed to investigate the influences of mold temperature, mold material, superheat and initial alloy composition on CET. Calculated results reveal that the equiaxed zone is found to expand with decreasing the superheat and thermal conductivity of mold, as well as increasing alloy composition and mold temperature.

Based on the FDM solution of momentum, thermal transport and Maxwell equations, the macro model is used to simulate the fluid flow and heat transfer throughout the casting under electromagnetic field. The micro model is used to predict the nucleation and growth of grains for the vertical central plane. Validity of the model is confirmed by comparison between the result from calculation and it from direct measurement. Numerical simulations are performed to investigate the influences of coil current, duration and heat transfer coefficient at the casting/crucible interface on fluid flow and microstructure formation. Calculated results reveal that the growth of coarser columnar structure is promoted for a longer duration. The variation of coil current has a minor effect on the formation of microstructure. Increasing the heat transfer coefficient generates a coarser cast structure. The main action of electromagnetic field is that a small vortex in the upper part rotates in opposite direction to the buoyancy convection.

The increase of solid composition and the reduction of liquid composition with the increase of growth velocities will cause the gradually uniform distribution of solute because of the appearance of solute trapping ahead of the solid-liquid interface.

However, with the action of centrifugal force and Coriolis force on the melts in the centrifugal field, the cavities can be fully filled with the molten metal. The castability of thin walled titanium alloy castings was influenced by some casting parameters, such as rotational velocity, rotational radius and solidifying rate. Experimental results indicate that the forming ability of thin walled titanium alloy increases with increasing rotational velocity. However, the filling ability of molten metal changes a little with increasing rotational radius. In addition, under the experimental condition used in this paper, the number of internal defects of the thin walled castings decreases with increasing rotational velocity, but increases with increasing rotational radius.

77952222118	Research on mould filling and solidification of titanium alloy in vertical centrifugal casting	The objective of this paper is to study the filling process of titanium alloy melt in vertical centrifugal casting, as well as the effect of processing parameters on the formation of defects of titanium alloy castings. Experimental results show that the castings obtained in the centrifugal field are better than that obtained in the gravity field. The molten metal sticks to one side of the mould which is opposite to the rotational direction to fill in the vertical centrifugal field. And the cross-sectional area of the molten metal in the runner decreases with increasing of filling length, but has a back-up trend at the inlet of ingate due to the decreases of filling velocity at the ingate. The processing parameters such as rotational direction, rotational radius and rotational velocity play an important role in the formation of defects of titanium alloy castings. Different rotational direction leads to different filling sequence of molten metal, which then affect the following solidification and the formation of the defects. Under the given rotational velocity, the volume of inner defects of castings decreases with increasing of rotational radius and rotational velocity.

A model has been established to simulate the forward filling and backward filling process, and two parameters were used to provide a quantitative description of the defect generation that is associated with the forward filling of the mould cavity. One of the parameters used was the forward filling cross-sectional area, and the other was the inclined angle of the free surface of forward filling flow. The cross-sectional area decreases, and the inclined angle increases when the rotational speed increases, the tendency of which becomes more obvious near the mould cavity entrance. The residual volume of the mould cavity after the forward filling is related to the volume of trapped pores. The filling process has also been investigated using numerical simulation. Based on the filling and solidification characteristic of a TiAl valve, the off-centre porosity distribution is also discussed. © 2011 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Maney on behalf of the Institute.

The results showed that the penetration increased with the decrease of frequency and increase of duty cycle, but weld width showed the opposite change tendency. Furthermore, some experiments were implemented to analyze the effect of wire extension length and arc voltage on bead appearance. All of these experimental data could provide proper parameters for the lead arc and the trail arc in tandem SAW using square wave AC and also testified square wave AC was preferred over DC and traditional 50Hz AC. The square wave AC power source could be applied widely in tandem SAW. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

0037003218	Numerical simulation of mold filling during centrifugal casting of TiAl alloy exhaust valve	In this paper, the numerical simulation of the mold filling process for TiAl alloys exhaust valve castings was performed. The relationship between melt cross-section area during mold filling, free surface inclined angle and mold filling distance was derived. Based on the analysis of the force exerted on the liquid during centrifugal casting and the Navier-Stokes equation of liquid flow and the equation of continuity, a numerical simulation model for the mold filling process of centrifugal casting of TiAl alloy exhaust valves was developed. A mold filling experiment of centrifugal casting was carried out using paraffin as the simulation fluid. The actual data of melt cross-section area and free surface inclined angles of fluid at different rotation speed were obtained. The comparison shows that the results of simulation agree with those of experiments.

0038444286	Numerical simulation of off-centred porosity formation of TiAl-based alloy exhaust valve during vertical centrifugal casting	The vertical centrifugal casting method has been used to cast a TiAl-based alloy exhaust valve. Although mould filling and solidification of TiAl-based alloy melt proceed under pressure generated by the centrifugal force, an unfavourable solidification sequence is formed because of the special mould filling mode and finally results in the formation of off-centred porosity. Numerical simulation is applied to study the vertical centrifugal casting process of the TiAl-based alloy exhaust valve in this paper. On the basis of simulations of the flow field and the temperature field, the law of porosity formation during the vertical centrifugal casting of the TiAl-based alloy exhaust valve is discussed by analysing the mould filling and solidification process. The results of the numerical simulation show that off-centred porosity forms easily near the entrance of the cast product and the tendency for off-centred porosity formation decreases with increasing distance from the entrance to the far end. The experimental results agree well with those of the numerical simulation.

84867882169	Research on mould filling process of melt in vertical centrifugal casting	Mould filling of melt in vertical centrifugal casting is a complex process, which is governed by a number of processing variables. In this paper, a complete analysis of mold filling process of melt in vertical centrifugal casting is accomplished by combining theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experiments. Results show that the melt fills the cavity with varying cross-sectional area and inclined angle. The filling process is divided into two steps in vertical centrifugal casting: forward filling and back filling. The cross-sectional area decreases and the inclined angle increases with increasing of the rotational velocity during forward filling. Moreover, the filling process of liquid has been simulated based on SOLA-VOF technique. The comparison between the experimental and the numerical results shows good agreement.

The results show that the desirable temperature filed can be obtained and tendency of shrinkage porosity in the defect location of the shell can be reduced by using the chill and riser, adding the number of slit runners from eight to ten and decreasing the length of feeding distance from 200 mm to 157 mm. Comparison with the experimental results indicates that the scheme of chill combining with riser is reasonable and feasible.

84870263390	Evaluaton model for the geometry complexity of casting based on fuzzy theory	The parameters that describe the complex degree of a certain casting are of some uncertainty. Therefore, a new method based on the fuzzy theory to classify the complex degree of castings has been presented in this paper. The feasibility of fuzzy theory in describing the complex degree of castings has been discussed and the procedure of this method has been specified by analyzing the complex degrees of some typical castings. The element factors that influence the casting complexity, have been summarized, which include the wall-thickness and the number of transition surface, etc. The results show that it is reasonable and practicable to classify the complex degree of castings with the fuzzy theory.

84871004603	Solidified structure of thin walled and complicated titanium castings during vertical centrifugal casting process	Solidified structures of thin walled and complicated titanium castings during vertical centrifugal casting (VCC) process have been studied in this paper. The macro-structure and grain size at different process schemes were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The aim of the present paper is to establish quantitative relationships between the grain size of the casttitanium components and the casting wall thickness. The paper includes comprehensive investigation of the microstructure during the VCC process. The results show that the centrifugal rotational velocity has much bigger effect on the microstructure of thicker wall parts. The cooling rate of the castings has more effect on the grain size distribution of the castings over the centrifugal rotational velocity.

84878056748	Mold filling behavior of titanium melt in thin-walled and complicated cavities in hypergravity field	The mold filling process of titanium alloy in the thin-walled and complicated cavities in hypergravity field is the subject of this paper. The obtained results indicate that the filling process of the melt in the thin-walled and complicated cavity at different mould rotational speeds is quite complex. The free surface of the melt in the thin-walled ribs moves forward in a near planar way parallel to the gravity direction under different mould rotational speeds. The mold filling process with higher filling rotational speed, 300rpm and 500rpm shows that the free surface in the thin-walled ribs and backward filling in the radial runners are in the same vertical plane. Besides, the speed of backward filling in the radial runner is equal to that in the thin-walled ribs. The free surface during the backward filling process at the rotational speeds of 300rpm and 500rpm is a series of arc surfaces, while the free surface during backward filling with 150rpm is not obvious, for the free surface during the forward filling process occupies nearly the whole radial runner.

84879154150	2-D boundary-fitted coordinate grid generation for casting with complex shape	In order to overcome the zigzag grids generated by conventional finite difference method on complicated casting boundaries in the simulation of casting process, the generation program for 2-D boundary- fitted coordinate grid has been developed by solving a set of partial differential equations (PDE) numerically. The STL format files were treated as input data for 2-D physical regions. The equipartition method for boundary points was used to improve the self-adaptability of grid according to the characteristic of the STL format files. The program was demonstrated through some examples. The comparison between the conventional finite difference method and the proposed method shows that this program is effective and flexible for generation of boundary-fitted grid in any arbitrary 2-D complex domain, and the grid is in accordance with the variety of boundary curvature finely. The program also provides two types of boundary-fitted grids for double-connected region, O-type and C-type. The limitation of the step-like boundary with the rectangle grid could be avoided effectively. Therefore, the computational accuracy and efficiency would be improved and the computational time would be saved significantly by the application of boundary-fitted grids.

84880825820	Optimization of tilt- casting of aluminum alloy automobile drain pipes through numerical simulation	The effect of major parameters, such as pouring temperature, tilt time and preheating temperature of mold, on the tilt casting of aluminum alloy automobile drain pipes is studied through numerical simulation using single factor and orthogonal test methods. The simulation results of single factor test indicate that the increase in the pouring temperature and mold preheating temperature could effectively reduce the shrinkage tendency and the shortage of tilt time would cause lower temperature gradient of casting at the beginning of solidification, thus would lead the extension of solidification time. And the results of orthogonal test showed that the sequence of factors having effect on the filling and solidification process, are pouring temperature, tilt time and preheating temperature of mold. Finally, combined the result of single factor test with orthogonal test, an optimized tilt-casting process was proposed by investigating the velocity distribution at each stage of the filling process and the isolated area distribution of liquid phase in the solidification process, and by predicting the position of porosity in the casting. The effectiveness of the proposed process parameters in producing high quality castings is also proved through numerical simulation. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84880838379	Numerical simulation of bubble migration in liquid titanium melts under hypergravity field	Bubble migrations in liquid titanium melt under hypergravity field is modeled using commercial computational fluid dynamics software FLUENT 6.3 (Fluent inc., USA). The two-phase fluid model, incorporated with the Multiple Reference Frames (MRF) method is used to predict the movement of the bubble in the melt. Simulated results are compared with experimental data from the water model measurement and reasonable agreements are obtained. Furthermore, the computed results show that the bubble migration under hypergravity field includes the movement forward to the casting rotating shaft and the movement opposite to the direction of the rotating mould. In addition, the initial bubble size and the surface tension between the melt and the gas bubble have an important effect on the distortion of the bubble. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84890111447	Macrosegregation in vertical centrifugal thin-walled and complex tc4 castings	This study investigated the macrosegregation in the thin-walled and complicated TC4 castings manufactured by a VCC (vertical centrifugal casting) process. The segregation mechanism and the effect of macrosegregation on the microstructure have also been studied. The results show that there is a trend of segregation in complicated casting produced by vertical centrifugal casting process. The macrosegregation at the thick-walled parts of the casting with complicated geometry shape is much obviously than that at the thin-walled parts of the casting. The cooling rate of the casting is the main factor to the formation of macrosegregation. The cooling rates at the thick-walled parts are much lower than that at the thin-walled parts, and the elements diffuse much more sufficiently at the thick-walled parts and the phase segregation occurs, therefore, there ultimately existed slightly elemental macrosegregation at thick-walled parts © 2013 Advanced Study Center Co.

The results show that the shape of bubbles exhibits spherical structure at initial stage of formation, and the bubble departure diameters are in proportion to aperture of stator disc. The bubbles morphology is changed from initially spherical to elliptic in ascending process which rises along the curve. In the process, the bubbles may present the phenomenon of chasing coalescence growth and collision coalescence growth.

84892553480	Bubbles formation and movement during refining process of aluminum alloy by rotary pulse ventilation, part two, numerical simulation	The bubbles movement during refining process of aluminum alloy by rotary pulse ventilation was analyzed, and the motion behavior of bubbles in the liquid was simulated by using the numerical simulation with the model of VOF to analyze the effects of liquid properties on the bubbles formation and ascending process. The results show that the bubbles experience nucleation and growth process. The bubbles exhibit spherical structure at the initial stage of nucleation, and the shape of the bubbles is changed from spherical to ellipsoidal during the subsequent process of detachment and growth. With the increase of viscosity, the shape of the bubbles tends to be spherical, and the curvature running track tends to be straight line. Meanwhile, with the increase of surface tension, the bubbles are increasingly difficult to be deformed, leading to the bubble collapsed later, even not broken.

84897380607	The influence of melt hydrogenation on Ti600 alloy	In this paper, melt hydrogenation, which is a new hydrogen treatment method, was used to hydrogenate Ti600 alloy, the relationship between the hydrogen partial pressure and the hydrogen content was built by analyzing experimental data, and microstructure was observed and mechanical properties was tested. It was found that hydrogen addition made the thickness of the solidified shell thinner and a big temperature gradient existed from the top to bottom surface of the alloy melt. With increasing hydrogen partial pressure, the directional solidification structure can be formed in the Ti600 alloy ingots. Microstructure of Ti600 alloy was modified significantly and the amount of α′ and β phases after melt hydrogenation. When increasing the content of hydrogen to 7.2 at.%, γ hydride was obtained in Ti600 alloy. The flow stress and yield stress decrease with increasing the hydrogen content. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

12844284806	Evolution of unidirectional solidification microstructure of the Al-In monotectic alloys in high temperature gradient	High temperature gradient is employed under the directional condition to examine the influence of the ratio of gradient to solidification rate, G/R, on the microstructure of Al-17.5%In (mass fraction) alloys. The experimental results show that the microstructure evolution of monotectic alloy under the directional solidification is similar to the one of eutectic alloy. When steady growth is formed, there exists an In-rich zone in the front of α phase and vice versa. The diffusion process plays a dominate role in the steady growth due to the small lamella distance. Unidirectional solidification microstructure of the alloys changes from fibrous structure to regular droplet-like array and finally random dispersion of In droplets in the aluminum matrix with increasing growth rate or decreasing temperature gradient. The change suggests that the transition of monotectic solidification structure has a closed relation to the morphological transition of solid-liquid interface.
