2342495358	An integrated user authentication and access control scheme without public key cryptography	Conventionally, user authentication and access control are two separate security mechanisms in many distributed systems. An integrated design of user authentication and access control may provide better performance in terms of security and computational complexity. This paper discusses the pros and cons of the separate approach and the integrated approach, and then proposes a new integrated scheme without using public key cryptography. The new scheme has several practical merits - no user-sensitive data stored on the server, no storage for access list or capability list on the server, extreme low computational cost, the freedom of choosing users' passwords, and mutual authentication.

33744462119	A remote authentication scheme preserving user anonymity	Many smart card-based remote authentication schemes have been proposed, due to its convenience and secure computation of the smart card. However, these schemes didn't protect the users' identities while authenticating the users, even though user anonymity is an important issue in many e-commerce applications. In 2004, Das et al. proposed a remote authentication scheme to authenticate users while preserving the users' anonymity. Their scheme adopted dynamic identification to achieve this function. This article points out Das et al.'s scheme fails to protect the user's anonymity, and propose a new scheme to conquer the weakness. © 2005 IEEE.

33845437589	Identity-based key agreement protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks using bilinear pairing	As ad hoc wireless networks require less or no fixed infrastructure support, communications among nodes can be quickly and adaptively constructed. This property ensures that ad hoc wireless networks are especially suitable for communications in critical application such as military, emergency and rescue missions. In this paper, we design and evaluate a security framework for multilevel ad hoc wireless networks with unmanned aerial vehicles. Our design, based on identity-based public key infrastructure using bilinear pairing, consists of group key management architecture, static pair-wise communication, tripartite key agreement, and group key agreement. Compared to its counterparts, our design reduces the certificate validation process, improves computational efficiency and reduces storage requirement. © 2006 IEEE.

34547852396	Effective and efficient approach to web accounts management and authentication minimizing password compromise risk and possible loss	Using distinct and high-entropy passwords in different accounts is a good principle for security, but it is very inconvenient or even impractical for many users because it is very difficult for people to memorize several distinct, high-entropy passwords. Therefore, despite the high risks, many users are still apt to use simple passwords or even a single password in many accounts for its convenience. Contrary to the conventional inconvenient approach that requires users memorize high-entropy passwords and periodically change them, this paper proposes and implements a new approach to managing the password accounts so as to minimize the possible passwordcompromise risk and the loss caused by compromised passwords while keeping the convenience and the scalability. This approach well integrates with existing systems and incurs only minimum cost.

However, all of the previous ultralightweight authentication schemes are vulnerable to various attacks. In this paper, we propose a new ultralightweight RFID authentication protocol that provides strong authentication and strong integrity protection of its transmission and of updated data. The protocol requires only simple bit-wise operations on the tag and can resist all the possible attacks. These features make it very attractive to low-cost RFIDs and very low-cost RFIDs. © 2007 IEEE.

38149123347	ID-based key agreement with anonymity for ad hoc networks	Security support is a must for ad hoc networks. However, existing key agreement schemes for ad hoc networks ignore the issue of entity anonymity. Without anonymity, the adversary can easily identify and track specific entities in the communications. Not only entities' movement information is valuable to the adversary but also the adversary can launch heavy attacks on those important nodes, based on the information. This paper proposes an ID-based n-party (n ≥ 2) key agreement scheme that preserves entity anonymity from outsiders. The scheme is efficient and very suitable for the structure-free mobile ad hoc networks. The security of the schemes is proved in a modified Bellare-Rogaway model. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2007.

43249114174	Fast pre-authentication with minimized overhead and high security for WLAN handoff	User mobility in WLANs becomes more and more popular because of wide deployment of WLANs and numerous applications on it. Some of these applications, for example multimedia applications, require fast handoffs among access points to maintain the quality of service. In order to support multimedia applications for roaming users, IEEE 802.11i defines pre-authentication to reduce the re-authentication delay. The primary drawback of IEEE 802.11i pre-authentication is that the fall 802.1x/EAP authentication consumes too much overhead. In this paper, we propose a new fast pre-authentication scheme that greatly improves the efficiency and achieves high security level.

By the way, we also point out the forgery attack on Xia-You recently published group signature scheme. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

46749107236	Selectively convertible authenticated encryption in the random oracle model	Conventionally, a verified digital signature releases information about both the signing event and the signed content simultaneously, where the signing event proves the truth that someone actually signed something. However, in many cases, the information of the signing event and the signed content have different uses and distinct degrees of importance on various occasions. In such cases, the conventional digital signature, the current authenticated encryption schemes and the current signcryption schemes cannot satisfy the needs of selectively releasing either the information about the signing event or that about the signed content or both depending on the situation. In this paper, we shall propose a selectively convertible authenticated encryption scheme where either the sender or the designated receiver can selectively convert the encryption such that the signing event and that of the signed content can be released adaptively . The security of the scheme is proved in the random oracle model. Applications based on the proposed scheme are also introduced. © The Author 2008.

Yet, these public terminals are susceptible to the fake terminal attack, where the attackers set up fake terminals and steal sensitive information. Therefore, we should authenticate these terminals before using them. To fight against the fake terminal attack, we shall propose a strong hybrid approach. Our solution is capable of reducing the number of secret databases maintained by the server, alleviating the load of storing the public keys of all the terminals put on the storage-limited device, and simplifying the long interaction steps that previous methods have.

In this paper, we propose a highly efficient ID-based ring signature from pairings that requires only one pairing operation, which is the least complexity among its counterparts. Additional merits of the scheme include (1) no requirement of admissible encoding function like the MaptoPoint [2], and (2) parallelism of computing operations of the ring signature generation. © 2008 IEEE.

67649204709	Secure fast wlan handoff using time-bound delegated authentication	To support multimedia applications with good quality of services for roaming wireless local area network users, it is imperative to reduce the long re-authentication latency that users experience during handoff among access points (APs). Athough a great deal of research resources have been put into the reduction of the re-authentication latency, these schemes developed so far seem to either suffer from heavy overhead problems or have weak security. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reducing the re-authentication latency. With the authentication server (AS) periodically delegating its authentication authority to the authenticated APs, the APs can authenticate the roaming users on behalf of the AS. As our performance analysis and simulation results demonstrate, our new approach is capable of greatly reducing the latency and overhead while achieving a high security level. Furthermore, it does not increase the complexity on the AP side because only the already existing four-way handshake with new keying mechanism is required. ©2008 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.

67650677035	An efficient and scalable key distribution mechanism for hierarchical wireless sensor networks	Many applications of wireless sensor network (WSN) require secure data communications, especially in a hostile environment. In order to protect the sensitive data and the sensor readings, secret keys should be used to encrypt the exchanged messages between communicating nodes. Traditional asymmetric key cryptosystems are infeasible in WSNs due to the low capacity of each senor node. In this paper, we propose a new key pre-distribution scheme for hierarchical WSNs. Compared to some of the existing schemes, our methods possess the following features that are particularly beneficial to the resource-constrained large-scale WSNs: (1) it can fully defend against the node captured attack, (2) it minimizes the storage and communication overhead, and (3) it provides full connectivity of the network.

This proof has found several interesting applications. However, in the existing RFID yoking schemes, the computational cost of identifying a tag in the back-end server is O(N), where N is the number of tags. This paper proposes a tree-based yoking-proof scheme, which employs the tree structure to organize the tags and treats the dynamically updated paths of tags as the secrets to identify the tags. This arrangement results in great improvement of only O(1) computational cost to identifying the tag. © 2009 IEEE.

In order to protect the sensitive data and the sensor readings, secret keys should be used to encrypt the exchanged messages between communicating nodes. Traditional asymmetric key cryptosystems are infeasible in WSNs due to the extremely low capacity and constrained resources at each senor node. Recently proposed protocols are either vulnerable to the large-scale node capture attacks or lack of performance scalability in terms of storage, communication and computation costs. To address these limitations, we study the key pre-distribution schemes in this paper and propose a new one with all of the following properties which are particularly beneficial to the large-scale resource-constrained WSNs: (1) it completely defends against the node capture attacks, (2) it provides full connectivity of the network, and (3) it reduces the storage and communication overhead significantly compared with the other proposals. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

68849120029	ECC-based lightweight authentication protocol with untraceability for low-cost RFID	Due to the potential wide deployment of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), the security of RFID systems has drawn extensive attention from both academia and industry, and the RFID authentication protocol is an important mechanism in the security of RFID systems. The desired security requirements of RFID authentication protocols include privacy, integrity, authentication, anonymity/untraceability, and even availability. To design an efficient protocol that satisfies all the requirements with limited resources is a challenge. This paper proposes a new RFID authentication protocol based on Error Correction Codes (ECC). The proposed scheme has excellent performance in terms of security, efficiency, server's maintenance, robustness, and cost. The tag only performs simple operations, such as random number generation and simple bitwise computations. The lightweight feature makes it attractive to those low-cost RFIDs that support only simple operations. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper proposes a practical time-bound key assignment scheme, which is efficient and is proved secure. We, based on the time-bound hierarchical key assignment scheme and XML security, design and implement a new E-newspaper publication.

In such circumstances, pressing one's fingerprint instead of typing passwords and carrying personal smart cards is much more convenient, safer and more practical.

78751517298	Enhancing convenience and situation-aware intelligence of smart home services using passive RFID and intelligent controls	Smart home services have been quite popular for some time and many kinds of technologies can be applied to enhance smart home services. Conventionally, active radio frequency identification (RFID) has been widely used in smart home services to identify users, and there was less consideration for intelligence in these services. However, it is inconvenient and costly for users, as carrying active tags requires battery recharging, is costly and can be bulky. Distinct user preferences and complex situations call for more system intelligence. A new approach is to utilise passive RFID like (EPC Gen 2 and MIFARE) as these have several advantages. This includes no battery requirement, low cost, light-weight sizes, moderate storage, and a moderate reading range. In this paper, we design an intelligent smart home system that integrates passive RFID and a smart engine along with other technologies to enhance the cost-effectiveness, convenience, safety, comfort and intelligence of smart home services. Prototyping and field-testing demonstrate that the proper application of passive RFIDs (like Gen2 and MIFARE) and intelligent controls into existing smart home services improves the services in several aspects.

78751657441	ABAKA: An anonymous batch authenticated and key agreement scheme for value-added services in vehicular ad hoc networks	In this paper, we introduce an anonymous batch authenticated and key agreement (ABAKA) scheme to authenticate multiple requests sent from different vehicles and establish different session keys for different vehicles at the same time. In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), the speed of a vehicle is changed from 10 to 40 m/s (36-144 km/h); therefore, the need for efficient authentication is inevitable. Compared with the current key agreement scheme, ABAKA can efficiently authenticate multiple requests by one verification operation and negotiate a session key with each vehicle by one broadcast message. Elliptic curve cryptography is adopted to reduce the verification delay and transmission overhead. The security of ABAKA is based on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, which is an unsolved NP-complete problem. To deal with the invalid request problem, which may cause the batch verification fail, a detection algorithm has been proposed. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficiency merits of ABAKA through performance evaluations in terms of verification delay, transmission overhead, and cost for rebatch verifications, respectively. Simulation results show that both the message delay and message loss rate of ABAKA are less than that of the existing elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA)-based scheme. © 2010 IEEE.

0036335479	Authenticated encryption schemes with message linkages for message flows	Two efficient authenticated encryption schemes with message linkages are proposed. One is a basic scheme, that it has the better performance in comparison with the all previously proposed schemes in terms of the communication and the computation costs. However, it has a property as same as the previously proposed schemes, that the message blocks can be recovered only after the entire signature blocks have been received. Therefore, the basic scheme is applicable to encrypt all-or-nothing flow. Thus, we improve the basic scheme and also propose a generalized scheme, which allows the receiver to recover the partial message blocks before receiving the entire signature blocks. That is, the receiver may perform the receiving and the recovering processes simultaneously. Therefore, the generalized scheme is applicable to message flows. The generalized scheme requires smaller bandwidth and computational time as compared to the previously proposed authenticated encryption schemes with message linkages for message flows. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

79959770845	Two RFID-based solutions to enhance inpatient medication safety	Owing to the low cost and convenience of identifying an object without physical contact, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems provide innovative, promising and efficient applications in many domains. An RFID grouping protocol is a protocol that allows an off-line verifier to collect and verify the evidence of two or more tags simultaneously present. Recently, Huang and Ku (J. Med. Syst, 2009) proposed an efficient grouping protocol to enhance medication safety for inpatients based on low-cost tags. However, the Huang-Ku scheme is not secure; an attacker can easily make up fake grouping records to cheat the verifier. This weakness would seriously endanger the safety of inpatient medication safety. This paper will show the weaknesses, and then propose two RFID-based solutions to enhance medication safety for two different scenarios. The proposed schemes are practical, secure and efficient for medication applications. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Key management is one of the crucial considerations for achieving secure multicast. This paper presents an efficient ECC-based key management scheme for secure multicast in heterogeneous sensor networks. In the proposed scheme, each sensor node only stores one secret key that is used to efficiently derive the session key without extra communication overhead. As compared with previous work, the proposed scheme can easily handle the case of adding/revoking several sensor nodes in the deployed network if necessary.

This paper extends OpenID authentication mechanism by sharing user attributes between identity providers and Relying Party (EPCIS in this application), and integrates the extended OpenID with EPCISs. This integrated platform allows a user with only one single OpenID account to access EPCISs of different domains around the globe, and each EPCIS can authorize applicable access rights to the users, based on the local policy and the user's attributes delivered from Identity Provider.

0036853884	A unified approach to secret sharing schemes with low distribution cost	In secret sharing schemes, the secret holder has to distribute secret shares to each participant before distributing the secrets. To distribute or redistribute shares is a very costly process with respect to both time and resources. Unlike previous works, where different approaches are proposed for different scenarios, we propose a unified approach for both threshold-based schemes and generalized group-oriented cryptosystems. This unified implementation has the following merits: (1) With a unified approach, the implementation requires much less overhead than its counterparts when various secret sharing problems are simultaneously involved; (2) The Secret Holder (SD) does not need to redistribute new secret shares after the secret reconstruction; (3) The SD can, dynamically and efficiently, determine the capacities (weight) of each user on recovering the secrets, and the threshold values of the secrets; (4) To dynamically adjust the capacities of users, the SD does not need to refresh the shadow of each user and each user just memorizes one secret shadow.

As compared with the certificate-based signature scheme with message recovery, the public space and the communication cost are reduced. Moreover, we also present two variants based on the proposed scheme. One is an authenticated encryption scheme that only allows a specified receiver to verify and recover the message.

In this article, we first show the weakness of some existing protocols against the session key compromise, and then propose a new and efficient inter-domain authentication protocol. Based on public key, challenge-response and hash chaining, this new approach simultaneously achieves several practical merits: (1) good scalability, (2) low communication cost and low computational cost, and (3) resistance to the session key compromise attack. © 2002 Elsevier Inc.

84876217093	Provably secure gateway-oriented password-based authenticated key exchange protocol resistant to password guessing attacks	A Gateway-oriented Password-based Authenticated Key Exchange (GPAKE) scheme allows a client to establish an authenticated session key with a gateway via the help of an authentication server, where the client has pre-shared a password with the server. The desirable security properties of a GPAKE include session key semantic security, key privacy against servers, and password guessing attacks resistance. Abdalla et al.'s scheme (Asiacrypt 2005) [1] proposed the first GPAKE scheme, and then Abdalla et al. [13] and Byun et al.'s [2] had respectively proposed their improvements to enhance the security. Unfortunately, we find that all the improved schemes fail to commit the security requirements. In this paper, we point out security weaknesses of the improved scheme. To enhance the security, we propose a new GPAKE scheme, and prove its security in an enhanced model.

84880287877	Comments on IMBAS: Identity-based multi-user broadcast authentication in wireless sensor networks	In 2008, Cao et al. proposed an identity-based multi-user broadcast authentication scheme (called IMBAS) for wireless sensor networks. The IMBAS consists of one elliptic curve-based signature scheme, called variant of Bellare-Namprempre-Neven' Identity-Based Signature (vBNN-IBS), for user broadcast authentication; a new Schnorr signature with partial message recovery for sink broadcast authentication; and a password-based private key protection to eliminate the threat caused by possible user device compromise. Compared with its counterparts, IMBAS owns better performance in terms of security, scalability, and efficiency. Unfortunately, this letter will show that (1) the password-based protection scheme and the vBNN-IBS scheme are not secure-a compromised user device will disclose the user private key-and (2) the new Schnorr signature with partial message recovery is vulnerable to existential forgery attack. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84883234825	Combining Rabin cryptosystem and error correction codes to facilitate anonymous authentication with un-traceability for low-end devices	Abstract Secure authentication of low cost Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) with low computing capacity is a big challenge, due to the constraint of the limited resources and the privacy concern of their mobility and traceability. Here, we not only concern authentication but also privacy (anonymity and un-traceability) to protect privacy of these mobile devices and their holders. In this paper, we delicately combine Rabin cryptosystem and error correction codes to design lightweight authentication scheme with anonymity and un-traceability. Compared to its previous counterpart [4], the proposed schemes improve the number of supported tags from O(k) to O(2

0141927192	Improved authenticated multiple-key agreement protocol without using conventional one-way function	An authenticated multiple-key agreement protocol enables two entities to authenticate each other and establish multiple common keys in a two-pass interaction, and a protocol without using a conventional hash function simplifies its security assumption on only public hard problem. In 2001, Yen et al. proposed an improved multiple-key agreement protocol to overcome the attacks that break the previous variants. However, the authors show that an impersonator can easily forge message without being detected, and can establish common session keys with the communicating party. To overcome all the weakness, we propose an improved scheme that also achieves better key utilization, compared to the previous variants. © 2002 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

0141972441	New hierarchical assignment without Public Key cryptography	The access privileges in many distributed systems can be effectively organized as a hierarchical tree. Distributing distinct cryptographic keys to distinct entities, according to their privileges, provides a good solution to the hierarchical access control problem. Many existing key assignment schemes use public key cryptography, which requires lots of costly public key operations and thus leads to a limited degree of deployment. In this paper, we shall propose a new key assignment protocol that employs only a low cost smart card with little memory to perform simple arithmetic operations. Our approach greatly reduces the computational load and the implementation cost. Compared with Lin's scheme, which is a very efficient scheme without using any public key cryptography, our new scheme further reduces the computational cost by as much as 66% and the quantity of public data by 50%.

84888211710	On the revocation of proxy signatures	A proxy signature scheme with warrant allows the designated proxy signer to sign documents on behalf of the original signer within the specified time period. Recently, Lu et al. proposed a proxy signature scheme with revocation where a verifier can be assured that a proxy signature was really generated at the authorized time period. This article will show that a proxy signer may generate the signature beyond the authorized time period but claims he did It at the authorized time period, and a proxy signer may repudiate to take his responsibility on his signatures In Lu et al.'s scheme. Several simple amendments are presented and discussed.

84888222437	ID-based E-will system using bilinear pairings	Our life is so vulnerable and erratic that oftentimes we can hardly react to the changes immediately. Preparing a "Will" in advance is the only way for the deceased (or a testator) to communicate with close relatives. The traditional living wills are usually in the form of a document, which has to be signed, sealed, and witnessed to confirm its validity. We integrate the Internet and information security technologies, using bilinear pairings function and the identity-based public key system to establish a holographic will system and a sealed will system. The testator can create or modify the will anytime on the Internet. With the advantages of convenience, safety, and low cost of the design, this research is expected to encourage everyone to prepare a living will online, so as to shorten the time and process for the government and the family to arrange the inheritance of the deceased.

84888271725	Highly efficient authenticated key agreement in integrated 3G/WLAN IP networks	The integration of 3G cellular networks and WLANs into hybrid wireless IP network infrastructures features the combined advantages of 3G and WLAN technologies and has thus become well-accepted in the ever-expanding market in recent years. In addition to integrated services, efficient authentication and key distribution across heterogeneous access technologies are also keys to the success of the integration. However, currently the state-of-the-art protocols in this field either suffer from serious communication degradation due to latency or get misled by a non-practical trust relationship assumption among service providers, or both. To make a difference, in this paper, we propose a new scheme that is both efficient and practical. By sending authenticated commitments to the involved parties, the new scheme minimizes the number of exchanges between the home AAA server and the visited AAA server, and allows the visited AAA server to authenticate the mobile users on behalf of the home AAA server such that the overall performance can be dramatically improved. It not only eliminates the strong trust assumption but also provides verifiable information for accounting.

84888378406	Secure fast pre-authentication based on IEEE 802.11i	User mobility in WLANs becomes more and more popular because of the wide deployment of WLANs and numerous applications on it. Some of these applications, for example multimedia applications, require fast handoffs among access points to maintain the quality of service. In order to support multimedia applications for roaming users, IEEE 802.1 li defines pre-authentication to reduce the re-authentication delay. The primary drawback of IEEE 802.1 li pre-authentication is that the full 802.1 x/EAP authentication consumes too much overhead. In this paper, we propose two secure fast pre-authentication schemes that greatly improve the efficiency and achieve high security level.

84888403689	Non-linearity cannot help RFID resist full-disclosure attacks and terrorist fraud attacks	As the concept of radio-frequency identification (RFID) relay attack has been successfully implemented and demonstrated, the research of RFID distance-bounding protocols to deter RFID relay attacks has drawn much attention from both the industry and academia. Conventionally, researchers adopted linear composition of secrets to resist terrorist fraud attacks. Recently, Peris-Lopez et al. studied the weaknesses of previous RFID distance-bounding protocols and proposed that non-linear composition of secrets and inclusion of more random nonce could help RFID resist key disclosure attack and terrorist fraud attack. In this paper, we will show that non-linear composition of secrets cannot help enhance the security actually. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84893157594	Improved generalized ring signatures	Ring signature scheme allows a signer, ad hoc determining a group of users including himself, to sign signatures on behalf of the group such that verifiers will be convinced that the signature was really signed by the group, but cannot identify the actual signer. Such schemes facilitate important applications like leaking secret anonymously and deniable authentication. Ren and Harn further proposed a generalized multi-signer ring signature scheme that allows an actual signer (or a group of signers) to release some secret information later to convince any verifier that he/she is the actual signer. In this paper, we show that Ren-Harn's scheme is not secure: (1) In the multi-signer setting, any insider alone can masquerade as the specified group to sign any signature without cooperating with other group members; (2) Any non-signer ring member can make up bogus evidence to claim that he/she is the actual signer. Simple amendments are proposed to conquer the weaknesses while preserving the high computational efficiency. © 2014 ICIC International.

84905647967	Provably secure authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange for resource-limited smart card	Authenticated Diffie-Hellman key agreement is quite popular for establishing secure session keys. As resource-limited mobile devices are becoming more popular and security threats are increasing, it is desirable to reduce computational load for these resource-limited devices while still preserving its strong security and convenience for users. In this paper, we propose a new smart-card-based user authenticated key agreement scheme which allows users to memorize passwords, reduces users' device computational load while still preserves its strong security. The proposed scheme effectively improves the computational load of modular exponentiations by 50%, and the security is formally proved. © 2014 Shanghai Jiaotong University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84908635511	New Gen2v2-based mutual authentication schemes	Since EPCglobal announced Class 1 Generation 2 tag (Gen2) as the standard tag for supply chain management applications and Gen2 was ratified as an ISO 18000-6C standard, much effort has been devoted to promoting various Gen2-based applications and improving the security of Gen2. However, as many Gen2-based applications go beyond the original supply chain management and the security requirements of these applications could not be fulfilled without modifying the original Gen2 standards, EPC Global recently (2013/11) announced the revised Gen2 standard-called Gen2 version 2 (Gen2v2 for short), Gen2v2 includes several new security and file management features to fit various possible application requirements. Inspired by these new features, Engels et al. proposed two Gen2v2-based mutual authentication schemes. In this paper, we cryptanalyze the protocols, show the security weaknesses, and proposed our improvements.

84913546483	Efficient anonymous multi-receiver ID-based encryption with constant decryption cost	Anonymous multi-receiver identity (ID)-based encryption (anonymous MIBE) allows a sender to use the identities of multiple receivers to encrypt messages such that only the selected receivers can decrypt the messages while nobody, except the sender, knows who the other selected receivers are. Recently, several anonymous MIBE schemes were proposed. However, some security weaknesses were found in some of these schemes. Moreover, in the existing anonymous MIBE schemes, the decryption cost required for each receiver is linear in the number of selected receivers. In this article, we propose an efficient anonymous MIBE scheme and formally prove that it is semantically secure for both confidentiality and receiver anonymity. With compared to previously proposed anonymous MIBE schemes, our scheme has the best performance while offers provable security.

0742288853	Convertible Authenticated Encryption Scheme without Using Conventional One-Way Function	An authenticated encryption allows the designated recipient to verify the authenticity while recovering the message. To protect the recipient's benefit in case of a later dispute, a convertible authenticated encryption scheme allows the recipient to convert the authenticated encryption into an ordinary signature so that it becomes a publicly verifiable. This paper shows a universal forgery attack on Araki et al.'s convertible authenticated encryption scheme, and proposes a new convertible authenticated encryption scheme. Without using any conventional one-way function, the proposed scheme simplifies its security assumption on only a public hard problem - the discrete logarithm problem.

13844281059	Efficient time-bound hierarchical key assignment scheme	The access privileges in distributed systems can be effectively organized as a hierarchical tree that consists of distinct classes. A hierarchical time-bound key assignment scheme is to assign distinct cryptographic keys to distinct classes according to their privileges so that users from a higher class can use their class key to derive the keys of tower classes, and the keys are different for each time period; therefore, key derivation is constrained by both the class relation and the time period. This paper shall propose, based on a tamper-resistant device, a new time-bound key assignment scheme that greatly improves the computational performance and reduces the implementation cost.
