1842473601	3D DT-MRI Using a Reduced-FOV Approach and Saturation Pulses	Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can provide vital insights into brain connectivity, and may become an important tool for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disease. However, DTI's intrinsic low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and vulnerability to ghosting artifacts can result in poor image quality with low spatial resolution, which limits its clinical applications. In this study, a new double-shot EPI sequence (half-FOV EPI) with high spatial resolution was developed. This method enables DT measurements to be obtained with high isotropic spatial resolution and whole-brain coverage. To avoid ghosting artifacts, the data are combined in image space rather than in k-space. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

20344369065	Selective averaging for the diffusion tensor measurement	The multishot echo planar imaging sequence was often used in the high-resolution diffusion measurements. However, it is susceptible to motion artifacts because of the requirements of combining the raw data from different acquisitions into one complete k-space data set. Conventional solutions used cardiac gating but greatly extended the total acquisition time. Here we propose a selective averaging algorithm based on the information in the navigator echoes. The data were sampled continuously without cardiac gating. Contributions contaminated by motion were detected by a thresholding algorithm and were discarded during postprocessing. The data were then averaged in the modulus or complex format. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data with isotropic spatial resolution were acquired in phantom as well as from two normal volunteers. The information in the navigator echoes proved to be a good indicator for the extent of motion contamination. Differences were noticed between modulus and complex averaging in DTI quantification, but both showed reduced artifact and improved signal-to-noise ratio. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33646833575	The effects of single-trial averaging on the temporal resolution of functional MRI	Computer simulations and event-related functional MRI (ER-fMRI) experiments were performed to investigate the effects of single-trial averaging and the corresponding contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) on the minimal resolvable hemodynamic timing difference between brain areas. Three ER-fMRI sessions with temporally delayed (250, 500 and 1000 ms) visual stimulations between two hemifields, each with 70 repeated single trials, were examined on two subjects. From the computer simulation, the temporal resolution improved as the CNR increased, which reached 500 and 100 ms for CNRs of 1.55 and 6.44, respectively. In the ER-fMRI experiments, the measured CNR increased as more single trials were averaged. The detectability of temporal differences was positively correlated (P<.05) with the CNR in all sessions for one subject but only in the 1000-ms session for the other subject. Temporal resolution of 1000 ms was achieved when more than 10 trials were averaged. The 500- and 250-ms delays might be differentiable when more than 20 trials were averaged, but the results were subject-dependent. This study demonstrated that the CNR could be significantly improved by single-trial averaging, which led to an improved temporal resolution of ER-fMRI. Temporal resolution in the range of hundreds of milliseconds was subject-dependent, which might be attributed to the intrinsic spatial variations in the timing of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33745728318	Novel diffusion anisotropy indices: An evaluation	Purpose: To systematically evaluate diffusion anisotropy (DA) using newly defined Indices based on the diffusion deviation and mean diffusivity approach. Materials and Methods: Measures of amplitude, area, and volume of the DA index (DAI) were measured and compared with regard to their sensitivity to changes in DA, susceptibility to noise in the original diffusion-weighted (DW) images, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in homogenous regions. Simulations were performed under different levels of noise and DA. Human DTI data were acquired from eight normal volunteers. Results: Indices of area and volume measures provided improved resolution for characterizing the DA compared to the eigenvalue ratio. The amplitude measure showed consistent performances with good CNR and less susceptibility to noise in the original data. Conclusion: These indices are rotationally invariant without the requirement of eigenvalue sorting. At low anisotropy, all indices have a similar CNR. For larger DA, the first index (the deviation tensor divided by the DT) shows improved sensitivity, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and noise immunity compared to the other indices. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40949159717	Hemorrhage Detection During Focused-Ultrasound Induced Blood-Brain-Barrier Opening by Using Susceptibility-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging	High-intensity focused ultrasound has been discovered to be able to locally and reversibly increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which can be detected using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, side effects such as microhemorrhage, erythrocyte extravasations or even extensive hemorrhage may also occur. Although current contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI can be used to detect the changes in BBB permeability, its efficacy in detecting tissue hemorrhage after focused-ultrasound sonication remains limited. The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of magnetic resonance susceptibility-weighted imaging (MR-SWI) for identifying possible tissue hemorrhage associated with disruption of the BBB induced by focused ultrasound in a rat model. The brains of 42 Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 107 sonications, either unilaterally or bilaterally. Localized BBB opening was achieved by delivering burst-mode focused ultrasound energy into brain tissue in the presence of microbubbles. Rats were studied by T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI techniques, as well as by SWI. Tissue changes were analyzed histologically and the extent of apoptosis was investigated with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick-end labeling method. The results demonstrated that SWI is more sensitive than standard T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI techniques in detecting hemorrhages after brain sonication. Longitudinal study showed that SWI is sensitive to the recovery process of the damage and, therefore, could provide important and complementary information to the conventional MR images. Potential applications such as drug delivery in the brain might be benefited. (E-mail: jwang@mail.cgu.edu.tw). © 2008 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

58849087962	Correlation of apparent diffusion coefficients measured by 3T diffusion-weighted MRI and SUV from FDG PET/CT in primary cervical cancer	Purpose: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) are oncological feasible techniques. Currently, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measured by DWI and standard uptake value (SUV) from FDG PET/CT have similar applications in clinical oncology. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between ADC and SUV in primary cervical cancer. Materials and methods: Patients with documented primary cervical cancer were recruited.

77954111693	Microstructural changes in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy: A diffusion tensor imaging study	Purpose: To determine whether progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is associated with specific diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) patterns of diffusivity, anisotropy, and coherence in functionally relevant brain areas. Materials and Methods: In all, 17 PSP patients and 17 controls were scanned using a 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Patients were assessed in the off-medication condition using the Hoehn and Yahr staging and the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, motor subscale (UPDRS-III). Diffusion information were analyzed in relation to disease severity and subtypes. Results: Numerous changes in diffusion properties were identified in the subcortical areas. In the midbrain, fractional anisotropy (FA) decreased and MD (mean diffusivity) increased with disease progression. UPDRS-III scores correlated positively with both FA in the caudate and MD in the pons. DTI analysis of disease subtypes demonstrated significant differences between PSP-Parkinsonism and Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome in axial diffusivity values in the putamen and globus pallidus, as well as in intervoxel diffusion coherence values in themiddle cerebellar peduncle. Conclusion: Our findings, cautiously interpreted, demonstrate the advantage of using a functional imaging technique to aid in the specificity of defining more precisely the pathological processes taking place in white and gray matter regions in PSP. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

84867840476	Blind estimation of the arterial input function in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI using purity maximization	Uncertainty in arterial input function (AIF) estimation is one of the major errors in the quantification of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. A blind source separation algorithm was proposed to determine the AIF by selecting the voxel time course with maximum purity, which represents a minimal contamination from partial volume effects. Simulations were performed to assess the partial volume effect on the purity of AIF, the estimation accuracy of the AIF, and the influence of purity on the derived kinetic parameters. In vivo data were acquired from six patients with hypopharyngeal cancer and eight rats with brain tumor. Results showed that in simulation the AIF with the highest purity is closest to the true AIF. In patients, the manually selection had reduced purity, which could lead to underestimations of K

41849126402	Visualization of the coherence of the principal diffusion orientation: An eigenvector-based approach	A novel method for spatially mapping anisotropy/orientation coherence of the eigenvector is presented. By using an eigenvector-based approach, an intervoxel diffusion coherence (IVDC) index was used to quantify the coherence of the principal diffusion directions within a voxel neighborhood. This method may allow reconstruction of a whole brain map to be used for diagnostic purposes. The IVDC index is calculated by a scatter matrix-based method in a voxel-wise manner. A simulation was performed using two fiber populations crossing at various separation angles. We demonstrate that the IVDC index was more sensitive than fractional anisotropy (FA) to changes in separation between the fibers under a noise-free condition. Diffusion-tensor images of six healthy volunteers were acquired on a 3.0T MR imager. The FA, coherence index, and IVDC were then calculated. The results showed that IVDC improved the contrast in several brain areas including thalamus, middle cerebral peduncle, and pons. We therefore conclude that the IVDC index provides reliable and complementary information on water diffusion in the brain. It may be useful in white matter tractography, especially to determine the termination point of a trajectory. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

51449103596	Diffusion tensor imaging of the auditory pathway in sensorineural hearing loss: Changes in radial diffusivity and diffusion anisotropy	Purpose: To prospectively compare diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of axial diffusivity (λ∥), radial diffusivity (λ⊥), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) along the auditory pathway of patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and normal controls. Materials and Methods: In 37 individuals with SNHL and 10 healthy controls, two regions of interest (ROIs) positioned along the auditory pathway - the lateral lemniscus (LL) and the inferior collicums (IC) - were investigated bilaterally using diffusion tensor imaging at 3 T. SNHL patients were divided into three groups: patients with bilateral hearing loss, patients with unilateral hearing loss, and patients with partial hearing loss. DTI measures (λ∥, λ⊥, MD, FA) of both ROIs were determined in all subjects. Results: The FA value was reduced and the λ⊥ was increased both at the lateral lemniscus and the inferior colliculus of patients with SNHL compared with controls. Similar changes were seen between the ipsilateral and contralateral LL and IC for patients of unilateral profound hearing loss. No changes were observed in any other parameters. Conclusion: In SNHL patients DTI showed a high radial diffusivity that consequently led to a decreased fractional anisotropy in the LL and the IC. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

49749101646	Cortical control of gait in healthy humans: An fMRI study	This study examined the cortical control of gait in healthy humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two block-designed fMRI sessions were conducted during motor imagery of a locomotor-related task. Subjects watched a video clip that showed an actor standing and walking in an egocentric perspective. In a control session, additional fMRI images were collected when participants observed a video clip of the clutch movement of a right hand. In keeping with previous studies using SPECT and NIRS, we detected activation in many motor-related areas including supplementary motor area, bilateral precentral gyrus, left dorsal premotor cortex, and cingulate motor area. Smaller additional activations were observed in the bilateral precuneus, left thalamus, and part of right putamen. Based on these findings, we propose a novel paradigm to study the cortical control of gait in healthy humans using fMRI. Specifically, the task used in this study-involving both mirror neurons and mental imagery-provides a new feasible model to be used in functional neuroimaging studies in this area of research. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

50249166569	The cortical modulation from the external cues during gait observation and imagination	The cortical involvement of gait observation and imagination under the modulation of external cues was studied in human using fMRI. Fourteen healthy volunteers were scanned using visual stimuli, which showed an actor walking in different background. The defined relevant cue was a background of evenly spaced stripes orthogonal to the walking direction, which was rhythmic presented as the actor proceeded. The irrelevant cue was two parallel lines within which the actor was confined. When viewing the relevant cue, the subject showed activation, noticeably in dorsal premotor areas, posterior parietal lobes, bilateral parahippocampal lobes, and visual related areas. The relevant external cue leads to the modulation of cortical activation related to gait, which could initialize the processing of the input information and lead to a different motor strategy from the native automatic gait. The understanding of the cortical involvement of gait under different cues might lead to a new clinical impact on the therapeutic intervention of patients with Parkinson's disease. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

52649108714	Reduced encoding diffusion spectrum imaging implemented with a bi-Gaussian model	Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) can map complex fiber microstructures in tissues by characterizing their 3-D water diffusion spectra. However, a long acquisition time is required for adequate q-space sampling to completely reconstruct the 3-D diffusion probability density function. Furthermore, to achieve a high q-value encoding for sufficient spatial resolution, the diffusion gradient duration and the diffusion time are usually lengthened on a clinical scanner, resulting in a long echo time and low signal-to-noise ratio of diffusion-weighted images. To bypass long acquisition times and strict gradient requirements, the reduced-encoding DSI (RE-DSI) with a bi-Gaussian diffusion model is presented in this study. The bi-Gaussian extrapolation kernel, based on the assumption of the bi-Gaussian diffusion signal curve across biological tissue, is applied to the reduced q-space sampling data in order to fulfill the high q-value requirement. The crossing phantom model and the manganese-enhanced rat model served as standards for accuracy assessment in RE-DSI. The errors of RE-DSI in estimating fiber orientations were close to the noise limit. Meanwhile, evidence from a human study demonstrated that RE-DSI significantly decreased the acquisition time required to resolve complex fiber orientations. The presented method facilitates the application of DSI analysis on a clinical magnetic resonance imaging system. © IEEE.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate this variability using a visual task and a word generation task. Patients, material, and methods: Five Chinese right-handed male volunteers participated in the experiment. Experiments were conducted using a 1.5 T clinical MRI scanner with a T2*-weighted single-shot gradient-echo EPI sequence. Each task contained 150 trials that were separated into 5 runs. For each voxel, time courses averaged across different numbers of randomly selected trials, were obtained. They were applied for determining the voxels with significant activations, using a students' t-test (p<0.001, uncorrected). Results: Consistent with previous findings, the number of the activated voxels increased monotonically with the number of trials combined. The ascending rate and the maximum number of the activated voxels were different, however, between tasks and among subjects. Conclusions: The effects of single-trial averaging were found to vary significantly between tasks and subjects. Therefore, we strongly advise to carefully consider such variability when using the spatial extent of activation as a measure in a group or a task comparison. © 2006 Biomedical Imaging and Intervention Journal.

56749178406	Anterior cranial fossa hemorrhagic epidermoid cyst: CT and MRI findings	We reported a rare case of hemorrhagic epidermoid cyst located in the anterior cranial fossa. A 66-year-old female presented with progressive nausea and vomiting for one month. Computed tomography revealed a mixed high and low density mass in the right lateral frontal basal region, with a few stippled calcifications at its inferior wall. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the lesion was largely hyperintense on T1 weighted images and was of heterogeneously mixed high and low signal intensity on T2 weighted images. The lesion had a surrounding dark rim and exhibited curvilinear contrast enhancement in its medial margin. The patient underwent total surgical removal of the mass and did well during one year follow-up. Recognition of imaging findings facilitates appropriate preoperative differential diagnosis and is helpful to prevent leakage of cystic content during surgery.

57049099839	Measurement of diffusion fractional anisotropy with T2 contrast to reduce noise	The purpose is to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in fractional anisotropy of the diffusion tensor without the acquisition of the low-diffusion-weighted image. The fractional anisotropy (FA) was reconstructed from the six diffusion-weighted images, instead of the diffusion tensor elements. The contribution of the spin-spin relaxation and proton density was estimated and could be excluded. A linear relationship of signal attenuation from the diffusion process was further assumed. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using a data-set of 30 diffusion anisotropy levels and 100 proton density levels. Gaussian-distributed noises of 20 levels were added. Human images were acquired from 6 subjects. The original FA and the proposed indices were calculated. Our results show that the new indices increased linearly with the diffusion anisotropy. The indices had a comparable contrast with the original FA, but with improved noise level and reduced acquisition time. The FA map can be calculated without the estimation of the contribution from spin-spin relaxation and the proton density. The index can be calculated under the assumption of linear signal attenuation. The minimum number diffusion-weighted images for measuring FA is six, instead of seven.

57649231163	Determination of fiber orientation in MRI diffusion tensor imaging based on higher-order tensor decomposition	High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) techniques have been used for resolving multiple fiber directions within a voxel. Using HARDI, a high-order tensor can be obtained through generalized diffusion tensor imaging (GDTI). In this paper, based on the decomposition of the high-order diffusion tensors, a mathematical technique is presented which permits accurate resolution of multiple, randomly-oriented fiber tracts within tissue. A sequence of pseudo-eigenvalues and pseudo-eigenvectors are derived from the diffusion tensor through successive application of a best least-square rank-1 tensor approximation. These pseudoeigenvalues and pseudo-eigenvectors are used to identify the major fiber directions within an individual image voxel. Results of a numerical simulation are presented to demonstrate the technique. © 2007 IEEE.

Materials and Methods: Focused ultrasound (frequency: 1.5 MHz) was used to induce disruption of the BBB in 39 rats. Two T2*-weighted images were obtained before and after SPIO administration. Preenhanced T2*-weighted images were used to detect hemorrhage. Detection of BBB disruption was performed on SPIO-enhanced images. Thirty-four rats were sacrificed after magnetic resonance (MR) scanning for histological confirmation of brain lesions. Theremaining five animals were followed up for 35 days. Prussian blue staining was performed on histological sections to detect SPIO particles in the brain. Results: After SPIO injection the areas of BBB disruption in rat brain were significantly enlarged. The area of mismatch between the T2*-weighted images indicated a safe region where BBB opening occurred without hemorrhagic complications. In the longitudinal study, removal of SPIO occurred at a faster rate in hemorrhagic areas, albeit being closer to that occurring in the liver. The presence of SPIO was confirmed by Prussian blue staining in brain parenchyma and capillary endothelial cells in areas of BBB disruption. Conclusion: T2*-weighted images-either with and without SPIO enhancement-may differentiate focused ultrasound-induced BBB disruption from brain hemorrhage. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

61649128591	An Integrated Diffusion Map for the Analysis of Diffusion Properties. A Feasibility Study in Patients with Acoustic Neuroma	Rationale and Objectives: To develop an integrated diffusion map (iDM) for evaluation of diffusion properties, including the mean diffusivity and diffusion anisotropy concurrently. Materials and Methods: The proposed integrated diffusion map consisted of trace and the deviation tensor. It measures the diffusion distributions from a region of interest. Diffusion tensor imaging was acquired from nine healthy volunteers and four patients with acoustic neuroma before and 3 months after the stereotactic radiosurgery. Five regions of interest were selected from healthy subjects and the whole tumor from the patients. The diffusion properties were analyzed in the proposed integrated diffusion map. Results: In healthy subjects, iDM showed different distributions in regions of interest that can lead to cluster segmentation. In monitoring the treatment response, the number of pixels with meaningful changes in iDM is 12.5% compared to 32.37% in apparent diffusion coefficient and 16.67% in fractional anisotropy. It suggested the effect from radiation therapy might affect the anisotropic diffusion. The interpretation of the diffusion properties, such as changes in mean diffusivity and anisotropy, should be treated in an integrated method. Conclusions: The integrated diffusion map can be used to analyze the diffusion properties in a comprehensive manner. © 2009 AUR.

Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. From May 2006 to October 2007, 48 consecutive patients aged 25-80 years (mean age, 57 years) who had endometrial cancer were prospectively enrolled for preoperative evaluation by using a 3-T MR unit. Two radiologists interpreted the depth of myometrial invasion on T2-weighted images, dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR images, and fused T2-weighted and DW MR images (b = 1000 sec/mm2). Statistical methods included k statistics for reader agreement, Pearson analysis for pathologic correlation, accuracy assessment, and receiver operating characteristic analysis for diagnostic performance comparison. Surgical pathologic findings were the reference standard. Results: Reader agreement was excellent for fused T2-weighted and DW images (weighted k, 0.79), with a significant pathologic correlation regarding the depth of myometrial invasion (r = 0.94, P < .0001). For assessing any myometrial involvement, addition of fused T2-weighted and DW imaging to dynamic contrast-enhanced or dynamic contrast-enhanced and T2-weighted imaging was significantly better compared with dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging alone (P < .001) or dynamic contrast-enhanced and T2- weighted (P = .001) imaging; T2-weighted imaging combined with fused T2-weighted and DW imaging also was better than dynamic contrast-enhanced and T2-weighted imaging (P = .001).

63549100950	The effect of continuous theta burst stimulation over premotor cortex on circuits in primary motor cortex and spinal cord	Objective: To understand the effect of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) given to the premotor area, we studied the circuits within the primary motor cortex and spinal cord after cTBS over the dorsal premotor area (PMd). Methods: Three sets of parameters, including corticospinal excitability, short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) and forearm reciprocal inhibition (RI) were tested. Results: Paralleling the effects of cTBS applied directly to the primary motor cortex, cTBS over the left PMd suppressed corticospinal excitability as measured by the change in the size of MEPs evoked by single pulse TMS over primary motor cortex. Premotor cTBS appeared to have a longer lasting, but no more powerful effect on corticospinal excitability than motor cTBS, however, unlike motor cTBS it had no effect on SICI or ICF. Finally, although premotor cTBS had no effect on spinal H-reflexes, it did reduce the third phase of RI between forearm extensor and flexor muscles. Conclusions: Premotor cTBS is a quick and useful way of modulating excitability in cortical and possibly subcortical motor circuits. Significance: Premotor cTBS can be used as an alternative to regular rTMS to evaluate cortical function, motor behaviours and the response to disease therapy. © 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

66749132791	Potential in reducing scan times of HARDI by accurate correction of the cross-term in a hemispherical encoding scheme	Purpose: To reduce the scan time of high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) by using the hemispherical encoding scheme with the cross-term correction. Materials and Methods: Unidirectional and 45° crossing phantoms were built to evaluate the accuracy of the fiber orientation estimation when using a hemispherical encoding scheme with and without the cross-term correction. The q-ball imaging using the spherical harmonic basis was adopted for estimation of fiber orientation. By recalculating the diffusion gradient strengths, we make the actual b value in all directions equal to the expected b value for the correction of the cross-term. Results: The separation angles measured on the crossing phantom are 42.67° ± 1.50°, 42.75° ± 2.10°, and 42.93° ± 2.78° for cross-term-free results, for the results from the hemispherical encoding scheme with and without the cross-term correction. The angular errors in mapping the unidirectional phantom are 1.87°-2.29° and 4.01°-4.92° for the results using the hemispherical encoding scheme with and without correcting for the cross-term at different b values. Conclusion: Using the hemispherical encoding scheme with the cross-term correction can potentially halve the scan time of HARDI and obtain accurate fiber orientation estimation simultaneously. This will be helpful in the clinical application of HARDI. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

69549107493	Functional MRI in the assessment of cortical activation during gait-related imaginary tasks	Imaginary tasks can be used to investigate the neurophysiology of gait. In this study, we explored the cortical control of gait-related imagery in 21 healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Imaginary tasks included gait initiation, stepping over an obstacle, and gait termination. Subjects watched a video clip that showed an actor in gait motion under an event-related design. We detected activation in the supplementary motor area during major gait-related imagery tasks, and especially during gait initiation. During gait termination and stepping over an obstacle, the amount of cortical resources allocated to the imaginary tasks included a large visuomotor network comprising the dorsal and ventral premotor areas. We conclude that our paradigm to study the cortical control of gait may help in elucidating the pathophysiology of higher-level gait disorders. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

72149127882	The characteristics, biodistribution, magnetic resonance imaging and biodegradability of superparamagnetic core-shell nanoparticles	An efficient contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential to enhance the detection and characterization of lesions within the body. In this study, we described the development of biodegradable nanoparticles with a core-shell structure to formulate superparamagnetic iron oxide (CSNP-SPIO) for MRI. The developed nanoparticles were composed of a hydrophobic PLGA core and a positively-charged glycol chitosan shell. The results obtained by transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction measurement confirmed that the prepared nanoparticles had a core-shell structure with SPIO in their core area. No aggregation of nanoparticles was observed during storage in water, as a result of the electrostatic repulsion between the positively-charged nanoparticles. The magnetic properties of nanoparticles were examined by a vibrating sample magnetometer and a superconducting quantum interference device; the results showed that the superparamagnetism of SPIO was preserved after the CSNP-SPIO formulation. In tracking their cellular internalization pathway, we found that CSNP-SPIO accumulated in lysosomes.

Eighteen (12%) patients were diagnosed as having distant malignancies (15 patients had distant metastases, and three distant synchronous tumours). On a patient-based analysis, WB-MRI and FDG-PET-CT showed similar sensitivity (77.8% vs 72.2%, P>0.999), specificity (98.5% vs 97.7%, P>0.999) and diagnostic capability (0.905 vs 0.878, P=0.669). Combined interpretation of WB-MRI and FDG-PET-CT showed no significant benefit over either technique alone. In conclusion, 3.0-Tesla WB-MRI is a feasible, non-ionising technique that showed similar diagnostic capacity to FDG-PET-CT in assessing distant-site status in patients with untreated NPC and can be recommended as the first-line imaging technique for comprehensive evaluation of such patients. © 2009 European Society of Radiology.

73149123165	Accelerating SENSE using compressed sensing	Both parallel MRI and compressed sensing (CS) are emerging techniques to accelerate conventional MRI by reducing the number of acquired data. The combination of parallel MRI and CS for further acceleration is of great interest. In this paper, we propose a novel method to combine sensitivity encoding (SENSE), one of the standard methods for parallel MRI, and compressed sensing for rapid MR imaging (SparseMRI), a recently proposed method for applying CS in MR imaging with Cartesian trajectories. The proposed method, named CS-SENSE, sequentially reconstructs a set of aliased reduced-field-of-view images in each channel using SparseMRI and then reconstructs the final image from the aliased images using Cartesian SENSE. The results from simulations and phantom and in vivo experiments demonstrate that CS-SENSE can achieve a reduction factor higher than those achieved by SparseMRI and SENSE individually and outperform the existing method that combines parallel MRI and CS. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In this study, we sought to investigate the feasibility of labeling cells with superparamagnetic iron oxide particles to assess the inflammatory response during focused-ultrasound-induced BBB opening. We show that infiltration of phagocytes does not occur using optimal parameters of sonication. Taken together, the results of our study support the usefulness and safety of focused-ultrasound-induced BBB opening for enhancing drug delivery to the brain. These findings may have implications for the optimization of sonication parameters. © 2010 ISCBFM All rights reserved.

76349124080	Combination of multiple features in support vector machine with principal component analysis in application for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressively neuro-degenerative disorder characterized by symptoms such as memory loss and cognitive degeneration. In the AD-related research, the volumetric analysis of hippocampus is the most extensive study. However, the segmentation and identification of the hippocampus are highly complicated and time-consuming. Therefore, we designed a MRI-based classification framework to distinguish AD's patients from normal individuals. First, volumetric features and shape features were extracted from MRI data. Afterward, Principle component analysis (PCA) was utilized to decrease the dimensions of feature space. Finally, a SVM classifier was trained for AD classification. With the proposed framework, the classification accuracy is improved from 73.08% or 76.92%, by only using volumetric features or shape features, to 92.31% by using three kinds of volume features and two kinds of shape features. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

76749152940	Significant temporal evolution of diffusion anisotropy for evaluating early response to radiosurgery in patients with vestibular schwannoma: Findings from functional diffusion maps	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Outcome evaluation in clinical oncology is conventionally based on long-term volumetric changes in the tumor size. The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate the usefulness of fDMs in incorporating anisotropic diffusion in the evaluation of early response after radiosurgery in patients with vestibular schwannoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MD, FA, and IVDC were calculated by using simple averaging methods and fDMs. Six patients with vestibular schwannoma treated with stereotactic radiosurgery underwent longitudinal DTI studies on a 3T MR imaging scanner (maximum follow-up, 6 months). Posttreatment DTI data were spatially coregistered with pretreatment scans. RESULTS: Tumors did not change significantly in size until 6 months after treatment. Diffusion indices changed significantly during the study period. There was a transient decrease in averaged MD followed by a significant increase. IVDC showed an opposite behavior compared with MD. FA decreased continuously throughout the study period. Functional diffusion maps showed a heterogeneous response of tumors to treatment, thereby providing complementary information to simple averaged values. CONCLUSIONS: DTI allows early detection of therapeutic-induced changes in patients with vestibular schwannoma. Functional diffusion maps incorporating anisotropic diffusion may aid in assessing the heterogeneity of the therapeutic response in this patient group.

77649334400	Longitudinal study of carbon monoxide intoxication by diffusion tensor imaging with neuropsychiatric correlation	Background: White matter damage is common after carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication, but in vivo follow-up studies about the mechanism of white matter damage are not possible in pathology series. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) can quantify diffusion parameters and volumetric changes in white matter that can be correlated with neuropsychological performances in longitudinal studies. Methods: We examined 9 patients with CO intoxication using DTI, VBM and neuropsychologic tests at an average of 3 and 10 months after CO exposure. We used data from 18 age- and sex-matched controls for comparison. Results: We found that cognitive recovery at 10 months after CO intoxication was not significant, although it was after 3 months. The neuropsychologic tests correlated better for the fibre tract of the semicentrum ovale and not the periventricular fibres. Diffusion measures suggest increases in fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and axial eigenvalues over time, while increases in radial eigenvalue were evident at 3 months compared with controls. Periventricular white matter atrophy was observed 10 months after CO intoxication. Limitations: Our study included few cases, and the interpretation of the putative changes on neuroimaging findings cannot be confirmed by histology. Conclusion: Our study showed that the evolution of white matter injury in CO encephalopathy occurred over time. Cognitive recovery was not evident in the follow-up period because of white matter injuries. © 2010 Canadian Medical Association.

77949891086	Focused ultrasound induced blood-brain barrier disruption to enhance chemotherapeutic drugs (BCNU) delivery for glioblastoma treatment	Focused ultrasound has been recently found to capable of temporally and reversibly disrupt local blood-brain barrier (BBB) and opens new frontier in delivering varies type of drugs into brain for central nerve system (CNS) disorder treatment. In this study, we aim to investigate the feasibility of delivering 1, 3-bits (2-chloroethyl) -1-nitrosourea (BCNU) to treat glioblastoma in animal models and evaluate whether this approach would gain treatment efficacy. Under the presence of microbubbles administration, a 400-kHz focused ultrasound was employed to deliver burst-tone ultrasonic energy stimulation to disrupt BBB in animal brains transcranially, and in-vivo monitored by magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI). C6-glioma cells were cultured and implanted into Sprague-Dawley rats as the brain-tumor model. BCNU deposited in brain was quantified by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and brain tissues were examined histologically. MRI was employed to longitudinal evaluate the brain tumor treatment including the analysis of tumor progression and animal survival. We confirmed that the focused ultrasound, under the secure ultrasonic energy level, can significantly enhance the BCNU penetration through BBB over 300% than control without cause hemorrhage. Apparent improvement of treatment efficacy achieved by combining focused ultrasound with BCNU delivery, including significant suppression of tumor growth and a prolonged animal survival. This study highly support that this treatment strategy could be clinically-relevant and may help to provide another potential strategy in increasing local chemotherapeutic drugs for brain-tumor treatment. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

77951477367	Blood-brain barrier disruption with focused ultrasound enhances delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs for glioblastoma treatment	Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of using focused ultrasound to enhance delivery of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) to glioblastomas in rats with induced tumors and determine if such an approach increases treatment efficacy. Materials and Methods: All animal experiments were approved by the animal committee and adhered to the experimental animal care guidelines. A 400-kHz focused ultrasound generator was used to transcranially disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in rat brains by delivering burst-tone ultrasound energy in the presence of microbubbles. The process was monitored in vivo by using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Cultured C6 glioma cells implanted in Sprague-Dawley rats were used as the tumor model. BCNU (13.5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously and its concentration in brains was quantified by using high-performance liquid chromatography. MR imaging was used to evaluate the effect of treatments longitudinally, including analysis of tumor progression and animal survival, and brain tissues were histologically examined. Methods including the two-tailed unpaired t test and the Mantel-Cox test were used for statistical analyses, with a significance level of.05. Results: Focused ultrasound significantly enhanced the penetration of BCNU through the BBB in normal (by 340%) and tumor-implanted (by 202%) brains without causing hemorrhaging. Treatment of tumor-implanted rats with focused ultrasound alone had no beneficial effect on tumor progression or on animal survival up to 60 days. Administration of BCNU only transiently controlled tumor progression; nevertheless, relative to untreated controls, animal survival was improved by treatment with BCNU alone (increase in median survival time [IST

77951857856	Restoration of motor inhibition through an abnormal premotor-motor connection in dystonia	To clarify the rationale for using rTMS of dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) to treat dystonia, we examined how the motor system reacts to an inhibitory form of rTMS applied to the PMd in healthy subjects and in a group of patients with focal hand dystonia and DYT1 gene carriers. Continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) with 300 and 600 pulses (cTBS300 and cTBS600) was applied to PMd, and its after-effects were quantified by measuring the amplitude of MEPs evoked by single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex (M1), short interval intracortical inhibition/facilitation (SICI/ICF) within M1, the third phase of spinal reciprocal inhibition (RI), and writing tests. In addition, in DYT1 gene carriers, the effects of cTBS300 over M1 and PMd on MEPs were studied in separate experiments. In healthy subjects, cTBS300 and cTBS600 over PMd suppressed MEPs for 30 min or more and cTBS600 decreased SICI and RI. In contrast, neither form of cTBS over PMd had any significant effect on MEPs, while cTBS600 increased effectiveness of SICI and RI and improved writing in patients with writer's cramp. NMDYT1 had a normal response to cTBS300 over left PMd. We suggest that the reduced PMd to M1 interaction in dystonic patients is likely to be due to reduced excitability of PMd-M1 connections. The possible therapeutic effects of premotor rTMS may therefore involve indirect effects of PMd on SICI and RI, which this study has shown can be normalised by cTBS. © 2010 Movement Disorder Society.

77955538083	Magnetic resonance imaging of transplanted mouse islets labeled with chitosan-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles	Although only 10% of islet recipients maintain insulin independence, 80% of them are C-peptide positive at 5 years after transplantation. To better understand the fate of transplanted islets, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique has been used to detect Feridex-labeled islet grafts in rodents. In this study, we used a novel MRI contrast agent, chitosan-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide (CSPIO) nanoparticles, to monitor mouse islet grafts. Male inbred C57BL/6 mice were used as donors and recipients of islet transplantation. The islet cytotoxicity was evaluated by fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide staining for RAW cells incubated with CSPIO. After being incubated overnight with and without CSPIO (10 mg/mL), 300 islets were transplanted under the left kidney capsule of each mouse. After transplantation, 3.0-Tesla MRI of the recipients was performed biweekly until 19 weeks. At the end of study, the islet graft was removed for insulin and Prussian blue staining. The cell death rates in RAW cells did not increase with increasing CSPIO concentrations or incubation time. The grafts of CSPIO-labeled islets were visualized on MRI scans as distinct hypointense spots homogeneously located at the upper pole of left kidney. Their MRI signal was 30%50% that of control islets and was maintained throughout the follow-up period. At 18 weeks, the histology of CSPIO-labeled islet graft revealed the insulin- and iron-stained areas to be almost identical. Our results indicate that isolated mouse islets labeled with CSPIO nanoparticles can be effectively and safely imaged by using MRI as long as 18 weeks after transplantation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77956471294	Activation of the auditory cortex in subjects with unilateral sensorineural hearing impairment in response to hearing their own names	This study investigated the differences in activation of the auditory cortex between subjects with right and left unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) when hearing their own names spoken by an unknown voice. All experiments were performed in the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging was acquired using a 3-Tesla Siemens scanner. Ten subjects with unilateral SNHL were recruited (3 male and 7 female, aged 30 ± 14.9 years, with 14 ± 6.29 hearing-impaired years). The activation pattern in the contralateral auditory cortex was wider than in the ipsilateral auditory cortex for all unilateral SNHL subjects. The auditory cortex of subjects with left SNHL hearing their own names spoken by an unknown voice was more active than it was in subjects with right SNHL. Despite this difference, however, subjects with unilateral SNHL in different ears were still generally treated with the same management strategies. The activation of the subjects' auditory cortex in response to hearing their own names spoken by an unknown voice was different between the two groups. Therefore, it indicates that the ability of residual hearing of subjects to recognize their own name spoken by an unknown voice varies depending on the side of their SNHL.

77957013817	Magnetic resonance monitoring of focused ultrasound/magnetic nanoparticle targeting delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain	The superparamagnetic properties of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) allow them to be guided by an externally positioned magnet and also provide contrast for MRI. However, their therapeutic use in treating CNS pathologies in vivo is limited by insufficient local accumulation and retention resulting from their inability to traverse biological barriers. The combined use of focused ultrasound and magnetic targeting synergistically delivers therapeutic MNPs across the blood-brain barrier to enter the brain both passively and actively. Therapeutic MNPs were characterized and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo, and MRI was used to monitor and quantify their distribution in vivo. The technique could be used in normal brains or in those with tumors, and significantly increased the deposition of therapeutic MNPs in brains with intact or compromised blood-brain barriers. Synergistic targeting and image monitoring are powerful techniques for the delivery of macromolecular chemotherapeutic agents into the CNS under the guidance of MRI.

78249241188	Self-assembled pH-sensitive nanoparticles: A platform for oral delivery of protein drugs	The oral route is considered to be the most convenient and comfortable means of drug administration for patients. Nevertheless, oral administration of hydrophilic macromolecules such as peptide/protein drugs is encountered with many difficulties. To overcome these difficulties, a pH-sensitive nanoparticle (NP) carrier system, self-assembled by chitosan (CS) and poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), is developed for paracellular transports of insulin. Oral administration of insulin-loaded NPs shows a significant hypoglycemic action in diabetic rats and the corresponding relative bioavailability of insulin is approximately 15%. These findings suggest that the developed NP system is a promising carrier for improved transmucosal delivery of insulin in the small intestine. Besides insulin, this NP carrier system is expected to serve as a platform for oral delivery of hydrophilic macromolecules such as pharmaceutically active peptides/proteins, glycosaminoglycans, and oligonucleotides. Studies on the detailed mechanism of tight-junction opening by CS or its derivatives are in progress, which is of paramount importance and needs to be established to aid further development in the use of NPs for oral delivery of hydrophilic macromolecules. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

78449242559	Novel magnetic/ultrasound focusing system enhances nanoparticle drug delivery for glioma treatment	Malignant glioma is a common and severe primary brain tumor with a high recurrence rate and an extremely high mortality rate within 2 years of diagnosis, even when surgical, radiological, and chemotherapeutic interventions are applied. Intravenously administered drugs have limited use because of their adverse systemic effects and poor blood-brain barrier penetration. Here, we combine 2 methods to increase drug delivery to brain tumors. Focused ultrasound transiently permeabilizes the blood-brain barrier, increasing passive diffusion. Subsequent application of an external magnetic field then actively enhances localization of a chemotherapeutic agent immobilized on a novel magnetic nanoparticle. Combining these techniques significantly improved the delivery of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1- nitrosourea to rodent gliomas. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles allowed their delivery to be monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The resulting suppression of tumor progression without damaging the normal regions of the brain was verified by MRI and histological examination. This noninvasive, reversible technique promises to provide a more effective and tolerable means of tumor treatment, with lower therapeutic doses and concurrent clinical monitoring. © The Author(s) 2010.

78650432376	Magnetic resonance imaging study of mouse islet allotransplantation	Although only 10% of islet transplant recipients maintain insulin independence, 80% of them are C-peptide positive at 5 years. To better understand the fate of transplanted islets, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique has been used to detect superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)labeled transplanted islets. Recently, we successfully used a novel MRI contrast agent, chitosan-coated SPIO (CSPIO) nanoparticles, to monitor mouse islet isografts for 18 weeks after transplantation. In the present study, we tested whether CSPIO could be applied to monitor islet allografts, which are supposedly rejected without immune interventions. Male C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice were used as donors and recipients of islet transplantation, respectively. After overnight incubation with or without CSPIO (10 μg/mL), 300 C57BL/6 islets were transplanted under the left kidney capsule of each Balb/c mouse. Starting from day 10 after transplantation, 3.0-Tesla MRI of the recipients was performed weekly. Four mice were followed for <38 days. At 38 and 45 days, 1 islet graft was removed for insulin and Prussian blue staining, respectively. From days 10 to 45 after transplantation, CSPIO-labeled islet grafts were visualized on MRI scans as sustained distinct hypointense spots homogeneously located at the upper pole of left kidney, the site of transplantation. At days 38 and 45, the histology of CSPIO-labeled islet grafts revealed insulin and iron staining colocalized in the same areas. Our results in a mouse allotransplantation model indicated that CSPIO-labeled islets survived as long as 45 days with positive MRI. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

MCI has a high risk to convert into Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the related research, the volumetric analysis of hippocampus is the most extensive study. However, the segmentation and identification of the hippocampus are highly complicated and time-consuming. Therefore, we designed a MRI-based classification framework to distinguish the patients of MCI and AD from normal individuals. First, volumetric features and shape features were extracted from MRI data. Afterward, Principle component analysis (PCA) was utilized to decrease the dimensions of feature space. Finally, a Self-organizing map classifier was trained for patient classification. By combining the volumetric features and shape features, the classification accuracy is reached to 86.76%, 66.67%, and 46.67% in AD, amnestic MCI (aMCI), and dysexecutive MCI (dMCI), respectively. In addition, with the help of PCA process, the classification result is improved to 93.63%, 73.33%, and 53.33% in AD, aMCI and dMCI, respectively. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79956150536	Characterization of quaternized chitosan-stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles as a novel potential magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent for cell tracking	Polymer-stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles could be used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to their unique superparamagnetism. Here we demonstrate a quaternized chitosan, i.e. N-[(2-hydroxy-3-trimethylammonium)propyl] chitosan chloride (HTCC), encapsulating superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), with very low toxicity and less effect on cell growth. HTCC has quaternary amino groups introduced into the chitosan chain, and such modification of chitosan should render it soluble in water. Most importantly, the HTCC-SPIO thus prepared has the ability to accelerate the MRI relaxation processes of surrounding water protons, resulting in enhanced MRI contrast (R2: y = 0.1076x - 0.0092; R1: y = 0.008x - 0.0005). The iron content quantified by Prussian blue staining and MRI revealed a positive correlation between Prussian blue positive cells and the change of MRI signal intensity. Also, transmission electron microscopy and element mapping confirmed intracellular metal-like spots as internalized iron oxide. Such findings support the use of these quaternized chitosan-stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles as a potential MRI contrast agent for cell tracking. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.

79957881448	Enhancement of cell retention and functional benefits in myocardial infarction using human amniotic-fluid stem-cell bodies enriched with endogenous ECM	Stem cell transplantation may repair the infarcted heart. Despite the encouraging preliminary results, an optimal cell type used and low retention of the transplanted cells remain to be overcome. In this study, a multiwelled methylcellulose hydrogel system was used to cultivate human amniotic-fluid stem cells (hAFSCs) to form spherically symmetric cell bodies for cellular cardiomyoplasty. The grown hAFSC bodies enriched with extracellular matrices (ECM) were xenogenically transplanted in the peri-infarct area of an immune-suppressed rat, via direct intramyocardial injection. Results of bioluminescence imaging and real-time PCR revealed that hAFSC bodies could considerably enhance cell retention and engraftment in short-term and long-term observations, when compared with dissociated hAFSCs. Echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging showed that the enhanced cell engraftment in the hAFSC-body group could significantly attenuate the progression of heart failure, improve the global function, and increase the regional wall motion. At the infarct, expressions of HGF, bFGF and VEGF were significantly up-regulated, an indication of the significantly increased vessel densities in the hearts treated with hAFSC bodies. The injected hAFSC bodies could undergo differentiation into angiogenic and cardiomyogenic lineages and contribute to functional benefits by direct regeneration. The aforementioned results demonstrate that hAFSC bodies can attenuate cell loss after intramuscular injection by providing an adequate physical size and offering an enriched ECM environment to retain the transplanted cells in the myocardium, thus improving heart function. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79961010350	Measuring Anisotropic Diffusion in Kidney Using MRI	Rationale and Objectives: To measure the anisotropic diffusion in kidney and to demonstrate the feasibility of renal tractography. Materials and Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging was acquired in kidney from 10 healthy volunteers and 5 patients with chronic kidney disease. Diffusion indices were calculated from the tensor, including fractional anisotropy, intervoxel diffusion coherence, and mean/axial/radial diffusivity. Results: Acquisitions with respiratory triggering could provide improved image quality in all diffusion indices, as compared to that by breathhold. It is sufficient to use five to seven scan averages when the measured diffusion indices converge to a steady state in medulla, which reduced the acquisition time in a triggered measurement down to a clinically tolerable limit. Second, the measured diffusion indices can be affected by the diffusion weighting. An increased diffusion weighting will lead to an underestimation in all diffusion indices. Finally the direction of water diffusion is consistent in the kidney cortex, which was properly reflected in intervoxel diffusion coherence. In a feasibility study in healthy volunteers and patients, renal tractography was performed that visualized the organized renal structure and as it declined with the progress of chronic kidney disease. Conclusion: When compared to conventional breath hold technique, the significant improvement in image quality compensated for the prolonged acquisition time. Therefore, triggered acquisition is preferred in a clinical setting because it required less from patient cooperation. © 2011 AUR.

80053081988	Parkinson disease: Diagnostic utility of diffusion kurtosis imaging	Purpose: To examine the usefulness of diffusion kurtosis imaging for the diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD). Materials and Methods: Examinations were performed with the understanding and written consent of each subject, with local ethics committee approval, and in compliance with national legislation and Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 30 patients with idiopathic PD (mean age, 64.5 years ± 3.4 [standard deviation]) and 30 healthy subjects (mean age, 65.0 years ± 5.1). Mean kurtosis, fractional anisotropy, and mean, axial, and radial diffusivity of the basal ganglia were compared between the groups. Disease severity was assessed by using Hoehn and Yahr staging and the motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (mean scores, 2.0 and 33.6, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the diagnostic accuracies of the indexes of interest. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to correlate imaging findings with disease severity. Results: Mean kurtosis in the putamen was higher in the PD group (0.93 ± 0.15) than in the control group (0.71 ± 0.09) (P < .000416). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.95 for both the ipsilateral putamen and the ipsilateral substantia nigra. The mean kurtosis for the ipsilateral substantia nigra had the best diagnostic performance (mean cutoff, 1.10; sensitivity, 0.92; specificity, 0.87). In contrast, AUCs for the tensor-derived indexes ranged between 0.43 (axial and radial diffusivity in substantia nigra) and 0.65 (fractional anisotropy in substantia nigra). Conclusion: Diffusion kurtosis imaging in the basal ganglia, as compared with conventional diffusion-tensor imaging, can improve the diagnosis of PD. © RSNA, 2011.

83755220630	Clinical significance of the pallidoreticular pathway in patients with carbon monoxide intoxication	Whereas globus pallidus lesions resulting from carbon monoxide intoxication have been extensively described in the literature, the clinical significance of pallidoreticular lesions has rarely been mentioned. This study incorporated information from functional and structural imaging to explore the correlations of pallidoreticular lesions with parkinsonian features and neurobehavioural performance. Twenty-five patients (11 males) with globus pallidus lesions after carbon monoxide intoxication and 25 age-and sex-matched controls were enrolled for detailed neurological examinations, cognitive testing, susceptibility weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging and 99mTc-TRODAT-1 single photon emission computed tomography. The post-processing analysis of the neuroimaging included voxel-based morphometry to assess the regional atrophy, tract-based spatial statistics related to white matter involvement, tractography to investigate the rostral and caudal projections from the midbrain level and specific uptake ratios of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 for presynaptic dopaminergic transporter activity. In susceptibility weighted imaging, low-intensity pallidoreticular lesions were detected from the minimal-intensity projections, which were visible in only 7.7 of the T1-weighted images and 15.4 of the T2-weighted images, whereas inhomogeneous intensities were detected in the globus pallidus. The patients were further divided into two subgroups based on the presence (n=13) or absence (n=12) of pallidoreticular lesions. The patients with pallidoreticular lesions showed increased parkinsonian features, poorer performances on the neuropsychiatric tests, lower 99mTc-TRODAT-1 availability in both the caudate and the putamen and greater atrophy of the thalamus, posterior corpus callosum, cerebral peduncle and white matter surrounding the globus pallidus compared to those without pallidoreticular lesions. The tractography results obtained with seed regions of interest in the substantia nigra showed rostral projections to the supplementary motor cortex and anterior cingulate cortex via the globus pallidus; the two pathways were distinct but ran in parallel, caudal to the level of the globus pallidus. In conclusion, the presence of pallidoreticular lesions after carbon monoxide intoxication indicates a poorer cognitive state, which is associated with extensive grey and white matter damage in addition to the damage to the nigra-striatal neuronal networks. The presence of parkinsonian features may be related to pallidal and presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction. The sensitivity for detecting pallidoreticular lesions can be greatly improved by using susceptibility weighted imaging compared with conventional imaging. © The Author (2011).

84855746817	Vascularization and restoration of heart function in rat myocardial infarction using transplantation of human cbMSC/HUVEC core-shell bodies	Cell transplantation is a promising strategy for therapeutic treatment of ischemic heart diseases. In this study, cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (cbMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in the form of core-shell bodies (cbMSC/HUVEC bodies) were prepared to promote vascularization and restore heart functions in an experimentally-created myocardial infarction (MI) rat model. Saline, cbMSC bodies and HUVEC bodies were used as controls. Invitro results indicated that cbMSC/HUVEC bodies possessed the capability of heterotypic assembly of cbMSCs and HUVECs into robust and durable tubular networks on Matrigel. The up-regulated gene expressions of VEGF and IGF-1 reflected the robust expansion of tubular networks; in addition, the augmented levels of SMA and SM22 suggested smooth muscle differentiation of cbMSCs, possibly helping to improve the durability of networks. Moreover, according to the invivo echocardiographic, magnetic resonance and computed-tomographic results, transplantation of cbMSC/HUVEC bodies benefited post-MI dysfunction. Furthermore, the vascularization analyses demonstrated the robust vasculogenic potential of cbMSC/HUVEC bodies invivo, thus contributing to the greater viable myocardium and the less scar region, and ultimately restoring the cardiac function. The concept of core-shell bodies composed of perivascular cells and endothelial cells may serve as an attractive cell delivery vehicle for vasculogenesis, thus improving the cardiac function significantly. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84862794812	Injectable PLGA porous beads cellularized by hAFSCs for cellular cardiomyoplasty	Cellular cardiomyoplasty has been limited by poor graft retention after cell transplantation. To ensure good retention of the engrafted cells, a microfluidic device was used to fabricate spherical porous beads of poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) as a platform for cell delivery. The beads thus obtained had a relatively uniform size, a highly porous structure, and a favorably interconnected interior architecture, to facilitate the transportation of oxygen and nutrients. These porous beads were loaded with human amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFSCs) to generate cellularized microscaffolds. Live/dead assay demonstrated that most of the cells in the porous constructs were viable. The hAFSCs that were grown in beads formed a complex three-dimensional organization with well-preserved extracellular matrices (ECM) according to their porous structure. Retention of the administered beads was clearly identified at the site of engraftment following an experimentally induced myocardial infarction in a rat model. The results of echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and histological analyses suggest that the transplantation of hAFSC beads into an infarcted heart could effectively maintain its gross morphology, prevent successive ventricular expansion, and thereby improve the post-infarcted cardiac function. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that the microenvironment that was provided by the infarcted myocardium might offer cues for the induction of the engrafted hAFSCs into angiogenic and cardiomyogenic lineages. Our results demonstrate that the cellularized beads with endogenously secreted ECM were of sufficient physical size to be entrapped in the interstitial tissues following transplantation, thereby benefiting the infarcted heart. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The tasks included gait initiation, stepping over an obstacle and gait termination using an event-related design. Subjects watched a video clip showing an actor walking and imagined the walking process. Results: At gait initiation, no significant difference could be found between PD and the Old controls. Activation in the visual related areas in the Old subjects was increased compared to the Young subjects. While imagining stepping over obstacles, the right dorsal premotor area (PMd), precentral, right inferior parietal lobule, and bilateral precuneus were more activated in PD compared to the Old. An extensive network of bilateral SMA, PMd, posterior parietal lobe and visual association areas was activated in the Old versus the Young subjects. At gait termination, visual related areas were noted when PD was compared to the Old. In contrast, increased activation in bilateral pre-SMA, PMd, ventral premotor area, precentral, posterior parietal lobes and visual association areas were activated in the Old when compared to the Young. Conclusions: Our study provides image based evidence for gait disturbance in PD patients and during normal aging. The compensatory cortical mechanism in the findings could be a background resource for further therapeutic interventions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863044088	Computer-aided diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease using multiple image features with hybrid PSO-SVM	Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has a high risk to convert into Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the related research, the volumetric analysis of hippocampus is the most extensive study. However, the segmentation and identification of the hippocampus are highly complicated and time-consuming. Therefore, we designed an MRI-based classification framework to distinguish the patients of MCI and AD from normal individuals. First, volumetric and shape features were extracted from MRI data. Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to decrease the dimensions of feature space. Support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained for classification. Finally, a hybrid classification system based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) improved the performance of the SVM classifier. With the hybrid classification framework based on PSO, the result achieved up to 95.35% and 82.35% in AD and in MCI. © 2012 ICIC International.

84872297747	Brain connectivity of patients with Alzheimer's disease by coherence and cross mutual information of electroencephalograms during photic stimulation	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, usually diagnosed by neuropsychological tests, and excluded from other cerebral diseases by brain images. An electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a means of disclosing the reduced functional couplings between brain regions that occurs with AD. In the present study, 16 probable AD patients and 15 age-matched, gender-matched normal subjects were enrolled. Spectral coherence and cross mutual information (CMI) were used to analyze EEGs during intermittent photic stimulation (PS). Ocular- and heartbeat-related source components (SCs) obtained from multi-channel EEGs by the independent component analysis were discarded, and the photic-related SCs were reduced using a comb filter. The undisturbed SCs and photic-related SCs before and after photic reduction were used to reconstruct photic-preserved EEGs and photic-reduced EEGs, from which harmonic coherences (direct photic-driving response) and rhythmic coherences and CMI (indirect photic affection) were computed, respectively. Our results indicate that the rhythmic coherences (particularly in the alpha and beta bands) and CMI variables as well as the harmonic coherences (particularly related to 3-Hz PS) were significantly lower in the probable AD than in normal subjects, whereas the variables derived from the resting EEGs were not statistically significant. This finding implied that the variables obtained during PS could be used to disclose impaired intra-brain associations in probable AD. © 2011 IPEM.

84875272575	Noninvasive monitoring of microvascular changes with partial irradiation using dynamic contrast-enhanced and blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging	Purpose: The microvasculature of a tumor plays an important role in its response to radiation therapy. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI) and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI are both sensitive to vascular characteristics. The present study proposed a partial irradiation approach to a xenograft tumor to investigate the intratumoral response to radiation therapy using DCE and BOLD MRI. Methods and Materials: TRAMP-C1 tumors were grown in C57BL/6J mice. Partial irradiation was performed on the distal half of the tumor with a single dose of 15 Gy. DCE MRI was performed to derive the endothelium transfer constant, K

84876911984	Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Mouse Islet Grafts Labeled with Novel Chitosan-Coated Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles	Object: To better understand the fate of islet isografts and allografts, we utilized a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique to monitor mouse islets labeled with a novel MR contrast agent, chitosan-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide (CSPIO) nanoparticles. Materials and Methods: After being incubated with and without CSPIO (10 μg/ml), C57BL/6 mouse islets were examined under transmission electron microscope (TEM) and their insulin secretion was measured. Cytotoxicity was examined in α (αTC1) and β (NIT-1 and βTC) cell lines as well as islets. C57BL/6 mice were used as donors and inbred C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice were used as recipients of islet transplantation. Three hundred islets were transplanted under the left kidney capsule of each mouse and then MR was performed in the recipients periodically. At the end of study, the islet graft was removed for histology and TEM studies. Results: After incubation of mouse islets with CSPIO (10 μg/mL), TEM showed CSPIO in endocytotic vesicles of α- and β-cells at 8 h. Incubation with CSPIO did not affect insulin secretion from islets and death rates of αTC1, NIT-1 and βTC cell lines as well as islets. After syngeneic and allogeneic transplantation, grafts of CSPIO-labeled islets were visualized on MR scans as persistent hypointense areas. At 8 weeks after syngeneic transplantation and 31 days after allogeneic transplantation, histology of CSPIO-labeled islet grafts showed colocalized insulin and iron staining in the same areas but the size of allografts decreased with time. TEM with elementary iron mapping demonstrated CSPIO distributed in the cytoplasm of islet cells, which maintained intact ultrastructure. Conclusion: Our results indicate that after syngeneic and allogeneic transplantation, islets labeled with CSPIO nanoparticles can be effectively and safely imaged by MR. © 2013 Juang et al.

84878631954	Discrimination between Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment using SOM and PSO-SVM	In this study, an MRI-based classification framework was proposed to distinguish the patients with AD and MCI from normal participants by using multiple features and different classifiers. First, we extracted features (volume and shape) from MRI data by using a series of image processing steps. Subsequently, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to convert a set of features of possibly correlated variables into a smaller set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables, decreasing the dimensions of feature space. Finally, we developed a novel data mining framework in combination with support vector machine (SVM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for the AD/MCI classification. In order to compare the hybrid method with traditional classifier, two kinds of classifiers, that is, SVM and a self-organizing map (SOM), were trained for patient classification. With the proposed framework, the classification accuracy is improved up to 82.35% and 77.78% in patients with AD and MCI. The result achieved up to 94.12% and 88.89% in AD and MCI by combining the volumetric features and shape features and using PCA. The present results suggest that novel multivariate methods of pattern matching reach a clinically relevant accuracy for the a priori prediction of the progression from MCI to AD. © 2013 Shih-Ting Yang et al.

84881352986	Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MR Imaging Predicts Local Control in Oropharyngeal or Hypopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treated with Chemoradiotherapy	The role of pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging (DCE-PWI) and diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) in predicting the treatment response of oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OHSCC) to chemoradiation remains unclear. We prospectively investigated the ability of pharmacokinetic parameters derived from pretreatment DCE-PWI and DWI to predict the local control of OHSCC patients treated with chemoradiation. Between August, 2010 and March, 2012, patients with untreated OHSCC scheduled for chemoradiation were eligible for this prospective study. DCE-PWI and DWI were performed in addition to conventional MRI. The relationship of local control with the following clinical and imaging variables was analyzed: the hemoglobin level, T-stage, tumor location, gross tumor volume, maximum standardized uptake value, metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis on FDG PET/CT, transfer constant (K

84895794390	Sex dimorphism of cortical water diffusion in normal aging measured by magnetic resonance imaging	Background: The purpose of this study was to examine sex dimorphism in water diffusion in the brain throughout the normal aging process by magnetic resonance imaging. Methods: Diffusion-weighted images covering the majority of the brain were acquired from 77 healthy participants. Both the mean water diffusivity and diffusion kurtosis were calculated from the cortical regions and parcellated according to the template in anatomical automatic labeling. The mean water diffusivity and diffusion kurtosis from both sexes were examined and subsequently correlated with age. Statistical significance was set at a threshold of p < 0.01 after correction for multiple comparisons. In regions that reached statistical significance, a linear regression model was performed. Analysis of variance was conducted to determine the interaction between aging and sex. Results: Sex differences were observed for three aspects. First, compared to females, males presented increased mean water diffusivity and a decreased diffusion kurtosis in the frontal and temporal lobes. Second, a widespread age-related increase in mean water diffusivity was observed, which was more significant in the frontal, occipital, and temporal areas and in the cingulum in females. Third, the diffusion kurtosis decreased with aging but only in restricted areas for both sexes. For the interaction of aging and sex, the most significant change was observed with regards to mean diffusivity, mostly in the right amygdala. Conclusions: A sex-related dimorphism in water diffusion throughout the aging process was observed in the cortex using magnetic resonance imaging. © 2013 Ng, Hsu, Wai, Lee, Chan, Chen, Fung, Wu, Tsai and Wang.

84897382302	Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Its Applications in Movement Disorders	This chapter reviews the basic principles of diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in a comprehensive manner, including both diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We introduce the effect of water diffusion on MR signal and methods used to measure the diffusion coefficient using MRI. The diffusion tensor and tensor-derived indices are presented in an effort to characterize the anisotropic nature of in vivo diffusion. Tractography using DTI is also discussed. The second part of this chapter describes the recent findings in various neurological movement disorders using diffusion imaging, including idiopathic Parkinson disease (iPD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The discussion includes studies based on regions located in the basal ganglia where changes of water diffusion coefficient have been reported, and impairment of white matter integrity where DTI has been most successful. The limitations of various diffusion imaging methods are discussed. The third part of this chapter presents an overview of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), an advanced technique for measurement of restricted and hindered water diffusion in biological environments that significantly improves sensitivity and specificity when compared with conventional DTI.

84901783927	Tract-based spatial statistics: Application to mild cognitive impairment	Rationale and Objectives. The primary objective of the current investigation was to characterize white matter integrity in different subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using tract-based spatial statistics of diffusion tensor imaging. Materials and Methods. The study participants were divided into 4 groups of 30 subjects each as follows: cognitively healthy controls, amnestic MCI, dysexecutive MCI, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). All subjects underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, apolipoprotein E genotyping, and 3-tesla MRI. The diffusion tensor was reconstructed and then analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics. The changes in brain white matter tracts were also examined according to the apolipoprotein E ε4 status. Results. Compared with controls, amnestic MCI patients showed significant differences in the cerebral white matter, where changes were consistently detectable in the frontal and parietal lobes. We found a moderate impact of the apolipoprotein E ε4 status on the extent of white matter disruption in the amnestic MCI group. Patients with AD exhibited similar but more extensive alterations, while no significant changes were observed in dysexecutive MCI patients. Conclusion. The results from this study indicate that amnestic MCI is the most likely precursor to AD as both conditions share significant white matter damage. By contrast, dysexecutive MCI seems to be characterized by a distinct pathogenesis. © 2014 Yau-Yau Wai et al.

84904319430	Magnetic-resonance imaging for kinetic analysis of permeability changes during focused ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier opening and brain drug delivery	Focused ultrasound (FUS) with the presence of microbubbles has been shown to induce transient and local opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for the delivery of therapeutic molecules which normally cannot penetrate into the brain. The success of FUS brain-drug delivery relies on its integration with in-vivo imaging to monitor kinetic change of therapeutic molecules into the brain. In this study, we developed a dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) technique for kinetic analysis of delivered molecules during FUS-BBB opening.
