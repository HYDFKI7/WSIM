84933672772	Tactile priming modulates the activation of the fronto-parietal circuit during tactile angle match and non-match processing: An fMRI study	The repetition of a stimulus task reduces the neural activity within certain cortical regions responsible for working memory (WM) processing. Although previous evidence has shown that repeated vibrotactile stimuli reduce the activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, whether the repeated tactile spatial stimuli triggered the priming effect correlated with the same cortical region remains unclear. Therefore, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a delayed match-to-sample task to investigate the contributions of the priming effect to tactile spatial WM processing. Fourteen healthy volunteers were asked to encode three tactile angle stimuli during the encoding phase and one tactile angle stimulus during the recognition phase. Then, they answered whether the last angle stimulus was presented during the encoding phase. As expected, both the Match and Non-Match tasks activated a similar cerebral network. The critical new finding was decreased brain activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and bilateral medial frontal gyri (mFG) for the match task compared to the Non-Match task. Therefore, we suggest that the tactile priming engaged repetition suppression mechanisms during tactile angle matching, and this process decreased the activation of the fronto-parietal circuit, including IFG, mFG and PPC.

84942515336	Chinese phonological processing for Japanese in Chinese-Japanese bilinguals: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study	Writing and reading in a second language (L2) is a difficult processing that involves reciprocation between the native language (L1) and second language. In older to investigate the fundamental mechanisms, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to visualize Japanese-Chinese bilinguals' brain activity in phonological processing of Chinese and Japanese words. We utilized fMRI to investigate brain activations in processing Japanese phonological and font size by visual judgment tasks in 15 Japanese subjects. Different activation patterns were observed between phonological and font size judgment processing. We conclude that a group of neural substrates was different for the Chinese-Japanese second language phonological processing.

84942524321	Mechanisms of visual-auditory temporal processing for artificial intelligence	In everyday life, our brains integrate various kinds of information from different modalities to perceive our complex environment. Temporal synchrony of audiovisual stimuli is required for audiovisual integration. Many studies have shown that temporal asynchrony of visual-auditory stimuli can influence the interaction between visual and auditory stimulus, however, the multisensory mechanisms of asynchrony inputs were not well understood. In present study, visual and auditory stimuli onset asynchrony (SOA= ±250 ms, ±200 ms, ±150 ms, ±100 ms, ±50 ms, 0 ms), only the auditory stimulus was attended. From the behavioral results, the responses to temporal asynchronous audiovisual stimuli were more accurate than unimodal auditory stimuli. The most significant enhancement was SOA = -100ms condition (the visual preceding), which reaction time was the fastest. These results revealed the basis of audiovisual interaction in which audiovisual stimuli presented with different SOA. The temporal alignment of visual-auditory stimuli can enhance the auditory detection. The study can offer basic theory for artificial intelligence.

17644374765	Building a data-mining Grid for multiple human brain data analysis	E-science is about global collaboration in key areas of science such as cognitive science and brain science, and the next generation of infrastructure such as the Wisdom Web and Knowledge Grids. As a case study, we investigate human multiperception mechanism by cooperatively using various psychological experiments, physiological measurements, and data mining techniques for developing artificial systems which match human ability in specific aspects. In particular, we observe fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and EEG (electroencephalogram) brain activations from the viewpoint of peculiarity oriented mining and propose a way of peculiarity oriented mining for knowledge discovery in multiple human brain data. Based on such experience and needs, we concentrate on the architectural aspect of a brain-informatics portal from the perspective of the Wisdom Web and Knowledge Grids. We describe how to build a data-mining grid on the Wisdom Web for multiaspect human brain data analysis. The proposed methodology attempts to change the perspective of cognitive scientists from a single type of experimental data analysis toward a holistic view at a long-term, global field of vision. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing.

33645320843	Retinotopic organization of the peripheral visual field in [7] human primary visual cortex by fMRI	We investigated that the retinotopic organization of the peripheral visual field within human visual cortex using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To create the eccentricity map including more peripheral visual field, we designed a new experimental tool, which can stimulate the retina with expanded eccentricities by flickering light. When the subjects were stimulated by more peripheral stimuli, the activated areas of their primary visual cortex are located on the more anterior part. Our findings are consistent with previous measurement of the eccentricities on human primary visual cortex and give complementary ones about the retinotopic organization of higher peripheral vision. © 2005 SICE.

38349162051	Web intelligence meets brain informatics	In this chapter, we outline a vision of Web Intelligence (WI) research from the viewpoint of Brain Informatics (BI), a new interdisciplinary field that systematically studies the mechanisms of human information processing from both the macro and micro viewpoints by combining experimental cognitive neuroscience with advanced information technology. BI studies human brain from the viewpoint of informatics (i.e., human brain is an information processing system) and uses informatics (i.e., WI centric information technology) to support brain science study. Advances in instrumentation, e.g., based on fMRI and information technologies offer more opportunities for research in both Web intelligence and brain sciences. Further understanding of human intelligence through brain sciences fosters innovative Web intelligence research and development. WI portal techniques provide a powerful new platform for brain sciences. The synergy between WI and BI advances our ways of analyzing and understanding of data, knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom, as well as their interrelationships, organizations, and creation processes. Web intelligence is becoming a central field that revolutionizes information technologies and artificial intelligence to achieve human-level Web intelligence. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

80052330209	Programmable tactile pattern presentations operational under MRI to investigate neural mechanisms of tactile shape discrimination	We have developed a novel tactile presentation system for assessing and training cognitive function on tactile senses. The device is operational in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment and capable of investigating the underlying neural mechanisms of tactile pattern discrimination. The primary components of the system include a finger movement control unit (FCU), a disk for multiple tactile pattern delivery (DPD), and a force-sensing unit (FSU). An ultrasonic motor rotates the DPD to deliver different tactile patterns for cognitive sensitivity test. We evaluated the operational reliability and the performance of the system in a MRI environment. The results showed that the system performance was not affected by the magnetic field, nor did the system operation interfere with the magnetic field either. The results from the two functional MRI experiments also indicated that the brain activation can be reliably detected with the present system. Furthermore, a tactile pattern discrimination experiment was conducted using the system to investigate cognitive characteristics of shape discrimination under active and passive touch conditions. We found that the mean accuracy of discrimination under active touch was significantly higher than that under passive touch. The high accuracy and magnetic field compatibility of the device suggest that the device provides a powerful means of investigating the neural mechanisms of perception and cognitive function for touch discrimination. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84861629717	The ebbinghaus illusion affects visual size perception but not pointing movement	Ebbinghaus illusion is commonly used as an example of a visual size-contrast effect. The aim of present study was to examine the effects of visual illusion performance on pointing movements. Twenty healthy subjects performed two pointing movement experiments with different visual illusion conditions. Central circular targets of five different sizes were presented on a large semitransparent screen. In experiment 1, subjects were asked to look at the visual targets first and adjust the size of the right central circle to match the left central circle. Next, subjects were asked to point to the right central circle as quickly and as accurately as possible. In experiment 2, all subjects were asked only to point to the right central circle in the same manner as in experiment 1 but without the previous size adjustment. The findings of the present study suggest that the Ebbinghaus illusion affects visual size perception but does not affect pointing movements. This result suggests that visual size illusion changes only the perceived size of visual stimuli during the movement-planning period but not online control processes. ©2012 International Information Institute.

84897575895	SII and the fronto-parietal areas are involved in visually cued tactile top-down spatial attention: A functional MRI study	Visual cue-oriented, tactile top-down attention (vTA) has been well investigated behaviorally. However, vTA-related brain activation remains unclear, and whether SI (primary somatosensory cortex) or SII (secondary somatosensory cortex) is modulated by the top-down process of tactile cognition remains particularly controversial. We used the Posner paradigm in which a visual spatial cue directed attention to a tactile target [tactile spatial attention (TS) task]. The TS is compared with a visual nonspatially cued, tactile attention task [tactile neutral attention (TN) task]. The behavioral results showed no significant differences between the TS and TN tasks. However, we considered the possibility that the visual spatial hint affected the TS neural network. Brain-imaging data showed that the inferior parietal lobe was activated more during the TS task than during the TN task. Furthermore, we present evidence to support SII modulation by top-down processing during the TS task. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84897031948	Similar ventral occipito-temporal cortex activations in literate and illiterate adults during the Chinese character matching task: An fMRI study	Visual word expertise is typically associated with enhanced ventral occipito-temporal (vOT) cortex activation in response to written words. Previous study utilized a passive viewing task and found that vOT response to written words was significantly stronger in literate compared to the illiterate subjects. However, recent neuroimaging findings have suggested that vOT response properties are highly dependent upon the task demand. Thus, it is unknown whether literate adults would show stronger vOT response to written words compared to illiterate adults during other cognitive tasks, such as perceptual matching. We addressed this issue by comparing vOT activations between literate and illiterate adults during a Chinese character and simple figure matching task. Unlike passive viewing, a perceptual matching task requires active shape comparison, therefore minimizing automatic word processing bias. We found that although the literate group performed better at Chinese character matching task, the two subject groups showed similar strong vOT responses during this task. Overall, the findings indicate that the vOT response to written words is not affected by expertise during a perceptual matching task, suggesting that the association between visual word expertise and vOT response may depend on the task demand. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

48149087733	Development of a wide-view visual presentation system in the fMRI environment	Retinotopic mapping is one of the most important experimental procedures in brain mapping the human visual system. Due to technical problems in previous studies applying fMRI retinotopy on human subjects, which typically used a central and/or pericentral visual field stimulus (8-30 deg of eccentricity from the fixation point), retinotopic characteristics of peripheral vision in humans are still unclear. To overcome this obstacle, we developed the wide-view visual presentation system with a horizontal visual angle of 120 deg and a vertical angle of 120 deg using nonmagnetic optical fibers and contact lens for fMRI. In this paper, we introduce the functions and performance of this system and report the results of our evaluative experiment. © 2007 IEEE.

48149089959	Attention systems and neural responses to visual and auditory stimuli: An fMRI study	Visual orienting attention has been researched thoroughly using visual cues, and spatial attention and temporal attention have been compared using brain-imaging data [1]. However, while several studies have reported on auditory attention, the attention was not oriented using a cue. In addition, fewer studies have compared spatial and temporal attention using auditory stimuli. We compared visual and auditory orienting attention using a visual cue. We asked whether a general system exists for auditory spatial and temporal attention that conforms to that of visual spatial and temporal attention. We measured brain activity in 16 healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The attention was manipulated spatially and temporally using a visual cue for both visual and auditory tasks in a factorial design. Symbolic central cues oriented the subjects toward spatial location only (left or right), toward the temporal interval only (300 or 1800 ms), or gave no information about the spatial location or temporal interval. The subjects were also scanned under a resting basetine condition during which they clicked the reaction key ten times. Behavioral data showed the same tendency in visual and auditory tasks. The reaction time for spatial location attention was faster than that for temporal interval attention. The brain-imaging data showed a partial overlap between visual spatial attention and auditory spatial attention. In addition, it revealed a partial overlap between the neural systems involved in the performance of visual spatial attention versus visual temporal attention. The parietal and frontal cortices were activated in both the visual and auditory spatial attention tasks. The parietal cortex was activated in the visual temporal attention task only and not in the auditory temporal task. ©2007 IEEE.

48149090337	Development and evaluation of a device for presenting tactile stimuli	We are especially interested in the human ability to recognize shape using the delayed matching paradigm in active and passive touch studies. To investigate the characteristics of shape recognition, stimulus presentation control is very important because a subtle difference in the stimulus presentation will influence the results. In this study, we propose a new device that precisely controls the stimulus presentation and performs psychobehavioral measurements in haptics studies. And we also conducted an active/passive shape discrimination experiment to evaluate the performance of the device. Twenty right-handed students consented to participate in the experiment. The results suggest that the device might serve as a comprehensive haptic device that allows different types of haptic stimuli to be presented precisely to subjects to measure various psychobehavioral parameters. © 2007 IEEE.

48149099375	Effects of modality-specific attention on audiovisual early integration	Audiovisual early integration was investigated in humans using behavioral and electrophysiological measures in the attending one-modality (visual/auditory) condition to determine whether audiovisual early integration occurs when one modality is attended. Visual, auditory, and audiovisual stimuli were presented randomly with equal probability. The subjects were instructed to press a button in response to an infrequent target stimulus (20%) in the attend-designated modality. Reaction times (RTs) and accuracy were recorded and were compared using paired t-tests. The event-related potentials (ERPs) to bimodal stimuli (AV) were compared with the sum of the ERPs to unimodal auditory (A) and visual (V) stimuli. The early integration process was expressed as the difference waveform between AV and (A+V). Audiovisual early integration (P100) of the bimodal audiovisual stimuli was found in the scalp topographies in the attending auditory condition; moreover, the RTs to the bimodal audiovisual target stimuli were faster than the RTs to the unimodal auditory target stimuli. By contrast, in the attending visual condition, audiovisual early integration (P100) of the bimodal audiovisual stimuli was not found in the scalp topographies, and no significant RT difference was observed between the unimodal visual and bimodal audiovisual target stimuli. © 2007 IEEE.

51749095078	Time dissociative characteristics of numerical inductive reasoning: Behavioral and ERP evidence	Although some preliminary spatial localization results have been reported, the temporal characteristics of human inductive reasoning process have not been investigated. In the present study, event-related potential (ERP) was used to explore the time course of inductive reasoning process. Based on pilot studies and some other related research, we hypothesized that the process of numerical inductive reasoning is composed of number recognition, strategy formation, hypothesis generation and validation, and the above three stages are (partially) dissociable over time. A typical task of inductive reasoning, function-finding, was adopted. Induction tasks and calculation tasks were performed in the experiments, respectively. The mean reaction time of induction tasks was much longer than that of calculation tasks as expected. Statistical analysis revealed that induction showed no significant separations from calculation for the early ERP components and the slow waveforms after about 600ms, while marked dissociations appeared for the late components in the time window of about 250-600ms. It can be preliminarily concluded that, the early components before about 250ms may reflect the process of attention and number recognition, the late components may relate to strategy formation, and hypothesis generation and validation may be performed in about 600-1200ms. On the whole, the results on the behavioral data and ERP data support our hypothesis. ©2007 IEEE.

64949095467	A study on human audiovisual integration by behavioural and event-related potentials (ERPs) measurements for traffic safety	In this study, audiovisual integration for only attending visual component of bimodal audiovisual stimulus was investigated in humans using behavioral and electrophysiological measures. The aim was to explore human's information integration mechanism and give theoretic basic for Traffic safety. Event-related potentials (ERPs) to auditory (A), visual (V) and bimodal audiovisual (AV) stimuli were recorded. Audiovisual integration is revealed in the difference between the ERPs to the bimodal AV stimulus and the sum of the ERPs to A and V stimulus. Results show that audiovisual integration was not found during early sensory processing phase (up to 200ms post stimulus onset). Audiovisual integration was found firstly over central scalp around 300ms. For only attending visual component of bimodal audiovisual information, simultaneously presented visual and auditory information were processed separately in early sensory processing phase, and in late phase audiovisual information was integrated. © 2008 IEEE.

While previous studies have compared performance between alphabetic subjects, few data were about Chinese-speaking individuals. In this study, we used fMRI to investigate brain activations in processing characters and figures by visual tasks in 26 Chinese subjects (13 illiterates and 13 literates). Different activation patterns were observed in not only Chinese character judgment task, but also simple figure judgment task between literates and illiterates. We conclude that constellation of neural substrates was different for literates and illiterates and education may enhance this brain plasticity. ©2009 IEEE.

67650669933	Development of a dual tactile pattern presentation device using in MRI environment	We have developed a novel tactile pattern presentation device to assess tactile cognitive function by active, passive and dual touch. The device is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible and can serve to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms of tactile pattern discrimination. The primary components of the system are one disk for pattern presentation (DPP) driven by an ultrasonic motor, one set of fingers position control unit and one reaction key pad. In order to evaluate the performance of the presentation device, two functional MRI tasks were executed. First, we used MRI-Phantom to test the practicability of the tactile pattern presentation device. Second, we designed a tactile raised line cognitive task with five young subjects to investigate the brain activity areas concerning tactile shape cognition by dual touch. The results suggested that this device to be unaffected by the magnetic field, and the brain imaging results were consistent with previous neuroimaging study. The most significantly of present study is that the device provides a powerful means of investigating neural mechanisms of perception and cognitive function for touch discrimination. ©2009 IEEE.

67650669934	Visual field representation and location of visual area V1 in human visual cortex by functional MRI	Human area V1 offers an excellent opportunity to study, using functional MRI, a range of properties in a specific cortical visual area, whose borders are defined objectively and convergently by retinotopic criteria. Previous fMRI studies in V1 retinotopic are typically used central and/or peri-central visual field stimulus. The retinotopic characteristics on human peripheral vision are still not well known. In this study, we developed a new visual presentation system widest view (60 deg of eccentricity). The wide-view visual presentation system was made from nonmagnetic optical fibers and a contact lens, so can use in general clinical fMRI condition and the cost is lower. We used the newly wide view visual presentation system, firstly get a success in the world to identify human primary visual cortex (V1) of the eccentricity 60 deg. And we acquired the areal cortical magnification function for V1 between the 0-60deg eccentricities was Mareal =272/(E+1.44)2. The mean cortical surface area of V1 between the 0-60deg eccentricities was about 2229mm2. Our results have well agreement with the using physiological, patients and anatomical measurements. The analysis indicates that (1) the estimate of scaling factor in linear magnification factors is larger than previous studies which focus on central vision. (2) the estimate of the peripheral factor in dipolar model is too large to make the curve direction of the iso-eccentricity ring's in the periphery be the same as that on the center in V1. ©2009 IEEE.

67650678679	The influence of spatial congruency on audiovisual interaction in a visual-attention task	The influence of spatial congruency on audiovisual interaction in a visual-attention task in which only the visual segment of a bimodal audiovisual stimulus was required to attend was investigated using behavioral and electrophysiological measures in humans. The behavioral results showed that the responses to audiovisual target stimuli were faster than that to unimodal visual target stimuli. Moreover, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) to unimodal visual stimuli, unimodal auditory stimuli, spatially congruent, and incongruent bimodal audiovisual stimuli. The audiovisual interaction effects were detected by comparing the ERPs to audiovisual stimuli with the sum or the ERPs to unimodal visual and auditory stimuli. The ERPs results showed audiovisual interaction were detected as a negativity in mid-central scalp sites at around a latency of 300 ms during the later stage of processing under both a spatially congruent condition and incongruent condition. But the amplitude around 300ms was significantly larger than that under a spatially congruent condition. Thus, audiovisual interaction depends on the spatial congruity of the bimodal audiovisual stimuli. ©2009 IEEE.

Where and When to pay attention: the neural systems for directing attention to spatial locations and to time intervals as revealed by both PET and fMRI. Journal of Neuroscience, 1998, 18, 7426-7435]. We developed to compare visual spatial orienting attention and visual temporal orienting attention by using a visual cue. We designed a control task in which subjects had to click the response key the same times consistant with spatial task and temporal task. As a result, the brain activations by clicking response key were removed in the result. We measured brain activity in eighteen healthy volunteers by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the task, the attention was manipulated to spatial and temporal by a visual cue. A neutral task also performed in which a neutral cue was used. Symbolic central cues oriented subjects toward spatial location only (left or right), toward temporal intervals only (300 msec or 1500 msec), or gave no information about spatial location and temporal intervals. Subjects also scanned during a resting baseline condition in which subjects clicked the reaction key ten times. The reaction time for spatial location attention is speedy than that for temporal interval attention. Brain-imaging data showed that IPL(inferior parietal lobe) and ACC(anterior cingulated cortex) were activated in the visual spatial attention task.

Currently, no medical tests are available to diagnose AD conclusively pre-mortem. However, a large number of Kungsholmen Project studies used cognitive tasks (i.e. visuospatial tasks, language tasks, etc.) attempted to find the preclinical cognitive marks of AD. These studies convincingly demonstrate that the cognitive deficits of AD are possible to detect during a preclinical period spans several years. In addition, numerous neuropathological, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies supports the hypothesis that the cognitive deficits in AD is related to a possible disconnection between cortical areas. In present article, we describe the present and future researches of early diagnosis method through cognitive and functional imaging testing to help with the clinical diagnosis. ©2009 IEEE.

67650711944	Tactile perception of two lengths by precision griping with three forefingers	When an object is touched, the properties like shape, temperature, rigidity, texture and weight should be perceived. As a basic research of human tactile, it is most important to know how humans could perceive the shape of the object with forefingers. Thus length and contacting curvature of an object are thought to provide important perception information. Most of the length perception studies are about two fingers using the thumb and the index finger. There are scarce perception studies using multi-fingers grasping. In present study, we develop a tactile length presentation device for two lengths with three forefingers, and investigate the human tactile length perception for two lengths with three forefingers grasping. The results showed that better perception took place when shorter lengths were presented to the thumb and the index finger compared to being presented to the thumb and the middle finger. As a result of force sensor, grip forces show no significant difference in the range of stimulating length. ©2009 IEEE.

74249095687	Multisensory interactions elicited by audiovisual stimuli presented peripherally in a visual attention Task: A behavioral and event-related potential study in humans	We applied behavioral and event-related potential measurements to study human multisensory interactions induced by audiovisual (AV) stimuli presented peripherally in a visual attention task in which an irrelevant auditory stimulus occasionally accompanied the visual stimulus. A stream of visual, auditory, and AV stimuli was randomly presented to the left or right side of the subjects; subjects covertly attended to the visual stimuli on either the left or right side and promptly responded to visual targets on that side. Behavioral results showed that responses to AV stimuli were faster and more accurate than those to visual stimuli only. Three event-related potential components related to AV interactions were identified: (1) over the right temporal area, approximately 200 to 220 milliseconds; (2) over the centromedial area, approximately 290 to 310 milliseconds; and (3) over the left and right ventral temporal area, approximately 290 to 310 milliseconds. We found that these interaction effects occurred slightly later than those reported in previously published AV interaction studies in which AV stimuli were presented centrally. Our results suggest that the retinotopic location of stimuli affects AV interactions occurring at later stages of cognitive processing in response to a visual attention task.

76449122173	Audiovisual interaction enhances auditory detection in late stage: An event-related potential study	Although many behavioral studies have investigated auditory detection enhancement by crossmodal audiovisual interaction, the results are controversial. In addition, no neuroimaging studies that identify this phenomenon have been conducted. Therefore, we used event-related potential (ERP) measures to investigate this phenomenon by comparing the ERPs elicited by the audiovisual stimuli to the sum of the ERPs elicited by the visual and auditory stimuli, and identified two brain regions that showed significantly different responses: the centro-medial area at 280-300 ms after the presentation of the stimulus and the right fronto-temporal area at 300-320 ms after the presentation of the stimulus. The ERP results suggested that the behavioral enhancement of auditory detection results from late-stage cognitive processes rather than early-stage sensory processes. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

While previous studies have compared performance in visual tasks, few data adopted auditory tasks, especially in Chinesespeaking individuals. In this study, we used fMRI to investigate brain activations in processing characters by auditory tasks in 26 Chinese subjects (13 illiterates and 13 literates). After comparison of the language stimuli to the control stimuli, we observed: activation regions in the literate group involve the left superior temporal gyrus (BA22), right inferior frontal gyrus (BA47), left middle frontal gyrus (BA9), right middle temporal gyrus (BA21), dorsal anterior cingulate (BA32), and left middle frontal gyrus (BA6); in the illiterate group, activations occur in the right middle temporal gyrus (BA21), left superior temporal gyrus (BA22) and left inferior frontal gyrus (BA47). Conclusively, the left middle frontal gyrus (BA9) is strongly related to Chinese character processing and this modulated brain plasticity may be acquired by literacy and education. ©2009 IEEE.

A stream of visual (V), auditory (A), spatially congruent audiovisual (AV-Con), and spatially incongruent audiovisual (AV-Inc) stimuli were randomly presented to the left and/or right side; subjects covertly attended to the auditory stimuli on either the left or right side and promptly responded to auditory targets on that side. In present study, we only investigated the results which were related with multisensory interactions of audiovisual stimuli presented at different locations. ERPs to A, V-Inc which is at opposite locations with A, and AV-Inc stimuli were recorded. The neural basis of multisensory interactions of audiovisual stimuli presented at different location was studied by comparing ERPs to the AV-Inc stimuli with the sum of the ERPs to the unimodal A and V-Inc stimuli. ERPs results showed that main audiovisual interactions were found as a negativity in mid-central scalp sites around a latency of 300ms during the later stage of processing. The present results revealed the neural basis of multisensory interaction of audiovisual stimuli presented at different locations in an auditory-attention task.

77957769777	Wide-field retinotopy distinguish subregions of the human MT+ by functional magnetic resonance imaging	In humans, In humans, functional imaging studies have demonstrated a homologue of the macaque motion complex, MT+ suggested to contain both middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST), in the ascending limb of the inferior temporal sulcus. Two of the most well studied areas are MT and MST. Macaque area MST has been shown to have considerably larger receptive fields than area MT. The receptive fields of MT cells typically extend only a few degrees into the ipsilateral visual field, while area MST neurons have receptive fields that extend well into the ipsilateral visual field. However, for human most studies thus far have only concentrated on the center and/or peri-center of the visual field. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) distinguish putative human areas MST from MT+ by wide-view stimuli. Random dots stimuli placed in the four steps (0∼8°, 8∼16°, 16∼32°, 32∼64° eccentricity) field, produced a large cluster of functional activation in our subjects consistent with previous reports of human area MT. Wide-field random dots stimuli limited to the peripheral retina produced activation only in an anterior subsection of the MT+ complex, likely corresponding to putative MST [Fig. 1A, B]. We also investigated the retinotopy characteristic of MT+ [Fig. 1C, DJ. The retinotopy stimulus was a 60° diameter circular aperture filled with white dots on a black background. At any given time, the dots within a 45° wedge of the aperture moved inward/outward from fixation as in the MT+ localizer stimulus. © 2010 IEEE.

77957769778	The contribution of bilateral working memory and parietal activation in audiovisual voluntary spatial and temporal attention	Visual cue in the top-down attention mechanism was investigated that it could effectively improve the target cognition reaction quality. Recent brain studies showed that the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) played an important role to keep the task-relevant information and task rule during tasks. In this study, we focused on the neural network of attention and the function of rDLPFC, whether it modulates the attention during visual and auditory divided spatial and temporal attention. We used a top-down attention paradigm in which a visual cue directs the attention of participants to both visual and auditory target stimulus in a spatial (attention was directed to unilateral target distinctly) in VAS (visual auditory spatial) task and a temporal (attention was directed to a time point alternatively although humans are difficult to pay attention to a time point clearly) in VAT (visual auditory temporal) attention task. A non-informative cue task was also carried out in VAN (visual auditory neutral) task in order to observe the activation of working memory. Behavioral data showed no significant difference between VAS, VAT and VAN by twos. The parietal and frontal cortices were activated in both the VAS and VAT attention tasks. Furthermore, in the VAS and VAT attention task, it used a bilateral frontal-parietal network to modulate the cognition of visual and auditory target. But inthe VAT attention task, right parietal cortex was not activ ated as well as the VAS task. The activation of DLPFC shows st ronger in the spatial attention task than the temporal task, and in a non-informative cue task, the activation of DLPFC is the lo west in the three tasks. © 2010 IEEE.

77957776249	Effects of spatial attention on audiovisual integration at an incongruent location	The effects of attention on audiovisual integration at an incongruent location was investigated using behavioral measures in humans. A stream of unimodal visual (V), unimodal auditory (A), spatially congruent bimodal audiovisual (AV-Con) and spatially incongruent bimodal audiovisual (AV-Inc) stimuli were randomly presented to the left or right side; subjects covertly attended to all stimuli on one side (left or right) and promptly responded to all target stimuli on that side. The results showed that responses to the bimodal target stimuli were faster and more accurate than those to unimodal visual or atuditory target stimuli when audiovisual stimuli were presented on spatially congruent location. When audiovisual stimuli were presented on spatially incongruent location, responses to visual stimuli that were accompanied by simultaneous task-relevant, but spatially incongruent auditory stimuli were facilitated. However responses to auditory stimuli that were accompanied by simultaneous task-relevant, but spatially incongruent visual stimuli were not facilitated. The results suggested that vision was high preferential processing when auditory and visual information were simultaneously presented on spatially incongruent location. © 2010 IEEE.

77957801292	Different occipito-temporal activations in Chinese literate and illiterate subjects during Chinese character processing	Recent imaging studies have identified a region in occipito-temporal cortex essential for reading and labeled it as the visual word form area (VWFA). Several studies suggested that the development of this word specific region is closely related to the experience with words. In this study, two groups of Chinese subjects, one literate and the other illiterate, were asked to compare two Chinese characters presented at left and right side of a fixation point and decide whether they were the same character or not. Similar comparison of simple figures was used as control condition. We found stronger activation to Chinese characters than to simple figures in left and right hemispheric occipito-temporal regions in both literate and illiterate subjects. However, at the peak voxels revealed by Chinese character and simple figure contrast, the response to Chinese character stimuli in left occipito-temporal region of literate subjects was significantly stronger than that in the right one, whereas in illiterate subjects no such hemispheric preference was observed. We propose that the enhancement of the left peak voxel activation in literate group is due to their long-time acquaintance with reading. © 2010 IEEE.

77957818633	Chinese character and figure cognitive processing in the left Broca's area on inflated cortex	The cerebral cortex is the main target of analysis in many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies; statistical analysis can be restricted to the subset of the voxels obtained after cortex segmentation. We used a event-related design and contrasted the cognitive processing of Chinese character and figure in left Brodmann areas 44 and 45, which constitute Broca's region, in Chinese-speaking individual. Participants carried out a visual judgments task on a list of randomly intermixed Chinese characters and figure. The fMRI data were mapped directly onto cortical surface models. Processing of Chinese characters and figure judgments activated a comparable network of brain regions. In Broca's area, the Chinese character judgment task is also similar but more activations than figure judgment task. The result confirms a popular view that this area plays a role in grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. © 2010 IEEE.

78249240344	Investigation on human characteristics of Japanese katakana recognition by active touch	Braille is one of the few reading systems where tactile perception is used. However, one important issue of Braille is that that is difficult to learn, especially for elderly. Thus, there is a need to develop a new reading system which presents letters directly for blind people. The aim of present study is to investigate the human characteristics of katakana recognition by active touch for tactile reading system development. In present experiment, ten healthy young subjects were asked to recognize 46 Japanese katakana by active touch. The raised-Japanese katakana characters were made of Duralumin, and the height of these stimuli were 10mm. Subjects were instructed to touch the katakana stimuli with their right index finger without large submovement. The mean accuracy of all young subjects was over 80%, and the mean reaction time was about 27.3 s. Our results indicated that the mean accuracy was decreased with similarity increased. However, several differences with regard to high accuracy under high similarity pair conditions need to be considered. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

78650649970	Novel neuroimaging technique and measurement of contrast sensitivity with wide-view stimuli in human visual cortex	Using a novel wide-view visual presentation system for vision research developed by us and visual retinotopic mapping functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We have investigated the variation of BLOD response, in three visual areas (V1-V3), as a function of visual retintotopic areas and five contrast levels (96%, 48%, 24%, 12% and 6%). Each visual area was identified in each subject using a combination of retinotopic mapping methods and cortical flattening techniques. A checkerboard patterns with five level contrasts were used as the stimuli in this study. We also constructed BLOD responses amplitude tuning curves, averaged across subjects, for three visual areas (V1-V3) and three eccentricities (0-20°, 20-40°, 40-60°). The result indicated that the peripheral stimulation would lead to lower BLOD responses, compared with the visual areas relative to central field stimulation. The present signal change of each visual area is consistent with the known physiological properties of cells in the corresponding macaque visual areas in previous functional imaging studies. In presented study, we confirmed visual areas V3 showed more sensitivity to contrast, than V2, and than V1 in central and peri-central visual area. More importantly, we revealed the biological responses for peripheral visual areas (40-60°), which the V1-V3 had BLOD signal change only for higher contrast (96%and 48%), but no BLOD response for lower contrast (24%, 12% and 6%). ©2010 IEEE.

78650655888	Investigation on human characteristic of relationship between spatial working memory and controlled attention for education	During the process of school education, children with LD have defects both in spatial WM and controlled attention. However, research on the relation between them is few. Therefore, the study focused on investigating the relation using IOR paradigm as research method of controlled attention. Inhibition of Return (IOR) is the hysteresis phenomenon shown by the reaction of the previous note on the location. And working memory (WM) is a significant factor that affects the appearance and magnitude of IOR. Based on the previous researches, the paper studies the impact of spatial WM on multi-location IOR. The result shows that the load of spatial WM makes multi-location IOR disappeared as well as influencing maintenance and update of information of multi-location IOR. Meanwhile, it proves that spatial WM has an interactive impact on the selective attention. ©2010 IEEE.

78650665498	Functional neuroimaging studies of Chinese character and pure tone processing for language education	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to map brain activation during visual language task. As the result, educations have implications for other cognitive ability as well as language skill. There have no data related to different during Chinese auditory word processing in literate and illiterate subject. In this study, we analyzed data based on fMRI experimental to examine the effects of education on brain activation associated with language and control tasks in 26 healthy right-handed Chinese subjects (13 literates and 13 illiterates).There were 36 pairs of Chinese auditory word in the language task and 36 pairs of pure tone in the control task. When we compared literate and illiterate subjects, we observed education-related differences in activation patterns. As the result, we discovered bilateral different brain activations in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus (BA6), the right middle occipital gyrus (BA32), the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA47), the right middle temporal gyrus (BA21), the right superior temporal gyrus (BA22), the bilateral middle frontal gyrus (BA9) and cerebellum. Conclusion that education have implications for other cognitive ability as well as language processing, literate might respond in these task more accuracy and quickly than illiterate. ©2010 IEEE.

78650667613	Measurement and analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) on audiovisual interaction for early clinical detection of neuropsychological disorder	The clinical diagnosis can detect the presence of brain disease once significant neuronal disruption has occurred. Early clinical detection of neuropsychological disorder lacks the unification standards. The aim of this study was to describe the neural mechanism of audiovisual interaction in healthy subjects by combining behavior-based methods (neuropsychological testing) and event-related potentials (ERP), and to provide a neural mechanism for early clinical detection. We designed the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between sound and visual (-400 ms, -150 ms, 0 ms, 150 ms, 400 ms, visual only and sound only, each with equal probability, randomly in each trial), so that the subject could not find the cognitive rules connecting the two stimuli. The behavioral results showed that the responses to temporal congruency audiovisual (AV) stimuli were faster than those to unimodal visual(V) stimuli. The ERPs results showed audiovisual interaction elicited by irrelevant auditory(A) stimuli in a visual attention task. This interaction occurred at late stage around 220-240ms and 340-380ms. ©2010 IEEE.

78651226776	Multisensory interaction of audiovisual stimuli on the central and peripheral spatial locations: A behavioral study	Much knowledge has been gained about how the brain is activated on audiovisual interaction. However, few data was acquired about the relationship between audiovisual interaction and spatial locations of audiovisual stimuli. Here, we investigated the multisensory interaction of audiovisual stimuli presented on central and peripheral spatial locations. Firstly, we determined the maximal eccentricity of peripheral spatial location on where stimuli were presented which was 30°. Second, the results of audiovisual interaction showed that the interaction of visual and auditory can have dramatic effects on human perception and performance. Moreover, this effect depended on the spatial locations of presented audiovisual stimuli. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

78651252975	Correlated size variations measured in human visual cortex V1/V2/V3 with functional MRI	The retinotopic characteristics on human peripheral vision are still not well known. The position, surface area and visual field representation of human visual areas V1, V2 and V3 were measured using fMRI in 8 subjects (16 hemispheres). Cortical visual field maps of the 120deg were measured using rotating wedge and expanding ring stimuli. The boundaries between areas were identified using an automated procedure to fit an atlas of the expected visual field map to the data. All position and surface area measurements were made along the boundary between white matter and gray matter. In this study, we developed a new visual presentation system widest view (60 deg of eccentricity). The wide-view visual presentation system was made from nonmagnetic optical fibers and a contact lens, so can use in general clinical fMRI condition and the cost is lower. We used the newly wide view visual presentation system, the representation of the visual field in areas V1, V2 and V3 spans about 2223 mm∧2,1679 mm∧2 and 1690 mm∧2. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79551518920	Development of a wide-view visual presentation system for visual retinotopic mapping during functional MRI	Purpose To develop and validate the functionality of a novel wide-view visual presentation system with a horizontal and vertical eccentricity angle of 60° for retinotopic mapping by functional MRI (fMRI). Materials and Methods The wide-view presentation system consisted of a 52-mm diameter optical fiber, an entrance apparatus and a presentation apparatus. The terminal edge of the optical fiber at the entrance is flat, while the terminal edge on the presentation apparatus is a sphere of 60 mm in diameter. The subjects wore contact lenses with +20, +22, or +25 magnification to focus on the stimulus, and the visual field eccentricity angle could reach 60°. The signal to noise ratio valuation experiment was performed to evaluate the clarity and quality of the MRI picture image. Checkerboard and random dot stimuli were used to prove that this system could be applied to retinotopic mapping by fMRI. Results The results of the experiment demonstrated that the system is safe in the MRI environment with minimal distortion and can be used for visual retinotopic mapping studies. Wide-field mapping areas (V6, MST) were found in the human visual cortex. Compared with previous studies, the V1 and MT+ surface area approaches but does not fully cover the anatomical area. Nonetheless, the area achieved using the new system is larger than those achievable in previous fMRI studies. Conclusion We developed a versatile, low-cost system for presenting wide-view visual stimuli in the MRI environment. The fMRI retinotopic mapping results proved the viability of this system.

79952942718	A basic study of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) on human audiovisual spatial integration for human-machine interface	The technology of Human Machine Interface (HMI) mainly investigate about how to use machines in a more humanized way so that the communication between human and the machine could become more harmonic and natural. Previous studies indicate that there is an integration area in the human brain for audiovisual information processing. Although machines also possess mechanism for audiovisual processing, there is shortage of audiovisual information integration. And to solve this issue, the prerequisite is to make clear what kinds of cognitive processing characteristics do humans have. In this current Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) study, we adopted a left-and-right-separated sensory modality method to investigate the characteristics of human audiovisual information processing. The results showed that the main audiovisual interactions were found in frontal-central scalp sites around 80-100ms during the early stage and 280-300ms during the later stage of processing. This study provides foundation for understanding the information processing characteristic of human cognitive system and for the future machine humanization. © 2010 IEEE.

79959925222	Retinotopy mapping for Face Stimuli and Attention in the fusiform face area	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used for over a decade to study early cortical retinotopic maps in the peripheral visual areas in the human brain. However, few data were about the higher visual area, especially the object selected activation area. Novel mapping stimuli composed of face figures were used to study the extent and layout of multiple retinotopic regions in the fusiform face area and to examine the independent manipulation of retinotopic responses by stimuli of face and by attention of face. In the face defining task, a region of the fusiform face area (FFA) was exhibited face activated. Similar as the in the peripheral visual areas, FFA aslo had retinotopic esponsive to face stimuli and attention. The present results show that the attention+stimuli task, stimuli task, and attention task, the FFA has significant activities for the both left and right filed face wedge. The FFA both also had a phase change along the Fusiform gyrus, especial in the attention+stimuli task, stimuli task. This result reflected the topographic character derived by attention and stimuli. Moreover, the perception is modulated by attention. © 2011 IEEE.

79959956392	Task-irrelevant auditory stimuli affect audiovisual integration in a visual attention task: Evidence from event-related potentials	Integration of information from multiple senses is fundamental to perception and cognition, but the neural activity of multimodal audiovisual integration remains unclear. This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to demonstrate that onset synchronous task-irrelevant auditory stimuli affect the audiovisual integration. The behavioral results showed that the responses to audiovisual target stimuli were faster than that to unimodal visual target stimuli. Moreover, the ERPs were recorded in response to unimodal auditory (A), unimodal visual (V) and bimodal (AV) stimuli. Cross-modal interactions were estimated using the additive [AV - (A + V)] model. Four ERP components related to audiovisual integration were observed: (1) over central and occipital areas at around100 to 160ms; (2) over the central and occipital areas at around 160 to 200ms; (3) over the occipital areas at around 200 to 240ms. (4) over frontal-central areas at around 280 to 320ms. These findings confirmed the main neural activity of audiovisual integration. In addition, our study provided evidence that multimodal integration can be generated even if the auditory stimulus was task- irrelevant. © 2011 IEEE.

79959975109	The different effects of visual attention and auditory attention on bisensory audiovisual integration	Two experiments were conducted to explore the different effects of visual/auditory attention on bisensory audiovisual integration using behavioral and electrophysiological measures. Subjects were asked to attend visual stimulus in experiment1, but to attend auditory stimulus in experiment2. In each experiment, unisensory visual, unisensory auditory, and bisensory audiovisual stimuli were presented randomly with equal probability. The subjects were instructed to press a button in response to an infrequent target stimulus (20%) in the attend-designated modality. The behavioral results showed that the responses to audiovisual target stimuli were faster and more accurate than unisensory visual/auditory target stimuli no matter in experiment1 or in experiment2. These findings suggested that when presented simultaneously, visual and auditory stimuli interact to facilitate the behavioral response. The event-related potentials (ERPs) to bisensory stimuli (AV) were compared with the sum of the ERPs to unisensory auditory (A) and visual (V) stimuli. The bisensory audiovisual integration process was expressed as the difference waveform between AV and (A+V). In experiment1, three ERP components related to audiovisual integration were identified: (1) over the right temporal area, around 200-220 ms; (2) over the centro-medial area, around 290-310 ms; and (3) over the left and right ventral temporal area, around 290-310 ms. In experiment2, Two ERP components related to audiovisual integration were identified: (1) over the centro-medial area at 280-300 ms; and (2) over the right fronto-temporal area at 300-320 ms. Our results suggested that attention affects the process of the bisensory audiovisual integration. © 2011 IEEE.

79959987816	Attention influence response in the human visual area V1 for Ebbinghaus illusion	Early visual areas encode visual information in retinotopic coordinates, signaling retinotopic size and orientation properties. One of the most fundamental properties of human primary visual cortex (V1) is its retinotopic organization, whichmakes it an ideal candidate for encoding spatial properties, such as size, of objects. However, Ebbinghaus contextual information can lead to size illusions that are reflected in the spatial pattern of activity in V1. Here we used fMRI to measure BOLD response to a variant of the Ebbinghaus illusion to test where visual information processing starts to encode relative, opposed to retinotopic, sizes. The stimulus consisted of a white test disk on a black background display whose fixation attention, central attention or illusion than the test disk. We chose this same kind of the Ebbinghaus illusion to measure BOLD response differences due to changes in the attention. Psychophysical comparison with the traditional Ebbinghaus illusion showed that the strength of the illusion in our variant was comparable. Comparison of BOLD response across conditions (lager inducers vs. small inducers) revealed illusion related activity in the intraoccipital sulcus (IOS), the middle temporal gyrus and the temporal pole. The IOS and the posterior middle temporal activation may relate to attention position that the Ebbinghaus illusion is related to textural attention. The temporal pole activation may relate to categorical object processing. Our result is consistent with the notion that the Ebbinghaus illusion results from attention influence. This effect was significantly reduced when the focus of spatial attention was narrowed with a demanding fixation and central attention task. We reason that focusing attention on the fixation task resulted in reduced activity in. and therefore reduced feedback from higher visual areas that process the Ebbinghaus illusion. © 2011 IEEE.

79959993898	Audiovisual integration elicited by stimuli peripherally in divided attention task: An event-related potential study	To investigate the neural mechanisms of audiovisual integration in divided attention, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during a divided attention task, in which the stimulus was presented in the auditory (A), visual (V), and in the audiovisual (AV) modalities. ERPs were recorded in normal young subjects, and ERPs elicited by the auditory and visual stimuli when presented alone were summed ('sum' ERP) and compared to the ERP elicited when they were presented simultaneously ('simultaneous' ERP). Two tones (20% white noise and 80% frequent 1000 Hz) and two visual stimuli (20% red white block and 80% black white block) were delivered. Behavioral data and ERPs of AV and (A + V) were analyzed according to different location. Reaction times (RTs) to the stimuli when presented simultaneously were significantly faster than when they were presented alone. Audiovisual integration elicited by stimuli peripherally, which was followed by three more phases of effects that were marked by scalp distribution: (1) the right fronto-central area at 200-220ms after the presentation of the stimulus, (2) centro-medial area at 260-320ms after the presentation of the stimulus, and (3) right posterior area at 340-440ms. We found that these interaction effects occurred slightly later than those reported in previously published AV interaction studies in which AV stimuli were presented centrally. © 2011 IEEE.

79960005006	Development and evaluation of a MRI-compatible tactile orientation stimulator	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most recently developed forms of neuroimaging, uses MRI to measure the haemodynamic response related to neural activity. In the present study, we developed a tactile orientation stimulator using under high magnetic environment. The device is MRI-compatible and can serve to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms of tactile orientation cognition and discrimination. The primary components of the tactile orientation presentation system include a computer (system control), seven tactile orientation domes, two ultrasonic motors (tactile stimuli presentation), a motor controller and a reaction key. We evaluated the function, precision and performance of the system in a magnetic field. The results showed that the device performance is unaffected by the magnetic field, nor does the device interfere with the magnetic field, making it usable with fMRI. Furthermore, a simple button press fMRI experiment was conducted using the system. Compared to the baseline, the most prominent activation areas evoked by the button press task were in the primary motor area on the right precentral gyrus, bilateral medial frontal gyrus, putamen and cerebellum. In summary, these results indicated that the brain activation can be reliably detected with the present device. © 2011 IEEE.

While previous studies have compared performance between alphabetic and Chinese subjects, few data were about Japanese-speaking individuals. In this study, we used fMRI to investigate brain activations in processing Japanese phonological and orthographic by visual tasks in six Japanese subjects. Different activation patterns were observed between phonological and orthographic processing. We conclude that constellation of neural substrates was different for phonological processing. © 2011 IEEE.

80052793459	Effects of reaction time on the kinetic visual field	Kinetic visual field refers to the visual range in which a moving target can be seen. The reaction time in traditional Kinetic Perimetry was the time from the target was identified to the subject responded, without taking into account individual simple reaction time (SRT). This is problematic in that it mixes the evaluations of human visual performance with behavior performance. We redefined kinetic visual field by analyzed the components of the RT, and then measured SRT and kinetic visual field of six normal subjects, using a modified Goldman kinetic perimeter. The results showed that the newly defined kinetic visual field was wider than traditional defined, because the newly defined kinetic visual field without including SRT. Thus, Kinetic Perimetry using the newly defined method eliminates individual SRT differences to produce what we believe to be a more accurate evaluation indicator of human visual functions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

Some previous studies showed that the ERPs components elicited by audiovisual integration existed in the nonspecific cortices as well as specific visual and auditory cortex. It was widely considered that there weren't significant difference in ERPs of multi-sensory interaction on the left and right. In this study, we compared the integration which elicited by left and right stimuli. The significant differences were found between left and right, which were supported by the following results: (1)There are significant difference between left and right visual and auditory stimuli in early integration. There was integration effect in front area around 100-120ms when visual and auditory stimuli appeared in the right. But there was none in the left. (2)There are also siginificant differece between left and right visual and auditory stimuli in late integration. It showed difference in left and right audiovisual integration in front area and top head. Furthermore, it indicated that the processing of multi-sensory information was different between left and right brain. © 2011 IEEE.

84855651034	Different roles of the posterior inferior frontal gyrus in Chinese character form judgment differences between literate and illiterate individuals	In the present study, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the different roles of the posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG) in Chinese character form judgment between literate and illiterate subjects. Using event-related fMRI, 24 healthy right-handed Chinese subjects (12 literates and 12 illiterates) were asked to perform Chinese character and figure form judgment tasks. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) differences in pIFG were examined with general linear modeling (GLM). We found differences in reaction times and accuracy between subjects as they performed these tasks. These behavioral differences reflect the different cognitive demands of character form judgment for literate and illiterate individuals. The results showed differences in the BOLD response patterns in the pIFG between the two discrimination tasks and the two subject groups. A comparison of the character and figure tasks showed that literate and illiterate subjects had similar BOLD responses in the inferior frontal gyrus. However, differences in behavioral performance suggest that the pIFG plays a different role in Chinese character form judgment for each subject group. In literate subjects, the left pIFG mediated access to phonology in achieving Chinese character form judgment, whereas the right pIFG participated in the processing of the orthography of Chinese characters. In illiterate subjects, the bilateral frontal gyrus participated in the visual-spatial processing of Chinese characters to achieve form judgment. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All Rights Reserved.

84860120954	Spatial attention improve human performance of pointing movement	Visual attention is crucial for selecting relevant information for visual perception and actions. The aim of present study was to investigate the effects of visual spatial attention cue on performance of pointing movements, and to determine whether Fitts' law was applicable to pointing movements under different cued conditions. Ten healthy subjects were performed two pointing movement tasks with different uncued and spatial cueing conditions. The circular targets with seven kinds of different size were presented to upper, down, right, and left on the monitor randomly. The symbolic central cue consisting of a diamond was used to instruct "where" target stimuli would appeared. The findings of present study suggested the visual attention cues improved performance of pointing movement. In addition, the pointing movements were following to Fitts's law, even under different visual cueing conditions. Lastly, the location and size of target affect the pointing movement performance significantly. © 2011 International Information Institute.

84860127623	Different activities on chinese character and figure processing by a Visual fMRI study involving literates and illiterates	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) proved different brain activation patterns in processing Chinese and alphabetic languages. Previous studies that have compared performance between alphabetic literate and illiterate subjects, indicate that the literates surpass die illiterates especially in tasks involving phonological processing and that different activation regions in fMRI locate between Broca's area and the inferior parietal cortex as well as the posteriormidinsula bridge between Wernicke's and Broca's area. Few such studies were about Chinese-speaking individuals except one which showed different activation patterns between Chinese illiterates and literates in silent word recognition task (the left inferior/middle frontal gyrus and bilateral superior temporal gyri) and in silent picture-naming task (the bilateral inferior/middle fontal gyri and left limbic cingulated gyrus). However, sheer residual activations after direct comparison of literates to illiterates through different tasks remain to be further clarified. In this study, we used fMRI to examine the comparative difference of brain activations by simple visual character and figure tasks in 26 healthy right-handed Chinese subjects (13 illiterates and 13 literates). After comparison of the literate group to the illiterate, we observed: different activation regions in the Chinese character discrimination task involve the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (BA39/40), the left middle frontal gyrus (BA9/10), the left middle temporal gyrus (BA20), the bilateral middle temporal gyrus (BA21), the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (BA22), dorsal posterior cingualte (BA23/31) and cerebellum; in the simple figure discrimination task, different activations occur in the left percuneus (BA7), the bilateral superior gyrus (BA39), the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA44), the left middle temporal gyrus (BA21), the left middle occipital gyrus (BA19), the left superior longitudinal fascicule (BA4), dorsal posterior cingualte (BA23/31) and cerebellum. We conclude that literates, compared to illiterates, have intenser activations when discriminating Chinese characters and figures by a visual input modality. © 2011 International Information Institute.

In this study, as we reveal the fundamental mechanism of human memory and specify the neuronal substrates of human memory system, we conducted the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment using word priming. We first conducted the behavioral experiments of the priming test, in which the response time and the percentage of correct answer were measured. And then, we investigate the neuronal substrate for word priming using fMRI. Our results would provide a better understanding of human memory systems. We investigated changes in the behavioral performance and brain activities associated with word priming in a Word Stem Completion (WSC) task in Japanese. In the behavioral results, we found obvious facilitatory effects in subject's performance. The percentage of correct answers in word non priming (P/N) condition was 94%, while die percentage of correct answers in word priming P/Y-condition was 100%. Averaged reaction time in word P/N-condition was 150 lms, while that of word P/Y-condition was 978ms, And 3106ms in non word P/Y-condition respectively. In the fMRI, experiment, the same tasks were performed by the block-design experimental paradigm without any overt response in MRI scanner. As the fMRI results, we found the activations in the bilateral middle and inferior frontal gyrus with right hemispheric prevalence, the superior and inferior parietal gyrus, and the supplementary motor area. The prefrontal-parietal network observed in our study is consistent with the activated areas in word stem task in English. These results suggested that the facilitatory effects observed in WSC-test include implicit memory access and the induced attention after successful retrieval. In the fMRI experiment, the same tasks were performed by the block-design experimental paradigm without any overt response in MRI scanner. As the fMRI results, we found the activations in the bilateral middle and inferior frontal gyrus with right hemispheric prevalence, the superior and inferior parietal gyrus, and the supplementary motor area. The prefrontal-parietal network observed in our study is consistent with the activated areas in word stem task in English.

84860201725	The contribution of pinna cues to human sound discriminate ability of vertical angle in sagittal planes	We tested the ability of human listeners to discriminate white noise bursts in the absence of binaural discrimination cues and changed the shape of spectral cues. Minimum audible angle (MAA) thresholds were determined for twelve subjects in a two-alternative, forced-choice, adaptive paradigm (2AFC) as a function of the orientation of the array of sound sources in the vertical plane (elevation). The subjects were students with normal hearing who wore a monaural earplug to reduce sound level and timing cues and were then fitted with two kinds of pinna mold to change the shape of spectral cues. Tests measured discrimination of the vertical angle in eight planes parallel to the median plane (0° position). The results showed that the sound source position could be discriminated in the vertical plane when a subject with normal monaural hearing wore the external ear model. However, the discrimination ability worsened remarkably. The ability to discriminate the orientation of sound sources in the under hemi-field was greater than in the upper hemi-field at the 0° to 180° (Near) reference positions, while the reverse was true for the 225° to 315° (Far) reference positions. In addition, the pinna cavities of both the near and far ears play a role in determining the perceived vertical angle of a sound source in any horizontal position, including the median plane. As a sound source shifts laterally away from the median plane, the contribution of the near ear increases, while that of the far ear decreases. For horizontal positions at azimuths greater than 180° from the midline, the far ear mold no longer changes the shape of spectral cues for discriminating the vertical angle. © 2011 International Information Institute.

84862825875	Retinotopic mapping of the peripheral visual field to human visual cortex by functional magnetic resonance imaging	Retinotopic mapping is a key property of organization in the human occipital cortex. The retinotopic organization of the central visual field of visual areas V1, V2, and V3 has been well established. We used fMRI to measure the retinotopic map of the peripheral visual field (eccentricity up to 60°). We estimated the sizes of the visual areas between 0° and 60° and obtained results consistent with anatomical studies. We also estimated the cortical distances and magnification factors for reconstruction of the retinotopic map using the peripheral wedge dipole model. By comparing the retinotopic map with the flattened surface, we analyzed the datasets used to reconstruct the map. We found that: (1) the percentage of the striate cortex devoted to peripheral vision in humans is significantly larger than that in the macaque, (2) the estimate of the scaling factor in linear magnification is larger than that found in previous studies focusing on central vision, and (3) the estimate of the peripheral factor in the dipolar model is too large to make the curve direction of the dipolar map in the periphery equivalent to that in the center. On the basis of our results, we revised the dipolar map to fit our conditions. The revised map in humans has a similar elliptical shape to that of macaques, and the central parts of the two species are the same. The different parts of the map are the peripheral regions, for which the peripheral wedge dipole model in humans is reversed compared to that of macaques. ©; 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84867544589	Delayed audiovisual integration of patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease compared with normal aged controls	The human brain can anatomically combine task-relevant information from different sensory pathways to form a unified perception; this process is called multisensory integration. The aim of the present study was to test whether the multisensory integration abilities of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) differed from those of normal aged controls (NC). A total of 64 subjects were divided into three groups: NC individuals (n = 24), MCI patients (n = 19), and probable AD patients (n = 21). All of the subjects were asked to perform three separate audiovisual integration tasks and were instructed to press the response key associated with the auditory, visual, or audiovisual stimuli in the three tasks. The accuracy and response time (RT) of each task were measured, and the RTs were analyzed using cumulative distribution functions to observe the audiovisual integration. Our results suggest that the mean RT of patients with AD was significantly longer than those of patients with MCI and NC individuals. Interestingly, we found that patients with both MCI and AD exhibited adequate audiovisual integration, and a greater peak (time bin with the highest percentage of benefit) and broader temporal window (time duration of benefit) of multisensory enhancement were observed. However, the onset time and peak benefit of audiovisual integration in MCI and AD patients occurred significantly later than did those of the NC. This finding indicates that the cognitive functional deficits of patients with MCI and AD contribute to the differences in performance enhancements of audiovisual integration compared with NC. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

84867606656	Inhibition of tactile information on visual spatial attention: An fMRI study	Visual orienting attention is well researched by using a visual cue. But in the tactile orienting of the visual, Due to technical reasons, the explanations of the tactile information effect of visual attention is no clear, and just have few research to devoted to this part. Visual cue in the top-down attention mechanism was investigated that it could effectively improve the target cognition reaction quality. Recent brain studies showed that the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) played an important role to keep the task-relevant information and task rule during tasks. In our study, We used a top-down attention paradigm in which a visual cue directs the attention of participants to both visual and tactile target stimulus in a spatial (attention was directed to unilateral target distinctly) in visual spatial attention task and tactile-visual spatial attention task. And the attention was manipulated to visual spatial orienting by a visual cue, tactile target stimulus was told to be ignored. Subjects were also scanned during a resting baseline condition in which subjects clicked the reaction key ten times. The reaction time for spatial location attention is faster than that with the tactile stimulus. Behavioral results of reaction time no have any significant difference between the two tasks. But the RTs of the VS task is faster than VtS task. So we thought that the tactile information may affecting the visual spatial attention neural network. Brain-imaging data showed that IPL (inferior parietal lobe) and MFG (middle frontal gyrus) were activated in the visual spatial attention task and the activation was enhanced during the task with the tactile stimulus. © 2012 IEEE.

84867634901	The effect of spatial information of auditory stimuli on audiovisual interaction: Evidence from event-related potentials	Converging evidence indicates that spatial information of stimuli plays an important role in multisensory interaction. The spatial characteristics of auditory stimuli tended to be biased toward the spatial characteristics of visual stimuli. However, when and where the multimodal audiovisual interaction is affected by the spatial characteristics of auditory stimuli remains unclear. This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to demonstrate that the auditory stimuli come from 0°, 90°, 180° or 270° location affect the audiovisual interaction. The behavioral results showed that the responses to audiovisual target stimuli were faster than that to unimodal visual target stimuli. Moreover, the ERPs were recorded in response to unimodal auditory (A), unimodal visual (V) and bimodal (AV) stimuli. Cross-modal interactions were estimated using the additive [AV - A] model. At 0° location, four ERP components related to audiovisual interaction were observed: (1) Central and occipital effect was observed at around80 to 160ms; (2) over the central and occipital areas at around 160 to 200ms; (3) over the occipital areas at around 200 to 260ms. (4) Central and occipital areas after 350ms. These findings confirmed the main neural activity of audiovisual interaction. In addition, our study provided evidence that multimodal interaction can be generated even if the auditory stimuli come from different spatial locations. © 2012 IEEE.

84867635990	Using multi-voxel pattern analysis of fMRI data to decoding human visual cortex activations	The potential for human neuroimaging to read-out the detailed contents of a person's mental state has yet to be fully explored. For fMRI decoding, it is important to choose an appropriate set of voxels (or features) as inputs to the decoder, since the presence of many irrelevant voxels could lead to poor generalization performance, a problem known as overfitting. We applied ARD-based sparse Bayesian algorithm to solve overfitting in fMRI classification. The simulated data demonstrated that sparse logistic regression can select effective features through the weight parameters for each class, and most of the selected features lied in the class they belong to. We observed that sparse logistic regression over pruned some effective features under the condition of 80 features, yet it had limited negative impact on the performance of prediction. The reason is perhaps that these over pruned features have similar values for all classes. On the other hand, it indicated that the selected features contained enough information for classification. Another interesting result is that as more irrelevant features were added to the training set, the performance of C-SVM dropped sharply. This demonstrated that sparse logistic regression can outperform C-SVM when irrelevant features are far more than relevant ones. Despite sparse sparse logistic regression wrongly selected some effective features, it had very limited impact on the prediction performance using both correct and wrong features. © 2012 IEEE.

84867639139	Neural correlates of tactile orientation discrimination: An fMRI study	In the present study, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we measured the tactile memory related brain activations with tactile orientation discrimination task. For each trial, two of three tactile grating domes with same or different orientations (0, 45 and 90° against the proximal-distal line of right index finger) were presented to the subjects' right index fingertip. Nine health young subjects were asked to discriminate whether the orientations of two tactile stimuli was the same or not. Compared to the resting period, the most prominent activation areas evoked by the orientation discrimination tasks were in the primary and secondary somatosensory areas in the bilateral parietal operculum (SI and SII), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), supplementary motor area (SMA), lateral occipital complex (LOC), insula and cerebellum. But we found that both of the activation in intensity and size were higher during tactile orientation discrimination process compared to these of encoding process. The result suggested that the tactile orientation discrimination process may raise more brain activations since this process include the high level processing such as recall and decision making. © 2012 IEEE.

84867640441	Differential activity of semantic and font size judgment processing of Japanese word: An fMRI study	Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), much knowledge has been gained in understanding how the brain is activated during controlled experiments of language tasks in alphabetic subjects and in logographic language subjects. While previous studies have compared performance between alphabetic and Chinese subjects, few data were about Japanese-speaking individuals. In this study, we used fMRI to investigate brain activations in processing Japanese semantic and font size judgment by visual tasks in six Japanese subjects. Different activation patterns were observed between semantic and font size judgment processing. We conclude that constellation of neural substrates was different for semantic processing. © 2012 IEEE.

84867647478	Development and evaluation of a tactile speed stimulator for MRI environment	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), one of the most popular forms of neuroimaging, uses MRI to measure the hemodynamic response related to neural activity. In the present study, we developed a tactile speed stimulator for fMRI environment. The device is MRI-compatible and can serve to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms of tactile speed discrimination. The primary components of the tactile speed stimulator system include a computer, two drums with dots, a motor controller and a reaction key. We evaluated the function, precision and performance of the system in a magnetic field. The results showed that the device performance is unaffected by the magnetic field, nor does the device interfere with the magnetic field, making it usable with fMRI. Furthermore, a simple pressing button in fMRI experiment was conducted using the system. Compared to the baseline, the most prominent activation areas evoked by the button press task were in the lobulus parietalis inferior, gyrus postcentralis, gyrus frontalis inferior and gyrus precentralis.In conclusion, these results indicated that the brain activation can be reliably detected with the present device. © 2012 IEEE.

84867658560	Effects of spatial location on bisensory audiovisual integration in horizontal meridian	Crossmodal spatial integration between auditory and visual stimuli is a common phenomenon in space perception. In the present study, the effects of spatial location on bisensory audiovisual integration in horizontal meridian were investigated. The behavior results of audiovisual integration were compared at -30°, 0° and 30° on horizontal direction. Our results showed that responses to audiovisual stimuli presented at a center location (0°) were faster and more accurate than those presented at peripheral locations (±30°). The results suggest that bimodal audiovisual integration depends on the spatial location of audiovisual stimuli. © 2012 IEEE.

84867661014	Effect of cue-target interval on endogenous attention in Go/No-Go task: Evidence from an event-related potentials study	Previous researches found that inter stimulus interval (ISI) affected the amplitude and latency of P300 component in go/no-go task or oddball paradigm. Here we combined the cue-target paradigm with go/no-go task to investigate whether the cue-target interval (the time between cue-offset and target-onset) could affect the amplitude or latency of P300 component or not, when the central cue could completely predicts the target location, which induced totally endogenous attention. The results showed that the latency of P300 would not change in short (600ms) or long (1800ms) cue-target intervals conditions, indicating the endogenous attention worked on the target processing so that effect of different intervals on target processing was not significant. However, the mean amplitude of P300 (from 300ms to 600ms, after target onset) increased with the increasing cue-target interval, which supported that the temporal factor that was either target-target interval or cue-target interval, might determine the amplitude of P300. © 2012 IEEE.

84868653014	Prominent activation of the intraparietal and somatosensory areas during angle discrimination by intra-active touch	Intra-active touch (IAT) is a process that involves a body part doing the touching (active touch [AT]) and another body part being touched (passive touch [PT]) simultaneously. The brain representation related to IAT is still unclear. A total of 23 subjects carried out angle discrimination under PT, AT and IAT conditions with functional magnetic resonance imaging. All of the tasks were strictly dependent on cutaneous feedback from the finger(s). As the subjects were able to perceive the angle stimuli from the right (touching) and left (touched) sides during the IAT condition, we expected there would be greater brain activation with the IAT condition than for the AT or PT condition. Therefore, we hypothesized that the region within and/or around the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the part of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) that is associated with high-level tactile spatial processing would be more active during the IAT task than during the AT and PT tasks. Compared with the areas activated by the motor somatosensory control task, the most prominent activation areas evoked by the three-angle discrimination tasks were in the SI and secondary somatosensory cortex areas in the bilateral parietal operculum, IPS, lateral occipital complex, insula and cerebellum. Finally, we directly compared IAT with AT and PT, and the results suggest that the contralateral part of IPS and part of the SI are more active under IAT conditions than under either AT or PT conditions. These results suggest that both hemispheres contribute to angle discrimination during IAT. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84869217576	An fMRI Study of the Neural Systems Involved in Visually Cued Auditory Top-Down Spatial and Temporal Attention	Top-down attention to spatial and temporal cues has been thoroughly studied in the visual domain. However, because the neural systems that are important for auditory top-down temporal attention (i.e., attention based on time interval cues) remain undefined, the differences in brain activity between directed attention to auditory spatial location (compared with time intervals) are unclear. Using fMRI (magnetic resonance imaging), we measured the activations caused by cue-target paradigms by inducing the visual cueing of attention to an auditory target within a spatial or temporal domain. Imaging results showed that the dorsal frontoparietal network (dFPN), which consists of the bilateral intraparietal sulcus and the frontal eye field, responded to spatial orienting of attention, but activity was absent in the bilateral frontal eye field (FEF) during temporal orienting of attention. Furthermore, the fMRI results indicated that activity in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) was significantly stronger during spatial orienting of attention than during temporal orienting of attention, while the DLPFC showed no significant differences between the two processes. We conclude that the bilateral dFPN and the right VLPFC contribute to auditory spatial orienting of attention. Furthermore, specific activations related to temporal cognition were confirmed within the superior occipital gyrus, tegmentum, motor area, thalamus and putamen. © 2012 Li et al.

84873340423	Enhancement of visual detection by temporal alignment of visual-auditory stimuli: A behavioral and event-related potential study	Many studies have shown that temporal asynchrony of visual-auditory stimuli can influence the interaction between visual and auditory stimulus, however, the multisensory mechanisms of asynchrony inputs were not well understood. In this study, the visual and auditory stimuli onset asynchrony (SOA= ±400 ms, ±150 ms, 0 ms), only the visual stimulus was attended. Behavioral data and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) were recorded. We found that when the SOA was -150ms, the reaction time was the fastest and hit rate was the highest, and the N1 latency of biomodal AV was earlier than the sum of unimodal A and unimodal V in auditory preceding condition. ©2013 International Information Institute.

84874425352	Development of a method to present wide-view visual stimuli in MRI for peripheral visual studies	We developed a novel wide-view visual presentation system for fMRI studies. Computer-generated images were projected onto a hemispheric, translucent screen inside the MRI bore and were then back-projected onto a 52. mm diameter screen. To achieve a wide field view, a spherical screen with a curvature radius of 30. mm was placed 30. mm away from the subjects' eyes. The subjects wore contact lenses that enabled them to focus on the screen, and the resulting visual field reached 120°. To evaluate the clarity and quality of the MRI images, a signal-to-noise ratio valuation experiment was performed. In addition, we successfully applied this visual presentation system to studies of visual retinotopic mapping and object perception neural function in the peripheral visual field. Our study demonstrated that the system is compatible with the MRI environment. Based on the wide-field mapping results, this system was more effective at mapping a checkerboard stimuli in V1-V3 from the central to peripheral visual fields. In higher-level visual areas, we successfully located several classical category-selective areas, including the face-selective area (FFA), occipital face area (OFA), house-selective area (PPA), transverse occipital sulcus (TOS), lateral occipital complex (LOC) and posterior fusiform area (pFs). In these areas, we found that the response amplitudes exhibited different decreasing trends with increasing eccentricity. In conclusion, we developed a simple, effective method for presenting wide-view visual stimuli within the MRI environment that can be applied to many kinds of fMRI studies of peripheral vision. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84874425494	Aging-related changes of the kinetic visual field	Study of the kinetic visual field of humans and the effect of aging upon it is strongly needed in order to identify the cause of traffic accidents while focusing on these characteristics. In this paper, differences in the kinetic visual field between younger and older people were measured and analyzed after identifying problems with the conventional definition of the kinetic visual field and modifying the kinetic perimeter system. In addition, by measuring simple reaction time when the kinetic visual field is measured in order to minimize the effect of individual differences in response time, it was confirmed that older people are greatly affected by deteriorating visual performance caused by aging, particularly in upward visual field rather than downward visual fields in all target conditions. Visual field angle reductions in the temple sides of upward visual fields were of particular note. © 2012 IEEE.

84874786340	Prominent activation of the bilateral inferior parietal lobule of literate compared with illiterate subjects during Chinese logographic processing	Chinese is a logographic language system that differs from alphabetic languages, and some of the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying Chinese logographic reading also differ from those underlying alphabetic word reading. However, whether education level effects the neural activation associated with logographic processing of Chinese is still unknown. In the present study, 11 Chinese illiterate and 11 literate (age-matched) subjects participated in an event-related fMRI experiment with Chinese character discrimination (CD) and figure discrimination (FD) tasks. All subjects were asked to view the character or figure pairs and discriminate whether the characters or figures of each stimuli pair were the same or not using response keys. Both literate and illiterate subjects activated a widely distributed cerebral network, including the bilateral inferior, middle and superior frontal gyri, superior temporal gyrus and parietal lobe, in the CD task. Finally, we directly compared the activations of literate subjects with illiterate subjects. The results suggest that the bilateral parts of the angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus are more active for literate than illiterate subjects in the CD task. We found no significant group difference in the FD task. Therefore, the present results may indicate that education level effects the neural activation associated with the logographic processing of Chinese. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

84879185849	Effects of Auditory Stimuli in the Horizontal Plane on Audiovisual Integration: An Event-Related Potential Study	This article aims to investigate whether auditory stimuli in the horizontal plane, particularly originating from behind the participant, affect audiovisual integration by using behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measurements. In this study, visual stimuli were presented directly in front of the participants, auditory stimuli were presented at one location in an equidistant horizontal plane at the front (0°, the fixation point), right (90°), back (180°), or left (270°) of the participants, and audiovisual stimuli that include both visual stimuli and auditory stimuli originating from one of the four locations were simultaneously presented. These stimuli were presented randomly with equal probability; during this time, participants were asked to attend to the visual stimulus and respond promptly only to visual target stimuli (a unimodal visual target stimulus and the visual target of the audiovisual stimulus). A significant facilitation of reaction times and hit rates was obtained following audiovisual stimulation, irrespective of whether the auditory stimuli were presented in the front or back of the participant. However, no significant interactions were found between visual stimuli and auditory stimuli from the right or left. Two main ERP components related to audiovisual integration were found: first, auditory stimuli from the front location produced an ERP reaction over the right temporal area and right occipital area at approximately 160-200 milliseconds; second, auditory stimuli from the back produced a reaction over the parietal and occipital areas at approximately 360-400 milliseconds. Our results confirmed that audiovisual integration was also elicited, even though auditory stimuli were presented behind the participant, but no integration occurred when auditory stimuli were presented in the right or left spaces, suggesting that the human brain might be particularly sensitive to information received from behind than both sides. © 2013 Yang et al.

84881482967	Influences of auditory stimuli in front and rear space on visual detection: An event-related potential study	Although many previous studies have investigated location of modalities could affect detection to the task, whether auditory stimuli in the rear space could influence visual detection remain unclear. Therefore, we designed a visual detection task that included visual stimuli which were presented in front of the participants, auditory stimuli which were presented at one location in an equidistant horizontal plane at the front (0°, the fixation point), right (90°), rear (180°), or left (270°) of the participants, and audiovisual stimuli that both visual stimuli and auditory stimuli from one speaker of the four locations were simultaneously presented. The task of participants is to attend to the visual stimulus and respond promptly only to visual target stimuli (unimodal visual target stimulus and visual target of audiovisual stimulus). We found that auditory stimuli in both the front and rear space could enhance visual detection. Moreover, main event-related potential (ERP) components which influences of auditory stimuli on visual detection were found: (1) over the right occipital area, approximately 160-200 milliseconds, when auditory stimuli were presented in front space; (2) over the parieto-occipital area, approximately 360-400 milliseconds, when auditory stimuli were presented in both front and rear space. Our results confirmed that even though auditory stimuli were presented at rear of the subject, auditory stimuli also could influence visual cognitive in the visual detection task. © 2013 IEEE.

84881489129	Decreased brain activation along with increased interstimulus interval in the Posner task	In experimental paradigms, voluntary orienting of visual-spatial attention is conventionally achieved through the Posner task in which predictive central cues are presented to indicate the location of an upcoming peripheral target, followed by varying inter-stimulus interval (ISI). Previous studies have indicated that the effects of ISI on spatial attention can occur. However, to date, brain mechanisms associated with ISI effects remain unclear. We investigated the brain activity changes along with increased ISI. Behaviorally, subjects exhibited no difference in the different ISI conditions. However, neuroimaging data revealed reduced activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) as ISI becomes longer. We propose that, as time went on, the strength of visual-spatial bias reduced, resulting in decreased PCC activation. © 2013 IEEE.

84882595248	Regional Neural Response Differences in the Determination of Faces or Houses Positioned in a Wide Visual Field	In human visual cortex, the primary visual cortex (V1) is considered to be essential for visual information processing; the fusiform face area (FFA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA) are considered as face-selective region and places-selective region, respectively. Recently, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study showed that the neural activity ratios between V1 and FFA were constant as eccentricities increasing in central visual field. However, in wide visual field, the neural activity relationships between V1 and FFA or V1 and PPA are still unclear. In this work, using fMRI and wide-view present system, we tried to address this issue by measuring neural activities in V1, FFA and PPA for the images of faces and houses aligning in 4 eccentricities and 4 meridians. Then, we further calculated ratio relative to V1 (RRV1) as comparing the neural responses amplitudes in FFA or PPA with those in V1. We found V1, FFA, and PPA showed significant different neural activities to faces and houses in 3 dimensions of eccentricity, meridian, and region. Most importantly, the RRV1s in FFA and PPA also exhibited significant differences in 3 dimensions. In the dimension of eccentricity, both FFA and PPA showed smaller RRV1s at central position than those at peripheral positions. In meridian dimension, both FFA and PPA showed larger RRV1s at upper vertical positions than those at lower vertical positions. In the dimension of region, FFA had larger RRV1s than PPA. We proposed that these differential RRV1s indicated FFA and PPA might have different processing strategies for encoding the wide field visual information from V1. These different processing strategies might depend on the retinal position at which faces or houses are typically observed in daily life. We posited a role of experience in shaping the information processing strategies in the ventral visual cortex. © 2013 Wang et al.

84881493273	Age-related differences in pointing movements in restricted visual tasks and their design implication	The operation of the touch screen is a typical pointing movement. Because touch screens has such a wide range of applications, the users of touch screen will necessarily include people of all age groups The variation in physical and psychomotor capability between different age groups which affect touch screen performance should, therefore, be studied to facilitate the design of touch screen user interface is necessary. The goal of the study was to examine the effect of aging on pointing movements under restricted visual feedback conditions (i.e., full-vision, no feedback about hand movement, no feedback about target location, and no visual feedback of any type). In light of the fact that different age groups exhibit different kinds of movement behaviour patterns, suggestions for the design of touch screen user interface were outlined. © 2013 IEEE.

84881499732	Effect of cue-target interval on audiovisual stimuli processing in endogenous spatial attention: An event-related potentials study	Previous studies indicated that the interstimulus interval (ISI) has effects on the visual or auditory stimulus processing. Utilizing the high temporal resolution of event-related potentials (ERPs), we combined the endogenous cue-target paradigm in which the central cue could completely predicts the target location with go/no-go task to investigate whether the ISI could affect the audiovisual (AV) stimuli processing. The results showed that the ISI had effect on the AV stimuli processing. Specifically, the mean amplitude of the late positivity components (220-260 ms & 400-500 ms) was larger in the long ISI (1800 ms) condition than in the short ISI (600 ms) condition, while the late negativity component (300-340 ms) was larger in the short ISI condition than in the long ISI condition. But the ISI had no effect on early ERPs components (P1 & N1) elicited by the AV stimuli. The ERPs results suggested that the ISI can affect the AV stimuli processing reflecting on the later components, but not on the earlier ERPs components. © 2013 IEEE.

The study of audiovisual information integration can helps to reveal processing mechanism of human brain. It was very important to explore multi-sensor data fusion theory model. In the present study, we designed two experiments to investigate the effects of temporal-spatial unpredictable auditory information on temporal-spatial coincident audiovisual integration. Our results showed temporal-spatial unpredictable auditory information increased the strength of attention, and significantly improved visual detection rates. In addition, through the comparison with the results in another study we speculate that the temporal unpredictable auditory information has less of no effects on audiovisual integration. © 2013 IEEE.

Many studies show the different activation patterns of alphabetic language and logographic language. It is unclear that if bilinguals̀Ll and L2 language are all logographic language (e.g. Chinese and Japanese), whether Japanese (L2) processing is different from Chinese (Ll) for bilinguals' brain activity. To study the underlying mechanisms, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to visualize Chinese-Japanese bilinguals' brain activity in both of Chinese character and Japanese Kanji. Precuneus were activated by morphology judgment in Chinese word contrast with Japanese word. The results with Chinese and Japanese logographs suggested precuneus were played an important role in Chinese morphology processing for Chinese-Japanese bilingual speakers. © 2013 IEEE.

We investigated the BLOD response to stimuli in two regions in the ventral visual cortex, the fusiform face area (FFA), and the parahippocampal place area (PPA). The analysis further revealed the weaker BLOD response in the bigger eccentricity in both the FFA and PPA areas. Moreover, the FFA had much bigger neural activation than the PPA. However, the ratio relative to central position had no difference between face and house. Regions of the FFA had bigger neural response, and associated with central representation, compared to PPA had smaller neural response, and associated with more peripheral representation. These results suggested the neural response character in ventral visual areas influenced by inherent difference between face and house, and little by the eccentricity. © 2013 IEEE.

84881533867	Difference of audiovisual integration between Alzheimer's Disease patients and age-matched healthy controls: An fMRI study	Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common and destructive neurodegenerative disorder threatening old people. As a non-invasive way to assess brain function, the fMRI technique can be used to detect how the brain activity pattern of AD patients differ from that of age-matched elder controls (EC). We compared the brain activity pattern of AD and EC under three conditions: unimodal auditory stimuli, unimodal visual stimuli and bimodal audiovisual stimuli. It was found that patients with AD exhibit a more extensive but relatively weaker response than EC, and in every type of stimuli, the activated brain areas are dissimilar with EC. The limbic lobe of AD patients is universally silent while the hippocampal areas in EC are active. Moreover, compared with EC, AD patients show fewer activated regions for audiovisual integration, indicating impaired multisensory information processing and cognitive integration. The findings imply that fMRI can help with the diagnosis of AD even in the early stage. © 2013 IEEE.

84884396908	Modulation of auditory stimulus processing by visual spatial or temporal cue: An event-related potentials study	Utilizing the high temporal resolution of event-related potentials (ERPs), we examined how visual spatial or temporal cues modulated the auditory stimulus processing. The visual spatial cue (VSC) induces orienting of attention to spatial locations; the visual temporal cue (VTC) induces orienting of attention to temporal intervals. Participants were instructed to respond to auditory targets. Behavioral responses to auditory stimuli following VSC were faster and more accurate than those following VTC. VSC and VTC had the same effect on the auditory N1 (150-170. ms after stimulus onset). The mean amplitude of the auditory P1 (90-110. ms) in VSC condition was larger than that in VTC condition, and the mean amplitude of late positivity (300-420. ms) in VTC condition was larger than that in VSC condition. These findings suggest that modulation of auditory stimulus processing by visually induced spatial or temporal orienting of attention were different, but partially overlapping. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84886409049	Spatial location of audiovisual stimuli affects the latency of multisensory integration around 340 to 400 ms	The effects of spatial location on muhisensory audiovisual integration were investigated using behavioural and event-related potential (ERP) measurements. The behavioral results showed that responses to audiovisual stimuli presented at a center location were faster and more accurate than those presented at peripheral locations. The ERP results showed the audiovisual integration was 20 ms earlier when stimuli were presented on center location than that when stimuli were presented on left or right location at occipital area around 340 to 400 ms. Our results suggest that bimodal audiovisual integration depends on the spatial location of audiovisual stimuli. © 2013 International Information Institute.

84892932430	Development of a wide-view visual presentation system for functional MRI studies of peripheral visual	In present paper, we described a novel wide-view visual presentation system for fMRI studies. To achieve a wide field view, a translucent spherical screen with a curvature radius of 30 mm was placed 30 mm away from the subjects' eyes. The subjects wore contact lenses that enabled them to focus on the screen, and the resulting visual field reached 120°. Then, high resolution computer-generated images were projected onto the translucent hemispheric screen inside the MRI bore. Signal-to-noise ratio valuation experiment was performed to evaluate the clarity and quality of the MRI images. In addition, we successfully applied this visual presentation system to studies of visual retinotopic mapping and object perception neural function in the peripheral visual field. Our study demonstrated that the system is compatible with the MRI environment. Moreover, this system was more effective at mapping checkerboard stimuli in V1-V3, and successfully located several classical category-selective areas, including the face-selective area (FFA), occipital face area (OFA), house-selective area (PPA), transverse occipital sulcus (TOS), lateral occipital complex (LOC) in higher-level visual areas. In conclusion, the wide-view visual presentation system within the MRI environment can be applied to many kinds of fMRI studies of peripheral vision. © Springer International Publishing 2013.

84898107806	Location and functional definition of human visual motion organization using functional magnetic resonance imaging	In humans, functional imaging studies have found a homolog of the macaque motion complex, MT+, which is suggested to contain both the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas in the ascending limb of the inferior temporal sulcus. In the macaque, the motion-sensitive MT and MST areas are adjacent in the superior temporal sulcus. Electrophysiology has identified several motion-selective regions in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) of the macaque. Two of the best-studied areas include the MT and MST areas. The MT area has strong projections to the adjacent MST area and is typically subdivided into the dorsal (MSTd) and lateral (MSTl) subregions. While MT encodes the basic elements of motion, MST has higher-order motion-processing abilities and has been implicated in the perception of both object motion and self motion. The macaque MST area has been shown to have considerably larger receptive fields than the MT area. The receptive fields of MT cells typically extend only a few degrees into the ipsilateral visual field, while MST neurons have receptive fields that extend well into the ipsilateral visual field. This study tentatively identifies these subregions as the human homologs of the macaque MT and MST areas, respectively (Fig. 1). Putative human MT and MST areas were typically located on the posterior/ventral and anterior/dorsal banks of a dorsal/posterior limb of the inferior temporal sulcus. These locations are similar to their relative positions in the macaque superior temporal sulcus. © 2011, IGI Global.

84898116815	Cerebral network for implicit Chinese character processing: An fMRI study	Recent event-related fMRI studies suggest that a left-lateralized network exists for reading Chinese words (to contrast two-character Chinese words and figures). In this study, the authors used a 3T fMRI to investigate brain activation when processing characters and figures in a visual discrimination task. Thirteen Chinese individuals were shown two Chinese characters (36 pairs) or two figures (36 pairs). The control task (two figures) was used to eliminate non-linguistic visual and motor confounds. The results showed that discrimination of Chinese characters is performed by a bilateral network that processes orthographic, phonological, and semantic features. Significant activation patterns were observed in the occipital region (BA17, 18, 19, and 37), temporal region (BA22 and 38), parietal region (BA7, 39, and 40), and frontal region (BA4, 6, 10, and 46) of the brain and in the cerebellum. The study concludes that a constellation of neural substrates provides a bilateral network that processes Chinese subjects. © 2011, IGI Global.

84898142771	Effects of stimulus complexity on bisensory audiovisual integration	With the rapid increase in the number of elderly people, the number of people with dementia is also increasing. The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for 50-70% of all dementia cases. Until the present time, however, there was no effective early detection method for Alzheimer's disease. A recent study showed that brain glucose metabolism in healthy volunteers was different than glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's patients during the response to passive audiovisual stimulation. This result suggested that the mechanism of audiovisual integration in patients with Alzheimer's disease was influenced by the disease. In the present study, the authors investigated the effects of modality-specific selective attention on audiovisual integration using simple visual and auditory stimuli in healthy human subjects. Three different attentional instructions were accessed: (1) visual selective attention, in which subjects were instructed to focus their attention on visual stimuli; (2) auditory selective attention, in which subjects were instructed to focus their attention on auditory stimuli; and (3) audiovisual divided attention, in which subjects were instructed to focus their attention on both visual and auditory stimuli. The results showed that significant bimodal enhancement was present only in the divided attention condition, which is similar to the results of a previous study using complex semantic stimuli. Therefore, the authors conclude that stimulus complexity does not influence the modality-specific selective attention effects of audiovisual integration. A future study will examine the mechanism of audiovisual integration in patients with Alzheimer's disease using the same experimental design (using simple stimuli), which will hopefully help find a new method for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. © 2011, IGI Global.

84898328424	Visual attention with auditory stimulus	Visual orienting attention is best studied using visual cues. Spatial and temporal attention have been compared using brain-imaging data. This chapter's authors developed a visual orienting attention tool to compare auditory when a visual target was presented. They also designed a control task in which subjects had to click on the response key consistent with a simultaneous spatial task. The effect of clicking the response key was removed by subtracting the brain activations elicited by clicking the response key from the results of the visual voluntary attention task. The authors then measured brain activity in sixteen healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging (Coull, Frith, Büchel & Nobre, 2000). In the task, visual spatial attention was manipulated by a visual cue, and participants were told to ignore the auditory stimulus. A neutral task was also performed, in which a neutral cue was used. Symbolic central cues oriented subjects to spatial location only (Coull & Nobre, 1998) or gave no information about spatial location. Subjects were also scanned during a resting baseline condition in which they clicked the reaction key ten times. The reaction time for spatial location attention was faster than that without an auditory stimulus. Brain-imaging data showed that the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) were activated in the visual-spatial attention task and that the activation was enhanced during the task with the auditory stimulus. © 2011, IGI Global.

84899668343	Attention influence response of Ebbinghaus illusion in the human visual area	Early visual areas encode visual information in retinotopic coordinates, signaling retinotopic size and orientation properties. One of the most fundamental properties of human primary visual cortex (V1) is its retinotopic organization, which makes it an ideal candidate for encoding spatial properties, such as size, of objects. However, Ebbinghaus contextual information can lead to size illusions that are reflected in the spatial pattern of activity in V1, V2 and V3. Here we used fMRI to measure BOLD response to a variant of the Ebbinghaus illusion to test where visual information processing starts to encode relative, opposed to retinotopic, sizes. Our result is consistent with the notion drat the Ebbinghaus illusion results from attention influence. This effect was significantly reduced when the focus of spatial attention was narrowed with a demanding fixation and central attention task. We reason that focusing attention on the fixation task resulted in reduced activity in. and therefore reduced feedback from higher visual areas that process the Ebbinghaus illusion. © 2014 International Information Institute.

84902087252	Effects of ipsilateral and bilateral auditory stimuli on audiovisual integration: A behavioral and event-related potential study	We used event-related potential measures to compare the effects of ipsilateral and bilateral auditory stimuli on audiovisual (AV) integration. Behavioral results showed that the responses to visual stimuli with either type of auditory stimulus were faster than responses to visual stimuli only and that perceptual sensitivity (d′) for visual detection was enhanced for visual stimuli with ipsilateral auditory stimuli. Furthermore, event-related potential components related to AV integrations were identified over the occipital areas at ∼180-200 ms during early-stage sensory processing by the effect of ipsilateral auditory stimuli and over the frontocentral areas at ∼300-320 ms during late-stage cognitive processing by the effect of ipsilateral and bilateral auditory stimuli. Our results confirmed that AV integration was also elicited, despite the effect of bilateral auditory stimuli, and only occurred at later stages of cognitive processing in response to a visual detection task. Furthermore, integration from early-stage sensory processing was observed by the effect of ipsilateral auditory stimuli, suggesting that the integration of AV information in the human brain might be particularly sensitive to ipsilaterally presented AV stimuli.

84905010246	Contrast response functions with wide-view stimuli in the human visual cortex	In this manuscript, using a novel wide-view visual presentation system that we developed for vision research and functional magnetic resonance imaging (f MRI), we studied contrast response functions in regions of the brain that are central and peripheral to the entire set of visual areas (V1, V2, V3, V3A, MT+), regions that have not been all investigated in previous vision research. Under the stimulus conditions which were 0-20 deg, 20-40 deg, and 40-60 deg eccentricity black-and-white checkerboard patterns, we measured the blood oxygenation level-dependent f MRI contrast response at five contrast levels (6, 12, 24, 48, and 96%) in the visual areas. On the basis of these data, the central and pericentral visual areas had low-contrast gain, whereas the peripheral visual areas had high-contrast gain. In addition, our results showed that the signals fundamentally shift during visual processing through posterior visual cortical areas (V1, V2, and V3) to superior visual cortical areas (V3A and MT+).

84905252405	Posterior insula role on semantic processing for Japanese in Chinese-Japanese bilinguals	Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), much knowledge has been gained in understanding how the brain is activated during controlled experiments of language tasks in alphabetic subjects and in logographic language subjects. While previous studies have compared performance between alphabetic and Chinese subjects, few data were about Japanese-speaking individuals. In this study, we used fMRI to investigate brain activations in processing Japanese semantic and font size by visual judgment tasks in six Japanese subjects. Different activation patterns were observed between semantic and font size judgment processing. We conclude that constellation of neural substrates was different for semantic processing. © 2014 International Information Institute.

84905259150	MRI-compatible tactile orientation stimulator to investigate neural mechanisms of tactile orientation discrimination	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most recently developed forms of neuro imaging, uses MRI to measure the haemodynamic response related to neural activity. In this study, we developed a tactile orientation system using under high magnetic environment. The device is MRI-compatible and can serve to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms of tactile orientation discrimination. The primary components of the tactile orientation presentation system include a computer, five tactile orientation domes, two ultrasonic motors, a motor controller and a reaction key. We evaluated the function and precision of system in a magnetic field. The results showed that the device performance is unaffected by the magnetic field, nor does the device interfere with the magnetic field, making it usable with fMRI. Furthermore, a tactile orientation discrimination fMRI experiment was conducted using the system. Compared to the baseline, the most prominent activation areas evoked by the discrimination tasks were in the bilateral primary and secondary somatosensory area, medial frontal gyrus, posterior parietal cortex and lateral occipital complex. In summary, these results indicated that the brain activation can be reliably detected with the present device. © 2014 International Information Institute.

84906972092	Experimental study of information processing application in second language to computer interface of brain	The computer how to identify the language? How the brain controls the brain computer interface (BCI) equipment? Reading in a second language (L2) is a complex task that entails an interaction between L2 and the native language (L1). Previous studies have suggested that bilingual subjects recruit the neural system of their logographic L1 (Chinese) reading and apply it to alphabetic L2 (English) reading. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to visualize Japanese-Chinese bilinguals' brain activity in phonological processing of Japanese Kanji (L1) and Chinese characters (L2) and application to BCI, two written languages with highly similar orthography. In the experiment, the subjects were asked to judge whether two Japanese Kanji (or Chinese characters) presented at the left and right side of the fixation point rhymed with each other. A font size decision task was used as a control task, where the subjects judged whether the two Japanese Kanji (or Chinese characters) had an identical physical size. Subjects indicated a positive response by pressing the key corresponding to the index finger and a negative response by pressing the key corresponding to the middle finger of their right hand. The result showed that our bilingual Japanese subjects have large overlaps in the neural substrates for phonological processing of both native and second language. Our results are application to brain computer interface. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84906976014	An fMRI study on the effect of distance in the shifting of visuospatial attention	Attentional shift (or shift of attention) occurs when directing attention to a point to increase the efficiency of processing that point and includes inhibition to decrease attentional resources to unwanted or irrelevant inputs. Shifting of attention is needed to allocate attentional resources to more efficiently process information from a stimulus. Research has shown that when an object or area is attended, processing operates more efficiently. Task switching costs occur when performance on a task suffers due to the increased effort added in shifting attention. There are competing theories that attempt to explain why and how attention is shifted as well as how attention is moved through space. But about the effect of distance in the shifting of visual spatial attention was unknown until now. In this experiment, we used a long or short distance arrow, to promote the subjects to shift attention by the arrow. And the attention was manipulated to visual spatial orienting by this visually cue stimuli. There are four experimental tasks were designed, there are LR short shifting task, RL short shifting task, LR long shifting task, RL long shifting task. In these tasks, when the visual stimuli were appeared, subjects were asked to fast and accurate to press the response key. The reaction times for spatial location attention were recorded. During the experiment, we also recorded the subject's brain imaging results. And found the brain regions related to the shifting distance of visual spatial attention. © 2014 IEEE.

84906979386	Different neural network for exogenous temporal expectations under sub-second and supra-second in fMRI	Timing is required for both estimating the duration of a presently unfolding event, and forecasting when a future event will occur. When participants used a dynamic visual spatio-temporal trajectory stimulus to predict the final position, exogenous temporal expectations are engaged. However, it is still not clear whether different neural networks are used to measure sub-second and supra-second temporal durations. Here, we used fMRI to find out the differences between brain activity which measure 600ms and 1800ms in an exogenous temporal expectation task. We observe bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) show significantly activated during sub-second, bilateral MT+ [suggested to contain both middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST)], right superior parietal lobule (SPL), and left inferior parietal cortex (IPC) are more active in the 1800ms condition. Overall, this research shows that maybe different components are used for sub-second and supra-second in exogenous temporal expectation. © 2014 IEEE.
