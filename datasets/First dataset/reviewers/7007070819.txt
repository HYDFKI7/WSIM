84949089967	Noise figure verification using cold-Source and Y-factor technique for amplifier and down-converted mixer	In the past, RF engineers usually used Y-factor technique to measure and obtain noise figure (NF) of device under test (DUT). In recent years, the cold-Source technique was developed for NF calculation and measurement in the spectrum analyzer. In addition, the built-in receiver module in a vector network analyzer (VNA) instrument with cold-source technique to calibrate its receiver can also support NF measurement. Therefore, this paper investigates NF measurement verification using cold-source and Y-factor technique for amplifier and down-converted mixer in the VNA instrument and the noise figure analyzer (NFA) instrument.

34648824873	On-chip transmission line modeling and applications to millimeter-wave circuit design in 0.13um CMOS technology	This paper presents the on-chip transmission line modeling and applications to circuit design at millimeterwave (mm-wave) frequencies. The microstrip model of circuit simulators benefits in fast calculations of the characteristics of microstrip lines. As the structure of on-chip microstrip differs from the modeled structure, two key parameters of the microstrip model need to be modified for the different electromagnetic (EM) behavior according to the measured microstrip line. With proper parameters, the traditional transmission line model is able to accurately predict the real characteristic of on-chip microstrip lines without time-consuming EM simulation. A mm-wave microstrip line filter and a single-stage cascode low noise amplifier (LNA) are fabricated to verify the model. All passive components for input/output matching networks and bias networks are onchip. The LNA takes the supply voltage and dc current of 1.4 V and 10 mA, respectively. A gain of 3.8dB and an input/output return loss of 8.5/7.0dB are measured at 60.3GHz. The simulation results in both circuits are in good agreement with measured data. © 2007 IEEE.

34748831714	A low phase-noise 9-GHz CMOS quadrature-VCO using novel source-follower coupling technique	A 9-GHz quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (QVCO) with an improvement of 1/f noise performance due to the use of proposed source-follower coupling technique is presented. In contrast to conventional parallel or series coupling methods by which the coupling transistors are operated in saturation region, the source-follower coupling technique, which uses a coupling transistor operated in cut-off region, is invented. Therefore, 1/f noise is much lower than that of the conventional topologies due to the less turn-on duty cycle of the coupling-transistor than that of conventional one, which in turns results in smaller phase noise. It is found experimentally that the phase noise of the QVCO can be reduced by more than 8 dB due to the suppression the 1/f noise of coupling transistor by changing its operation condition from saturation to cut-off region. This QVCO achieves a phase noise of -115 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz-offset away from the 9.17 GHz carrier, corresponding to a figure-of-merit (FOM) of -183.4 dBc/Hz. © 2007 IEEE.

The CMOS chip is based on the TSMC 0.35mm process with post-process gold metallization. The sensing membrane is surrounded with two gold rings, which can be used as a reference electrode or an enzyme-immobilizing material for pH-value or biomolecule-concentration detection.

The output pulse frequency is linearly proportional to the effective gate voltage of the ISFET, which is immersed in the analyzed solution with a stably biasing reference electrode. A current-offset structure is added into the oscillator to shift the transfer characteristic line of the output frequency versus the effective input voltage, which usually varies due to process variation. The transfer characteristics of the pulse frequency versus pH value are measured by an external Ag/AgCl reference electrode and an on-chip gold reference electrode, respectively. The built-in gold reference electrode brings about a larger sensitivity.

50649105205	Performance degeneration of CMOS RF power cells after hot-carrier and load mismatch stresses	In this paper, we investigate the performance degradation of nMOS transistors due to hot-carrier effect and drain power mismatch. The DC and RF characteristics, such as drain current, threshold voltage, transconductance, power gain, etc., are affected under some kinds of stresses. During the power contour measurement by a load-pull system, the transistors experience the reflection power from load for the most part of measurement time. This mainly results from mismatching impedance and will make drain current degenerated. The degree of the degeneration depends on the quantity of load mismatch and device layout pattern of power cells. From the measurement results, it is found that the degradation can be mitigated by a dispersive layout structure. From the experimental results, the layout of power cells can be designed properly to mitigate the degeneration of power performances and improve the reliability of circuits when designing CMOS RF power amplifiers.

The backlight module usually accounts for the major part of power dissipation in a portable device. Thus, to extend the operation time of a portable device, a high efficiency backlight module should be employed. White light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) have replaced cold cathode fluorescent lamps as backlight modules in portable electronics in recently years due to their superior power efficiency. This paper presents a high efficiency WLED driver with an integrated boost DC-DC converter that can drive a series of WLEDs using a single lithium-ion battery, which is the most popular power source for portable devices. As unexpected operation conditions can result in the failure of the driver, battery, or inductor, the driver integrates protection circuits for over current, over voltage, and under voltage. The driver was fabricated in the TSMC 0.25-μm 60-V bipolar-CMOS-DMOS process. The over current protection level is set to 2 A. The over voltage protection is set to 50 V, allowing the boost converter to drive 12 WLEDs in series connection.

Compared to existing CMOS MEMS designs, which uses foundry processes, the proposed design imposes several new challenges including: carrying two voltage levels on a non-warping suspended plate, metal-to-metal contact, and etc. Different combinations of oxide-metal films and post-CMOS process are investigated to achieve a non-warping suspended structure layer. And different wet etchants are investigated to remove sacrificial layers without attacking structure layers and features. In a prototype design, the selected structure layer is metal-3 and oxide film; the device is released using AD-10 and titanium etchant; the device is 250 μm long, 100 μm wide, and 1.5 μm gap. The experimental results show that the suspended plate slightly curls down 0.485 μm. This device can be actuated by 10/0 V with a moving distance 50nm. The resonant frequency is measured at 36 kHz. Due to the damage of the tungsten plugs, the logic function can only be verified by its mechanical movements instead of electrical readouts for now.

79953706293	Develop a novel thermal switch through CMOS MEMS fabrication process	This paper focuses on implementing two novel CMOS-MEMS type switches: buckling type and thermal type, by using commercially available TSMC 0.35 μm two-poly four-metal (2P4M) CMOS process. There are two novel designs in these two type switches: first, the soft contact structure with post-processing fabrication; second, using residual stress to achieve large structural deformation in buckling type and thermal type switches. To create the soft contact structure, residual gradient stress effect has been utilized to make bending-down curvatures. According to the experiments, the layer Metal1 has the largest negative residual gradient stress [1] effect that can achieve the largest negative deflection in z-axis. Because the structure will bend down after post-processing release, larger lateral contact area are set up to gain the lower contact miss ability. In the post-processing fabrication, 0.3μm thickness gold will be deposited on the contact tips. Due to the essence of gold, comparing with aluminum, has no oxidation issue, gold also has the advantage of higher conductivity to reduce the electrical power loss. In the buckling type design, the switch uses residual stress to achieve lateral buckling effect to solve long distance problem. In the thermal type design, this paper design a folded-flexure [2, 3] with the electro-thermal excitation to turn the switch on or off. In the prototype, the device size is 500 μm × 400 μm and the gap between two contact pads is 9 μm in offstate. on the experimental results, the switch can work stably at 3 volts, and the displacement of the thermal type switch can achieve 2.7μm, which is sufficient for the mechanism of switching-on or switching-off.

79955600672	A high current accuracy boost white LED driver based on offset calibration technique	The current accuracy and power efficiency of a boost white light-emitting-diode (WLED) driver are usually design tradeoffs since the power efficiency is inversely proportional to the reference voltage, whereas the current accuracy is proportional to the reference voltage. Traditionally, a boost WLED driver with high current accuracy and high power efficiency demand a large chip area because mismatch decreases with increasing size. This paper proposes an offset calibration technique to improve both current accuracy and power efficiency while keeping the chip area relatively small. An overvoltage protection (OVP) circuit and an overcurrent protection (OCP) circuit prevent the proposed driver from being damaged due to WLED failure. The design is fabricated in a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 0.25-μm 60-V bipolarCMOSdouble-diffused-MOS process. The measurement results show that the current variation is less than 1% when the input voltage and the number of loaded WLEDs are varied in a wide range. The maximum power conversion efficiency is 86.7% at a 5-V input with four loaded WLEDs. The OVP is 58 V, and the OCP is 2 A. © 2011 IEEE.

79959236918	A high efficiency boost white LED driver with an integrated Schottky diode	Size and battery life are important issues for portable devices. White light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) have thus replaced cold cathode fluorescent lamps as backlight sources. Since WLEDs are small and highly efficient, a good WLED backlight driver design can reduce the size of portable devices and extend their operation time. This paper proposes a high efficiency boost WLED driver with an integrated Schottky diode. The DC-DC converter structure allows high efficiency and the on-chip compensator and Schottky diode reduce the board area. The driver also enhances the substrate noise immunity. The simulation results show that the substrate noise was reduced from ±1.8 to ±0.8 V. The driver was fabricated in the TSMC 0.25-μm bipolar-CMOS-DMOS process. For a load of six VLEDs at an input voltage of 4.3 V, the power efficiency was 91.6%. © 2010 IEEE.

Melatonin was imprinted into poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol), EVAL, which was coated onto ZnO nanorod arrays. The ZnO nanorods not only increased the surface area for sensing target molecules, but also constituted an optical sensing element, as the ZnO fluorescence decreases when targets bind to the imprinted EVAL film; the fluorescence decrease, as a function of melatonin concentration, is well fit by a Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) with 44. mol& ethylene showed the best imprinting effectiveness (ratio of the fluorescence decrease on binding melatonin to imprinted vs. non-imprinted EVAL-coated ZnO nanorod arrays) among the several compositions studied. In real urine analysis, the MIP films responded linearly to added (exogenous) melatonin, even in the presence of many possible interfering compounds in urine.

84875830922	A micro-cantilever sensor chip based on contact angle analysis for a label-free troponin i immunoassay	Cantilever sensors have been extensively explored as a promising technique for real-time and label-free analyses in biological systems. A major sensing principle utilized by state-of-the-art cantilever sensors is based on analyte-induced surface stress changes, which result in static bending of a cantilever. The sensor performance, however, suffers from the intrinsically small change in surface stress induced by analytes, especially for molecular recognition such as antigen-antibody binding. Through the contact angle change on a tailored solid surface, it is possible to convert a tiny surface stress into a capillary force - a much larger physical quantity needed for a practical sensor application. In this work, a micro-cantilever sensor based on contact angle analysis (CAMCS) was proposed to effectively enhance the sensitivity of a sensor in proportion to the square of the length to thickness ratio of the cantilever structure. CAMCS chips were fabricated using a standard complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process to demonstrate a 1250-fold enhancement in the sensitivity of surface stress to bioanalyte adsorption using a piezoresistive sensing method. A real-time and label-free troponin I (cTnI) immunoassay, which is now widely used in clinics and considered a gold standard for the early diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular disease, was performed to demonstrate cTnI detection levels as low as 1 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>. The short detection time of this assay was within several minutes, which matches the detection time of commercially available instruments that are based on fluorescence-labeling techniques. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The chip implementation was achieved in the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) 0.35 μm CMOS process. The implemented chip size was 6 mm by 5 mm. It included microcantilever DNA sensors, readout circuits, a microcontroller unit (MCU), and an on-off key (OOK) wireless transceiver (TX/RX). The DNA sensing device, based on piezoresistive type microcantilever, was achieved by post processes after the standard CMOS circuit fabrication. The post processes included Au deposition to enhance its biocompatibility and reactive ion etching (RIE) to release the miscrocentilever. To evaluate the sensing device, the 19-mer nucleotide probe DNA of HBV conservative sequence was modified with thiol group to cross link onto the Au layer. To enhance the performance of the integrated SoC, furthermore, the oscillator-based self-calibrated readout circuit was designed and implemented. In addition, the wireless capability was accomplished by the OOK TX/RX. The experimental result revealed that the DNA detection SoC has good selectivity between one base-pair mismatched DNA and all matched DNA. This DNA SoC demonstrated the sensing limitation of 1 pM in the label-free DNA detection. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84876071998	Analysis and suppression of overcurrent in boost LED drivers	Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are the major backlighting source used in liquid crystal displays and dimming the LEDs is a common approach to increase the contrast ratio or save power. Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is more popular than analog methods of dimming, because it produces a less pronounced shift in chromaticity. However, in PWM dimming mode, overcurrent can shorten the lifespan of the LEDs. This paper proposes a technique to overcome the drawbacks inherent in conventional approaches to the suppression of overcurrent in LED devices. The design was implemented using the TSMC 0.25-μm 60-V bipolar-CMOS-DMOS process, resulting in a chip area of 2.2 mm
