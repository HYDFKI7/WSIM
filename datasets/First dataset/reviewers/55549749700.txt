2942554826	NB-3/Notch1 pathway via Deltex1 promotes neural progenitor cell differentiation into oligodendrocytes	Neurons and glia in the vertebrate central nervous system arise in temporally distinct, albeit overlapping, phases. Neurons are generated first followed by astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from common progenitor cells. Increasing evidence indicates that axon-derived signals spatiotemporally modulate oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin formation. Our previous observations demonstrate that F3/contactin is a functional ligand of Notch during oligodendrocyte maturation, revealing the existence of another group of Notch ligands. Here, we establish that NB-3, a member of the F3/contactin family, acts as a novel Notch ligand to participate in oligodendrocyte generation. NB-3 triggers nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain and promotes oligodendrogliogenesis from progenitor cells and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells via Deltex1. In primary oligodendrocytes, NB-3 increases myelin-associated glycoprotein transcripts. Thus, the NB-3/Notch signaling pathway may prove to be a molecular handle to treat demyelinating diseases.

33750577891	Carbohydrate mimics promote functional recovery after peripheral nerve repair	Objective: The outcome of peripheral nerve repair is often unsatisfactory, and efficient therapies are not available. We tested the therapeutic potential of functional mimics of the human natural killer cell glycan (3-sulfoglucuronyl β1-3 galactoside) (HNK-1) epitope, a carbohydrate indicated to favor specificity of motor reinnervation in mice. Methods: We applied a linear HNK-1 mimic peptide, scrambled peptide, or vehicle substances in polyethylene cuffs used to reconstruct the severed femoral nerves of adult mice. We used video-based motion analysis and morphological and tracing techniques to monitor the outcome of nerve repair. Results: After glycomimetic application, quadriceps muscle function recovered to 93% of normal within 3 months. Restoration of function was less complete (71-76%) in control groups. Better functional recovery was associated with larger motoneuron somata, better axonal myelination in the quadriceps nerve, and enhanced precision of target reinnervation. Lesion-induced death of motoneurons was reduced by 20 to 25%. The glycomimetic enhanced survival and neurite outgrowth of both mouse and human motoneurons in vitro by 30 to 75%. Application of a novel cyclic glycomimetic also enhanced functional recovery in vivo. Interpretation: The improved outcome of nerve repair after glycomimetic application may be attributed to neurotrophic effects. Our results hold promise for therapeutic use in humans. © 2006 American Neurological Association Published by Wiley-Liss, Inc., through Wiley Subscription Services.

33750955313	Polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule is involved in induction of long-term potentiation and memory acquisition and consolidation in a fear-conditioning paradigm	Polysialic acid (PSA) regulates functions of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) during development and in neuroplasticity in the adult; the underlying mechanisms at different phases of learning and memory consolidation are, however, unknown. To investigate the contributions of PSA versus the extracellular domain of the NCAM glycoprotein backbone to synaptic plasticity, we applied NCAM, PSA-NCAM, and PSA to acute slices of the hippocampal CA1 region of NCAM-deficient mice and measured their effects on long-term potentiation (LTP). Remarkably, only PSA and PSA-NCAM, but not NCAM restored normal LTP. Application of these molecules to the dorsal hippocampus of wild-type mice showed that PSA-NCAM and PSA, but not NCAM, injected before fear conditioning, impaired formation of hippocampus-dependent contextual memory. Consolidation of contextual memory was affected by PSA-NCAM only when injected during its late, but not early phases. None of the tested compounds disturbed extrahippocampal-cued memory. Mice lacking the polysialyltransferase (ST8SialV/PST) responsible for attachment of PSA to NCAM in adulthood showed a mild deficit only in hippocampal contextual learning, when compared with NCAM-deficient mice that were disturbed in both contextual and cued memories. Contextual and tone memory in NCAM-deficient mice could be partially restored by injection of PSA-NCAM, but not of NCAM, into the hippocampus, suggesting that the impact of PSA-NCAM in synaptic plasticity and learning is not mediated by modulation of NCAM-NCAM homophilic interactions. In conclusion, our data support the view that polysialylated NCAM is involved in both formation and late consolidation of contextual memory. Copyright © 2006 Society for Neuroscience.

33751087210	Neural cell adhesion molecule L1-transfected embryonic stem cells promote functional recovery after excitotoxic lesion of the mouse striatum	We have generated a murine embryonic stem cell line constitutively expressing L1 at all stages of neural differentiation to investigate the effects of L1 overexpression on stem cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, cell death, and ability to influence drug-induced rotation behavior in an animal model of Huntington's disease. L1-transfected cells showed decreased cell proliferation in vitro, enhanced neuronal differentiation in vitro and in vivo, and decreased astrocytic differentiation in vivo without influencing cell death compared with nontransfected cells. L1 overexpression also resulted in an increased yield of GABAergic neurons and enhanced migration of embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursor cells into the lesioned striatum. Mice grafted with L1-transfected cells showed recovery in rotation behavior 1 and 4 weeks, but not 8 weeks, after transplantation compared with mice that had received nontransfected cells, thus demonstrating for the first time that a recognition molecule is capable of improving functional recovery during the initial phase in a syngeneic transplantation paradigm.

33845882730	Neural recognition molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily: Signaling transducers of axon guidance and neuronal migration	Recognition molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily have important roles in neuronal interactions during ontogeny, including migration, survival, axon guidance and synaptic targeting. Their downstream signal transduction events specify whether a cell changes its place of residence or projects axons and dendrites to targets in the brain, allowing the construction of a dynamic neural network. A wealth of recent discoveries shows that cell adhesion molecules interact with attractant and repellent guidance receptors to control growth cone and cell motility in a coordinate fashion. We focus on the best-studied subclasses, the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM and the L1 family of adhesion molecules, which share important structural and functional features. We have chosen these paradigmatic molecules and their interactions with other recognition molecules as instructive for elucidating the mechanisms by which other recognition molecules may guide cell interactions during development or modify their function as a result of injury, learning and memory. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.

33845962869	Neural cell adhesion molecule-associated polysialic acid inhibits NR2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and prevents glutamate-induced cell death	The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and its associated glycan polysialic acid play important roles in the development of the nervous system and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in the adult. Here, we investigated the influence of polysialic acid on NMDA receptor activity. We found that glutamate-elicited NMDA receptor currents in cultured hippocampal neurons were reduced by ≈30% with the application of polysialic acid or polysialylated NCAM but not by the sialic acid monomer, chondroitin sulfate, or non-polysialylated NCAM. Polysialic acid inhibited NMDA receptor currents elicited by 3 μM glutamate but not by 30 μM glutamate, suggesting that polysialic acid acts as a competitive antagonist, possibly at the glutamate binding site. The polysialic acid induced effects were mimicked and fully occluded by the NR2B subunit specific antagonist, ifenprodil. Recordings from single synaptosomal NMDA receptors reconstituted in lipid bilayers revealed that polysialic acid reduced open probability but not the conductance of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors in a polysialic acid and glutamate concentration-dependent manner. The activity of single NR2B-lacking synaptosomal NMDA receptors was not affected by polysialic acid. Application of polysialic acid to hippocampal cultures reduced excitotoxic cell death induced by low micromolar concentration of glutamate via activation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors, whereas enzymatic removal of polysialic acid resulted in increased cell death that occluded glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. These observations indicate that the cell adhesion molecule-associated glycan polysialic acid is able to prevent excitotoxicity via inhibition of NR2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

33847625431	Oligodendrocytes regulate formation of nodes of Ranvier via the recognition molecule OMgp	The molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of oligodendrocytes in formation of the nodes of Ranvier (NORs) remain poorly understood. Here we show that oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp) aggregates specifically at NORs. Nodal location of OMgp does not occur along demyelinated axons of either Shiverer or proteolipid protein (PLP) transgenic mice. Over-expression of OMgp in OLN-93 cells facilitates process outgrowth. In transgenic mice in which expression of OMgp is down-regulated, myelin thickness declines, and lateral oligodendrocyte loops at the node-paranode junction are less compacted and even join together with the opposite loops, which leads to shortened nodal gaps. Notably, each of these structural abnormalities plus modest down-regulation of expression of Na

38049051162	Neural recognition molecules CHL1 and NB-3 regulate apical dendrite orientation in the neocortex via PTPα	Apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex have a stereotypic orientation that is important for neuronal function. Neural recognition molecule Close Homolog of L1 (CHL1) has been shown to regulate oriented growth of apical dendrites in the mouse caudal cortex. Here we show that CHL1 directly associates with NB-3, a member of the F3/contactin family of neural recognition molecules, and enhances its cell surface expression. Similar to CHL1, NB-3 exhibits high-caudal to low-rostral expression in the deep layer neurons of the neocortex. NB-3-deficient mice show abnormal apical dendrite projections of deep layer pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex. Both CHL1 and NB-3 interact with protein tyrosine phosphatase α (PTPα) and regulate its activity. Moreover, deep layer pyramidal neurons of PTPα-deficient mice develop misoriented, even inverted, apical dendrites. We propose a signaling complex in which PTPα mediates CHL1 and NB-3-regulated apical dendrite projection in the developing caudal cortex. ©2008 European Molecular Biology Organization.

0032919002	Prevention of neuronal cell death by neural adhesion molecules L1 and CHL1	The effects of L1-Fc and CHL1-Fc fusion proteins on neuronal survival were investigated. Cerebellar granule neurons of mouse and hippocampal neurons of rat embryo undergo apoptosis when cultured in serum-free medium. Treatment with chimeric proteins containing the extracellular domains of the neural adhesion molecules L1 or CHL1 fused to the Fc region of human immunoglobulin significantly enhanced the survival of neurons. Compared to the control, the percentage of surviving neurons increased about 60 % and 45% with L1 and CHL1 fusion proteins, respectively. A fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of NCAM had no effect on survival. The L1 and CHL1 fusion proteins were effective both in soluble form or when offered as a substrate, with the maximal effect at about 1 μg/mL. To explore the intracellular events related to the neuronal survival effects of L1-Fc fusion protein, Bcl-2 and c-Jun expression were analyzed by Western blotting. The level of Bcl-2 in cerebellar granule neurons was increased by treatment with L1-Fc at both 1 and 5 days of culture. The level of c-Jun was not significantly affected at the early time point and was reduced by L1-Fc fusion protein after long-term culture. The results demonstrate that the neural adhesion molecule L1 and its relative CHL1 are potential neuronal survival factors for neurons of the central nervous system. Bcl-2 may serve as one of the intracellular mediators of the neuronal survival effects of L1.

0034014530	Formation of myelin after transplantation of neural precursor cells into the retina of young postnatal mice	We have isolated neural precursors from the striata of embryonic wildtype and transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein. Cells were expanded in vitro in the presence of epidermal growth factor and transplanted into the retina of young postnatal mice. One month after transplantation, cells showed widespread integration into the host tissue and differentiated into a variety of morphologically distinct cell types. A fraction of cells was identified as oligodendrocytes exclusively located in the immediate vicinity to the nerve fiber layer. Similar results were obtained with neural precursors isolated from embryonic spinal cord. Differentiated oligodendrocytes and myelin were still detectable in the host tissue 4 months after transplantation, the latest time point investigated. Remarkably, prolonged survival periods of experimental animals resulted in a significant increase in the number of donor-derived oligodendrocytes and the area of the nerve fiber layer being myelinated. The presence of high numbers of oligodendrocytes and their location close to the retinal nerve fiber layer suggest that the differentiation of transplanted neural precursors into distinct neural cell types is influenced by host-derived environmental cues.

In this study, we have identified TAG1 as a functional ligand of APP. We found that, through an extracellular interaction with APP, TAG1 increased AICD release and triggered Fe65-dependent activity in a γ-secretase-dependent manner.

34247585173	Recognition molecules and neural repair	Neural recognition molecules were discovered and characterized initially for their functional roles in cell adhesion as regulators of affinity between cells and the extracellular matrix in vitro. They were then recognized as mediators or co-receptors which trigger signal transduction mechanisms affecting cell adhesion and de-adhesion. Their involvement in contact attraction and repulsion relies on cell-intrinsic properties that are modulated by the spatial contexts of their expression at particular stages of ontogenetic development, in synaptic plasticity and during regeneration after injury. The functional roles of recognition molecules in cell proliferation and migration, determination of developmental fate, growth cone guidance, and synapse formation, stabilization and modulation have been well documented not only by in vitro, but also by in vivo studies that have been greatly aided by generation of genetically altered mice. More recently, the functions of recognition molecules have been investigated under conditions of neural repair and manipulated using a broad range of genetic and pharmacological approaches to achieve a beneficial outcome. The principal aim of most therapeutically oriented approaches has been to neutralize inhibitory factors. However, less attention has been paid to enhancing repair by stimulating the stimulatory factors. When considering potential therapeutic strategies, it is worth considering that a single recognition molecule can possess domains that are conducive or repellent and that the spatial distribution of recognition molecules can determine the overall function: Recognition molecules may be repellent for neurite outgrowth when presented as barriers or steep-concentration gradients and conducive when presented as uniform substrates. The focus of this review will be on the more recent attempts to study the conducive mechanisms with the expectation that they may be able to tip the balance from a regeneration inhospitable to a hospitable environment. It is likely that a combination of the two principles, as multifactorial as each principle may be in itself, will be of therapeutic value in humans. © 2007 The Authors.

77954514610	Improved reversal learning and working memory and enhanced reactivity to novelty in mice with enhanced GABAergic innervation in the dentate gyrus	The balance between excitation and inhibition controls fundamental aspects of the hippocampal function. Here, we report an increase in the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory neurons in the dentate gyrus, accompanied by γ-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor-dependent impairment of synaptic plasticity and enhancement of activity-dependent changes in excitability in anesthetized adult mice deficient for the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-R (TNR). TNR-deficient mice showed faster reversal learning, improved working memory, and enhanced reactivity to novelty than wild-type littermates. Remarkably, in wild-type and TNR-deficient mice, faster reversal learning rates correlated at the individual animal level with ratios of parvalbumin-positive interneurons to granule cells and densities of parvalbumin-positive terminals on somata of granule cells. Our data demonstrate that modification of the extracellular matrix by ablation of TNR leads to a new structural and functional design of the dentate gyrus, with enhanced GABAergic innervation, that is, enhanced ratio of inhibitory to excitatory cells, and altered plasticity, promoting working memory and reversal learning. In wild-type mice, the enhanced ratio of inhibitory to excitatory cells in the dentate gyrus also positively correlated with reversal learning, indicating that level of inhibition regulates specific aspects of learning independent of the TNR gene. © The Author 2010.

84861450734	L1CAM increases MAP2 expression via the MAPK pathway to promote neurite outgrowth	The neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM) promotes neurite outgrowth via mechanisms that are not completely understood, but are known to involve the cytoskeleton. Here, we show that L1 binds directly to the microtubule associated protein 2c (MAP2c). This isoform of MAP2 is predominantly expressed in developing neurons. We found that the mRNA and protein levels of MAP2c, but not of MAP2a/b, are reduced in brains of young adult L1-deficient transgenic mice. We show via ELISA, that MAP2c, but not MAP2a/b, binds directly to the intracellular domain of L1. Remarkably, all these MAP2 isoforms co-immunoprecipitate with L1, suggesting that MAP2a/b associates with L1 via intermediate binding partners. The expression levels of MAP2a/b/c correlate with those of L1 in different brain regions of early postnatal mice, while expression levels of heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) or actin do not. L1 enhances the expression of MAP2a/b/c in cultured hippocampal neurons depending on activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Deficiency in both L1 and MAP2a/b/c expression results in reduced neurite outgrowth in vitro. We propose that the L1-triggered increase in MAP2a/b/c expression is required to promote neurite outgrowth. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84866659467	Promotion of Spinal Cord Regeneration by Neural Stem Cell-Secreted Trimerized Cell Adhesion Molecule L1	The L1 cell adhesion molecule promotes neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival in homophilic and heterophilic interactions and enhances neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival homophilically, i.e. by self binding. We investigated whether exploitation of homophilic and possibly also heterophilic mechanisms of neural stem cells overexpressing the full-length transmembrane L1 and a secreted trimer engineered to express its extracellular domain would be more beneficial for functional recovery of the compression injured spinal cord of adult mice than stem cells overexpressing only full-length L1 or the parental, non-engineered cells. Here we report that stem cells expressing trimeric and full-length L1 are indeed more efficient in promoting locomotor recovery when compared to stem cells overexpressing only full-length L1 or the parental stem cells. The trimer expressing stem cells were also more efficient in reducing glial scar volume and expression of chondroitin sulfates and the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2. They were also more efficient in enhancing regrowth/sprouting and/or preservation of serotonergic axons, and remyelination and/or myelin sparing. Moreover, degeneration/dying back of corticospinal cord axons was prevented more by the trimer expressing stem cells. These results encourage the view that stem cells engineered to drive the beneficial functions of L1 via homophilic and heterophilic interactions are functionally optimized and may thus be of therapeutic value. © 2012 He et al.

84867450111	HMGB1 in development and diseases of the central nervous system	High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is widely expressed in cells of vertebrates in two forms: a nuclear "architectural" factor and a secreted inflammatory factor. During early brain development, HMGB1 displays a complex temporal and spatial distribution pattern in the central nervous system. It facilitates neurite outgrowth and cell migration critical for processes, such as forebrain development. During adulthood, HMGB1 serves to induce neuroinflammation after injury, such as lesions in the spinal cord and brain. Receptor for advanced glycation end products and Toll-like receptors signal transduction pathways mediateHMGB1-induced neuroinflammation and necrosis. Increased levels of endogenous HMGB1 have also been detected in neurodegenerative diseases. However, in Huntington's disease, HMGB1 has been reported to protect neurons through activation of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease and 5′-flap endonuclease-1, whereas in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, HMGB1 serves as a risk factor for memory impairment, chronic neurodegeneration, and progression of neuroinflammation. Thus, HMGB1 plays important and double-edged roles during neural development and neurodegeneration. The HMGB1-mediated pathological mechanisms have remained largely elusive. Knowledge of these mechanisms is likely to lead to therapeutic targets for neurological diseases. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

84876678710	Tenascins and inflammation in disorders of the nervous system	In vitro and in vivo studies on the role of tenascins have shown that the two paradigmatic glycoproteins of the tenascin family, tenascin-C (TnC) and tenascin-R (TnR) play important roles in cell proliferation and migration, fate determination, axonal pathfinding, myelination, and synaptic plasticity. As components of the extracellular matrix, both molecules show distinct, but also overlapping dual functions in inhibiting and promoting cell interactions depending on the cell type, developmental stage and molecular microenvironment. They are expressed by neurons and glia as well as, for TnC, by cells of the immune system. The functional relationship between neural and immune cells becomes relevant in acute and chronic nervous system disorders, in particular when the blood brain and blood peripheral nerve barriers are compromised. In this review, we will describe the functional parameters of the two molecules in cell interactions during development and, in the adult, in synaptic activity and plasticity, as well as regeneration after injury, with TnC being conducive for regeneration and TnR being inhibitory for functional recovery. Although not much is known about the role of tenascins in neuroinflammation, we will describe emerging knowledge on the interplay between neural and immune cells in autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and polyneuropathies. We will attempt to point out the directions of experimental approaches that we envisage would help gaining insights into the complex interplay of TnC and TnR with the cells that express them in pathological conditions of nervous and immune systems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Wien.

84887471258	Neuregulin 1-β regulates cell adhesion molecule L1 expression in the cortex and hippocampus of mice	Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1) functions in neuronal migration, survival and differentiation as well as synaptogenesis during ontogenetic development and maintenance of synaptic functions in the adult mammalian brain. The neural adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM) functions in similar overlapping, but also non-overlapping roles in the nervous system. In the present study, we therefore investigated some aspects of the functional relationship between Nrg1 and L1 in mammalian neural cells. Nrg1 regulates the expression of L1 in cultures of both human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons. To analyze the role of Nrg1 on L1 expression in vivo, young adult male mice received intraperitoneal injections of Nrg1 or PBS (vehicle control). The correlation between Nrg1 and L1 expression was tested by qPCR, Western blot analysis, and immunocytology. Our data indicate that neuregulin 1-β (Nrg1β) increases L1 expression in neurons of the cerebral cortex, and decreases expression in neurons of the hippocampus in vitro and in vivo. In addition, Nrg1 induces phosphorylation of its receptors, ErbB2 and ErbB4, the predominant ErbB receptors in the nervous system. These results show that Nrg1β affects expression of L1 in the central nervous system and in parallel activates the ErbB receptors for Nrg1, suggesting a crosstalk between molecules that are of prime importance for nervous system functions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84908232279	Engineered N-cadherin and L1 biomimetic substrates concertedly promote neuronal differentiation, neurite extension and neuroprotection of human neural stem cells	We investigated the design of neurotrophic biomaterial constructs for human neural stem cells, guided by neural developmental cues of N-cadherin and L1 adhesion molecules. Polymer substrates fabricated either as two-dimensional (2-D) films or three-dimensional (3-D) microfibrous scaffolds were functionalized with fusion chimeras of N-cadherin-Fc alone and in combination with L1-Fc, and the effects on differentiation, neurite extension and survival of H9 human-embryonic-stem-cell-derived neural stem cells (H9-NSCs) were quantified. Combinations of N-cadherin and L1-Fc co-operatively enhanced neuronal differentiation profiles, indicating the critical nature of the two complementary developmental cues. Notably, substrates presenting low levels of N-cadherin-Fc concentrations, combined with proportionately higher L1-Fc concentration, most enhanced neurite outgrowth and the degree of MAP2+ and neurofilament-M+ H9-NSCs. Low N-cadherin-Fc alone promoted improved cell survival following oxidative stress, compared to higher concentrations of N-cadherin-Fc alone or combinations with L1-Fc. Pharmacological and antibody blockage studies revealed that substrates presenting low levels of N-cadherin are functionally competent so long as they elicit a threshold signal mediated by homophilic N-cadherin and fibroblast growth factor signaling. Overall, these studies highlight the ability of optimal combinations of N-cadherin and L1 to recapitulate a "neurotrophic" microenvironment that enhances human neural stem cell differentiation and neurite outgrowth. Additionally, 3-D fibrous scaffolds presenting low N-cadherin-Fc further enhanced the survival of H9-NSCs compared to equivalent 2-D films. This indicates that similar biofunctionalization approaches based on N-cadherin and L1 can be translated to 3-D "transplantable" scaffolds with enhanced neurotrophic behaviors. Thus, the insights from this study have fundamental and translational impacts for neural-stem-cell-based regenerative medicine.

55549086170	β 1 integrin-mediated effects of tenascin-R domains EGFL and FN6-8 on neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro	Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) have the capacity for self-renewal and differentiation into major classes of central nervous system cell types, such as neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. The determination of fate of NSCs appears to be regulated by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Mounting evidence has shown that extracellular matrix molecules contribute to NSC proliferation and differentiation as extrinsic factors. Here we explore the effects of the epidermal growth factor-like (EGFL) and fibronectin type III homologous domains 6-8 (FN6-8) of the extracellular matrix molecule tenascin-R on NSC proliferation and differentiation. Our results show that domain FN6-8 inhibited NSC proliferation and promoted NSCs differentiation into astrocytes and less into oligodendrocytes or neurons. The EGFL domain did not affect NSC proliferation, but promoted NSC differentiation into neurons and reduced NSC differentiation into astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Treatment of NSCs with β 1 integrin function-blocking antibody resulted in attenuation of inhibition of the effect of FN6-8 on NSC proliferation. The influence of EGFL or FN6-8 on NSCs differentiation was inhibited by β 1 integrin antibody application, implicating β 1 integrin in proliferation and differentiation induced by EGFL and FN6-8 mediated triggering of NSCs. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

60049087070	Cell surface sialylation and fucosylation are regulated by the cell recognition molecule L1 via PLCγ and cooperate to modulate embryonic stem cell survival and proliferation	Cell surface glycosylation patterns are markers of cell type and status. However, the mechanisms regulating surface glycosylation patterns remain unknown. Using a panel of carbohydrate markers, we have shown that cell surface sialylation and fucosylation are upregulated in L1-transfected embryonic stem cells (L1-ESCs). Consistently, the mRNA levels of sialyltransferase ST6Gal1 and ST3Gal4, and fucosyltransferase FUT9 were significantly increased in L1-transfected ESCs. Activation of L1 signaling promoted cell survival and inhibited cell proliferation. ShRNAs knocking down FUT9, ST6Gal1 and ST3Gal4 blocked these effects. A phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) inhibitor and shRNA reduced ST6Gal1, ST3Gal4 and FUT9 mRNA levels in the L1-ESCs. Thus, embryonic stem cell surface sialylation and fucosylation are regulated via PLCγ by L1, with which they cooperate to modulate cell survival and proliferation. © 2009 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

64549128165	Close homologue of adhesion molecule L1 promotes survival of purkinje and granule cells and granule cell migration during murine cerebellar development	Several L1-related adhesion molecules, expressed in a well-coordinated temporospatial pattern during development, are important for fine tuning of specific cerebellar circuitries. We tested the hypothesis that CHL1, the close homologue of L1, abundantly expressed in the developing and adult cerebellum, is also required for normal cerebellar histogenesis. We found that constitutive ablation of CHL1 in mice caused significant loss (20-23%) of Purkinje and granule cells in the mature 2-month-old cerebellum. The ratio of stellate/basket interneurons to Purkinje cells was abnormally high (+38%) in CHL1-deficient (CHL1-/-) mice compared with wild-type (CHL1+/+) littermates, but the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic synaptic inputs to Purkinje cell bodies and dendrites were normal, as were numbers of Golgi interneurons, microglia, astrocytes, and Bergmann glia. Purkinje cell loss occurred before the first postnatal week and was associated with enhanced apoptosis, presumably as a consequence of CHL1 deficiency in afferent axons. In contrast, generation of granule cells, as indicated by in vivo analyses of cell proliferation and death, was unaffected in 1-week-old CHL1-/- mice, but numbers of migrating granule cells in the molecular layer were increased. This increase was likely related to retarded cell migration because CHL1-/- granule cells migrated more slowly than CHL1+/+ cells in vitro, and Bergmann glial processes guiding migration in vivo expressed CHL1 in wild-type mice. Granule cell deficiency in adult CHL1-/- mice appeared to result from decreased precursor cell proliferation after the first postnatal week. Our results indicate that CHL1 promotes Purkinje and granule cell survival and granule cell migration during cerebellar development. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

67349117839	Extracellular GAPDH binds to L1 and enhances neurite outgrowth	We have identified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a binding partner for the cell adhesion molecule L1. GAPDH binds to sites within the extracellular domain of L1, namely the immunoglobulin-like domains I-VI and the fibronectin type III homologous repeats 4-5. Extracellular GAPDH was detected at the cell surface of neuronal cells by surface biotinylation and immunocytochemistry. Addition of GAPDH antibodies to cultured cerebellar neurons inhibited L1-dependent neurite outgrowth in the presence of ATP, while the application of exogenous GAPDH promoted L1-dependent neurite outgrowth. Pre-treatment of substrate-coated L1-Fc with ATP and GAPDH, which phosphorylates L1, subsequently led to an enhanced neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, aggregation of L1-Fc carrying beads was enhanced in the presence of both GAPDH and ATP. L1-dependent neurite outgrowth and aggregation of L1 were diminished in the presence of alkaline phosphatase or a protein kinase inhibitor. Our results show that GAPDH-dependent phosphorylation of L1 is a novel mechanism in regulating L1-mediated neurite outgrowth. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

67649399222	Polysialic acid glycomimetics promote myelination and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury in mice	α2,8 Polysialic acid (PSA) is a carbohydrate attached to the glycoprotein backbone of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and implicated in nervous system development and repair. Here, we investigated whether PSA can improve functional recovery after peripheral nerve lesion in adult mice. We applied a functional PSA mimicking peptide or a control peptide in a polyethylene cuff used to surgically reconnect the severed stumps of the femoral nerve before it bifurcates into the motor and sensory branches. Using video-based motion analysis to monitor motor recovery over a 3 month postoperative period, we observed a better functional outcome in the PSA mimetic-treated than in control mice receiving a control peptide or phosphate buffered saline. Retrograde tracing of regenerated motoneurons and morphometric analyses showed that motoneuron survival, motoneuron soma size and axonal diameters were not affected by treatment with the PSA mimetic. However, remyelination of regenerated axons distal to the injury site was considerably improved by the PSA mimetic indicating that effects on Schwann cells in the denervated nerve may underlie the functional effects seen in motor recovery. In line with this notion was the observation that the PSA mimetic enhanced the elongation of Schwann cell processes and Schwann cell proliferation in vitro, when compared with the control peptide. Moreover, Schwann cell proliferation in vivo was enhanced in both motor and sensory branches of the femoral nerve by application of the PSA mimetic. These effects were likely mediated by NCAM through its interaction with the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), since they were not observed when the PSA mimetic was applied to NCAM-deficient Schwann cells, and since application of two different FGFR inhibitors reduced process elongation from Schwann cells in vitro. Our results indicate the potential of PSA mimetics as therapeutic agents promoting motor recovery and myelination after peripheral nerve injury.

67651127937	Ablation of adhesion molecule L1 in mice favours Schwann cell proliferation and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury	The adhesion molecule L1 is one of the few adhesion molecules known to be beneficial for repair processes in the adult central nervous system of vertebrates by promoting axonal growth and neuronal survival. In the peripheral nervous system, L1 is up-regulated by myelination-competent Schwann cells and regenerating axons after nerve damage but its functional role has remained unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that L1 is, as in the central nervous system, beneficial for nerve regeneration in the peripheral nervous system by performing combined functional and histological analyses of adult L1-deficient mice (L1y/-) and wild-type (L1y/) littermates. Contrary to our hypothesis, quantitative video-based motion analysis revealed better locomotor recovery in L1y/- than in L1y/ mice at 412 weeks after transection and surgical repair of the femoral nerve. Motoneuron regeneration in L1y/- mice was also enhanced as indicated by attenuated post-traumatic loss of motoneurons, enhanced precision of motor reinnervation, larger cell bodies of regenerated motoneurons and diminished loss of inhibitory synaptic input to motoneurons. In search of mechanisms underlying the observed effects, we analysed peripheral nerves at short time-periods (314 days) after transection and found that Schwann cell proliferation is strongly augmented in L1y/- versus L1y/ mice. L1-deficient Schwann cells showed increased proliferation than wild-type Schwann cells, both in vivo and in vitro. These findings suggest a novel role for L1 in nerve regeneration. We propose that L1 negatively regulates Schwann cell proliferation after nerve damage, which in turn restricts functional recovery by limiting the trophic support for regenerating motoneurons.

70449704590	Modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity by cell adhesion and repulsion molecules	Adhesive and repellent molecular cues guide migrating cells and growing neurites during development. They also contribute to synaptic function, learning and memory in adulthood. Here, we review the roles of cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Ig-CAMs) and semaphorins (some of which also contain Ig-like domains) in regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Interestingly, among the seven studied Ig-CAMs, the neuronal cell adhesion molecule proved to be important for all tested forms of hippocampal plasticity, while its associated unusual glycan polysialic acid is necessary and sufficient part for synaptic plasticity only at CA3-CA1 synapses. In contrast, Thy-1 and L1 specifically regulate long-term potentiation (LTP) at synapses formed by entorhinal axons in the dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis, respectively. Contactin-1 is important for long-term depression but not for LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses. Analysis of CHL1-deficient mice illustrates that at intermediate stages of development a deficit in a cell adhesion molecule is compensated but appears as impaired LTP during early and late postnatal development. The emerging mechanisms by which adhesive Ig-CAMs contribute to synaptic plasticity involve regulation of activities of NMDA receptors and L-type Ca

71849115361	Genetic ablation of tenascin-C expression leads to abnormal hippocampal CA1 structure and electrical activity in vivo	Despite evidence that the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C (TNC) is implicated in brain development and plasticity, its roles in the intact adult brain are unknown. Here we report that spontaneous local field potential (LFP) activity in freely moving adult TNC-deficient mice is abnormal. The power of cortical and hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations was enhanced in comparison to wild-type mice. The alteration in hippocampal gamma rhythm was subfield specific, such that CA1 gamma was accentuated while dentate gyrus gamma was normal. Similar to LFP, synaptic transmission and plasticity at perforant path synapses in the dentate gyrus were unaffected by the mutation. Morphological analyses revealed a subfield-specific reduction in the CA1 volume and a reduction in the numbers of somatostatin-positive interneurons in the hippocampus as potential structural substrates of the observed functional aberrations. These findings indicate a role for tenascin-C in structural organization of the CA1 hippocampal subfield and in shaping neural activity. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

74149085453	Polysialic acid glycomimetic promotes functional recovery and plasticity after spinal cord injury in mice	Regeneration after injury of the central nervous system is poor due to the abundance of molecules inhibiting axonal growth. Here we pursued to promote regeneration after thoracic spinal cord injury in young adult C57BL/6J mice using peptides which functionally mimic polysialic acid (PSA) and human natural killer cell-1 (HNK-1) glycan, carbohydrate epitopes known to promote neurite outgrowth in vitro. Subdural infusions were performed with an osmotic pump, over 2 weeks. When applied immediately after injury, the PSA mimetic and the combination of PSA and HNK-1 mimetics, but not the HNK-1 mimetic alone, improved functional recovery as assessed by locomotor rating and video-based motion analysis over a 6-week observation period. Better outcome in PSA mimetic-treated mice was associated with higher, as compared with control mice, numbers of cholinergic and glutamatergic terminals and monaminergic axons in the lumbar spinal cord, and better axonal myelination proximal to the injury site. In contrast to immediate post-traumatic application, the PSA mimetic treatment was ineffective when initiated 3 weeks after spinal cord injury. Our data suggest that PSA mimetic peptides can be efficient therapeutic tools improving, by augmenting plasticity, functional recovery when applied during the acute phase of spinal cord injury. © 2010 The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy.

74249090635	Embryonic stem cell-derived L1 overexpressing neural aggregates enhance recovery in Parkinsonian mice	Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, after Alzheimer's disease, and the most common movement disorder. Drug treatment and deep brain stimulation can ameliorate symptoms, but the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra eventually leads to severe motor dysfunction. The transplantation of stem cells has emerged as a promising approach to replace lost neurons in order to restore dopamine levels in the striatum and reactivate functional circuits. We have generated substrate-adherent embryonic stem cell-derived neural aggregates overexpressing the neural cell adhesion molecule L1, because it has shown beneficial functions after central nervous system injury. L1 enhances neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration, differentiation and survival as well as myelination. In a previous study, L1 was shown to enhance functional recovery in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. In another study, a new differentiation protocol for murine embryonic stem cells was established allowing the transplantation of stem cell-derived neural aggregates consisting of differentiated neurons and radial glial cells into the lesioned brain. In the present study, this embryonic stem cell line was engineered to overexpress L1 constitutively at all stages of differentiation and used to generate stem cell-derived neural aggregates. These were monitored in their effects on stem cell survival and differentiation, rescue of endogenous dopaminergic neurons and ability to influence functional recovery after transplantation in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. Female C57BL/6J mice (2 months old) were treated with the mitochondrial toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine intraperitoneally to deplete dopaminergic neurons selectively, followed by unilateral transplantation of stem cell-derived neural aggregates into the striatum. Mice grafted with L1 overexpressing stem cell-derived neural aggregates showed better functional recovery when compared to mice transplanted with wild-type stem cell-derived neural aggregates and vehicle-injected mice. Morphological analysis revealed increased numbers and migration of surviving transplanted cells, as well as increased numbers of dopaminergic neurons, leading to enhanced levels of dopamine in the striatum ipsilateral to the grafted side in L1 overexpressing stem cell-derived neural aggregates, when compared to wild-type stem cell-derived neural aggregates. The striatal levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid were not affected by L1 overexpressing stem cell-derived neural aggregates. Furthermore, L1 overexpressing, but not wild-type stem cell-derived neural aggregates, enhanced survival of endogenous host dopaminergic neurons after transplantation adjacent to the substantia nigra pars compacta. Thus, L1 overexpressing stem cell-derived neural aggregates enhance survival and migration of transplanted cells, differentiation into dopaminergic neurons, survival of endogenous dopaminergic neurons, and functional recovery after syngeneic transplantation in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model of Parkinson's disease.

74549155695	Nuclear factor I-A represses expression of the cell adhesion molecule L1	Background: The neural cell adhesion molecule L1 plays a crucial role in development and plasticity of the nervous system. Neural cells thus require precise control of L1 expression.Results: We identified a full binding site for nuclear factor I (NFI) transcription factors in the regulatory region of the mouse L1 gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed binding of nuclear factor I-A (NFI-A) to this site. Moreover, for a brain-specific isoform of NFI-A (NFI-A bs), we confirmed the interaction in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Reporter gene assays showed that in neuroblastoma cells, overexpression of NFI-A bs repressed L1 expression threefold.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that NFI-A, in particular its brain-specific isoform, represses L1 gene expression, and might act as a second silencer of L1 in addition to the neural restrictive silencer factor (NRSF). © 2009 Schneegans et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77953511814	Short DNA sequences inserted for gene targeting can accidentally interfere with off-target gene expression	Targeting of genes in mice, a key approach to study development and disease, often leaves a neo cassette, loxP, or FRT sites inserted in the mouse genome. Insertion of neo can influence the expression of neighboring genes, but similar effects have not been reported for loxP sites. We therefore performed micro-array analyses of mice in which the Ncam or the Tnr gene were targeted either by insertion of neo or loxP/ FRT sites. In the case of Ncam, neo, but not loxP/FRT insertion, led to a 2-fold reduction in mRNA levels of 3 genes located at distances between 0.2 and 3.1 Mb from the target. In contrast, after introduction of loxP/FRT sites into introns of Tnr, we observed a 2.5- to 4-fold reduction in the transcript level of the Gas5 gene, 1.1 Mb away from Tnr, most probably due to disruption of a conserved regulatory element in Tnr. Insertion of short DNA sequences such as loxP/FRT can thus influence off-target mRNA levels if these sites are accidentally placed into regulatory elements. Our results imply that conditional knockout mice should be analyzed for genomic positional side effects that may influence the animals' phenotypes. © FASEB.

77952969357	A novel motion analysis approach reveals late recovery in C57BL/6 mice and deficits in NCAM-deficient mice after sciatic nerve crush	Assessment of motor abilities after sciatic nerve injury in rodents, in particular mice, relies exclusively on walking track (footprint) analysis despite known limitations of this method. Using principles employed recently for video-based motion analyses after femoral nerve and spinal cord injuries, we have designed and report here a novel approach for functional assessments after sciatic nerve lesions in mice. Functional deficits are estimated by angle and distance measurements on single video frames recorded during beam-walking and inclined ladder climbing. Analyses of adult C57BL/6J mice after crush of the sciatic, tibial, or peroneal nerve allowed the identification of six numerical parameters, detecting impairments of the plantar flexion of the foot and the toe spread. Some of these parameters, as well as footprint functional indices, revealed severe impairment after crush injury of the sciatic or tibial, but not the peroneal nerve, and complete recovery within 3 weeks after lesion. Other novel estimates, however, showed that complete recovery is reached as late as 2-3 months after sciatic nerve crush. These measures detected both tibial and peroneal dysfunction. In contrast to the complete restoration of function in wild-type mice (100%), our new parameters, in contrast to the sciatic functional index, showed incomplete recovery (85%) 90 days after sciatic nerve crush in mice deficient in the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). We conclude that the novel video-based approach is more precise, sensitive, and versatile than established tests, allowing objective numerical assessment of different motor functions in a sciatic nerve injury paradigm in mice. © Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2010.

77956505318	Binding of the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB to the Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM) regulates phosphorylation of NCAM and NCAM-dependent neurite outgrowth	Recognition molecules and neurotrophins play important roles during development and maintenance of nervous system functions. In this study, we provide evidence that the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and the neurotrophin receptor TrkB directly interact via sequences in their intracellular domains. Stimulation of TrkB by brain-derived neurotrophic factor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of NCAM at position 734. Mutation of this tyrosine to phenylalanine completely abolishes tyrosine phosphorylation of NCAM by TrkB. Moreover, the knockdown of TrkB in hippocampal neurons leads to a reduction of NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth. Transfection of NCAM-deficient hippocampal neurons with mutated NCAM carrying an exchange of tyrosine by phenylalanine at position 734 leads to promotion of NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth in comparison with that observed after transfection with wild-type NCAM, whereas a reduction of neurite outgrowth was observed after transfection with mutated NCAM, which carries an exchange of tyrosine by glutamate that mimics the phosphorylated tyrosine. Our observations indicate a functional relationship between TrkB and NCAM. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

77956827140	Expression of the snoRNA host gene gas5 in the hippocampus is upregulated by age and psychogenic stress and correlates with reduced novelty-induced behavior in C57BL/6 mice	The growth arrest specific 5 (gas5) is a noncoding protein gene that hosts small nucleolar RNAs. Based on the observation that gas5 RNA level in the brain is highest in the hippocampus and remarkably enhanced in aged mice, we tested the hypothesis that gas5 is involved in functions controlled by the hippocampus and known to be affected by age, such as spatial learning and novelty-induced behaviors. We show that aged (22-month-old) C57BL/6 male mice have spatial-learning impairments, reduced novelty-induced exploration, and enhanced gas5 RNA levels in the hippocampus compared to young (3-month-old) mice. At both ages, levels of gas5 RNA in the hippocampus negatively correlated with novelty-induced exploration in the open field and elevated-plus maze tests. No correlations were found between gas5 RNA levels in the hippocampus and performance in the water maze test. The expression of gas5 RNA in the rest of the brain did not correlate with any behavioral parameter analyzed. Because variations in novelty-induced behaviors could be caused by stressfull experiences, we analyzed whether gas5 RNA levels in the hippocampus are regulated by acute stressors. We found that gas5 RNA levels in the hippocampus were upregulated by 50% 24 h after a psychogenic stressor (60-min olfactory contact with a rat) but were unchanged after exposure to an unfamiliar environment or after acquisition of new spatial information in a one-trial learning task. The present results suggest that strong psychogenic stressors upregulate gas5 RNA in the hippocampus, which in turn affects novelty-induced responses controlled by this region. We hypothesize that long-life exposure to stressors causes an age-dependent increase in hippocampal gas5 RNA levels, which could be responsible for age-related reduced novelty-induced behaviors, thus suggesting a new mechanism by which ageing and stress affect hippocampal function. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77957765862	CHL1 is a selective organizer of the presynaptic machinery chaperoning the SNARE complex	Proteins constituting the presynaptic machinery of vesicle release undergo substantial conformational changes during the process of exocytosis. While changes in the conformation make proteins vulnerable to aggregation and degradation, little is known about synaptic chaperones which counteract these processes. We show that the cell adhesion molecule CHL1 directly interacts with and regulates the activity of the synaptic chaperones Hsc70, CSP and αSGT. CHL1, Hsc70, CSP and αSGT form predominantly CHL1/Hsc70/aSGT and CHL1/CSP complexes in synapses. Among the various complexes formed by CHL1, Hsc70, CSP and αSGT, SNAP25 and VAMP2 induce chaperone activity only in CHL1/Hsc70/αSGT and CHL1/CSP complexes, respectively, indicating a remarkable selectivity of a presynaptic chaperone activity for proteins of the exocytotic machinery. In mice with genetic ablation of CHL1, chaperone activity in synapses is reduced and the machinery for synaptic vesicle exocytosis and, in particular, the SNARE complex is unable to sustain prolonged synaptic activity. Thus, we reveal a novel role for a cell adhesion molecule in selective activation of the presynaptic chaperone machinery. © 2010 Andreyeva et al.

78650908663	CHL1 negatively regulates the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells through activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway	Neural recognition molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily play important roles in the development and regeneration of nervous system. Close Homologue of L1 (CHL1) is a member of the L1 family of recognition molecules which are expressed during neuronal development, suggesting a potential role in neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we investigated the role of CHL1 in the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs both in vivo and in vitro, and the possible mechanism involved. The number of BrdU-positive cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) significantly increased in CHL1-/- mice compared with CHL1+/+ mice. Moreover, there were more Tuj1-positive cells in the cortical plate region in CHL1-/- mice than in CHL1+/+ controls. To further examine the function of CHL1 in the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs, NPCs from CHL1-/- mice versus littermate wild-type mice were isolated and cultured in vitro. NPCs derived from CHL1-/- mice showed increased proliferation and self-renewal ability compared with CHL1+/+ mice. In the course of differentiation, CHL1 deficiency enhanced neuronal differentiation in the absence of growth factors. Furthermore, CHL1 deficiency on the proliferation of NPCs is accompanied by means of enhanced activation of ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the inhibitor of ERK1/2 MAPK eliminates the effect of CHL1 deficiency on the proliferation of NPCs. Our results first describe the negative modulation of the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NPCs by CHL1/ERK1/2 MAPK signaling. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

78650719879	Transcription factor Sox11b is involved in spinal cord regeneration in adult zebrafish	Adult zebrafish have the ability to recover from spinal cord injury and exhibit re-growth of descending axons from the brainstem to the spinal cord. We performed gene expression analysis using microarray to find damage-induced genes after spinal cord injury, and found that Sox11b mRNA is up-regulated at 11 days after injury. However, the functional relevance of Sox11b for regeneration is not known. Here, we report that the up-regulation of Sox11b mRNA after spinal cord injury is mainly localized in ependymal cells lining the central canal and in newly differentiating neuronal precursors or immature neurons. Using an in vivo morpholino-based gene knockout approach, we demonstrate that Sox11b is essential for locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury. In the injured spinal cord, expression of the neural stem cell associated gene Nestin, and the proneural gene Ascl1a (Mash1a), which are involved in the self-renewal and cell fate specification of endogenous neural stem cells, respectively, is regulated by Sox11b. Our data indicate that Sox11b promotes neuronal determination of endogenous stem cells and regenerative neurogenesis following spinal cord injury in the adult zebrafish. Enhancing Sox11b expression to promote proliferation and neurogenic determination of endogenous neural stem cells after injury may be a promising strategy in restorative therapy after spinal cord injury in mammals. © 2011.

0036397986	Fibronectin domains of extracellular matrix molecule tenascin-C modulate hippocampal learning and synaptic plasticity	The extracellular matrix molecule tenascin-C (TN-C) has been shown to be involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity in vitro. Here, we describe a deficit in hippocampus-dependent contextual memory in TN-C-deficient mice using the step-down avoidance paradigm. We further show that a fragment of TN-C containing the fibronectin type-III repeats 6-8 (FN6-8), but not a fragment containing repeats 3-5, bound to pyramidal and granule cell somata in the hippocampal formation of C57BL/6J mice and repelled axons of pyramidal neurons when presented as a border in vitro. Injection of the FN6-8 fragment into the hippocampus inhibited retention of memory in the step-down paradigm and reduced levels of long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In summary, our data show that TN-C is involved in hippocampus-dependent contextual memory and synaptic plasticity and identify the FN6-8 domain as one of molecular determinants mediating these functions.

79960501849	Glycomimetic improves recovery after femoral injury in a non-human primate	In adult mammals, restoration of function after peripheral nerve injury is often poor and effective therapies are not available. Previously we have shown in mice that a peptide which functionally mimics the human natural killer cell (HNK)-1 trisaccharide epitope significantly improves the outcome of femoral nerve injury. Here we evaluated the translational potential of this treatment using primates. We applied a linear HNK-1 mimetic or a functionally inactive control peptide in silicone cuffs used to reconstruct the cut femoral nerves of adult cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Functional recovery was evaluated using video-based gait analysis over a 160-day observation period. The final outcome was further assessed using force measurements, H-reflex recordings, nerve histology, and ELISA to assess immunoreactivity to HNK-1 in the treated monkeys. Gait deficits were significantly reduced in HNK-1 mimetic-treated compared with control peptide-treated animals between 60 and 160 days after injury. Better outcome at 160 days after surgery in treated versus control animals was also confirmed by improved quadriceps muscle force, enhanced H-reflex amplitude, decreased H-reflex latency, and larger diameters of regenerated axons. No adverse reactions to the mimetic, in particular immune responses resulting in antibodies against the HNK-1 mimetic or immune cell infiltration into the damaged nerve, were observed. These results indicate the potential of the HNK-1 mimetic as an efficient, feasible, and safe adjunct treatment for nerve injuries requiring surgical repair in clinical settings. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

Our study demonstrates that AAV5 is more effective than AAV2 for delivering genes into the injured spinal cord tissue.

80054814239	Transplanted L1 expressing radial glia and astrocytes enhance recovery after spinal cord injury	A major obstacle for the transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into the lesioned spinal cord is their predominant astrocytic differentiation after transplantation. We took advantage of this predominant astrocytic differentiation of NSCs and expressed the paradigmatic beneficial neural cell adhesion molecule L1 in radial glial cells and reactive and nonreactive astrocytes as novel cellular vehicles to express L1 under the control of the promoter for the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP-L1 NSCs). Behavioral analysis and electrophysiological H-reflex recordings revealed that mice transplanted with GFAP-L1 NSCs showed enhanced locomotor recovery in comparison to mice injected with wild type (WT) NSCs or control mice injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). This functional recovery was further accelerated in mice transplanted with L1-expressing radial glial cells that had been immunoisolated from GFAP-L1 NSCs (GFAP-L1-i cells). Morphological analysis revealed that mice grafted with GFAP-L1 NSCs exhibited increased neuronal differentiation and migration of transplanted cells, as well as increased soma size and cholinergic synaptic coverage of host motoneurons and increased numbers of endogenous catecholaminergic nerve fibers caudal to the lesion site. These findings show that L1-expressing astrocytes and radial glial cells isolated from GFAP-L1 NSC cultures represent a novel strategy for improving functional recovery after spinal cord injury, encouraging the use of the human GFAP promoter to target beneficial transgene expression in transplanted stem cells. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

81255195528	CRP1, a protein localized in filopodia of growth cones, is involved in dendritic growth	The cysteine-rich protein (CRP) family is a subgroup of LIM domain proteins. CRP1, which cross-links actin filaments to make actin bundles, is the onlyCRPfamily member expressed in the CNS with little known about its function in nerve cells. Here, we report that CRP1 colocalizes with actin in the filopodia of growth cones in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of CRP1 expression by short hairpinRNAinterference results in inhibition of filopodia formation and dendritic growth in neurons. Overexpression of CRP1 increases filopodia formation and neurite branching, which require its actin-bundling activity. Expression ofCRP1with a constitutively active form of Cdc42, a GTPase involved in filopodia formation, increases filopodia formation in COS-7 cells, suggesting cooperation between the two proteins.

84858033841	The interaction between cell adhesion molecule L1, matrix metalloproteinase 14, and adenine nucleotide translocator at the plasma membrane regulates L1-mediated neurite outgrowth of murine cerebellar neurons	We have identified the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) isoforms ANT1 and ANT2 that are present in the plasma membrane of mouse cerebellar neurons as novel binding partners of the cell adhesion molecule L1. The direct interaction between ANT and L1 is mediated by sites within the fibronectin type III domains of L1 and the first and third extracellular loops of the ANT proteins. We also show that L1 interacts with the ANT binding partner matrix metalloprotease 14 (MMP14) and that the ANT proteins bind directly to the L1 interaction partner glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Moreover, we provide evidence that the functional interplay between L1, ANT proteins, MMP14, and GAPDH at the plasma membrane mediates L1-induced neurite outgrowth of cerebellar neurons. Disruption of this interplay by ANT inhibitors, ANT-derived synthetic peptides, and/or function-blocking MMP14 and ANT antibodies leads to alterations in L1-dependent neurite outgrowth. Stimulation of L1-mediated signaling in cerebellar neurons triggers transient ATP secretion via ANT proteins and leads to transient src family-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of L1, ANT1, ANT2, and MMP14. Thus, our results indicate that plasma membrane-localized ANT1 and ANT2 regulate L1-mediated neurite outgrowth in conjunction with MMP14. © 2012 the authors.

84856798816	Neurite outgrowth triggered by the cell adhesion molecule L1 requires activation and inactivation of the cytoskeletal protein cofilin	Neurite outgrowth, an essential process for constructing nervous system connectivity, requires molecular cues which promote neurite extension and guide growing neurites. The neural cell adhesion molecule L1 is one of the molecules involved in this process. Growth of neurites depends on actin remodeling, but actin-remodeling proteins which act downstream of L1 signaling are not known. In this study, we investigated whether the actin-remodeling protein cofilin, which can be activated by dephosphorylation, is involved in neurite outgrowth stimulated by L1. Upon stimulation with an L1 monoclonal antibody which specifically triggers L1-dependent neurite outgrowth, cofilin phosphorylation in cultured cerebellar granule neurons and isolated growth cones was reduced to 47 ± 13% or 58 ± 9% of IgG control levels, respectively. We therefore investigated whether cofilin phosphorylation plays a role in L1-stimulated neurite outgrowth. Inhibition of calcineurin, a phosphatase acting upstream of cofilin dephosphorylation, impaired L1-dependent neurite extension in cultures of cerebellar granule neurons and led to an increase in cofilin phosphorylation. Moreover, when peptide S3, a competitive inhibitor of cofilin phosphorylation, or peptide pS3, a competitive inhibitor of cofilin dephosphorylation, were transferred into cerebellar neurons in culture, L1-stimulated neurite outgrowth was reduced from 173 ± 15% to 103 ± 4% of poly-l-lysine control levels in the presence of either peptide. Our findings suggest that both activation of cofilin by dephosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin by phosphorylation are essential for L1-stimulated neurite outgrowth. These results are in accordance with a cofilin activity cycle recently proposed for invasive tumor cells and inflammatory cells, indicating that a similar regulatory mechanism might be involved in neurite outgrowth. As L1 is expressed by invasive tumor cells, cofilin might also be a downstream actor of L1 in metastasis. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

84856947145	Dermatan sulfotransferase Chst14/d4st1, but not chondroitin sulfotransferase Chst11/C4st1, regulates proliferation and neurogenesis of neural progenitor cells	Chondroitin sulfates (CSs) and dermatan sulfates (DSs) are enriched in the microenvironment of neural stem cells (NSCs) during development and in the adult neurogenic niche, and have been implicated in mechanisms governing neural precursor migration, proliferation and differentiation. In contrast to previous studies, in which a chondroitinaseABC-dependent unselective deglycosylation of both CSs and DSs was performed, we used chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (Chst11/C4st1)- and dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (Chst14/D4st1)-deficient NSCs specific for CSs and DSs, respectively, to investigate the involvement of specific sulfation profiles of CS and DS chains, and thus the potentially distinct roles of CSs and DSs in NSC biology. In comparison to wild-type controls, deficiency for Chst14 resulted in decreased neurogenesis and diminished proliferation of NSCs accompanied by increased expression of GLAST and decreased expression of Mash-1, and an upregulation of the expression of the receptors for fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). By contrast, deficiency in Chst11 did not influence NSC proliferation, migration or differentiation. These observations indicate for the first time that CSs and DSs play distinct roles in the self-renewal and differentiation of NSCs. © 2011.

In this study, we addressed the question whether the differential functional outcome was paralleled by differences in blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) repair in the two mouse strains. We conducted spinal cord compression injuries in knock-out and wild-type mice. BSCB permeability was assessed by measuring the Evans blue spread within the spinal cord tissue at 14-21 days after injury.

84862516088	Adhesion molecule L1 is down-regulated in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors versus benign neurofibromatosis type 1-associated tumors	Type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF-1), also known as von Recklinghausen disease, is caused by a disorder of a single gene on chromosome 17 that usually restrains cell division. A sequence that is frequently associated with NF-1 is tumor progression from neurofibromas to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). The aim of this study was to determine the expression of the neural L1 cell adhesion molecule in dermal-diffuse neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas, and MPNSTs of NF-1. We retrospectively analyzed surgically resected primary tumors, including 20 dermal neurofibromas, 23 plexiform neurofibromas, and 17 MPNSTs, by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections of NF-1 tumors with the use of the L1-specific monoclonal antibody UJ127, which does not cross-react with other members of the L1 family. Immunostainings for CD34 and S100 were included to distinguish and allocate L1-expressing Schwann cells and perineural (specialized) fibroblasts. Our data showed that L1 is highly expressed in all benign NF-1 tumors and in some but not all MPNSTs. Furthermore, we demonstrated a correlation between L1 expression and differentiation grade of MPNSTs. There was a significant trend toward lower or nondetectable expression in the poorly differentiated MPNSTs, in contrast to all other tumor entities so far investigated, in which L1 expression correlated positive with malignancy, except for juvenile but not adult-derived neuroblastomas. Future studies are warranted to elucidate the molecular basis of the varying effects of the degree of L1 expression, receptor, and signal transduction mechanisms in different tumors. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84863044855	Cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 1a is involved in spinal cord regeneration in adult zebrafish	In contrast to mammals, adult zebrafish have the ability to regrow descending axons and gain locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). In zebrafish, a decisive factor for successful spinal cord regeneration is the inherent ability of some neurons to regrow their axons via (re)expressing growth-associated genes during the regeneration period. The nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle (NMLF) is one of the nuclei capable of regenerative response after SCI. Using microarray analysis with laser capture microdissected NMLF, we show that cysteine- and glycine-rich protein (CRP)1a (encoded by the csrp1a gene in zebrafish), the function of which is largely unknown in the nervous system, was upregulated after SCI. In situ hybridization confirmed the upregulation of csrp1a expression in neurons during the axon growth phase after SCI, not only in the NMLF, but also in other nuclei capable of regeneration, such as the intermediate reticular formation and superior reticular formation. The upregulation of csrp1a expression in regenerating nuclei started at 3days after SCI and continued to 21days post-injury, the longest time point studied. In vivo knockdown of CRP1a expression using two different antisense morpholino oligonucleotides impaired axon regeneration and locomotor recovery when compared with a control morpholino, demonstrating that CRP1a upregulation is an important part of the innate regeneration capability in injured neurons of adult zebrafish. This study is the first to demonstrate the requirement of CRP1a for zebrafish spinal cord regeneration. © 2012 The Authors.

84863780137	The cell adhesion molecule L1 regulates the expression of choline acetyltransferase and the development of septal cholinergic neurons	Mutations in the L1 gene cause severe brain malformations and mental retardation. We investigated the potential roles of L1 in the regulation of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and in the development of septal cholinergic neurons, which are known to project to the hippocampus and play key roles in cognitive functions. Using stereological approaches, we detected significantly fewer ChAT-positive cholinergic neurons in the medial septum and vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (MS/VDB) of 2-week-old L1-deficient mice compared to wild-type littermates (1644 ± 137 vs. 2051 ± 165, P = 0.038). ChAT protein levels in the septum were 53% lower in 2-week-old L1-deficient mice compared to wild-type littermates. ChAT activity in the septum was significantly reduced in L1-deficient mice compared to wild-type littermates at 1 (34%) and 2 (40%) weeks of age. In vitro, increasing doses of L1-Fc induced ChAT activity in septal neurons with a significant linear trend (*P = 0.0065). At 4 weeks of age in the septum and at all time points investigated in the caudate-putamen (CPu), the number of ChAT-positive neurons and the levels of ChAT activity were not statistically different between L1-deficient mice and wild-type littermates. The total number of cells positive for the neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) in the MS/VDB and CPu was not statistically different in L1-deficient mice compared to wild-type littermates, and comparable expression of the cell cycle marker Ki67 was observed. Our results indicate that L1 is required for the timely maturation of septal cholinergic neurons and that L1 promotes the expression and activity of ChAT in septal neurons. © 2011 The Authors.

84863802603	Delayed applications of L1 and chondroitinase ABC promote recovery after spinal cord injury	The inhibitory environment of the injured spinal cord is an obstacle to functional recovery and axonal regeneration in adult mammals. We had previously shown that injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding the L1 cell adhesion molecule (AAV-L1) at the time of acute thoracic compression injury of adult mice promotes locomotor recovery, which is associated with ameliorated astrogliosis and improved axonal regeneration in the lumbar spinal cord. In the present study, we investigated whether delayed injection of AAV-L1, chondroitinase ABC (Chase), or the combination of the two agents into the mouse spinal cord 3 weeks after injury would also lead to improved recovery. The Basso Mouse Scale showed enhanced locomotor recovery 12 weeks after application of the agents in all treatment groups compared to the control group that was injected with AAV encoding green fluorescent protein (AAV-GFP). Investigation of hindlimb function using single-frame motion analysis revealed, however, that L1 overexpression, but not injection of Chase, improved voluntary movements without body weight support, whereas injection of Chase, but not L1 overexpression, enhanced body weight support during stepping. Mice with the combined application of AAV-L1 and Chase showed improvement in both parameters. Enhanced motor recovery after combined application correlated with increased densities of cholinergic and GABAergic terminals at motoneuronal cell bodies, and of lamina-specific glutamatergic sensory afferents 15 weeks after injury, indicating enhanced synaptic rearrangements in the lumbar spinal cord below the lesion site. These findings suggest that L1 overexpression combined with Chase application may contribute to the treatment of sub-chronic spinal cord injury. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84864809938	Improved regeneration after spinal cord injury in mice lacking functional T- and B-lymphocytes	It is widely accepted that the immune system plays important functional roles in regeneration after injury to the spinal cord. Immune response towards injury involves a complex interplay of immune system cells, such as neutrophils, macrophages and microglia, T- and B-lymphocytes. We investigated the influence of the lymphocyte component of the immune system on the locomotor outcome of severe spinal cord injury in a genetic mouse model of immune suppression. Transgenic mice lacking mature T- and B-lymphocytes due to the recombination activating gene 2 gene deletion (RAG2-/- mice) were subjected to severe compression of the lower thoracic spinal cord, with the wild-type mice of the same inbred background serving as controls. According to both the Basso Mouse Scale score and single frame motion analysis, the RAG2-/- mice showed improved recovery in comparison to control mice at six weeks after injury. Better locomotor function was associated with enhanced catecholaminergic and cholinergic reinnervation of the spinal cord caudal to injury and increased axonal regrowth/sprouting at the site of injury. Myelination of axons in the ventral column measured as g-ratio was more extensive in RAG2-/- than in control mice 6. weeks after injury. Additionally, the number of microglia/macrophages was decreased in the lumbar spinal cord of RAG2-/- mice after injury, whereas the number of astrocytes was increased compared with controls. We conclude that T- and B-lymphocytes restrict functional recovery from spinal cord injury by increasing numbers of microglia/macrophages as well as decreasing axonal sprouting and myelination. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84866143296	The effect of glycomimetic functionalized collagen on peripheral nerve repair	Increasing evidence suggests that the improper synaptic reconnection of regenerating axons is a significant cause of incomplete functional recovery following peripheral nerve injury. In this study, we evaluate the use of collagen hydrogels functionalized with two peptide glycomimetics of naturally occurring carbohydrates-polysialic acid (PSA) and human natural killer cell epitope epitope (HNK-1)-that have been independently shown to encourage nerve regeneration and axonal targeting. Our novel biomaterial was used to bridge a critical gap size (5 mm) in a mouse femoral nerve injury model. Functional recovery was assessed using gait and hind limb extension, and was significantly better in all glycomimetic peptide-coupled collagen conditions versus non-functional scrambled peptide-coupled collagen, native collagen, and saline controls. Analysis of cross-sections of the regenerated nerve demonstrated that hydrogels coupled with the PSA glycomimetic, but not HNK, had significant increases in the number of myelinated axons over controls. Conversely, hydrogels coupled with HNK, but not PSA, showed improvement in myelination. Additionally, significantly more correctly projecting motoneurons were observed in groups containing coupled HNK-1 mimicking peptide, but not PSA mimicking peptide. Given the distinct morphological outcomes between the two glycomimetics, our study indicates that the enhancement of recovery following peripheral nerve injury induced by PSA- and HNK-functionalized collagen hydrogels likely occurs through distinct mechanisms. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84866843572	A Surgery Protocol for Adult Zebrafish Spinal Cord Injury	Adult zebrafish has a remarkable capability to recover from spinal cord injury, providing an excellent model for studying neuroregeneration. Here we list equipment and reagents, and give a detailed protocol for complete transection of the adult zebrafish spinal cord. In this protocol, potential problems and their solutions are described so that the zebrafish spinal cord injury model can be more easily and reproducibly performed. In addition, two assessments are introduced to monitor the success of the surgery and functional recovery: one test to assess free swimming capability and the other test to assess extent of neuroregeneration by in vivo anterograde axonal tracing. In the swimming behavior test, successful complete spinal cord transection is monitored by the inability of zebrafish to swim freely for 1 week after spinal cord injury, followed by the gradual reacquisition of full locomotor ability within 6 weeks after injury. As a morphometric correlate, anterograde axonal tracing allows the investigator to monitor the ability of regenerated axons to cross the lesion site and increasingly extend into the gray and white matter with time after injury, confirming functional recovery. This zebrafish model provides a paradigm for recovery from spinal cord injury, enabling the identification of pathways and components of neuroregeneration. © 2012.

84867626931	In vitro generation of three-dimensional substrate-adherent embryonic stem cell-derived neural aggregates for application in animal models of neurological disorders	In vitro-differentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells comprise a useful source for cell replacement therapy, but the efficiency and safety of a translational approach are highly dependent on optimized protocols for directed differentiation of ES cells into the desired cell types in vitro. Furthermore, the transplantation of three-dimensional ES cell-derived structures instead of a single-cell suspension may improve graft survival and function by providing a beneficial microenvironment for implanted cells. To this end, we have developed a new method to efficiently differentiate mouse ES cells into neural aggregates that consist predominantly (>90%) of postmitotic neurons, neural progenitor cells, and radial glia-like cells. When transplanted into the excitotoxically lesioned striatum of adult mice, these substrate-adherent embryonic stem cell-derived neural aggregates (SENAs) showed significant advantages over transplanted single-cell suspensions of ES cell-derived neural cells, including improved survival of GABAergic neurons, increased cell migration, and significantly decreased risk of teratoma formation. Furthermore, SENAs mediated functional improvement after transplantation into animal models of Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injury. This unit describes in detail how SENAs are efficiently derived from mouse ES cells in vitro and how SENAs are isolated for transplantation. Furthermore, methods are presented for successful implantation of SENAs into animal models of Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and spinal cord injury to study the effects of stem cell-derived neural aggregates in a disease context in vivo.

84871326648	Antibody Fragments Directed against Different Portions of the Human Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1 Act as Inhibitors or Activators of L1 Function	The neural cell adhesion molecule L1 plays important roles in neuronal migration and survival, neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis. L1 has also been found in tumors of different origins, with levels of L1 expression correlating positively with the metastatic potential of tumors. To select antibodies targeting the varied functions of L1, we screened the Tomlinson library of recombinant human antibody fragments to identify antibodies binding to recombinant human L1 protein comprising the entire extracellular domain of human L1. We obtained four L1 binding single-chain variable fragment antibodies (scFvs), named I4, I6, I13, and I27 and showed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that scFvs I4 and I6 have high affinity to the immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains 1-4 of L1, while scFvs I13 and I27 bind strongly to the fibronectin type III homologous (Fn) domains 1-3 of L1. Application of scFvs I4 and I6 to human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells reduced proliferation and transmigration of these cells. Treatment of SK-N-SH cells with scFvs I13 and I27 enhanced cell proliferation and migration, neurite outgrowth, and protected against the toxic effects of H

84871352310	The Cell Neural Adhesion Molecule Contactin-2 (TAG-1) Is Beneficial for Functional Recovery after Spinal Cord Injury in Adult Zebrafish	The cell neural adhesion molecule contactin-2 plays a key role in axon extension and guidance, fasciculation, and myelination during development. We thus asked, whether contactin-2 is also important in nervous system regeneration after trauma. In this study, we used an adult zebrafish spinal cord transection model to test the functions of contactin-2 in spinal cord regeneration. The expression patterns of contactin-2 at different time points after spinal cord injury were studied at the mRNA level by qPCR and in situ hybridization, and contactin-2 protein levels and immunohistological localization were detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, respectively. Contactin-2 mRNA and protein levels were increased along the central canal at 6 days and 11 days after spinal cord injury, suggesting a requirement for contactin-2 in spinal cord regeneration. Co-localization of contactin-2 and islet-1 (a motoneuron marker) was observed in spinal cords before and after injury. To further explore the functions of contactin-2 in regeneration, an anti-sense morpholino was used to knock down the expression of contactin-2 protein by application at the time of injury. Motion analysis showed that inhibition of contactin-2 retarded the recovery of swimming functions when compared to standard control morpholino. Anterograde and retrograde tracing at 6 weeks after injury showed that knock down of contactin-2 inhibited axonal regrowth from NMLF neurons beyond lesion site. The combined observations indicate that contactin-2 contributes to locomotor recovery and successful regrowth of axons after spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish. © 2012 Lin et al.

84871790544	Lipid raft-dependent endocytosis of close homolog of adhesion molecule L1 (CHL1) promotes neuritogenesis	CHL1 plays a dual role by either promoting or inhibiting neuritogenesis. We report here that neuritogenesis-promoting ligand-dependent cell surface clustering of CHL1 induces palmitoylation and lipid raft-dependent endocytosis of CHL1. We identify βII spectrin as a binding partner of CHL1, and we show that partial disruption of the complex between CHL1 and βII spectrin accompanies CHL1 endocytosis. Inhibition of the association of CHL1 with lipid rafts by pharmacological disruption of lipid rafts or by mutation of cysteine 1102 within the intracellular domain of CHL1 reduces endocytosis of CHL1. Endocytosis of CHL1 is also reduced by nifedipine, an inhibitor of the L-type voltage-dependent Ca

84872076906	The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) associates with and signals through p21-activated Kinase 1 (Pak1)	The Neural cell adhesion molecule(NCAM)playsanimportant role in regulation of nervous system development.Toexpandour understanding of the molecular mechanisms via which NCAM influences differentiation of neurons, we used a yeast two-hybrid screening to search for new binding partners of NCAM and identified p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1). We show that NCAM interacts with Pak1 in growth cones of neurons. The autophosphorylation and activity of Pak1 were enhanced when isolated growth cones were incubated with NCAM function triggering antibodies,whichmimicthe interactionbetweenNCAMandits extracellular ligands.Theassociation ofPak1withcellmembranes,the efficiency of Pak1 binding to its activators, and Pak1 activity were inhibited in brains of NCAM-deficient mice. NCAM-dependent Pak1 activation was abolished after lipid raft disruption, suggesting that NCAM promotes Pak1 activation in the lipid raft environment. Phosphorylation of the downstream Pak1 effectors LIMK1 and cofilin was reduced in growth cones from NCAM-deficient neurons, which was accompanied by decreased levels of filamentous actin and inhibited filopodium mobility in the growth cones. Dominant-negative Pak1 inhibited and constitutively active Pak1 enhanced the ability of neurons to increase neurite outgrowth in response to the extracellular ligands of NCAM. Our combined observations thus indicate thatNCAMactivates Pak1 to drive actin polymerization to promote neuronal differentiation. © 2013 the authors.

84872663809	Major vault protein promotes locomotor recovery and regeneration after spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish	In contrast to mammals, adult zebrafish recover locomotor functions after spinal cord injury (SCI), in part due to axonal regrowth and regeneration permissivity of the central nervous system. Upregulation of major vault protein (MVP) expression after spinal cord injury in the brainstem of the adult zebrafish prompted us to probe for its contribution to recovery after SCI. MVP is a multifunctional protein expressed not only in many types of tumours but also in the nervous system, where its importance for regeneration is, however, unclear. Using an established zebrafish SCI model, we found that MVP mRNA and protein expression levels were increased in ependymal cells in the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site at 6 and 11 days after SCI. Double immunolabelling showed that MVP was co-localised with Islet-1 or tyrosine hydroxylase around the central canal of the spinal cord in sham-injured control fish and injured fish 11 days after surgery. MVP co-localised with the neural stem cell marker nestin in ependymal cells after injury. By using an in vivo morpholino-based knock-down approach, we found that the distance moved by MVP morpholino-treated fish was reduced at 4, 5 and 6 weeks after SCI when compared to fish treated with standard control morpholino. Knock-down of MVP resulted in reduced regrowth of axons from brainstem neurons into the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site. These results indicate that MVP supports locomotor recovery and axonal regrowth after SCI in adult zebrafish. © 2012 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84874659140	Neuregulin 1 enhances cell adhesion molecule L1 expression in human glioma cells and promotes their migration as a function of malignancy	Similar functions of L1, a cell adhesion molecule, and the cytokine neuregulin 1 (Nrg1) have been suggested in tumorigenesis and the promotion of metastasis. We studied the relationships of Nrg1 and L1 expression in human gliomas. Using immunofluorescence staining on a human glioma tissue microarray, we found a positive correlation between levels of L1 and Nrg1α or Nrg1β expression; expression tended to increase with increasing WHO (World Health Organization) tumor grade. L1 was also found to colocalize with either Nrg1 isoform. In cultures of U87-MG human glioblastoma and human U251 and SHG-44 glioma cells, the base levels of full-length L1 expression were increased by the 2 Nrg1 molecules in the nanomolar range, and Nrg1 siRNA downregulated full-length L1 expression in these tumor cell lines. U87-MG cells treated with either Nrg1 isoform also showed enhanced migration when compared with that treated with vehicle control. In addition, administration of either lapatinib (a dual inhibitor of both the epidermal growth factor receptor and ErbB-2) or erlotinib (an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor) in combination with either Nrg1α or Nrg1β inhibited the L1 expression elicited by these cytokines in U87-MG cells. Together, our data suggest that Nrg1 regulates L1 expression in gliomas, and that Nrg1 may contribute to malignancy by upregulating the L1 expression in glioblastoma cells, thereby enhancing their migration. © 2013 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

84874776363	Arylsulfatase B Improves Locomotor Function after Mouse Spinal Cord Injury	Bacterial chondroitinase ABC (ChaseABC) has been used to remove the inhibitory chondroitin sulfate chains from chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans to improve regeneration after rodent spinal cord injury. We hypothesized that the mammalian enzyme arylsulfatase B (ARSB) would also enhance recovery after mouse spinal cord injury. Application of the mammalian enzyme would be an attractive alternative to ChaseABC because of its more robust chemical stability and reduced immunogenicity. A one-time injection of human ARSB into injured mouse spinal cord eliminated immunoreactivity for chondroitin sulfates within five days, and up to 9 weeks after injury. After a moderate spinal cord injury, we observed improvements of locomotor recovery assessed by the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) in ARSB treated mice, compared to the buffer-treated control group, at 6 weeks after injection. After a severe spinal cord injury, mice injected with equivalent units of ARSB or ChaseABC improved similarly and both groups achieved significantly more locomotor recovery than the buffer-treated control mice. Serotonin and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive axons were more extensively present in mouse spinal cords treated with ARSB and ChaseABC, and the immunoreactive axons penetrated further beyond the injury site in ARSB or ChaseABC treated mice than in control mice. These results indicate that mammalian ARSB improves functional recovery after CNS injury. The structural/molecular mechanisms underlying the observed functional improvement remain to be elucidated. © 2013 Yoo et al.

84874786646	Functional role of the interaction between polysialic acid and myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate at the plasma membrane	Polysialic acid (PSA) is a homopolymeric glycan that plays crucial roles in the developing and adult nervous system. So far only a few PSA-binding proteins have been identified. Here, we identify myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) as novel PSA binding partner. Binding assays showed a direct interaction between PSA and a peptide comprising the effector domain of MARCKS (MARCKS-ED). Coimmunoprecipitation of PSA-carrying neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) withMARCKSand co-immunostaining ofMARCKSand PSA at the cell membrane of hippocampal neurons confirm the interaction between PSA and MARCKS. Colocalization and an intimate interaction of PSA andMARCKSat the cell surface was seen by confocal microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis after the addition of fluorescently labeled PSA or PSA-NCAM to live CHO cells or hippocampal neurons expressing MARCKS as a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Cross-linking experiments showed that extracellularly applied PSA or PSANCAMand intracellularly expressedMARCKS-GFPare in close contact, suggesting that PSA and MARCKS interact with each other at the plasma membrane from opposite sides. Insertion of PSA and MARCKS-ED peptide into lipid bilayers from opposite sides alters the electric properties of the bilayer confirming the notion that PSA and the effector domain ofMARCKSinteract at and/or within the plane of the membrane. The MARCKS-ED peptide abolished PSA-induced enhancement of neurite outgrowth from cultured hippocampal neurons indicating an important functional role for the interaction between MARCKS and PSA in the developing and adult nervous system. © 2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84878156206	Adhesion molecule L1 binds to amyloid beta and reduces Alzheimer's disease pathology in mice	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of elderly dementia. In an effort to contribute to the potential of molecular approaches to reduce degenerative processes we have tested the possibility that the neural adhesion molecule L1 ameliorates some characteristic cellular and molecular parameters associated with the disease in a mouse model of AD. Three-month-old mice overexpressing mutated forms of amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 under the control of a neuron-specific promoter received an injection of adeno-associated virus encoding the neuronal isoform of full-length L1 (AAV-L1) or, as negative control, green fluorescent protein (AAV-GFP) into the hippocampus and occipital cortex. Four months after virus injection, the mice were analyzed for histological and biochemical parameters of AD. AAV-L1 injection decreased the Aβ plaque load, levels of Aβ42, Aβ42/40 ratio and astrogliosis compared with AAV-GFP controls. AAV-L1 injected mice also had increased densities of inhibitory synaptic terminals on pyramidal cells in the hippocampus when compared with AAV-GFP controls. Numbers of microglial cells/macrophages were similar in both groups, but numbers of microglial cells/macrophages per plaque were increased in AAV-L1 injected mice. To probe for a molecular mechanism that may underlie these effects, we analyzed whether L1 would directly and specifically interact with Aβ. In a label-free binding assay, concentration dependent binding of the extracellular domain of L1, but not of the close homolog of L1 to Aβ40 and Aβ42 was seen, with the fibronectin type III homologous repeats 1-3 of L1 mediating this effect. Aggregation of Aβ42 in vitro was reduced in the presence of the extracellular domain of L1. The combined observations indicate that L1, when overexpressed in neurons and glia, reduces several histopathological hallmarks of AD in mice, possibly by reduction of Aβ aggregation. L1 thus appears to be a candidate molecule to ameliorate the pathology of AD, when applied in therapeutically viable treatment schemes. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84880333544	Syntenin-a promotes spinal cord regeneration following injury in adult zebrafish	In contrast to mammals, adult zebrafish recover locomotor function after spinal cord injury, in part due to the capacity of the central nervous system to repair severed connections. To identify molecular cues that underlie regeneration, we conducted mRNA expression profiling and found that syntenin-a expression is upregulated in the adult zebrafish spinal cord caudal to the lesion site after injury. Syntenin is a scaffolding protein involved in mammalian cell adhesion and movement, axonal outgrowth, establishment of cell polarity, and protein trafficking. It could thus be expected to be involved in supporting regeneration in fish. Syntenin-a mRNA and protein are expressed in neurons, glia and newly generated neural cells, and upregulated caudal to the lesion site on days 6 and 11 following spinal cord injury. Treatment of spinal cord-injured fish with two different antisense morpholinos to knock down syntenin-a expression resulted in significant inhibition of locomotor recovery at 5 and 6 weeks after injury, when compared to control morpholino-treated fish. Knock-down of syntenin-a reduced regrowth of descending axons from brainstem neurons into the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site. These observations indicate that syntenin-a is involved in regeneration after traumatic insult to the central nervous system of adult zebrafish, potentially leading to novel insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that require activation in the regeneration-deficient mammalian central nervous system. © 2013 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

84882717737	Loss of cell adhesion molecule CHL1 improves homeostatic adaptation and survival in hypoxic stress	Close homologue of L1 (CHL1) is a transmembrane cell adhesion molecule that is critical for brain development and for the maintenance of neural circuits in adults. Recent studies revealed that CHL1 has diverse roles and is involved in the regulation of recovery after spinal cord injury. CHL1 expression was downregulated in the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, and brain stem after the induction of acute hypoxia (AH). In the current study, we sought to address the role of CHL1 in regulating homeostasis responses to hypoxia using CHL1-knockout (CHL1 -/-) mice. We found that, compared with wild-type littermates, CHL1 -/- mice showed a dramatically lower mortality rate and an augmented ventilatory response after they were subjected to AH. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that CHL1 was expressed in the carotid body (CB), the key oxygen sensor in rodents, and CHL1 expression level in the CB as assayed by western blot was decreased after hypoxic exposure. The number of glomus cells and the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (a marker for glomus cells) in the CB of CHL1 -/- mice appeared to be increased compared with CHL1 +/+ mice. In addition, in the ex vivo CB preparation, hypoxia induced a significantly greater afferent nerve discharge in CHL1 -/- mice compared with CHL1 +/+ mice. Furthermore, the arterial blood pressure and plasma catecholamine levels of CHL1 -/- mice were also significantly higher than those of CHL1 +/+ mice. Our findings first demonstrate that CHL1 is a novel intrinsic factor that is involved in CB function and in the ventilatory response to AH. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84883208475	The cell adhesion molecule L1 regulates the expression of FGF21 and enhances neurite outgrowth	L1 plays a role in neural development. However, it remains unclear how L1 plays this role. In the present study, we have shown extensive outgrowth of long neurites in cerebellar neurons after treatment with either L1 or L1 antibody. Notably, the mRNA level of FGF21 was significantly increased in both L1 and L1 antibody treated neurons compared to control group. Consistently, the neurite outgrowth promoted by L1 was strongly inhibited by siRNA against FGF21 gene or a treatment of cells with FGFR inhibitor. These results demonstrate that FGF21/FGFR signaling promotes the neurite outgrowth in a L1-dependent manner. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84883293095	Transgenic overexpression of the cell adhesion molecule L1 in neurons facilitates recovery after mouse spinal cord injury	It has been shown that the X-chromosome-linked neural cell adhesion molecule L1 plays a beneficial role in regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) in young adult rodents when applied in various molecular and cellular forms. In an attempt to further characterize the multiple functions of L1 after severe SCI we analyzed locomotor functions and measured axonal regrowth/sprouting and sparing, glial scarring, and synaptic remodeling at 6. weeks after severe spinal cord compression injury at the T7-9 levels of L1-deficient mice (L1-/y) and their wild-type (L1+/y) littermates, as well as mice that overexpress L1 under the control of the neuron-specific Thy-1 promoter (L1tg) and their wild-type littermates (L1+/+). No differences were found in the locomotor scale score and single frame motion analysis between L1-/y and L1+/y mice during 6. weeks after SCI, most likely due to the very low expression of L1 in the adult spinal cord of wild-type mice. L1tg mice, however, showed better locomotor recovery than their L1+/+ littermates, being associated with enhanced numbers of catecholaminergic axons in the lumbar spinal cord, but not of cholinergic, GABAergic or glutamatergic terminals around motoneuron cell bodies in the lumbar spinal cord. Additionally, no difference between L1tg and L1+/+ mice was detectable in dieback of corticospinal tract axons. Neuronal L1 overexpression did not influence the size of the glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive astrocytic scar 6. weeks after injury. We conclude that neuronal overexpression of L1 improves functional recovery from SCI by increasing catecholaminergic axonal regrowth/sprouting and/or sparing of severed axons without affecting the glial scar size. © 2013 IBRO.

84885440959	The neural cell adhesion molecule promotes maturation of the presynaptic endocytotic machinery by switching synaptic vesicle recycling from adaptor protein 3 (AP-3)- to AP-2-dependent mechanisms	Newly formed synapses undergo maturation during ontogenetic development via mechanisms that remain poorly understood. We show that maturation of the presynaptic endocytotic machinery in CNS neurons requires substitution of the adaptor protein 3 (AP-3) with AP-2 at the presynaptic plasma membrane. In mature synapses, AP-2 associates with the intracellular domain of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). NCAM promotes binding of AP-2 over binding of AP-3 to presynaptic membranes, thus favoring the substitution of AP-3 for AP-2 during formation of mature synapses. The presynaptic endocytotic machinery remains immature in adult NCAM-deficient (NCAM-/-) mice accumulating AP-3 instead of AP-2 and its partner protein AP180 in synaptic membranes and vesicles. NCAM deficiency or disruption of the NCAM/AP-2 complex in wild-type (NCAM+/+) neurons by overexpression of AP-2 binding-defective mutant NCAM interferes with efficient retrieval of the synaptic vesicle v-SNARE synaptobrevin 2. Abnormalities in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and recycling may thus contribute to neurological disorders associated with mutations in NCAM. © 2013 the authors.

84885576795	Gold nanoparticles functionalized with a fragment of the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 stimulate L1-mediated functions	The neural cell adhesion molecule L1 is involved in nervous system development and promotes regeneration in animal models of acute and chronic injury of the adult nervous system. To translate these conducive functions into therapeutic approaches, a 22-mer peptide that encompasses a minimal and functional L1 sequence of the third fibronectin type III domain of murine L1 was identified and conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to obtain constructs that interact homophilically with the extracellular domain of L1 and trigger the cognate beneficial L1-mediated functions. Covalent conjugation was achieved by reacting mixtures of two cysteine-terminated forms of this L1 peptide and thiolated poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) ligands (∼2.1 kDa) with citrate stabilized AuNPs of two different sizes (∼14 and 40 nm in diameter). By varying the ratio of the L1 peptide-PEG mixtures, an optimized layer composition was achieved that resulted in the expected homophilic interaction of the AuNPs. These AuNPs were stable as tested over a time period of 30 days in artificial cerebrospinal fluid and interacted with the extracellular domain of L1 on neurons and Schwann cells, as could be shown by using cells from wild-type and L1-deficient mice. In vitro, the L1-derivatized particles promoted neurite outgrowth and survival of neurons from the central and peripheral nervous system and stimulated Schwann cell process formation and proliferation. These observations raise the hope that, in combination with other therapeutic approaches, L1 peptide-functionalized AuNPs may become a useful tool to ameliorate the deficits resulting from acute and chronic injuries of the mammalian nervous system. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84885650345	Role of stress system disturbance and enhanced novelty response in spatial learning of NCAM-deficient mice	The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) plays a crucial role in stress-related brain function, emotional behavior and memory formation. In this study, we investigated the functions of the glucocorticoid and serotonergic systems in mice constitutively deficient for NCAM (NCAM-/- mice). Our data provide evidence for a hyperfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with enlarged adrenal glands and increased stress-induced corticosterone release, but reduced hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor expression in NCAM-/- mice when compared to NCAM+/+ mice. We also obtained evidence for a hypofunction of 5-HT1A autoreceptors as indicated by increased 8-0H-DPAT-induced hypothermia. These findings suggest a disturbance of both humoral and neural stress systems in NCAM-/- mice. Accordingly, we not only confirmed previously observed hyperarousal of NCAM-/- mice in various anxiety tests, but also observed an increased response to novelty exposure in these animals. Spatial learning deficits of the NCAM-/- mice in a Morris Water maze persisted, even when mice were pretrained to prevent effects of novelty or stress. We suggest that NCAM-mediated processes are involved in both novelty/stress-related emotional behavior and in cognitive function during spatial learning.© 2013 Informa UK Ltd.

84887235405	Heterozygosity for the mutated X-chromosome-linked L1 cell adhesion molecule gene leads to increased numbers of neurons and enhanced metabolism in the forebrain of female carrier mice	Mutations in the X-chromosomal L1CAM gene lead to severe neurological deficits. In this study, we analyzed brains of female mice heterozygous for L1 (L1+/-) to gain insights into the brain structure of human females carrying one mutated L1 allele. From postnatal day 7 onward into adulthood, L1+/- female mice show an increased density of neurons in the neocortex and basal ganglia in comparison to wild-type (L1+/+) mice, correlating with enhanced metabolic parameters as measured in vivo. The densities of astrocytes and parvalbumin immunoreactive interneurons were not altered. No significant differences between L1+/- and L1+/+ mice were seen for cell proliferation in the cortex during embryonic days 11.5-15.5. Neuronal differentiation as estimated by analysis of doublecortin-immunoreactive cortical cells of embryonic brains was similar in L1+/- and L1+/+ mice. Interestingly, at postnatal days 3 and 5, apoptosis was reduced in L1+/- compared to L1+/+ mice. We suggest that reduced apoptosis leads to increased neuronal density in adult L1+/- mice. In conclusion, L1+/- mice display an unexpected phenotype that is not an intermediate between L1+/+ mice and mice deficient in L1 (L1-/y), but a novel phenotype which is challenging to understand regarding its underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

0344393011	Decreased Anxiety, Altered Place Learning, and Increased CA1 Basal Excitatory Synaptic Transmission in Mice with Conditional Ablation of the Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1	L1, a neural cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is involved in neuronal migration and differentiation and axon outgrowth and guidance. Mutations in the human and mouse L1 gene result in similarly severe neurological abnormalities. To dissociate the functional roles of L1 in the adult brain from developmental abnormalities, we have generated a mutant in which the L1 gene is inactivated by cre-recombinase under the control of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II 11 promoter. This mutant (L1fy+) did not show the overt morphological and behavioral abnormalities observed previously in constitutive L1-deficient (L1-/-) mice; however, there was an increase in basal excitatory synaptic transmission that was not apparent in L1-/-mice. Similar to L1-/- mice, no defects in short- and long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus were observed. Interestingly, L1fy+ mice showed decreased anxiety in the open field and elevated plus-maze, contrary to L1-/- mice, and altered place learning in the water maze, similar to L1-/- mice. Thus, mice conditionally deficient in L1 expression in the adult brain share some abnormalities, but also display different ones, as compared with L1-/- mice, highlighting the role of L1 in the regulation of synaptic transmission and behavior in adulthood.

0242389835	Nogo-A at CNS paranodes is a ligand of Caspr: Possible regulation of K 	We report Nogo-A as an oligodendroglial component congregating and interacting with the Caspr-F3 complex at paranodes. However, its receptor Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) does not segregate to specific axonal domains. CHO cells cotransfected with Caspr and F3, but not with F3 alone, bound specifically to substrates coated with Nogo-66 peptide and GST-Nogo-66. Binding persisted even after phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) removal of GPI-linked F3 from the cell surface, suggesting a direct interaction between Nogo-66 and Caspr. Both Nogo-A and Caspr co-immunoprecipitated with Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, and the developmental expression pattern of both paralleled compared with Kv1.1, implicating a transient interaction between Nogo-A-Caspr and K

84888135477	Cell recognition molecule L1 promotes embryonic stem cell differentiation through the regulation of cell surface glycosylation	Cell recognition molecule L1 (CD171) plays an important role in neuronal survival, migration, differentiation, neurite outgrowth, myelination, synaptic plasticity and regeneration after injury. Our previous study has demonstrated that overexpressing L1 enhances cell survival and proliferation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) through promoting the expression of FUT9 and ST3Gal4, which upregulates cell surface sialylation and fucosylation. In the present study, we examined whether sialylation and fucosylation are involved in ESC differentiation through L1 signaling. RNA interference analysis showed that L1 enhanced differentiation of ESCs into neurons through the upregulation of FUT9 and ST3Gal4. Furthermore, blocking the phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) signaling pathway with either a specific PLCγ inhibitor or knockdown PLCγ reduced the expression levels of both FUT9 and ST3Gal4 mRNAs and inhibited L1-mediated neuronal differentiation. These results demonstrate that L1 promotes neuronal differentiation from ESCs through the L1-mediated enhancement of FUT9 and ST3Gal4 expression. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84894374794	HMGB1 contributes to regeneration after spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish	High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1, also called amphoterin) facilitates neurite outgrowth in early development, yet can exacerbate pathology and inhibit regeneration by inducing adverse neuroinflammation when released from dying cells, suggesting that HMGB1 plays a critical, yet undefined role in neuroregeneration. We explored whether HMGB1 contributes to recovery after complete spinal cord transection in adult zebrafish. Quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization revealed that HMGB1 mRNA levels decreased between 12 h to 11 days after spinal cord injury (SCI), then returned to basal levels by 21 days. Western blot and immunohistological analyses indicated that the time course of HMGB1 protein expression after SCI parallels that of mRNA. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that HMGB1 translocates from nuclei into the cytoplasm of spinal motoneurons at 4 and 12 h (acute stage) following SCI, then accumulates in the nuclei of motoneurons during the ensuing chronic stage (after 6 days following SCI). Immunohistology of transgenic zebrafish, expressing green fluorescent protein in blood vessels, showed enhanced HMGB1 expression in blood vessels in the vicinity of motoneurons. Application of anti-sense HMGB1 morpholinos inhibited locomotor recovery by 34 % and decreased axonal regeneration by 34 % compared to fish treated with a control morpholino. The present study shows that HMGB1 expression increases in both endothelial cells and motoneurons, suggesting that HMGB1 promotes recovery from SCI not only through enhancing neuroregeneration, but also by increasing angiogenesis. The inflammatory effects of HMGB1 are minimized through the decrease in HMGB1 expression during the acute stage. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84895818151	Overexpression of BDNF increases excitability of the lumbar spinal network and leads to robust early locomotor recovery in completely spinalized rats	Strategies to induce recovery from lesions of the spinal cord have not fully resulted in clinical applications. This is a consequence of a number of impediments that axons encounter when trying to regrow beyond the lesion site, and that intraspinal rearrangements are subjected to. In the present study we evaluated (1) the possibility to improve locomotor recovery after complete transection of the spinal cord by means of an adeno-associated (AAV) viral vector expressing the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in lumbar spinal neurons caudal to the lesion site and (2) how the spinal cord transection and BDNF treatment affected neurotransmission in the segments caudal to the lesion site. BDNF overexpression resulted in clear increases in expression levels of molecules involved in glutamatergic (VGluT2) and GABAergic (GABA, GAD65, GAD67) neurotransmission in parallel with a reduction of the potassium-chloride co-transporter (KCC2) which contributes to an inhibitory neurotransmission. BDNF treated animals showed significant improvements in assisted locomotor performance, and performed locomotor movements with body weight support and plantar foot placement on a moving treadmill. These positive effects of BDNF local overexpression were detectable as early as two weeks after spinal cord transection and viral vector application and lasted for at least 7 weeks. Gradually increasing frequencies of clonic movements at the end of the experiment attenuated the quality of treadmill walking. These data indicate that BDNF has the potential to enhance the functionality of isolated lumbar circuits, but also that BDNF levels have to be tightly controlled to prevent hyperexcitability. © 2014 Ziemlińska et al.

84896340295	Analysis of human embryonic stem cells with regulatable expression of the cell adhesion molecule l1 in regeneration after spinal cord injury	Cell replacement therapy is one potential avenue for central nervous system (CNS) repair. However, transplanted stem cells may not contribute to long-term recovery of the damaged CNS unless they are engineered for functional advantage. To fine tune regenerative capabilities, we developed a human neural cell line expressing L1, a regeneration-conducive adhesion molecule, under the control of a doxycycline regulatable Tet-off promoter. Controlled expression of L1 is desired because overexpression after regenerative events may lead to adverse consequences. The regulated system was tested in several cell lines, where doxycycline completely eliminated green fluorescent protein or L1 expression by 3-5 days in vitro. Increased colony formation as well as decreased proliferation were observed in H9NSCs without doxycycline (hL1-on). To test the role of L1 in vivo after acute compression spinal cord injury of immunosuppressed mice, quantum dot labeled hL1-on or hL1-off cells were injected at three sites: lesion; proximal; and caudal. Mice transplanted with hL1-on cells showed a better Basso Mouse Scale score, when compared to those with hL1-off cells. As compared to the hL1-off versus hL1-on cell transplanted mice 6 weeks post-transplantation, expression levels of L1, migration of transplanted cells, and immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase were higher, whereas expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans was lower. Results indicate that L1 expression is regulatable in human stem cells by doxycycline in a nonviral engineering approach. Regulatable expression in a prospective nonleaky Tet-off system could hold promise for therapy, based on the multifunctional roles of L1, including neuronal migration and survival, neuritogenesis, myelination, and synaptic plasticity. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.

84899671745	The asparaginyl endopeptidase legumain is essential for functional recovery after spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish	Unlike mammals, adult zebrafish are capable of regenerating severed axons and regaining locomotor function after spinal cord injury. A key factor for this regenerative capacity is the innate ability of neurons to re-express growth-associated genes and regrow their axons after injury in a permissive environment. By microarray analysis, we have previously shown that the expression of legumain (also known as asparaginyl endopeptidase) is upregulated after complete transection of the spinal cord. In situ hybridization showed upregulation of legumain expression in neurons of regenerative nuclei during the phase of axon regrowth/sprouting after spinal cord injury. Upregulation of Legumain protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, upregulation of legumain expression was also observed in macrophages/microglia and neurons in the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site after injury. The role of legumain in locomotor function after spinal cord injury was tested by reducing Legumain expression by application of anti-sense morpholino oligonucleotides. Using two independent anti-sense morpholinos, locomotor recovery and axonal regrowth were impaired when compared with a standard control morpholino. We conclude that upregulation of legumain expression after spinal cord injury in the adult zebrafish is an essential component of the capacity of injured neurons to regrow their axons. Another feature contributing to functional recovery implicates upregulation of legumain expression in the spinal cord caudal to the injury site. In conclusion, we established for the first time a function for an unusual protease, the asparaginyl endopeptidase, in the nervous system. This study is also the first to demonstrate the importance of legumain for repair of an injured adult central nervous system of a spontaneously regenerating vertebrate and is expected to yield insights into its potential in nervous system regeneration in mammals. © 2014 Ma et al.

84904299200	The intracellular redox protein MICAL-1 regulates the development of hippocampal mossy fibre connections	Mical is a reduction-oxidation (redox) enzyme that functions as an unusual F-actin disassembly factor during Drosophila development. Although three Molecule interacting with CasL (MICAL) proteins exist in vertebrate species, their mechanism of action remains poorly defined and their role in vivo unknown. Here, we report that vertebrate MICAL-1 regulates the targeting of secretory vesicles containing immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs) to the neuronal growth cone membrane through its ability to control the actin cytoskeleton using redox chemistry, thereby maintaining appropriate IgCAM cell surface levels. This precise regulation of IgCAMs by MICAL-1 is essential for the lamina-specific targeting of mossy fibre axons onto CA3 pyramidal neurons in the developing mouse hippocampus in vivo. These findings reveal the first in vivo role for a vertebrate MICAL protein, expand the repertoire of cellular functions controlled through MICAL-mediated effects on the cytoskeleton, and provide insights into the poorly characterized mechanisms underlying neuronal protein cell surface expression and lamina-specific axonal targeting. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84904787563	NCAM deficiency in the mouse forebrain impairs innate and learned avoidance behaviours	The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) has been implicated in the development and plasticity of neural circuits and the control of hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent learning and behaviour. Previous studies in constitutive NCAM nullmutants identified emotional behaviour deficits related to disturbances of hippocampal and amygdala functions. Here, we studied these behaviours in mice conditionally deficient in NCAM in the postmigratory forebrain neurons. We report deficits in both innate and learned avoidance behaviours, as observed in elevated plus maze and passive avoidance tasks. In contrast, general locomotor activity, trait anxiety or neophobia were unaffected by the mutation. Altered avoidance behaviour of the conditional NCAM mutantswas associated with a deficit in serotonergic signalling, as indicated by their reduced responsiveness to (±)-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)-tetralin-induced hypothermia. Another serotonin-dependent behaviour, namely intermale aggression that is massively increased in constitutively NCAM-deficient mice, was not affected in the forebrain-specific mutants. Our data suggest that genetically or environmentally induced changes of NCAM expression in the late postnatal and mature forebrain determine avoidance behaviour and serotonin (5-HT)

84904994778	Neural cell activation by phenolic compounds from the Siberian larch (Larix sibirica)	Small organic phenolic compounds from natural sources have attracted increasing attention due to their potential to ameliorate the serious consequences of acute and chronic traumata of the mammalian nervous system. In this contribution, it is reported that phenols from the knot zones of Siberian larch (Larix sibirica) wood, namely, the antioxidant flavonoid (+)-dihydroquercetin (1) and the lignans (-)-secoisolariciresinol (2) and (+)-isolariciresinol (3), affect migration and outgrowth of neurites/processes from cultured neurons and glial cells of embryonic and early postnatal mice. Compounds 1-3, which were available in preparative amounts, enhanced neurite outgrowth from cerebellar granule neurons, dorsal root ganglion neurons, and motoneurons, as well as process formation of Schwann cells in a dose-dependent manner in the low nanomolar range. Migration of cultured astrocytes was inhibited by 1-3, and migration of neurons out of cerebellar explants was enhanced by 1. These observations provide evidence for the neuroactive features of these phenolic compounds in enhancing the beneficial properties of neurons and reducing the inhibitory properties of activated astrocytes in an in vitro setting and encourage the further investigation of these effects in vivo, in animal models of acute and chronic neurological diseases. © 2014 The American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.

84905453651	Ptena, but not Ptenb, reduces regeneration after spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish	Based on the observation that the tumor suppressor gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) reduces regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) as evidenced in the PTEN knockout mouse, we have investigated the function of Ptena and Ptenb, the two zebrafish homologs of mammalian PTEN, in adult zebrafish after spinal cord injury with the aim to assess the contribution of the two zebrafish genes to functional recovery in an animal species that spontaneously recovers from central nervous system injury. The inhibition of Ptena expression by antisense morpholino (MO) application improved spinal cord regeneration through 4 to 5. weeks after injury. Retrograde tracing showed regrowth of axons from neurons of the regeneration-competent nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle in the brainstem in the Ptena MO-treated fish. Ptenb MO-treated fish recovered as well as control MO-treated fish at 4 and 5. weeks after SCI, with their locomotion being similar to that of sham-injured and non-injured fish. The mRNA levels of Ptena were upregulated after SCI at the early stage after injury (12. h and 6. days) caudal to the lesion site, compared to the non-injured control, while the levels of Ptenb were upregulated only at 12. h after injury. In situ hybridization experiments were in agreement with the qPCR measurements. At the protein level, Ptena was found to be expressed in spinal motoneurons and immature neurons. These results indicate that Ptena, but not Ptenb, inhibits regeneration in zebrafish, thus sharing this feature with PTEN in mammals. The fact that zebrafish regenerate better than mammals despite the inhibitory presence of Ptena is likely due to regeneration-conducive molecules that tip the balance from inhibition to enhancement. Interestingly, although Ptena and Ptenb have been shown to be functionally redundant in promoting the development of the fish larval central nervous system, they are not functionally redundant in the adult, suggesting that regeneration in fish is not predominantly due to the overall recapitulation of development. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84905455342	Tegaserod, a small compound mimetic of polysialic acid, promotes functional recovery after spinal cord injury in mice	In a previous study, we have shown that the small organic compound tegaserod, a drug approved for clinical application in an unrelated condition, is a mimic of the regeneration-beneficial glycan polysialic acid (PSA) in a mouse model of femoral nerve injury. Several independent observations have shown positive effects of PSA and its mimetic peptides in different paradigms of injury of the central and peripheral mammalian nervous systems. Since small organic compounds generally have advantages over metabolically rapidly degraded glycans and the proteolytically vulnerable mimetic peptides, a screen for a small PSA mimetic compound was successfully carried out, and the identified molecule proved to be beneficial in neurite outgrowth in vitro, independent of its originally described function as a 5-HT4 receptor agonist. In the present study, a mouse spinal cord compression device was used to elicit severe compression injury. We show that tegaserod promotes hindlimb motor function at 6. weeks after spinal cord injury compared to the control group receiving vehicle only. Immunohistology of the spinal cord rostral and caudal to the lesion site showed increased numbers of neurons, and a reduced area and intensity of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity. Quantification of regrowth/sprouting of axons immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase and serotonin showed increased axonal density rostral and caudal to the injury site in the ventral horns of mice treated with tegaserod. The combined observations suggest that tegaserod has the potential for treatment of spinal cord injuries in higher vertebrates. © 2014 IBRO.

84905225392	Improved regeneration after femoral nerve injury in mice lacking functional T- and B-lymphocytes	The immune system plays important functional roles in regeneration after injury to the mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems. After damage to the peripheral nerve several types of immune cells, invade the nerve within hours after the injury. To gain insights into the contribution of T- and B-lymphocytes to recovery from injury we used the mouse femoral nerve injury paradigm. RAG2-/- mice lacking mature T- and B-lymphocytes due to deletion of the recombination activating gene 2 were subjected to resection and surgical reconstruction of the femoral nerve, with the wild-type mice of the same inbred genetic background serving as controls. According to single frame motion analyses, RAG2-/- mice showed better motor recovery in comparison to control mice at four and eight weeks after injury. Retrograde tracing of regrown/sprouted axons of spinal motoneurons showed increased numbers of correctly projecting motoneurons in the lumbar spinal cord of RAG2-/- mice compared with controls. Whereas there was no difference in the motoneuron soma size between genotypes, RAG2-/- mice displayed fewer cholinergic and inhibitory synaptic terminals around somata of spinal motoneurons both prior to and after injury, compared with wild-type mice. Extent of myelination of regrown axons in the motor branch of the femoral nerve measured as g-ratio was more extensive in RAG2-/- than in control mice eight weeks after injury. We conclude that activated T- and B-lymphocytes restrict motor recovery after femoral nerve injury, associated with the increased survival of motoneurons and improved remyelination. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84907192647	Tenascin-R promotes assembly of the extracellular matrix of perineuronal nets via clustering of aggrecan	Perineuronal nets (PNs) in the brains of tenascin-R-deficient (tn-r<sup>-/-</sup>) mice develop in temporal concordance with those of wild-type (tn-r<sup>+/+</sup>) mice. However, the histological appearance of PNs is abnormal in adult tn-r<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Here, we investigated whether similar defects are also seen in dissociated and organotypic cultures from hippocampus and forebrain of tn-r<sup>-/-</sup> mice and whether the structure of PNs could be normalized. In tn-r<sup>-/-</sup> cultures, accumulations of several extracellular matrix molecules were mostly associated with somata, whereas dendrites were sparsely covered, compared with tn-r<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Experiments to normalize the structure of PNs in tn-r<sup>-/-</sup> organotypic slice cultures by depolarization of neurons, or by co-culturing tn-r<sup>+/+</sup> and tn-r<sup>-/-</sup> brain slices failed to restore a normal PN phenotype. However, formation of dendritic PNs in cultures was improved by the application of tenascin-R protein and rescued by polyclonal antibodies to aggrecan and a bivalent, but not monovalent form of the lectin Wisteria floribunda agglutinin. These results show that tenascin-R and aggrecan are decisive contributors to formation and stabilization of PNs and that tenascin-R may implement these functions by clustering of aggrecan. Proposed approaches for restoration of normal PN structure are noteworthy in the context of PN abnormalities in neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and addiction.

84908350461	Interaction of the cell adhesion molecule CHL1 with vitronectin, Integrins, And the plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 promotes CHL1-induced neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration	The cell adhesion molecule close homolog of L1 (CHL1) plays important functional roles in the developing and adult nervous system. In search of the binding partners that mediate the diverse and sometimes opposing functions of CHL1, the extracellular matrix-associated proteins vitronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) were identified as novel CHL1 interaction partners and tested for involvement in CHL1-dependent functions during mouse cerebellar development. CHL1-induced cerebellar neurite outgrowth and cell migration at postnatal days 6 - 8 were inhibited by a CHL1-derived peptide comprising the integrin binding RGD motif, and by antibodies against vitronectin or several integrins, indicating a vitronectin-dependent integrin-mediated pathway. A PAI-2-derived peptide, or antibodies against PAI-2, urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), uPA receptor, and several integrins reduced cell migration. CHL1 colocalized with vitronectin, PAI-2, and several integrins in cerebellar granule cells, suggesting an association among these proteins. Interestingly, at the slightly earlier age of 4-5 d, cerebellar neurons did not depend on CHL1 for neuritogenesis and cell migration. However, differentiation of progenitor cells into neurons at this stage was dependent on homophilic CHL1-CHL1 interactions. These observations indicate that homophilic CHL1 trans-interactions regulate differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells at early postnatal stages, while heterophilic trans-interactions of CHL1 with vitronectin, integrins, and the plasminogen activator system regulate neuritogenesis and neuronal cell migration at a later postnatal stage of cerebellar morphogenesis. Thus, within very narrow time windows in postnatal cerebellar development, distinct types of molecular interactions mediated by CHL1 underlie the diverse functions of this protein.

84911922084	Function-triggering antibodies to the adhesion molecule L1 enhance recovery after injury of the adult mouse femoral nerve	L1 is among the few adhesion molecules that favors repair after trauma in the adult central nervous system of vertebrates by promoting neuritogenesis and neuronal survival, among other beneficial features. In the peripheral nervous system, L1 is up-regulated in Schwann cells and regrowing axons after nerve damage, but the functional consequences of this expression remain unclear. Our previous study of L1-deficient mice in a femoral nerve injury model showed an unexpected improved functional recovery, attenuated motoneuronal cell death, and enhanced Schwann cell proliferation, being attributed to the persistent synthesis of neurotrophic factors. On the other hand, transgenic mice over-expressing L1 in neurons led to improved remyelination, but not improved functional recovery. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether the monoclonal L1 antibody 557 that triggers beneficial L1 functions in vitro would trigger these also in femoral nerve repair. We analyzed femoral nerve regeneration in C57BL/6J mice that received this antibody in a hydrogel filled conduit connecting the cut and sutured nerve before its bifurcation, leading to short-term release of antibody by diffusion. Videobased quantitative analysis of motor functions showed improved recovery when compared to mice treated with conduits containing PBS in the hydrogel scaffold, as a vehicle control. This improved recovery was associated with attenuated motoneuron loss, remyelination and improved precision of preferential motor reinnervation. We suggest that functiontriggering L1 antibodies applied to the lesion site at the time of injury over a limited time period will not only be beneficial in peripheral, but also central nervous system regeneration.

84920135844	Induction of clusterin Expression by Neuronal Cell Death in Zebrafish	Clusterin, a protein associated with multiple functions, is expressed in a wide variety of mammalian tissues. Although clusterin is known to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases, ageing, and tumorigenesis, a detailed analysis of the consequences of gain- or loss-of-function approaches has yet to be performed to understand the underlying mechanisms of clusterin functions. Since clusterin levels change in neurological diseases, it is likely that clusterin contributes to cell death and degeneration in general. Zebrafish was investigated as a model system to study human diseases. During development, zebrafish clusterin was expressed in the notochord and nervous system. Embryonic overexpression of clusterin by mRNA microinjection did not affect axis formation, whereas its knock-down by anti-sense morpholino treatment resulted in neuronal cell death. To analyze the function of clusterin in neurodegeneration, a transgenic zebrafish was investigated, in which nitroreductase expression is regulated under the control of a neuron-specific huC promoter which is active between the stages of early neuronal precursors and mature neurons. Nitroreductase turns metronidazole into a cytotoxic agent that induces cell death within 12h. After metronidazole treatment, transgenic zebrafish showed neuron-specific cell death. Interestingly, we also observed a dramatic induction of clusterin expression in the brain and spinal cord in these fish, suggesting a direct or indirect role of clusterin in neuronal cell death and thus, more generally, in neurodegeneration.
