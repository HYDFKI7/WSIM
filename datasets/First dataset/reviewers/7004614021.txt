14744292519	Renal involvement in patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis	Renal involvement in patients with polymyositis (PM)/dermatomyositis (DM) is previously thought to be uncommon, but two main types of renal lesion have been described. First, acute tubular necrosis with renal failure related to myoglobulinemia and myoglobulinuria is a well-recognised feature of acute rhabdomyolysis. Second, chronic glomerulonephritis has been infrequently reported in a small group of patients with PM/DM. This study aims at investigating the incidence, severity and prognosis of renal disease in PM/DM patients, admitted to a single centre in a 10-year interval. The hospital records of 65 Taiwanese patients with PM/DM, examined between 1992 and 2002, were studied retrospectively. Of the 65 patients, 14 were found to have suffered varying degree of renal involvement, and the incidence rate was 21.5%. All the 14 patients had varying degree of haematuria and proteinuria. Acute tubular necrosis with renal failure developed in four patients with PM and in five patients with DM. Renal biopsy in two DM patients with overt proteinuria revealed IgA nephropathy in one and membranous nephropathy in the other. We, therefore, concluded that renal involvement in PM/DM patients is not as uncommon as previously thought. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

1842813926	Leiomyoma of the Hand Mimicking a Pearl Ganglion	Leiomyomas rarely occur in the hand. To our knowledge, there have been no reports of a leiomyoma of the hand mimicking a pearl ganglion in the English literature. We report such a case with a leiomyoma of the right third finger in a 59-year-old woman. The tumor was excised together with the underlying sheet of tissue. The pathology revealed that the tumor was linked to the underlying structure of a vascular wall by a stalk of tumor tissue. This report serves to remind clinicians to include leiomyoma in the differential diagnosis when encountering a 'ganglion-like lesion'. Also, this report demonstrates the link between a leiomyoma and its underlying origin.

21244436949	Ovarian metastasis originating from bronchioloalveolar carcinoma: A rare presentation of lung cancer	Ovarian metastasis originating from bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) has not been reported previously. We report a 63-year-old Chinese woman who was diagnosed as BAC with pleural metastasis in 1997. Four years later, she complained of vaginal bleeding, and a pelvic mass was discovered by an abdominal computerized tomography scan. Tumor debulking and total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy were performed. Pathology disclosed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, with abundant clear cytoplasm, in the ovaries. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining revealed that the tumor cells from the ovary and pleura were reactive to thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and cytokeratin-7 (CK-7) but were negative for cytokeratin-20 (CK-20). The results of immunohistochemical staining, clinical course, and pathological features were compatible with the diagnosis of BAC with ovarian metastasis. In conclusion, to investigate the primary site of a metastatic ovarian cancer, clinicians should not forget the lungs since the incidence of lung cancer in females is increasing. Moreover, a monoclonal antibody panel for TTF-1, CK-7, and CK-20 may facilitate discrimination between primary and metastasized ovarian adenocarcinomas and/or identifying tumors of pulmonary origin. © 2003 Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research.

0030010335	Intra-abdominal desmoplastic small cell tumors: Report of two cases	Two young adults that presented with intra-abdominal desmoplastic small cell tumors (DSCT) without any evidence of a primary site are described. Both cases share the clinical characteristic features of this rare tumor which include predominant intra-abdominal location as initial presentation, nesting pattern of growth, intense desmoplastic reaction, immunohistochemical reactivity for epithelial, neural and muscle markers, and highly aggressive behavior. Aggressive chemotherapy with a cisplatin-containing regimen was the main therapy to our patients. Up to the present, both cases are alive with disease. The survival is 13 and 15 months from the initial diagnosis, respectively. Interestingly, one of the cases encountered an episode of cerebral infarction at the territory of the left middle cerebral artery 12 days after the first cycle of chemotherapy. This is a previously unrecognized manifestation for this tumor type. This causal relationship between chemotherapy and an acute vascular event is the most likely explanation for our patient's stroke.

0030046962	DNA aneuploidy in benign tumors and normal tissues of the female genital tract	Few flow cytometric DNA analyses have used sufficient normal tissues and benign tumors as controls. To establish a basis for the interpretation of DNA flow cytometric results of gynecologic neoplasms, paraffin blocks from 121 patients with a diagnosis of serous cystadenoma (n = 37), mucinous cystadenoma (n = 28), leiomyoma (n = 41), and fibrothecoma (n = 15), and normal tissue samples obtained from some of these patients, including ovary (n = 20), cervix (n = 20), and myometrium (n = 20) were analyzed for nuclear DNA content. Absence of DNA aneuploidy was confirmed in all the normal tissues analyzed. Three (7.3%) of the leiomyomas, three (10.7%) of the mucinous cystadenomas, and one (6.7%) of the fibrothecomas were DNA aneuploid, whereas no unequivocal aneuploidy was found in the serous cystadenomas. The DNA indices of the aneuploid peaks varied between 1.10 and 1.97. The frequency of aneuploidy was related to tumor size in leiomyoma (p < 0.05). Prominent myxoid degeneration was noted in two of the three aneuploid leiomyomas. One of the three aneuploid mucinous tumors had focal cellular atypia and increased mitotic activity, and another had prominent papillary infoldings, focal breakdown of cyst walls, and rupture of mucin into the ovarian stroma. There was no progression or recurrence in those patients who had histologically benign but DNA aneuploid tumors during a mean follow up of 58.1 months.

0029757630	The role of DNA flow cytometry in borderline malignant ovarian tumors	BACKGROUND. The role of flow cytometric DNA analysis is predicting prognosis of patients with borderline malignant ovarian tumors has been controversial. METHODS. Fifty cases of patients with borderline malignant ovarian tumors were analyzed by histology and by flow cytometry on paraffin embedded tissue. Multiple tissue blocks and serial sections were analyzed for each tumor. The results of DNA analysis were correlated to clinicopathologic data. RESULTS. DNA aneuploidy was demonstrable in 4 cases (8%) when the most atypical section was analyzed. The overall rate of aneuploidy was 14% if additional blocks and serial sections were studied. Two patients died from tumor. One of the two patients had an initial diagnosis of stage IIc mucinous borderline tumor with DNA indices (DI) of 1.12, 1.42, and 2.04. She had a recurrence in the contralateral ovary 1 year later (DI = 1.83), and a second frankly malignant recurrence diffusely in peritoneum (DI = 1.89). The other patient had an initial diagnosis of Stage IIIc mucinous borderline ovarian tumor with pseudomyxoma peritonei. DNA diploidy was obtained in all of the samples from the primary tumor. An aneuploid peak (DI = 1.28) was demonstrated in only one serial section of the peritoneal implants. Of the other 5 patients who had aneuploid histograms but were disease-free, the DNA indices were 1.35, 1.14/1.18, 1.15, 1.20, and 1.31 and were demonstrable only in either 1 or 2 of the blocks or unproven on serial sections. All patients with diploid-peridiploid tumors were alive and disease free. CONCLUSIONS. Reproducible DNA aneuploidy of high DI may be predicting a poor outcome, whereas the significance of inconsistently reproducible aneuploidy of low DI remains to be determined. Further studies of prospective DNA analysis with adequate sampling are necessary to define the role of flow cytometry in patients with borderline malignant ovarian tumors.

0030712957	Prognostic study of gastric cancer without serosal invasion: Reevaluation of the definition of early gastric cancer	Background: Early gastric cancer, a term defined by Japanese researchers in the 1960s, is equivalent to pT1 tumor stage regardless of nodal status. Recently, there were suggestions to exclude node-positive pT1 gastric cancer from this entity and to consider node-negative pT2 gastric cancer as early gastric cancer. Study Design: A survival analysis was conducted of 294 patients who underwent resection for gastric cancers confined within the gastric wall (pT1, n = 164; pT2, n = 130) between 1986 and 1992. Results: The cumulative 5-year survival rate was 93.5% for pT1 patients and 67.9% for pT2 patients, with an overall survival of 82.5%. There was a significant difference in the 5-year survival rate between node-positive and node- negative pT1 patients (72.8% versus 95.6%; p = 0.0095). The 5-year survival rate of node-negative pT2 patients (80.4%) was significantly worse than that of node-negative pT1 patients (p = 0.011) but was not significantly better than that of node-positive pT1 patients (p = 0.4). If excellent prognosis is a prerequisite for the definition of early gastric cancer, then node-positive pT1 cancer and node-negative pT2 cancer should not be considered early gastric cancer. Conclusions: In the 1990s, now that new imaging techniques such as endoscopic ultrasonography has been introduced, the preoperative staging of gastric cancer can be made more accurately than in the 1960s, when the term 'early gastric cancer' was defined. Because the prognosis of early gastric cancers, if subcategorized by nodal status, is not homogeneously excellent, a reevaluation of the definition of early gastric cancer may be necessary.

0030723010	Glomerular transforming growth factor-β1 mRNA as a marker of glomerulosclerosis - application in renal biopsies	As transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is implicated in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis, the aim of the study was to demonstrate if levels of glomerular TGF-β1 mRNA in renal biopsies correlated with glomerulosclerosis. Glomeruli were collected by microdissection from renal biopsies in patients with membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, diabetic nephropathy, minimal change disease and IgA nephropathy presented by proteinuria when serum creatinine was < 3 mg%. Glomerular mRNAs were reverse transcribed and TGF-β1, α2(IV) collagen, β-actin cDNA quantitated by competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR). By semiquantitative electron microscopy, a 3.5-fold increase of glomerular TGF-β1/β-actin mRNA ratio in the moderate sclerotic group (n = 23, p < 0.01) and a 1.5-fold increase in the mild sclerotic group (n = 22, p < 0.05) were observed when compared to the minimal sclerotic group (n = 12). A concordant increase of glomerular α2(IV) collagen mRNA was found with 2.2- and 1.3-fold in moderate and mild sclerotic groups, respectively. The TGF-β1/β-actin mRNA ratios were highest in membranous nephropathy (466.4 ± 133.4, n = 11), followed by lupus nephritis (394.9 ± 94.8, n = 12) and diabetic nephropathy (333.2 ± 97.6, n = 10). Patients with minimal change disease (233.1 ± 54.1, n = 15) and IgA nephropathy (185.3 ± 39.6, n = 9) had low levels. The degree of glomerulosclerosis in each group followed the TCF-β1/β-actin mRNA ratios indicating that the level is the major determinant of glomerulosclerosis but not the disease entities. Glomerular TGF-β1/β-actin mRNA ratio did not correlate with clinical parameters such as the urinary protein excretion and creatinine clearance. These results suggest that glomerular TGF-β1/β-actin mRNA ratio may be used as a marker of glomerulosclerosis in renal biopsy to reflect the local sclerotic process.

0030417329	Proximal third gastric adenocarcinoma: Results of total gastrectomy by general surgeons and analysis of prognostic factors	Surgical results and prognostic factors were studied in a total of a consecutive 121 patients following total gastrectomy, without routine thoracotomy for proximal third gastric adenocarcinoma, with surgery performed between 1986 and 1992. Laparotomy was used as the first approach in all patients. Exposure of lower mediastinum was helped by incising or resecting the diaphragm around the esophageal hiatus; therefore thoracotomy was performed in only 14 (11.6%) patients. Curative resection requiring lymph node dissection up to the second echelon (D2) and free resection margin was done for 65 (53.7%) patients. Positive esophageal margin was left in 18 (14.9%) patients who, except for two, underwent palliative resection. The postoperative complication rate was 16.5% with operative mortality in five patients (14.1%). The overall cumulative five-year survival rate was 33.5%. Multivariate analysis indicated that the most important prognostic factors were distant metastasis, esophageal invasion, serosal invasion and lymph node metastasis. Positive resection margins were not independent factors. It was concluded that earlier detection before distant metastasis and esophageal invasion is important in improving the results of total gastrectomy for proximal third gastric cancer and a comparable result can be achieved without routine thoracotomy.

0030915159	Differential expression of telomerase activity in human cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia lesions	Purpose: Telomeres are tandem arrays of repeated DNA sequences located at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, and are synthesized by the enzyme telomerase. Loss of telomeric DNA may play an important role in the development of human cancers. However, very little is known about the status of telomerase during human cervical cancer development. Patients and Methods: Telomerase activity was measured by telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay in 24 cervical cancers, one carcinoma in situ (CIS), and 20 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions. Adjacent nontumor cervical tissue from the same 24 cervical cancer patients and normal cervical tissues from 11 control individuals also were examined for the presence of telomerase activity. Results: Twenty two of the 24 (91.7%) cervical cancer specimens and the single CIS tissue were strongly positive for telomerase activity. Relatively weak but distinctive telomerase activity also was detectable in one of four CIN-I (25%), two of eight CIN-II (25%), and two of eight CIN-III (25%), respectively. However, telomerase activity was not found in the 24 corresponding nontumor cervical tissues from the came cervical cancer patients and the 11 normal cervical tissues from control individuals. Conclusion: The majority of cervical cancers contain strong telomerase activity. Significant proportions of noncancerous CIN tissues also contain telomerase activity, although weaker than that in cervical cancer. It seems that there is a progressive increase of telomerase activity in association with an increased degree of cervical malignancy. These results seem to suggest that the expression of telomerase may play a crucial role in cervical cancer carcinogenesis.

0030926496	Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the uterine cervix: Association with Epstein-Barr virus and human papillomavirus	BACKGROUND. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has not been documented in previous reports of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) of the uterine cervix by either polymerase chain reaction or in situ hybridization, and the histogenesis of the tumor remains unknown. Additionally, a relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical LELC also has not been reported. METHODS. In this article, the authors describe the clinical and histopathologic findings for 15 patients with cervical carcinoma that had a histologic pattern of LELC. The polymerase chain reaction detected the presence of EBV and HPV DNA sequences in cervical LELC. RESULTS. All 15 tumors showed a typical syncytial growth pattern of undifferentiated cells with prominent lymphocytic infiltration. The detection rate of the EBV gene sequence in tissue samples from patients with LELC was more frequent than that in control patients with squamous celt carcinoma of the cervix (11 of 15 patients, 73.3% vs. 4 of 15 patients, 26.7%; P = 0.01). However, the detection rate of HPV-16 and HPV-18 DNA was significantly lower in patients with LELC tumors than in patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (3 of 15 patients, 20.0%, vs. 12 of 15 patients, 80.0%; P = 0.001). After a median follow up of 3.9 years (range, 1.8-5.3 years), the 15 patients showed no evidence of disease or metastasis after radical hysterectomy or radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS. The finding of EBV associations in cervical LELC supports the hypothesis that EBV may be involved in the pathogenesis of tumors that arise in the cervix. It is possible that cervical LELC may follow a different pathway in the pathogenesis of LELC in Asian women as compared with the more common forms of squamous cell carcinoma.

0030561560	Squamous cell carcinoma arising in mature cystic teratoma of the ovary	Treatment results of 26 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) arising in mature cystic teratoma of the ovary were analyzed. Four nulliparous patients with stage Ia tumors underwent conservative salpingo- oophorectomy. Following surgery, 2 patients had successful pregnancies. The remaining 7 patients with stage Ia tumors were observed after hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Fifteen patients with stage Ic-IV tumors underwent cytoreductive surgery followed by cis-platinum-based chemotherapy with or without sequential radiotherapy. The mean survival was 63.9 months. The overall actuarial disease-free survival at 2 years was 69%, and by stage was as follows: stage I, 100% (13/13); stage II, 100% (2/2); stage III, 30% (3/10); and stage IV, 0% (0/1). A significant difference in disease-free survival was noted in stage (P = 0.0001). Optimal versus suboptimal operation was associated with a median Kaplan-Meier survival of 65 months versus 34.8 months, with actuarial disease-free survival at 2 years of 60 and 0%, respectively (P = 0.0210). Our study shows that 67% (16/24) of the patients had SCC antigen levels exceeding 2 ng/ml, which by stage was as follows: stage I, 5/11 (45%); stage II, 1/2 (50%); stage III, 9/10 (90%); and stage IV, 1/1 (100%). After completion of treatment, all 8 patients with recurrent lesions had reelevated SCC antigen levels in series SCC antigen monitoring. In conclusion, positive prognostic factors of disease-free survival were optimal cytoreduction and lower FIGO stage. We suggest that multimodality therapy, including aggressive cytoreduction followed by cis-platinum-based chemotherapy with or without sequential radiotherapy, is recommended. In addition, we suggest that serum SCC antigen monitoring may be helpful in early detection of cancer recurrence.

0030997469	Conservative conization for microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix	OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to examine conservative conization as treatment for microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix with depth of invasion <3 mm. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve patients with microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix underwent cervical conization under colposcopic guidance followed by careful observation. RESULTS: The 12 patients were alive without evidence of disease after a mean follow-up of 6.7 years. Four pregnancies with term deliveries were identified. CONCLUSION: Microinvasive carcinoma with a depth of invasion <3 mm without confluent invasion or lymph vascular involvement can be treated successfully with conservative conization and provided a good pregnancy outcome.

0031106296	Prognostic factors in patients with bulky stage IB or IIA cervical carcinoma undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical hysterectomy	All patients with bulky (≤4 cm) Stage Ib or IIa cervical carcinoma treated at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between August 1988 and December 1991 using a strategy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin, vincristine, and bleomycin and radical hysterectomy were reviewed. Fifty-nine evaluable patients received 1 to 3 courses of chemotherapy, and 51 underwent subsequent hysterectomy. The remaining 8 patients, not completing planned surgery, were treated with definitive radiotherapy. The overall clinical response rate was 81.4% (48/59) with 18.6% complete response. Clinical response to chemotherapy was not different by stage, histologic type, tumor size, level of squamous cell carcinoma antigen or DNA ploidy. However, tumors with DNA indices (DI) greater than 1.3 were associated with higher clinical response rates than tumors with DI ≤ 1.3 (P = 0.043). Histologically proven pelvic node metastases was noted in 18.5% (10/54) who had laparotomy. Concomitant pregnancy and more than one node metastases had significant adverse influence on recurrence and death. The 5-year survival rate of those patients who received hysterectomy was 80.3%, while only 1 of the 8 patients without hysterectomy survived. Of the 7 patients received hysterectomy despite clinical poor response, only 2 had node metastases and 3 died, whereas all the 4 patients deterred hysterectomy for poor response died. This study demonstrates the value of DNA flow cytometry in predicting chemosensitivity. However, with a DI cutoff at 1.3, only 29.2% patients could be selected. Further studies are necessary to find additional indicators that predict histological response to select better candidates for this approach and to determine optimal adjunctive treatment in case that poor prognostic features are found.

0031921331	Malignant thyroid teratoma of an adult: A long-term survival after chemotherapy	Adult primary malignant teratoma of the thyroid is a rare disease that has a poor outcome despite aggressive therapy. A 32-year-old woman underwent a simple lobectomy of the thyroid for a progressively enlarged nodule in August 1990. Pathologic assessment of the tumor revealed a malignant teratoma. The physical examinations and image studies failed to find tumor in other sites. She subsequently received 6 courses of chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. She experienced a complete response to chemotherapy and remained disease-free for 6.5 years. This tumor must be included in the differential diagnosis of a thyroid tumor and may be treated as a testicular germ-cell tumor for which chemotherapy may be recommended.

0031193576	A randomized trial of concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy in advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix	The purpose of our study was to determine whether the chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone with respect to survival and treatment toxicity in patients with advanced carcinoma of the cervix. From October 1990 to April 1995, a total of 122 patients with advanced cervical carcinoma were included in this study and randomly assigned to either radiotherapy or concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The patients in the concurrent group received cisplatin, vincristine, and bleomycin every 3 weeks for a total of four courses, in combination with radiotherapy concurrently. Sixty patients were randomized to the concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and 62 were randomized to the radiotherapy alone. A tumor response was observed in 88.3% of the patients in concurrent group and in 74.2% of the patients in radiotherapy group (P = 0.04). After a median follow-up of 46.8 months, the overall disease-free survival and actuarial survival rate at 3 years were 51.7 and 61.7% in the concurrent group, and 53.2 and 64.5% in the radiotherapy group, respectively. Treatment-related toxicity appears to be higher with the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone (36.7% versus 17.7%, P = 0.02). However, analysis by Kaplan-Meier method showed that the actuarial survival was not statistically different between the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups (mean survival time: 38.1 months versus 41.5 months, P = 0.27). In conclusion, this study showed that concurrent multiagent chemoradiotherapy did not prove to be a superior definitive therapy over radiotherapy alone for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma.

0031973877	Intraosseous tophaceous pseudotumor in the trigonal process of the talus	Primary gout with destructive tophaceous pseudotumor development rarely occurs in juvenile patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. An expansile, intraosseous tophaceous pseudotumor on the posterior process of the talus was verified in a 14-year-old boy with posterior ankle impingement and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. A review of the literature found no similar cases had been reported. The pathogenesis of this intraosseous tophaceous pseudotumor on the trigonal process probably was caused by the penetration of urate crystals from the periosteum into the posterior process of the talus. However, the time that this intraosseous tophaceous pseudotumor developed probably was close to the time that the second ossification center of the talus fused to the talus. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that the intraosseous tophaceous pseudotumor had formed during the fusion process of the second ossification center as a possible pathogenic mechanism in this unusual case.

0032486454	Distant metastasis of gastric cancer is associated with elevated expression of the antimetastatic nm23 gene	To understand the clinical significance of nm23 gene expression in gastric cancer patients, the Nm23-H1 protein level of fresh resected specimens from a total of 37 gastric cancer patients was measured by Western blot analysis. The elevated nm23 expression group (Nm23-H1 protein level in tumor tissue greater than the 75th percentile value of patients) was significantly associated with the histologically differentiated type (P = 0.036). This group had a higher incidence of distant (hematogeneous) metastasis (P = 0.0023) and a lower 2-year disease-free survival rate (P = 0.033) than the non-elevated group. The result was not consistent with the previous assumption that nm23 is an antimetastatic gene for gastric cancer.

2342436598	Usefulness of human papillomavirus testing in the follow-up of patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia after conization	Objective: We aimed to define the adjunctive role of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing in the follow-up of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) after conization. Study design: We analyzed a consecutive series of 2,154 patients who received conization. Patients who had cone diagnosis of cervical cancer or CIN 1, a hysterectomy within 12 weeks after conization, and no follow-up data were excluded. The remaining 765 patients (monitored by Pap smears, colposcopy with or without high-risk HPV DNA testing) were analyzed. Results: Of the 765 patients, 279 had CIN at cone margin or endocervix (group A) while 486 were both margin- and endocervix-free (group B). The 3-year cumulative rate of residual/recurrent high-grade CIN was 10.3% (95% CI, 6.9-13.7). HPV follow-up status (P = .015), margin status (P = .001), and follow-up cervical cytology (P < .0001) were significant predictors for residual/ recurrent high-grade CIN by multivariate analysis. Four high-grade CINs and 1 microinvasive carcinoma of group A were detected initially by HPV testing, while 48.3% (199/410) of those without recurrent/persistent high-grade CIN still had persistent HPV infection. Conclusion: HPV DNA testing is useful in the follow-up and understanding of the natural history after conization for high-grade CIN. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

24744438454	Clinical relevance of nonvisualized sentinel lymph nodes in unselected breast cancer patients during lymphoscintigraphy	Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in breast cancer is an effective technique with a high degree of accuracy and low false-negative rate to replace axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). This study analyzed the major clinicopathological factors associated with nonvisualized sentinel nodes during preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. Methods: Breast cancer patients who underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel node biopsy between 2000 and 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. Sentinel node biopsy was performed with a two-day protocol. On day one, a filtered (45 μ m Millipore) technetium-99m sulfur colloid isotope with a mean radioactive dose of 37 MBq (1 mCi) in a diluted volume of 1 ml was injected subdermally just above the primary breast tumor site. Serial dynamic images were taken with a high-resolution collimator and a static image was acquired after the SLN was identified. No hot spot identified two hours after injection was classified as nonvisualization unless lymphatic drainage channels were viewed by the lymphoscintigraphy and a prolonged two hour scan was obtained. Sentinel nodes were harvested on day two. The cases with nonvisualized sentinel nodes were analyzed according to clinical histopathologic parameters to determine the clinical significance. Results: A total of two hundred thirty-two breast cancer patients were enrolled in this study. Twenty-four of these cases presented with advanced breast cancer prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The sentinel node was nonvisualized in twenty-seven of two hundred thirty-two cases (11.6%). Tumor size (p = 0.025) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.001) were two factors associated with nonvisualized sentinel node in univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that more than three nodes (p = 0.001) and more than ten nodes (p = 0.001) metastasis were independent factors associated with nonvisualized sentinel node. Conclusions: Patients with more than three axillary nodes metastasis is an independent factor associated with nonvisualized sentinel node during lymphoscintigraphy.

24944552862	Risk stratification of patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of cervix treated by radiotherapy alone	Purpose: To identify prognostic factors for local and distant relapse and perform risk stratification for patients with advanced cervical cancer treated with radiotherapy (RT) alone. Methods and Materials: A total of 1031 patients with Stage IB-IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix treated with full-course RT but without any chemotherapy were included for analysis. Of these, 311 patients with nonbulky Stage IB-IIA disease were designated the reference group and the other 720 patients were the study group. The associations of stage, squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-ag) level, hemoglobin level, age, cell differentiation, and pelvic lymph node status with treatment failure were evaluated. The independent prognostic factors were identified by multivariate analysis. The study group was further stratified into subgroups using combinations of these risk factors. Results: In the study group, independent risk factors for local relapse were advanced stage and age <45 years. The 5-year local relapse-free survival rate was 86% for patients <45 years with bulky Stage IB-IIA or IIB disease, and was even greater, up to 90% if the SCC-ag level was <2. In contrast, it was 65% for patients with Stage IIIB who were <45 years old. The independent risk factors for distant failure were advanced stage, SCC-ag level >2, and positive pelvic lymph nodes. The 5-year distant relapse-free survival rate was 83% for patients with bulky Stage IB-IIA and IIB disease, SCC-ag level <2, and negative lymph nodes and 43% for patients with Stage III, SCC-ag level >2, and positive lymph nodes. Conclusion: The risk of treatment failure in advanced-stage cervical cancer patients treated by RT alone can be more precisely predicted by risk stratification. A certain subgroup of patients had better control than the others. The benefit of treating these relatively low-risk patients with additional treatment such as concurrent chemotherapy should be further evaluated in prospective studies or meta-analyses. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

2542466087	Diagnostic value of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial lung biopsy in peripheral lung cancers	Background and Purpose: The diagnostic yield of flexibel fiberoptic bronchoscopy for peripheral lung cancers is still limited. This study evaluated whether endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) may help localized and improve the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopic transbrochial lung biopsy in peripheral lung cancer. Methods: Between July 2001 and May 2002, 218 patient received transbrochial lung biopsy during bronchoscopic examinations with (n = 122) or without EBUS guidance (n = 96) and had the presence of peripheral lung cancers subsequently confirmed. These 218 patients were included in this retrospective analysis. Results: The diagnostic accuracy of transbrochial lung biopsy was significantly increased under EBUS guidance for small cell carcinoma (65.6%) and for non-small cell carcinoma (42.7%) [p < 0.01]. For peripheral lung cancer either smaller than 2 cm or larger than 2 cm, the diagnostic yield of transbronchial lung biopsy with EBUS guidance was significantly higher (66.0% vs 42.3%, p < 0.0002 for mass larger than 2 cm; 54.5% vs 0%, p < 0.04 for mass smaller than 2 cm). EBUS provided a better diagnostic yield (p=0.014; odds ratio, 0.219) for lesions localized at the left upper lobe, which are generally thought to be more difficult to a approach through bronchoscopy. There were no significant differences in complications between patients who underwent bronchoscopy with or without EBUS guidance. Conclusions: Under EBUS guidance, the diagnostic yield of transbrochial lung biopsy in peripheral lung cancer by bronchoscopic examination was significantly improved without difference in the complication rate.

28844454587	Diagnosis of nodal Langerhans cell histiocytosis by fine needle aspiration cytology	Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease and disease confined to the lymph nodes is even more uncommon. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of LCH of the lymph nodes has rarely been described. A case study of LCH of the lymph nodes in a 23-year-old man is presented. FNA smears showed high cellularity composed of many isolated Langerhans cells (LCs) with nuclear grooves admixed with numerous eosinophils, lymphocytes, giant cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Further immunohistochemical study of the excised lymph node sections revealed that the histiocytes were positively stained with CD1a. The presence of LCs with nuclear grooves and eosinophils suggests the possibility of LCH. FNA cytology is a valuable method for diagnosis.

27644454838	Identifying good prognosis group of breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive axillary nodes for adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy	Objective: We conducted a retrospective analysis of prognosis factors for survival in breast cancer patients with 1-3 axillary lymph node metastases and tried to identify a subset of patients with good prognosis suitable for cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: A cohort of 446 breast cancer patients received definite surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from 1990 to 1998. They were enrolled in the study. The median follow-up time was 69 months. Prognostic factors including age, tumor size, number of involved nodes, steroid receptor status, tumor ploidy, synthetic-phase fraction, histologic grade and administration of tamoxifen were analysed for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) by Cox regression model. Results: The estimated 5 year OS and DFS for all patients were 85.4 and 71.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor size, age and estrogen receptor (ER) status were independent prognostic factors for OS, and tumor size, age, ER status and number of involved nodes were independent prognostic factors for DFS. The 5 year OS rates of the low-risk group (age >40, tumor ≤3 cm and positive ER) and average-risk group (either age ≤40, tumor >3 cm or negative ER) were 98.8 and 82.4%, respectively (P = 0.0001). The 5 year DFS of the low-risk and high-risk group were 88.2 and 67.7%, respectively (P = 0.0001). Conclusion: Among breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes excellent survival rate was found in those who had favorable prognostic factors, including age >40, tumor size ≤3 cm and positive ER. Adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF regimen is optimal for these low-risk patients. © 2005 Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research.

29144433592	Prognostic factors and impact of adjuvant chemotherapy for uterine leiomyosarcoma	Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate prognostic factors and impact of adjuvant therapy for uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS). Methods. All cases with uterine LMS were retrieved from medical registry (1984 through 2003) of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. After excluding cases with initial surgery at outside the hospital, missing chart, and wrong pathologic diagnosis, 51 patients (41 for stage I, 7 for stage III, and 3 for stage IV) met the study criteria. Approximate stratified analysis and Cox proportional hazards model were used to adjust confounding factors. Results. The median follow-up for survivors was 47 months. Five-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 67.4% and 59.2% for the whole series. Multivariate Cox regression analyses selected age (>50 versus ≤50 years: relative risk [RR], 11.07 [95% CI 1.53-80.34]), tumor size (>11 versus ≤11 cm: RR, 11.63 [95% CI 2.14-63.12]), stage (III and IV versus I: RR, 21.24 [95% CI 2.20-204.98]), and adjuvant chemotherapy (yes versus no: RR, 0.08 [95% CI 0.01-0.81]) as significant predictors of death. Besides, surgical stage (P = 0.021), tumor size (P = 0.005), and adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.011) were significantly correlated with RFS. After approximate stratification, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy also significantly decreased RR of death. Conclusions. This is the first report to demonstrate benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for LMS despite the limitation of sample size and its retrospective nature. Prospective multicenter trials are necessary to clarify the role of chemotherapy, selecting criteria, and optimal chemotherapy regimen for uterine LMS. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

28344447924	Ovarian endometrioma complicated by a Salmonella abscess caused by an enteroovarian fistula: A case report	BACKGROUND: Salmonella infection occurs primarily in the gastrointestinal tract but may also be found at extraintestinal locations. An ovarian abscess caused by Salmonella is one of the rare extraintestinal infections, and hematogenous spread by bacteremia to a preexisting ovarian cyst has been suggested as the cause of such infections. CASE: A 43-year-old woman presented with diarrhea, fever and an ovarian tumor and was treated initially with antibiotics for Salmonella bacteremia, followed by an exploratory laparotomy due to persistent fever and progressive toxic signs. A pus-containing endometrioma with a thick wall densely adhering to an intestinal segment, with a fistula connecting the 2, was found during surgery. The patient underwent a salpingo-oophorectomy and resection of the intestinal segment, took antibiotics and recovered. Bacterial culture of the abscess showed salmonellosis, and pathology reported a fistula between the ovarian tumor and intestine, suggesting that direct spread through a fistula may be one of the causes of extraintestinal Salmonella infections. CONCLUSION: Salmonella infection located in the ovary is a rare condition, often caused by bacteremia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an ovarian Salmonella abscess that occurred through a fistula. © Journal of Reproductive Medicine®, Inc.

33645354555	Ovarian endometrioid carcinoma with diffuse pigmented peritoneal keratin granulomas: A case report and review of the literature	The presence of keratin granulomas in peritoneal cavity associated with ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, which might be related to leakage from the ovarian tumor, is rarely reported. Its clinical significance has not yet been well investigated. We report a case presenting with intermittent abdominal pain after an acute episode 1 month before a complex adnexal tumor was noted. Comprehensive cytoreductive surgery was performed. The ovarian tumor was an endometrioid adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation. There were diffuse brownish flecks over the omental surface and pelvic peritoneum, which contained fragments of degenerated squamous cells, keratin, and numerous foreign body giant cells. Extensive multiple sections were examined for these implants. DNA flow cytometry and various immunostaining studies (HER-2/neu, p53, CK-7, and cytokeratin [AE1/AE3]) were performed. Since viable epithelial cells in the implants could be differentially identified against mesothelial or granulomatous components by CK-7 staining and DNA aneuploidy was demonstrated on primary ovarian tumor, four courses of chemotherapy were administered. The patient has been free of disease for 18 months since diagnosis. © 2006 IGCS.

33646504879	Molecular characterization of adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix using microarray analysis of gene expression	In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms for the different clinical features between adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma (AC/ASC) and squamous carcinoma (SC) of the uterine cervix, we analyzed gene expression profiles of different histological subtypes of cervical cancer. Cancer specimens and the surrounding normal tissue counterparts were separately collected from cervical cancer patients undergoing type III radical hysterectomy. Paired total RNA (cancer and normal tissues) was isolated and analyzed with cDNA microarrays containing duplicate spots of 7 334 sequence-verified human cDNA clones. Selected differentially expressed genes specific for AC or SC were further verified using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTQ-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Genes, including CEACAM5, TACSTD1, S100P and MSLN were upregulated in AC. Contrarily, genes involved in epidermal differentiation complex such as S100A9 and ANXA8 were upregulated in SC. Cross-validation of the results using an independent but comparable group of patients with known long-term outcomes (n = 63, median follow-up 70.3 months; range, 4-208 months) showed that the correlation between the selected 6 differentially expressed genes and histology was highly significant. CEACAM5 (p < 0.0001) and TACSTD1 (p = 0.009) were significant prognostic factors by multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The combination of cDNA microarray, RTQ-PCR and immunohistochemical results of this study showed that it is possible to define different gene profiles for AC and SC. Moreover, TACSTD1 expression may be a novel poor prognostic factor. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

33646543308	Comparison between the Hybrid Capture II test and an SPF1/GP6+ PCR-based assay for detection of human papillomavirus DNA in cervical swab samples	We compared the efficacy of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection between a PCR-based genechip (Easychip HPV Blot [hereafter referred to as HPV Blot]; King Car, Taiwan) method and Hybrid Capture II (HCII; Digene, Gaithersburg, MD) in women with previous normal (n = 146) or abnormal (≥atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS] [n = 208]) cytology. A total of 354 cervical swab samples were collected for HPV DNA assay by both HCII and SPF1/GP6+ PCR followed by HPV Blot tests. Colposcopy-directed biopsy was performed if clinically indicated. Of the 354 samples, HPV-positive rates by these two methods (HCII and HPV Blot) were 12.6% and 18.2% in 143 normal samples, 36.2% and 45.7% in 105 ASCUS samples, 57.4% and 57.4% in 94 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion samples, and 83.3% and 75.0% in 12 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion samples, respectively. The concordance of HPV Blot and HCII was 80.8% (286/354), and the agreement between the methods (κ value, 0.68) was substantial. Discrepancies were further investigated by at least one of the following three methods: direct sequencing, type-specific PCR, and HPV Blot genotyping of cervical biopsy tissue. In the 15 HCII-positive samples, HPV Blot detected only non-HCII HPV genotypes; results of further verification methods were consistent with the latter test in the 15 samples. Of the 20 samples with HCII-negative and HPV Blot-positive results, 18 were found to contain the 13 HCII high-risk genotypes by verification methods. In only 16.7% (3/18) of the HCII-positive but HPV Blot-negative samples, further studies detected the 13 HCII genotypes. We conclude that HPV Blot seemed comparable to HCII for detection of HPV DNA in cervical swab samples. Copyright © 2006, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

33745450900	Treatment of patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor of small bowel: Implications of imatinib mesylate	Aim: To examine the impact of imatinib mesylate (Glivec) on patient survival and response and its safety, and the correlation of the response rate with the kit gene mutation status. Methods: Thirty-three of 74 (44.6%) small bowel gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients who developed recurrence after curative resection and not treated with Glivec were classified as group A patients. Twenty-two advanced small bowel GIST patients treated with Glivec were classified as group B patients. Clinicopathological features, post-recurrence and overall survival rates were compared. Each tumor in group B patients was investigated for mutations of kit or platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFRA). The mutation type was correlated with clinical outcomes. The anti-tumor effect and safety of Glivec in group B patients were also assessed. Results: Advanced small bowel GIST patients treated with Glivec had substatntially longer post-recurrence survival and higher overall survival rates than those not treated with Glivec. A total of 15 patients had a partial response (PR) (67.8%). Activated mutations of c-kit were found in 16 of 19 tested patients and no PDGFRA mutant was identified. In 13 patients with GISTs harboring exon 11 kit mutations, the partial response rate (PR) was 69.3%, whereas two of three patients with tumors containing an exon 9 kit mutation had an overall response rate (ORR) of 66.7% (not significant). Conclusion: Glivec significantly prolongs the post-recurrence and overall survival of Asian patients with advanced GISTs. Glivec induces a sustained objective response in more than half of Asian patients with advanced small bowel GISTs. Activated mutations of kit exon 11 are detectable in the vast majority of GISTs. There is no difference in the PR rate for patients whose GISTs have kit exon 9 and exon 11 mutations. © 2006 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

33747002234	Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha Converting Enzyme in Human Gestational Tissues from Pregnancies Complicated by Chorioamnionitis	Chorioamnionitis increases the risk of preterm labour and is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes including cerebral palsy. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) derived from the gestational tissues (placenta, fetal membranes and maternal decidua) is thought to play a pivotal role in the induction of cytokine response in chorioamnionitis. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) is essential for the release of TNF-α. Our aim was to determine whether the expression of TACE is increased in human gestational tissues from pregnancies complicated by chorioamnionitis, and whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes increased expression of TACE in the human gestational tissues in vitro. The immunostaining of TACE was generally more intense, in particular in the syncytiotrophoblast and stromal cells, in villous samples from pregnancies complicated by chorioamnionitis than those from normal pregnancies. Increased immunoreactivity of TACE was also noted in the amnion and choriodecidua. In parallel, there was an increased infiltration of monocytes/macrophages within the villous stroma and choriodecidua. As a complement to our in vivo findings, LPS significantly increased the levels of mRNA and protein of TACE in a dose-dependent response in villous and fetal membrane explant cultures. Together, our results imply a potential role of TACE in the pathogenesis of chorioamnionitis. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33751237679	Multidetector computed tomography assessment on tumor size and nodal status in patients with locally advanced breast cancer before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy	Aims: To evaluate the utility of multidetector computed tomography (MCT) in assessing tumor size and nodal status in patients with advanced breast cancers before and after the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: Twenty-eight proven locally advanced breast cancer patients with 30 tumors were enrolled in this study. MCT was used to assess tumor size and axillary lymph nodes before and after the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The correlation between tumor size on MCT and gross tumor size was tested. Results: The MCT measurements documented complete response in 3, partial response in 18, non-response in 8 and progressed in 1. The mean tumor diameters on pathology and post-chemotherapy MCT were 3.6 cm (S.D. = ±2.9 cm) and 3.1 cm (S.D. = ±2.6 cm), respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.76 (p < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive valve, negative predictive valve and accuracy of MCT in diagnosing the axillary lymph node metastases after pre-operative neoadjuvant chemotherapy were counted, respectively, to 72%, 40%, 85.7%, 22.2% and 66.7%. All the 5 downstaged axillary nodal statuses from node-positive to node-negative on MCT had micrometastases. Conclusion: MCT can be used to evaluate tumor size and nodal status in patients with advanced breast cancer. As there is a baseline MCT before chemotherapy for comparison, we are potentially aware of the possibility of false negative nodal micrometastases on the post-chemotherapy MCT. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33845604577	Radioguided sentinel lymph node biopsy in early breast cancer: Experience at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital	Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy can identify regional metastases and provides an alternative to axillary dissection that avoids arm morbidity. This investigation assessed the accuracy of SLN biopsy for predicting axillary node status. Methods: A total of 174 clinical node-negative breast cancer patients and 165 SLN biopsies were enrolled. SLN biopsy was performed in a two-day protocol with backup axillary dissection: subdermally injected technetium-99 sulfur colloid to detect and localize SLN on day one; sentinel node harvesting under gamma-counter guidance on day two. Clinicopathological factors were statistically analyzed to assess the accuracy of the SLN biopsy. Results: The SLN was identified in 94.3% (165 of 175) of cases. SLN biopsy had an accuracy of 98.2%, with sensitivity of 93.7%, specificity of 100%, negative predictive value of 97.5% and positive predictive value of 100%. Three SLN negative cases had non-SLN metastasis representing a false-negative rate of 6.3% (3 of 48). Tumor size was the only factor statistically correlated with the accuracy of the SLN biopsy. The diagnostic accuracy for tumors sized 2 cm or below was 100%. Hematoxylin-eosin stain followed by immunohistochemical stain increased the diagnosis of axillary metastasis from 25.5% to 29.1%. Conclusion: SLN biopsy can accurately forecast axillary node status in early breast cancer, particularly in patients with tumor sizes of no more than 2 cm.

33751002071	Prognosis of breast cancer after supraclavicular lymph node metastasis: Not a distant metastasis	Background: We performed this study to analyze the survival of breast cancer patients with isolated supraclavicular lymph node metastasis (SLNM) and assess whether SLNM is distant metastasis or not. Methods: Sixty-three patients who developed an isolated SLNM among 3170 primary breast cancer patients between 1990 and 1999 were enrolled. The survival after SLNM was compared with that of 151 patients who developed local recurrences and 599 who had distant metastasis and was analyzed according to different levels and numbers of positive axillary nodes. Results: Thirty-five of the 63 patients died during a median follow-up of 58.3 months. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates after SLNM, local relapse, and distant metastasis were 33.6%, 34.9%, and 9.1%, respectively. The 5-year OS for patients with involved nodes confined to axillary level I was 74.4%, which was significantly better than that for involved nodes in level II or III or SLNM (49.2%, 52.8%, and 33.6%, respectively; P < .0001). For one to three positive axillary nodes, the 5-year OS was 83.2%, which was significantly better than that for four to nine positive nodes, more than nine positive nodes, and SLNM (62.6%, 42.3%, and 33.6%, respectively). There was no significant difference between SLNM and more than nine positive nodes. Surgical removal of the supraclavicular nodes was a significantly better prognostic factor for OS after SLNM (P = .0327). Conclusions: The 5-year OS after supraclavicular nodal metastosis, local relapse, and distant metastasis were 33.6%, 34.9%, and 9.1%, respectively. Good neck control either by surgery or chemotherapy achieved better survival. © 2006 Society of Surgical Oncology.

33947197371	Human papillomavirus genotype in cervical cancer: A population-based study	Our aim was to investigate the human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype distribution and correlation between HPV parameters and clinicopathological variables in cervical carcinoma treated in a large tertiary referral medical center in Taiwan. Consecutive patients treated for cervical carcinoma (Stages I-IV according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) between 1993 and 2000 were included. HPV genotyping using SPF1/GP6+ PCR was performed, followed by hybridization with a genechip (Easychip® HPV Blot, King Car, Taiwan). E6 type-specific PCR was performed to validate multiple-type. HPV-negative samples were further verified by type-specific PCR and a repeat HPV Blot. A total of 2,118 patients were eligible for analysis. HPV DNA sequences were detected in 96.6% (95% CI, 95.8-97.4%) of the specimens, among which 82% harbored single-type and 18% contained multiple-type HPV sequences. Thirty-five types of HPV were identified and the leading 8 were HPV16 (50.0%), HPV18 (17.8%), HPV58 (16.3%), HPV33 (8.7%), HPV52 (6.8%), HPV39 (3.0%), HPV45 (2.5%) and HPV31 (2.3%). HPV58 or 33 or 52 was detected in 30.3% (641/2,118). By multivariate analysis, HPV58- or 33- or 52-infection was significantly associated with older age (p < 0.001) and primary radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation (RT/CCRT) (p < 0.001). Among HPV-positive cases, multiple-type was more frequently seen in those receiving primary RT/CCRT (p < 0.001). The knowledge of HPV genotype distribution will form a basis for guidelines in HPV-based cervical cancer screening and cost-effective multivalent HPV vaccine policy in Taiwan and in the world. The association between HPV parameters and clinicopathological variables warrants further investigations. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

34447098920	Plexiform schwannoma of the clitoris: Case report	Only three cases of clitoral schwannoma have been reported in the English language literature, with none of them being a plexiform schwannoma. Here we report the first plexiform schwannoma of the clitoris. A 41-year-old woman without neurofibromatosis presented with a 2×2 cm, slowly growing, painless tumor of the clitoris. Simple excision of the tumor was performed, and pathological examination revealed a plexiform schwannoma. No evidence of recurrence was noted after 2 years of follow-up. Despite its rarity, a schwannoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of a clitoral enlargement or mass. Our case, despite its unique plexiform growth pattern, has clinical features similar to those of other reported cases of clitoral schwannoma. © Apmis 2007.

34548502976	Role of human papillomavirus genotype in prognosis of early-stage cervical cancer undergoing primary surgery	Purpose: Our aim was to evaluate the prognostic significance of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype in early-stage cervical carcinoma primarily treated with surgery in a large tertiary referral medical center. Patients and Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent primary surgery for invasive cervical carcinoma of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I to IIA between 1993 and 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a general primer set followed by reverse-blot detection of 38 types of HPV DNA in a single reaction was performed for genotyping. E6 type-specific PCR was performed to validate multiple types. Results: A total of 1,067 eligible patients were analyzed. HPV DNA sequences were detected in 95.1% of the specimens, among which 9.6% contained multiple types. HPV 16 was detected in 63.8% of the samples, and HPV 18 was detected in 16.5% of the samples. The median follow-up time of surviving patients was 77 months. By multivariate analysis, FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis, depth of cervical stromal invasion, grade of differentiation, and HPV 18 positivity were significantly related to cancer relapse. FIGO stage II, deep stromal invasion, parametrial extension, HPV 18 positivity, and age older than 45 years were significant predictors for death. Using the seven selected variables from either recurrence-free or overall survival analysis, death-predicting (P < .0001) and relapse-predicting (P < .0001) models classifying three risk groups (low, intermediate, and high risk) were constructed and endorsed by internal validation. Conclusion: The independent prognostic value of HPV genotype is confirmed in this study. The prognostic models could be useful in counseling patients and stratifying patients in future clinical trials. © 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

0033120677	Preoperative prognostic variables and the impact of postoperative adjuvant therapy on the outcomes of Stage IB or II cervical carcinoma patients with or without pelvic lymph node metastases: An analysis of 891 cases	BACKGROUND. The purpose of this study was to investigate pretreatment variables that could predict prognosis and to evaluate the impact of postoperative adjuvant therapy on the outcomes of patients with Stage IB or II cervical carcinoma with or without pelvic lymph node metastases. METHODS. Eight hundred ninety-one patients with Stage IB or II cervical carcinoma who underwent radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy as primary treatment at a single institution were analyzed. Potential prognostic variables were studied. RESULTS. Among the variables that could be assessed before treatment, depth of cervical stromal invasion (determined by magnetic resonance imaging), clinical stage, tumor size, grade of differentiation, and DNA index (determined by flow cytometry) were independent predictors of outcome in multivariate analysis using a Cox regression model. Three distinct prognostic groups (low, intermediate, and high risk) were defined using these variables. Five-year recurrence free survival (RFS) rates for the low, intermediate, and high risk groups were 94.6%; 82.7%, and 62.3%, respectively (P = 0.0001), and overall survival (OS) rates were 98.4%, 84.5%, and 68.7%, respectively (P = 0.0001). Among patients with pelvic lymph node metastases who were free of parametrial extension, those who received postoperative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy had significantly better RFS (P = 0.017) and OS (P = 0.043) than those who received no adjuvant therapy. Among patients without pelvic lymph node metastases but at high risk of recurrence, those who received adjuvant radiotherapy had significantly better RFS (P = 0.015) and marginally improved OS (P = 0.087) compared with those who received no adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS. A model containing assessable pretreatment variables for predicting the prognoses of patients with early stage cervical carcinoma was formulated. Subsets of patients for whom postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy might be beneficial were identified. The data from this retrospective review maybe useful when future prospective trials of the treatment of early stage cervical carcinoma are designed.

0032766228	Automated stereotaxic core needle biopsy of breast lesions	To assess the feasibility of automated stereotaxic core needle biopsy (SCNB) on breast lesions, 26 cases of mammographically suspected breast lesions that underwent SCNB were retrospectively studied. SCNB was restricted to patients with suspect breast lesions presented as microcalcification (15 cases), nodular density with calcification (7 cases), spiculated mass with microcalcification (2 cases), nodule (1 case) or architectural distortion (1 case) on mammograms. None of the suspected lesions were cystic on sonograms. According to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) developed by American College of Radiology, the lesions on mammograms were classified as probably benign lesions (BI-RADS category 3) in 2 cases, low-to- intermediate lesions (BI-RADS category 4) in 15, and highly suspect for malignancy (BI-RADS category 5) in 9. SCNB was performed on all patients. The number of specimens obtained from each lesion ranged from 4 to 10 (mean 5). Magnification radiography was used to evaluate calcification in specimen. The pathological examination of specimens from SCNB revealed benign lesions in 12 patients (fibroadenoma in 5, fibrocystic change 4, fibrosis with calcification 2, and adenosis in one), normal breast tissue in 7, and breast carcinoma in 7. All the lesions classified as BI-RADS category 3 or 4 were proved to be benign by SCNB, while 78% (7 of 9) of lesions shown as BI-RADS category 5 on mammograms were proved to be malignant by SCNB. Of 24 cases with calcification on mammograms, 14 (58%) revealed calcification on specimen radiographs. One patient with calcified fibroadenoma had a complication of bending of biopsy needle during the SCNB procedure causing failure of needle withdrawal. In conclusion, SCNB is an efficient and safe alternative in obtaining sufficient tissues for diagnosing breast lesions. It may spare some selected patients a surgical biopsy procedure. One should avoid directly targeting a densely calcified nodule.

0032896696	Detection of human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 mRNA in peripheral blood of advanced cervical cancer patients and its association with prognosis	Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of detecting human papillomavirus E6 (HPVE6) gene mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer, and the relationship of the circulating HPV viral- specific mRNA with clinicopathologic factors and prognosis of locally advanced cervical cancer. Patients and Methods: The presence of types 16 and 18 HPVE6 gene mRNA was determined by reverse transcription followed by nested polymerase chain reaction. Thirty-five patients with locally advanced cervical cancer who were positive far HPV type 16 or 18 DNA were included in the study. All patients received external-beam radiation therapy followed by intracavitary brachytherapy. Results: Eighteen (51.4%) of 35 HPV DNA-positive cervical cancer patients had HPV-specific mRNA in their peripheral blood cells, compared with none of 17 HPV DNA-negative cervical cancer patients and none of 12 control volunteers. The presence of HPVE6 gene mRNA in peripheral blood was associated with bulky tumor volume (> 4 cm) and pelvic lymph node metastasis (tumor volume, P = .03; lymph node status, P = .03). After a median follow-up of 22 months, patients who were positive for peripheral- blood HPVE6 gene mRNA had a significantly higher risk of recurrence than those who were negative (10 of 18 v three of 17, P = .02; mean recurrent time, 20.7 months v 12.6 months, P = .02). There was also a statistically significant association of peripheral-blood HPVE6 gene mRNA positivity with distant metastasis (eight of 18 vane of 17; P = .01). Conclusion: Results of this study seem to suggest that the presence of HPVE6 gene mRNA in peripheral blood may provide an early marker that identifies patients who are at risk for metastasis.

The aim of this study was to define clinicopathologic features and to investigate prognostic factors in early-stage cervical adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas in patients undergoing primary radical surgery. One hundred thirty-four patients with stage IB or II cervical adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinomas treated at a single institution were reviewed and compared to squamous carcinomas (N = 757) treated in the same period. Among adeno-adenosquamous carcinomas, stage II disease, parametrial extension, and deep cervical stromal invasion (>2/3) were associated with increased risk of pelvic lymph node metastases, while only clinical stage II, DNA index >1.3 (by flow cytometry), and pelvic node metastases were significantly associated with decreased survival by multivariate analyses. The five-year recurrence- free and overall survival rates of patients with adeno-adenosquamous vs squamous carcinoma were 72.2% vs 81.2% (P = 0.0109), and 74.1% vs 82.8% (P = 0.0136), respectively by Mantel-Cox test. After controlling confounding factors, histologic type (adeno-adenosquamous vs squamous) was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival [relative risk (RR): 1.2792; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0628-1.5399, P = 0.0092) and overall survival (RR: 1.2594, 95% CI: 1.0467-1.5155, P = 0.0146) in the whole series (N = 891). Although pattern of relapse by histologic type was not significantly different, patients with recurrent adeno-adenosquamous carcinoma did significantly worse than those with recurrent squamous carcinoma. In conclusion, the prognosis of adeno-adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix is slightly worse than squamous tumors. Since salvage of recurrent adeno-adenosquamous carcinoma after primary radical surgery is generally ineffective using conventional treatment, innovative strategies are necessary for the high-risk group after primary surgery and all recurrent adeno- adenosquamous carcinomas regardless of size or site.

0034049088	High-risk HPV DNA detection by hybrid capture II: An adjunctive test for mildly abnormal cytologic smears in women ≥ 50 years of age	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing could improve the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cancer in older women (≥ 50 years old) with mildly abnormal results on conventional cytology. STUDY DESIGN: The study was based on 119 patients aged over 50 (median, 62; range, 50-78) referred for colposcopy with Pap smears reported as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) from February 1997 to September 1998. The presence of high-risk HPV DNA (including HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 68) was determined with the Hybrid Capture II (Digene, Inc., Silver Spring, Maryland) microplate method. Cytologic examination by Pap smear was based on the Bethesda System and, cervical biopsy was done via colposcopy. RESULTS: High-risk HPV DNA was demonstrated in 75.6% (34/45) of patients with LSIL and 52.7% (39/74) with ASCUS. Those who were HPV positive were significantly more likely to have CIN or cancer (odds ratio, 33.40; 95% confidence interval, 11.89-93.97; P < .0001). The sensitivity of HPV assay for detection of lesions more severe than CIN 2 was 100%, specificity 64.8%, positive predictive value 66.7% and negative predictive value 100%. CONCLUSION: The addition of a high-risk HPV DNA assay to cytologic examination appears to provide excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value for early detection of high grade CIN or cancer in older women with minimally abnormal Pap smears.

4043164911	Human papillomavirus genotyping by a polymerase chain reaction-based genechip method in cervical carcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radical surgery	The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genechip method and to determine the prognostic value of HPV genotype in bulky stage IB or IIA cervical carcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and radical surgery. A total of 149 patients had adequate tissue for the study. The SPF1/GP6+ primers were used to amplify a 184 bp fragment. The amplimers were submitted for direct sequencing and hybridization with a genechip using revert-blot detection of 39 types of HPV DNA in a single reaction. Two runs of PCR with respective hybridization were performed for each tumor. The complete concordance of HPV genotyping was 80.5% (120/149) of the paired genechip results. The kappa coefficient was 0.634 (P < 0.0001). HPV DNA sequences were detected in 100% of the specimens, among which 67.8% harbored single type and 32.2% contained multiple types. HPV-16 was detected in 98.7%, HPV-18 in 22.8%, HPV-31 in 0.7%, HPV-45 in 1.3%, HPV-52 in 2.0%, HPV-58 in 6.7%, HPV-59 in 4.7%, and HPV-67 in 0.7%. In multivariate analyses, the HPV genotype [HPV-18 or HPV-16 and HPV-18 only versus all others: relative risk (RR), 2.33; 95% CI, 1.17-1.64; P = 0.016] and pre-NAC tumor size (>5 versus ≤5 cm: RR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.48; P = 0.021) were significantly related to overall survival. This PCR-based genechip method is sensitive and reproducible for HPV genotyping. The association of HPV-18 or HPV-16 and HPV-18 with poor outcome in cervical carcinoma treated with NAC plus radical surgery is confirmed.

34249037023	Combined ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging findings on cervical verrucous carcinoma with endometrial invasion: A case report	BACKGROUND: Cervical verrucous carcinoma is a rare form of cervical cancer. Very few reports present the correlation between diagnostic images and clinicopathologic findings. CASE: A 50-year-old woman was treated with laser ablation for cervical condyloma 6 years prior to her presentation with progressive vaginal bleeding and a foul-smelling discharge at our clinics in August 2004. Biopsy of the cervical mass was compatible with pathologic features of condyloma acuminata. Ultrasonography with color Doppler revealed a 5.9 x 4.1-cm, hyperechogenic mass with a honeycomb appearance in the lower uterine corpus and hypervascularization of the tumor with resistance indexes ranging from 0.41 to 0.47. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the tumor had a homogeneous intensity on T1-weighted images and heterogeneous intensity on T2-weighted images. After administration of contrast medium, the tumor exhibited a lower signal intensity than did the surrounding cervical stroma. A human papillomavirus test was positive for types 11 and 53. Combined with the clinicopathologic findings, verrucous carcinoma of the cervix, stage Ib2, was suspected and the patient underwent radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. The final pathology report proved the impression of malignancy. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and no disease recurred during 1 year of follow-up. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of cervical verrucous carcinoma requires a good clinical and pathologic correlation. Nevertheless, detailed imaging studies, such as ultrasound and MRI, as in our case, may provide valuable presurgical information for treatment. © Journal of Reproductive Medicine®, Inc.

59149095477	Diagnosis of human papillomavirus infection by abnormal cervical cytology is highly reproducible after vaginal douching	Objective: To evaluate whether human papillomavirus (HPV) activity in symptomatic patients with abnormal Papanicolaou smears (minimal abnormal cytology) was affected by a complete vaginal douche, applied to the cervix prior to colposcopic examination. Materials and Methods: A total of 132 women with abnormal Papanicolaou smears were prospectively registered in this study from 1999 to 2004. Two specimens were collected from each patient; one before and one after the cervix was swabbed with a complete vaginal douche during a colposcopic examination. We compared the HPV detection results before and after douching in the same patients. The samples were analyzed using the Hybrid Capture II assay. Results: Before douching, 57.6% (76/132) of the samples were HPV-positive, compared with 58.3% (77/132) of the samples after douching. There was a strong correlation between the cervical HPV detection rates between the before and after douche samples (p<0.001). The kappa statistic was 0.891 for the correlation (positive-positive, negative-negative) and the discrepancy (positive-negative) between the inter-douche rates of HPV activity. A comparison of the HPV assay before and after vaginal douching demonstrated a statistically significant relationship (p<0.001). The sensitivity of the HPV test after douching was higher (97.8%) than that before douching (95.6%). The false-negative rate before douching in women with inflammatory smears was 3% (4/132) and the false-positive rate before douching in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance was 2.1% (3/132). Conclusion: Our results indicate that self-administration of a vaginal douche is not a reliable method of eradicating HPV infection.

60549098637	Feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy in multifocal/multicentric breast cancer	Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy can replace axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in prediction of nodal status in node-negative breast cancer. However, patients presenting with multifocal/multicentric (MF/MC) breast cancer are usually excluded from studies of SLN biopsy. This study evaluated the efficacy of SLN biopsy in patients with MF/MC breast cancer. Methods: Breast cancer patients who underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and SLN biopsy with backup ALND from 2004 to 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients enrolled in this study had clinically node-negative unifocal or MF/MC breast cancer based on final histology. Sentinel node biopsy was performed with a 2-day protocol with intradermal radiocolloid injection on day one and SLN biopsy on day two. Histopathologic parameters and the efficacy of the SLN biopsy were compared between unifocal and MF/MC breast cancers. Results: This study enrolled 158 breast cancer patients; one hundred and thirty-five patients were diagnosed with unifocal and 23 with MF/MC breast cancer. The mean numbers of SLNs retrieved were 1.3 for the unifocal and 1.1 for the MF/MC groups. The identification rate, sensitivity, accuracy, and false-negative rate for unifocal and MF/MC breast cancers were 94.8%, 92.6%, 98.4%, and 7.4%; and 100%, 100%, 100%, and 0%, respectively. No significant differences were observed between the two groups for SLN identification, sensitivity, accuracy, and false-negative rate. Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node biopsy using intradermal radiocolloid injection method is feasible for MF/MC breast cancer.

0034991092	Applications of the telomerase assay in peritoneal washing fluids	Objective. The aim of this study was to detect telomerase activity in peritoneal ascites and to assess whether it can be used as an assistant tool for the early detection of ovarian cancer. Methods. Telomerase activity was measured by TRAP assay in 47 patients with ovarian malignancies and 50 patients with benign uterine leiomyomas (control group). Results. All 26 peritoneal washing cytology positive cases were telomerase positive. Of the 21 peritoneal washing cytology negative cases, 3 were telomerase positive. When these 3 were reevaluated for peritoneal cytology, malignant ascitis was identified in 1. All telomerase negative cases were negative for peritoneal washing cytology. The sensitivity and specificity of peritoneal cytology and telomerase testing in correlation with true malignant cells were 96 (26/27) and 100% (20/20) versus 100 (27/27) and 90% (18/20), respectively. The false negative rate of peritoneal cytology was 4.7% (1/21). The false positive rate of the telomerase test in relation to malignant ascites was 6.9% (2/29). Conclusion. Our preliminary results reveal a high sensitivity and specificity of both telomerase testing and conventional cytology in peritoneal fluids. Our data suggest that the telomerase test in peritoneal fluids can be used as an adjuvant to cytopathological methods in the diagnosis of malignant peritoneal ascites, particularly in cases of negative cytology. In these cases, a review of peritoneal histocytology is advised. © 2001 Academic Press.

84861576471	Human papillomavirus in vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia	There are limited data on the prevalence and distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN). We sought to clarify this issue in a series of 450 VAIN cases with a confirmed diagnosis between 1990 and 2006. HPV genotyping was performed using paraffin-embedded specimens and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. Multiple HPV types were validated by E6 type-specific PCR and direct sequencing. The HPV genotypes of the vaginal and cervical neoplasms were compared for those with incident VAIN and a history of previous/concomitant cervical neoplasms. Ki-67 was performed for supporting diagnosis of VAIN. Of these 450 VAIN cases (median age, 59 years; range, 19-93), two with missing paraffin blocks and 54 with poor DNA quality were excluded. HPV was detected in 273/394 (69.3%) VAIN, and multiple infections were found in 17.9% of HPV-positive samples. The leading types were HPV16 (35.5%), HPV58 (9.9%), HPV52 (9.9%), HPV39 (8.4%), HPV33 (7.3%) and HPV53 (7.0%). Among the 156 cases with a history of previous cervical neoplasia, 29.0% had concordant HPV genotypes, while synchronous VAIN samples (n = 49) were more likely to harbor concordant genotypes (58.7%) with the concomitant cervical neoplasm (p = 0.0003). Whether those HPV types in the incident VAIN lesions had existed in the vaginal epithelium at the time of the previous cervical neoplasia or a new acquisition needs to be clarified in prospective follow-up studies.

43049092273	Cervical cancer screening program integrating Pap smear and HPV DNA testing: A population-based study	We conducted a population-based cohort study to evaluate the complementary value of HPV testing to Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and the prevalence and genotype distribution of HPV in Taiwan. In this report, we described the design of the whole study and analyzed the cross-sectional results. Female residents (age ≥ 30 years) of Taoyuan, Taiwan were invited. After signing informed consent, every participant had a Pap smear and a HPV testing. Patients with Pap ≥ atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance (Group I) or those with HPV-positive but normal cytology (Group II) were referred for a colposcopic examination. A total of 10,014 women were eligible. The overall HPV prevalence was 10.8% (95% confidence interval 10.5%-11.4%) in the study population. A total of 37 types of HPV were identified and the leading three were HPV-52, -18 and -58. There was a significant positive correlation of HPV prevalence with older age, postmenopausal status, current-user of oral contraceptives and never-user of hormone replacement therapy. Past users of oral contraceptives and never users of Pap were associated with higher risk of abnormal Pap, while age 40-49 strata had lower risk. Fifty-nine cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 from Group I and additional 11 from Group II were identified. The improvement of sensitivity with additional HPV testing was 15.3%. Besides, no specific subgroup was found to most benefit from the combined strategy. The value of adding HPV test to conventional Pap smear has to be evaluated after longer-term follow-up of this population-based cohort. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

43349104589	Standardized uptake value in para-aortic lymph nodes is a significant prognostic factor in patients with primary advanced squamous cervical cancer	Purpose: We sought to identify prognostic factors-including positron emission tomography (PET) parameters-in patients with previously untreated squamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix and MRI- or CT-defined pelvic or para-aortic lymph node (PLN or PALN) metastasis. Materials and methods: Patients with untreated squamous cell cervical cancer and PLN or PALN metastasis detected by CT/MRI were enrolled. FDG-PET scans were performed for primary staging. Prognostic variables were investigated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Five-year recurrence-free and 5-year overall survivals (RFS and OS) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: A total of 70 patients [54 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I or II, and 16 patients with stage III or IV] were eligible. Follow-up ranged from 26.1 to 71.6 months. In multivariate analysis, FIGO stage ≥III (5-year RFS, p = 0.008; 5-year OS, p = 0.008) was a significant prognostic factor for both RFS and OS.

4444333434	Recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of cervix after definitive radiotherapy	Purpose To study retrospectively the characteristics and survival of patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix after definitive radiotherapy (RT) and to identify subsets of patients who might benefit from aggressive salvage treatment. Methods and materials Between 1990 and 1999, 1292 patients with Stage I-IVA SCC of the cervix underwent full-course RT. Of the 1292 patients, 375 (29%) had either local or distant failure and were included in this analysis. The 35 patients (2.7%) with both pelvic and distant relapse were excluded. In the 162 patients with local failure, 71 (44%) had persistent disease and 91 (56%) had a relapse after complete tumor regression. Of these 162 patients, 47 (29%) received salvage surgery. In the 213 patients with distant failure, 46 (22%) had isolated para-aortic lymph node (PALN) metastasis, and 35 (76%) of them were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy/RT. Patients with supraclavicular lymph node (SCLN) relapse usually underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Palliative chemotherapy and/or RT were given by decision of the responsible attending physician. Results The independent prognostic factors for local failure were advanced stage and young age (<45 years) and, for distant failure, were advanced stage, positive pelvic lymph nodes, and high serum SCC-antigen levels. The 5-year overall survival rate was 10% and 11%, respectively, for patients with local or distant failure. For local relapse, the 5-year overall survival rate was 29% vs. 3% (p = 0.0001) for patients with vs. without salvage surgery and 22% vs. 9% vs. 4% for patients with tumors confined to the cervix, tumors extending but not beyond the cervix and adjacent tissues, and tumor extending beyond adjacent tissues but contained within the pelvis (p = 0.005). The survival rates, either with or without salvage surgery, were nearly identical between patients with persistent disease and those with relapse after complete regression. The 3-year overall survival rate was 34%, 28%, and 5% (p = 0.001), respectively, for patients with PALN relapse alone, SCLN relapse with or without PALN relapse, and relapse other than PALN and SCLN. Of the patients with PALN relapse alone, 27% survived >5 years. Conclusion For recurrent SCC of the cervix after RT, patients with isolated PALN relapse salvaged by RT or combined chemoradiotherapy or those with cervical relapse salvaged by surgery can achieve long-term survival. Early detection of relapse with aggressive salvage treatment is important for achieving better outcome. Patients with persistent disease or relapse after complete remission had similar outcomes. Patients with SCLN relapse had a longer survival time than those with other metastases (except PALN), and palliative RT might be beneficial. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

4544294791	Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia in an ovarian steroid cell tumor with virilization: A case report	BACKGROUND: Extramedullary hematopoiesis in patients without hematologic disorders is very rare and has apparently never been described previously in association with an ovarian steroid cell tumor. CASE: An 18-year-old woman was admitted to our clinic due to primary amenorrhea. On examination she had significant facial hirsutism, clitoromegaly and Adam's apple. The serum level of testosterone was elevated. A 7-cm, right ovarian mass was enucleated during laparotomy. Histology revealed a steroid cell tumor with foci of myeloid metaplasia; bony trabecula formation was present. There was no evidence of hematologic or systemic disease. The hormone values became normal 1 month postoperatively. CONCLUSION: This report describes a patient with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia in an ovarian steroid cell tumor with virilization; this association was not previously reported.

50549088549	Host and viral factors in relation to clearance of human papillomavirus infection: A cohort study in Taiwan	Human papillomavirus (HPV) persistence is essential for cervical cancer development. We accrued nested-cohort subjects from a population-based study to investigate the host and viral factors related to outcome of HPV infection. Women (age ≥ 30 years old) with HPV-positive but normal cytology and negative colposcopy were invited to participate. After signing informed consent, every participant completed a structured questionnaire and had 6-monthly follow-ups of Pap smear, HPV testing and colposcopy. Total and type-specific HPV clearance rates as well as host and viral factors associated with clearance in 3-year longitudinal follow-up were analyzed. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of progression to ≥ cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 according to baseline HPV of the women with normal cytology were calculated from national registry database. Among the 626 eligible women, 526 (median age 47, 29-75) were enrolled and 412 returned for follow-up at least once. The median follow-up of enrolled subjects was 23 months (range 6.8-39). The 3-year cumulative total HPV clearance rate was 49.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 43.3-54.7%). The median 3-year cumulative type-specific HPV clearance rate was 50.0% (range 0-100.0%) with a median time to clearance of 12.4 months (6.4-24.5). Older age was associated with significantly decreased total HPV clearance and decreased type-specific clearance in HPV-18 and -53, while high viral load was associated with decreased total and type-specific clearance. After adjusting confounding variables, the HR of developing ≥CIN2 in baseline HPV-positive women was 34.0-fold (95% CI: 15.5-74.7) as compared to HPV-negative women. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

54949140459	Prognostic factors and adjuvant therapy in uterine carcinosarcoma	Purpose of investigation: The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate prognostic variables and impact of adjuvant therapy in uterine carcinosarcoma. Methods: The clinical information and pathological confirmation were reviewed for cases with uterine carcinosarcoma from 1984 to 2005. A total of 45 patients were eligible for analysis. Results: The median follow-up for survivors was 84 months. Five-year overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 36.5% and 33.8%, respectively for Stage I-IV. Distant site metastasis with/ without pelvic failure occurred in 83.3% of those with recurrence/ progression. By multivariate analysis, older age (p = 0.001) and more than half of myometrial invasion (p = 0.002) were significant predictors of death, while only myometrial invasion (p = 0.022) was significantly associated with PFS. Stratified analyses demonstrated a monotonic trend of chemotherapy or chemoradiation to decrease death. Conclusions: Our results suggested that age and depth of myometrial invasion were significant prognostic factors, and chemotherapy or chemoradiation seemed to be beneficial for uterine carcinosarcoma.

58149175452	Multiple extragenital adenomatoid tumors in the mesocolon and omentum	Adenomatoid tumors are benign mesothelial neoplasms most commonly found in the male and female genital tracts. Extragenital adenomatoid tumors are rare, most of them being solitary tumors. To our knowledge, only one case of multiple extragenital adenomatoid tumors, involving the liver and peritoneum, has been reported to date. Here we report another case of multiple extragenital adenomatoid tumors involving the mesocolon and omentum. A 47-year-old woman presented with a delayed menstrual period. Ultrasonography revealed a left adnexal mass, and surgical resection was attempted at a local hospital. The patient was transferred to our hospital without resection due to the intraoperative finding of multiple peritoneal tumors. At our hospital, an 8.0×7.5×6.0 cm tumor at the mesocolon of the sigmoid colon and three omental nodules measuring up to 2.5×2.0×1.7 cm were resected. Grossly, they were well circumscribed, gray-tan and elastic with small cystic spaces. Microscopically, they were composed of tubules and anastomosing channels lined by flattened or cuboidal cells with bland nuclei. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for pan-cytokeratin AE1/AE3, vimentin, cytokeratin 5/6 and calretinin. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was well 10 months after the operation. Despite their rarity, adenomatoid tumors should be included in the differential diagnosis of multiple intra-abdominal tumors. © The Authors 2008.

67549103662	Prognostic factors predicting recurrence in borderline ovarian tumors	Objective: We aimed to investigate outcome of borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs) with respect to methods and extent of surgical approach and to evaluate prognostic factors. Methods: A retrospective study included consecutive patients with BOT treated from 1984 to 2008. These cases were confirmed by histological review. The influence of clinico-pathological characteristics upon recurrence and death were analyzed by independent sample t test, Chi-square test, logistic regression model, and Cox proportional hazard model. Results: A total of 233 patients were enrolled, 214 in Stage I, 11 Stage II and 8 Stage III. There were 21 relapses, only 5 of which died of disease. 5-year and 10-year overall survival were 97.6% and 96.4%, and recurrence-free survival rates (RFS) were 92.7% and 88.2%, respectively. Median follow-up time for survivors was 81 (range, 0.5-295) months. Median time to recurrence was 31 (range, 5.5-181) months. In multivariate analysis, Stage II/III, cystectomy and higher pretreatment serum CA-125 level ( ≥ 144 U/mL) were selected for a model predicting 5-year RFS, where risk factor = 0, 1, and 2-3 had odds ratios of 1, 14.9, and 113.3, respectively (p < 0.001). Replacing stage with peritoneal implants, the latter two factors along with invasive peritoneal implants were selected. Of the 5 cases died of disease, all had invasive recurrences. Initial laparoscopic or laparotomy approach had no influence on prognosis. Conclusions: Although BOT has an excellent prognosis, they are not exempted from a risk of recurrence. Stage II/III (or invasive implants), cystectomy and higher pre-operative serum CA-125 were independent variables predicting recurrence. Crown Copyright © 2009.

66349083945	Adult-onset perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive Henoch-Schönlein purpura in diabetic nephropathy	Adult-onset Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a rare systemic vasculitis characterized by a leukocytoclastic vasculitis of small vessels with the deposition of IgA immune complexes involving skin, gastrointestinal tract, joints and kidneys. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay is commonly found in other vasculitic disorders but rarely discovered in HSP patients. ANCA with perinuclear pattern has hardly ever reported in HSP patients. The diagnostic importance of ANCA still remains controversial. In addition, the simultaneous presence of diabetic nephropathy and HSP is uncommon. We present a case of an adult patient with diabetic nephropathy and superimposed HSP, which resulted in acute renal failure. Perinuclear-pattern ANCA was detected in the acute phase of HSP but disappeared when the disease resolved. Further, we have reviewed ANCA-positive HSP in this article. © Società Italiana di Nefrologia.

69049086599	Does epstein-barr virus play a role in lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the uterine cervix?	The role of Epstein-Barr viruses (EBVs) in lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) of the uterine cervix is controversial. We aimed to investigate the existence of EBV and human papillomavirus (HPV) in LELC of the cervix. Nine patients of LELC of the cervix, treated at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 1996 and 2000, with complete clinicopathologic findings and follow-up data were studied. Twenty-five patients with squamous cell carcinoma were recruited as controls. The EBV genome was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. HPV genotyping was carried out by SPF1/GP6+ PCR and hybridization with a GeneChip. Type-specific E6 PCR of the 18 most commonly found HPV genotypes in Taiwan was also performed. HPV-16 was found in 3 cases, HPV-18, HPV-31, and HPV-35, and HPV-58 in 1 case each. One case showed positive for both HPV-16 and HPV-58. Low copy number of EBV DNA was found in 9 cases of LELC (1-14.7 copies/μg) and 7 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (3.8-1586 copies/μg) using real-time quantitative PCR Bam H1 W fragment probe, but EBV-encoded RNAin situ hybridization was negative in tumor cells. Therefore, positive rates for EBV and HPV were 0% and 88.9% (8/9) in LELC of the cervix, respectively. All patients with LELC of the cervix had no evidence of disease for more than 5 years from diagnoses. Our results suggest that EBV is not involved in the carcinogenesis of so-called LELC of the cervix but the EBV sequences might exist in a florid inflammatory stromal component. © 2009 International Society of Gynecological Pathologists.

6944242983	Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging evaluation for breast cancers after sonographically guided core-needle biopsy: A comparison study	Background: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for preoperative assessment of palpable breast cancer after sonographically guided percutaneous core-needle biopsy. Methods: Thirty-six breast cancers in 35 women that had been diagnosed by sonographically guided core-needle biopsy prior to subsequent MRI were evaluated in this retrospective study. Radiological and pathological reports, multiplicity, retroareolar involvement, and the size of the breast cancers were reviewed. The cancer sizes, as derived from sonography and enhanced MRI, were correlated with histological size in greatest diameter by means of Pearson's correlation. The threshold value for significance was set at P < .05. Results: Synchronous breast cancers were revealed in the index cases by means of enhanced MRI (10), sonography (8), and mammography (7). Two of the 36 index cancers (5.6%) benefited from MRI assessment. Retroareolar cancer extension was observed with enhanced MRI in five index cancers. Of these, one was also noted on both a sonogram and a mammogram. Four of the index cancers (11.1%) benefited from the enhanced MRI. Overall, five index cancers (13.9%) benefited from the enhanced MRI. With a gold standard of histology, the mean cancer sizes were underestimated by sonography and overestimated by enhanced MRI. In comparison with sonography, a stronger association was noted between MRI and histological measurements, with coefficients of 0.657 and 0.882, respectively (P < .001). Conclusions: In a clinical setting, MRI for preoperative assessment of breast cancers is warranted. Minimally invasive, percutaneous core-needle biopsy did not alter the clinical efficacy of the MRI evaluation.

0035044141	Cerebellar metastasis from papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary mimicking ménière's disease: A case report	BACKGROUND: In rare cases, cerebellar metastasis originating in serous papillary adenocarcinoma of the ovary can mimick Ménière's disease. CASE: A 51-year-old woman, with complete remission after optimal maximal debulking and chemotherapy for an International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics IIIc primary ovarian carcinoma, presented with nausea, vomiting, vertigo and headache 18 months after surgery. Investigations revealed a solitary cerebellar cystic mass, 4.6×4.0×3.2 cm. Gross total excision of the cerebellar lesion followed by brain irradiation resulted in complete resolution of her symptoms. Histology showed a metastatic tumor consistent with the primary ovarian carcinoma. CONCLUSION: In an atypical presentation in patients with metastatic ovarian carcinoma, thorough investigations should be done to rule out or confirm brain metastasis, which can be aggressively managed to prevent serious consequences and improve outcome.

0035056379	Value of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing after conization in the prediction of residual disease in the subsequent hysterectomy specimen	OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing after conization in predicting residual disease in the subsequent hysterectomy specimen. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study was conducted on 75 patients with grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia who had cone margins or endocervical curettage specimens showing disease and who elected to undergo hysterectomy after conization. All patients underwent high-risk human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing by the Hybrid Capture II (Digene Corporation, Gaithersburg, MD) system before conization and at the time of hysterectomy (within 2-7 weeks after conization). The presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in cells obtained by endocervical brush before hysterectomy was correlated with residual disease in the hysterectomy specimens. RESULTS: Of the 92 patients enrolled, 75 were eligible. Of these 75 patients, 52 (69.3%) had persistent human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid after conization, and 27 (36.0%) of the 75 patients had residual cervical neoplasia in the hysterectomy specimens. Those with negative results for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid after conization were all (23/23) without residual disease in the uterus (100% negative predictive value). All those who had residual disease (27/27) had positive results for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid at the time of hysterectomy (100% sensitivity). Postconization human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid status (odds ratio, 4.000; 95% confidence interval, 1.531-10.449; P = .005) and grade of dysplasia after endocervical curettage (classified as grade 2 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or less severe disease vs grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: odds ratio, 6.612; 95% confidence interval, 2.837-15.409; P = .0002) were significantly associated with residual tumor in the uterus. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study confirms an excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing after conization in predicting residual cervical neoplasia. A strategy of managing patients with grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, based on postconization human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid findings and endocervical curettage results, is proposed.

0035095574	Nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma in children: Report of 2 cases with review of the literature	Hamartoma in the nasal cavity of children is especially rare. Most documented cases occurred in infants, with characteristic histologic features of a mixture of various mesenchymal tissues. McDermott et al designated it nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma in 1998, and it has since been considered a distinct clinicopathological entity. We report 2 such examples in a full-term male newborn and a 9-month-old boy, respectively. Histologically, both cases were characterized by a mixture of various mesenchymal elements, including spindle cells, collagen fibers, and irregular islands of osseous and chondroid tissue. Immunohistochemical study showed positivity to vimentin and S100 protein. Ultrastructural examination of case 1 demonstrated fibroblastic and myofibroblastic differentiation in tumor cells. There were 11 cases of nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma in children published to date. The tumor has a benign biological behavior, and complete resection is the treatment of choice. It is apt to be misdiagnosed because of overlapping histologic features shared with a number of benign and malignant soft tissue tumors. Awareness of this entity is essential for correct diagnosis and adequate therapy.

0035150412	High prevalence of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and microinvasive carcinoma in women with a cytologic diagnosis of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the histologic nature of low grade intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) in a region with a high prevalence of invasive cervical carcinoma and to propose a management protocol. STUDY DESIGN: Comparing the follow-up of 877 women with LSIL during a 43-month period, taking into consideration the histologic nature determined by colposcopic biopsy, endocervical curettage, conization or hysterectomy as the final pathologic diagnosis. RESULTS: During the study period, from July 1994 to February 1998, a total of 128,925 Pap smears were performed at our institute, with 877 (0.68%) diagnosed as LSIL. Among these, 722 women with CIN1-SIL and 32 with human papillomavirus-related changes (HPV-SIL) were enrolled in the study. Of the 543 women with CIN 1/squamous intraepithelial lesion, 145 (27%) cases of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion were disclosed histologically, as were 16 (3%) cases of microinvasion. Among those followed at an interval of three months with a Pap smear alone, the persistence rate was 46.8%, while the regression rate was 40%. Thirty-two women with HPV/SIL underwent histologic evaluation, revealing 18% CIN 2/3 with no microinvasion. CONCLUSION: A high percentage of CIN 2/3 as well as microinvasive lesions will go unnoticed in the absence of colposcopic evaluation.

0035159218	Lymphatic tumor emboli of perirenal fat in patient with nephrotic syndrome receiving renal biopsy, ultimately revealed gastric adenocarcinoma with membranous glomerulonephritis	The association of malignancy with nephrotic syndrome and renal histopathologic abnormalities is well documented. Paraneoplastic proteinuria caused by membranous glomerulonephritis usually is made simultaneously with the diagnosis of a malignant tumor, or the two conditions are diagnosed within a year of each other. We reported a patient who presented with nephrotic syndrome initially. Incidentally, in kidney specimens, pathologic findings showed perirenal fatty tissue with malignancy tumor emboli in lymphatics. Thereafter, gastric adenocarcinoma was diagnosed by gastrointestinal panendoscopy with gastric biopsy under impression of malignancy associated with glomerulonephritis. Patient died of complications of malignancy-related disseminated intravascular coagulation without chemotherapy after confirming diagnosis was made three months later.

0035199734	Intralesional injection for hepatic metastasis from cervical carcinoma: A report of two cases	BACKGROUND: The treatment of isolated hepatic metastasis from carcinoma of the uterine cervix has yet to be established. We tested the efficacy of percutaneous injection of ethanol and acetic acid as a curative-intent treatment modality for this rare event. CASES: Under real-time sonographic guidance, two patients with a solitary hepatic metastasis from carcinoma of the cervix were treated with 99.5% percutaneous ethanol injection (one patient) and 50% percutaneous acetic acid injection (the other patient). The treatment was repeated weekly if laboratory data permitted and aspiration cytology interpreted on site showed tumor cells. Cytology after complete treatment showed no residual tumor cells in either case. Both patients had no evidence of disease during follow-up for 12 and 24 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: Treatment was successful in two patients with isolated hepatic metastastic lesions from carcinoma of the cervix who received percutaneous injection of 99.5% ethanol or 50% acetic acid.

73649132953	A Prospective Randomized Trial to Study the Impact of Pretreatment FDG-PET for Cervical Cancer Patients With MRI-Detected Positive Pelvic but Negative Para-Aortic Lymphadenopathy	Purpose: This prospective randomized study was undertaken to determine the possible impact of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) on extrapelvic metastasis detection, radiation field design, and survival outcome for cervical cancer patients with enlarged pelvic nodes on MRI image. Methods and Materials: Inclusion criteria were patients with newly diagnosed Stage I-IVA cervical cancer and with positive pelvic but negative para-aortic lymph nodes (PALN) as detected by magnetic resonance image and good performance status for concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either pretreatment FDG-PET (study group) or not (control group). Whole pelvis was the standard irradiation field for the control group and those with no extrapelvic findings on PET. The radiation fields for the rest of the study group were extended to include the PALN region or were modified according to the extrapelvic PET finding. Results: From January 2002 to April 2006, 129 patients were included, and 66 of them were randomized to receive FDG-PET. PET detected seven extrapelvic metastases (11%, 6 PALN and 1 omental node), and four of them remained disease-free after treatment modification. For patients who underwent PET compared with those who did not, there were no differences in the 4-year rates of overall survival (79% vs. 85%, p = 0.65), disease-free survival (75 % vs. 77%, p = 0.64), and distant metastasis-free survival (82% vs. 78%, p = 0.83). Conclusions: Pretreatment FDG-PET in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging can improve the detection of extrapelvic metastasis, mainly PALN, and help select patients for extended-field radiotherapy. However, the addition of FDG-PET may not translate into survival benefit, even though PALN relapses are reduced. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

77949873402	Decreased expression of microRNA-199b increases protein levels of SET (protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor) in human choriocarcinoma	We compared microRNA profiles between choriocarcinoma and non-cancerous trophoblasts, and revealed that miR-199b was underexpressed in choriocarcinoma. By computational prediction and microarray studies, SET (protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor) was shown to be one of the target genes regulated by miR-199b. Ectopic expression of miR-199b inhibited endogenous SET protein levels and the activity of the luciferase reporter containing the 3′-UTR of SET. Further comparisons of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human choriocarcinoma, mole, and non-cancer trophoblast tissues confirmed the initial findings of low miR-199b expression and SET upregulation in choriocarcinomas, suggesting that microRNA-dysregulated SET protein may account for the rapid growth seen with choriocarcinomas. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77950187729	Defining detection threshold and improving analytical proficiency of HPV testing in clinical specimens	Objective: Previous studies have shown that SPF1/GP6+ PCR followed by HPV Blot has high sensitivity and high reproducibility for the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV). However, there have been reports of false-negative results. In the present study we endeavoured to improve the diagnostic performance of HPV DNA testing in cervical swab specimens. We also aimed to identify viral load thresholds. Methods: We examined DNA from cervical swabs of 7 women with a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) who were negative by HPV DNA testing. For control purposes, 106 cytology negative/HPV-negative samples were included. PCR was performed with either 1 μL of DNA solution or different amounts of input DNA (25, 50, and 100 ng). We tested two different commercial alkaline phosphatases (ALPs) at two distinct reaction times. The overall conclusions were based on HPV Blot, type-specific PCR, direct sequencing, and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results: All seven patients with CIN2+ disease turned HPV-positive when 100 ng of input DNA and E6 type-specific PCR were used. Discrepant and false-negative results were obtained using different amounts of input DNA. Different commercial ALPs showed a significant impact on detection performance. Analysis of viral load indicated that the detection threshold for HPV infection using SPF1/GP6+ PCR plus HPV Blot was approximately 10

77953475925	Expression pattern and prognostic significance of claudins 1, 4, and 7 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Claudins are major tight junction proteins that regulate the integrity and function of tight junctions. Aberrant expression of claudins has been shown in various carcinomas with diverse prognostic implications. However, their expression pattern and prognostic value have not been investigated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This is the first study to characterize the expression pattern of claudins 1, 4, and 7 in a cohort of 176 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and a minimum follow-up of 9.4 years. Immunohistochemistry with semiquantitative assessment of expression of claudins 1, 4, and 7 was performed on 176 biopsy specimens. Results were correlated with sex, age, extent of tumor, lymph node status, the presence or absence of distant metastasis, and patient survival. High expression of claudins 1 and 4 (72.2% and 88.1%) and low expression of claudin 7 (82.4%) were frequently detected. Low claudin 4 expression (P = .020) and high claudin 7 expression (P < .001) were associated with distant metastasis. Elevated claudin 7 expression also correlated with high tumor stage (P = .001). Furthermore, decreased claudin 4 expression (P = .003) and increased claudin 7 expression (P < .001) independently predicted shorter distant metastasis-free survival by Cox regression analysis. Claudin 4 and claudin 7 may be a novel biomarker for the prediction of distant metastasis and unfavorable prognosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

78249288431	Survival impact of initial surgical approach in stage I ovarian cancer	Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on survival of initial laparoscopic surgery compared with conventional laparotomy in stage I epithelial ovarian cancer. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study which enrolled all consecutive patients with stage I epithelial ovarian cancer between January 1984 and December 2006. Patients with a histological diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer who underwent laparoscopy were recruited if their cases were compatible with stage I (clinical or surgical) at initial exploration. The independent samples t test, chi-square test, log-rank and Cox proportional hazards model were performed. Results: A total of 208 patients were enrolled, including 34 patients with initial laparoscopy and 174 with laparotomy. The median follow-up time for survivors was 65 (range, 2-276) months. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 67.4% and 69.5% in the laparoscopy group, and 88.7% and 78.7% in the laparotomy group, respectively. The median time to recurrence was 14.5 (range, 2-67) months. In multivariate analysis, the initial laparoscopy approach posted significant adverse impacts on the OS (laparoscopy vs laparotomy, the hazard ratio [HR]: 3.52, p = 0.009) and the RFS (laparoscopy vs laparotomy, HR: 2.58, p = 0.024), while a higher substage (stage IB-IC vs IA, HR: 8.29, p = 0.040) was associated with only a worse OS, and its impact on the RFS was marginal. Conclusion: An initial laparoscopy intervention and higher substage posted significant adverse effects on the prognosis in stage I epithelial ovarian cancer. Important precautions when using laparoscopy for adnexal masses, such as avoiding rupture, applying protection, and submitting frozen sections, are recommended.

78649867180	Human papillomavirus genotype in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 and 3 of Taiwanese women	We aimed to assess the distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in high-grade cervical lesions in Taiwan. The study included 1,086 paraffin-embedded, formaldehyde-fixed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 specimens. HPV genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. Multiple HPV types were validated by E6 type-specific PCR, direct sequencing and/or real-time PCR. HPV DNA was detected in 995 (91.6%) specimens, and multiple HPV types were identified in 192 (19.3%) samples. The leading HPV types were HPV16 (24%), HPV52 (20%), HPV58 (20%), HPV33 (13%), HPV31 (8%) and HPV18 (4.6%). Although the leading six types consisted of 87.6%, HPV16 or 18 comprised only 30.9%. The prevalence of different HPV types showed a significant association with age. In women older than 50 yr, HPV16 and 18 comprised 21.3% (83/389), while HPV52, 58 and 33 represented 55.5% (216/389). In women aged less than 50 yr, HPV16 and 18 comprised 32.1% (224/697, p < 0.0001), while HPV 52, 58 and 33 represented 47.9% (334/697, p = 0.02). The distribution of HPV genotypes was compared with previously reported findings for Taiwanese women with cervical cancer (CC). The overall HPV16 positivity rate was significantly higher in CC than in CIN 2/3 (odds ratio: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.91-2.40). In addition, HPV18, 39 and 45 were significantly overrepresented in CC, whereas HPV52, 58, 33, 31, 35, 51 and 53 were underrepresented. We concluded that an effective vaccine against the most common HPV types could prevent a significant proportion of cervical cancer cases that occur in Taiwan. Copyright © 2010 UICC.

79952844385	A comparison of spring-loaded and vacuum-assisted techniques for stereotactic breast biopsy of impalpable microcalcification lesions: Experience at chang gung memorial hospital at Linkou	Background: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of stereotactic core needle breast biopsy using spring-loaded or vacuum-assisted techniques or impalpable microcalcification lesions in Taiwanese women. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who received stereotactic core needle breast biopsy for impalpable mammographic microcalcification lesions from January 1999 to February 2009. The accuracy, false negative rate, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) upgrade rate and rate of concordance with biopsy procedures were determined. We also compared the diagnostic performance between the vacuum-assisted and spring-loaded techniques. Results: A total of 335 breast stereotactic core needle biopsy procedures (218 by spring-loaded and 117 by vacuum-assisted technique) were enrolled for analysis. The overall accuracy, false negative rate, DCIS upgrade rate and concordance rate with stereotactic core needle biopsy were 88.5%, 17.3%, 23.1% and 83.8% respectively. The vacuum-assisted technique yielded better results than the spring-loaded technique in accuracy (100% vs. 84%), and the false negative (7.1% vs. 21%), DCIS upgrade (0% vs. 37.5%), and concordance rates (95% vs. 79.6%). Conclusion: Stereotactic core needle biopsy is a feasible technique in diagnosing impalpable microcalcification lesions of the breast in Taiwanese women. The diagnostic performance of the vacuum-assisted technique was better than that of the spring-loaded technique.

79955623034	Long-term outcome and prognostic factors for adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma of cervix after definitive radiotherapy	Purpose: To study the outcomes of patients with adenocarcinoma/ adenosquamous carcinoma (AC/ASC) of the cervix primarily treated with radiotherapy (RT), identify the prognostic factors, and evaluate the efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) or salvage surgery. Methods and Materials: A total of 148 patients with Stage I-IVA AC/ASC of cervix after full-course definitive RT were included. Of the 148 patients, 77% had advanced stage disease. Treatment failure was categorized as either distant or local failure. Local failure was further separated into persistent tumor or local relapse after complete remission. The effectiveness of CCRT with cisplatin and/or paclitaxel was examined, and the surgical salvage rate for local failure was reviewed. Results: The 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 68%, 38%, 49%, 30%, and 0% for those with Stage IB/IIA nonbulky, IB/IIA bulky, IIB, III, and IVA disease, respectively, and appeared inferior to that of those with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix treated using the same RT protocol. Incomplete tumor regression after RT, a low hemoglobin level, and positive lymph node metastasis were independent poor prognostic factors for relapse-free survival. CCRT with weekly cisplatinum did not improve the outcome for our AC/ASC patients. Salvage surgery rescued 30% of patients with persistent disease. Conclusion: Patients with AC/ASC of the cervix primarily treated with RT had inferior outcomes compared to those with squamous cell carcinoma. Incomplete tumor regression after RT was the most important prognostic factor for local failure. Salvage surgery for patients with persistent tumor should be encouraged for selected patients. Our results did not demonstrate a benefit of CCRT with cisplatin for this disease. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We report on a 13-year-old boy admitted to our hospital with an initial complaint of bilateral knee pain and multiple petechiae on both lower extremities. Diagnosis of atypical HUS was established according to the clinical triad of HUS without a veriotoxin-producing organism in his stool and the pathological finding compatible to thrombotic microangiopathy. In addition, his symptoms fulfilled the 1982 revised criteria for the classification of SLE. After methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide pulse therapies, his laboratory findings and general condition improved. No plasmapheresis or any plasma infusion was required.

0036301353	Sonographic evaluation of mammographically detected microcalcifications without a mass prior to stereotactic core needle biopsy	Purpose. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of sonographically re-evaluating areas of microcalcification found mammographically before undertaking stereotactic core needle biopsy (SCNB). Methods. Patients with nonpalpable breast lesions appearing as microcalcifications on mammograms and who had been referred to us for SCNB were re-evaluated sonographically before the procedure. None of the breast lesions had been associated with a density on the mammograms, and the initial sonographic evaluations had been negative. Using the mammograms for correlation, we meticulously re-evaluated the areas of microcalcifications sonographically using a high-frequency linear-array transducer. The sonographic and histopathologic results were then reviewed and correlated. The sonographic findings and visibility of the mammographically detected microcalcifications were analyzed by the 2-tailed Fisher's exact test and the chi-square test. Results. Sixty-six patients, who had 68 cases of microcalcifications, were enrolled. Thirteen of the 66 patients underwent surgery, and 9 of the 13 were found to have breast carcinoma. In the sonographic re-evaluation before SCNB in these 9 patients, an associated soft tissue mass was demonstrated in 5 patients but not in the other 4. Sonographic re-evaluation also revealed abnormalities in 24 of 68 cases (35.3%), in contrast to the negative findings on the initial sonography. Using the chi-square test to identify a trend, we found that the percentage of cases that were sonographically visible was highest for clustered benign microcalcifications and lowest for segmental benign microcalcifications (p < 0.0001). Conclusions. In breast lesions that appear as microcalcifications without an associated mass on mammograms, pre-SCNB sonographic re-evaluation with a high-frequency transducer can depict microcalcifications, particularly the clustered ones, and can detect small associated masses. Although the absence of a sonographically detectable mass in areas of mammographically detected microcalcifications does not guarantee the absence of cancer, the presence of an associated mass on sonography should warrant close follow-up in the case of negative results to avoid a delay in the diagnosis of breast carcinoma. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

0036679533	Choriocarcinoma with diffuse intraabdominal abscess and disseminated intravascular coagulation: A case report	BACKGROUND: Management of choriocarcinoma complicated by diffused intraabdominal abscess is difficult, especially when disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) ensues. CASE: A 29-year-old woman presented with massive vaginal bleeding, fever and severe abdominal pain. Choriocarcinoma with pulmonary and vaginal metastases was diagnosed along with diffused intraabdominal abscess. Hysterectomy and hypogastric artery ligation were performed after the fever and abdominal symptoms failed to respond to intravenous antibiotics. Although the patient developed DIC after surgery, transfusion, antibiotics and immediate combination chemotherapy improved her condition and controlled the malignancy. She was free of disease for >20 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: Timely surgery, aggressive antibiotics and immediate postoperative chemotherapy are recommended for patients with choriocarcinoma complicated by intraabdominal abscess and DIC.

0036680557	Postoperative low-pelvic irradiation for stage I-IIA cervical cancer patients with risk factors other than pelvic lymph node metastasis	Purpose: To retrospectively investigate whether postoperative low-pelvic radiotherapy (RT) is an appropriate treatment for node-negative, high-risk Stage I-IIA cervical cancer patients. Methods and Materials: A total of 228 Stage I-IIA cervical cancer patients treated by radical surgery and postoperative RT were included in this study. All patients had histopathologically negative pelvic node metastasis, but at least one of the following risk factors: parametrial involvement, positive or close resection margins, invasion depth two-thirds or greater cervical stromal thickness. Seventy-nine patients (35%) received 30-50 Gy (median 44) to whole pelvis and a boost dose to the low pelvis (whole-pelvic RT group); the other 149 patients (65%) received low-pelvic RT only (low-pelvic RT group). For both groups, the total external RT dose to the low pelvis ranged from 40 to 60 Gy (median 50). The potential factors associated with survival, small bowel (gastrointestinal) complications, and leg lymphedema were analyzed, and patients who had a relapse in the upper pelvis were identified. Results: The 5-year overall and disease-specific survival rate was 84% and 86%, respectively. After multivariate analysis, only bulky tumor (≥4 cm) and non-squamous cell carcinoma were significantly associated with survival. Parametrial involvement, lymph-vascular invasion, ≤50.4 Gy to the low pelvis, positive or close margins, and low-pelvic RT alone did not significantly affect survival. Grade I-V small bowel complications occurred in 33 patients (15%). Whole pelvic RT and >50.4 Gy to the low pelvis, but not old age and treatment technique (AP-PA vs. box), were significantly associated with gastrointestinal complications. Three patients (2%) in the low-pelvic RT group and 6 patients (8%) in the whole-pelvic RT group were found to have Grade III or higher small bowel complications (p = 0.023). Thirty-one percent of patients developed lymphedema of the leg. A dose to the low pelvis >50.4 Gy and an AP-PA field, but not whole-pelvic RT, old age, or the number of sampled lymph nodes, were associated with lymphedema of the leg. Five patients (3.6%) of the low-pelvic RT group and none of the whole-pelvic RT group developed upper pelvis relapse. Three of these 5 patients had upper pelvic relapse alone. Conclusion: Compared with whole-pelvic RT plus low-pelvic boost, low-pelvic RT alone significantly reduces the small bowel complications in node-negative, high-risk, Stage I-IIA cervical cancer patients. Although low-pelvic RT alone increases the incidence of upper pelvic relapse, its effect on survival is not substantial. Low-pelvic RT alone appears to be an appropriate treatment method for this group of patients. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

0036498858	Prediction of supraclavicular lymph node metastasis in breast carcinoma	Purpose: Supraclavicular lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients has a poor prognosis, and aggressive local treatment has usually resulted in severe morbidity. The purpose of this study was to select high-risk neck metastasis patients for prophylactic radiotherapy. Methods: Between 1990 and 1998, 2658 consecutive invasive breast cancer patients underwent surgery and adjuvant therapy in the hospital. The median age was 47 years (range 22-92). The median follow-up period was 39 months. The following factors were analyzed: age, tumor size, tumor location, histologic type, histologic grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, DNA flow cytometry study results, number of positive axillary lymph nodes, use of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy, and level of involved axillary nodes. Results: Of the 2658 patients, 113 (4.3%) developed supraclavicular lymph node metastasis during this period. Young age (≤40 years), tumor size >3 cm, high histologic grade, angiolymphatic invasion, negative estrogen receptor status, synthetic phase fraction >4%, >4 positive nodes, and level II or III involved nodes were all significant for predicting neck metastasis in the univariate analysis. Three predictive factors were significant after multivariate analysis: high histologic grade, >4 positive nodes, and axillary level II or III involved nodes. In patients with axillary level I involved nodes and ≤4 positive nodes, the incidence was 4.4%. If axillary level III was involved, the rate of supraclavicular lymph node metastasis was 15.1%. Conclusion: The incidence of supraclavicular lymph node metastasis was higher in the groups with >4 positive nodes and in those with axillary level II or III involved nodes. Selective use of comprehensive radiotherapy for these high-risk patients will achieve good locoregional control. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

80053466700	Imaging findings in mandibular primitive neuroectodermal tumour: A report of a rare case and review of the literature	Primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNETs) are aggressive undifferentiated tumours that occur mainly in the central nervous system (CNS). Reviewing the literature, only six cases of primary PNET of the mandible have been reported. These rare tumours are usually overlooked in clinical practice. An 18-year-old woman who presented with dental caries and left cheek swelling was initially diagnosed with facial cellulitis, but the swelling persisted despite adequate intravenous antibiotic therapy. Subsequent ultrasound and MR examinations revealed a tumour originating from the left mandibular ramus. The ultrasonography-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of peripheral PNET. The radiographic features of mandibular PNETs are similar to those of PNETs in other regions, except for haemorrhage, necrosis and calcification. In addition, this is the first reported case with sonographic and MR images of this rare tumour, and the first case that was diagnosed based on the ultrasonography-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy. Using these image characteristics, mandibular PNETs can be diagnosed more accurately. © 2011 The British Institute of Radiology.

84856960678	Regulation of ovarian cancer progression by microRNA-187 through targeting Disabled homolog-2	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in tumorigenesis by regulating oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. In this study, miR-187 and miR-200a were found to be expressed at higher levels in ovarian cancers than in benign tumors. In patients with ovarian cancer, however, higher levels of miR-187 and miR-200a expression were paradoxically associated with better OS and recurrence-free survival. Further, multivariate analysis showed that miR-187 served as an independent prognostic factor for patients with ovarian cancer (n176). Computational prediction and microarray results indicated that miR-187 directly targeted Disabled homolog-2 (Dab2), and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that the target site of miR-187 was located at the 3′-UTR of the Dab2 gene. Generally considered as a tumor-suppressor gene, Dab2 may actually promote tumor progression in advanced cancers through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Ectopic expression of miR-187 in cancer cells promoted cell proliferation, but continued overexpression of miR-187 suppressed Dab2 and inhibited migration. Suppression of miR-187 upregulated Dab2, which, by inhibiting E-cadherin levels while stimulating vimentin and phospho-FAK levels, promoted EMT. Reduced ovarian cancer Dab2 histoscores correlated with high miR-187 levels and improved outcomes of patients. Collectively, these results demonstrate distinct dual roles of Dab2 in cell proliferation and tumor progression. In the initial steps of tumorigenesis, upregulated miR-187 suppresses Dab2, promoting cell proliferation. During the later stages, however, continued increased levels of miR-187 inhibits the Dab2-dependent EMT that is associated with tumor invasiveness, which is presumed to be the reason why cancers with high miR-187 levels were associated with better survivals. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84862491203	Favorable outcome of secondary axillary dissection in breast cancer patients with axillary nodal relapse	Purpose. Little evidence can be found about the long-term outcome of breast cancer patients after axillary lymph node recurrence (ALNR) and its survival benefit after different kinds of management. The present study intends to evaluate the risk factors associated with axillary recurrence after definite surgery for primary breast cancer. The prognosis after ALNR and particularly outcome of different management methods also were studied. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed data from 4,473 patients who were diagnosed with primary breast cancer and received surgical intervention in a single institute from January 1990 to December 2002. Medical files were reviewed and data on survival were updated annually. Risk factors and prognosis of patients with axillary recurrence were analyzed. Breast-cancer-specific survival of patients with ALNR and outcomes after different management methods also were studied. Results. After a median follow-up of 70.2 months, axillary recurrence developed in 0.8% of patients. Factors associated with ALNR included: age younger than 40 years, medial tumor location, no initial standard level I & II axillary dissection, and not receiving hormonal therapy. The 5-year breast-cancer- specific survival after ALNR was 57.9%. For patients who received further axillary dissection, the 5-year survival rate was 82.5% compared with 44.9% for patients who did not receive further dissection. Conclusions. ALNR is a rare event in treating breast cancer. Young age at diagnosis and medially located tumor are associated with higher risk, but standardized initial axillary dissection to level II and adjuvant hormonal therapy is protective against ALNR. In patients with ALNR, the outcome is not dismal and survival may be improved if further axillary dissection is given. © Society of Surgical Oncology 2011.

84863081056	Age factor and implication of human papillomavirus type-specific prevalence in women with normal cervical cytology	The prevalence and genotype distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in women with normal cervical cytology varies widely according to the population studied. Two non-overlapping population-based cohort studies of women aged ≥30 years for the periods 2008-2009 (n=5026) and 2004-2005 (n=10 014) were analysed. The prevalence rate of HPV was 11·0% (95% CI 10·5-11·6). HPV infection was significantly associated with age, menopausal status, and inversely associated with hormone replacement therapy. There was an increasing trend of Î±3/Î±15, Î±5/Î±6, and multiple HPV infections with increasing age. The five most common types were HPV52, 18, 53, 58 and 70, while HPV16, 31, 33 ranked 21st, 25th, and 16th, respectively, in the merged cohort with normal cytology (n=14 724). HPV16, 31, and 33 were significantly associated with abnormal cytology, which could have resulted in their rarity in the total merged cohort (n=15 040). © 2011 Cambridge University Press.

84865028651	Immune responses during healing of massive segmental femoral bone defects mediated by hybrid baculovirus-engineered ASCs	Baculovirus holds promise for genetic modification of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and bone engineering. To explore the immune responses during bone healing and the cell fate, ASCs were mock-transduced (Mock group), transduced with the baculovirus transiently expressing growth factors promoting osteogenesis (BMP2) or angiogenesis (VEGF) (S group), or transduced with hybrid baculoviruses persistently expressing BMP2/VEGF (L group). After allotransplantation into massive femoral defects in rabbits, these 3 groups triggered similar degrees of transient inflammatory response (e.g. neutrophil proliferation and immune cell infiltration into the graft site), revealing that baculovirus and transgene products did not exacerbate the inflammation. The cells in all 3 groups underwent apoptosis initially, persisted for at least 4 weeks and were eradicated thereafter. The L group prolonged the in vivo BMP2/VEGF expression (up to 4 weeks), extended the antibody responses, and slightly enhanced the cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Nonetheless, the L group led to remarkably better bone healing and remodeling than the Mock and S groups. These data confirmed that the ASCs engineered with the hybrid BV imparted prolonged expression of BMP2/VEGF which, although stimulated low levels of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, essentially augmented the healing of massive segmental bone defects. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

0036812711	Clinical evaluation of a new model of self-obtained method for the assessment of genital human papilloma virus infection in an underserved population	Background: We designed a self-sampling method to collect exfoliated genital cells for human papilloma virus (HPV) detection. The aim was to assess whether it was suitable as an assistant tool for the early detection of cervical pre-cancer and cancer in a special category of the women who are not frequently screened for cervical cancer. Methods: We compared the results of HPV detection that were self-obtained and physician-obtained cervical swabs from the same patient that were analyzed using hybrid capture II assay. The diagnostic rate of cervical pre-cancer and cancer between self-obtained method and physician-obtained method were analyzed. Results: A total of 1194 women were prospectively registered from September 1997 through September 1999. Among them, 144 (12.1%) of self-test samples and 155 (13%) of physician-obtained samples were oncogenetic associatedHPV positive. Statistically, no significant differences existed in the screening rate for cervical cancer using either the self-collected samples or the physician-obtained samples (p> .05). The sensitivity of cervical precancer or cancer detection using self-obtained HPV testing was higher (96.3%) as compared with the Pap smear (79.2%) (p< .02). Conclusion: The detection correlation of the HPV test between the self-obtained method and physician-obtained method was 93%. Our results indicated that self-sampling was a reliable method for testing for HPV. The identification of HPV infection through the self-obtained method can be used in early identification of high-risk women with cervical precancer and cancer especially in underserved populations.

0037322635	Pathological analysis of congenital cervical cysts in children: 20 Years of experience at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital	Background: Congenital cervical cysts are frequently encountered in pediatric populations, and constitute one of the most intriguing areas of pediatric pathology. This report analyzes cervical cysts in Taiwanese children diagnosed at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) over the past 20 years. The pathologic and clinical findings are reviewed. Methods: Files on 331 patients under the age of 18 years, with a diagnosis of congenital cervical cyst at CGMH from January 1, 1983 to June 30, 2002, were retrieved from the Department of Pathology. There were 204 boys and 127 girls. We reviewed the histology of all cases and correlated it with clinical information in the medical records. Results: Thyroglossal duct cysts, the most common congenital neck cyst, accounted for 54.68% of all cases, followed by cystic hygromas (25.08%), branchial cleft cysts (16.31%), bronchogenic cysts (0.91%), and thymic cysts (0.30%). Nine cases (2.72%) remained unclassified. Conclusions: This is the largest series regarding pediatric cervical cysts in the literature to date. Thyroglossal duct cysts were the most common congenital cervical cyst encountered. Our experience indicates that each type of cyst has its unique location in the neck and is highly associated with its embryonic origin. Complete and precise clinical information is a prerequisite in order for pathologists to make accurate diagnoses of congenital cervical cysts.

0037089666	Fertility-preserving treatment in young patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma	BACKGROUND. Hormone therapy alone for early-stage, low-grade endometrial carcinoma arising in young women has been reported occasionally in case reports or small series. However, a comprehensive guideline for selection, treatment, and follow-up is not available as yet. METHODS. In the current study, the authors' evaluated the outcome of a cohort of young women with clinically diagnosed endometrial adenocarcinoma Stage IA, Grade 1 who were selected for fertility-preserving treatment by stringent staging procedures and treated in a standard protocol using combinations of megestrol acetate, tamoxifen, and gonadotropin- releasing hormone analog (GnRHa). RESULTS. Nine eligible patients were treated between 1991 and 1999. The median age of the patients was 32 years (range, 30-39 years). Of the 9 patients, 8 (88.9%) achieved complete remission after hormone therapy. Four patients had ever conceived (two patients had three term pregnancies and underwent consolidation hysterectomy after completion of family planning). Only one patient underwent hysterectomy for failure to respond, whose tumor was estrogen receptor (ER)/ progesterone receptor (PgR) positive by immunostaining but negative by ligand-binding method. Another patient, whose tumor was ER negative/PgR positive, had residual carcinoma on the first assessment and achieved complete remission after replacement of tamoxifen with a GnRHa. Four responders later developed recurrent endometrial carcinoma. One underwent immediate hysterectomy. Two were successfully re-treated with hormone therapy, but the other did not respond and underwent hysterectomy. All nine patients have been alive without evidence of disease 25-113 (median, 69) months from initial diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS. The treatment strategy described in the current study is feasible. A larger multicenter trial of fertility- preserving treatment is warranted for nulliparous young patients with well selected Stage I, Grade 1, endometrial adenocarcinoma. © 2002 American Cancer Society.

0037368147	Monitoring the size and response of locally advanced breast cancers to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (weekly paclitaxel and epirubicin) with serial enhanced MRI	Purpose. To determine if early cancer size reduction seen on enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can serve as a response predictor and to correlate final tumor sizes on MRI and excised gross tumor size to microscopic findings in patients with locally advanced breast cancers treated with preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods and materials. Thirty-three patients with advanced breast cancer entered this prospective chemotherapeutic study. Serial, dynamic, enhanced MRI was performed before chemotherapy induction, after the first course of chemotherapy and after the third course of chemotherapy prior to surgery. Responses were measured by image subtraction of tumor size on subsequent axial MRIs using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). Early tumor size reduction, percentage of relative early tumor size reduction and final tumor size response were calculated and analyzed statistically. Sizes of residual tumors measured on MRI and gross tumors in excised breasts were correlated with microscopic findings. Results. Based on tumor sizes measured with enhanced MRI, four complete responders (CR), 19 partial responders (PR) and 10 non-responder were documented. Twelve (52%) of the 23 responders (CR and PR) had reached the criteria for PR (≥30% size reduction) after the first course of chemotherapy. All CR had a marked early size reduction (ESR) of more than 45%. Using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, a good cutoff point for early tumor size reduction was 7.4 cm, with a false positive rate of 0.1 and a false negative rate of 0.13. The percentage of ESR was 8.8%, with a false positive rate of 0.1 and a false negative rate of 0.09. Residual tumor size on MRI correlated well with microscopic findings (r = 0.982, p < 0.001) and gross tumor size in excised breasts correlated moderately with microscopic findings (r = 0.640, p < 0.001). Conclusion. Serial, dynamic, enhanced MRI monitoring of chemotherapeutic response in patients with locally advanced breast cancer can be used to assess early response to chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy tumor size change. Although the residual tumor size on MRI correlated well with the microscopic findings, surgical determination of residual cancer load is still recommended to avoid underestimation.

0037385597	Randomized trial of surgical staging (extraperitoneal or laparoscopic) versus clinical staging in locally advanced cervical cancer	Objective. To define the role of pretreatment surgical staging for locally advanced cervical carcinoma. Methods. A two-step randomized trial was conducted to compare clinical staging (arm A) versus surgical staging (arm B) and to compare the laparoscopic (LAP) with the extraperitoneal (EXP) approach in previously untreated locally advanced cervical carcinoma. After the first randomization, those in arm B were randomly allocated to either LAP or EXP. An interim analysis was planned to evaluate the feasibility of LAP versus EXP, which led to the current report. Results. A total of 61 patients were eligible (arm A, 29; arm B, 32). The operation time, blood loss, and lymph node yield of LAP and EXP were not significantly different. Serious acute and late toxicity was not different between arm A and arm B, or LAP versus EXP. Para-aortic node metastasis was documented in 25% (95% confidence interval, 10% to 40%) of patients on arm B. An interim analysis was performed in January 2000. Patients on arm B had significantly worse progression-free survival than those on arm A. Hazard ratios of relapse/persistent or death were 3.13 (P = 0.005) and 1.76 (P = 0.150), respectively. Patient accrual was terminated according to the early stopping rules. With further follow-up till December 2001, the difference in progression-free survival remained significant (P = 0.003), and the difference in overall survival became significant (P = 0.024) as the data matured. Conclusion. The benefit of pretreatment surgical staging for cervical carcinoma remained unproven. The detrimental effects of surgical staging observed in this study must be considered in the design of clinical guidelines or future trials. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

0038675068	Management of port-site metastasis after laparoscopic surgery for ovarian cancer	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to define the clinical features and long-term prognosis of port-site metastasis after primary laparoscopic surgery for ovarian cancer. STUDY DESIGN: All the patients with epithelial ovarian cancer or borderline malignancy who had undergone primary laparoscopic surgery at our institution were reviewed. The clinicopathologic parameters, flow cytometric parameters, p53, p27, bax, HER-2/neu, and bcl-2 by immunostaining, presentation of port-site implants, management of the individual patient, and long-term outcome were analyzed. CANCERLINE and MEDLINE (1960-2002) were searched for related papers. RESULTS: Between 1993 and 2001, of the 31 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer or borderline malignancy who underwent primary laparoscopic surgery at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, 6 (19.4%) had port-site metastasis. The other 2 patients were referred after port-site metastasis. Tumors with port-site recurrences had higher S-fraction than those without (median: 18.2% vs 9.9%, P = .003; relative risk ratio: >15.5% vs ≤ 15.5% = 38.33; 95% Cl, 3.3-449.2). Those patients who have port-site metastasis develop during chemotherapy (n = 2) or after adequate chemotherapy had been given (n = 2) all died of cancer. Two patients have been currently alive without disease, the tumors of whom were p27-positive and p53-, HER-2/neu-, bcl-2-negative. CONCLUSION: Port-site metastasis after laparoscopic surgery, during chemotherapy or when adequate chemotherapy has been given, is usually associated with poor outcome. Further investigations are necessary to define the mechanisms and effective management to prevent and treat this serious complication.

0037986562	Lack of correlation between expression of human mammaglobin mRNA in peripheral blood and known prognostic factors for breast cancer patients	Human mammaglobin (hMAM) mRNA is considered to be a promising candidate for a sensitive molecular marker for breast cancer. In this study, we attempted to relate the presence of hMAM mRNA in the peripheral blood with certain established clinicopathological features of breast cancer in order to validate its clinical utility. A total of 139 subjects including 79 with localized cancer, 33 with metastatic disease, and a control group of 27 individuals were studied. hMAM mRNA expression was assessed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on cells from peripheral blood. The expression of hMAM mRNA was found in 0 of the 27 control subjects, 1 of the 8 stage 0 (12.5%) patients, 4 of the 16 stage I (25%) patients, 13 of the 40 stage II (32.5%) patients, 5 of the 15 stage III (33.3%) patients, and 18 of the 33 (54%) cases of metastatic disease. There was a statistically significant (P=0.045) difference in frequency between patients with localized disease (29%) and those with metastatic disease. Although trends of increasing frequency of hMAM mRNA expression existed in patients with unfavorable prognostic factors, including primary tumor size, T stage, N stage, overall stage, presence of angiolymphatic permeation, negative estrogen receptor, high S-phase fraction (>7%), and aneuploid DNA index, none of the differences was significant. In conclusion, the clinical utility of hMAM mRNA may not be in screening or staging of breast cancer, but in following patients after surgery to detect recurrence. Further evaluation of hMAM mRNA in combination with other molecular markers to follow post-operative breast cancer patient is warranted.

0038048398	Enhancing mechanical strength during early fracture healing via shockwave treatment: An animal study	Objective. This investigation aims to determine (1) whether shockwave treatment helps fracture healing and (2) whether the effect of shockwave treatment on fracture healing is dose dependent. Design. Shockwave was applied over tibial osteotomy in an animal model to assess its effect on the healing of the fracture. Methodology. Bilateral tibial diaphyseal transverse osteotomy was conducted on 42 rabbits, dividing into experimental and control group, immobilized using an external skeletal fixator, with one leg tested with shockwave therapy and the contralateral leg acting as the control without therapy. Serial radiography and measurement of bone mineral density via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were performed to assess the fracture healing. The experimental animals had two or three sessions of shockwave therapy (5000 impulses, 0.32 mJ/mm

84870441216	Phosphorylated mTOR expression correlates with poor outcome in early-stage triple negative breast carcinomas	The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays an important role in cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. Some studies have associated phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR) expression with worse outcome in breast cancers. However, the significance of p-mTOR expression specifically in triple negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) is unknown. In this study, p-mTOR expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 172 TNBCs and the result was correlated with clinicopathologic variables and disease outcome. The majority of tumors (72.1%) were p-mTOR positive; p-mTOR expression did not correlate with age, tumor size, grade, lymph node status, or tumor stage. In patients at stage 1 and 2 disease, those with p-mTOR expression had significantly worse overall as well as recurrence-free survival compared to those without p-mTOR expression. p-mTOR expression appears to be an adverse prognostic indicator in early-stage TNBCs. The assessment of p-mTOR expression in these tumors may also help to stratify patients for future target therapy studies.

84872121127	Prognostic significance of pituitary tumour-transforming gene-binding factor (PBF) expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma	Background Pituitary tumour-transforming gene (PTTG)-binding factor (PBF), originally known as PTTG1 interacting protein (PTTG1IP), has been found to be significantly increased in well-differentiated thyroid cancer and independently associated with early tumour recurrence. Objective To assess the prognostic significance of PBF expression in a large cohort of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients with a long-term follow-up. Design and patients Retrospective analysis of PBF expression in PTC cases at different stages and correlate it with various clinicopathological parameters and patient survival. Subjects included 153 patients who received a thyroid operation for PTC at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 1991 and 2000. All patients had a complete follow-up till the end of 2010. Measurements Immunohistochemical study for PBF expression on tissue sections from tumour specimens. Bond automated machine (Leica Microsystems, Germany) with a polyclonal rabbit anti-PBF antibody (LifeSpan BioSciences, LS-C118942, Seattle, WA, USA) was used. SPSS 13.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. Results High PBF expression was significantly correlated with age (P = 0·0298), distant metastases at diagnosis (P = 0·0139), tumour multicentricity (P = 0·0035), TNM stage (P = 0·0103), locoregional recurrence (P = 0·0410) and disease-specific mortality (P = 0·0064). The expression level of PBF was significantly correlated with disease-specific survival (P = 0·0065). Cox regression analysis showed that age, tumour size and PBF expression were independent prognostic indicators (P = 0·0097, P = 0·0021 and P = 0·0179). Conclusion PBF expression may be a promising biomarker for prognostic and therapeutic purpose. More large-scale studies are needed to clarify its potential usefulness. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84872676117	Clinical implications of human papillomavirus genotype in cervical adeno-adenosquamous carcinoma	Background: Our aims were to evaluate the genotype distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) and the correlation between HPV parameters and clinicopathological/treatment variables with prognosis in cervical adeno-adenosquamous carcinoma (AD/ASC). Patients and methods: Consecutive patients who received primary treatment for cervical AD/ASC International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages I-IV between 1993 and 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Prognostic models were constructed and followed by internal validation with bootstrap resampling. Results: A total of 456 AD/ASC patients were eligible for HPV genotyping, while 452 were eligible for survival analysis. HPV18 was detected in 51.5% and HPV16 in 36.2% of the samples. Age >50 years old, FIGO stages III-IV and HPV16-negativity were significantly related to cancer relapse, and age >50, FIGO stages III-IV, HPV16-negativity and HPV58-positivity were significant predictors for cancer-specific survival (CSS) by multivariate analyses. HPV16-positivity was also significantly associated with good prognosis in those receiving primary radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation (RT/CCRT) (CSS: hazard ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval 0.21-0.78). Patients with FIGO stages I-II and HPV16-negative AD/ASC treated with primary RH-PLND had significantly better CSS (p < 0.0001) than those treated with RT/CCRT. Conclusions: Age >50 years old, FIGO stages III-IV and HPV16-negativity were significant poor prognostic factors in cervical AD/ASC. Patients with HPV16-negative tumour might better be treated with primary surgery (e.g. radical hysterectomy for stages I-II and pelvic exenteration for stage IVA). Those with unresectable HPV16-negative tumour (stage IIIB) should undergo CCRT in combination with novel drugs. The inferences of a single-institutional retrospective study require prospective studies to confirm. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84873996475	Estrogen stimulates the proliferation of human endometrial cancer cells by stabilizing nucleophosmin/B23 (NPM/B23)	Unopposed estrogen exposure is an important factor in the tumorigenesis of endometrial cancer. Nucleophosmin/B23 (NPM/B23), a phosphoprotein that has pleiotropic functions in cells, plays an important role in various cancers. However, the regulatory role of NPM/B23 in estrogen signaling in endometrial cancer has not been explored. Here, we report that NPM/B23 was required for estrogen-induced endometrial proliferation, and the increase in NPM/B23 was estrogen receptor α-dependent. Furthermore, estrogen increased NPM/B23 protein levels by repressing its ubiquitination and subsequently stabilizing the protein. The overexpression of the alternate reading frame (ARF) suppressed the estrogen-induced increase in the NPM/B23 protein levels, indicating that ARF inhibited the observed estrogen-mediated NPM/B23 stabilization. Our results suggest that one of the effects of estrogen on endometrial proliferation is the suppression of the NPM/B23-ARF interaction and the subsequent increase in NPM/B23 protein levels. This novel characterization of NPM/B23 in estrogen-mediated cell proliferation may extend our understanding of the tumorigenesis of steroid hormone-related cancers. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84874514818	Tumor Stress-Induced Phosphoprotein1 (STIP1) as a Prognostic Biomarker in Ovarian Cancer	Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) has been recently identified as a released biomarker in human ovarian cancer. In addition, STIP1 secreted by human ovarian cancer cells has been shown to promote tumor cell proliferation by binding to ALK2 (activin A receptor, type II-like kinase 2) and activating the SMAD-ID3 signaling pathways. In this study, a total of 330 ovarian cancer tumor samples were evaluated for STIP1 expression by immunohistochemistry and analyzed for a possible correlation with patient characteristics and survival. The quantification of immunoreactivity was accomplished by applying an immunohistochemical scoring system (histoscore). Patients with high-level STIP1 expression (histoscore ≥169) had a significantly worse survival (high STIP1, mean survival time = 76 months; low STIP1, mean survival time = 112 months; P<0.0001). Moreover, STIP1 histoscores were significantly higher in high-grade tumors (grade 3) than in low-grade (grade 1-2) malignancies (P<0.0001), suggesting that STIP1 may be a proxy for tumor aggressiveness. The results of multivariable analysis revealed that high STIP1 histoscores, advanced stages, histologic types, and the presence of residual disease (≥2 cm) were independent predictors of poor prognosis. The addition of STIP1 histoscores improved the prediction of overall and progression-free survival rates in the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. The treatment of ovarian cancer cells with recombinant STIP1 stimulated cell proliferation and migration, but co-treatment with anti-STIP1 antibodies abrogated this effect. Our findings suggest that STIP1 expression may be related to prognosis and that the STIP1 pathway may represent a novel therapeutic target for human ovarian cancer. © 2013 Chao et al.

84877584151	Potential of an age-stratified CA125 cut-off value to improve the prognostic classification of patients with endometrial cancer	Objective It is not clear whether the prognostic value of pretreatment serum CA125 levels is independent or through association with other clinicopathological features in endometrial cancer. Methods All patients with endometrial cancer treated between 2000 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. The correlation of clinicopathological characteristics, CA125 and treatment outcomes was analyzed. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were used to determine the CA125 cut-off values. Cox proportional hazard regression was used for multivariate analysis. Results Of the 923 eligible patients, 757 had serum CA125 levels measured before treatment. We identified 264 (34.9%) patients with pretreatment serum CA125 > 35 U/mL. By multivariate analysis, advanced stage (P = 0.001), serous or clear cell carcinoma (P = 0.008), positive peritoneal cytology (P = 0.042), and lymph node metastases (P = 0.004) were significant risk factors for cancer-specific survival (CSS), while serum CA125 > 35 U/mL (P = 0.067) was of borderline statistical significance. Using ROC curve stratified by age, we found that a serum CA125 > 35 U/mL was significant for CSS (HR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.04-5.29) among patients > 49 years old. After adjustment for confounding factors, serum CA125 > 105 U/mL was significant (HR = 6.03, 95% CI = 1.19-30.63) in patients ≤ 49 years old. Conclusions These results suggest that an age-stratified cut-off level for CA125 (35 U/mL in patients > 49 years old and 105 U/mL in patients ≤ 49 years old) can improve the prognostic stratification of patients with endometrial cancer. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84883449151	Clinicopathologic parameters and immunohistochemical study of endometrial stromal sarcomas	We aimed to investigate the clinicopathologic features, immunohistochemical studies, and prognosis in patients with endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS). Clinical information was reviewed retrospectively for cases of ESS (1985-2009). A histologic review and immunohistochemical staining for the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, c-Kit, CD-10, Ki-67, and m-TOR were performed. Sixty-one patients (median age, 44 y; range, 22-71) were eligible for analysis (1988 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stage I, 43; Stage II, 2; Stage III, 11; Sage IV, 4; unstaged, 1). The median follow-up period for survivors was 73 mo. Of those, the patients who underwent an adnexectomy and a pelvic lymphadenectomy, 15% and 13%, respectively, revealed metastasis. There were 20 relapses/persistence, including 13 (65%) in the pelvis and abdomen and 7 (35%) in distant sites. Eight patients died from ESS at a median duration of 14.5 mo (range, 2-50 mo) after relapse. Five- and 10-yr cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates were 88% and 85%, respectively; and 5- and 10-yr progression-free survival rates were 69% and 57%, respectively. Stage, residual disease, and high proliferative index of Ki-67 were significant prognostic factors for both progression-free survival and CSS in a univariate analysis, in addition to mitotic index for CSS. Multivariate analysis selected only residual disease as an independent variable for progression-free survival and stage and residual disease for CSS. Our results support using clinical Stage I, no residual disease, low proliferative index of Ki-67, and estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor overexpression as potential biomarkers to select patients with ESS for fertility-preservation surgery (5 such patients were alive and free). © 2013 International Society of Gynecological Pathologists.

84883645377	Estradiol and Tamoxifen Induce Cell Migration through GPR30 and Activation of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) in Endometrial Cancers with Low or without Nuclear Estrogen Receptor α (ERα)	Estrogens and tamoxifen (an antiestrogen) exert their actions by activation of estrogen receptor (ER) through genomic and non-genomic mechanisms and are implicated in the development of endometrial cancer. Previous reports have demonstrated that estradiol and tamoxifen induce proliferation of human endometrial cancer cells through GPR30 (non-genomic ER) signaling pathway. Herein, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is involved in cell migration induced by estradiol, tamoxifen and G1 (a GPR30 agonist) through the transmembrane ER (GPR30) in endometrial cancer cell lines with or without ERα (Ishikawa and RL95-2). Additionally, the GPR30-mediated cell migration was further abolished by administration of either specific RNA interference targeting GPR30 or an FAK inhibitor. Moreover, we have validated that the signaling between GPR30 and phosphorylated FAK is indeed mediated by the EGFR/PI3K/ERK pathway. Clinically, a significant correlation between levels of GPR30 and phophorylated FAK (pFAK) observed in human endometrial cancer tissues with low or without ERα further suggested that estrogen-induced phosphorylation of FAK and cell migration were most likely triggered by GPR30 activation. These results provided new insights for understanding the pathophysiological functions of GPR30 in human endometrial cancers. © 2013 Tsai et al.

0142008435	Value of dual-phase 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography in cervical cancer	Purpose: The role of positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18-labeled fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in cervical cancer has not yet been well defined. We conducted a prospective study to investigate its efficacy in comparison with magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography (MRI-CT). Materials and Methods: Patients with untreated locally advanced (35%) or recurrent (65%) cervical cancer were enrolled onto this study. In the first part of this study, 41 patients had a conventional FDG-PET (40 minutes after injection), and in the second part, 94 patients received dual-phase PET (at both 40 minutes and 3 hours after injection). The overall results of PET scans were compared with MRI-CT, and the two protocols of PET were also compared with each other. Lesion status was determined by pathology results or clinical follow-up. The receiver operating characteristic curve method with area under the curve (AUC) calculation was used to evaluate the discriminative power. Results: Overall (N = 135), FDG-PET was significantly superior to MRI-CT in identifying metastatic lesions (AUC, 0.971 v 0.879; P = .039), although the diagnostic accuracy was similar for local tumors. Dual-phase PET was also significantly better than the 40-minute PET (n = 94). The latter accurately recognized 70% of metastatic lesions and the former detected 90% (AUC, 0.943 v 0.951; P = .007). Dual-phase FDG-PET changed treatment of 29 patients (31%; upstaging 27% and downstaging 4%). Conclusion: This study shows that dual-phase FDG-PET is superior to conventional FDG-PET or MRI-CT in the evaluation of metastatic lesions in locally advanced or recurrent cervical cancer. © 2003 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

0142027520	Sclerosing stromal tumor of ovary	Sclerosing stromal tumor of the ovary is a rare ovarian disease with prevalence of 1.5% to 6% of ovarian stromal tumors. We present a 24-year-old woman with irregular menstruation for 6 months and a self-palpable lower abdominal mass. Enucleation of the left ovarian tumor was undertaken. Gross examination showed a soft elastic tumor with a smooth outer surface and diffusely white edematous stroma with scattered yellowish nodular areas on the cut surface. Histologic study showed that the cellular nodules consisted of a disorganized admixture of fibroblasts and round vacuolated tumor cells. The cellular nodules were separated by edematous hypocellular fibrous tissue forming a pseudolobular appearance. Regular menstruation resumed after the surgery and no evidence of tumor relapse during 1 year of follow up.

0142214846	Macrocystic Serous Cystadenoma of the Pancreas in a Young Patient Resembling a Pseudocyst: Case Report and Literature Review	Macrocystic serous cystadenoma is an unusual and essentially benign pancreatic tumor. Ages of reported cases are usually 60 years and over, with a mean age of 54 years. Herein, we report on a 26-year-old man who presented with upper abdominal pain. A cystic lesion in the mid-portion of the pancreas was revealed by abdominal computed tomography, and a pseudocyst was suspected. A distal pancreatectomy was performed with a splenectomy due to intractable abdominal pain and being unable to rule out to be a mucinous cystic neoplasm, which has a malignant potential. The histopathological diagnosis was macrocystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. To our knowledge, this patient is the youngest person to present with such tumor. Clinical and pathologic features including complete immunohistochemical studies are presented, and we review the relevant literature.

84892456198	Reappraisal of TLE-1 immunohistochemical staining and molecular detection of SS18-SSX fusion transcripts for synovial sarcoma	The aim of the present study was to re-evaluate TLE-1 staining and the molecular detection methods of SS18-SSX transcripts for synovial sarcoma. We analyzed TLE-1 expression in 50 molecularly confirmed synovial sarcomas and 85 other soft tissue tumors with three previously published scoring systems. In the present study, 39 to 43 synovial sarcomas showed TLE-1 nuclear staining, whereas 9-15 of 85 other soft tissue tumors showed TLE-1 staining (P<0.0001). The specificities of strong TLE-1 staining were 100%, 97.6% and 98.8%. The positive likelihood ratio of moderate and strong TLE-1 nuclear expression was >10 in all three scoring systems. There was no difference in TLE-1 staining between different subtypes of synovial sarcoma (P>0.05). Based on a comparison between conventional reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), quantitative RT-PCR is a more sensitive method than conventional RT-PCR and FISH to detect t(X;18). A positive correlation between TLE-1 staining and SS18-SSX translocation was detected by conventional PCR (P<0.05). In conclusion, although all three scoring systems could differentiate synovial sarcoma from other soft tissue tumors, diffuse moderate to severe intensity tumors showed the highest specificity in the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma. © 2013 Japanese Society of Pathology and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84899682295	Identification of patients with node-negative, triple-negative breast cancer who benefit from adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy	Aim: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a relatively poor prognosis compared to other molecular subtypes of breast cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the role of adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) in node-negative TNBC and to identify patients who could benefit from this therapy. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathological features and outcomes of patients with node-negative TNBC after surgery followed by either adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF or observation only. Results: Between January 2000 and December 2006, 276 patients with node-negative TNBC were eligible for inclusion in this study. The median follow-up time was 85.0 months by the end of 2010. The CMF (N=211) and observation (N=65) groups did not significantly differ with regard to T-stage, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and tumour grade, but patients in the former group were on average younger (p<0.01). Adjuvant CMF was associated with favourable disease-free survival (DFS) (p=0.04). The CMF group also had a significantly lower locoregional recurrence rate than the observation group (0.4% vs. 9.2%, p=0.02). Subgroup analysis revealed that patients in the CMF group had significantly better DFS than those in the observation group among those with tumours larger than 2 cm (hazard ratio=0.38, p=0.02) and those who underwent partial mastectomy (hazard ratio=0.28, p=0.01). Conclusion: Adjuvant CMF chemotherapy was effective in reducing locoregional recurrence rate and prolong DFS in patients with node-negative TNBC, particularly in those with tumours of more than 2 cm or who had undergone partial mastectomy.

84900405786	Fertility-preserving treatment in young women with endometrial adenocarcinoma: A long-term cohort study	Objective: Growing evidence suggests that fertility-preserving treatment is feasible for young women with early-stage, low-grade endometrial carcinoma. However, published data on their long-term outcomes and prognostic factors remain scanty. We aimed to investigate the outcomes of young women receiving fertility-preserving treatment. Methods: Between 1991 and 2010, the outcomes of young women with grade 1 endometrioid endometrial carcinoma at presumed stage IA (without myometrial invasion) who underwent fertility-preserving treatment of megestrol acetate 160 mg/d with or without other hormonal agents were retrospectively analyzed. Results: We identified 37 eligible patients (median age, 32 years; range, 18-40 years). The median follow-up time was 78.6 months (range, 19.1-252.8 months). Complete response (CR) lasting more than 6 months was achieved in 30 (81.1%) women. Responders were significantly younger than nonresponders (P = 0.032). Of the 30 women who had a CR, 15 (50.0%) had disease recurrence. The 5-, 10-, and 15-year cumulative recurrence-free survival rates were 51.0%, 51.0%, and 34.0%, respectively. Notably, those recurred were significantly older (P = 0.003), and the time to CR was significantly longer (P = 0.043) than those without recurrence. One patient developed late recurrences at 156 months, and 2 patients developed ovarian metastasis (6 and 137 months from diagnosis). All the patients are currently alive. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of high-dose megestrol acetate-based therapy for fertility preservation. The substantial risk of late recurrences highlights the need for long-term follow-up studies of large sample sizes with in-depth tumor and host molecular signatures.

84906327367	A dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib suppresses overexpression of matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1) in endometrial cancer	Endometrial cancers have been recently molecularly characterized; amplifications of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were seen in 25 % of the serous-like tumors, and mutations in the PI(3)K/AKT pathways were seen in 93 % of endometrioid tumors. These new findings about endometrial cancer suggest a potential for targeted therapy with lapatinib, a dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2 tyrosine kinases. However, the clinical efficacy of lapatinib in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of endometrial cancers was only minimal. In this study, we investigated the signaling changes induced by lapatinib in endometrial cancer, which may improve its therapeutic efficacy in molecularly selected patient groups. We identified one of the final molecular targets of lapatinib to be interstitial collagenase, matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1). Lapatinib suppresses MMP1 through EGFR and HER2, and their downstream ERK and AKT signaling pathways. We also found that the activating protein-1 binding site of MMP1 promoter is required for its transcriptional activation, which may be unique for endometrial cancers. Our results also showed that forced expression of active ERK or active AKT mutants rescued MMP1 expression from lapatinib suppression, further suggesting the importance of molecular selection to find appropriate patients with endometrial cancer for future clinical trials with any targeted therapies. Key message: • MMP1 expression was high in tissues and sera in patients with endometrial cancer. • Lapatinib inhibited MMP1 via both HER2 and EGFR signaling pathways. • Both AKT and ERK need to be inhibited for efficient MMP1 suppression by lapatinib. • Activating protein-1 (AP-1) binding site of MMP1 promoter is uniquely required for MMP1 activation in endometrial cancer. • Suppression of both c-fos and c-Jun bound to AP1 binding site is required for lapatinib inhibition. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

0642276586	Intraoperative Ultrasonographically Guided Excisional Biopsy or Vacuum-Assisted Core Needle Biopsy for Nonpalpable Breast Lesions	Objective: To compare duration and rates of underestimation and complete excision for nonpalpable breast lesions using either intraoperative ultrasonographically guided excisioned biopsy (IUGE) or directional vacuum-assisted biopsy (DVAB). Summary Background Data: Percutaneous ultrasonography-guided core needle biopsy is preferable to stereotactic biopsy for treatment of nonpalpable breast lesions; however, underestimation and false-negative results can occur., and rebiopsy may be required. To date, however, there has been no comparison of these two procedures in terms of diagnostic accuracy and duration. Methods: For 4 consecutive years, IUGE was performed for 104 nonpalpable breast lesions and DVAB for 128 lesions at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Of the DVAB cases, the handheld mammotome was used for 53 procedures, with all lesions removed as completely as possible. The duration of the two procedures was calculated from initial skin incision until completion of wound closure. Most of the patients with benign pathology underwent ultrasonographic examination at 3 months after surgery, with a follow-up examination at 1 year. Surgery was performed subsequently for all of the malignancy cases. Results: The average ages and mean tumor sizes for patients undergoing IUGE or DVAB were 46 and 47 years and 1.1 and 1.0 cm, respectively. The average IUGE and DVAB surgery durations for 88 benign tumors and 117 benign lesions were 44.3 and 21.5 minutes, respectively (P < 0.001), and 43.5 and 20.6 minutes for the malignant tumors (n = 16 and n = 11), respectively (P = 0.036). The IUGE and DVAB surgery durations for tumors <1 cm in diameter were 43.5 and 20.6 minutes, respectively, and 44.2 and 23.6 minutes for tumors over that size (P < 0.001). An older-model mammotome was used for 75 patients, with an average duration of 24 minutes in comparison to 18 minutes for the handheld variant (P < 0.001). No false-negative results were noted and, except in the case of the malignant tumors, there was no need for reexcisional biopsy. Further, there were no underestimates of the disease for the 4 cases of atypical ductal hyperplasia and the 12 of noninvasive carcinoma. No further ultrasonographic evidence of tumors was noted for 95% of the benign pathologies, with no residual abnormality detected for 13 of the 27 malignant tumors after IUGE or DVAB. Conclusions: For treatment of nonpalpable breast lesions, both IUGE and DVAB eliminate false-negative results, underestimates, and the requirement for reexcisional biopsies. In comparison to IUGE, DVAB is more convenient and time efficient for excisional biopsy of nonpalpable breast lesions.

10744228207	Correlation of dynamic contrast enhancement MRI parameters with microvessel density and VEGF for assessment of angiogenesis in breast cancer	Purpose: To investigate the association between parameters obtained from dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) of breast cancer using different analysis approaches, as well as their correlation with angiogenesis biomarkers (vascular endothelial growth factor and vessel density). Materials and Methods: DCE-MRI results were obtained from 105 patients with breast cancer (108 lesions). Three analysis methods were applied: 1) whole tumor analysis, 2) regional hot-spot analysis, and 3) intratumor pixel-by-pixel analysis. Early enhancement intensities and fitted pharmacokinetic parameters were studied. Paraffin blocks of 71 surgically resected specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining to measure microvessel counts (with CD31) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression levels. Results: MRI parameters obtained from the three analysis methods showed significant correlations (P < 0.0001), but a substantial dispersion from the linear regression line was noted (r = 0.72-0.97). The entire region of interest (ROI) vs. pixel population analyses had a significantly higher association compared to the entire ROI vs. hot-spot analyses. Cancer specimens with high VEGF expression had a significantly higher CD31 microvessel densities than did specimens with low VEGF levels (P < 0.005). No significant association was found between MRI parameters obtained from the three analysis strategies and IHC based measurements of angiogenesis. Conclusion: A consistent analysis strategy was important in the DCE-MRI study. In this series, none of these strategies yielded results for MRI based quantitation of tumor vascularity that were associated with IHC based measurements. Therefore, different analyses could not account for the lack of association. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

0347364788	The impact of image fusion in resolving discrepant findings between FDG-PET and MRI/CT in patients with gynaecological cancers	This study was performed to prospectively investigate the impact of image fusion in resolving discrepant findings between fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or X-ray computed tomography (CT) in patients with gynaecological cancers. Discrepant findings were defined as lesions where the difference between the FDG-PET and MRI/CT images was assigned a value of at least 2 on a 5-point probability scale. The FDG-PET and MRI/CT images were taken within 1 month of each other. Image fusion between FDG-PET and CT was performed by automatic registration between the two images. During an 18-month period, 34 malignant lesions and seven benign lesions from 32 patients who had undergone either surgical excision or a CT-guided histopathological investigation were included for analysis. Among these cases, image fusion was most frequently required to determine the nature and/or the extent of abdominal and pelvic lesions (28/41, 68%), especially as regards peritoneal seeding (8/41, 20%). Image fusion was most useful in providing better localisation for biopsy (16/41, 39%) and in discriminating between lesions with pathological versus physiological FDG uptake (12/41, 29%). Image fusion changed the original diagnosis based on MRI/ CT alone in 9/41 lesions (22%), and the original diagnosis based on FDG-PET alone in 5/41 lesions (12%). It led to alteration of treatment planning (surgery or radiotherapy) in seven of the 32 patients (22%). In patients with gynaecological cancers, the technique of image fusion is helpful in discriminating the nature of FDG-avid lesions, in effectively localising lesions for CT-guided biopsy and in providing better surgical or radiotherapy planning.

11244348976	Overexpression of SPARC gene in human gastric carcinoma and its clinic-pathologic significance	Gastric cancer is the second most common cancer in the world and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in Taiwan. To improve the survival of gastric cancer patients, biomarkers for early: detection and effective anticancer therapy are required, An essential first step is to profile gene expression in gastric cancer and identify genes that are aberrantly expressed, and to do this cDNA microarrays were performed. The clinic-pathologic correlation and prognostic significance of the aberrantly expressed genes were evaluated to identify novel biomarkers of gastric cancer. Fresh surgical samples of tumour tissue and matching noncancerous mucosa were obtained immediately after gastric resection in 43 patients. Secreted Protein, Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC) (Osteonectins), one of the most highly expressed genes in both intestinal and diffuse gastric cancers in our microarray results, was selected for further study. The overexpression of SPARC was verified using real-time quantitative-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR), Northern blot and immunohistochemical staining. The expression of SPARC in tumour tissues was, on average, 4.27-fold increased (95% Cl 2.68-5.85) compared to adjacent noncancerous mucosa (P<0.001). The expression of SPARC was higher in advanced (T2, T3 and T4) cancer compared to the early (TI) cancer (P = 0.048) with regard to depth of wall invasion. Higher expression of SPARC was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P<0,001), lymphatic invasion (P = 0.004) and perineural invasion (P = 0.047). Expression of SPARC in patients in stage II and above was significantly higher than those in stage 1 (P = 0.017). The 3-year survival of patients with lower expression of SPARC was significantly better than those with a higher expression (log rank P = 0.047). These data indicate the potential of SPARC as a prognostic marker for gastric cancer. © 2004 Cancer Research UK.

1242292314	Analysis of sonographic features for the differentiation of benign and malignant breast tumors of different sizes	Objective: To analyze the value of various sonographic features in differentiating benign from malignant breast tumors of different sizes to improve the diagnostic accuracy in small lesions. Methods: The sonographic features of 1203 histologically confirmed solid breast lesions were prospectively documented with respect to anteroposterior (AP) diameter/width ratio, shape, margin, echogenicity, echotexture, posterior echo and bilateral refraction sign. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of breast ultrasound were calculated for lesions grouped according to size (≤ 1, 1.1-2 and > 2 cm). Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses including calculation of odds ratios for single sonographic features were used to analyze the significance of the different diagnostic features. Results: The accuracy of breast sonography in differentiating between benign and malignant tumors ≤ 1, 1.1-2 and > 2 cm in size was 75.6%, 86.4% and 88.4%, respectively. Univariate analysis demonstrated that all sonographic features were significant in tumors ≥ 1.1 cm. Shape, margin, echogenicity and echotexture were the significant factors in those tumors ≤ 1 cm. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that margin, shape, posterior echo and echogenicity were the significant factors for differential diagnosis in tumors > 2 cm. Echogenicity, margin, shape, bilateral refraction sign and echotexture were the significant factors for tumors 1.1-2 cm. On multiple regression analysis, margin was the only significant factor for tumors ≤ 1 cm. Conclusion: Tumor margin is the most important sonographic feature in evaluating breast lesions in any size group. With the combination of significant factors and emphasis on specific features according to size of lesion, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for the differential diagnosis of malignant and benign tumors may be improved.

13844280287	Outcome and prognostic factors in ovarian germ cell malignancies	Objectives. This study was undertaken to investigate the outcome and prognostic factors in patients with ovarian germ cell malignancies (OGCMs). Methods. A total of 93 patients with OGCMs were retrospectively reviewed, among whom 84 patients had primary treatment at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) between 1984 and 2003. The other nine patients were primarily treated outside and referred for follow-up (n = 1), adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 4), or salvage therapy after recurrence (n = 4). The clinicopathological and treatment-related characteristics were analyzed for association with the occurrence of tumor persistence/recurrence or death. Results. Of the study patients, 32 had dysgerminoma (DSG), 29 immature teratoma (IMT), 23 endodermal sinus tumor, 7 mixed germ cell tumors, and 1 each had choriocarcinoma and embryonal carcinoma. The median follow-up of survivors was 66 months (range, 12-236 months). The median time to recurrence or progression was 8 months. There were 11 treatment failures with 6 died of cancer. The 5-year survival rate was 97.4% for those primarily treated at CGMH. Histology (DSG/IMT versus non-DSG/IMT) (P < 0.0001) and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (P = 0.001) were significantly associated with treatment failure, while histology (P = 0.0004), salvage high-dose chemotherapy (HD-CT) after primary chemotherapy failed (P = 0.0405), and residual tumor after salvage surgery (P = 0.0014) were significant prognostic factors for overall survival. Conclusions. Prognosis of OGCMs is excellent if managed with standard treatment initially. Aggressive HD-CT with salvage surgery needs to be applied for recurrent/persistent disease after primary chemotherapy. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
