20744460043	Crystal structure of human vacuolar protein sorting protein 29 reveals a phosphodiesterase/nuclease-like fold and two protein-protein interaction sites	Vacuolar protein sorting protein 29 (Vps29p), which is involved in retrograde trafficking from prevacuolar endosomes to the trans-Golgi network, performs its biological functions by participating in the formation of a "retromer complex." In human cells, this complex comprises four conserved proteins: hVps35p, hVps29p, hVps26p, and sorting nexin 1 protein (SNX1). Here, we report the crystal structure of hVps29p at 2.1 Å resolution, the first three-dimensional structure of the retromer subunits. This novel structure adopts a four-layered α-β-β-α sandwich fold. hVps29p contains a metal-binding site that is very similar to the active sites of some proteins of the phosphodiesterase/nuclease protein family, indicating that hVps29p may carry out chemically similar functions. Structure and sequence conservation analysis suggests that hVps29p contains two protein-protein interaction sites. One site, which potentially serves as the interface between hVps29p and hVps35p, comprises 5 conserved hydrophobic and 8 hydrophilic residues. The other site is relatively more hydrophilic and may serve as a binding interface with hVps26p, SNX1, or other target proteins. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

UV-Vis spectra suggested that Hb in the film could keep its secondary structure. Consequently, a pair of stable, well-defined, and quasi-reversible cyclic voltammetric peaks could be observed with the formal potential at -206 mV (vs. saturated calomel electrode), characteristic of heme Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couple of the protein. The apparent heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant and other electrochemical parameters were presented.

33749827805	Expression, refolding and preliminary characterization of recombinant snake venom metalloproteinases: Implication for the hemorrhagic mechanism	Two cDNAs encoding hemorrhagic snake venom metalloproteinase acutolysin A and non-hemorrhagic metalloproteinase (BR) were cloned into the expression vector pET-22b, respectively, and the corresponding two recombinant proteins, A-22b and BR-22b, were produced in inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant proteins were then subjected to solubilization, purification and refolding in vitro. A-22b showed hemorrhagic activity but no detectable proteolytic activities toward fibrinogen and fibronectin. Natural acutolysin A had both hemorrhagic activity and proteolytic activity toward these substrates. BR-22b showed the proteolytic activities toward fibrinogen, but no hemorrhagic activity. In addition, two chimeric genes, C1 and C2, were constructed and cloned into pET-22b, and the corresponding recombinant proteins, C1-22b and C2-22b, were also expressed in inclusion bodies. C1-22b involved N-terminal 110 amino acids of BR and C-terminal 95 amino acids of acutolysin A, while C2-22b contained N-terminal 108 amino acids of acutolysin A and C-terminal 112 amino acids of BR. The biological activities of C2-22b and C1-22b were similar to those of A-22b and BR-22b, respectively. Our results suggested that N-terminal major subdomain of a snake venom metalloproteinase might play a key role in hemorrhagic activity and have an appreciable effect on the selectivity for protein substrates.

Moreover, it could facilitate the electron transfer rate between cyanocobalamin and the electrode. A pair of well-defined cyclic voltammetric peaks for the redox reactions between [Co(III)] and [Co(II)] of cyanocobalamin was observed. The formal potential was at about -790 mV versus a saturated calomel electrode, which was much lower than the previous reports.

34547372266	Detection of flavonoids and assay for their antioxidant activity based on enlargement of gold nanoparticles	We report our findings that natural flavonoids such as quercetin, daizeol and puerarin can act as reductants for the enlargement of gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs). Consequently, the UV-vis spectra of a solution containing Au-NPs will be gradually changed, and the molecules of the natural herbs can be detected by making use of changes in the UV-visible spectra. Furthermore, we have prepared a self-assembled monolayer modified electrode by modifying cysteamine on a gold substrate electrode, which is further modified by some Au-NP seeds. When the modified electrode is immersed in a solution containing flavonoids and tetrachloroauric acid as a gold source for the growth of the Au-NP seeds, with the increase of the concentration of flavonoids, the Au-NP seeds on the surface of the modified electrode can be enlarged to varying degrees. As a result, the peak currents in the corresponding cyclic voltammograms are inversely decreased, and simultaneously the peak separation is increased. Therefore, an electrochemical method to detect flavonoids is also proposed. Compared with the optical detection method, the electrochemical method has an extraordinarily lower detection limit and a significantly extended detection range. Moreover, the optical and electrochemical experimental results can be also used to assay and compare the relative antioxidant activities of the flavonoids.

34948823815	Corrosion experiment in the first liquid metal LiPb loop of China	The liquid metal LiPb blanket design is one of the most promising designs for future fusion power reactors and under wide research in the world. The first liquid metal LiPb loop in China named DRAGON-I was built in 2005 in order to do research on characteristics of liquid metal LiPb such as its corrosion to structural materials of the blankets and so on. The first corrosion experiment in flowing LiPb with a speed of 0.08 m/s at 480 °C for 500 h was done in October 2005 on CLAM (China low activation martensitic) steel and 316L stainless steel for comparison. The weights and compositions, etc. of the specimens before and after corrosion experiment were tested and analyzed, the microstructures of the specimens were also inspected by SEM. The results show that the corrosion of CLAM steel is relatively slight, while that for 316L is obvious and very serious. Further study on corrosion behavior of CLAM for longer time experiment in liquid LiPb at different temperatures and flow speeds will be carried out in the near future. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In order to get the proper method of temperature measurement and controlling for high temperature LiPb in loops, 316L pipe is chosen to be heated up, and a temperature controlling system is designed so as to test the K-type thermal couples with different working styles. It is found that the temperatures of naked-type of thermal couples are much closer to the set-up temperature than those of shell-type or insulation-type ones at the same cross-section of the pipe, and the fluctuation of those temperature curves are very small. So, naked-type thermal couples are chosen to be used in DRAGON-I loop, the first thermal convection liquid metal LiPb loop in China. And the temperature measurement and controlling system satisfy well the need of temperature measurement for LiPb loop.

38549085296	Epitope mapping and structural analysis of an anti-ErbB2 antibody A21: Molecular basis for tumor inhibitory mechanism	Anti-ErbB2 antibodies targeting distinct epitopes can have different biological functions on cancer cells. A21 prepared by surface epitope masking (SEM) method is a tumor-inhibitory anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody. Previously we engineered a single chain chimeric antibody chA21 with potential for therapy of ErbB2-overexpressing tumors. Here, we mapped the A21 epitope on ErbB2 extracellular domain (ECD) by screening a combinatorial phage display peptide library, serial subdomain deletion, and mutagenesis scanning. X-ray crystal structure of the A21 scFv fragment at 2.1 Å resolution was also determined. A molecular model of Ag-Ab complex was then constructed based on the crystal structures of the A21 scFv and ErbB2 ECD. Some of biological functions of the A21 mAb and its derivative antibodies including their tumor cell growth inhibition and effects on the expression, internalization, and phosphorylation of ErbB2 receptor were also investigated. The results showed that A21 recognized a conformational epitope comprising a large region mostly from ErbB2 extracellular subdomain I with several surface-exposed residues important for the binding affinity. These data provide unique functional properties of A21 that are quite different from two broadly used anti-ErbB2 mAbs, Herceptin and 2C4. It suggested that the A21 epitope may be another valuable target for designing new anti-ErbB2 therapeutics. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Previous function investigations have suggested that SVMPs are the key toxins involved in a variety of snake venom-induced pathogenesis including systemic injury, local damage, hemorrhage, edema, hypotension, hypovolemia, inflammation and necrosis. However, up to now, there is no report on ion channels blocking activity about SVMPs.

This new controller has a new structure composed of two sub-controllers, the inner disturbance compensator and the outer nominal controller. An attractive advantage of this structure is that the parameters of the two controllers can be designed separately. That is, there is little coupling between the two sub-controllers. The comparison between the structures of the proposed controller and that of the traditional internal model controller is given, and detailed theoretical analysis on controller performances, robustness and sensitivity are conducted. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the feasible and validity of this new controller designing algorithm in the real application. © 2012 IEEE.

Two kinds of scales are found in a butterfly wing and the structural colour mainly comes from the cover scale. Different structural models of cover scale that are related to ridge and concavity are constructed and their corresponding optical properties are investigated using the finite-difference time-domain method. It is concluded that the structural colour on the cover scale mainly comes from the sculpted multilayer structure and the ridge on the scale has few effects on the structural colour. When the curvature of the sculpted multilayer structure decreases, the dominant wavelength of colour will shift to a longer wavelength and move slower and slower. The two-dimensional planar multilayer model can be used to calculate the structural colour when the curvature exceeds a certain value. © 2013 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

44849133099	Research and development status of china liquid Li-Pb blanket materials	The liquid Li-Pb blankets have become the most promising conceptual blankets in the world. Materials selection and development are one of the key issues for liquid Li-Pb blankets. Currently, the reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steels are chosen as the candidate structural material and liquid Li-Pb as neutron multiplier and tritium breeder. And in some designs, the flow channel insert (FCI), which can bear high temperature and have low electric conductivity, is adopted as the functional material to enhance the coolant outlet temperature and reduce the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pressure drop. In order to meet the requirement of liquid blanket development, the China low activation martensitic (CLAM) steel and functional materials for liquid blanket are being developed in Institute of Plasma Physics (ASIPP), Chinese Academy of Sciences under wide collaboration with other institutes and universities in domestic and overseas. Meanwhile, liquid Li-Pb thermal and forced convection loops were designed, manufactured and corrosion experiments were carried out to study the flow characteristics and the compatibility of liquid Li-Pb with structural and functional materials. In addition, a fusion material data management system was built to be a useful tool to accelerate the research and development on fusion blanket design and material technology.

54149116084	Feature of fluid inclusions and the period of petroleum accumulation in Linnan Sag	In order to determine the period of hydrocarbon accumulation in Linnan Sag, study on fluid inclusions of different structural parts is done systematically in this paper. The history of hydrocarbon migration and accumulation in Linnan sag is discussed based on the data of fluid inclusions, homogenization temperature, burial history, thermal history and hydrocarbon generation analyses. There are mainly 3 types of fluid inclusions in sandstone reservoirs in Linnan Sag, i. e., aqueous inclusion, liquid hydrocarbon inclusion and gas hydrocarbon inclusion. The homogenization temperatures of the aqueous inclusions coexisting with organic inclusions are 105-125 °C. It is supposed that in different structural parts in Linnan Sag there are different periods of hydrocarbon accumulation. Hydrocarbon accumulation in the center of Linnan Sag occurred in two stages. They were late Oligocene Dongying Period and Miocene Guantao Period to Pliocene Minghuazhen Period. The latter is the main accumulation period. Hydrocarbon accumulation on the edge of Linnan Sag occurred in Miocene Guantao to Pliocene Minghuazhen Period.

The three PDZ domains act as protein-recognition modules that may mediate protein assembly and subunit localization. The crystal structure of the second PDZ domain of ZO-2 (ZO-2 PDZ2) was determined by molecular replacement at 1.75 Å resolution, revealing a dimer in the asymmetric unit. The dimer is stabilized by extensive symmetrical domain-swapping of the Β1 and Β2 strands.

67649210735	Structural basis of the autolysis of AaHIV suggests a novel target recognizing model for ADAM/reprolysin family proteins	AaHIV, a P-III-type snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP), consists of metalloproteinase/disintegrin/cysteine-rich (MDC) domains and is homologous to a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family proteins. Similar to brevilysin H6 and jararhagin, AaHIV can easily autolyse to release a stable protein named acucetin, which contains disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of AaHIV and investigated the autolysis mechanism. Based on the structure of AaHIV and the results from docking experiments, we present a new model for target recognition in which two protein molecules form a functional unit, and the DC domain of one molecule is used for target recognition while the M-domain of the other is used for target proteolysis. Our results shed new light on the mechanism of target recognition and processing in ADAM/reprolysin family proteins. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The results show that the fault sealing in this area shows a great difference in time and space, and plays different roles in hydrocarbon migration and accumulation. Xiakou fault controls oil migrating to the gentle slope. The poor fault sealing of east section can form hydrocarbon migration channel through connecting source rock and trap, while the fault sealing of west section is good, which can form reservoirs by preventing hydrocarbon from migrating. The third or fourth grade faults within gentle slope control hydrocarbon migration and accumulation layer. Further exploration targets should be focused on the fault-block traps in the Es4 formation in the northern of the study area.

In this method, a nominal controller is established and a disturbance observer is created using acceleration signals to compensate quickly and precisely the external disturbance and to reduce the effect of the model error. Thus, the dynamical function and disturbance rejection ability of the system are enhanced. The experiment result shows that this control method can improve the dynamic performance of the motor control system, which accelerates motor responds and restrains overshoots. For the step external disturbance, the system speed only shows a pulse fluctuation with a width of 0.1 s, and the amplitude is one half of that of PID controller. Besides, the control system is robust towards the uncertainty of the motor model. These results show that the method has magnificent effects and good applications and is very suitable for engineering.

77955086054	Crystal structure of the two N-terminal RRM domains of Pub1 and the poly(U)-binding properties of Pub1	Yeast poly(U)-binding protein (Pub1) is a major nuclear and cytoplasmic protein that contains three RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains (termed Pub1RRM1, Pub1RRM2 and Pub1RRM3). Pub1 has been implicated as a regulator of cellular mRNA decay. Nearly 10% of all yeast mRNA decay occurs in a Pub1-dependent manner. Pub1 binds to and stabilizes AU-rich element (ARE) and ARE-like sequence-containing transcripts by protecting them from degradation through the deadenylation-dependent pathway, and also binds to and stabilizes stabilizer element (STE)-containing transcripts by preventing their degradation via the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. RNA-binding analyses showed that Pub1 binds to poly(U) in vitro. Here we show the crystal structures of Pub1RRM2 and the first two tandem RRM domains (Pub1RRM12). Crystallography showed that the structure of Pub1RRM12 is a domain-swapped dimer. Size exclusion chromatography assay and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) showed that Pub1RRM12 is a monomer in solution. Kinetic analysis showed that all three individual RRM domains can bind to poly(U) with similar affinities and Pub1RRM12 binds to a long poly(U) segment with higher affinity. Mutagenesis analysis revealed that residues on the β-sheets of Pub1RRM1 and Pub1RRM2 are critical for poly(U) binding. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The result shows that the flow pathway is complicated and the flow patterns appear three types, they are stable, fingering and preferable ones. The relationship between threshold pressure gradient and sandstone porosity is complicated when oil flows in low permeability sandstone, but there is a good relationship between the gradient and the permeability, and also, there is a good relationship between crude oil flowing velocity and displacing pressure, when flowing in different permeability sandstones at same velocity, oil displacing pressure will decrease as the permeability increases.

Prp20p plays multiple roles in mRNA metabolism, nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitosis regulation. Prp20p also functions as a linker between chromatin and nuclear pore complex (NPC) which regulates the NPC-mediated boundary activity (BA). Prp20p contains an N-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a typical RCC1-like domain (RLD). Here we present the 1.9.

0035677334	A draft sequence of the rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica) genome	The sequence of the rice genome holds fundamental information for its biology, including physiology, genetics, development, and evolution, as well as information on many beneficial phenotypes of economic significance. Using a "whole genome shotgun" approach, we have produced a draft rice genome sequence of Oryza sativa ssp. indica, the major crop rice subspecies in China and many other regions of Asia. The draft genome sequence is constructed from over4.3 million successful sequencing traces with an accumulative total length of 2214.9 Mb. The initial assembly of the non-redundant sequences reached 409.76 Mb in length, based on3.30 million successful sequencing traces with a total length of 1797.4 Mb from an indica variant cultivar 93-11, giving an estimated coverage of 95.29% of the rice genome with an average base accuracy of higher than 99%. The coverage of the draft sequence, the randomness of the sequence distribution, and the consistency of BIG-ASSEMBLER, a custom-designed software package used for the initial assembly, were verified rigorously by comparisons against finished BAC clone sequences from both indica and japanica strains, available from the public databases. Over all, 96.3% of full-length cDNAs, 96.4% of STS, STR, RFLP markers, 94.0% of ESTs and 94.9% unigene clusters were identified from the draft sequence. Our preliminary analysis on the data set shows that our rice draft sequence is consistent with the comman standard accepted by the genome sequencing community. The unconditional release of the draft to the public also undoubtedly provides a fundamental resource to the international scientific communities to facilitate genomic and genetic studies on rice biology.

It is difficult to measure the detailed dual-flow fields of liquid metal LiPb and helium gas in mini-TBM. Three dimensions numerical analysis of the LiPb and helium gas flow and heat transfer in Mini-Test Blanket Module (TBM) therefore has been carried out using the CFD code FLUENT.

80054021234	Corrosion behavior of CLAM steel in static and flowing LiPb at 480 °c and 550 °c	Reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steels are widely regarded as promising structural materials for fusion reactors. So the compatibility of RAFM steel with liquid metal should be investigated. Series corrosion experiments on CLAM steel in static and flowing LiPb with different flowing velocities have been performed both at 480 °C and 550 °C for thousands hours in DRAGON-ST and DRAGON-RT devices, respectively. The results of static experiments showed that the corrosion of CLAM steel was affected obviously by the crucible materials mainly due to the isothermal mass transfer between dissimilar metals during the corrosion process, and also the temperature and flowing velocity effect on the corrosion was also verified in the series experiments. The corrosion of CLAM steel tested in liquid LiPb can be attributed to the corrosion attack on the boundary of grain and the depletion of iron and chromium elements on the surface of CLAM steel after exposure. Further corrosion experiment under longer corrosion time will be carried out in the near future. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84865470765	R&D of DRAGON series lithium-lead loops for material and blanket technology testing	The liquid LiPb blanket concept has become a promising design for fusion reactor in the world, and a series of fusion reactors with LiPb blankets have been designed by FDS team in China. To support the various designs and technologies of Chinese LiPb breeder blankets, LiPb experimental loops have been built to follow the different phases of LiPb blankets requirements and to achieve different testing functions. Three thermal convection loops named DRAGON-I, II, and III were built to carry out the compatibility experiments and validate the loop technology, and the multifunctional forced convection loops named DRAGON-IV and V were built or designed to validate the magnetohydrodynamic effect and thermal-hydraulics test. Three sets of He-LiPb dualcoolant auxiliary systems named DRAGON-VI, VII, and VIII were designed and proposed for testing test blanket modules in EAST, ITER, and DEMO blankets in the future. An overview on the design and construction of these loops is introduced in this paper, as well as some preliminary experiments done in the loops.

0037023384	A draft sequence of the rice genome (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica)	We have produced a draft sequence of the rice genome for the most widely cultivated subspecies in China, Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica, by whole-genome shotgun sequencing. The genome was 466 megabases in size, with an estimated 46,022 to 55,615 genes. Functional coverage in the assembled sequences was 92.0%. About 42.2% of the genome was in exact 20-nucleotide oligomer repeats, and most of the transposons were in the intergenic regions between genes. Although 80.6% of predicted Arabidopsis thaliana genes had a homolog in rice, only 49.4% of predicted rice genes had a homolog in A. thaliana. The large proportion of rice genes with no recognizable homologs is due to a gradient in the GC content of rice coding sequences.

84874052472	Label-free real-time detection of DNA methylation based on quartz crystal microbalance measurement	DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene transcription, chromatin compaction, genome imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation. DNA methyltransferase is considered a potential target for anticancer drug design. It is important to locate aberrantly methylated sequences on the human genome that are linked to specific diseases and to discover new low-toxic methylation inhibitors for medical treatments. We developed a DNA methylation detection method using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). We applied this method to assay genes p16 and GALR2 in two cell lines. Methylation of p16 was detected in both HT29 and HepG2 cell lines, whereas methylation of GALR2 was detected only in the HT29 cell line. We also used this method to evaluate the effect of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (decitabine), a methyltransferase inhibitor used in clinical treatment. We found methylation of genes p16 and GALR2 to be strongly inhibited. The results show that this method is sensitive to DNA methylation and is fit for evaluation of methyltransferase inhibitors. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84875827462	Brilliant and tunable color by changing pore diameter of metal-coated porous anodic alumina	Porous anodic alumina (PAA), with highly ordered microstructures, has attracted much attention due to some unique physical and optical characteristics. In recent years, PAA is also used to obtain different colors by methods such as growing nanowires, tuning pore depth, or sputtering metal on PAA surface. In this paper, we report a simple and precisely controllable method to tune color by changing the pore diameter of PAA. In order to obtain PPA with different pore diameter, we first prepare the PPA membrane by two step anodization of high purity aluminium foil in acidic solutions and then immerse the fabricated PPA membrane into phosphoric acid to enlarge pore diameter. The different pore diameters of PAA are controlled by immersed time in phosphoric acid. After sputtering metal on surface of PAA, the brilliant color can be seen on the surface of PAA. Different colors of PAA film with metal-coated are obtained using this method and colorful patterns are successfully fabricated. The physical model of the PAA is constructed and the mechanism of tuning color is analyzed. It is concluded that the color can be tuned by changing pore diameter of the PAA membrane. This method will be of potential use in decoration, color displays and anti-counterfeiting technology. © 2012 SPIE.

84876484634	The analysis and synthesis of PID controller based on closed loop response characteristics	In this paper, a new PID parameter tuning method is proposed. First, extensive analysis of the PID frequency properties is conducted. Based on the analysis results, the concept of characteristic frequency of the PID controller is proposed, which builds a relationship between the PID parameters and the oscillation characteristics of the closed loop response of the PID control system. This relationship makes it possible to adjust the PID parameters according to the oscillation characteristics of the closed loop response of the PID control system. Based on the characteristic frequency of the PID controller and the corresponding analysis results, three tuning rules of the PID parameters are proposed, which are based on the characteristics of the closed loop response. The merits of these tuning rules are: only the characteristics of the closed loop response of the control system are required in the tuning process, while the system model of the controlled object is not required. The effectiveness of these tuning rules is verified by the simulation results for several models of the controlled objects. © 2012 IEEE.

84881346446	Evolution of titanium surfaces irradiated by femtosecond laser pulses with different wavelengths	This paper reports on the evolution of femtosecond laser induced periodic surface structures (LIPSSs) on titanium surface irradiated with different wavelengths. By SEM observations, it is noted that different nanostructures with respective surface features depend highly on the laser wavelength and the laser fluence. The period of LIPSSs formed at the laser fluence just above the ablation threshold is shorter than the laser wavelength, as well as dependence on the incident wavelength. Experiments using wavelength of 600 and 1500 nm, studies are performed in more detail. The period and the depth of the grooves of LIPSSs are increased with the increase of laser fluence at wavelength of 600nm. The created structures on the surface at the laser fluence of 0.42 J/cm

China Low Activation Martensitic (CLAM) steel has been chosen as the primary candidate structural material for PbLi blanket in China. The effect of strain rate on mechanical properties of CLAM steel with and without liquid PbLi under Ar atmosphere has been investigated with slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) test at 480 C. SEM observation showed the specimens tested in both environments exhibited ductility fracture with dimpled behavior. The primary tensile results tested with and without PbLi indicated that the uniform elongation of CLAM specimens was independent of strain rate, whereas the total elongation decreased with increasing strain rate. The strength properties tested with liquid PbLi under Ar increased with strain rate from 8.33 × 10

We investigated the effect of femtosecond laser pulse overlap on the liquid flow characters in surface grooves both in experimental evidence and theoretical analysis. With the increase of the femtosecond laser pulse overlap, the speed of water flowing in grooves is increased. Both the surface granular protrusions microstructures and the surface chemical composition can influence the liquid dynamics in grooves.

Then a model free PID parameter tuning method is proposed according to the principle of least vibration and maximal open loop gain. This method only requires the information of vibration frequency of the closed loop response curves, thus the influence of model parameter identification error on the tuning result is avoided and the tuning process is simplified. Finally, experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

84924353839	An input shaping method based on system output	In this paper, an input shaping method is proposed. This method only requires the system output, and doesn't need the system model information. In the application of this method, the basic form of an input shaping filter is first decided, then according to the form of the filter, the system output is decomposed into several weighted signals. Based on the decomposition, the least square method is applied to minimize the difference between the actual system output and the reference system output. In this way, the vibration in the system output is eliminated and the desired bandwidth of the whole system can be fulfilled.
