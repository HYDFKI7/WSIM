18644381670	Boundary integral equation method for conductive cracks in two and three-dimensional transversely isotropic piezoelectric media	Using the fundamental solutions and the Somigliana identity of piezoelectric medium, the boundary integral equations are obtained for a conductive planar crack of arbitrary shape in three-dimensional transversely isotropic piezoelectric medium. The singular behaviors near the crack edge are studied by boundary integral equation approach, and the intensity factors are derived in terms of the displacement discontinuity and the electric displacement boundary value sum near the crack edge on crack faces. The boundary integral equations for two dimensional crack problems are deduced as a special case of infinite strip planar crack. Based on the analogy of the obtained boundary integral equations and those for cracks in conventional isotropic elastic material and for contact problem of half-space under the action of a rigid punch, an analysis method is proposed. As an example, the solution to conductive Griffith crack is derived. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33745179843	Numerical simulation on the turbulent flow and heat transfer in the shell side of the rod baffle heat exchanger	The shell side of the rod baffle heat exchanger is so complicated that the flow field and enhanced heat transfer mechanism of the shell side cannot be commentated by the theoretical method. A numerical method was applied to analyze the influence of the rod baffle on the flow of the shell side, and to present the status of turbulent flow and heat transfer in shell side of the shell-and-tube heat exchanger with rod baffle. A unit duct model of the longitudinal flow type heat exchanger was developed and the corresponding mathematical model was set up based on some suitable simplifications. The SIMPLE algorithm was employed to solve the coupling relation of pressure and velocity, and the wall-function method was used to analyze the solid boundaries in the unit duct. The standard k-ε two-equation model was used to simulate the flow field and temperature field in shell side of the heat exchanger at different fluid flux. The simulation results show that the rod baffles placed vertically and horizontally in the unit duct continuously shear and comminute the streamlines of the flow when the fluid crosses over the rod-baffles, change the fluid flow directions, and result in the disruption of the continuity and stability of the fluid. The disturbing flow can promote the fluid turbulent intensity and effectively enhance the heat transfer. The numerical analyses can provide the basic ideas for optimizing the rod baffle heat exchanger and improving its performance.

The factors of heat transfer are analyzed and the field synergy principle is extended. The forces related to the liquid in heat exchanger tubes with twisted-tape insert are analyzed and the influence on the flow field is indicated. With the consideration of the viewpoint of heat conveyance, the methods of reducing the floating resistance and increasing the efficiency of integrated heat transfer are presented. The distributing rules of liquid floating in the tube and heat transfer are obtained by numerical simulation which shows that the slick tube has the highest integrated heat transfer coefficient when the twisted-tape insert is about 500-600 mm. The analyses indicate that the length of the twisted-tape insert has wider adjusting area to adapt to the actual work condition to obtained a higher heat transfer coefficient or to lower the floating resistance, and that a higher level of integrated heat transfer coefficient is still kept. The above analyses indicate that the viewpoint of heat conveyance could guide the design of new enhanced heat transfer structures.

43749122744	Experimental investigation and development of the petal orifice-baffle longitudinal flow type heat exchangers	Improving the baffle structure of the tube bundle of heat exchanger is one of the key measures to increase the heat transfer efficiency of the longitudinal flow type heat exchanger (LFTHE) operating at lower Reynolds number. Based on the analysis of the structure and performance of rod baffle and orifice-baffle separately, the shortcomings of these two kinds' baffles were found. For the rod baffle, the shortcomings are having too large shell side flow area and with scarcity of disturbing function for the shell side flow of the LFTHE, and the shortcomings of orifice-baffle are its structure complexity and machining difficulty. In order to solve these shortcomings, a new type of simple petal orifice-baffle was proposed, and the testing systems for two LFTHEs with rod baffles and proposed petal orifice-baffles separately were set up. The results show that the total heat transfer coefficients of these two LFTHEs increase with the increase of Re of the shell side flow, and within the range of shell side Re of 1900-7500, the total heat transfer coefficients of the LFTHE with proposed petal orifice-baffles is 40% higher than that of the LFTHE with rod baffles, while its shell side pressure drop is slightly higher than that of LFTHE with rod baffles. It is obvious that the proposed petal orifice-baffle has more favorable performance of heat transfer and acceptable pressure drop, and the construction of the petal orifice-baffle proposed is simpler and more convenient to manufacture. Moreover, the stagger collocation of the two adjacent petal orifice-baffles can restrict the tubes along all directions, and thus the petal orifice-baffle has the favorable capability of preventing tube bundle vibration.

The authors have conducted a numerical simulation of the fluid flow and heat transfer in a C-type chaotic structure by using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software Fluent, and compared the detailed information depicting the difference between the structure in question and ordinary straight structures in respect of fluid flow field distribution, temperature profile and heat transfer characteristics. Also analyzed were the intensified heat transfer performance and specific features of the C-type chaotic structure. The analytic results show that the latter enables the fluid to produce a chaotic convection at a relatively low speed. This fluid state will intensify the turbulence and perturbation of the fluid, enhance the mixing of flows in the main flow zone or at places near walls, intensify the heat transfer in flow passages, and impart a uniform temperature distribution on flow channel cross section. Moreover, the Nusselt and Poiseuille number (i.e. fRe value) for the heat transfer in a chaotic convection is no longer a constant like that of an ordinary laminar flow, but will increase with an increase of Reynolds number.

In addition strain energy density rate factor, λ, is proposed as a material parameter for measuring crack resistance capability under creep condition. The preliminary analysis with λ is also applied in FGC and the numerical results showed that λ can also characterize the coating load capacity.

Analytic results show that when the tubesheet/tube clearance is less than and equals to the maximum clearance of 0.35 mm stipulated by the national standard for Grade I tube bundles, the scope influenced by the leakage flow from the clearance is very small. The flow of the fluid between the baffle plates approximates to an ideal transverse flow, thus a good heat transfer effectiveness can result. When the clearance under discussion is greater than and equals to the maximum clearance of 0.5 mm stipulated by the national standard for Grade II tube bundles, the vortex intensity caused by the leakage flow will become bigger and the flow of fluid between the baffle plates approximates to a longitudinal flow. As a result, the overall heat transfer performance of the heat exchange tubes will deteriorate. There exists a section at the back of the baffle plates, which has the worst heat exchange performance. The distance between the section and the baffle plates will increase with an increase of the Reynolds number and clearance.

83755224824	Numerical research on heat transfer and flow resistance performance of specially-shaped rod baffle heat exchangers	In order to overcome the disadvantages of heat transfer performance in the shell side of the common circular cross section rod baffle heat exchanger with a low Reynolds number, a numerical simulation on fluid flow and heat transfer in the shell side with different types of rod baffles is carried out. The rod baffles include the circular cross section, trigonal cross section, and rhombic cross section. The influence of heat transfer enhancement and flow resistance reduction affected by baffles is summarized. It is indicated that the trigonal and rhombic cross section rod baffles present the better performance of heat transfer enhancement and flow resistance reduction. With the rhombic cross section rod baffles in the shell side, the higher heat transfer coefficient and overall property in the shell side are achieved when Re is lower, and the heat transfer coefficient in the shell side is 10% higher than that of a circular cross section rod baffle at the same Reynolds number. The trigonal and rhombic cross section rod baffles in the shell side give more optional structure forms for expanding the application scope of rod baffle heat exchangers. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84865371663	Contrast experimental research on heat transfer and flow resistance performance for three kinds of shell-and-tube heat exchangers	There are some disadvantages in segmental baffle heat exchanger for the transversal flow over tubes in its shell side, such as the high flow resistance, large heat transfer dead region, and so on. The fluid flows longitudinally in the shell side of rod baffle heat exchanger, but the heat transfer performance is not perfect when the Reynolds number in shell side is low.

84867923457	3D simulation on the unit duct in the shell side of the ROD baffle heat exchanger	The ROD baffle heat exchanger can slightly enhance the shell side heat transfer coefficient with the significant reduction of pressure loss due to the shell side fluid flowing longitudinally through tube bundle, which leads to the reduction of the manufacture and running cost and in some cases to the dimensions reduction of the heat exchangers. Because of the complexities of fluid dynamics equations and the structure of heat exchangers, few theoretical researches have been accomplished to specify the shell side characteristics of the ROD baffle heat exchanger. A unit duct model in the shell side of the longitudinal flow type heat exchanger has been developed based on suitable simplification. A numerical analysis on shell side of the ROD baffle heat exchanger has been carried out at constant wall temperature to obtain the characteristics of heat transfer and pressure drop. The numerical results show that the ROD baffles placed vertically and horizontally in the unit duct continue to shear and comminute the streamline flow when the fluid crosses over the ROD-baffles, and change the fluid flow directions, and then the continuity and stability of the fluid are destroyed. The effect of disturbing flow can promote fluid turbulent intensity and effectively enhance heat transfer. The numerical analyses can provide the theoretical bases for optimizing the structure of ROD baffle heat exchanger and improving its performance. © 2006 Shanghai University.

84883431590	Material degradation and creep damage of aging components at high temperature	An assessment of material property degradation is carried out in this paper for an aged material taken from turbine component subjected to high temperature. Microstructure and chemical composition analysis is conducted to evaluate the damage status of the material after 16-year term of service. Testing samples are taken from the different regions of a steam turbine rotor with different working conditions. Regular material properties tests at high temperature, creep strength tests and creep crack growth (CCG) tests are performed to investigate the material property degradation. Experimental results reveal that the damage micro mechanism is sensitive to temperature and stress state. High temperature tensile properties of the rotor steel materials are degraded due to the damage. The creep deformation rate and creep crack growth rate are higher in more degraded material than that in less degraded material. The relationships between the microstructure, internal damage evolution and the material properties are discussed for the aged rotor steel. This study will provide a further support for prediction of the residual life of the component with different degree of material degradation and creep damage. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.

84896053859	Research on the influence of louver fin tilt angle on heat transfer at relatively high reynolds number	A two-dimensional model of the louver fin was established in this paper, and the influence of louver fins under different tilt angles on fluid flow and heat transfer at relatively high Reynolds number was analyzed by ANSYS Fluent. Results showed that when the louver fin tilt angle was 33°, the Nusselt number reached the maximum and the louver fin had the best heat transfer performance. The pressure drop increased with the increase of the tilt angle at the same Reynolds number. At the same tilt angle, both the Nusselt number and the pressure drop increased with the increment of the Reynolds number. By measuring the amount of heat transfer in the same pump power, it could be obtained that the louver fin had the best comprehensive performance when the tilt angle was 19°.

84898808539	Atomistic simulation of fatigue crack growth in α-Fe under high temperature	The crack growth behaviors loaded in mode I under strain and stress control at different temperatures were presented in α-Fe by atomistic simulations using LAMMPS code. The interatomic bonds of atoms were characterized using the embedded atom method interatomic potential. The simulation models were built with initial edge crack subjecting to cyclic uniaxial constant strain rate and constant stress. A temperature range from 100 K to 1200 K was considered to probe the influence of the temperature on crack growth. The crack growth mechanism and the radial distrinution function (RDF) during crack growth were investigated. The results indicated that the crack propagation mechanisms were sensitive to temperature and the boundary conditions. By proposed image adjusting technology the dislocation slip bands can be more clearly displayed on screen. In order to include the effect of temperature on crack growth, a temperature factor defined as a function of temperature in exponential form was introduced to modify the theoretical expressions based on thermal activation theory. Its coefficent and index can be determined by the RDF peak value obtained from atomistic simulations. For cyclic loading the crack growth process was dependent on both temperature and cyclic loading period in terms of simulations. Copyright © (2013) by International Conference on Fracture.
