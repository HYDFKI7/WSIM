A China-made high power LD side-pumping module is employed, which possesses a max power of 600 W at 808 nm, and oscillating wavelengh of Nd:YAG is confined to 1319 nm single wavelength by means of coating highly selective film. For the aim of obtaining high power of red laser, a Z-shaped resonator is designed, and the cooling temperature of KTP is lowered to 7°C to compensate the thermal effect of KTP. The generation of 1.8 W of the CW red laser beam is obtained with 317 W pumping power.

33746261245	High power laser diode pumped Nd: YAG continuous wave dual-wavelength laser	Dual-wavelength laser is used in many fields, but there are few reports on the continuous wave (CW) lasing of dual-wavelength in a single laser crystal with high power output.

During our calculation, two kinds of lattice structures that are very promising for the materials of terahertz components are found and some interesting phenomena that were not reported in the former papers are also presented. Using the finite difference time domain method, we simulated the electromagnetic field distribution of THz waves in a PC splitter.

40049092284	Dual-wavelength diode-end-pumped Nd:YAG laser operating simultaneously at 1319 nm and 1338 nm	Based on the lasing threshold equation of a diode-end-pumped Nd:YAG laser, the threshold condition of simultaneous dual-wavelength lasing is determined and the relationship between the transmission ratios of the output mirror corresponding to the two wavelengths is calculated. A simultaneous dual-wavelength continuous wave (cw) or quasi-cw diode-end-pumped Nd:YAG laser operating at 1319 nm and 1338 nm has been demonstrated.

33344461386	Theoretical analysis of optimum parameters for complete forbidden bands of three-dimensional photonic crystals with typical lattice structures	Based on plane wave expansion method, the influence of factors such as lattice structure, dielectric constant ratio and filling ratio on three-dimensional photonic crystals with fcc, diamond and woodpile structures is studied. Of these structures, the fcc structure, owing to its high symmetry, is only fit for close-packed lattice prepared by inverted-opal method. The diamond structure easily generates good complete band gaps with high band gap ratio, and also the complete forbidden band that is needed can be obtained by adjusting some parameters in the experiment. The woodpile structure can produce big band gaps in a wider parameter range than the other two structures, which offers convenience for preparing three-dimensional photonic crystals in the laboratory. For all three kinds of three-dimensional photonic crystal structures, their band gap width and band gap ratio can be improved with the increase of dielectric constant ratio. In this paper, some interesting phenomena not noticed in the former papers are also presented.

The charged-hadron yield is obtained by counting the number of reconstructed hits, hit pairs, and fully reconstructed charged-particle tracks. The combination of the three methods gives a charged-particle multiplicity per unit of pseudorapidity dNch/ dη|η|<0.5 = 5.78 ± 0.01(stat)±0.23(syst) for non-single-diffractive events, higher than predicted by commonly used models.

Using this method, no optical element needs to be inserted into the cavity. The symmetry of the output beam can be improved effectively by changing cavity parameters. The validity of this method is demonstrated by a corner-pumped Nd:YAG/YAG composite slab Q-switched fundamental-mode laser. The asymmetry of the output beam can be corrected effectively by adjusting the short arm length of the linear cavity and a symmetric output beam is obtained.

A preliminary analysis indicates that 52%-55% of the total emissions are from the peak emission hours. Non-catalyzed vehicles are the main sources contributing 60%-95% of the emissions.

44649104501	Evaluating the impact of low sulfur fuels in vehicular pollutant emissions in China	The Sulfur-Emission spreadsheet was established to quantify the impact of low sulfur fuels in pollutant control that could be obtained by 2020 in China. Five feasible scenarios were created and analyzed. These scenarios reflect the opinions of different stakeholders. SI is a scenario in which the fuel standards completely catch up with the nationwide emission standards. In S2, the transition region is Shanghai and Guangzhou because these regions already have ability to serve low sulfur fuels. S3 omitted the 350ppm sulfur diesel to save capital investment of oil industry. In S4, new emission level vehicles use accordant low sulfur fuels to lower the pressure of local oil industry. S5 is different from the others after 2015 by adding the ultra-low sulfur fuels. Comparing the emission inventories, the scenario in which low sulfur fuel standards were matched with emission standards (SI) was recommended. The emissions under S2 and S4 did not differ much. This emission assessment provides important information for the cost-benefit research of low sulfur fuel processes. It should be of interest to oil authorities and local governments in charge of environmental and energy planning in China.

45949088248	Analysis of the impacts of fuel sulfur on vehicle emissions in China	This paper describes the effect of fuel sulfur levels on vehicle emissions. The project was undertaken to provide a basis for lowering sulfur levels in fuel in order to establish necessary vehicle emission standards. A matrix was developed to describe the relationship between fuel sulfur levels and vehicle emissions based on vehicle testing data in China and the literature research. The matrix was then integrated into a vehicle behavior forecasting spreadsheet to analyze the vehicle emission reduction potentials under several fuel desulfurization scenarios. The results of comparing the total emissions in typical years for several scenarios show that the best emission control effect can be achieved by completely matching the fuel sulfur requirements with the emission standards. This assessment of vehicle emission standards and refinery costs to produce low sulfur fuel provides a critical insight into the importance of reducing fuel sulfur as emission requirements become more stringent. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The crystal is designed to be phase reserved for two difference frequency generation processes so that the predesigned dual-wavelength terahertz radiation at 1.43 THz and 2.07 THz can be achieved simultaneously. The estimated effective nonlinear coefficient as a function of the terahertz radiation frequencies is also included in our discussion.

Two-particle correlations of direct photon triggers with associated hadrons are obtained by statistical subtraction of the decay photon-hadron (γ-h) background. The initial momentum of the away-side parton is tightly constrained, because the parton-photon pair exactly balance in momentum at leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics, making such correlations a powerful probe of the in-medium parton energy loss. The away-side nuclear suppression factor, IAA, in central Au+Au collisions, is 0.32±0.12stat±0.09syst for hadrons of 3<pTh<5 in coincidence with photons of 5<pTγ<15 GeV/c. The suppression is comparable to that observed for high-pT single hadrons and dihadrons. The direct photon associated yields in p+p collisions scale approximately with the momentum balance, zT pTh/pTγ, as expected for a measurement of the away-side parton fragmentation function. We compare to Au+Au collisions for which the momentum balance dependence of the nuclear modification should be sensitive to the path-length dependence of parton energy loss. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The neutral pions are reconstructed from photons measured either by the STAR Barrel Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter or by the Time Projection Chamber via tracking of conversion electron-positron pairs. Our measurements are compared to previously published π± and π0 results. The nuclear modification factors RCP and RAA of π0 are also presented as a function of pT. In the most central Au+Au collisions, the binary collision scaled π0 yield at high pT is suppressed by a factor of about 5 compared to the expectation from the yield of p+p collisions. Such a large suppression is in agreement with previous observations for light quark mesons and is consistent with the scenario that partons suffer considerable energy loss in the dense medium formed in central nucleus-nucleus collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

Emission levels of oxides of nitrogen (NOX) were not improved from previous emission control steps. Compared with Xi'an, the emission rate is lower in Beijing, which is strong evidence of the effectiveness of the present comprehensive emission control strategy in Beijing.

A corner-pumped Nd:YAG/YAG composite slab continuous-wave 1319 nm/1338 nm dual-wavelength laser is first demonstrated in this paper. When the cavity length is 25 mm, the maximal output power is up to 7.62 W with a slope efficiency of 16.6% and an optical-to-optical conversion efficiency of 17%. The corresponding spectral line widths of 1319 nm laser and 1338 nm laser are 0.11 and 0.1 nm, respectively. The short-term instability of the output power is better than 1% when the pumping power is 39.5 W. The experimental results show that a corner-pumped type is a kind of feasible schedules in the design of diode-pumped solid-state 1.3 μm lasers with low or medium output powers. © 2010 by Astro Ltd.

77649125267	Double-helicity dependence of jet properties from dihadrons in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at √s=200GeV	It has been postulated that partonic orbital angular momentum can lead to a significant double-helicity dependence in the net transverse momentum of Drell-Yan dileptons produced in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions. Analogous effects are also expected for dijet production. If confirmed by experiment, this hypothesis, which is based on semiclassical arguments, could lead to a new approach for studying the contributions of orbital angular momentum to the proton spin. We report the first measurement of the double-helicity dependence of the dijet transverse momentum in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at √s=200GeV from data taken by the PHENIX experiment in 2005 and 2006. The analysis deduces the transverse momentum of the dijet from the widths of the near- and far-side peaks in the azimuthal correlation of the dihadrons. When averaged over the transverse momentum of the triggered particle, the difference of the root mean square of the dijet transverse momentum between like- and unlike-helicity collisions is found to be -37±88stat±14systMeV/c. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

77952794314	Efficient corner-pumped Nd:YAG/YAG composite slab laser	A corner-pumped type is a new pumping type in the diode-pumped all-solid-state lasers, which has the advantages of high pump efficiency and favourable pump uniformity. A highly efficient corner-pumped Nd:YAG/YAG composite slab laser is demonstrated in this paper. The maximal continuous-wave output power of the 1064 nm laser is up to 18.57 W with a slope efficiency and an optical-to-optical conversion efficiency of 44.9% and 39.8%, respectively. Inserting an acousto-optic Q-switch in the cavity, the highest average output power of the quasi-continuous wave 1064 nm laser of 6.73 W is obtained at a repetition rate of 9.26 kHz. The experimental results show that a corner-pumped type is a kind of feasible schedules in the design of diode-pumped all-solid-state lasers with low or medium output powers. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

77953741186	Transition in yield and azimuthal shape modification in dihadron correlations in relativistic heavy ion collisions	Hard-scattered parton probes produced in collisions of large nuclei indicate large partonic energy loss, possibly with collective produced-medium response to the lost energy. We present measurements of π0 trigger particles at transverse momenta pTt=4-12GeV/c and associated charged hadrons (pTa=0.5-7GeV/c) vs relative azimuthal angle Δφ in Au+Au and p+p collisions at √sNN=200GeV. The Au+Au distribution at low pTa, whose shape has been interpreted as a medium effect, is modified for pTt<7GeV/c. At higher pTt, the data are consistent with unmodified or very weakly modified shapes, even for the lowest measured pTa, which quantitatively challenges some medium response models. The associated yield of hadrons opposing the trigger particle in Au+Au relative to p+p (IAA) is suppressed at high pT (IAA ≈ 0.35-0.5), but less than for inclusive suppression (RAA ≈ 0.2). © 2010 The American Physical Society.

Photons from the decay π0→γγ were detected in the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter of the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The η→γγ decay was also observed and constituted the first η measurement by STAR. The first direct photon cross-section measurement by STAR is also presented; the signal was extracted statistically by subtracting the π0, η, and ω(782) decay background from the inclusive photon distribution observed in the calorimeter. The analysis is described in detail, and the results are found to be in good agreement with earlier measurements and with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

The J/ψ polarization is studied in the helicity, Gottfried-Jackson, and Collins-Soper frames for pT<5GeV/c and |y|<0.35. The polarization in the helicity and Gottfried-Jackson frames is consistent with zero for all transverse momenta, with a slight (1.8 sigma) trend towards longitudinal polarization for transverse momenta above 2GeV/c. No conclusion is allowed due to the limited acceptance in the Collins-Soper frame and the uncertainties of the current data. The results are compared to observations for other collision systems and center of mass energies and to different quarkonia production models. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

77955611206	Transverse momentum dependence of η meson suppression in Au+Au collisions at √sNN=200 GeV	New measurements by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider for η production at midrapidity as a function of transverse momentum (pT) and collision centrality in √sNN=200 GeV Au+Au and p+p collisions are presented. They indicate nuclear modification factors (RAA) which are similar in both magnitude and trend to those found in earlier π0 measurements. Linear fits to RAA as a function of pT in 5-20 GeV/c show that the slope is consistent with zero within two standard deviations at all centralities, although a slow rise cannot be excluded. Having different statistical and systematic uncertainties, the π0 and η measurements are complementary at high pT; thus, along with the extended pT range of these data they can provide additional constraints for theoretical modeling and the extraction of transport properties. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

Muons were detected in the momentum range from 5 GeV/. c to 1 TeV/. c. The surface flux ratio is measured to be 1.2766±0.0032(stat.)±0.0032(syst.), independent of the muon momentum, below 100 GeV/. c. This is the most precise measurement to date. At higher momenta the data are consistent with an increase of the charge ratio, in agreement with cosmic ray shower models and compatible with previous measurements by deep-underground experiments. © 2010.

77956151577	Balance functions from Au+Au, d+Au, and p+p collisions at √sNN=200 GeV	Balance functions have been measured for charged-particle pairs, identified charged-pion pairs, and identified charged-kaon pairs in Au+Au, d+Au, and p+p collisions at √sNN=200 GeV at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider using the STAR detector. These balance functions are presented in terms of relative pseudorapidity, Δη, relative rapidity, Δy, relative azimuthal angle, Δ, and invariant relative momentum, qinv. For charged-particle pairs, the width of the balance function in terms of Δη scales smoothly with the number of participating nucleons, while hijing and urqmd model calculations show no dependence on centrality or system size. For charged-particle and charged-pion pairs, the balance functions widths in terms of Δη and Δy are narrower in central Au+Au collisions than in peripheral collisions. The width for central collisions is consistent with thermal blast-wave models where the balancing charges are highly correlated in coordinate space at breakup. This strong correlation might be explained by either delayed hadronization or limited diffusion during the reaction. Furthermore, the narrowing trend is consistent with the lower kinetic temperatures inherent to more central collisions. In contrast, the width of the balance function for charged-kaon pairs in terms of Δy shows little centrality dependence, which may signal a different production mechanism for kaons. The widths of the balance functions for charged pions and kaons in terms of qinv narrow in central collisions compared to peripheral collisions, which may be driven by the change in the kinetic temperature. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

77957597955	Azimuthal anisotropy of π0 production in Au+Au collisions at √sNN=200GeV: Path-length dependence of jet quenching and the role of initial geometry	We have measured the azimuthal anisotropy of π0 production for 1<pT<18GeV/c for Au+Au collisions at √sNN=200GeV. The observed anisotropy shows a gradual decrease for 3pT7-10GeV/c, but remains positive beyond 10GeV/c. The magnitude of this anisotropy is underpredicted, up to at least ∼10GeV/c, by current perturbative QCD (PQCD) energy-loss model calculations. An estimate of the increase in anisotropy expected from initial-geometry modification due to gluon saturation effects and fluctuations is insufficient to account for this discrepancy. Calculations that implement a path-length dependence steeper than what is implied by current PQCD energy-loss models show reasonable agreement with the data. ©2010 The American Physical Society.

A continuous-wave corner-pumped Nd:YAG/YAG composite slab multi-wavelength laser at around 1.1 μm is demonstrated. The maximal output power is up to 12.06 W with an opticalto-optical conversion efficiency of 24%. At an output power of 10.3 W, the M2 factors of beam quality at width and thickness directions are 7.71 and 2.44, respectively. With a LBO crystal inserted in the cavity, continuouswave yellow-green laser with an output power of 841 mW is obtained. The experimental results show that a corner-pumping is a feasible scheme in the design of diode-pumped solid-state 1.1 μm lasers and their frequencydoubling to the yellow-green with low or medium output powers. © 2010 Optical Society of America.

The data sample of the study corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.9pb⊃-1 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The dijet centrality ratio, which quantifies the angular distribution of the dijets, is measured as a function of the invariant mass of the dijet system and is found to agree with the predictions of the standard model. A statistical analysis of the data provides a lower limit on the energy scale of quark contact interactions. The sensitivity of the analysis is such that the expected limit is 2.9 TeV; because the observed value of the centrality ratio at high invariant mass is below the expectation, the observed limit is 4.0 TeV at the 95% confidence level. © 2010 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

The measurement was performed over the rapidity ranges 1.2<|y|<2.2 and |y|<0.35 for transverse momenta up to 6GeV/c. J/ψ production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider is dominated by processes involving initial-state gluons, and transverse single-spin asymmetries of the J/ψ can provide access to gluon dynamics within the nucleon. Such asymmetries may also shed light on the long-standing question in QCD of the J/ψ production mechanism. Asymmetries were obtained as a function of J/ψ transverse momentum and Feynman-x, with a value of -0.086±0.026stat±0.003syst in the forward region. This result suggests possible nonzero trigluon correlation functions in transversely polarized protons and, if well defined in this reaction, a nonzero gluon Sivers distribution function. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35 pb-1 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is performed in events with jets and significant missing transverse energy, characteristic of the decays of heavy, pair-produced squarks and gluinos. The primary background, from standard model multijet production, is reduced by several orders of magnitude to a negligible level by the application of a set of robust kinematic requirements. With this selection, the data are consistent with the standard model backgrounds, namely tt, W. +. jet and Z. +. jet production, which are estimated from data control samples. Limits are set on the parameters of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model.

The main goal of the calibration is to determine, for each drift cell, the minimum time delay for signals relative to the trigger, accounting for the drift velocity within the cell.

The data were collected with the CMS detector, at the LHC. A broadening of the away-side (Δø y≈ π) azimuthal correlation is observed at all Δν, as compared to the measurements in pp collisions. Furthermore, long-range dihadron correlations in Δν are observed for particles with similar ø values. This phenomenon, also known as the \ridge", persists up to at least jΔνj = 4. For particles with transverse momenta (pT) of 2-4 GeV/c, the ridge is found to be most prominent when these particles are correlated with particles of pT = 2-6 GeV/c, and to be much reduced when paired with particles of pT = 10-12 GeV/c.

84857775242	Prompt and non-prompt J/ψ production in pp collisions at √s =7 TeV	The production of J/ψ mesons is studied in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC. The measurement is based on a dimuon sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 314 nb<sup>-1</sup>. The J/ψ differential cross section is determined, as a function of the J/ψ transverse momentum, in three rapidity ranges. A fit to the decay length distribution is used to separate the prompt from the non-prompt (b hadron to J/ψ) component. Integrated over J/ψ transverse momentum from 6.5 to 30 GeV/c and over rapidity in the range {pipe}y{pipe} < 2.4, the measured cross sections, times the dimuon decay branching fraction, are 70.9 ± 2.1(stat.) ± 3.0(syst.) ± 7.8(luminosity) nb for prompt J/ψ mesons assuming unpolarized production and 26.0 ± 1.4(stat.) ± 1.6(syst.) ± 2.9(luminosity) nb for J/ψ mesons from b-hadron decays. © CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration 2011.

84860360064	Search for microscopic black holes in pp collisions at √ s = 7 TeV	A search for microscopic black holes in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7TeV is presented. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb1 recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011. Events with large total transverse energy have been analyzed for the presence of multiple energetic jets, leptons, and photons, which are typical signals of evaporating semiclassical and quantum black holes, and string balls. Agreement with the expected standard model backgrounds, which are dominated by QCD multijet production, has been observed for various combined multiplicities of jets and other reconstructed objects in the final state. Model-independent limits are set on new physics processes producing high-multiplicity, energetic final states. In addition, new model-specific indicative limits are set excluding semiclassical and quantum black holes with masses below 3.8 to 5.3TeV and string balls with masses below 4.6 to 4.8TeV . The analysis has a substantially increased sensitivity compared to previous searches.

84863282065	Measurement of the underlying event activity at the LHC with √s = 7 TeV and comparison with √s = 0:9 TeV	A measurement of the underlying activity in events with a jet of transverse momentum in the several GeV region is performed in proton-proton collisions at √ s = 0:9 and 7TeV, using data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The production of charged particles with pseudorapidity |η|<2 and transverse momentum pT >0:5 GeV/c is studied in the azimuthal region transverse to that of the leading set of charged particles forming a track-jet. A significant growth of the average multiplicity and scalar-pT sum of the particles in the transverse region is observed with increasing pT of the leading trackjet, followed by a much slower rise above a few GeV/c. For track-jet pT larger than a few GeV/c, the activity in the transverse region is approximately doubled with a centreof- mass energy increase from 0:9 to 7TeV. Predictions of several QCD-inspired models as implemented in pythia are compared to the data.

84864316075	Theoretical study on thermal focal length of corner-pumped lasers	A novel method to calculate the thermal focal length of corner-pumped slab lasers is proposed. Traditional methods generally use uniform distribution or exponential decay distribution to characterize the heat distribution, and the difference between calculation results and the experimental value is not small which is against the further cavity design. Tracepro software is used to trace the pump light in the medium so as to get the accurate heat distribution within the gain medium, and then the temperature distribution and thermal focal length is calculated. The calculation results of this method are according with experiments much better than those of the traditional. This method is of general applicability, and is especially suitable for lasers with novel pump ways and special shape gain media.

84866527479	Observation of direct-photon collective flow in Au+Au collisions at √S<inf>NN</inf> = 200 GeV	The second Fourier component v2 of the azimuthal anisotropy with respect to the reaction plane was measured for direct photons at midrapidity and transverse momentum (pT) of 1-13 GeV/c in Au+Au collisions at √S<inf>NN</inf> = 200 GeV. Previous measurements of this quantity for hadrons with pT < 6 GeV/c indicate that the medium behaves like a nearly perfect fluid, while for pT > 6 GeV/c a reduced anisotropy is interpreted in terms of a path-length dependence for parton energy loss. In this measurement with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider we find that for pT > 4 GeV/c the anisotropy for direct photons is consistent with zero, as expected if the dominant source of direct photons is initial hard scattering. However, in the pT < 4 GeV/c region dominated by thermal photons, we find a substantial direct photon v<inf>2</inf> comparable to that of hadrons, whereas model calculations for thermal photons in this kinematic region significantly underpredict the observed v<inf>2</inf>.

The observable measures the angular correlations of jets and is defined as the number of neighboring jets above a given transverse momentum threshold which accompany a given jet within a given distance δR in the plane of rapidity and azimuthal angle. The ensemble average over all jets in an inclusive jet sample is measured and the results are presented as a function of transverse momentum of the inclusive jets, in different regions of δR and for different transverse momentum requirements for the neighboring jets.

84868541278	Measurement of jet fragmentation into charged particles in pp and PbPb collisions at √s 	Jet fragmentation in pp and PbPb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 2.76TeV per nucleon pair was studied using data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Fragmentation functions are constructed using charged-particle tracks with transverse momenta pT > 4 GeV/c for dijet events with a leading jet of pT > 100 GeV/c. The fragmentation functions in PbPb events are compared to those in pp data as a function of collision centrality, as well as dijet-pT imbalance. Special emphasis is placed on the most central PbPb events including dijets with unbalanced momentum, indicative of energy loss of the hard scattered parent partons. The fragmentation patterns for both the leading and subleading jets in PbPb collisions agree with those seen in pp data at 2.76TeV. The results provide evidence that, despite the large parton energy loss observed in PbPb collisions, the partition of the remaining momentum within the jet cone into high-pT particles is not strongly modified in comparison to that observed for jets in vacuum.

84878933146	Search for heavy resonances in the W/Z-tagged dijet mass spectrum in pp collisions at 7 TeV	A search has been made for massive resonances decaying into a quark and a vector boson, qW or qZ, or a pair of vector bosons, WW, WZ, or ZZ, where each vector boson decays to hadronic final states. This search is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb<sup>-1</sup> of proton-proton collisions collected in the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. For sufficiently heavy resonances the decay products of each vector boson are merged into a single jet, and the event effectively has a dijet topology. The background from QCD dijet events is reduced using recently developed techniques that resolve jet substructure. A 95% CL lower limit is set on the mass of excited quark resonances decaying into qW (qZ) at 2.38 TeV (2.15 TeV) and upper limits are set on the cross section for resonances decaying to qW, qZ, WW, WZ, or ZZ final states.

84879054336	Analysis and modeling of a thermal focal length in a corner-pumped composite slab laser	A simulation method was developed to calculate the thermal focal length for corner-pumped composite slab lasers. Traditional methods assume a uniform heat distribution or an exponential decay heat distribution to simplify the calculation, but the results do not agree well with experimental data for the thermal focal length, which affects the laser resonator design. In the current model, the heat distribution is obtained from the ray trace software Tracepro, which can accurately calculate the pump light absorption distribution in the gain medium. The simulation results with this method have a relative error of 4% compared to experimental results, which is much better than traditional methods with relative errors of 14% for corner-pumped composite slab lasers and demonstrates the effectiveness of this method for the development of new lasers. © 2013 Astro Ltd.

The extracted v2 coefficients are found to be consistent between the two meson species over the measured pT range. The ratio of v4/v22 for π0 mesons is found to be independent of pT for 1-9 GeV/c, implying a lack of sensitivity of the ratio to the change of underlying physics with pT. Furthermore, the ratio of v4/v22 is systematically larger in central collisions, which may reflect the combined effects of fluctuations in the initial collision geometry and finite viscosity in the evolving medium. © 2013 American Physical Society.

Results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb<sup>−1</sup>recorded in proton-proton collisions at (Formula presented.) = 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC.
