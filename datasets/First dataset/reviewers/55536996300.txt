84949117212	Cooperatively tuning phase size and absorption of near IR photons in P3HT:perylene diimide solar cells by bay-modifications on the acceptor	P3HT is a widely used and commercial polymer donor, but it cannot absorb near IR solar photons. Chemical accessibility to tune the frontier molecular orbits of π-conjugated small molecule acceptors increases the possibility to improve their near IR absorption, which is complementary to P3HT. Taking the aggregation tendency of the planar π-system into account, we herein use the traditional n-type organic semiconductor of perylene diimide (PDI) as the model backbone, showing a molecular way to cooperatively tune the aggregation tendency and absorption of the near IR photons. Practically, we replace the 2-methoxylethoxyl units from the mother PDI monomer (OPDI-O), one-by-one, with the 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl) benzo[1,2-b′:4,5-b′]-dithiophene (BDT) moieties, giving two other PDI monomers of B-PDI-O and BPDI-B. Because of the photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer transition from the BDT unit to the PDI core, B-PDI-B exhibits a broad absorption shoulder beyond 600 nm in the dilute solution, and beyond 650 nm in the solid film. This red-shifted absorption enhances usage of the near IR photons of the solar emission when using P3HT as the donor. The steric effects between the PDI and BDT planes produce twisted conformations, which effectively suppress aggregation tendency. The domain size decreases from >0.5 μm (O-PDI-O) to ∼100 nm (B-PDI-O) and then ∼20 nm (B-PDI-B) with using 4% DIO as additive. Consistently, the short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, and efficiency of the optimal P3HT:PDI best cells all increase as BDT unit is introduced on the bay-region.

9644268006	Size-dependent exciton chirality in (R)-(+)-1,1′-Bi-2-naphthol dimethyl ether nanoparticles	Organic nanoparticles from a chiral auxiliary, (R)-(+)-1,1′-bl-2- naphthol dimethyl ether (BNDE), with a range of particle sizes from 25 to 100 nm were fabricated through the reprecipitation method. It is found that BNDE nanoparticles exhibit positive exciton chirality in 200-260 nm region in circular dichroism (CD) spectra, which are completely opposite to CD spectra of the dilute solution. The exciton chirality of the particles displays size-dependent behavior; that is, the exciton chirality peaks evolve to the low-energy side with increase in particles size. CD spectra accompanied with UV, fluorescence spectra, lifetime measurements of the excited states, and quantum mechanical calculations reveal that the chirality inversion results from intermolecular exciton coupling between two adjacent BNDE molecules in the nanoparticles, and the bathochromic shift of the peaks is attributed to the increased intermolecular interaction with increasing particle size.

24644522906	Tunable emission from doped 1,3,5-triphenyI-2-pyrazoline organic nanoparticles	The tunable emission from doped organic nanoparticles (NP) of 1,3,5-triphenyl-2-pyrazoline (TPP), which are doped with 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2- methyl-6-(p-dimethyl-aminostyryl)-4H-pyran, was analyzed. All the NPs were prepared through the reprecipitation method in which mixtures of TPP and DCM in ethanol were used. The aqueous dispersions of DCM-doped TPP NPs are found to show different emission colors depending on the solutions used in preparation. The tunable emission of the NPs is illustrated by the evolution of the fluorescence spectra of their aqueous dispersions with changing DCM content. The results show that the tunable emission is attributed to the change in the degree of aggregation of DCM molecules in the NPs.

23744469722	Thermally enhanced visible-light photochromism of phosphomolybdic acid-polyvinylpyrrolidone hybrid films	Phosphomolybdic acid/polyvinylpyrrolidone hybrid films were found to show visible light photochromism. It is identified that the intra-supramolecular charge transfer between the inorganic and organic molecules is responsible for the visible-light coloration. Interestingly, the films show photo-memory and thermal activation. The films show a small change in absorbance after being irradiated with visible light for a short time, and the coloration can be enhanced greatly by subsequent thermal treatment. Electrical measurements indicate that the conductivity of the film increases after the brief irradiation, which promotes transfer of the electrons induced by the thermal treatment. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

25144506593	Multicolor photochromism of polymolybdate-citric acid composite films	Photochromic polymolybdate-citric acid composite films were fabricated. It was found that after UV irradiation the composite films with different molar ratios of organic/inorganic components exhibited different colors. The UV-irradiated films showed dark blue, dark khaki and light sea green colors when the ratios were 1.0, 0.3 and 0.2, respectively. It was identified by Raman spectra that the polymolybdate species formed in the composite films after UV irradiation were sensitive to the ratios of the organic/inorganic components, thus resulting in the different colors of irradiated films. Citric acid played an important role during the photochromic process. Under UV light irradiation, it served as hole scavenger that suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes to make the polymolybdates show UV light photochromism. © 2005 SIOC, CAS, & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The architecture evolutions of these mesostructures at the earlier stages of their formation confirm that the mesostructures result from multistage aggregation processes.

By varying the bad solvents, the products morphology was conveniently tuned from tabular shape (in n-pentane) to quasi-nanorods (in n-hexane) and spherical crystalline particles (in water). The intermolecular interactions between solvents and DTTC, and the cohesion parameters were used for evaluating the influences of bad solvents on the particles formation.

The enhanced and size-tunable off-resonant third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) responses of these nanoparticles were confirmed. The NLO enhancement of the nanoparticles compared to that of the monomer was demonstrated to originate from the increased Intra-CT process due to the improved planarity of the ligands in the particles. The size-dependent NLO responses of the nanoparticles were attributed to the gradual predominance of the Inter-CT at the expense of the Intra-CT with increasing the particle size. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A series of characterizations indicated that the tubes were obtained from the rolling followed by seaming of a preorganized two-dimensional sheet-like structure, whose formation was due to the efficient cooperation of several molecular recognition elements. The length and diameter of the TPI tubes can be readily controlled by adjusting the experimental conditions. The as-prepared submicrotubes have intensive luminescence and size-dependent optical properties, which allows them to find potential applications in novel optical and optoelectronic devices together with their single crystalline structure and good stability.

33644542125	A hierarchical self-assembly of 4,5-diphenylimidazole on copper	The hierarchical self-assembly of an organic low-molecular-weight compound, 4,5-diphenylimidazole (DPI), from single molecules to 2D building blocks to higher-order mesostructures was induced successfully by the cooperation of coordination and several weak interactions at copper-solution interface. The morphologies and properties of the as-obtained DPI hierarchical mesostructures can be readily controlled by changing the assembly conditions such as the sort of solvent, the DPI concentration and the ripening time. The measurements of ESI-MS, FT-IR and Auger electron spectroscopes indicate that the complex formed by the coordination between DPI and copper plays an important role in that it provides a center for the nucleation and growth of the 2D sheet-like basic units. The DPI mesostructures can change the property of copper surface and endow the copper with novel surface performances. Moreover, it should be feasible to extend the strategy described here to other metal-ligand systems. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33646139637	Photochromism in composite and hybrid materials based on transition-metal oxides and polyoxometalates	Photochromic materials are attractive and promising for applications in many fields. One subject in this area is to prepare and study the photochromism in composite or hybrid materials based on transition-metal oxides or polyoxometalates. Their properties not depend only on the chemical nature of each component, but also on the interface and synergy between them. Since the charge transfer plays a key role in the photochromism of these materials, it is very important to increase the charge (electrons, holes, and protons) interactions between the two components in either composites or hybrids. To realize this, one big challenge is to optimize the two components on a molecular or nanometer scale, which is closely relevant to the constituents, sample history (pre-treatment, preparation, and post-treatment), environment (humidity, presence of reducible or oxidizible matters, light-irradiation wavelength, intensity, time, etc.). Based on these, many novel composite or hybrid materials with improved photochromism, visible-light coloration, reversible photochromism, multicolor photochromism or, possibly, fast photoresponse, have been prepared during the last two decades or three. This may underscore the opportunity of using these composite and hybrid materials as the photonic applications. In present paper, we summarize thoroughly all the recent progress in these subjects. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33744793790	2,4,5-triphenylimidazole nanowires with fluorescence narrowing spectra prepared through the adsorbent-assisted physical vapor deposition method	The single crystalline nanowires have been fabricated from a small organic functional molecule, 2,4,5-triphenylimidazole (TPI), through an adsorbent-assisted physical vapor deposition (PVD) method. The introduction of the absorbents can significantly improve the dimensional uniformity of the as-prepared TPI nanowires. The TPI nanowires displayed interesting size-dependent optical properties, that is, the absorption spectra of the wires exhibit an obvious blue shift with the decrease of diameter, and simultaneously, the vibrational fine structures of the emission spectra emerge and become more pronounced with the diameter decreasing from 500 to 40 nm even at room temperature, which are usually observed only under cryogenic conditions. The emergence and enhancement of the vibrational structures are contributed to the increase of the long-range order and the degree of orientation with the decrease of diameter. The strategy described here should give a useful enlightenment for the fabrication of wirelike nanostructures from small organic molecules. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

33646800180	On the formation of nanostructures from stilbazolium-like dyes	Nanostructures with well-defined shape and highly monodisperse size were fabricated from model stilbazolium-like dyes with specific molecular structural and conformational characteristics. With the help of absorption and fluorescence optical spectroscopy, the correlated spectroscopy (COSY) and two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (2D NOESY) techniques, along with X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement, distinctively different aggregation processes of the model molecules are demonstrated. For model dye molecule with linear donor-π system-acceptor (D-π-A) structure, strong D-A pair, and planar conformation, specific intermolecular interaction was identified and special crystal structures as well as spectral properties were observed. For model dye molecules bearing nonlinear D-π-A-π-D structure, weak D-A pair but actual amphiphilic characteristics, a special aggregation process was confirmed and a focused size distribution of the produced nanostructures was obtained. © Springer 2006.

33746920315	Temperature-dependent ratiometric fluorescence from an organic aggregates system	The aggregates of 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole (HBO), a typical molecule exhibiting excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), were prepared and the photophysical properties of the aqueous dispersion of aggregates were investigated. It is found that the aggregates and the solvated enols coexist in the aqueous dispersion system. Furthermore, the aggregates undergo ESIPT to give rise to keto for green emission, while the solvated enols give rise to blue emission. The temperature effects on the aqueous dispersion of the HBO aggregates system were also explored. It shows a fluorescent ratiometric change in a range of temperature from 15 to 60°C. A mechanism of a temperature-dependent equilibrium between the aggregates and the solvated enols is proposed for the fluorescence change. The reversibility and robustness as well as the stability of the aqueous dispersion of aggregates show very good performances, which may be useful in the applications of molecular fluorescent temperature sensors or molecular thermometers. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

The exciton chirality and the fluorescence emission of the particles display size-tunable behaviors. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the nanoparticles experience a bathochromic shift with an increase in the particle size and the intensity ratio of the first to the third cotton effect (CE) increases as the nanoparticle size increases to 60 nm. And also the nanoparticles show excimer emission that enhances as the particle size grows. CD spectra accompanied with UV, fluorescence emission spectra, reveal that the size-tunable optical properties are attributed to the synergetic effect of the change of dihedral angle in the initial stage and the more effective formation of excimer between the two naphthalene chromophores in adjacent molecules as nanoparticles grow. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

33847765381	Manipulation of the morphology of ZnSe sub-micron structures using CdSe nanocrystals as the seeds	ZnSe sub-microstructures with different morphologies, sizes, and microstructures were synthesized by a modified vapor deposition method using CdSe nanocrystals (NCs) as the seeds. On the basis of the appearance of the as-synthesized products, we show that the substrate temperature and CdSe NCs are the critical factors for controlling the size and the structure of various ZnSe sub-micro structures. By manipulating the growth driving force (i.e., the degree of supersaturation), the morphology of the ZnSe crystals can be varied sequentially from nanobelts to meso-scale rods to wires/branched wires. Their morphologies and structures were characterized by X-ray spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The nanobelts grew along the [01 -10] direction, whereas the meso-scale rods and wires grew along [0001]. Cathodoluminescence properties and growth mechanisms of these ZnSe structures are also discussed. The present results suggest that the simple method might be useful for the synthesis of other semiconductor nanostructures with manipulated morphologies to meet the growing demands of nanoscale science and technology. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

The mechanism of the fluorescence switch is the intermolecular energy transfer as supported by both steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy results. The addition of BPP not only enhances the contrast of the fluorescence signal between the 'ON' and 'OFF' state, but also provides a convenient way to tune the excitation wavelength for reading the fluorescence. High-contrast ON/OFF (20:1) fluorescence switching is successfully implemented in the CNPs and also in a more practical PVA film loaded with the CNPs. This system may represent an alternative to the covalent system in potentially rewritable high-density optical data or image storage utilizing luminescence intensity readout schemes. © IOP Publishing Ltd.

Time-dependent density functional theory calculations with inclusion of polarizable continuum model have been performed to reveal the origin of this splitting. It is found that the spectral splitting caused by the formation of dimers and interaction with two water molecules are much smaller than what was predicted by previous semi-empirical study. Our calculations indicate that the experimentally observed large Q-band splitting can be explained by considering the geometrical distortions that are associated with changes of bonds between carbon and nitrogen atoms. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Both UV-vis absorption spectra and thermal bleaching kinetics indicate that the blue solution differs from the open form of SPO, i.e., photomerocyanine (PMC), and computer assisted simulations show that the blue solution is a complex composed of one PMCH and two water molecules, which are connected through hydrogen bonds. Thus, water has a characteristic effect on PMCH, and this phenomenon is proposed as waterchromism. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34548132367	Synthesis of pyrene-1-carbaldehyde nanorods and emission tuning by the fluorescent ratiometric change	Pyrene-1-carbaldehyde (PyCHO) nanorods were prepared by a simple reprecipitation method. The morphologies and the structures of the as-prepared PyCHO nanorods were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Unlike pyrene, PyCHO has a preferable packing direction due to the hydrophilic group (CHO), facilitating the formation of one-dimensional structures. The photophysical properties of the as-prepared aqueous dispersions of PyCHO nanorods were investigated, and it is found that the aggregates and the solvated PyCHO coexist in the aqueous dispersion system. Upon increasing the concentration of PyCHO, the emission of the solvated PyCHO was quenched while the emission of the nanostructures gradually increased. Thus, an emission tuning was achieved by the fluorescent ratiometric change in the aqueous suspension and in the polymer film blended with PyCHO nanostructures, which may provide an alternative way to achieve tunable emission. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Awl-holders were well-rectangular faceted, and the diameter of the awl tips were in the range of 100-200 nm. Highresolution transmission electron microscopy shows that the nanoawls were single crystals growing along the [120] direction, which is different from the conventional [001] orientation. The optical properties of the ZnS nanoawls are also studied by Raman scattering and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The strong green emissions indicate that the nanoawls are promising for application in nanoscale optoelectronic devices. Furthermore, a possible two-stage growth mechanism of the ZnS nanoawls was also briefly discussed.

35648933453	Photochromic materials based on tungsten oxide	Tungsten oxide exhibits pronounced photochromism upon bandgap photoexcitation, which makes it attractive and promising for applications in many areas. Some advances have been achieved during the past decades. The research on nanocrystalline films and single crystals indicates the critical importance of defects in tungsten oxide to its photochromism. Based on energy-band engineering of semiconductors, enhancement of photochromism has been achieved, for instance, extension of the photoresponse from UV to visible light by cathodic polarization, improved change in absorption before and after coloration through modification by a noble metal or another metal-oxide semiconductor, and increased photochromic reversibility via hybridization with organic amines.

In three different kinds of emitting centers coexist in the nanocrystalline nanostructures, blue centers came from the monomer, while the green and red ones were result from the defect energy levels.

The ground state dipole moment of the open form (photomerocyanine, MC) is much larger than that of SP, thus it can induce the transformation of aggregated TPPS to its monomer, which is confirmed by UV-Vis absorption spectra, RLS spectra, and fluorescence lifetime. While TPPS aggregate has a fluorescence self-quenching phenomenon, its fluorescence was greatly enhanced after the formation of monomer. When the mixture was exposed to visible light, MC decayed back to SP, and consequently, TPPS monomer aggregated again, which resulted in its fluorescence turn off.

37249032834	An application of AAO template: Orderly assembled organic molecules for surface-enhanced Raman scattering	High-density ordered arrays of core-shell nano-pillars of Ag-perylene were fabricated using an anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) template which was first embedded with the perylene molecules, followed by an electrochemical deposition of Ag. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectrum obtained from this system showed well-resolved Raman peaks with good signal-to-noise ratios and little fluorescence background. This is in sharp contrast to the SERS of the individual Ag-perylene nanorods removed from the same AAO template, and the SERS of perylene molecules adsorbed on Ag colloidal nanoparticles. In the latter two cases, the SERS spectra consisted of broad and not-so-well-resolved Raman peaks with a strong fluorescence background. It is believed that the orderly assembly of the perylene molecules on the inner walls of the pores of the AAO template along the Ag nano-pillars led to fluorescence quenching. The high-density ordered arrays of Ag nano-pillars brought forth a surface plasmon resonance for the SERS effect. The present AAO template system offers a new substrate for studying SERS of highly fluorescing molecules. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

0034174586	Nanocrystalline tungsten oxide thin film: Preparation, microstructure, and photochromic behavior	A nanocrystalline tungsten oxide photochromic thin film was prepared by colloid chemistry method. The microstmcture, phase transition involved in the solution process, photochromic behavior, and mechanism of the film were investigated by means of transmission electron microscope, x-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra, and x-ray photoelectron spectra. It was found that the particle size and crystallinity of the thin film could be easily controlled by adjusting the concentration of oxalic acid in the colloid solution of tungsten oxide hydrate. With the increase of the oxalic acid concentration, the size of nanoparticles in the film decreased sharply, and meanwhile, a blue shift of the absorption peaks caused by the quantum size effect was observed accordingly. With the increase of the pH in the solution, tungsten oxide hydrate was gradually transformed into an oxided 12-tungstate with Keggin structure, which led to the change of photochromic property of the films. The photochromism of the film is believed to be due to the electron transfer between the different valence states of tungsten ions located in adjacent sites.

By varying pH in the solution from which the films were prepared, the corresponding structure, constituent phase and photochromic behavior of the films were investigated with transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), absorption spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). It was found that with the increase of the pH of the solution, tungsten oxide hydrate was gradually transformed into an oxided 12-tungstate with Keggin structure. XPS detection revealed that oxided 12-tungstate has a different reduction state from tungsten oxide hydrate when exposed to ultraviolet light, so as to result in the change of photochromic behavior of the films. And the variation of reduction characteristics of the films is believed to be related to the structural transformation of the films caused by pH in the solution.

A sharp fluorescence quenching of the perylene bisimide moiety in these dyads nT-PBI (n -1, 2, and 3) was observed upon photoexcitation of the perylene bisimide moiety, indicating a fast and efficient electron-transfer process. The properties of photoinduced electron transfer of these dyads nT-PBI (n = 1,2, and 3) in solutions were investigated by time-resolved fluorescence spectra and femtosecond transient absorption spectra in the visible region. It was found that as the number of thiophene repeat units, i.e., the size, increases, the rate constants of charge separation and charge recombination increase about 3 orders and over 1 order of magnitude, respectively, because of the combined effects of energetics and electronic coupling. These results demonstrate that a change in size of donor could change and modulate the dynamics of electron transfer. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

The different influences of the positive addition style (in which organic solution of compound was added into water) [Baba et al., Opt.

The effects of the operating modes with or without cycling on the particles, the relationship between the organic compounds hydrophobicity (expressed with the Rekker constants) and particles formation were studied. It seemed that the Rekker constants could be used for the estimation and prediction of particles formation in the preparation of organic particles. The successful control of particles size was attributed to the small droplets size of permeated solution and the relative small hydrophobicity value of the pyrazoline molecule. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

41249097192	Size-tunable synthesis of tetrapod-like ZnS nanopods by seed-epitaxial metal-organic chemical vapor deposition	Single-crystalline tetrapod-like ZnS nanopods were synthesized by a one-step seed-epitaxial metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) approach using cubic CdSe nanocrystals as the seeds. The diameters of the ZnS tetrapods can be easily tuned by changing the distances between the substrates and precursors. A possible growth mechanism is discussed on the basis of the heterostructure epitaxial growth. The ZnS tetrapod has a zinc CdSe nanocrystal core at the center with four wurtzite ZnS arms growing out from the core along four [0001] directions. Due to the lower temperature and versatility, this controllable seed-epitaxial method has potential as a general means of forming complex branching structures and may also offer opportunities for applications as building blocks for optoelectronic devices. © 2008.

PNIPAM-co-PAA microgel particles were synthesized by surfactant-free emulsion polymerization with different crosslinking densities (4.5 wt.-%, 10 wt.-%, 15 wt.-%, MBA to NIPAM) and AuNPs obtained by trisodium citrate reduction method independently. The effect of crosslinking density of synthesized microgel particles on the loadings of AuNPs was investigated. The results showed that 18 ±2 nm AuNPs could be well entrapped in the loosely crosslinked (4.5 wt.-%, MBA to NIPAM) PNIPAM-co-PAA microgel particles with high loadings. The final hybrid microgel particles were well characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and FT-IR. In particular, the PNIPAM-co-PAA/AuNPs hybrid microgel particles were thermoresponsive and completely reversible with several heating/cooling cycles. Therefore, the PNIPAM-co-PAA/AuNPs hybrid microgel particles allow for combined surface plasmon and thermal switching applications.

Polyoxometalates (POMs) were used to serve as both reducing and bridging molecules. Characterization using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, etc. was performed and verified the structure of the prepared nanohybrid of Pt@POM/CNT. The nanohybrid showed a higher electrocatalytic activity towards methanol oxidation reaction than did a traditional Pt-C catalyst and the other reported Pt/CNT systems. The POM also serves as a co-catalyst in the nanohybrid, which plays a key role in improving the electrocatalytic activities of the catalyst. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84896992237	Additive-assisted control over phase-separated nanostructures by manipulating alkylthienyl position at donor backbone for solution-processed, non-fullerene, all-small-molecule solar cells	A non-fullerene, all-small-molecule solar cell (NF-SMSC) device uses the blend of a small molecule donor and a small molecule acceptor as the active layer. Aggregation ability is a key factor for this type of solar cell. Herein, we used the alkylthienyl unit to tune the aggregation ability of the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based small molecule donors. Replacing two alkoxyl units in BDT-O-DPP with two alkylthienyl units yields BDT-T-DPP, and further introducing another two alkylthienyl units into the backbone produces BDT-T-2T-DPP. With the introduction of alkylthienyl, the backbone becomes twisted. As a result, the ππ-stacking strength, aggregation ability, and crystallite size all obey the sequence of BDT-O-DPP > BDT-T-DPP > BDT-T-2T-DPP. When selected a reported perylene diimide dimer of bis-PDI-T-EG as acceptor, the best NF-SMSC device exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 1.34, 2.01, and 1.62%, respectively, for the BDT-O-DPP, BDT-T-DPP, and BDT-T-2T-DPP based system. The BDT-T-DPP/bis-PDI-T-EG system yields the best efficiency of 2.01% among the three combinations. This is due to the moderate aggregation ability of BDT-T-DPP yields moderate phase size of 30-50 nm, whereas the strong aggregation ability of BDT-O-DPP gives a bigger size of 50-80 nm, and the weak aggregation ability of BDT-T-2T-DPP produces a smaller size of 10-30 nm. The BDT-T-DPP/bis-PDI-T-EG combination exhibits balanced hole/electron mobility of 0.022/0.016 cm

84897107125	Adaptive reorganization of 2D molecular nanoporous network induced by coadsorbed guest molecule	The ordered array of nanovoids in nanoporous networks, such as honeycomb, Kagome, and square, provides a molecular template for the accommodation of "guest molecules". Compared with the commonly studied guest molecules featuring high symmetry evenly incorporated into the template, guest molecules featuring lower symmetry are rare to report. Herein, we report the formation of a distinct patterned superlattice of guest molecules by selective trapping of guest molecules into the honeycomb network of trimesic acid (TMA). Two distinct surface patterns have been achieved by the guest inclusion induced adaptive reconstruction of a 2D molecular nanoporous network. The honeycomb networks can synergetically tune the arrangement upon inclusion of the guest molecules with different core size but similar peripherals groups, resulting in a trihexagonal Kagome or triangular patterns. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

46849119988	Photoinduced electron transfer in coaggregates of dicyanonaphthalene and pyrazoline	The photophysical properties of mixed coaggregates containing 1,4-dicyanonaphthalene (DCN) and 1,3,5-triphenyl-2-pyrazoline (TPP) have been studied. The absorption spectra of mixed coaggregates indicate that a charge-transfer complex is not formed in the ground state between DCN and TPP. The fluorescence of TPP in the mixed coaggregates is quenched by DCN, accompanied with a broad and structureless emission at about 560 nm from an exciplex between DCN and TPP. The color of the emission from mixed coaggregates is tunable by changing the DCN content. The excited-state properties of the TPP-DCN molecule pair are investigated theoretically with a quantum chemistry method. The theoretical results have also confirmed that the broad emission at about 560 nm in the mixed coaggregates originates from the exciplex rather than from the charge-transfer complex. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

49649101153	Switch from intra- to intermolecular H-bonds by ultrasound: Induced gelation and distinct nanoscale morphologies	During cooling of the (R)-N-Fmoc-Octylglycine (Fmoc-OG)/cyclohexane solution, gelation is observed exclusively when ultrasound is used as an external stimulus, while deposit is obtained without sonication. The xerogel consists of entangled fibrous network made by interconnected nanofibers, while the deposit comprises large numbers of unbranched nanowires. It is found that the Fmoc-OG molecules form bilayer structures in both the deposit and the gel. However, the ratio (R) between the Fmoc-OG molecules in a stable intramolecular H-bonding conformation and those in a metastable intermolecular H-bonding conformation can be tuned by the ultrasound, R (deposit) > R (gel). The increased population of the intermolecular H-bonding Fmoc-OG molecules induced by the ultrasonication facilitates to the interconnection of nanofibers for the formation of the fibrous network, and therefore gelation. The alteration in the morphologies and properties of the obtained nanomaterials induced by the ultrasound wave demonstrates a potential method for smart controlling of the functions of nanomaterials from the molecular level. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

After introducing the development of inorganic and organic macromolecular nanomaterials, we begin with a general review of the construction strategies for achieving both zero-dimensional (0D) and one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures from small organic functional molecules. We then provide an overview of the unique optoelectronic properties induced by molecular aggregation in the nanostructures. Special emphasis is put on the luminescent properties that are different from those of the corresponding bulk materials, such as aggregation-induced enhanced emission, fluorescence narrowing, multicolor emission, and tunable and switchable emissions from doped nanostructures.

Single crystalline nanowires were prepared from a small organic functional compound TPI, using adsorbent-assisted physical vapor deposition (PVD) method. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) of as-prepared nanowires are found to be consistent with those of TPI powder. A new band is observed at longer wavelengths in the spectra of both TPI nanowires and powder in the region of 370-450 nm, which is attributed to the absorption of TPI aggregates. The tip emission intensity is found to decrease across all emission wavelengths upon an increase in propagation distance. An isolated single TPI nanowire excited with a pulsed laser and PL emissions illustrate PL modulations emerging at the lower energy side of the emission band.

65549085201	The imide-dipeptides that show strong and stable β-sheet-like interactions compared with natural sequence	In this Letter, we report solution behavior of two imide-dipeptides containing l-alanine and l-leucine residues. In contrast to natural sequence, the imide-dipeptidyl backbone contains distinct features: self-pairing H-bonds, topochemical symmetry, a peptide polindron sequence, and different orientations of side chains. The solution behavior in chloroform reveals that both the imide-dipeptides adopt β-folding conformations and form β-sheet-like assembly. Most surprisingly, they form more stable and stronger H-bonds than the natural counterpart, and thus show different H-bonding patterns from the natural sequence. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Strong quenching of the fluorescence of the PBI moiety was observed in both DTT-PBI systems, suggesting the possibility of an efficient intramolecular electron-transfer process. The kinetics of photoinduced electron transfer in the DTT- PBI polymer and monomer in solutions were explored by femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra. It was found that both the rates of charge separation and charge recombination in the DTT-PBI polymer were approximately double those in the small molecule. This indicates that electronic coupling plays an important role in the electron-transfer process in a polymer system. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

We prepared two different types of 2D Au nanorod arrays by means of the anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template-assisted nanofabrication. In the template-embedded array (type I) an Au nanorod fills up the AAO pore, while in the annularly spaced array (type II) an Au nanorod keeps ∼ 20 nm away from the pore wall. The strongest SERS effect was observed for both types of substrates with an Au nanorod diameter of ∼ 66 nm.

67049168856	Morphology-dependent stimulated emission and field emission of ordered CdS nanostructure arrays	Highly ordered CdS nanostructure arrays were successfully fabricated via a simple two-step metal-organic chemical vapor deposition process. Both stimulated emission and field-emission measurements were carried out in an attempt to understand the correlation between the morphologies, alignments, and emission performances of five ordered CdS nanostructure array types (well-aligned truncated nanocones, nanorods, cleft nanorods, quasi-aligned nanowires, and nanowires). The 1D CdS nanostructures of various types displayed notable differences in stimulated and field-emission performances. The stimulated emission strongly correlated with the structure alignment: the better the alignment, the lower the threshold. Both of the alignments and aspect ratios greatly affected the field-emission properties; the CdS emitters of higher aspect ratio and better alignment exhibited better field-emission performance. Thus the well-aligned CdS nanorod arrays had the lower threshold for stimulated emission, and quasi-aligned nanowire arrays produced the higher field-emission current and possessed the lower turn-on fields. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

67649421595	Ultrasound-induced modulations of tetrapeptide hierarchical 1-D self-assembly and underlying molecular structures via sonocrystallization	Herein, we report the ultrasound-induced modulations of the morphologies and underlying molecular structures of tetrapeptide 1-D self-assembly. The self-assembly of the tetrapeptide (TTR108-111) precipitating out of the 1:1 mixed methanol/water is modulated from microtapes into nanotapes, nanofibers, and then bundles of nanorods when subjected to sonication for a period. The sonication-treated and untreated self-assemblies all give a set of equatorial pattern and a series of meridional pattern, indications of a typical "cross-β-structure" as the core structural motif. FTIR data indicate that all the assemblies contain a mixed pattern of β-sheets (dominant) and unstructured conformations (minor), and the relative proportion of unbound structures to β-sheets is as a function of sonication time, suggesting an ultrasound-induced modulation of β-sheet interactions. Accordingly, a possible model regarding a dynamic equilibrium between re-dissolution and re-assembling processes, e.g., a typical sonocrystallization process was proposed for such ultrasound-induced modulations of morphologies and underlying molecular structures. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements reveal that the square and rhombus nanosheets can be indexed to α- and β-phase perylene crystals, respectively. On the basis of the analysis of time-dependent growth processes, we found that selective adhesion of CTAB molecules on the crystal (001) plane facilitates to the formation of sheetlike structures, whereas polymorph transition from α- to β-phase achieved by altering the surfactant CTAB concentration results in the evolution of the nanosheet from square to rhombus morphologies. Single-nanoparticle spectrscopy depicts that square and rhombus nanosheets show distinct shape-dependent optical properties that are directly related to their crystal structures. Furthermore, the optical waveguiding behaviors have been revealed through the scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) technique. This expands the optical waveguides from 1D to 2D nanostructures and has a potential application in novel optoelectronic devices. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

69049119158	The urea-dipeptides show stronger H-bonding propensity to nucleate β-sheetlike assembly than natural sequence	In this article, we report the distinct solution behavior of a set of urea-dipeptides to that of natural sequence. The urea-dipeptides adopt β-folding conformations and form into β-sheetlike assembly in chloroform. Most surprisedly, the urea-dipeptides tend to form interpeptide H-bonding interactions even at a concentration of as low as 0.1 mM, while the natural sequence shows H-bonding propensity at a concentration of about 7 mM, indicating that the urea-dipeptides show much stronger H-bonding propensity to nucleate formation of β-sheetlike assembly than the natural sequence. CD spectra reveal that the investigated urea-dipeptides have two negative CD bands, respectively, around 217 nm and 224 nm, supporting the β-folding conformations and in turn formation of β-sheetlike assembly. The β-sheetlike assembly is also confirmed by the XRD reflections, which give two typical d-spacings of 12.7 and 4.8 Å, respectively, corresponding to stacking periodicity of the β-sheets and the spacing between peptide backbones running orthogonal to the β-sheet axis. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Through simply changing the positions of silicon substrates, the temperatures and the effects of carbon in different zones were modified, and thus the morphologies of CdS nanostructures were varied from multipods to nanobrushes to nanocups. These nanostructures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Cathodoluminescence (CL) measurement shows that the as-grown CdS nanostructures display different luminescent properties. CdS multipods and nanocups show mainly green emission centered at ∼496 nm. However, nanobrushes exhibit predominant red emission band peaking at ∼711 nm. These interesting results show that carbon not only affected the growth process but also influenced the properties of CdS nanostructures. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The length and tip diameter of the arms in CdS multipods could be controlled by simply varying the growth time. With the arm length increasing, the tip diameter successively decreases. Shortarmed multipods (SMPs) are made of both zinc blende and wurtzite phase CdS, while medium-armed multipods (MMPs) and long-armed multipods (LMPs) consist of only hexagonal phase CdS. LMPs exhibit good field-emission (FE) properties with relatively high field-enhancement factor and enhanced luminescence compared to SMPs and MMPs because of the needleshaped arms and high crystallinity. Besides bind energy emission of CdS, LMPs exhibit a broad red emission in CL spectrum because of the arms with high aspect ratios. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77949532176	Construction and optoelectronic properties of organic one-dimensional nanostructures	(Figure Presented) In the last 10 years, nanomaterials based on small organic molecules have attracted increasing attention. Such materials have unique optical and electronic properties, which could lead to new applications in nanoscale devices. Zero-dimensional (0D) organic nanoparticles with amorphous structures have been widely studied; however, the systematic investigation of crystalline one-dimensional (1D) organic nanostructures has only emerged in recent years. Researchers have used inorganic 1D nanomaterials, such as wires, tubes, and belts, as building blocks in optoelectronic nanodevices. We expect that their organic counterparts will also play an important role in this field. Because organic nanomaterials are composed of molecular units with weaker intermolecular interactions, they allow for higher structural tunability, reactivity, and processability. In addition, organic materials usually possess higher luminescence efficiency and can be grown on almost any solid substrate. In this Account, we describe recent progress in our group toward the construction of organic 1D nanomaterials and studies of their unique optical and electronic properties. First, we introduce the techniques for synthesizing 1D organic nanostructures. Because this strategy is both facile and reliable, liquid phase synthesis is most commonly used. More importantly, this method allows researchers to produce composite materials, including core/sheath and uniformly doped structures, which allow to investigate the interactions between different components in the nanomaterials, including fluorescent resonance energy transfer and photoinduced electron transfer. Physical vapor deposition allows for the synthesis of organic 1D nanomaterials with high crystallinity. Nanomaterials produced with this method offer improved charge transport properties and better optoelectronic performance in areas including multicolor emission, tunable emission, optical waveguide, and lasing. Although inorganic nanomaterials have developed rapidly, our findings highlight the importance of organic compounds as components of novel 1D nanomaterials. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77949549663	Rubrene micro-crystals from solution routes: Their crystallography, morphology and optical properties	A series of rubrene micro-crystals (MCs) with controllable sizes and shapes, ranging from one-dimensional (1D) ribbons to 2D rhombic and hexagonal plates, have bee prepared by employing the reprecipitation method. Based on X-ray diffraction analysis, the crystal structures of 1D ribbons and 2D plates have been identified to be triclinic and monoclinic phases, respectively, rather than the commonly reported orthorhombic phase for vacuum-deposited rubrene crystals. In our system, adjustment of the monomer concentration of rubrene, which in turn determines the supersaturation (β) for crystallization, paved the way for kinetic control over the nucleation and growth processes. Combining with theoretical calculations, we found that transformation from a triclinic phase at low supersaturation to a monoclinic phase at high supersaturation was responsible for the morphology change from 1D ribbons to 2D plates. Both ensemble and single-particle spectroscopy clarifies that 1D ribbons and 2D plates show distinct optical properties, probably related to their different solid-state structures in triclinic and monoclinic crystals. Moreover, scanning near-field optical microscopy reveals that the ribbons show waveguiding along a 1D direction, and the plates in a 2D plane. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The thickness of DP belt can be controlled at 200 nm with the width at 2 μm and the length at tens of microns. XRD and SAED indicate that the DP nanobelt grow along the [100] direction due to the π-π stacking of DP molecule. The steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra indicate that DP nanobelts have unique optical properties which are different from the monomers and the bulk crystals. Furthermore, we find the belts are able to absorb the excitation light and propagate the PL emission towards the tips. The results presented in this paper provide useful information for the design and fabrication of optical waveguides from molecular materials.

We begin with a general overview of recent progress in sub-wavelength optical waveguides, including the development of waveguide materials of inorganic semiconductors, polymers, and small organic molecules. Then brief highlights are put on the recently reported organic optical waveguides with various unique optical properties induced by the ordered molecular aggregations in the micro/nano-sized solid-state structures, such as polarized emission, lasing, aggregation-induced enhanced emission, etc. This article concludes with a summary and our personal view about the direction of future development in organic opto-functional waveguides as photonic devices. © 2011 the Owner Societies.

0035494709	Effects of zinc(II) and iron(III) doping of titania films on their photoreactivity to decompose rhodamine B	The heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation of rhodamine B in aqueous solution containing pure or zinc (iron)-doped titania films has been studied. N-deethylation of rhodamine B was accelerated by iron(III) and zinc(II) doping as compared with pure titania film. It is shown that improvement of electron transfer from dye molecules to the film may be responsible for the high N-deethylation rate for iron-doped (0.5 mol%) film, while for zinc-doped (20 mol%) film, high surface roughness may be the main reason. In addition, both iron and zinc doping brought a new shallow trap to the intragap meaning that the surface defects had increased after doping; this is a possible reason doped films present relative low photoreactivity to catalyze the direct degradation of dye molecules.

0035815060	Formation of silver nanoparticles and self-assembled two-dimensional ordered superlattice	1-Nonanethiol-capped silver nanoparticles of about 4.18 nm in diameter were prepared using a liquid-liquid two-phase method. Two-dimensional ordered superlattices of the nanoparticles were formed on carbon films coated on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) copper grids by evaporating a drop of the dispersion in chloroform. The formation process of the silver nanoparticles was investigated by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and TEM. A blue shift of the maximum absorption peak position of the UV-vis spectra occurred at the beginning of the reaction, followed by a red shift. This result indicated that large thiol-capped silver nanoparticles were formed at the beginning, then the large particles were decomposed into small particles, and in the final stage the small particles enlarged slightly again. The TEM images show directly the same process with the results from the UV-vis spectra. In addition, the UV-visible spectra of the silver nanoparticle colloidal phase obtained finally show that the system is monodisperse and can remain stable for several weeks.

0036109902	Preparation and optical size-dependent properties of perylene nanocrystals	Optical size-dependent properties of perylene nanocrystals were studied by the addition of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to a water suspension of perylene nanocrystals prepared by reprecipitation method. Because PVA could bind with the nanocrystals, it will inhibit the growth of the nanocrystals, so that we could obtain stable nanocrystals with different sizes. By analyzing the absorption and excitation spectra of the nanocrystals with different sizes, it was found that their absorption and excitation peaks underwent red-shift while the size of the nanocrystals increased, which may be due to the change of the interactions between perylene molecules. Also with increasing crystal size, the excimer emission of perylene nanocrystals was weakened and the decay time of the excimer was prolonged.

0035925080	Size effects on the optical properties of organic nanoparticles	Nanoparticles of 1-phenyl-3-((dimethylamino)styryl)-5-((dimethylamino)phenyl)-2-pyrazoline (PDDP) ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers were prepared by using the reprecipitation method. Their excitonic transitions responsible for absorption and emission, as compared with those of dilute solution, have been investigated as a function of nanoparticle size. We found that PDDP nanoparticles possess a special size dependence in their optical properties. We identified an extended charge-transfer (CT) state stemming from PDDP molecules closely stacking in nanoparticles and observed its shift to the high-energy side with decreasing nanoparticle size due to exciton confinement. At the same time, the molecular π-π* absorption of the nanoparticles was also blue-shifted, accompanied by an almost unchanging n-π* absorption as a result of the reduced overlap of the pyrazoline ring π orbital and decreased intermolecular interactions. Moreover, S1 and CT states were in equilibrium in the nanoparticles, and the probability of fluorescence from S1 increased with decreasing nanoparticle size.

0035930877	Superlattices of silver nanoparticles passivated by mercaptan	Two- and three-dimensional superlattices of passivated silver nanoparticles were formed on amorphous carbon films by the self-assembly technique. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results demonstrated that the colloid system was composed of silver nanoparticles and, on the surface of the silver nanoparticles, the chemical bond was formed between the S of the 1-nonanethiol and the Ag of the particle. XRD and transmission electron microscopy also showed that the instability of the silver nanoparticles mainly resulted from the growth of the nanoparticles. Due to the relatively close-packed thiol layer on the surface of the nanoparticle, in the infrared spectra of the silver nanoparticles, absorption peaks of the terminal methyl group and methylene stretching modes were red shifted; meanwhile the transverse modes of the binding absorption disappeared.

80053259850	Synthesis, crystal structure, and different local conformations of pyridine-imide oligomers	In this article, we report a new approach toward synthesis of pyridine-imide oligomers (PIOs). Using this approach, both dimer and trimer were one-pot synthesized from acylation of monomeric monoamide with monomeric dichloride. The yield of trimer was dependent on the alkoxyl terminals: it was 30% for methoyl group, whereas it was 95% for 3-chloro-1-propoxyl terminal. Acylation of dimeric monoamide with monomeric dichloride produced trimer, tetramer, and pentamer in a yield of 34%, 33%, and 28%, respectively. The synthesis was proposed to be mediated through an exchange between pyridine-2-carboxamide and pyridine-2-carbonyl chloride, both forming intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen-bonds between pyridine-nitrogen and pyridine-2-amide hydrogen atoms. Crystal structure from three trimers with different terminal groups was reported. Analysis on the crystal structures revealed that these three trimers had different local conformations. The different local conformations were originated from the structural tunability of the imide unit in either the coplanarity or bond parameters. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Polyoxometalates (POMs) were used to serve as both reducing and bridging molecules, which avoids the step of introducing other organic toxic molecules. Characterization using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, etc. was performed and the structure of the prepared nanohybrid of Ag NPs@POM-CNTs was verified. The nanohybrid showed a high electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction because of the synergistic effect of Ag NPs and CNTs. The POM is removable in the nanohybrid without affecting the catalytic activities. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84856525743	Probing the conformational transition of 2,2′-bipyridyl under external field by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy	Investigations on conformational transition of a small organic molecule are important to understand the conformation principles in chemistry and biology. We employed a low-temperature surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (LT-SERS) technique to probe the conformational changes of 2,2′-bipyridyl (22BPY) on Ag nanoparticles at the presence of external fields. An electrochemical system was used to provide an electrostatic field, and a special magnet was designed to supply a magneto-static field. High-quality and distinguishable SERS spectra of 22BPY were obtained at the different environments, which show fingerprint labels for correlative conformations of the 22BPY. The conformational transition of 22BPY is implemented via its adsorption on the Ag nanoparticles by triggers of the external electric field and magnetic field. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84860755733	Spin-orbit coupling and outer-core correlation effects in Ir- and Pt-catalyzed C-H activation	The transition metal-dependent spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and outer-core (5s5p) correlation effects in Ir- and Pt-catalyzed C-H activation processes are studied here using high level ab initio computations. The catalysts involve complexes with oxidation states: Ir(I), Ir(III), Pt(0), and Pt(II). It is demonstrated that for these heavy 5d transition metal-containing systems, the SOC effect and outer-core correlation effect on C-H activation are up to the order of ∼1 kcal/mol, and should be included if chemical accuracy is aimed. The interesting trends in our studied systems are: (1) the SOC effect consistently increases the C-H activation barriers and is apparently larger in higher oxidation states (Pt(II) and Ir(III)) than in low-oxidation states (Pt(0) and Ir(I)); and (2) the magnitude of outer-core (5s5p) correlation effects is larger in less coordinate-saturated system. The effect of basis set on the outer-core correlation correction is significant; larger basis sets tend to increase the C-H activation barriers. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

The bubble-assisted Ostwald ripening is proposed for the formation of these novel structures. Uniqueness of DEHs morphology led to greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity and photodetector performance.

84863970489	One-pot size and interior-cavity controlled synthesis of ZnO hollow micro-/nano-structured spheres	In this work, ZnO hollow micro-/nano-structured microspheres were prepared via a one-pot solution route. The size and interior-cavity of these microspheres could be easily controlled by varying the precursor concentration. The hollow spherical assemblies were composed of short rod-like building units at low precursor concentration. When the precursor concentration increased, onedimensional (1D) "pearl-chain-like" building units formed firstly and then self organized into hollow microspheres. The organization process and ripening of "pearl-chain-like" building units could be modulated by simply altering the reaction time. When tested in photocatalytic experiments, the hollow microspheres composed of loosely packed 1D "pearl-chain- like" building units showed higher activity than the densely packed ones. This method is very simple, mild, and may provide a new strategy to synthesize hierarchical self-assembled hollow structures. Copyright © 2012 American Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.

84865204714	Nano- and microstructured gold tubes for surface-enhanced Raman scattering by vapor-induced strain of thin films	We have demonstrated a new fabrication methodology for gold nano- and microtubes with regular cylinders by vapor-induced strain of porous thin films, which exhibit highly sensitive SERS signals for Rhodamine 6G detection. The strain originates from the temperature difference in the top and bottom of the gold film, which is brought about by the vapor of the Se powder, because Selenium has a low melting point. Around its melting point, Se appears in the vapor state, while the gold nanofilms remain in the solid phase. By exploiting such vapor-driven self-rolling of the gold film, shrinkage or collapse of the tube wall by capillary forces can be effectively avoided. Moreover, the diameter and the length of the obtained gold tubes can be well controlled by changing the Se powder evaporation temperature and the thickness of the gold film. The wall number of the tubes varied with the evaporation time and speed of the Se powder. Attributed to the larger surface area of the porous structures, the tubes exhibit SERS signals nearly 20 times larger than those of the gold film. This means that the detection limit of gold film is enhanced by over one order of magnitude. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84866046483	Alkali metal cations control over nucleophilic substitutions on aromatic fused pyrimidine-2,4-[1H,3H]-diones: Towards new PNA monomers	In this paper we report synthesis of a series of aromatic fused pyrimidine-2,4(3H)-dione-1-yl acetic acid and new PNA monomers containing these polycyclic nucleobase analogues. Introduction of a fused aromatic ring onto the 5,6-positions of the pyrimidine-2,4-[1H,3H]-diones brings about the steric effects and the charge delocalization, both weakening the nucleophilic substitutions on the 1- and 3-positions. We found that alkali metal cations play an important role in this alkylation reaction. LiOH brings out a much more efficient alkylation than NaOH does, while KOH nearly does not work on this reaction. Such influences from the alkali metal cations are probably due to that the charge-pairing interactions between the pyrimidine-2,4-dioxide anions and the alkali metal cations rearrange the charge distribution around the whole aromatic system and increase the negative charge distribution on the 1- and 3-nitrogen atoms, which then strengthens the nucleophilic reactivity on these positions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84866155946	Which density functional is the best in computing C-H activation energies by pincer complexes of late platinum group metals?	Using the recently proposed corrective LCCSD(T) method as a reference, we systematically assess the widely used approximate density functionals to reproduce C-H bond activation barriers by pincer complexes of the late platinum group transition metals (TMs) (TM = Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt). The pincer ligands explored here cover a wide range of PNP, PCP, POCOP, NCN, and SCS types. Interestingly, B3LYP is found to be the most accurate functional, followed by several others previously identified as well-performing functionals, like B2GP-PLYP, B2-PLYP, and PBE0. However, all tested functionals were found to exhibit the following uniform trends: (1) the DFT barriers for reactions of group 9 TM (Rh and Ir) pincer complexes show higher accuracy compared with those for group 10 TM (Pd and Pt) reactions; (2) within the same group, 5d TM pincer complexes have higher accuracy than 4d TM ones. Consequently, the barriers for C-H activation by Pd(II) pincer complexes were found to be the least accurate among the four TMs in almost all functionals tested here. The DFT empirical dispersion correction (DFT-D3) is shown to have a very small effect on barrier height. This study has some implications for other Σ-bond activations like H-H, C-C, and C-halogen bonds by late platinum group pincer complexes. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84866168922	How accurate can a local coupled cluster approach be in computing the activation energies of late-transition-metal-catalyzed reactions with Au, Pt, and Ir?	To improve the accuracy of local coupled cluster (LCC) methods in computing activation energies, we propose herein a new computational scheme. Its applications to various types of late-transition-metal-catalyzed reactions involving Au, Pt, and Ir indicate that the new corrective approach for LCC methods can downsize the mean unsigned deviation and maximum deviation, from the CCSD(T)/CBS reference, to about 0.3 and 0.9 kcal/mol. Using this method, we also calibrated the performance of popular density functionals, with respect to the same test set of reactions. It is concluded that the best functional is the general-purpose double hybrid functional B2GP-PLYP. Other well-performing functionals include the "kinetic" functionals M06-2X and BMK, which have a large percentage of HF exchange, and general-purpose functionals like PBE0 and wB97X. Comparatively, general-purpose functionals like PBE0 and TPSSh perform much better than the tested "kinetic" functionals for Pt-/Ir-catalyzed reactions, while the opposite is true for Au-catalyzed reactions. In contrast, wB97X performs more uniformly in these two classes of reactions. These findings hint that even within the scope of late transition metals, different types of reactions may require different types of optimal DFT methods. Empirical dispersion correction of DFT was found to have a small or no effect on the studied reactions barriers. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84865787516	Effects of structure-manipulated molecular stacking on solid-state optical properties and device performances	Four conjugated copolymers with phthalimide (PhI) or thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole- 4,6-dione (TPD) as the acceptor, thiophene (T) or selenophene (Se) as the spacer and 3,3′-didodecyl-2,2′-bithiophene (BT) as the common donor, namely, PPhI-T, PPhI-Se, PTPD-T and PTPD-Se, have been synthesized and the effects of intra- and intermolecular interactions on the optical properties, molecular stacking, and organic electronic device performances were investigated. The intramolecular S(Se)⋯O (carbonyl) interactions between the spacer and the PhI's or TPD's carbonyl and the intermolecular reciprocity between the polymeric backbones differ from each other as the spacer and the acceptor were varied. Among the four polymers, PPhI-T with the weakest intramolecular S⋯O interaction and intermolecular backbone reciprocity exhibited the poorest photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 0.31%. When the T spacer was replaced by the more polarized Se spacer, the resultant copolymer PPhI-Se exhibited stronger intra- and intermolecular interactions, resulting in better optical properties with a PCE of 0.94% when blended with PC71BM. When PhI is replaced with the more polarized TPD unit, the TPD-based polymers, PTPD-T and PTPD-Se, showed even better coplanarity compared to that of the PhI-based polymers, with a PCE of 2.04% for PTPD-T and 1.52% for PTPD-Se blended with PC71BM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study on the influences of structure-manipulated molecular stacking on solid-state optical properties and electronic device performance through modulations of the intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TEM images showed that PW12 particles with average diameter of tens of nanometer were finely dispersed in the film. FT-IR results suggested that the Keggin geometry of PW12 was still preserved inside the matrix and a charge-transfer bridge was built between PW12 and PAM through hydrogen bonds. Under UV irradiation, PW12 was reduced photochemically to yield various mixed-valency colored species ("heteropoly blues" or "heteropoly browns"). The extent of photoreduction was concerned with the concentration of PW12 and irradiation time. The presence and diffusion of oxygen played an important role in reversibility of photochromism. © 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Moreover, it was found that the as-prepared rutile powder samples exhibited a regular polyhedron shape and small grain size distribution.

IR spectra showed that the Keggin geometry of polyoxometalates was still preserved inside the composite film and strong Coulombic interaction was built between heteropolyoxometalates and polyacrylamide via hydrogen bond. It was found that the thermal stability of the hybrid film was lower than that of pure polymer but the film was stable enough for photochromic application from the TG-DTA curves.

0038337791	Ultrasound-induced change of microstructure and photochromic properties of polyacrylamide thin films containing a polyoxometalate	Novel photochromic nanocomposite thin films were prepared by entrapping polyoxometalate in a polyacrylamide matrix via the ultrasound technique. The ultrasound irradiation has a great effect on the microstructure and photochromic properties of the hybrid films. The polyoxometalate nanoparticles are finely dispersed in the polymer matrix after ultrasound treatment, instead of agglomeration in the unirradiated film with ultrasound. Consequently, the photochromic behaviors of the hybrid films can be controlled from irreversible heteropolybrown to reversible heteropolyblue by ultrasound. The influence of ultrasound on microstructure and photochromic properties is due to the sonochemical controlling interfacial interactions in the hybrid system.

0037871596	Size-tunable emission from 1,3-diphenyl-5-(2-anthryl)-2-pyrazoline nanoparticles	Organic nanoparticles of 1,3-diphenyl-5-(2-anthryl)-2- pyrazoline (DAP) ranging in average diameters from 40 to 160 nm were prepared through the reprecipitation method. The average diameters of the particles were controlled by variation of the aging time. We found that DAP nanoparticles exhibit the size-dependent optical properties. The absorption transitions of the nanoparticles at the lower-energy side experience a bathochromic shift with an increase in the particle size as a result of the increased intermolecular interactions, while the higher-energy bands of anthracene split possibly due to the electronic coupling between the pyrazoline ring of one molecule and the anthracene moiety of the neighboring molecule. Most interestingly, the nanoparticle emission in the blue light region from pyrazoline chromophore shifts to shorter wavelengths with an increase in the particle size, accompanied with a relatively gradual dominance of the emission at about 540 nm from an exciplex between the pyrazoline ring of one molecule and the anthracene moiety of the neighboring molecule. The hypsochromic shift in the emission of DAP nanoparticles was identified as originating from the pronounced decrease in the Stokes shift due to the restraint of vibronic relaxation and the configuration reorganization induced by the increased intermolecular interaction.

84867514574	Intermolecular electron transfer promoted by directional donor-acceptor attractions in self-assembled diketopyrrolopyrrole-thiophene films	The photophysics of a symmetric triad consisting of two bithiophene (BT) units covalently linked to a central diketopyrrolopyrrole unit (DPP) has been investigated both in dichloromethane and in the thin film. The DPP-BT film exhibits a red-shifted low-energy absorption band compared to its solution, which is indicative of efficient π-π interactions in the solid-state phase. The steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence results revealed that the photoluminescence was subjected to severe emission quenching when DPP-BT changes from its solution phase to its film form. Further femtosecond transient absorption studies clarified that rapid intermolecular electron transfer accounts for the considerable fluorescence quenching event. The structural characterization of DPP-BT nanobelts, based on GIXRD and SAED patterns, suggested that the composite may be self-assembled into a slipped face-to-face configuration in the film, providing compact interlayer D-A interactions. As a result, intermolecular electron transfer is promoted by the favorable donor-acceptor attractions between the adjacent molecules. Moreover, this packing configuration provides a moderate channel for charge transportation. The hole mobility, which was measured based on a single-belt field-effect transistor, was found to be around 0.07 cm

84875985318	Are DFT methods accurate in mononuclear ruthenium-catalyzed water oxidation? An ab initio assessment	Mononuclear Ru-based water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) are an important class of WOCs for water splitting. In this work, through high-level coupled cluster calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS), we have examined a variety of density functionals for their performances in the whole catalytic cycle of water oxidation catalyzed by mononuclear Ru-based WOCs. The tested functionals cover a wide range from pure GGA and meta-GGA to hybrids and double hybrids (TPSS, OLYP, BP86, M06-L, B3LYP, PBE0, M06, M06-2X, TPSSh, CAM-B3LYP, wB97X, B2-PLYP, B2GP-PLYP). Depending on different reaction types and species in the catalytic cycle, the performances of different DFTs vary severely, whose trends are summarized in the paper. Our results indicate that using a single approximate functional to accurately model all reactions involved in the whole Ru-based WOC catalytic cycle is still a very challenging task. In the current status, PBE0 and M06 may be recommended for the whole catalytic cycle. Generally, this study provides a guide for selecting an appropriate DFT method in modeling each of the various steps in water oxidation catalyzed by Ru-based WOCs. The sensitivity of DFT and ab initio results upon the degree of basis set completeness found in this work is also worthy of attention in the future theoretical study of mononuclear Ru-based WOCs. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

Decreasing the number of thiophene linkers from m = 2 to 1 lowers both LUMO and HOMO energy levels.

However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of covalent star-shaped TPA-DPP derivatives is still very low. To design star-shaped TPA-DPP derivatives with better photovoltaic performance, we embedded a thiophene ring in between the TPA and DPP units, namely TPA-T-DPP, and reported the comparative studies of the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of TPA-DPP and TPA-T-DPP. Benefiting from the covalent thiophene bridges, compared to the TPA-DPP solid film, the TPA-T-DPP film showed enhanced light-harvesting ability, for instance, an improved absorptivity (Abs. = 1.72/100 nm vs. 1.23/100 nm), a broader absorption band (131 nm vs. 107 nm) and a narrower band gap (1.86 eV vs. 1.91 eV), from cyclic voltammetry. Studies on the photovoltaic properties revealed that the best TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM based device showed a dramatically enhanced PCE of 2.95%, increased by 2.14 times with respect to the efficiency of the best TPA-DPP based device (1.38%). The improvement of PCE also was observed in the small molecule:PC61BM based devices (1.81% vs. 1.13%). Test of the hole mobilites of the active layer provided further insight into the impact of the embedded thiophene units. The hole mobility of the TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM blended films was higher by about one order of magnitude (1.16 × 10<sup>-2</sup> cm <sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) than that of the TPA-DPP:PC71BM blended films (3.85 × 10<sup>-3</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s <sup>-1</sup>). These results clearly indicated that embedding the thiophene ring enlarged the conjugation, thus enhanced the light-harvesting ability and hole mobility, while further significantly improving the device performance. Additionally, TPA-T-DPP was also used as the electron-acceptor material, and the best P3HT:TPA-T-DPP based device exhibited a very high open-circuit voltage (1.14 V), which was among the highest values reported for single-layered OSC devices. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84880142761	Recent advances in organic one-dimensional composite materials: Design, construction, and photonic elements for information processing	Many recent activities in the use of one-dimensional nanostructures as photonic elements for optical information processing are explained by huge advantages that photonic circuits possess over traditional silicon-based electronic ones in bandwidth, heat dissipation, and resistance to electromagnetic wave interference. Organic materials are a promising candidate to support these optical-related applications, as they combine the properties of plastics with broad spectral tunability, high optical cross-section, easy fabrication, as well as low cost. Their outstanding compatibility allows organic composite structures which are made of two or more kinds of materials combined together, showing great superiority to single-component materials due to the introduced interactions among multiple constituents, such as energy transfer, electron transfer, exciton coupling, etc. The easy processability of organic 1D crystalline heterostructures enables a fine topological control of both composition and geometry, which offsets the intrinsic deficiencies of individual material. At the same time, the strong exciton-photon coupling and exciton-exciton interaction impart the excellent confinement of photons in organic microstructures, thus light can be manipulated according to our intention to realize specific functions. These collective properties indicate a potential utility of organic heterogeneous material for miniaturized photonic circuitry. Herein, focus is given on recent advances of 1D organic crystalline heterostructures, with special emphasis on the novel design, controllable construction, diverse performance, as well as wide applications in isolated photonic elements for integration. It is proposed that the highly coupled, hybrid optical networks would be an important material basis towards the creation of on-chip optical information processing. Organic 1D crystalline composites, with the ability to tailor the componential regime and structural geometry, represent a landmark achievement in materials science. Centered on the collective properties that originate from the individual composition and their interactions in heterogeneous structures, this report illustrates organic material as an emerging basis of multi-functional photonic devices toward next generation optical information processing.

84881222613	Benzodithiophene bridged dimeric perylene diimide amphiphiles as efficient solution-processed non-fullerene small molecules	Two amphiphilic and highly twisting perylene diimide (PDI) dimers, Bis-PDI-BDT-EG, were synthesized by using 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl) benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T) and 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy) BDT (BDT-O) as covalent bridges at the 7,7′-positions, while at the 1,1′-positions, they were functionalized with weakly solvophobic 2-methoxylethoxyl (EG) units. The subtle structural differences between BDT-O and BDT-T lead to distinct aggregation abilities: with respect to the over-strong aggregation ability of the BDT-O bridged dimer 2, the BDT-T bridged dimer 1 shows largely reduced aggregation ability and is solution-processable in the commonly used organic solvent. The highly twisted conformation between the PDI-BDT-PDI planes produced steric-pairing effects, which directed ordered packing of dimer 1.

84882244735	Synthesis and applications of organic nanorods, nanowires and nanotubes	One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, including nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, etc., exhibit the quantum confinement effects in the other two dimensions. Nanomaterials with 1D coherence are more suitable for the construction of active nanodevices and interconnects rather than zero-dimensional (0D) amorphous nanoparticles. Inorganic 1D nanomaterials have been widely investigated and widely used as building blocks in many kinds of optoelectronic integrations, and it is very reasonable to assume that their organic counterparts can also play an important role in this field. During the past ten years, organic 1D nanomaterials constructed from small functional molecules have obtained more and more attention due to their unique optical and electronic properties as well as their potential applications in nanoscale devices. Their high structural tunability, reaction activity and processability provide great opportunities to miniaturized optoelectronic chips based on organic 1D nanostructures, since they are usually assembled from molecular units with weak intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking and van der Waals force. These weak interactions allow for more facile and mild conditions in the fabrication of high quality organic 1D nanostructures rather than those in the construction of their inorganic counterparts. More importantly, very recent studies reveal that the diversity of energy/electron transfer processes in organic semiconductors brings new hopes to break the performance limitations of traditional photonic and electronic devices, thus allowing higher luminescence intensity, more efficient photon confinement, stronger exciton-photon coupling, and so on. Indeed, organic 1D nanomaterials have already emerged to play increasingly an important role in many optoelectronic applications, such as nanolasers, optical waveguides, light-emitting devices, solar cells and sensors. In the past two decades, people have not only witnessed but also taken for granted the rapid development of nanomaterial science, and here we would like to promote awareness of the significance of organic 1D nanomaterials in the field of nanotechnology and optoelectronic nanodevices. This report presents a comprehensive review about recent research in the preparation and applications of 1D nanomaterials from functional low-molecular-weight organic compounds, whose optical and electronic properties are fundamentally different from those of their inorganic counterparts. Here we try to summarize the important breakthroughs from the fabrication of organic nanorods, nanowires and nanotubes, to the application of these nanostructures in integrated photonic elements and optoelectronic nanodevices. We begin with a general summary of the construction strategies (liquid-phase assembly, vapor deposition and template methods) for achieving 1D nanostructures from small organic functional molecules, then provide an overview of the unique optoelectronic properties induced by molecular aggregation in the nanostructures. Special emphasis is put on the luminescent properties of low dimensional sizes that are different from those of the corresponding bulk materials. This offers the materials better photon confinement ability or charge carrier transport property, and hence better optoelectronic performances such as optical waveguiding, multicolor emission, low-threshold nanolasers, light-emitting devices, photon-detecting devices, etc., which are presented one by one in the following section. In the last part of this report, we conclude with our personal viewpoints of the future development of organic 1D nanomaterials and also their great potentials in highly integrated photonic and electronic devices and chips. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The luminescence quantum efficiency of TPP nanocrystals increases from 24.2% for the nanocrystals with an average size of 300 nm to 34.6% for those with an average size of 20 nm. Surface capping by polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) will improve the quantum efficiency of TPP nanocrystals. The size-dependence and capping-induced variation of the luminescence quantum efficiency was elucidated in viewpoint of aggregation quenching and the equilibrium between the TPP monomers and the aggregates in TPP nanocrystals.

84892526344	A new solution-processed diketopyrrolopyrrole donor for non-fullerene small-molecule solar cells	In solution-processed non-fullerene small-molecule solar cells (NF-SMSCs), the bulk-heterojunction active layer is blended by a small molecule donor and a non-fullerene small molecule acceptor. Synthesis of solution-processed small molecule donors is of the same importance as designing non-fullerene small molecule acceptors. In this paper, a new solution-processed diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based small molecule donor, namely DPP-BDT-T, was synthesized. The pure DPP-BDT-T film covers a broad spectrum from 500 nm to 700 nm with a low band gap of 1.72 eV. By choosing our newly reported perylene diimide (PDI) dimer, bis-PDI-T-EG, as the non-fullerene small molecule acceptor, the best NF-SMSC device showed a low efficiency of 0.12%. When using 2% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive, more acceptor molecules formed into π-π-stacks, accompanied by the increase of the phase size from 15 nm to 50 nm and the formation of continuous interpenetrating networks.

84893481615	Electropolymerized films as a molecular platform for volatile memory devices with two near-infrared outputs and long retention time	Surface-confined molecular logic gates have great potential as memory devices. We present in this article the uses of electropolymerized films as a molecular platform for volatile memory devices. A vinyl-substituted cyclometalated ruthenium-amine hybridized compound has been polymerized by reductive electropolymerization. The resulting polymeric films display two well-defined redox processes at +0.32 and +0.68 V vs. Ag/AgCl, leading to three well-separated redox states. Characterizations of these films by XPS and TEM techniques are presented. The singly- and doubly-oxidized states of the film possess intense absorption at 1070 and 700 nm, respectively. These polymeric films exhibit promising three-stage near-infrared electrochromism and the best contrast ratios (ΔT%) of 52% at 1070 nm and 76% at 700 nm have been achieved. The colors of the film at three redox stages are purple, brown, and sky blue, respectively. The electrochromism is featured by a long retention time at all three stages (infinity at -0.20 V, 4 h at +0.55 V, and 30 min at +1.05 V, respectively). The singly- and doubly-oxidized states of a film about 10 nm thick have been used to build a surface-confined Set/Reset flip-flop memory with two electrochemical inputs and two near-infrared optical outputs. By using another intermediate state between the singly- and doubly-oxidized states a multi-valued logic system has been demonstrated. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014.

84894175670	Epitaxial self-assembly of binary molecular components into branched nanowire heterostructures for photonic applications	We report a sequential epitaxial growth to prepare organic branched nanowire heterostructures (BNwHs) consisting of a microribbon trunk of 1,4-dimethoxy-2,5-di[4′-(cyano)styryl]benzene (COPV) with multiple nanowire branches of 2,4,5-triphenylimidazole (TPI) in a one-pot solution synthesis. The synthesis involves a seeded-growth process, where COPV microribbons are grown first as a trunk followed by a seeded-growth of TPI nanowire branches at the pregrown trunk surfaces. Selected area electron diffraction characterizations reveal that multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions between TPI and COPV components play an essential role in the epitaxial growth as a result of the structural matching between COPV and TPI crystals. A multichannel optical router was successfully realized on the basis of the passive waveguides of COPV green photoluminescence (PL) along TPI nanowire branches in a single organic BNwH. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

Two distinct types of LDSCs with controllable dimensions were obtained by altering the polarity of anti-solvents and the concentration of supramolecular monomers. Each type of LDSCs exhibited its characteristic SHG response to the polarized incident signals, which is attributed to the inherent crystal structures.

84900405801	Perylene-diimide based non-fullerene solar cells with 4.34% efficiency through engineering surface donor/acceptor compositions	Although solvent additive has been observed to positively effect the nanomorphology and, in turn, the electric performance of organic small molecule acceptor based cells, how they act on the donor/acceptor (D/A) compositions throughout the active layer and, consequently, on the electron and hole injection/extraction property is still largely unknown yet. Herein, we use a D/A combination of PBDTTT-C-T (polymer donor) and a perylene diimide (PDI) dimer (small molecule acceptor) and find that the additive of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) effectively controls the surface D/A compositions. As pointed out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments, the air surface of the active layer is donor-rich and the buried surface is acceptor-rich, while there is a homogeneous distribution of D/A composition across the active layer between the air and the buried surfaces. The donor abundance, i.e., D/A weight ratio, in the acceptor-rich buried surface plays a crucial role in tuning the injection property of selective carrier from the buried contact - as the donor abundance is increased from 0.3 ([DIO] ≤ 5%) to 0.7-0.84 ([DIO] > 5%), the favorable carrier injection from the bottom contact is switched from electrons to holes, as revealed by the hole-only and electron-only volt-ampere characteristics. Through tuning the surface D/A compositions and along with modulating the phase separation and phase size, a best efficiency of 4.34% is obtained from an inverted cell when using a low [DIO] of 2%, while a best efficiency of 3.28% is achieved from a conventional cell structure when using a high [DIO] of 7%. The results presented herein clearly demonstrate that a small change in the surface D/A compositions of the active layer may give a significant difference in the device performance of PDI based nonfullerene cells. The tuning of the D/A compositions in the buried surface is primarily explained by the different boiling points of DIO and main processing solvent, different solubility of the donor and acceptor in DIO, and different wettability of the donor-DIO and acceptor-DIO solutions on the PEDOT:PSS or ZnO substrates. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

The electrocatalytic performance of the novel polydopamine carbide decorated platinum-carbon catalyst is characterized by voltammogram. Origin of improvement in its performance is analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope. It is exhibited that the catalytic activity and durability for oxygen reduction reaction and methanol tolerance of the polydopamine carbide decorated platinum-carbon catalyst are enhanced.

Three effects, namely, cis-effect, net charge effect, and steric hindrance effect, are identified, which can exert sizable modulation on the O-O formation barriers for the two widely accepted O-O formation mechanisms of WNA (water nucleophilic attack) and I2M (direct coupling of two high-valent metal oxo units).

84908066768	Impact of intermolecular distance on singlet fission in a series of TIPS pentacene compounds	Singlet fission has attracted considerable interest for its potential application in organic photovoltaics. However, the underlying microscopic mechanism is not well understood and the molecular parameters that govern SF efficiency remain unclear. We herein study the primary exciton photogeneration and evolution in the thin film of a series of pentacene derivatives (TIPS-Pn and ADPD-Pn) using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. With a favorable "long-edge on" packing motif, the singlet-excited slip-stacked TIPS-Pn and ADPD-Pn molecules undergo ultrafast fission to produce triplet excitonic states with time constants of ∼0.3 ps. More importantly, the ADPD-Pn compound features a considerably higher triplet yield than TIPS-Pn (162 ± 10% vs 114 ± 15%). The enhanced electronic coupling as a result of closer interchromophore distance (3.33 Å for ADPD-Pn vs 3.40 Å for TIPS-Pn) is suggested to account for the much higher triplet yield for ADPD-Pn relative to that for TIPS-Pn, proving SF can be readily modulated by adjusting the intermolecular distance.

84918562433	From molecular design and materials construction to organic nanophotonic devices	CONSPECTUS: Nanophotonics has recently received broad research interest, since it may provide an alternative opportunity to overcome the fundamental limitations in electronic circuits. Diverse optical materials down to the wavelength scale are required to develop nanophotonic devices, including functional components for light emission, transmission, and detection. During the past decade, the chemists have made their own contributions to this interdisciplinary field, especially from the controlled fabrication of nanophotonic molecules and materials. In this context, organic micro- or nanocrystals have been developed as a very promising kind of building block in the construction of novel units for integrated nanophotonics, mainly due to the great versatility in organic molecular structures and their flexibility for the subsequent processing. Following the pioneering works on organic nanolasers and optical waveguides, the organic nanophotonic materials and devices have attracted increasing interest and developed rapidly during the past few years. In this Account, we review our research on the photonic performance of molecular micro- or nanostructures and the latest breakthroughs toward organic nanophotonic devices. Overall, the versatile features of organic materials are highlighted, because they brings tunable optical properties based on molecular design, size-dependent light confinement in low-dimensional structures, and various device geometries for nanophotonic integration. The molecular diversity enables abundant optical transitions in conjugated π-electron systems, and thus brings specific photonic functions into molecular aggregates. The morphology of these micro- or nanostructures can be further controlled based on the weak intermolecular interactions during molecular assembly process, making the aggregates show photon confinement or light guiding properties as nanophotonic materials. By adoption of some active processes in the composite of two or more materials, such as energy transfer, charge separation, and exciton-plasmon coupling, a series of novel nanophotonic devices could be achieved for light signal manipulation. First, we provide an overview of the research evolution of organic nanophotonics, which arises from attempts to explore the photonic potentials of low-dimensional structures assembled from organic molecules. Then, recent advances in this field are described from the viewpoints of molecules, materials, and devices. Many kinds of optofunctional molecules are designed and synthesized according to the demands in high luminescence yield, nonlinear optical response, and other optical properties. Due to the weak interactions between these molecules, numerous micro- or nanostructures could be prepared via self-assembly or vapor-deposition, bringing the capabilities of light transport and confinement at the wavelength scale. The above advantages provide great possibilities in the fabrication of organic nanophotonic devices, by rationally combining these functional components to manipulate light signals. Finally, we present our views on the current challenges as well as the future development of organic nanophotonic materials and devices. This Account gives a comprehensive understanding of organic nanophotonics, including the design and fabrication of organic micro- or nanocrystals with specific photonic properties and their promising applications in functional nanophotonic components and integrated circuits.

This material was constructed from highly ordered hexagonal array of 1, 10-diaminodecane and decatungstate polyanions. HR-TEM image showed that the decatungstate polyanions "packed" around the 1, 10-diaminodecane molecules. XRD pattern confirmed its hexagonal array (a = b = 1.718 nm, c unknown). A template mechanism was proposed to explain its formation process. It is evidenced that 1, 10-diaminodecane molecules play a crucial role in templating the inorganic framework. The cationic diaminodecane molecules "bond" decatungstate polyanions on each end via supermolecular interaction and thus form bolarform structure units. These units pack together and a hexagonal phase is constructed.

The photovoltaic response of the two samples showed opposite dependence on external electric field. And when electric field was applied, the thresholds of photovoltaic response of the two samples were all red-shifted. The results showed that the surface properties of P1 were different from those of P2, because of their different preparation process. We assigned that basic zinc acetate structure exist on the surface of P1 sample. While for P2 sample prepared by aging P1, that kind of surface structure disappeared, but the particles might be doped with lithium ions in the aging process.

The particles prepared were characterized by UV-Vis absorption spectra, IR spectra, XRD, TGA, DTA, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), surface photovoltage spectra (SPS) and electrical field induced surface photovoltage spectra (EFISPS) etc.. IR study showed that acetic acid molecules coordinated to the surface of ZnO in two modes, one is of the bridging type, and the other of the unidentate type. The latter is weaker. It was indicated by EFISPS that the two kinds of particles have very different surface properties because of their different sizes and preparation processes. We found that basic zinc acetate structure exists on the surface of 3 nm particles. While for 5 nm particles prepared by aging the 3 nm particles, that surface structure disappeared, but the particles were doped with lithium ions in the aging process. The above phenomena were explained by considering the hydrolytic chemistry of zinc acetate.

Compared with the absorption spectrum of perylene acetone solution, a new J-aggregate absorption peak appeared in the absorption spectra of nanocrystals. With the decrease of perylene nanocrystals' size, it shows a blue-shift in the absorption spectra. This blue-shift is due to the size-dependent property. The perylene concentration of initial acetone solution or the amount of solution injected into water, the aging time of organic nanocrystal dispersion and the adding of surfactant were the influencing factors of nanocrystal growth. We can gain the required microcrystals of different sizes by controlling the conditions of growth.
