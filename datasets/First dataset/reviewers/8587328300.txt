22044440418	Human blood analysis by IR and Raman spectroscopy	Both Raman and infrared spectrum measure vibrational transitions in molecules, so they can detect structure and clinical medical character of material in molecule level. Since human blood keeps in close touch with tissue, it may have some symptoms in the blood when functional disorder happens. For this reason, people have already developed a lot of methods to investigate the feasibility of using it to diagnose and therapy, especially in the orientation of non-invasive measurement. In this paper the principles of two kinds of spectra were analyzed and discussed first, involving the advantages and disadvantages in actual research. Then, according to different composition and research direction of human blood, we introduced the research progress of this field at present. Finally the difficulty we met and the expectation in the future are discussed.

34247366797	The impact of blood content on skin spectra	Based on the analysis of skin morphological structure, the mechanism of cutaneous fluorescence emission and diffuse reflectance formation, a six-layer skin optical model was developed, allowing the variation of blood content in both the upper blood plexus and the deep blood plexus. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to examine the effect of varying tissue blood contents on skin fluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectra. The results demonstrated that (1) Both fluorescence and reflectance spectrum can reflect changes of blood content in skin tissue; (2) The impact of blood content in the upper blood plexus on skin spectra intensity is far larger than that in the deep blood plexus, though there is far less blood in the upper blood plexus; (3) Fluorescence and reflectance spectrum could be used to detect or analyze changes of blood content in skin tissue, especially for treatment monitoring and for evaluating the severity of skin diseases that involving the blood plexus or blood pathological changes in the upper dermis.

84907997435	Potential of non-invasive esophagus cancer detection based on urine surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy	Non-invasive esophagus cancer detection based on urine surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis was presented. Urine SERS spectra were measured on esophagus cancer patients (n = 56) and healthy volunteers (n = 36) for control analysis. Tentative assignments of the urine SERS spectra indicated some interesting esophagus cancer-specific biomolecular changes, including a decrease in the relative content of urea and an increase in the percentage of uric acid in the urine of esophagus cancer patients compared to that of healthy subjects. Principal component analysis (PCA) combined with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was employed to analyze and differentiate the SERS spectra between normal and esophagus cancer urine. The diagnostic algorithms utilizing a multivariate analysis method achieved a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.3% and specificity of 83.3% for separating esophagus cancer samples from normal urine samples. These results from the explorative work suggested that silver nano particle-based urine SERS analysis coupled with PCA-LDA multivariate analysis has potential for non-invasive detection of esophagus cancer.

84925389690	Label-free detection of serum proteins using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for colorectal cancer screening	Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra of serum proteins purified from human serum samples were employed to detect colorectal cancer. Acetic acid as a new aggregating agent was introduced to increase the magnitude of the SERS enhancement. High-quality SERS spectra of serum proteins were acquired from 103 cancer patients and 103 healthy volunteers. Tentative assignments of SERS bands reflect that some specific biomolecular contents and protein secondary structures change with colorectal cancer progression. Principal component analysis combined with linear discriminant analysis was used to assess the capability of this approach for identifying colorectal cancer, yielding diagnostic accuracies of 100% (sensitivity: 100%; specificity: 100%) based on albumin SERS spectroscopy and 99.5% (sensitivity: 100%; specificity: 99%) based on globulin SERS spectroscopy, respectively. A partial least squares (PLS) approach was introduced to develop diagnostic models. An albumin PLS model successfully predicted the unidentified subjects with a diagnostic accuracy of 93.5% (sensitivity: 95.6%; specificity: 91.3%) and the globulin PLS model gave a diagnostic accuracy of 93.5% (sensitivity: 91.3%; specificity: 95.6%). These results suggest that serum protein SERS spectroscopy can be a sensitive and clinically powerful means for colorectal cancer detection. © 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

43249090872	Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of urine by an ingenious near-infrared Raman spectrometer	This paper demonstrates the potential of an elaborately devised near-infrared Raman system in analysis of urine. The broad band in the long-wavelength region of the electronic absorption spectra of the sol with added adsorbent at certain concentrations has been explained in terms of the aggregation of the colloidal silver particles. We have reported the surface-enhanced Raman (SERS) spectra of urine, and studied the silver solution enhanced effects on the urine Raman scattering. The Raman bands of human's urine was assigned to certain molecule vibrations. We have found that different donators have dissimilar SERS of urine in different physiological condition. Comparatively few studies have explored the ability of Raman spectroscopy for the analysis of urine acid. In the present report, we investigated the ability of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy to measure uric acid in the human urine. The results suggested that the present Raman system holds considerable promise for practical use. Practical applications such as the quantitative medical examination of urine metabolites may also be feasible in the near future.

43249096538	Preliminary study on Raman spectra of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in vitro	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the malignant tumors threatening people's health and life which is mostly found in South China; early diagnosis is crucial to improve the effective treatment and higher survival rates. In this work, preliminary study on Raman spectra of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in vitro is reported. Spectra were obtained from normal and cancerous nasopharyngeal tissue which had undergone biopsy for high risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Factors effecting Raman spectra were also studied including sample storage time, spectral accumulation time. The results show that sample storage time has a negative effect on the measurement while increasing accumulation time does not appear to improve the spectra quality significantly. Consistent spectral differences appear to exist between normal and cancerous tissues, mainly in several bands. The results demonstrate Raman spectroscopy has the potential ability to detect and diagnose cancerous tissues. Future studies will advance toward true in vivo, real time and non-invasively.

50949114712	A gray-natural logarithm ratio neighborhood filters method for biomedical image denoising	Denoising biomedical images can be completed by a spatial averaging of nearby pixels. Neighborhood filters are usually preferred. In this paper, we perform an analysis of neighborhood filters where the size of the gray Euclidean distance is small. We prove that the weak edges and details are smoothed and the gray level transition tends to become mild filtering with these neighborhood filters. As a solution, we propose a gray-natural logarithm ratio bilateral neighborhood filter. The new gray-natural logarithm ratio Bilateral neighborhood filter method can not only well restrain noise but also keep much more weak edges and details of a biomedical image, and preserve the original gray level transition of gray level images. Experimental results show that the effectiveness for biomedical image denoising with our method is better. © 2008 IEEE.

57849135427	Lateral shifts of an optical beam in an anisotropic metamaterial slab	The lateral shift of a light beam at the surface of an anisotropic metamaterial slab is investigated. Analytical expressions of the lateral shifts are derived using the stationary-phase method, in the case that total reflection does and does not occur at the first interface. The sign of the lateral shift in two situations is discussed, and the necessary conditions for the lateral shift to be positive or negative are given. It is shown that the thickness and physical parameters of the anisotropic metamaterial slab, as well as the incident angle of the light beam, strongly affect the properties of the lateral shift, and numerical results validate these conclusions. The effect of a lossy metamaterial on the lateral shift is also investigated. A restriction on the thickness of the slab is obtained, which is necessary for the stationary-phase method to remain valid. © 2008 Springer.

65149103305	Measurement of nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissue ex vivo by Raman spectroscopy	Raman spectroscopy has shown its potential and advantages in detecting molecular changes associated with tissue pathology, which makes it possible to diagnose with optical methods non-invasively and real-time. A compact and rapid near-infrared (NIR) Raman system was developed using 785 nm diode laser, volume phase technology (VPT) holographic grating system and NIR intensified charge-coupled device (CCD) with a specially designed Raman fibre probe which can effectively reduce the interference of fluorescence and Rayleigh scattering, maximize the ability of Raman collection as well as correct the image aberration of a planar grating diffraction. Adopting this method, signal-to-noise ratio has been greatly improved and human tissue signals can be acquired in a short time. Raman signals from fat and musculature of fresh pork were measured and referenced for further optimization, then Raman spectra of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in vitro and the effect of storage time on them were measured in 1-5 s and discussed. The sensitivities and performance of the system will be further enhanced and more Raman data will be acquired and compared between normal and cancerous nasopharyngeal tissue, expecting to discover the statistical characteristics, which will benefit the diagnosis and treatment of early nasopharyngeal carcinoma or other tumors.

69949158886	Rapid delivery of silver nanoparticles into living cells by electroporation for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy	In current intracellular surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements, gold or silver nanoparticles are delivered into living cells by "passive uptake". This procedure is time-consuming, could take up to several to twenties hours of incubation with nanoparticles in the culture medium. It is a less optimal method for certain applications such as high-throughput disease screening. Here, we present a method based on electroporation for fast delivery of silver nanoparticles into living cells for intracellular SERS spectroscopy. This new method for nanoparticle delivery averts the shortcoming of "passive uptake" and allows for quick acquisition of robust SERS spectra from living C666, A431, and CA46 cancer cell lines in our study. Our study also shows that the silver nanoparticles are localized only in the cell cytoplasm for electroporation delivery, while for "passive uptake", the nanoparticles have gone beyond the cytoplasm and into the nucleus. However, the whole-cell detection SERS spectra using electroporation delivery are more reproducible than for "passive uptake", thus are favored for practical applications. As a result, the process of SERS detection is accelerated significantly and the data reproducibility is improved as well, demonstrating great potential for biomedical applications, such as for high-throughput cancer cell screening. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We have studied their chloride ion effects on the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activities of the silver solution. For the positive charge dyes, no SERS could be observed without the addition of chloride ions for lack of the electrostatic interaction. The chloride ions served to enlarge silver particles and to contribute the existence of the surface active sites, making the silver solution SERS active to the dye samples. With the change of the DCM concentration, the SERS of DCM show significant change in their features, indicating different orientation changes of the molecule on the colloidal silver surface with DCM concentration. The broad long-wavelength band in the absorption spectra of the silver sol with added DCM at certain concentrations has been explained in terms of the aggregation of the colloidal silver particles. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Silver nanoparticles (Ag NP) as the SERS-active nanostructures were directly mixed with blood plasma to enhance the Raman scattering signals of various biomolecular constituents such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. High quality SERS spectrum from blood plasma-Ag NP mixture can be obtained within 10. s using a Renishaw micro-Raman system. SERS measurements were performed on two groups of blood plasma samples: one group from patients (n= 43) with pathologically confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinomas (WHO type I, II, and III) and the other group from healthy volunteers (control subjects, n= 33). Tentative assignments of the Raman bands in the measured SERS spectra suggest interesting cancer specific biomolecular differences, including an increase in the relative amounts of nucleic acid, collagen, phospholipids and phenylalanine and a decrease in the percentage of amino acids and saccharide contents in the blood plasma of nasopharyngeal cancer patients as compared to that of healthy subjects.

Recently, methods for early diagnosis of NPC has become one of the most important research topics in medical field. Early monitoring of morphological change of NPC cells during the carcinogenesis is of great importance, and early information extracted from the NPC cells during the initial stage of NPC is critical for diagnosis and treatment.

Without loss of generality, we assume that the anisotropic metamaterials have an arbitrary angle between the optical axis and the interface, and then we derive the characteristic equations and the analytical expression of energy flux of this waveguides. It is found that the enhancement factor increases rapidly at first with increasing of the thickness of the metamaterials in the case when the optical axis is parallel to or normal to the interface, namely the angle is equal to 0 or π/2. The enhancement factor eventually reaches its maximum when complete surface polaritons are established at the boundary between the metamaterials and the cladding [D.-K. Qing, G. Chen, Appl. Phy.

In this paper, we report our experimental work to optimize the electroporation parameters, including adjustment of the pulse pattern, operation temperature, and electroporation buffer, for fastest delivery of silver nanoparticles into living C666 cells (a human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line).

Our work concluded that the silver nanoparticle delivery rate is best under the electroporation condition of using 4 consecutive 350 V (875 V/cm) rectangular electric pulses of 1, 10, 10 and 1 ms durations, respectively. Low temperature (0-4°C) is necessary for keeping cell viability during the electroporation process and it also improves the delivery efficiency of silver nanoparticles.

79951723951	Gastric cancer detection based on blood plasma surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy excited by polarized laser light	We have recently applied surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for blood plasma analysis for non-invasive nasopharyngeal cancer detection and obtained good preliminary results. The aim of this study was to develop a more robust SERS spectroscopy based blood plasma analysis method for non-invasive gastric cancer detection. The effect of different laser polarizations (non-polarized, linear-polarized, right-handed circularly polarized, and left-handed circularly polarized) on blood plasma SERS spectroscopy was explored for the first time. Silver nanoparticles as the SERS-substrate were directly mixed with blood plasma to enhance the Raman scattering of various biomolecular constituents. High quality SERS spectra were obtained using a fiber optic probe and a dispersive type near infrared Raman system. Blood plasma samples from gastric cancer patients (n= 32) and healthy subjects (n= 33) were analyzed. The diagnostic performance for differentiating gastric cancer plasma from normal plasma was evaluated. Principal component analysis combined with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of the obtained spectral data was used to develop diagnostic algorithms. Classification results obtained from cross-validation of the LDA model based on the four spectral data sets of different laser polarizations demonstrated different diagnostic sensitivities and specificities: 71.9% and 72.7% for non-polarized laser excitation, 75% and 87.9% for linear-polarized laser excitation, 81.3% and 78.8% for right-handed circularly polarized laser excitation, 100% and 97% for left-handed circularly polarized laser excitation.

SERS spectra, the integrated SERS intensity and the reproducibility of spectrum were compared in 6 electroporation experiments of the same electric pulse parameters but different concentration of silver colloid. The silver nanoparticle concentration is best under the condition of 500 ?l electroporation buffer containing 50 ?l silver colloid using 875 V/cm, 1 ms rectangular electric pulses for electroporation twice. Increasing the concentration of silver nanoparticle could improve the SERS intensity while decrease the reproducibility of the spectrum. Moreover, the observed SERS bands of living C666 cell were tentatively assigned. This work is promising for the practical application of SERS technology, such as real time detection and analysis of the biochemical substance in living cells.

Firstly, Raman active molecule 4-MBA is adsorbed on Ag shell Au core bimetallic NPs, and then the SERS-tagged nanoprobes are modified with CEA monoclonal antibody, forming CEA-SERS probes. Finally, according to the theory of specific binding of SERS-tagged antibody and the corresponding antigen, SERS spectra and imaging are performed in tissue sections after dropping the SERS-tagged immuno-nanoprobes. Data show that colon cancer epithelium appears strong SERS signals, while stroma and normal epithelium do not appear SERS signals, except a few non-specific adsorption signals. As can be clearly seen from the SERS images, the colon cancer epithelium highly expresses CEA, while stroma and normal epithelium do not. In conclusion, due to high sensitivity and high specificity of SERS-tagged immuno-nanoprobes, the SERS labeled immunoassay technology is promising for the analysis of the protein expression in colon cancer tissue sections and has the potential to be developed into a significant aiding tool for pathological diagnosis of colon cancer.

84860246454	Diagnostic potential for gold nanoparticle-based surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to provide colorectal cancer screening using blood serum sample	Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a vibrational spectroscopic technique that is capable of probing the biomolecular changes associated with diseased transformation. The objective of our study was to explore gold nanoparticle based SERS to obtain blood serum biochemical information for non-invasive colorectal cancer detection. SERS measurements were performed on two groups of blood serum samples: one group from patients (n = 38) with pathologically confirmed colorectal cancer and the other group from healthy volunteers (control subjects, n = 45). Tentative assignments of the Raman bands in the measured SERS spectra suggested interesting cancer specific biomolecular changes, including an increase in the relative amounts of nucleic acid, a decrease in the percentage of saccharide and proteins contents in the blood serum of colorectal cancer patients as compared to that of healthy subjects. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the measured SERS spectra separated the spectral features of the two groups into two distinct clusters with little overlaps. Linear discriminate analysis (LDA) based on the PCA generated features differentiated the nasopharyngeal cancer SERS spectra from normal SERS spectra with high sensitivity (97.4%) and specificity (100%). The results from this exploratory study demonstrated that gold nanoparticle based SERS serum analysis combined with PCA-LDA has tremendous potential for the non-invasive detection of colorectal cancers. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

84860250413	Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of creatinine in silver colloid	Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technology has already made great progress in bio-molecule detection. It can make the target molecules strongly absorbed onto the surface of metal nanoparticles, and then the Raman signal of its own has been greatly enhanced through physical and chemical enhancement mechanisms. We report the SERS spectra of creatinine in silver colloid, and study the silver colloid enhanced effects on the Raman scattering of creatinine. We can also find that creatinine concentration is linearly related to its SERS peak intensity and the detection limit of creatinine silver sol is found to be 10 mg/dl. In conclusion, we can observe that the silver colloid has very good enhanced effects for the creatinine. The potential applications of SERS in quantitative measurement of the creatinine liquor are demonstrated. The result shows that the SERS approach would provide a unique and fast test method for creatinine detection. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

84863052767	Immunoassay for LMP1 in nasopharyngeal tissue based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering	Background: Previous studies have shown that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is closely associated with the occurrence and development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and can be used as a tumor marker in screening for the disease. Here we report a new methodology based on highly specific and sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technology to detect LMP1 in nasopharyngeal tissue sections directly with no need of tedious procedures as with conventional immunohistochemistry methods. Methods: LMP1-functionalized 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA)-labeled Au/Ag core-shell bimetallic nanoparticles were prepared frst and then applied for analyzing LMP1 in formalin-fxed paraffn-embedded nasopharyngeal tissue sections obtained from 34 cancer patients and 20 healthy controls. SERS spectra were acquired from a 25 × 25 spot square area on each tissue section and used to generate SERS images. Results: Data from SERS spectra and images show that this new SERS-based immunoassay detected LMP1 in formalin-fixed paraffn-embedded nasopharyngeal tissue sections with high sensitivity and specificity. The results from the new LMP1-SERS probe method are superior to those of conventional immunohistochemistry staining for LMP1, and in excellent agreement with those of in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER). Conclusion: This new SERS technique has the potential to be developed into a new clinical tool for detection and differential diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma as well as for predicting metastasis and immune-targeted treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. © 2012 Chen et al.

84863151781	Electrical pulse - mediated enhanced delivery of silver nanoparticles into living suspension cells for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy	Electrical pulse-mediated enhanced silver nanoparticles delivery is a much better method for intracellular surfaceenhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements of suspension cells. Robust and high-quality SERS spectra of living suspension cells were obtained based on an electroporationSERS method, which can overcomes the shortcoming of nonuniform distribution of silver nanoparticles localized in the cell cytoplasm after electroporation and reduces the amount variance of silver nanoparticles delivered into different cells. The electroporation parameters include three 150 V (375 V/cm) electric pulses of 1, 5, and 5 ms durations respectively. Our results indicate that considerable amount of silver nanoparticles can be rapidly delivered into the human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells, and the satisfied SERS spectra were obtained while the viability of the treated cells was highly maintained (91.7%). The electroporation-SERS method offers great potential approach in delivering silver nanoparticles into living suspension cells, which is useful for widely biomedical applications including the real-time intracellular SERS analysis of living cells. © 2012 by Astro Ltd., published exclusively by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84867860990	Preliminary study on the surface enhanced Raman spectrum of tea	In the present paper, taking Tiegunyin tea as an example, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectrum of tea was obtained, the effects of different active substrates were explored from the aspects of enhanced factor, background noise, repeatability, and signal to noise ratio (SNR), while the impact of adsorption time on the measurement was also discussed. The results show that it is feasible to obtain the SERS spectrum of tea, and Raman signal of SERS spectrum was greatly enhanced compared with that of regular Raman spectrum. The active substrate of silver colloid prepared by the reduction of silver nitrate and trisodium citrate has a better enhanced effect, while different adsorption times have no direct influences on the SERS measurement. The method based on SERS firstly proposed in this paper may provide an alternative method for the discriminant analysis and quality identification of tea.

In this paper, we developed a surfaceenhanced Raman scattering (SERS), platform for detection and differentiation of serum RNAs of colorectal cancer. A novel three-dimensional (3-D), Ag nanofilm formed by dry MgSO4 aggregated silver nanoparticles, Ag NP, as the SERS-active substrate was presented to effectively enhance the RNA Raman signals. SERS measurements were performed on two groups of serum RNA samples. One group from patients, n 55 with pathologically diagnosed colorectal cancer and the other group from healthy controls, n 45. Tentative assignments of the Raman bands in the normalized SERS spectra demonstrated that there are differential expressions of cancer-related RNAs between the two groups. Linear discriminate analysis, based on principal component analysis, generated features can differentiate the colorectal cancer SERS spectra from normal SERS spectra with sensitivity of 89.1 percent and specificity of 95.6 percent. This exploratory study demonstrated great potential for developing serum RNA SERS analysis into a useful clinical tool for label-free, noninvasive screening and detection of colorectal cancers. © 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

The effect of different laser polarizations (nonpolarized, linear-polarized, right-handed circularly polarized, and left-handed circularly polarized) on seminal plasma SERS spectroscopy was explored for the first time. The diagnostic performance in differentiating abnormal seminal plasma (n = 37) from normal seminal plasma (n = 24) was evaluated. A combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was employed to develop diagnostic algorithms. Classification results of different laser polarizations demonstrated different diagnostic sensitivities and specificities, among which, left-handed circularly polarized laser excitation showed the best diagnostic result (95.8% sensitivity and 64.9% specificity). Our exploratory study demonstrated that SERS spectroscopy with left-handed circularly polarized laser excitation has the potential for becoming a new diagnostic method in semen-quality assessment. © 2012 Chen et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84880271076	Microwave synthesis of Au nanoparticles as promising SERS substrates	A novel method for rapidly synthesized Au colloidal under microwave irradiation was present in this paper. Size of the Au nanoparticles varied from 10 nm to 60 nm along with varying mol fractions by chloroauric acid solution reduced with sodium citrate. The prepared Au nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer. It is found that the nanoparticle size and shape are highly dependent on the reaction time and the molar ratios of the reducing agent. By the SERS measurements of R6G, 4-MBA and Crystal violet, this Au colloid is shown to be an excellent SERS substrate with good stability. As the fabrication process of this SERS substrate is simple and inexpensive, this method may be used in large-scale preparation of substrates that can serve as an ideal SERS substrate in biomedical application. © 2012 SPIE.

We demonstrated that Raman spectra obtained from the droplet edge presented useful and characteristic signatures for protein and amino acids assessment. Using a different analytical method, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis, we further confirmed that Na, K, and Cl were mainly detected in the central area of the dry ECM droplet while sulphur, an indicative of the presence of macromolecules such as proteins, was mainly found at the periphery of the droplet. In addition, to reduce sample preparation time, different temperatures for drying the droplets were tested. The results showed that drying temperature at 50°C can effectively reduce the sample preparation time to 6 min (as compared to 50 min for drying at room temperature, ~25°C) without inducing thermal damage to the proteins. This work demonstrated that DCDR has potential for rapid and reliable metabolomic profiling of ECM in clinical applications. © 2013 The Authors.
