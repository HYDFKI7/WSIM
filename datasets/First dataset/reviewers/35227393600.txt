84927712228	Measurement of the W boson polarization in top decay at CDF at √s = 1.8 TeV	The polarization of the W boson in t →Wb decay is unambiguously predicted by the standard model of electroweak interactions and is a powerful test of our understanding of the tbW vertex. We measure this polarization from the invariant mass of the b quark from t → Wb and the lepton from W → lν whose momenta measure the W decay angle and direction of motion, respectively. In this paper we present a measurement of the decay rate (f <inf>V</inf>+A) of the W produced from the decay of the top quark in the hypothesis of V + A structure of the tWb vertex. We find no evidence for the nonstandard V + A vertex and set a limit on f<inf>V+A</inf> < 0.80 at 95% confidence level. By combining this result with a complementary observable in the same data, we assign a limit on f<inf>v+A</inf> < 0.61 at 95% CL. This corresponds to a constraint on the right-handed helicity component of the W polarization of f<inf>+</inf> < 0.18 at 95% CL. This limit is the first significant direct constraint on f<inf>V+A</inf> in top decay. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

These data, of integrated luminosity 86 pb <sup>-1</sup>, were recorded by the CDF Experiment for pp collisions at √s = 1.8 TeV This study tests a model of higher order QCD processes that result in gluon emission and may give some indication of the magnitude of the contribution of processes higher than NLO.

From 311pb-1 of data collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab, we measure a production cross section of 5.8±1.2(stat)-0.7+0.9(syst)pb for a top quark mass of 178GeV/c2, in agreement with previous determinations and standard model predictions. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33745080312	Measurement of the top quark mass using template methods on dilepton events in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We describe a measurement of the top quark mass from events produced in pp̄ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV, using the Collider Detector at Fermilab. We identify tt̄ candidates where both W bosons from the top quarks decay into leptons (eν, μν, or τν) from a data sample of 360pb-1. The top quark mass is reconstructed in each event separately by three different methods, which draw upon simulated distributions of the neutrino pseudorapidity, tt̄ longitudinal momentum, or neutrino azimuthal angle in order to extract probability distributions for the top quark mass. For each method, representative mass distributions, or templates, are constructed from simulated samples of signal and background events, and parametrized to form continuous probability density functions. A likelihood fit incorporating these parametrized templates is then performed on the data sample masses in order to derive a final top quark mass. Combining the three template methods, taking into account correlations in their statistical and systematic uncertainties, results in a top quark mass measurement of 170.1±6.0(stat.)±4.1(syst.) GeV/c2. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646409558	Search for scalar bottom quarks from gluino decays in p̄p collisions at s=1.96TeV	We searched for scalar bottom quarks in 156pb-1 of p̄p collisions at s=1.96TeV recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab II experiment at the Tevatron. Scalar bottom quarks can be produced from gluino decays in R-parity conserving models of supersymmetry when the mass of the gluino exceeds that of the scalar bottom quark. Then, a scalar bottom quark can decay into a bottom quark and a neutralino. To search for this scenario, we investigated events with large missing transverse energy and at least three jets, two or more of which were identified as containing a secondary vertex from the hadronization of b quarks. We found four candidate events, where 2.6±0.7 are expected from standard model processes, and placed 95% confidence level lower limits on gluino and scalar bottom quark masses of up to 280 and 240GeV/c2, respectively. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646492293	Measurement of the top quark mass with the dynamical likelihood method using lepton plus jets events with b-tags in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	This paper describes a measurement of the top quark mass, Mtop, with the dynamical likelihood method (DLM) using the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. The Tevatron produces top/antitop (tt̄) pairs in pp̄ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The data sample used in this analysis was accumulated from March 2002 through August 2004, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 318pb-1. We use the tt̄ candidates in the "lepton+jets" decay channel, requiring at least one jet identified as a b quark by finding a displaced secondary vertex. The DLM defines a likelihood for each event based on the differential cross section as a function of Mtop per unit phase space volume of the final partons, multiplied by the transfer functions from jet to parton energies. The method takes into account all possible jet combinations in an event, and the likelihood is multiplied event by event to derive the top quark mass by the maximum likelihood method. Using 63 tt̄ candidates observed in the data, with 9.2 events expected from background, we measure the top quark mass to be 173.2+2.6-2.4(stat.)±3. 2(syst.)GeV/c2, or 173.2+4.1-4.0GeV/c2. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Using a data sample representing 344pb-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab II experiment, we compare standard model predictions with the number of observed events for invariant masses between 50 and 800GeV/c2.

To identify the Z′→e+e- signal, both the dielectron invariant mass distribution and the angular distribution of the electron pair are used.

Z bosons are identified in their electron and muon decay modes, and b jets with ET>20GeV and |η|<1.5 are identified by reconstructing a secondary decay vertex. The measurement is based on an integrated luminosity of about 330pb-1. A cross section times branching ratio of σ(Z+bjets)×B(Z→ℓ+ℓ-)=0.93±0.36pb is found, where B(Z→ℓ+ℓ-) is the branching ratio of the Z boson or γ* into a single flavor dilepton pair (e or μ) in the mass range between 66 and 116GeV/c2. The ratio of b jets to the total number of jets of any flavor in the Z sample, within the same kinematic range as the b jets, is 2.36±0.92%. Here, the uncertainties are the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties. Predictions made with next-to-leading order QCD agree, within experimental and theoretical uncertainties, with these measurements. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The likelihood in top quark mass is calculated for each event by convoluting the leading order matrix element describing qq̄→tt̄→blνlb̄l′νl′ with detector resolution functions. The presence of background events in the data sample is modeled using similar calculations involving the matrix elements for major background processes. In a data sample with integrated luminosity of 340pb-1, we observe 33 candidate events and measure Mtop=165.2±6.1(stat.) ±3.4(syst.)GeV/c2.

The sample contains signals of 3600 fully reconstructed hadronic Bs decays and 37000 partially reconstructed semileptonic Bs decays. We measure the probability as a function of proper decay time that the Bs decays with the same, or opposite, flavor as the flavor at production, and we find a signal consistent with Bs0-B̄s0 oscillations. The probability that random fluctuations could produce a comparable signal is 0.2%. Under the hypothesis that the signal is due to Bs0-B̄s0 oscillations, we measure Δms=17.31-0.18+0.33(stat)±0. 07(syst)ps-1 and determine |Vtd/Vts|=0.208-0.002+0.001(expt)-0.006+0.008(theor). © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33749159214	Measurements of bottom-antibottom azimuthal production correlations in proton-antiproton collisions at s=1.8TeV	We have measured the azimuthal angular correlation of bb̄ production, using 86.5pb-1 of data collected by Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) in pp̄ collisions at s=1.8TeV during 1994-1995. In high-energy pp̄ collisions, such as at the Tevatron, bb̄ production can be schematically categorized into three mechanisms. The leading-order (LO) process is "flavor creation," where both b and b̄ quarks substantially participate in the hard scattering and result in a distinct back-to-back signal in final state. The "flavor excitation" and the "gluon splitting" processes, which appear at next-leading-order (NLO), are known to make a comparable contribution to total bb̄ cross section, while providing very different opening angle distributions from the LO process. An azimuthal opening angle between bottom and antibottom, Δ, has been used for the correlation measurement to probe the interaction creating bb̄ pairs. The Δ distribution has been obtained from two different methods. One method measures the Δ between bottom hadrons using events with two reconstructed secondary vertex tags. The other method uses bb̄→(J/ ψX)(X′) events, where the charged lepton () is an electron (e) or a muon (μ), to measure Δ between bottom quarks. The bb̄ purity is determined as a function of Δ by fitting the decay length of the J/ψ and the impact parameter of the. Both methods quantify the contribution from higher-order production mechanisms by the fraction of the bb̄ pairs produced in the same azimuthal hemisphere, ftoward. The measured ftoward values are consistent with both parton shower Monte Carlo and NLO QCD predictions. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

33750051602	Measurement of the tt̄ production cross section in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV using lepton+jets events with jet probability b-tagging	We present a measurement of the tt̄ production cross section using events with one charged lepton and jets from pp̄ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. A b-tagging algorithm based on the probability of displaced tracks coming from the event interaction vertex is applied to identify b quarks from top decay. Using 318pb-1 of data collected with the CDF II detector, we measure the tt̄ production cross section in events with at least one restrictive (tight) b-tagged jet and obtain 8.9-1.0+1.0(stat)-1.0+1.1(syst)pb. The cross section value assumes a top quark mass of mt=178GeV/c2 in the acceptance corrections. The dependence of the cross section on mt is presented in the paper. This result is consistent with other CDF measurements of the tt̄ cross section using different samples and analysis techniques, and has similar systematic uncertainties. We have also performed consistency checks by using the b-tagging probability function to vary the signal-to-background ratio and also using events that have at least two b-tagged jets. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33244465223	Top quark mass measurement using the template method in the lepton+jets channel at CDF II	This article presents a measurement of the top quark mass using the CDF II detector at Fermilab. Colliding beams of protons and antiprotons at Fermilab's Tevatron (s=1.96TeV) produce top/antitop pairs, which decay to W+W-bb̄; events are selected where one W decays to hadrons and the other W decays to either e or μ plus a neutrino. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately 318pb-1. A total of 165 tt̄ events are separated into four subsamples based on jet transverse energy thresholds and the number of b jets identified by reconstructing a displaced vertex. In each event, the reconstructed top quark invariant mass is determined by minimizing a χ2 for the overconstrained kinematic system. At the same time, the mass of the hadronically decaying W boson is measured in the same event sample. The observed W boson mass provides an in situ improvement in the determination of the hadronic jet energy scale. A simultaneous likelihood fit of the reconstructed top quark masses and the W boson invariant masses in the data sample to distributions from simulated signal and background events gives a top quark mass of 173.5-3.8+3.9GeV/c2. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The latter case also encompasses exotic interpretations, such as a D0D̄*0 molecule. Only the S13 and J/ψρ hypotheses are compatible with our data. Since S13 is untenable on other grounds, decay via J/ψρ is favored, which implies C=+1 for the X(3872). Models for different J/ψ-ρ angular momenta L are considered.

80051551406	Underlying event in hard interactions at the Fermilab Tevatron p̄p collider	For comparison of inclusive jet cross sections measured at hadron-hadron colliders to next-to-leading order (NLO) parton-level calculations, the energy deposited in the jet cone by spectator parton interactions must first be subtracted. The assumption made at the Tevatron is that the spectator parton interaction energy is similar to the ambient level measured in minimum bias events. In this paper, we test this assumption by measuring the ambient charged track momentum in events containing large transverse energy jets at √s = 1800 GeV and √s = 630 GeV and comparing this ambient momentum with that observed both in minimum bias events and with that predicted by two Monte Carlo models. Two cones in η-φ space are defined, at the same pseudorapidity, η, as the jet with the highest transverse energy (E<inf>T</inf> <sup>(1)</sup>), and at ±90° in the azimuthal direction, φ. The total charged track momentum inside each of the two cones is measured. The minimum momentum in the two cones is almost independent of E<inf>T</inf> <sup>(1)</sup> and is similar to the momentum observed in minimum bias events, whereas the maximum momentum increases roughly linearly with the jet E <inf>T</inf><sup>(1)</sup> over most of the measured range. This study was carried out using data from the CDF detector taken during Run 1 (1994-1995). The study will help improve the precision of comparisons of jet cross section data and NLO perturbative QCD predictions. The distribution of the sum of the track momenta in the two cones is also examined for five different E<inf>T</inf> <sup>(1)</sup> bins. The HERWIG and PYTHIA Monte Carlo generators are reasonably successful in describing the data, but neither can describe completely all of the event properties.

80051551841	Direct photon cross section with conversions at CDF	We present a measurement of the isolated direct photon cross section in p p̄ collisions at √s = 1.8 TeV and |η| < 0.9 using data collected between 1994 and 1995 by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). The measurement is based on events where the photon converts into an electron-positron pair in the material of the inner detector, resulting in a two track event signature. To remove π<sup>0</sup> → γγ and η → γγ events from the data we use a new background subtraction technique which takes advantage of the tracking information available in a photon conversion event. We find that the shape of the cross section as a function of photon p<inf>T</inf> is poorly described by next-to-leading-order QCD predictions, but agrees with previous CDF measurements.

84875948962	Measurement of the J/ψ meson and b-hadron production cross sections in pp̄ collisions at √s = 1960 GeV	We present a new measurement of the inclusive and differential production cross sections of J/ψ mesons and b hadrons in proton-antiproton collisions at √s = 1960 GeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 39.7 pb<sup>-1</sup> collected by the CDF run II detector. We find the integrated cross section for inclusive J/ψ production for all transverse momenta from 0 to 20 GeV/c in the rapidity range |y| < 0.6 to be 4.08 ± 0.02(Stat)<inf>-0.33</inf><sup>+0.36</sup>(syst) μb. We separate the fraction of J/ψ events from the decay of the long-lived b hadrons using the lifetime distribution in all events with p<inf>T</inf>(J/ψ) > 1.25 GeV/c. We find the total cross section for b hadrons, including both hadrons and antihadrons, decaying to J/ψ with transverse momenta greater than 1.25 GeV/c in the rapidity range |y(J/ψ)| < 0.6 is 0.330 ± 0.005(stat) <inf>-0.033</inf><sup>+0.036</sup>(syst) μb. Using a Monte Carlo simulation of the decay kinematics of b hadrons to all final states containing a J/ψ, we extract the first measurement of the total single b-hadron cross section down to zero transverse momentum at √s = 1960 GeV. We find the total single b-hadron cross section integrated over all transverse momenta for b hadrons in the rapidity range |y| < 0.6 to be 17.6 ± 0.4(stat) <inf>-2.3</inf><sup>+2.5</sup>(syst) μb. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

0344718028	Determination of the absolute jet energy scale in the DO calorimeters	The DO detector is used to study pp collisions at the 1800 and 630 GeV center-of-mass energies available at the Fermilab Tevatron. To measure jets, the detector uses a sampling calorimeter composed of uranium and liquid argon as the passive and active media, respectively, Understanding the jet energy calibration is not only crucial for precision tests of QCD, but also for the measurement of particle masses and the determination of physics backgrounds associated with new phenomena. This paper describes the energy calibration of jets observed with the DO detector at the two pp center-of-mass energies in the transverse energy and pseudorapidity range E
