84942372481	Super-resolution fusion of complementary panoramic images based on cross-selection kernel regression interpolation	A complementary catadioptric imaging technique was proposed to solve the problem of low and nonuniform resolution in omnidirectional imaging. To enhance this research, our paper focuses on how to generate a high-resolution panoramic image from the captured omnidirectional image. To avoid the interference between the inner and outer images while fusing the two complementary views, a cross-selection kernel regression method is proposed. First, in view of the complementarity of sampling resolution in the tangential and radial directions between the inner and the outer images, respectively, the horizontal gradients in the expected panoramic image are estimated based on the scattered neighboring pixels mapped from the outer, while the vertical gradients are estimated using the inner image. Then, the size and shape of the regression kernel are adaptively steered based on the local gradients. Furthermore, the neighboring pixels in the next interpolation step of kernel regression are also selected based on the comparison between the horizontal and vertical gradients. In simulation and real-image experiments, the proposed method outperforms existing kernel regression methods and our previous wavelet-based fusion method in terms of both visual quality and objective evaluation.

0032292956	HVS: An image-based approach for constructing virtual environment	Virtual Reality Systems can construct virtual environment which provide an interactive walkthrough experience. Traditionally, walkthrough is performed by modeling and rendering 3D computer graphics in real-time. Despite the rapid advance of computer graphics technique, the rendering engine usually places a limit on scene complexity and rendering quality. This paper presents a approach which use the real-world image or synthesized image to compose a virtual environment. The real-world image or synthesized image can be recorded by camera, or synthesized by off-line multispectral image processing for Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) Imagery and SPOT HRV imagery. They are digitally warped on-the-fly to simulate walking forward/backward, to left/right and 360-degree watching around. We have developed a system HVS (Hyper Video System) based on these principles. HVS improves upon QuickTime VR and Surround Video in the walking forward/backward.

2442650181	An orientation update message filtering algorithm in collaborative virtual environments	Orientation update message filtering is an important issue in collaborative virtual environments (CVEs). Dead-reckoning (DR) is a known effective mechanism for update message filtering. Yet, previous dead-reckoning techniques mainly focus on the update message filtering for positions. The existing orientation dead-reckoning algorithms are based on fixed threshold values. The drawbacks of fixed thresholding for orientations (FTO) are discussed in this paper. We propose a variable thresholding for orientations (VTO) based on average recent angular velocity. The main advantage of the proposed VTO is the ability of balancing the number of state update messages and shift frequency of direction and speed of rotation.

In order to increase the running speed of color correction and reduce the out-of-gamut color pixels, we introduce the selection of principal regions. The average color values of principal regions are used to construct the low-degree (up to degree two) polynomial mapping functions from the source images to the corrected images. The functions are run in the decorrelated color spaces. Our method is tested using real and synthetic images.

84897562768	Context-aware and locality-constrained Coding for image categorization	Improving the coding strategy for BOF (Bag-of-Features) based feature design has drawn increasing attention in recent image categorization works. However, the ambiguity in coding procedure still impedes its further development. In this paper, we introduce a context-aware and locality-constrained Coding (CALC) approach with context information for describing objects in a discriminative way. It is generally achieved by learning a word-to-word cooccurrence prior to imposing context information over locality-constrained coding. Firstly, the local context of each category is evaluated by learning a word-to-word cooccurrence matrix representing the spatial distribution of local features in neighbor region. Then, the learned cooccurrence matrix is used for measuring the context distance between local features and code words. Finally, a coding strategy simultaneously considers locality in feature space and context space, while introducing the weight of feature is proposed. This novel coding strategy not only semantically preserves the information in coding, but also has the ability to alleviate the noise distortion of each class. Extensive experiments on several available datasets (Scene-15, Caltech101, and Caltech256) are conducted to validate the superiority of our algorithm by comparing it with baselines and recent published methods. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the performance of baselines and achieves comparable and even better performance with the state of the arts. © 2014 Wenhua Xiao et al.

84897971456	An application oriented and shape feature based multi-touch gesture description and recognition method	In order to customize multi-touch gestures for different applications, and facilitate multi-touch gesture recognition, an application oriented and shape feature based multi-touch gesture description and recognition method is proposed. In this method, multitouch gestures are classified into two categories, namely atomic gesture and combined gesture, where combined gesture is a combination of atomic gestures using temporal, spatial and logical relationships. For description, users' motions are mapped into gestures, and then semantic constraints of an application are extracted to build the accessible relationships between gestures and entity states. For recognition, trajectories of a gesture are projected onto an image, and the shape feature of every trajectory and relationships between each other are extracted to match with gesture templates. Experiments show that this method is independent to multi-touch platforms, robust to manipulating differences of users, and it is scalable and reusable for users and applications. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

47649104447	Fast panorama unrolling of catadioptric omni-directional images for cooperative robot vision system	For omni-directional imaging based cooperative robot vision system, panorama unrolling is an important problem. We present an eight direction symmetry reuse algorithm for this problem, principles of this algorithm are: 1) Treat the original image to be unrolled as a series of co-centric circles, and uniformly partition them into eight parts of symmetrical sector regions. 2) According to symmetry principle in spatial geometry, we construct the symmetrical transform relations pixel coordinates among these regions. So, we need compute only one region of pixel coordinate for panorama unrolling, by use of complex ray-trace coordinate mapping, while the other seven parts of regions can be determined by symmetrically reusing results from the first region, which reduces seven-eighths computational burden for ray-tracing method. Experiments indicate that, under the same precision, our algorithm improves 3.28 times of unrolling speed compared with ray-trace unrolling method. In omni-directional video with look-up table method, the idea of eight direction symmetry reuse can also be used to reduce the look-up table size to only one-eighth of the original table. ©2007 IEEE.

The computations of DCT and quantization can be remarkably reduced if zero quantized DCT coefficients are detected prior to DCT and quantization. Many methods have been applied to early detect most zero quantized DCT coefficients. But the detection ratios of zero quantized DCT coefficients need to be improved when quantization parameter (QP) is small. We present an adaptive method to detect zero quantized DCT coefficients. When QP exceeds a certain value, a new threshold is derived to efficiently detect the all-zero blocks (AZBs) without any video degradation. Otherwise, a concept of fourteen-zeros block (FZB), which means only two coefficients are non-zero in 16 DCT coefficients of a 4 × 4 block, is proposed. An innovative method to process FZBs is proposed to reduce the redundant computations. Experimental results show that the proposed adaptive method achieves approximately 8%-20% computational savings, compared with that of the existing methods. © 2009 IEEE.

Decompose the new images to 9 harmonic images' linear combination. By changing the 9 coefficients the new images under different illumination condition can be generated. All of these new images under different pose and different illumination condition make up the train set of individual face hmm.

70350597568	A gradient-domain method to blend multiple images for aerial video mosaic	Image blending is a crucial process to achieve quality composite picture making in video mosaic. The method of guided interpolation by a guidance vector works well for blending two images with a relative small overlapping region in image mosaic. However, it is hard to apply the method to video mosaic, due to the large overlapping region shared by every two consecutive frames and the complex overlapping conditions among multiple frames. To deal with this problem, a framework to synchronously blend multiple images in the gradient-domain is proposed in this article: first, the mosaic plane is partitioned into several regions by the boundaries of each image; then, the guidance vector and boundary conditions are defined for each region; finally, the blending process is carried out for every region synchronously. To avoid over partition of the mosaic plane, a frame selecting scheme and a region combining algorithm are proposed. Applying the proposed framework to video mosaic achieves a fine composite picture with less consumptive computation.

77956163258	A multi-touch platform based on four corner cameras and methods for accurately locating contact points	This paper presents a low-cost and scalable multi-touch platform which uses four cameras to reduce occlusion. Three methods are provided for locating contact points on this platform, including the lookup table, vanishing point, and 3D reconstruction. With each of these methods, respectively, the contact point is located using the projection center and the reference point, the projection center and the vanishing point, and the back-projected rays of epipolar geometry. If the four directing lines of a contact point intersect, the contact point is considered to be real; if the lines do not intersect, the point is rejected. Experimental results indicate that all three methods are capable of locating contact points even under conditions of occlusion. The lookup table and vanishing point methods are, respectively, best suited to small and large platforms, while the accuracy of 3D reconstruction method has been found to be sensitive to the physical setup. The approach proposed here can be directly installed on existing display platforms and thus should be of practical applicability in the near future. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

77958454953	Linear programming approach to matrix games with payoffs of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets	The definition of a matrix game with payoffs of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIF-sets) and the concept of its solutions are given.

An urban 3D reconstruction oriented stereo parallel mosaics (SPM) generation algorithm with a multi-perspective mosaic containing texture and depth information is proposed. Firstly, we detect and parameterize the planes in images from the depth information under the principle of preserving maximum side faces of building. Secondly, we choose the key images according to the positions and plane parameters. Thirdly, we stitch and merge the key images to a seamless SPM by using double optimal partitions and Poisson equations. The experiments show that SPM presents good performance of 3D reconstruction and 2D presentation for urban scenes.

78649433636	Generalised Gaussian distribution to early detect zero quantised discrete cosine transform coefficients in H.264/AVC video encoding	In H.264/AVC video encoding, zero quantised discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients blocks, called ZQBs, are quite common in low bit-rate video applications. The computations of DCT and quantisation can be remarkably reduced if ZQBs are detected prior to DCT and quantisation. A mathematical model is established based on analysing DCT coefficient distribution and applying the generalised Gaussian distribution theorem. Using this model, four conditions corresponding to four kinds of transform and quantisation methods are proposed. As compared with other methods in the literature, the proposed method is able to detect more ZQBs and hence reduce more computations. Experimental results show our method is superior to other methods in terms of the total number of reduced computations and usability. © 2010 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

78649584258	A 2-point algorithm for 3D reconstruction of horizontal lines from a single omni-directional image	Reconstruction of 3D scenes with abundant straight line features has many applications in computer vision and robot navigation. Most approaches to this problem involve stereo techniques, in which a solution to the correspondence problem between at least two different images is required. In contrast, 3D reconstruction of straight horizontal lines from a single 2D omni-directional image is studied in this paper. The authors show that, for symmetric non-central catadioptric systems, a 3D horizontal line can be estimated using only two points extracted from a single image of the line. One of the two points is the symmetry point of the image curve of horizontal line, and the other is a generic point on the image curve. This paper improves on several prior works, including horizontal line detection in omni-directional image and line reconstruction from four viewing rays, but is simpler than those methods while being more robust. We evaluate how the precision of feature point extraction can affect line reconstruction accuracy, and discuss preliminary experimental results. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

78649986918	A complete-view stereo imaging method for three-dimensional reconstruction of objects	This paper designs a configuration of a coaxial complete-view stereo imaging system based on single camera and cylinder-conical mirror for three-dimensional reconstruction of objects. We also introduce a projective mapping algorithm between the object-points and the image-points of complete-view image. The circinal stereo image pairs that have complete-view information can be gained through two reflections of the cylinder-conical mirror. In the circinal stereo image pairs, there is a correlation between object-points and image-points that corresponds to the restriction of epipolar line. On the basis of projection, stereo image-points matching is done, so the three-dimensional coordinate values of relevant object-points can be gained according to the coordinate positions of image-points. Finally, after the simulated experiment based on the 3DS MAX virtual equipment, we implement objects' three-dimensional reconstruction and its complete-view browsing, which demonstrates the validity of the algorithm.

79952725131	Design analysis of a complementary double-mirror catadioptric omnidirectional imaging system	To solve the problems of low and non-uniform resolution in catadioptric omnidirectional imaging, a novel omnidirectional sensor of complementary imaging structure is designed, by using two reflecting mirrors. Each spatial object has two imaging positions, respectively in the inner and the outer ring of captured omnidirectional images. The uniformity of resolution distribution is obviously improved due to complementary double imaging, and higher spatial resolution is achieved by limiting the vertical field of vision in a narrow range for some specific applications, such as military remote surveillance. Computational methods of the shape parameters and sizes of two mirrors are described in detail, and the mapping relations between omnidirectional image plane and cylindrical panoramic space are accurately derived based on ray tracing. Experimental results show that remarkable complementarities exist between the inner and outer ring of omnidirectional images, and detailed analysis of resolution distribution is presented. Moreover, sub-pixel sampling displacement between two image positions provides essential preconditions and foundations for further research on super-resolution reconstruction of cylindrical panoramic space.

79952615124	Fast semi-global stereo matching via extracting disparity candidates from region boundaries	This study proposes a novel fast stereo matching algorithm via semi-global energy optimisation, which achieves a considerable improvement in efficiency for just a small price in accuracy. Based on some assumptions, the authors discover that at most two disparity candidates for each scanline segment of reference image can be extracted. With this observation, the authors present a disparity candidate extraction algorithm. This algorithm constructs an energy function based on colour consistency and restrictions between region boundaries. In this approach, the energy function is optimised via the graph-cuts technique, and the pixels involved are only those positioned on region boundaries, which results in greatly reduced vertex number in the constructed graph and subsequently improved efficiency. After that, a simple partial occlusions handling is conducted as a post-processing to enhance the accuracy of the final disparity map, by selecting a right disparity for each segment from extracted candidates. The performances of our method are demonstrated by experiments on the Middlebury test set. © 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

It leads to the big error in prediction of object's next position when applying trajectory prediction method for common perspective image. The authors adopt unifying catadioptric imaging sphere projection model to project object's imaging point in omnidirectional images onto the sphere where the author then establishes omnidirectional kalman filter to predict next position of the object. The result of prediction will project back to omnidirectional image to fulfill position prediction of objects.

Thus, traditional definition of the neighborhood cannot be appropriate for omnidirectional images. In this paper, make use of ratio of resolution between different position in image, we propose a new system of neighborhood adapted to the omnidirectional images and deduce a new formula for calculating resolution of a catadioptric sensor. We show that this definition of neighborhood for catadioptric omnidirectional image conduce a more coincident result than traditional one in application of moving target detection base on Markov random fields.

79955662474	Depth estimation from a single still image of street scene based on content understanding	A method for depth estimation by understanding how the objects compose the whole scene in a single image of street scene is presented. Firstly, a single image of street scene is segmented into regions. The features of each region and the associated features of its neighbor area are extracted. And the regions are classified as types of object with features of each region by machine learning method, which shows how the image is made up of every object. Then, the depth of ground is estimated by the relationship between coordinate in image and depth in the real world of the same object which is deduced from pin-hole imaging model. And the depth of others in image is estimated by not only the relative position between the objects and ground but also the change of some features in objects. The depth map of image is produced at last. The experiment shows that our algorithm performs better than others and the result of depth estimation reflects the location of each object in the real world exactly.

In this paper, we discuss the optical landmark-based camera tracking method in virtual studio applications. Studio cameras are zoom lens imaging device, both the internal parameters and external parameters of the camera are allowed to vary from image to image. Optical tracking --uses pattern recognition--eliminates the need for painstaking calibration of the lens system and can be used with any camera mount, including hand-held cameras. Here we address the problem of accurately tracking the 3D motion and focus of a monocular camera in a known 3D environment and dynamically estimating the 3D location and focus of the camera. We utilize fully automated landmark-based camera calibration to initialize the motion estimation and employ extended Kalman filter techniques to track landmarks and to estimate the camera location and focus. The implementation of our approach has been proven to be efficient and robust and our system successfully tracks in real-time at approximately 25 Hz. This paper describes several years of work at the NUDT Multimedia laboratory to develop optical pattern recognition and tracking systems for use in virtual studio.

This paper proposes flip horizontally perspective image, and then matches separately the original image and the flipped image with omnidirectional image, takes a better match as the final result to achieve the mirror invariant. For the ring distortion of the omnidirectional image, the perspective image is transformed to the fan-shaped image before the matching, and two methods are provided to transform the perspective image to the fan-shaped image. Experimental results on the real image show, after the perspective image is transformed to the fan-shaped image and then match with omnidirectional images, the total number of matching points is increased, while the number of the wrong matching points is reduced, matching results are better than one without the transformation.

81355130405	Complementary-structure catadioptric omnidirectional sensor design for resolution enhancement	Considering the problem of low and nonuniform resolution in omnidirectional imaging, a complementary catadioptric imaging method is proposed by using multiple mirrors. Due to the reflection of mirrors, each spatial object has two imaging positions, in the inner and outer of sampled omnidirectional images, respectively, which are generated from two different optical paths. For instance, a prototype of omnidirectional sensor based on complementary double imaging is designed, which contains two convex mirrors (cone and hyperboloid) in conjunction with a plane mirror. The design constraints and optical geometric model of imaging are analyzed in detail. By mathematical analysis, two improvements of resolution have been achieved: (1) more uniform distribution of resolution and (2) complementary resolution distribution in the radial and tangential directions between the inner and outer.

81355142742	Fusion of complementary catadioptric panoramic images based on nonsubsampled contourlet transform	The problem of low and nonuniform resolution has long been a topic of research in omnidirectional imaging. A novel fusion method based on nonsubsampled contourlet transform is proposed in this paper to fuse the pair of complementary panoramic images unwrapped from the inner and outer of the omni-image. This work can be considered as a continuation research of the complementary-structure catadioptric imaging technique based on multiple mirrors. Specifically, the high-frequency details are extracted by nonsubsampled directional filters only in the horizontal and vertical directions, since the complementarity mostly exists in two orthogonal directions. The horizontal and vertical high-frequency coefficients of the fused image are selected from the panoramic image which has the advantage in the corresponding direction. The fusion rule for the low-frequency coefficients is an improved selecting scheme with considering the high-frequency directional vector. Simulation experiments based on decimation and interpolation are implemented using the proposed fusion method, which outperforms other existing fusion methods in terms of both visual quality and objective evaluation. The proposed fusion method has demonstrated on experiments that both indoor and outdoor of real-scene imaging can gain better performance by using our prototype omnidirectional sensor. © 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Compared with density based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), the QDBSCAN makes some improvements in such aspects: Define the shortest viable path as the similarity measurement to make the clustering algorithm more coincident with the rules of computer wargames, set the density parameters dynamically instead of statically, choose a small number of representative objects to expand the cluster, which reduces the execution frequency of region query; groups the whole dataset by divisiory regions to reduce the scale of clustering.

81755185907	Nonsingle viewpoint omni-stereo depth estimation via space layer labeling	An omni-directional stereo system has a wider field-of-view than conventional cameras, and is widely used in many applications such as robots navigation, depth estimation, and 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches usually use single viewpoint (SVP) systems as the imaging sensor. However, literature proves that an efficient SVP of an omni-directional system can only be achieved with precisely aligned mirrors of parabolic or hyperbolic profile. This enforces rigorous restriction on the configuration of camera and mirrors. In fact, some other profiles, though they do not have the SVP property, are desirable for certain reasons such as cheaper cost and more practical implementation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose both a typical nonsingle viewpoint (non-SVP) omni-directional stereo sensor and its corresponding depth estimation method based on graph-cuts optimization. The sensor comprises a perspective camera and two separate reflective mirrors that could be any radially-symmetric ones. To formulate the depth estimation more consistent with the proposed sensor, we divide the depth space of scenes with a sequence of virtual coaxial cylindrical layers, and model depth estimation as a labeling problem. In the labeling procedure, by considering the characteristics of an omni-directional image, we further devise novel tangential-neighborhood system, radial-neighborhood system, and depth-gradual-changing smoothness constraint which perform better than traditional ones. Depth estimation and 3D reconstruction for both synthesis and real scenes justify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

84863373321	Depth space partitioning for omni-stereo object tracking	Using stereo disparity or depth information to detect and track moving objects is receiving increasing attention in recent years. However, this approach suffers from some difficulties, such as synchronisation between two cameras and doubling of the image-data size. Besides, traditional stereo-imaging systems have a limited field of view (FOV), which means that they need to rotate the cameras when an object moves out of view. In this research, the authors present a depth-space partitioning algorithm for performing object tracking using single-camera omni-stereo imaging system. The proposed method uses a catadioptric omni-directional stereo-imaging system to capture omni-stereo image 'pairs.' This imaging system has 360° FOV, avoiding the need for rotating cameras when tracking a moving object. In order to estimate omni-stereo disparity, the authors present a depth-space partitioning strategy. It partitions three-dimensional depth space with a series of co-axial cylinders, models the disparity estimation as a pixel-labelling problem and establishes an energy minimisation function for solving this problem using graph cuts optimisation. Based on the omni-stereo disparity-estimation results, the authors detect and track-moving objects based on omni-stereo disparity motion vector, which is the difference between two consecutive disparity maps. Experiments on moving car tracking justify the proposed method. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

84865388509	Efficient omni-image unwarping using geometric symmetry	In order to save storage space of a pano-mapping table used in omni-image unwarping, a geometric symmetry method is proposed. First of all, this method partitions a 360° omni-image into eight 45° omni-image sectors. Then, we partition the pano-mapping table into eight regions accordingly, with each pano-mapping table region corresponding to exactly one omni-image sector. We analyze the geometric symmetry relationship among these omni-image sectors and pano-mapping table regions. We find that if we know the mapping data in any one pano-mapping table region, it is easy to calculate the mapping data of the other seven panomapping table regions. Thus, in the final step, we perform omni-image unwarping based on only one pano-mapping table region, which reduces pano-mapping table size by seven-eighths. Reducing the pano-mapping size is very useful for implementing omni-image unwarping in embedded systems. Experiments on TI DSP-based embedded systems indicate that the proposed method reduces seven-eighths of pano-mapping table size, and improves the unwarping speed by a factor of 2.74. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

One design of catadioptric omnidirectional imaging system for defocus deblurring is proposed. The defocus blur of catadioptric omnidirectional imaging is analyzed in theory, and the relation between point spread function of omnidirectional image and scene's spatial points or the position of virtual features is established. Then, the defocus blur kernel of omnidirectional image is spatially invariant when image plane is moved in a particular pattern during image integration. A deconvolution algorithm is used for the defocus blur omnidirectional image restoration to obtain all sharp omnidirectional images.

84872371884	Coded aperture techniques for catadioptric omni-directional image defocus deblurring	The defocus blur in catadioptric omni-directional imaging is caused by large apertures and mirror curvatures. This problem becomes more obviously when introducing high resolution sensors. In order to overcome this drawback, this work proposes a simple modification to a conventional catadioptric system that allows for the recovery of an all-focus omni-directional image. The modification is designed by inserting a patterned occluder within the aperture of the camera lens, creating a coded aperture. Then this work introduces a specific deconvolution method, which can recover an all-focus omni-directional image from photograph(s) taken by the camera with coded aperture. Comparing to the conventional aperture, the coded aperture techniques identify the blur scale easier and more accurate. The recovered sharp image eliminates the defocus blur and shows the efficiency of the algorithm. The obtained sharp image can be combined for various catadioptric applications, including omni-directional monitoring systems, intelligent omni-directional systems and robotics, etc. © 2012 IEEE.

To enhance this research, our paper focuses on how to generate a high-resolution panoramic image from the captured omnidirectional image. To avoid the interference between the inner and outer images while fusing the two complementary views, a cross-selection kernel regression method is proposed. First, in view of the complementarity of sampling resolution in the tangential and radial directions between the inner and the outer images respectively, the horizontal gradients in the expected panoramic image are estimated based on the scattered neighboring pixels mapped from the outer, while the vertical gradients are estimated using the inner image. Then, the size and shape of the regression kernel are adaptively steered based on the local gradients. Furthermore, the neighboring pixels in the next interpolation step of kernel regression are also selected based on the comparison between the horizontal and vertical gradients. In simulation and real-image experiments, the proposed method outperforms existing kernel regression methods and our previous wavelet-based fusion method in terms of both visual quality and objective evaluation. © 2012 IEEE.

In particular, our method can be applied without considering planar checkerboard, iterative fitting of model parameters, complex computation, or traditional lookup tables. Therefore, our algorithm is suitable for embedded camera platform without any extra hardware resources. © 2012 IEEE.

Firstly, the MVs of macroblocks were accumulated and filtered. The Jacobian matrix was used to describe the relationship between parameters of global motion and MV in each macroblock, which makes the computation of global motion parameters easier than before. Then the motion areas were detected by the similarity of local motion and global motion. Secondly, the remarkable blocks of DCT energy were accumulated in temporal by the reliable motion around them. Then the border and texture area was found by the accumulations of DCT energy with the local self-adaptive threshold which selected by entropy. Finally, the results which had been detected by MV and DCT respectively were combined. The experiments shows that the method proposed can detect the motion object in compressed video accurately, and the result of can achieve good recall and precision simultaneously.

The algorithm is composed of three parts: trajectory pretreatment, trajectory segments clustering, and visual presentation. Trajectory pretreatment transforms original trajectories into simplified ones which are ulteriorly processed into linear segments. In the second part, the concept of density function derived from DENCLUE is introduced and trajectory segments are clustered based on similarity measure under the framework of DBSCAN. The visual presentation exhibits clusters of trajectory segments with martial meanings to trainees, which embodies practical values of CTECW.

84880011071	A three-point calibration method for fish-eye camera equivalent focal length	To calibrate the equivalent focal length of a fish-eye camera is a complicated problem. This paper puts forward a three-point calibration method to solve the challenging situation. Based on the equidistant projection model and the spatial model of a fish-eye camera, considering the cosine theorem, this paper derives a theoretic equation, only containing one unknown quantity of equivalent focal length, which lays a solid foundation for measuring the equivalent focal length of a fish-eye camera by the three-point method. To verify the three-point calibration method experimentally, this paper conducts a simulation test in practice. Randomly select three coinciding points on the ground, measure the distance among them and then calculate the equivalent focal length by the fish-eye camera image which contains the three points. The three-point calibration method simplifies the procedure and reduces the complexity of measuring a fish-eye camera equivalent focal length. The results of the simulation show the accuracy and the feasibility of the three-point method. The equivalent focal length calibrated by using the three-point method is more close to the factory parameter of fish-eye lens than other traditional methods and toolbox.

Notably, the precise registration of the two paired panoramic images is the essential precondition for further research. Firstly, the spacial poses of the reflecting mirrors are calibrated according to the elliptical boundaries of the mirror boundary imaging, then the inner and the outer rings of the omnidirectional image are unwrapped into two calibrated cylindrical panoramic images respectively based on the calibration results. Then, the generalized least squares (GLS) algorithm is used to solve the polynomial transform model, and more accurate sub-pixel registration of the two primarily registrated panoramic images is performed. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm fulfils the registration accuracy requirement of image fusion, and the fusion results further verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

84885584103	Human action recognition with Optimized Video Densely Sampling	Dense sample video patches have been used for video representation in action recognition and achieve better performance than sparse spatiotemporal local features. However, two problems of this method must be considered. First one, many video patches are from background other than human body. Second one, the descriptor is not reliable, since it is neither shift nor scale invariant. To solve these two problems, we proposed an Optimized Video Dense Sampling (OVDS) method combing with dense sampling and spatiotemporal interest points detector. OVDS densely sampled video patches with optimizing the position and scale parameters to guarantee the features are shift and scale invariant. To omit the action unrelated features, we extracted video patches only from human body regions instead of the whole videos. Experimental results on KTH, Weizmann, UCF, Hoollywood2 datasets showed that the features detected by OVDS are informative and reliable for action recognition, and achieve better performance over the existing spatiotemporal local features. © 2013 IEEE.

84885626124	Action recognition using Feature Position Constrained Linear Coding	Recently space-time interest points (STIPs) using bag-of-feature (BOF) in action recognition has been highly successful. Despite its popularity, The quantization error and the lost of semantic meaning among STIPs are the main weaknesses that severely limit the effectiveness of this method. To overcome these limitations, this paper incorporated the feature position information into coding procedure and proposed a novel Feature Position Constrained Linear Coding (FPLC) method by extending the Locality Constrained Linear Coding (LLC) approach. It first project the features into the human ROI, then codes the features locally using FPLC with the consideration of feature position. Owning to that the local area of human ROI often aggregate features extracted from the same part of human body and those features should exhibit similar values, this local coding strategy helps to alleviate the quantization error and enhance correlation between features at the same time, which helps to improve the recognition accuracy.

The problem of catadioptric omnidirectional imaging defocus blur, which is caused by lens aperture and mirror curvature, becomes more severe when high resolution sensors and large apertures are applied. In the catadioptric omnidirectional image, the two points near each other do not have the relation in true scene.

84887000950	Local spatiotemporal coding and sparse representation based human action recognition	To handle with the limitation of bag-of-features (BoF) model which ignores spatial and temporal relationships of local features in human action recognition in video, a Local Spatiotemporal Coding (LSC) is proposed. Rather than the exiting methods only uses the feature appearance information for coding, LSC encodes feature appearance and spatiotemporal positions information simultaneously with vector quantization (VQ). It can directly models the spatiotemporal relationships of local features in space time volume (STV). In implement, the local features are projected into sub-space-time-volume (sub-STV), and encoded with LSC. In addition a multi-level LSC is also provided. Then a group of sub-STV descriptors obtained from videos with multi-level LSC and Avg-pooling are used for action video classification. A sparse representation based classification method is adopted to classify action videos upon these sub-STV descriptors.

The fish-eye panoramic camera is capable of monitoring a large field of view and it owns larger observation range than traditional camera. However, the objects are not able to be correctly identified if they are far from the panoramic cameras because of low-resolution images. To overcome this problem, the PTZ dome camera was used to locate and the target could be displayed clearly, which had high mobility and zoom ability. The interaction of master-slave surveillance system was that the user detected a target from the panoramic camera and controlled the PTZ camera to fixate at the target. In order to achieve the precise interaction, a novel calibration method was proposed to automatically calculate transformation function between the pixel in the fish-eye image and the PTZ camera's motion parameters by building the interaction model of Master-Slave surveillance system and matching the image feature points.

The resolution distribution of catadioptric omnidirectional imaging systems is analyzed based on the unit sphere model. According to the relation between mean square error (MSE) and sparsity, measurement number, a non-uniform measurement matrix, which is based on the distribution of the imaging system's resolution, is designed in this paper. Based on the designed measurement matrix, it allocates more sensing resources to inner parts but fewer to outer parts of the catadioptric omnidirectional image. This scheme takes the resolution of omnidirectional image into account, which is increased from the center to the periphery. The non-uniform compressed samples of the observed scene are captured from the ray light which is reflected from the mirror. The linear Bregman iteration is employed as the reconstruction algorithm to obtain the high and uniform resolution image. The algorithm is tested on synthetic and realistic images. Experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective. The recovered image has higher and much more uniform resolution than that reconstructed by traditional method.

Furthermore, it also suffers from serious representation error. We propose an innovative coding strategy called position and locality constrained soft coding (PLSC) to overcome these limitations. PLSC uses the feature position in a human oriented region of interest (ROI) to distinguish the ambiguous features. We first construct a subdictionary for each feature by selecting the bases from their spatial neighbor in human ROI. Then, a modified soft coding with locality constraint is adopted to alleviate the quantization error and preserve the manifold structure of features. This novel coding algorithm increases both the representation accuracy and discriminative power with low computational cost.

84894281597	A real-time video denoising algorithm with FPGA implementation for Poisson-Gaussian noise	The denoising function in digital imaging devices must consider resource consumption and real-time capability in addition to effective noise-removal performance. One commonly used denoising method is pixel similarity weighted frame averaging (PSWFA). In this study, we improve the denoising capability of PSWFA using a pre-filter that consists of a downsampling operator and a small Gaussian filter. Moreover, given that noise in digital imaging devices is signal dependent and is typically modeled as a Poisson-Gaussian distribution, we introduce generalized Anscombe transformation to remove the signal dependency by rendering the noise variance constant. The transformed image can be considered corrupted by an approximately Gaussian noise. To embed our algorithm in hardware, we implement our algorithm on a Spartan-6 FPGA for evaluation. We also compare our algorithm with some existing denoising methods on FPGA. For further evaluation of the denoising ability, the algorithm is compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms that are not implemented on FPGA but have high performance on a personal computer. Experimental results on both simulated noise videos and actually captured low-light noise videos show the effectiveness of our algorithm, particularly in the processing of large-scale noise. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84897498520	Green channel guiding denoising on bayer image	Denoising is an indispensable function for digital cameras. In respect that noise is diffused during the demosaicking, the denoising ought to work directly on bayer data. The difficulty of denoising on bayer image is the interlaced mosaic pattern of red, green, and blue. Guided filter is a novel time efficient explicit filter kernel which can incorporate additional information from the guidance image, but it is still not applied for bayer image. In this work, we observe that the green channel of bayer mode is higher in both sampling rate and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) than the red and blue ones. Therefore the green channel can be used to guide denoising. This kind of guidance integrates the different color channels together. Experiments on both actual and simulated bayer images indicate that green channel acts well as the guidance signal, and the proposed method is competitive with other popular filter kernel denoising methods. © 2014 Xin Tan et al.

84898844436	A master-slave surveillance system to acquire panoramic and multiscale videos	This paper describes a master-slave visual surveillance system that uses stationary-dynamic camera assemblies to achieve wide field of view and selective focus of interest. In this system, the fish-eye panoramic camera is capable of monitoring a large area, and the PTZ dome camera has high mobility and zoom ability. In order to achieve the precise interaction, preprocessing spatial calibration between these two cameras is required. This paper introduces a novel calibration approach to automatically calculate a transformation matrix model between two coordinate systems by matching feature points. In addition, a distortion correction method based on Midpoint Circle Algorithm is proposed to handle obvious horizontal distortion in the captured panoramic image. Experimental results using realistic scenes have demonstrated the efficiency and applicability of the system with real-time surveillance. © 2014 Yu Liu et al.

84898609240	Local feature space time coding for human action recognition	In order to overcome the limitation of Bag of Features (BoF), which ignores the space time relationship of local features in human action recognition, a space time coding (STC) method for local feature was proposed by involving the space time locations of local features into feature coding phase to directly model their space time relationship. First, the local features were projected into a sub space-time-volume (sub-STV) to obtain their space time coordinates. Second, their appearance information and space time locations were encoded simultaneously. After that, the statistics results generated by feature pooling upon these codes were utilized for action classification. To achieve better performance, the multi-scale STC and locality-constrained STC were also proposed. In action classification, a locality-constrained block sparse representation classifier (LBSRC) was adopted to improve the action recognition accuracy. The experimental results on KTH, Weizmann, and UCF sports benchmark datasets showed that the proposed methods can effectively represent the space time relationship of local features and improve the action recognition accuracy.

84901237557	A spatial calibration method for master-slave surveillance system	The master-slave surveillance system uses stationary-dynamic camera assemblies to achieve wide-area surveillance and selective focus-of-interest. In such a system, a stationary fish-eye camera monitors a panoramic field of environment from a distance, while a dynamic PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) dome camera is commanded to acquire high-resolution images from a focused direction and provide multi-scale zoomed-in information. In order to achieve the precise interaction, pre-processing spatial calibration between these two cameras is required. This paper introduces a novel vision based calibration approach to automatically calculate a transformation matrix model between the fish-eye coordinate system and the PTZ dome coordinate system by matching feature points in the scene. The experiment has demonstrated the effectiveness of using this method with high accuracy in short calibration time. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

84902126497	Omni-total variation algorithm for the restoration of all-focused catadioptric image	In this paper, we present a novel omni-total variation (Omni-TV) algorithm for the restoration of defocus blur to obtain all-focused catadioptric image. Catadioptric omni-directional imaging systems usually consist of conventional cameras and curved mirrors for capturing 360°field of view. Mirror curvature in the catadioptric camera often leads to noticeable blurring artifacts in omni-directional imaging. The problem becomes more severe when high resolution sensor is introduced. In an omni-directional image, two points near each other may not be close to one another in the 3D scene. Traditional gradient computation cannot be directly applied to omni-directional image processing. Thus, an omni-gradient computing method combined with the characteristics of catadioptric imaging is proposed, in which an Omni-TV minimization is used as the constraint for deconvolution regularization. The proposed method is vital for improving catadioptric omni-directional imaging quality and promoting applications in related fields like omni-directional video and image processing. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

84906313657	A compromise ratio ranking method of triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and its application to MADM problems	Triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TIFNs) is a special case of intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) set and the ranking of TIFNs is an important problem. The aim of this paper is to develop a new methodology for ranking TIFNs by using multiattribute decision making methods (MADM). In this methodology, the value and ambiguity indices of TIFNs may be considered as the attributes and the TIFNs in comparison are seen as the alternatives. A compromise ratio method for fuzzy MADM is developed based on the concept that larger TIFN should close to the maximum value index and is far away from the minimum ambiguity index simultaneously. The proposed ranking method is applied to solve multiattribute decision making problems in which the ratings of alternatives on attributes are expressed by using TIFNs. Numerical examples are examined to demonstrate the implementation process and applicability of the proposed method in this paper. Furthermore, a comparison analysis of the proposed method is conducted to show its advantages over other methods.

84910103379	Real-time discrimination of frontal face using integral channel features and Adaboost	In this paper we present a novel approach for discrimination of frontal face in video, using integral channel features(ICF) and Adaboost. We have two stages for this approach based on classification, the first stage is training process, we utilize ICF exacted from training database to train strong classifier, which is implemented by Adaboost. The second stage is discriminating process by scoring, we compute ICF of the face detection window, and then scoring the window using the trained classifier, and at last the most frontal face will be chosen by the highest scores. Furthermore, we then apply the approach to the ChokePoint database and compare with different approaches, showing a good performance.

84920698257	Intuitionistic fuzzy programming models for matrix games with payoffs of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers	The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology for solving matrix games with payoffs of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TrIFNs). In this methodology, the concepts of TrIFNs and solutions for matrix games with payoffs of TrIFNs are defined. Two new auxiliary intuitionistic fuzzy nonlinear programming models are hereby constructed to solve matrix games with payoffs of TrIFNs. Using a new ranking method based on the value and ambiguity of TrIFNs, the auxiliary intuitionistic fuzzy nonlinear programming models are transformed into the bi-objective parameterized nonlinear programming models, which are further integrated into the parameterized linear programming models, which are used to obtain solutions of matrix games with payoffs of TrIFNs. The validity and applicability of the proposed methodology in this paper are illustrated with a numerical example.

84922723689	Omni-gradient-based total variation minimisation for sparse reconstruction of omni-directional image	Total variation (TV) minimisation algorithms have been successfully applied in compressive sensing (CS) recovery for natural images owing to its advantage of preserving edges. However, traditional TV is no longer appropriate for omni-directional image processing because of the distortions in catadioptric imaging systems. The omni-gradient computing method combined with the characteristics of omni-directional imaging is proposed in this study. To reconstruct the image from its compressive samples, the omni-total variation (omni-TV) regularisation based on omni-gradient is utilised instead of traditional TV during the image restoration. The experimental results show that the omni-directional images can be reconstructed effectively and accurately. Compared with the classical TV minimisation model, the images recovered based on omni-TV model can provide higher quality both in subjective evaluation and objective evaluation.
