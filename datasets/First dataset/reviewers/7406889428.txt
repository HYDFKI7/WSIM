84943699053	Learning Thoracoscopic Lobectomy in Resident Training	Background Thoracoscopic lobectomy is a safe and effective procedure; however, the ways by which to incorporate this technically demanding procedure into residency training is still unknown. We reported on the outcomes of thoracoscopic lobectomies performed by a single thoracic resident, who was simultaneously undergoing training for both open and thoracoscopic lobectomies. Patients and Methods Between January 2010, and May 2011, data from 87 consecutive thoracoscopic lobectomies that were performed by a trainee surgeon (B.-Y.W.) were prospectively obtained. Data were grouped into the first 30 and subsequent 57 cases. Patient characteristics, operative data, complications, and surgical pathology were analyzed. Results The mean operating time in group 2 was significantly lower compared with group 1 (264.0 ± 45.9 min in group 1 vs. 197.5 ± 57.7 min in group 2; p < 0.001). There were no mortalities in both the groups and no significant differences in postoperative complications. Conclusions Thoracoscopic lobectomy can be taught to a nonexperienced thoracic resident during an open procedure without compromising the safety of patients. It appears that surgical performance reaches a plateau after the completion of 30 cases.

9244236528	Surgical results of upper thoracic esophageal carcinoma	Background. Due to its anatomical location, carcinoma of the upper thoracic esophagus (i.e. below the thoracic inlet and above the carina) often results in early invasion of adjacent structures and precludes radical resection. The prognosis of carcinoma of the upper thoracic esophagus was considered worse than that of distal esophagus. There are few studies specifically addressing the prognostic factors in the surgical treatment for carcinoma in this location. Herein we report a retrospective study conducted to analyze the result of surgical treatment for carcinoma of the upper thoracic esophagus. Methods. From January 1983 to December 2002, 298 cases were diagnosed with upper thoracic esophageal carcinoma in our institute. Among them, 78 cases underwent operation with curative intent and were enrolled for study. Results. The tumors were stage I in 7.7%, stage II in 42.3%, stage III in 33.3% and stage IV in 12.8%. The postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 59.0% and 6.8%, respectively. Pulmonary complication was the most common morbidity and also the leading cause of postoperative death. The overall median survival time after surgery was 13.1 months. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 53.9%, 28.7% and 21.4%, respectively. There was an improvement in surgical result over time. The 5-year survival rate improved from 13.6% in the earlier 10-year period to 37.6% in the latter 10-year period (p = 0.0493). Univariate analysis revealed 5 positive prognostic factors: tumor length (p = 0.0012), pT status (p = 0.0274), pN status (P = 0.001), pathologic stage (p = 0.0322) and R category (p = 0.0009). Multivariate analysis identified pN status, R category and tumor length as independent prognostic indicators. In patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy, the 5-year survival rate after surgery was 23.4%, which was similar to those undergoing surgery alone (p = 0.5174). For patients with advanced tumor stages (ie. pT>3, pN> 0, pM>0) or with residual tumors (R

14244250788	Pulmonary metastasectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma	Background. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is seldom resectable due to advanced status. Even though hepatectomy is feasible, a large proportional of patients may still develops extrahepatic recurrence. Pulmonary metastasis is the most common site of extrahepatic spread. Few articles have discussed the benefit of resection for lung metastasis after curative hepatectomy. We evaluated the general information and the result of lung resection for patients having lung metastasis after curative resection of HCC. Methods. Six patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for HCC at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between August 1995 and May 2004 were enrolled in the study. All of them had received the hepatectomy for primary HCC. The demographic information of patients, the site and number of extrahepatic recurrence, the method of surgical intervention and the outcome after surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Results. There were 4 men and 2 women with the mean age of 47.3 years. All of them were HBV carriers. Five patients had multiple pulmonary metastases removed by wedge resection. Two patients had bilateral lung metastases upon diagnosis of extrahepatic recurrence. The mean duration of follow-up after hepatic resection was 75.0 ± 25.1 months (32 to 104 months). The mean survival after pulmonary resection was 47.2 ± 34.3months (1 to 94 months). Four patients are still alive and free of the disease. One patient is alive but with the disease. One patient who refused further aggressive treatment after resection of lung metastasis died of the disease 40 months after lung resection, 77 months after hepatic resection. Conclusions. Lung resection for the pulmonary metastasis of HCC can result in a favorable long-term survival when there is no other intrahepatic or extraphepatic recurrence of HCC. For patients with multiple lung metastases in different lobes or different lungs, aggressive surgical resection is recommended if complete resection can be achieved.

1542346111	Pulmonary hamartoma	Background. Pulmonary hamartoma is the most common type of benign lung tumors. We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathological features of 61 patients with pulmonary hamartomas undergoing surgical resection in our institution. Methods. From 1971 to 2002, 61 patients with 62 pulmonary hamartomas underwent surgical resection in the Division of Thoracic Surgery, Taipei Veterans General Hospital. 45 were men and 16 were women (approximately in 3:1 ratio). Their mean age was 56.9 years (range 20 to 77 years).The medical records of these patients were reviewed. The information collected using a standardized data-collection form consisted of the age at presentation, gender, initial manifestations or symptoms, history of tobacco consumption, location of hamartoma, size of the lesions, state of calcification in the hamartoma, the results of preoperative bronchoscopic examination, operative procedures and pathological report of intra-operative frozen section. All available histological slides were reviewed by the same pathologist to reconfirm the diagnosis of pulmonary hamartoma. Results. Of the 61 patients with pulmonary hamartoma, 41 patients were clinically asymptomatic, 16 patients had new onset of respiratory symptoms and 4 patients had chronic cough. One patient had synchronous 2 separate lesions. The hamartomas were equally distributed in the pulmonary lobes with the mean transverse diameter of 1.8 cm measured in operation (range 0.2 to 5.0). No tumor recurrence developed after resection in our series. The mean follow-up was 8.9 years. Conclusions. The vast majority of pulmonary hamartomas represent as solitary pulmonary nodule. Definite diagnosis and the treatment can be achieved by surgical resection with minimal morbidity. No tumor recurrence was encountered in the follow-up period.

18744363639	Intramural lipoma of the esophagus	Lipomas of the gastrointestinal tract are rare, and those of the esophagus are extremely rare. Indeed, fewer than 20 resected cases of esophageal lipoma have been reported in the literature. In the current case, a 71-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of a slight swallowing disturbance in the upper chest. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a submucosal space-occupying mass, with normal mucosa, in the upper third of the thoracic esophagus; the mass was yellowish in color, soft in consistency, and about 3.5 × 3.0 cm in diameter. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic enucleation of the submucosal esophageal tumor, which pathologically, was proved to be a lipoma. © 2005 Elsevier. All rights reserved.

20144381465	Copy number changes of target genes in chromosome 3q25.3-qter of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: TP63 is amplified in early carcinogenesis but down-regulated as disease progressed	Aim: By using comparative genomic hybridization, gain of 3q was found in 45-86% cases of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (EC-SCC). Chromosome 3q25.3-qter is the minimal common region with several oncogenes found within this region. However, amplification patterns of these genes in EC-SCC have never been reported. The possible association of copy number changes of these genes with pathologic characteristics is still not clear. Methods: Real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) was performed to analyze the copy number changes of 13 candidate genes within this region in 60 primary tumors of EC-SCC, and possible association of copy number changes with pathologic characteristics was analyzed by statistics. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) study was also performed on another set of 111 primary tumors of EC-SCC to verify the association between TP63 expression change and lymph node metastasis status. Results: The average copy numbers (±SE) per haploid genome of individual genes in 60 samples were (from centromere to telomere): SSR3: 4.19 (±0.69); CCNL1: 5.24 (±0.67); SMC4L1: 2.01 (±0.16); EVI1: 2.02 (±0.12); hTERC: 5.28 (±0.54); SKIL: 2.71 (±0.14); EIF5A2: 1.95 (±0.12); ECT2: 9.18 (±1.68); PIK3CA: 8.13 (±1.17); EIF4G1: 1.07 (±0.05); SST: 3.07 (±0.25); TP63: 2.51 (±0.22); TFRC: 2.42 (±0.19). Four clusters of amplification were found: SSR3 and CCLN1 at 3q25.31; hTERC and SKIL at 3q26.2; ECT2 and PIK3CA at 3q26.31-q26.32; and SST, TP63 and TFRC at 3q27.3-q29. Patients with lymph node metastasis had significantly lower copy number of TP63 in the primary tumor than those without lymph node metastasis. IHC study on tissue arrays also showed that patients with lymph node metastasis have significantly lower TP63 staining score in the primary tumor than those without lymph node metastasis. Conclusion: This study showed that different amplification patterns were seen among different genes within 3q25.3-qter in EC-SCC, and several novel candidate oncogenes (SSR3, SMC4L1, ECT2, and SST) were identified. TP63 is amplified in early stage of EC-SCC carcinogenesis but down-regulated in advanced stage of disease. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

0031744244	Management of descending necrotizing mediastinitis	Background. Descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM) is uncommon, and may be lethal if not treated adequately and promptly. Delayed diagnosis of the disease is sometimes encountered in clinical practice. Methods. Eight consecutive patients with acute DNM were identified between 1991 and 1995, including five men and three women. The mean age was 45.8 years (range, 22- 71 years). The infectious sources consisted of six esophageal perforations, one cervical cutting injury and one tonsillitis. The clinical presentations were evaluated. Diagnostic procedures including chest radiograph, sonogram and computerized tomography scans of the chest and neck were examined. Diagnosis and treatment, including culture results from drained fluids and debrided tissues, and antibiotic and supportive therapies were reviewed. Results. Six patients who underwent aggressive surgical treatment recovered well. Two patients who received supportive treatment died of sepsis alone. The cultured bacteria included: Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, Trichosporum and other mixed oral cavity flora. Conclusions. Early diagnosis and adequate antibiotic and support therapies are essential to achieve good patient outcomes in acute descending mediastinitis. Adequate drainage and debridement, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and sufficient nutritional and respiratory support are the main treatment elements.

2442628404	Lymph Node Metastasis in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Intrathoracic Esophagus	Background. In esophageal carcinoma lymph node metastasis is one of the most important factors of prognosis. This prospective study evaluated the incidence and extent of lymph node metastasis, and assessed the relationship between the depth of tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis in esophageal carcinoma. Methods. Between 1985 and 1996, tissue samples from 112 patients undergoing radical esophagectomy and gastric substitution for squamous cell carcinoma of the intrathoracic esophagus were collected. Patients with distant organ metastasis were excluded. All specimens were evaluated and sent for histopathologic examination. Results. In 108 men and four women with a mean age of 63.1 years, the average number of dissected lymph nodes in one surgical procedure, was 30 per person. The most commonly involved nodes were the periesophageal (42.9%) and the perigastric (42.9%) nodes, followed by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (23.8%) and thoracic paratracheal (22.2%) nodes. For tumors in the upper third of the esophagus, the most frequently involved nodal groups were the periesophageal (28.6%) and the paratracheal (28.6%) nodes, followed by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (21.4%) the deep cervical (21.4%), and the perigastric (21.4%) nodes. For tumors in the middle third of the esophagus, the periesophageal nodes (27.3%) were most commonly involved, followed by the perigastric (18.2%) and the subcarina (10.6%) nodes. For tumors in the lower third of the esophagus, the perigastric lymph nodes (37.5%) were the most common nodal metastatic site, followed by the celiac (18.8%) and the recurrent laryngeal nerve (18.2%) nodes. Depth of tumor invasion was also found to correlate significantly with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0015). Conclusions. Wide lymph node metastasis between the neck and the upper abdomen occurs frequently in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. For potentially curable esophageal carcinomas, en-bloc esophagectomy with complete locoregional lymph node dissection may provide favorable local control of the lesion and more accurate tumor staging.

3042671036	Managements of locally advanced unresectable thymic epithelial tumors	Background. Surgery is the treatment of choice for thymic epithelial tumors (TET), but the resectability is about 60-70%. For those with locally advanced unresectable TETs (LAU-TETs), some controversies about the prognostic factors and treatment modalities existed. The aims of this study are to elucidate the roles of various therapeutic options and to determine the survival and prognostic factors of LAU-TETs. Methods. Twenty-seven patients diagnosed with LAU-TETs underwent treatment in Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 1979 and 1997. Multiple treatment modalities, including surgical intervention, irradiation and chemotherapy, were advocated for these patients. The clinicopathological factors and the effects of the treatment modalities were evaluated retrospectively. Results. Twenty seven cases of LAU-TETs, included 18 thymomas (12 at stage III and 6 at stage IVa) and 9 thymic carcinomas (4 at stage III and 5 at stage IVa), were enrolled for study. The overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 54.6% and 35.1%, respectively. Patients receiving debulking surgery and those with irradiation dosage higher than 4400 cGy had significantly better survivals (P = 0.021 and P = 0.016, respectively). Conclusions. Aggressive debulking surgery and sufficient irradiation dosage provide better survivals for patients with LAU-TETs, especially for those with thymoma.

3142739422	Inverse expression of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase and glutathione-s- transferase in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	We investigated the significances of the expressions of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DDH) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). By using immunohistochemistry, we measured expressions of DDH, GST, COX-2, nm23-HI, HER-2/ neu and mdr-I in 145 patients with ESCC. Expression of DDH was confirmed by immunoblotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Relation between DDH expression and clinicopathological parameters was analyzed by statistical analysis. Difference of survivals between different groups was compared by a log rank test. DDH overexpression was detected in 66.9% of pathological sections (97/ 145) and in 41.6% of metastatic lymph nodes (37/89). The nucleoticle sequencing of DNA fragments from 16 tumorous specimens showed that the major isoform was DDH2 for ESCC. GST expression, however, was only detected weakly in 24 patients (16.6%). For patients with ESCC, DDH overexpression was positively correlated with smoking habit, tumor stage, number of metastatic lymph nodes, lymphovascular invasion and COX-2 expression, and inversely correlated with GST and nm23-HI expressions, but not related to mdr-I or HER-2/neu expressions. As compared to DDH overexpressed group, patients with low DDH expression had significantly lower incidence of tumor recurrences and better survival (p = 0.026). Using univariate analysis, prognostic factors included tumor stage, number of metastatic lymph nodes, cell differentiation, lymphovascular invasion and expressions of DDH and nm23-HI. Multivariate analysis showed significant correlation of tumor stage, number of metastatic lymph nodes and nm23-HI expression with patient's survival. In conclusion, inverse expressions of DDH and GST may be associated with carcinogenesis and disease progression for ESCC patients, but their biological function and pathophysiological regulation in tumors require additional studies. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

33748978607	Clinical implications of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 overexpression in human non-small-cell lung cancer	Background: Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) has recently been found to overexpress in human cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the clinical value is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between mPGES-1 expression in NSCLC and the clinical characteristics and survival outcome. Methods: Between 2001 and 2003, paired fresh tumorous and nontumorous samples were prospectively procured from patients undergoing surgery for NSCLC. The expression of mPGES-1 was assessed by using Western blot in 93 subjects and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 35. Overexpression of mPGES-1 was defined as a more than 2-fold expression in the tumorous sample compared with the corresponding nontumorous one. Immunohistochemistry was used to confirm its localization to the tumor cells. In a subset of 30 cases, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was also analyzed to assess its association with mPGES-1. Results: The protein and messenger RNA of mPGES-1 were both expressed at higher levels in the tumor samples (P < .001 and P = .006, respectively). The expressions of mPGES-1 and COX-2 were unrelated (P = .715). Overexpression of mPGES-1 protein was observed in 61 (65.6%) of 93 patients, but it was not significantly associated with the clinicopathologic characteristics or overall and disease-free survivals. However, mPGES-1 overexpression seemed to be associated with the likelihood of subsequent pulmonary metastases and a lower tendency for developing bony metastases (P = .001 and P = .006, respectively). Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that mPGES-1 was overexpressed in NSCLC, unassociated with COX-2. Overexpression of mPGES-1 per se was not a prognostic indicator, but it might be implicated in the organ preference of metastasis.

33748511025	Management of primary chest wall tumors: 14 years' clinical experience	Background: Primary chest wall tumor is rare but it encompasses tumors of various origins. We analyzed our experience with primary chest wall tumors with emphasis on its demographic presentation and management. Methods: From 1991 to 2004, 62 patients with the diagnosis of primary chest wall tumors were enrolled. Lipoma, chest wall metastasis, direct invasion from nearby malignancy, infection, and inflammation of chest wall were excluded. The clinical features, management, and the outcome of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. Results: There were 37 males and 25 females. Malignant and benign tumors were equally distributed. Chondrosarcoma and lymphoma were the 2 most common types of malignant chest wall tumors. The most common clinical symptoms were palpable mass (54.8%) and pain (40.3%). Nine of 31 patients (29.0%) with benign chest wall tumors were free of symptoms whereas patients with malignant chest wall tumors were all symptomatic (p = 0.002). A definite diagnosis was obtained in 21 of 26 patients (80.7%) who received nonexcision biopsy. All patients with primary chest wall tumors, except 6 who had medical treatment only, underwent surgical resection. Patients with malignant chest wall tumors were older than those with benign tumors (p < 0.001). The mean largest diameter of tumors was also larger in malignant tumors than in benign tumors (p = 0.04). Conclusion: Patients with primary malignant chest wall neoplasm were older than those with benign tumors. The mean size of malignant tumors was larger than that of benign tumors. Adequate surgical resection remains the treatment of choice for patients with primary chest wall tumors. Nonexcision biopsy should be reserved for patients with a past history of malignancy, suspicion of hematologic disease, and with high operative risk. For patients with isolated chest wall lymphoma, surgical resection followed by chemotherapy can be considered to obtain a better outcome. © 2006 Elsevier. All rights reserved.

34447256572	Chylothorax following extended thymectomy for myasthenia gravis	The effectiveness of extended thymectomy for the treatment of myasthenia gravis is well documented. Most of the postoperative complications have been related to respiratory distress or wound complication, but chylothorax following thymectomy has been reported as a rare complication. From January 1995 to December 2004, 217 patients underwent extended thymectomy for myasthenia gravis at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Three cases (1.38%) developed chylothorax after operation. Injury to the unseen division of the mediastinal lymphatics and branches from the thoracic duct during extensive dissection of perithymic fat tissue, which is seldom performed in classical thymothymectomy procedures, may have been the main cause of this complication. Two of the cases received conservative treatment and recovered uneventfully. The other patient (0.46%) underwent ligation of the thoracic duct 3 months later, which also resulted in the complication being cured. Conclusions: Post-thymectomy chylothorax is rare and seems to be related to extended thymectomy. Even a small invasive procedure such as VATS for extended thymectomy for myasthenia gravis could be complicated by chylothorax. We recommend that if chylothorax develops after thymectomy, conservative treatment is the treatment of choice; however, thoracic duct ligation is a useful method for treating long-term unhealed chylothorax. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

34347209095	Selection of DDX5 as a novel internal control for Q-RT-PCR from microarray data using a block bootstrap re-sampling scheme	Background: The development of microarrays permits us to monitor transcriptomes on a genome-wide scale. To validate microarray measurements, quantitative-real time-reverse transcription PCR (Q-RT-PCR) is one of the most robust and commonly used approaches. The new challenge in gene quantification analysis is how to explicitly incorporate statistical estimation in such studies. In the realm of statistical analysis, the various available methods of the probe level normalization for microarray analysis may result in distinctly different target selections and variation in the scores for the correlation between microarray and Q-RT-PCR. Moreover, it remains a major challenge to identify a proper internal control for Q-RT-PCR when confirming microarray measurements. Results: Sixty-six Affymetrix microarray slides using lung adenocarcinoma tissue RNAs were analyzed by a statistical re-sampling method in order to detect genes with minimal variation in gene expression. By this approach, we identified DDX5 as a novel internal control for Q-RT-PCR. Twenty-three genes, which were differentially expressed between adjacent normal and tumor samples, were selected and analyzed using 24 paired lung adenocarcinoma samples by Q-RT-PCR using two internal controls, DDX5 and GAPDH. The percentage correlation between Q-RT-PCR and microarray were 70% and 48% by using DDX5 and GAPDH as internal controls, respectively. Conclusion: Together, these quantification strategies for Q-RT-PCR data processing procedure, which focused on minimal variation, ought to significantly facilitate internal control evaluation and selection for Q-RT-PCR when corroborating microarray data. © 2007 Su et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

34548142651	Chromosomal aberrations of malignant pleural effusions of lung adenocarcinoma: Different cytogenetic changes are correlated with genders and smoking habits	Chromosomal aberrations of malignant cells from pleural effusions of 31 cases of lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed. Pooled CGH results showed frequent amplifications on chromosome arms 1p (22.6%), 1q (35.5%), 2q (25.8%), 3q (38.7%), 4q (41.9%), 5p (41.9%), 5q (51.6%), 6p (19.4%), 6q (25.8%), 7p (41.9%), 7q (35.5%), 8q (32.3%), 12q (38.7%), 13q (22.6%), 14q (35.5%), 17q (19.4%), Xp (22.6%), and Xq (38.7%). Frequent deletions were found on 1p (19.4%), 3p (16.1%), 4q (16.1%), 8p (25.8%), 9p (22.6%), 9q (29.0%), 10q (22.6%), 13q (22.6%), 16p (19.4%), 16q (22.6%), 17p (29.0%), 18q (16.1%), 19p (41.9%), 19q (32.3%), 20p (19.4%) and 22q (29%). These genomic changes were generally found consistent with previous reports of CGH analysis of primary tumors of lung adenocarcinoma. Loss of 19q and 22q were more frequently found in our studies (32.3% and 29.0%, respectively) than studies of primary tumors (less than 7% for both genetic changes). Gain of 11p, although not a frequent finding, was relatively more common in this (16%) than other studies (range, 2.9-11.8%). Interestingly, occurrences of 3p loss and 11p gain were higher in smokers than non-smokers, and deletion of 3p and increased copy number of 11p and Xp appeared more often in male than female patients. Among 17 male patients, gain of chromosomal 11p was a frequent aberration in tumors of smokers, while gain of Xp was more easily found in tumors of non-smokers. One candidate gene located within 11p15, lactate dehydrogenase C (LDHC), was selected for further study. Three cases with 11p gain had amplified FISH signals of LDHC. Also tumors from smokers or male had significantly higher transcript level of LDHC than non-smokers or female, respectively. The results demonstrate that different cytogenetic changes of malignant pleural effusions from lung adenocarcinoma are correlated with genders and smoking habits. The role of LDHC in the carcinogenesis of smoking-related lung adenocarcinoma, especially in male patients with pleural effusions, deserves further investigations. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

34548191793	Prognostic factors in resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer with a diameter of 3 cm or less: Visceral pleural invasion did not influence overall and disease-free survival	Objective: Resection is the treatment of choice for patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer. Stage I non-small cell lung cancer has been further subdivided into IA (T1N0M0, tumor size ≤ 3 cm without visceral pleural invasion) and IB (T2N0M0, tumor size > 3 cm or any size with visceral pleural invasion). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic factors in patients with resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer with a diameter of 3 cm or less. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic characteristics of 445 patients with resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer with a diameter of 3 cm or less who were treated at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 1980 and 2000. Disease-free survival, overall survival, and their predictors were analyzed. Results: The 5- and 10-year overall survivals were 61.4% and 40.0%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year disease-free survivals were 74.5% and 73.4%, respectively. Tumor size, smoking index, and number of mediastinal lymph nodes dissected were significant predictors for both disease-free survival (P = .009, P = .002, and P = .006, respectively) and overall survival (P = .004, P < .001, and P = .001, respectively) in multivariate analyses. Visceral pleural invasion did not influence overall survival or disease-free survival. Conclusions: Tumor size, smoking index, and number of mediastinal lymph nodes dissected were prognostic factors for both overall survival and disease-free survival in resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer with a diameter of 3 cm or less. Small tumors (<3 cm) of stage IB (T2N0M0) non-small cell lung cancer with visceral pleural invasion should be treated as T1 disease and not T2 disease. © 2007 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

36248931088	Effect of Formalin Fixation on Tumor Size Determination in Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	Background: Tumor size is an important prognostic factor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system does not mandate a specific measurement method. Moreover, measuring fresh specimens and formalin-fixed specimens may yield disparate results. Our goal was to evaluate this disparity for stage I NSCLC. Methods: We enrolled 401 patients with stage I NSCLC who underwent surgical interventions and follow-up in our hospital between 1993 and 2002. Tumors invading visceral pleura, involving the main bronchus, or associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis were excluded. Tumor size was measured immediately after resection by surgeons and after formalin fixation by pathologists. Patients were assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 included 201 patients with tumors of 3 cm or less as indicated by both operation notes and pathology reports. Group 2 included 160 patients with tumors larger than 3 cm by both records. Group 3 included 40 patients with tumors larger than 3 cm according to operation notes but 3 cm or less according to pathology reports. Survival rates were compared. Results: Mean follow-up was 58 months. Five-year survival was 70.1% in group 1, 49.1% in group 2, and 51.1% in group 3. As expected, there was a significant survival difference between groups 1 and 2 (p < 0.001); however, there was also a difference between groups 1 and 3 (p = 0.006). Conclusions: Formalin fixation may cause tumor shrinkage and migration from T2 to T1. For accurate tumor staging, size measurements should be performed immediately after resection instead of after formalin fixation. TNM staging should specify how to measure tumor size and the specimen status to be measured. © 2007 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

0032779237	Leiomyosarcoma of the gastric cardia and fundus	Background. Gastric leiomyosarcoma is rare among gastric malignancies, and only 20% of the cases are located in the gastric cardia or fundus. It has clinical manifestations different from tumors in other sites of the stomach. We reviewed cases of leiomyosarcoma of the gastric cardia or fundus to evaluate their clinicopathologic characters and patient survival. Methods. From May, 1981, to June, 1998, a total of 15 patients who underwent curative resection of leiomyosarcoma of the gastric cardia or fundus were retrospectively identified and studied. All the clinical and pathologic data were reviewed and recorded. Results. There were 11 men and four women. Their mean age was 59.1 years (range, 3773 years). Tarry stools and epigastric fullness and pain were the most common symptoms, followed by body weight loss. All 15 patients had submucosal tumors in the gastric cardia or fundus, as shown by endoscopy, barium contrast radiography and computerized tomography. The incidence of esophageal involvement by the tumors was quite low. The mean tumor size was 10 cm, ranging from 4 cm to 20 cm. Locoregional organs were involved in nine patients. The median and mean survivals were 17.8 months and 31.7 months, respectively (range, 10.1-80.1 months) after curative resection. The three-year and five-year survival rates were 53% and 22%, respectively. Conclusions. The definitive preoperative diagnosis of the tumor is difficult before surgery, even though imaging studies show positive findings. Surgical resection with an adequate safe margin of normal tissue is the treatment of choice. Tumor size, serosal invasion with locoregional organ involvement and high tumor grade were the prognostic factors in the study.

0032820117	Detection of Epstein-Barr virus in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Taiwan	OBJECTIVE: Recently, an association between viral infection and the development of esophageal carcinoma has been reported, particularly the human papilloma virus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, geographic variation in carcinogenesis is realized. In this study, we investigate the viral carcinogenesis and the biologic effect of viral infection on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in Taiwan. METHODS: To determine the association of viral infection (EBV and HPV) with ESCC, we applied polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization (ISH) to examine 119 surgical specimens from different sites of esophagus in 31 ESCC patients. Additionally, an immunoperoxidase method was used to detect EBV latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1), p53, CD45RO (UCHL-1), Fas ligand (Fas L), and RNA ISH with oligonucleotide sequences was used to detected interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA. RESULTS: By PCR, EBV DNA was detected in 11 cases (35.5%). Expression of EBERs in ESCC was further confirmed with ISH. Nonetheless, no LMP-1 expression was detected. On the other hand, human papillomavirus (HPV) was identified in only one case (3.2%) of ESCC. Furthermore, HPV was located by ISH in the distant normal region rather than in tumor cells. In EBV-positive cases, accumulation of p53 protein was detected in 10 lesions (91%); CD45RO

0034007146	Clinical significance of serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor-α in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Although the serum level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor α (sIL-2Rα) has been shown to correlate with progression and prognosis of several cancers, data to support its clinical significance to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) are limited. This study was conducted to assess the prognostic value and source of sIL-2Rα in patients with ESCC. From January 1986 to June 1997, 125 patients with histopathologically confirmed ESCC were enrolled for study. Ninety-three patients underwent en bloc esophagectomy, and 32 patients with unresectable tumor underwent palliative surgery. Four (4.3%; 4 of 93) patients died of surgical complications. Serum levels of sIL- 2Rα were measured by ELISA. Expression of IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, and IL-2Rγ in the pathological section was determined, respectively, by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH). Compared with the healthy control group (1020 ± 476 pg/ml, n = 103), ESCC patients tended to have significantly higher serum sIL-2Rα concentrations (1424 ± 798 pg/ml, n = 121). The sIL-2Rα level was correlated with age, Tumor-Node-Metastasis classification, tumor stage, reading score of the IHC staining, and survival but not with the pathological grade or lymphovascular invasion. Prognosis was worse for patients with high sIL-2Rα levels (≥1500 pg/ml) than for those with low serum sIL-2Rα levels (< 1500 pg/ml; P = 0.0209). It can be used as an independent prognostic factor of ESCC. In the pathological sections, expression of IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, and IL-2Rγ was detected in 17 (18.1%), 83 (89.2%), and 83 (89.2%) cases, respectively, by IHC, and the message of IL- 2Rα was identified in tumor cells by ISH in 30.1% (28 of 93) of the cases. Serum concentrations of sIL-2Rα are frequently elevated in ESCC patients and are correlated with disease progression and survival. These data indicate that, in addition to activated T cells, cancer cells could be an important source of sIL-2Rα in ESCC patients.

77954248313	Surgical Outcomes in Resected Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ≤ 1 cm in Diameter	Background: The goal of this study was to investigate the prognostic factors and patterns of recurrence in patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ≤ 1 cm in diameter. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of the clinicopathological characteristics of 71 patients with NSCLC ≤ 1 cm in diameter in Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 1982 and 2007. Overall survival and its predictors were analyzed. Results: Median follow-up time of the 71 patients was 33.3 months. Complete resection was performed in 68 patients (95.8%) with stage I disease. The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates of patients who underwent complete resections were 81.7% and 44.9%, respectively. There was tumor recurrence in 6 (8.8%) of these 68 patients. Five (9.3%) of 54 patients who underwent standard resection experienced tumor recurrence, but only 1 (7.1%) of 14 patients who received sublobar resection had recurrent disease. The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.569). Multivariate analysis revealed that sublobar resection (hazard ratio, 5.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-20.00; p = 0.020) was a significant predictor for worse overall survival. Conclusion: Survival in patients with NSCLC £ 1 cm in diameter is satisfactory. Sublobar resection, performed in patients unfit for standard resection, is a poor prognostic factor for overall survival. © 2010 Elsevier.

79951996218	Tumor length as a prognostic factor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Background: Tumor size is an important prognostic factor in many cancers, but its role in esophageal cancer remained undetermined. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of tumor length on survival for patients with resected esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Methods A total 582 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients underwent surgical resection as the primary treatment was enrolled into this retrospective review. The longitudinal tumor length was defined as a uniformly measurement from the surgeons in the operating room immediately after completion of the esophagectomy. The impact of tumor length on patient's overall survival was assessed and compared with the factors among the current tumor-nodes-metastasis (TNM) staging system published in 2009. Results The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 70.4%, 37.8%, and 30.0%, respectively, with a median for 22 months. The length adversely affected the overall survival, and the 5-year survival rate was 77.3%, 48.1%, 38.5%, and 23.3 % for tumor lengths of 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm, and more than 3 cm, respectively (p < 0.001). In multivariate survival analysis, tumor length (more or less than 3 cm) remained an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.020) as did the other current TNM factors. For subgroup analysis, the predictive value of tumor length was significant in patients with T1 or T2 disease (p < 0.001), T3 or T4 disease (p = 0.029), and patients with N0 disease (p < 0.001), but not for patients with N1, N2, or N3 disease. Conclusions Tumor length, which represents longitudinal spreading of the cancerous cells, could impact the overall survival of patients with resected esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, especially among those with nodal-negative disease. It may provide additional prognostic information to the current TNM staging system. © 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

84876796276	Gorham's Disease complicated with bilateral chylothorax and successfully treated with Interferon-alpha-2a	Gorham's disease (GD) is rare and characterized by non-neoplastic lymphovascular proliferation and massive osteolysis. Its clinical course is usually protracted, but sometimes life threatening when vital structures are involved or when complicated with chylothorax. There is no optimal treatment guideline for GD complicated with chylothorax. Surgical ligation of thoracic duct, pleurectomy, pleurodesis, interferon-alpha-2b, and radiotherapy, are reported to manage chylothorax. We present the case of a 32-year-old man with Gorham's disease complicated by bilateral chylothorax, which was refractory to radiotherapy but remitted dramatically two weeks after interferon-alpha-2a therapy. The patient was free of relapse four months after discontinuing four-month interferon therapy. To date, only 11 cases (including ours) of GD with chylothorax have received interferon as single or salvage therapy, and 10 of them survived. Early intervention with interferon therapy can be considered as an effective treatment for GD complicated with bilateral chylothorax. © 2012 Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

Methods: This was a retrospective review of patients who underwent extended thymectomy for treatment of MG. Results: From 1995 to 2010, 267 patients with MG underwent extended thymectomy, including 104 with thymomatous MG, 151 with non-thymomatous MG and 12 (4.4%) with thymolipoma. The mean duration of myasthenic symptoms before surgery was greatest in the thymolipomatous group (P < 0.001). The lowest mean age (36.1 years old, P < 0.001) and the lowest preoperative serum anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody titre (P = 0.015) occurred in the non-thymomatous group. More thymic and adipose tissue was removed from the thymolipomatous group compared with the non-thymomatous group (P < 0.001). Regarding surgical outcomes, the rate of stable remission was higher in the non-thymomatous (42.3%) and thymolipomatous (41.7%) groups compared with the thymomatous group (28.8%, P = 0.029). No instances of postoperative exacerbation of MG or tumour recurrence were noted during the postoperative follow-up of patients treated for thymolipoma. Conclusions: Our results suggest that patients with myasthenia thymolipomatous have surgical outcomes similar to those of patients with non-thymomatous MG and have a mean age at the time of surgery similar to that of patients with thymomatous MG. © The Author 2013.

41849122725	Dramatic remission of anemia after thymectomy in a patient of idiopathic myelofibrosis with thymoma	Anemia is one of the characteristics of idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), and malignant thymoma is usually associated with various hematologic disorders, including anemia, pancytopenia, and hypogammaglobulinemia. However, the relationship between IMF and malignant thymoma has not been published before. Here, we report a 48-year-old woman who was initially diagnosed of IMF with severe anemia and transfusion dependent. Five years later, malignant thymoma was found when she was examined for chronic cough. After performing extended thymectomy, her anemia dramatically recovered to normal and sustained for 2 years till last follow-up. Her splenomegaly and myelofibrosis were also improved. We hypothesized that her malignant thymoma induced the progression of IMF, especially in anemia. © 2007 The Japanese Society of Hematology.

4344590714	Effectiveness of short-term antibiotic prophylaxis on postoperative recovery course after pulmonary lobectomies	Background. Postoperative pneumonia is a major cause of mortality and morbidity after lung surgery. The effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics for preventing postoperative pneumonia and the recovery course after pulmonary lobectomy is still not clarified yet. We conducted this study to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics on the post-operative recovery course after pulmonary lobectomies. Methods. Forty-five cases undergoing pulmonary lobectomies between June 2002 and January 2003 were enrolled in this prospective study. Each patient received prophylactic antibiotics of cefuroxime and sisomicin. Sputum culture upon admission and swab culture from the bronchus cut-end during operation were obtained. The clinical vital signs including heart rates, respiratory rates and core body temperature in the postoperative recovery courses were analyzed. Results. Four (8.9%) patients developed pneumonia after lobectomies, and pneumonia occurred only in patients who had positive culture results from bronchial cut-end. The organisms cultured from the sputum seemed to be controlled by prophylactic antibiotics. All the organisms cultured in the bronchus cut-end differed from those in the sputum; it denoted these pathogens were inoculated during anesthesia for surgical operation. The postoperative vital signs including tachycardia and fever improved gradually in the initial 3 days. Patients with pneumonia sustained significant higher fever than the non-pneumonic patients during postoperative course. Conclusions. The short-term combination of cefuroxime and sisomicin offers sufficient effectiveness in prophylaxis of pneumonia after pulmonary surgery. Positive bronchial cut-end cultures were related to the post-lobectomy pneumonia significantly. Body temperature was the most useful presenting vital sign for early detection of the postoperative pneumonia.

54349110094	Bile acids induce CCN2 production through p38 MAP kinase activation in human bronchial epithelial cells: A factor contributing to airway fibrosis	Background and objective: Bile acid aspiration occurs in a variety of acute and chronic airway disorders. The consequence of bile acid aspiration and lung disease remains unclear. It was hypothesized that airway epithelium exposure to bile acids would induce fibrosis via production of connective tissue growth factor (CCN2), CCN2 is essential for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced fibrogenesis and functions as a downstream mediator of TGF-β action on fibroblasts. Methods: Human bronchial epithelial cells were grown on air-liquid interface culture inserts. Cells were stimulated with the major components of bile acids, chenodeoxycholic acid (CD) and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCD). RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR were used to detect mRNA expression. ELISA and western blotting were used to measure protein. Results: CD-stimulated airway epithelial cells produce CCN2 at both mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. GCD failed to increase CCN2 production. CCN2 expression occurred via activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and the downstream transcription factor ATF-2. Dexamethasone and the selective p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 successfully inhibited p38 MAP kinase, ATF-2 phosphorylation and subsequent CCN2 production. CD induced TGF-β

60749129023	Combination of microarray profiling and protein-protein interaction databases delineates the minimal discriminators as a metastasis network for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Microarray profiling of 15 adjacent normal/tumor-matched esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) specimens identified 40 up-regulated and 95 down-regulated genes. Verification of the microarray measurement by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR in the same set of samples as well as an additional 15 normal/tumor-matched samples revealed >95% consistency. These signatures can also be used to classify a recently reported ESCC microarray dataset. Moreover, these molecular signatures were used as templates to elucidate their corresponding protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks using the PPI databases, POINT and POINeT. As a result, 18 genes, of which six were not disclosed in the initial expression profile analysis, were found to be able to serve as the minimal discriminators for distinguishing ESCC tumors from normal specimens. Of these discriminators, ten (BGN, COL1A1, COL1A2, MMP9, CD44, FN1, TGFBI, PXN, SPARC and VWF) were associated with tumor metastasis and formed a highly interactive network with the first four molecules as 'hubs'. Our study not only reveals how novel insights can be obtained from gene expression profiling, but also highlights a group of highly interacting genes associated with metastasis in ESCC.

61649098205	Post-recurrence survival in completely resected stage i non-small cell lung cancer with local recurrence	Objective: Resection is the best treatment for patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Patterns of disease recurrence after complete resection in stage I NSCLC have not been well demonstrated, The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic predictors of post-recurrence survival in patients with resected stage I NSCLC with local recurrence. Methods: The clinicopathological characteristics of 123 patients with local recurrence after complete resection of stage I NSCLC in Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 1980 and 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. Post-recurrence survival and their predictors were analysed. Results: The patterns of local recurrence included local only in 74 (60.2%) and both local and distant in 49 (39.8%) patients, The 1 and 2 year post-recurrence survival rates for the 74 patients with local only recurrence were 48.7% and 17.6%, respectively. Tumour size (p = 0.033) and treatment for initial recurrence (p<0.001) were significant predictors for post-recurrence survival in 74 patients with local only recurrence in univariate analyses, The hazard of death was greater in patients with larger tumour size. Treatment for initial recurrence (p = 0.001) was still a significant prognostic indicator in multivariate analyses. Patients who underwent reoperation after local recurrence survived longer than those who received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy and those that received no treatment. Conclusions: Treatment for initial recurrence is a prognostic predictor for post-recurrence survival in resected stage I NSCLC with local recurrence, Complete surgical resection should be considered in selected candidates with resectable local recurrent disease.

62649104315	Prognostic Variables in Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma	Background: Thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (TESCC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. The current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM cancer staging system focusing on the effect of regional (N1) and nonregional lymph node (M1a and M1b) metastasis may need reappraisal. We investigated the role of the number of dissected and positive nodes in TESCC patients. Methods: A total of 109 TESCC patients (97 men; mean age of 62.3 years) who underwent surgical resection were retrospectively analyzed. The current AJCC TNM system and other lymph node classifications were used to subgroup these patients and analyze survival differences. Previously reported prognostic factors were evaluated. Results: Patients with positive lymph node metastasis had a poor prognosis (p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in survival among the 67 node-positive patients subdivided into subgroups with 1 to 3 and 4 or more positive nodes (p = 0.004). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified four independent prognostic factors: difficulty in swallowing (p = 0.024), cigarette smoking (p = 0.003), number of positive lymph nodes (0, 1 to 3, and ≥4; p < 0.001), and gastric cardia invasion (p = 0.012). Total dissection of at least 20 lymph nodes was the minimal requirement to achieve accurate nodal staging. Conclusions: Dissection of more than 20 lymph nodes is mandatory in TESCC patients to achieve accurate staging. Positive lymph node metastasis of 4 or higher is a significant independent prognostic factor. © 2009 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

64249100058	VEGFA upregulates FLJ10540 and modulates migration and invasion of lung cancer via PI3K/AKT pathway	Background: Lung adenocarcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among both men and women in the world. Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, the mortality rates with an overall 5-year survival of only 15%. This high mortality is probably attributable to early metastasis. Although several well-known markers correlated with poor/metastasis prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients by immunohistochemistry was reported, the molecular mechanisms of lung adenocarcinoma development are still not clear. To explore novel molecular markers and their signaling pathways will be crucial for aiding in treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Methodology/Principal Findings: To identify novel lung adenocarcinoma-associated/metastasis genes and to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms of these targets in lung cancer progression, we created a bioinformatics scheme consisting of integrating three gene expression profile datasets, including pairwise lung adenocarcinoma, secondary metastatic tumors vs. benign tumors, and a series of invasive cell lines. Among the novel targets identified, FLJ10540 was overexpressed in lung cancer tissues and is associated with cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, we employed two coexpression strategies to identify in which pathway FLJ10540 was involved. Lung adenocarcinoma array profiles and tissue microarray IHC staining data showed that FLJ10540 and VEGF-A, as well as FLJ10540 and phospho-AKT exhibit positive correlations, respectively. Stimulation of lung cancer cells with VEGF-A results in an increase in FLJ10540 protein expression and enhances complex formation with PI3K. Treatment with VEGFR2 and PI3K inhibitors affects cell migration and invasion by activating the PI3K/ AKT pathway. Moreover, knockdown of FLJ10540 destabilizes formation of the P110-α/P85-α-(PI3K) complex, further supporting the participation of FLJ10540 in the VEGF-A/PI3K/AKT pathway. Conclusions/Significance: This finding set the stage for further testing of FLJ10540 as a new therapeutic target for treating lung cancer and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies that are able to block the PI3K/AKT pathway in lung cancer cells. © 2009 Chen et al.

67650844458	Bile acid aspiration in suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia	Aims: The aims of this study were to measure the levels of bile acids in patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and provide a possible pathway for neutrophilic inflammation to explain its proinflammatory effect on the airway. Methods: Bile acid levels were measured by spectrophotometric enzymatic assay, and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was used to quantify the major bile acids. Alveolar cells were grown on modified air-liquid interface culture inserts, and bile acids were then employed to stimulate the cells. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blots were used to determine the involved gene expression and protein levels. Results: The mean (± SE) concentration of total bile acids in tracheal aspirates was 6.2 ± 2.1 and 1.1 ± 0.4 μmol/L/g sputum, respectively, for patients with and without VAP (p < 0.05). The interleukin (IL)-8 level was significantly higher in the VAP group (p < 0.05). The major bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, stimulated alveolar epithelial cells to increase IL-8 production at both the messenger RNA and protein level through p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. The selective p38 and JNK inhibitors, as well as dexamethasone, successfully inhibited IL-8 production. Conclusion: These data suggest that early intervention to prevent bile acid aspiration may reduce the intensity of neutrophilic inflammation in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU.

69049119236	Pulmonary sclerosing haemangioma mimicking lung cancer on PET scan	Sclerosing haemangioma is an uncommon lung tumour that typically presents as a solitary, peripheral pulmonary nodule in the lower lobe. Little is known of the appearance of these tumours on FDG-PET scan. We report two patients with sclerosing haemangioma with increased uptake on FDG-PET scan, which complicated the preoperative work-up. Although the CT scan features of these two masses were compatible with the differential diagnosis of sclerosing haemangioma, the central location and increased uptake on FDG-PET scan raised the suspicion of malignancy. We conclude that centrally located large sclerosing haemangiomas may be avid on FDG-PET scan, and that familiarity with this false positive finding helps in the diagnosis of a solitary pulmonary nodule. © 2009 The Authors.

70449359177	Identification of chromosomal aberrations associated with disease progression and a novel 3q13.31 deletion involving LSAMP gene in osteosarcoma	Five osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines, 37 OS tumors and 9 corresponding non-neoplastic samples were genotyped by Affymetrix 10 K 2.0 SNP array. Regions of high level amplification and homozygous deletion were identified and validated by quantitative PCR and FISH. Certain recurrent cytogenetic alterations were more frequent in recurrent/ metastatic than in primary OS. These included deletion of 6q14.1, 6q16.2-q22.31, and 8p23.2-p12, amplification of 8q21.12, 8q22.3-q24.3 and 17p12, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 2q24.3-q31.2, 5q11.2, 6p21.31-p21.1, 6q14.1-q16.2, 8p22-p12, 9q22.1, 10q21.1-q22.1, 10q23.31-q24.1, 12q15-q21.1 and 21q21.2-q21.3. Most of the LOH calls were associated with deletion, but a subset of them was associated with normal or increased copy number (CN). A consensus 3q13.31 deletion localized to a region within the limbic system-associated membrane protein (LSAMP) gene was also identified. The FISH evaluations demonstrated highly-localized homozygous or heterozygous LSAMP deletions in 6 of 11 primary OS. qRT-PCR evaluations of the two major alternative LSAMP transcripts demonstrated reduced expression of 1b isoform transcript in each of three OS with LSAMP exon 1b deletion. Further, the 1a isoform transcripts in these same OS had either reduced expression or a premature termination codon in LSAMP exon 2. This SNP genotyping study identified chromosomal aberrations associated with disease progression in OS and disclosed LSAMP as a novel tumor suppressor gene in OS. The study also demonstrated that CN and LOH analyses were able to detect distinct subsets of genetic abnormalities in OS.

73149096510	The role of mitochondrial DNA alterations in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas	Objective: The study objective was to evaluate the roles of mitochondrial DNA alterations in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, with emphasis on the changes in the copy number and D310 variants of mitochondrial DNA. Methods: Paired samples microdissected from esophageal muscles, noncancerous esophageal mucosa, cancerous esophageal squamous cell carcinoma nests, and metastatic lymph nodes of 72 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were subjected to DNA extraction. The copy number and D310 variants of mitochondrial DNA were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing, respectively. Results: Fifty-six patients (77.8%) with somatic D310 mutations had lower survival probability (P = .027). From noncancerous esophageal mucosa to cancerous esophageal squamous cell carcinoma nests and metastatic lymph nodes, the D310 variants were decreased from 2.2 to 1.7 and 1.5, respectively, with a trend to homoplasmy (P = .0009). Concurrently, the mitochondrial DNA copy number was increased from 0.159 to 0.192 and 0.206, respectively, (P = .024), especially in cigarette smokers (P = .014) and heavy wine drinkers (P = .005). Notably, a decrease in D310 variants (1.5, P < .001) and an increase in the incidence of the homoplasmic D310 pattern (P = .005) were observed in the matched esophageal muscle tissues. Among the 56 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cancer nests with somatic D310 mutations, 51 (91.1%) had D310 variants in association with their corresponding noncancerous esophageal mucosa, including 36 (64.3%) fully related and 15 (26.8%) partially related pairs. Conclusion: We demonstrated that somatic D310 mutations and increase in the copy number of mitochondrial DNA are of clinical importance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. We also propose a model of DNA instability and clonal expansion during the carcinogenesis and progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma from the viewpoint of mitochondrial DNA transmission. © 2010 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

77949822144	Prognostic factors of postrecurrence survival in completely resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer with distant metastasis	Objective: Distant metastasis after surgical resection is the most frequent cause of death in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to investigate the patterns of distant metastasis and the prognostic factors of postrecurrence survival in patients with resected stage I NSCLC with distant metastases. Methods: The clinicopathological characteristics of 166 patients with distant metastases after complete resection of stage I NSCLC at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 1980 and 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups according to patterns of distant metastasis (single or multiple organ metastases). Predictors of postrecurrence survival were analysed. Results: The patterns of distant metastasis included single organ metastasis in 106 (63.9%) and multiple organ metastases in 60 (36.1%) patients. The 1- and 2-year postrecurrence survival rates for those with single organ metastasis were 30.2% and 15.1%, respectively. The most common site of single organ metastasis was bone (32.1%), followed by the brain (29.2%). Multivariate analysis revealed that disease-free interval >16 months (HR 0.534; 95% CI 0.288 to 0.990; p=0.046) and treatment for distant metastasis (including re-operation, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) (HR 0.245; 95% CI 0.089 to 0.673; p=0.006) were significant predictors of better postrecurrence survival in resected stage I NSCLC with single organ metastasis. Conclusions: A longer disease-free interval is a favourable prognostic predictor for postrecurrence survival in resected stage I NSCLC with single organ metastasis. Treatment for distant metastasis significantly prolongs postrecurrence survival.

77952980300	The metastatic lymph node number and ratio are independent prognostic factors in esophageal cancer	Objective The current American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for esophageal cancer is based on lymph node location, irrespective of the number of involved and examined lymph nodes. Methods We enrolled 488 patients receiving primary curative resection without neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer between 1995 and 2006. The importance of total resected lymph node number (TLN) and metastatic lymph node number (MLN) and ratio (MLR) on patient survival was investigated. Results The overall 3-year survival rate was 35.4%. The 3-year survival rate was equivalent among patients in N1 (23.3%), M1a (22.0%), and nonregional lymph node metastasis-related M1b (18.5%, p=0.321). No survival difference was noted between patients with TLN<15 or ≥15 (p=0.249). Both MLN and MLR significantly predicted patient survival. The 3-year survival rate was 52.3%, 29.2%, and 8.0% for patients with MLN=0, 1-3, and ≥4, respectively (p<0.001). For patients with MLR=0-0.2 or >0.2, the 3-year survival rate was 28.7% and 9.8%, respectively (p<0.001). However, survival rate differences were more evident when TLN was more than 15. Conclusions We recommend designating both regional and nonregional lymph nodes as N nodes. MLN and MLR, but not TLN, are prognostic factors in esophageal cancer. © 2009 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.

77954451868	Anti-α-enolase autoantibodies are down-regulated in advanced cancer patients	Objective: Elevation of serum autoantibodies to a-enolase (ENO1) is often seen in inflammation diseases. However, it is unclear whether the levels of serum ENO1 autoantibodies could be affected during tumor progression. Hence, we attempted to determine the relative serum ENO1 autoantibody levels in healthy individuals and various stages of patients with lung and breast cancers. Methods: Sera were obtained from 99 normal individuals, 21 patients with non-cancerassociated diseases and 178 cancer patients, including Stage I, II and IV non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. The ENO1 autoantibody levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Compared with the healthy individuals, the levels of ENO1 autoantibodies were significantly decreased in Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer and breast cancer patients. Consistently, this phenomenon was also observed in tumor-grafted mice. Using logistic regression analyses, data show that the titer status of ENO1 autoantibody level is highly associated with the late stage of lung and breast cancers when compared with those of healthy controls. In contrast, there were no statistic differences between healthy controls and early stages of non-small cell lung cancer patients, and total amounts of serum immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M levels in Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer patients were not significantly distinct from those of the healthy controls. Thus, the decreased ENO1 autoantibody event in malignant stage of cancer patients is not contributed by reduction in total immunoglobulin. Conclusions: Marked decrease in the basal level of serum ENO1 autoantibodies is a common malignant event of lung and breast cancers, suggesting that ENO1 autoantibody may serve as a prognostic marker to monitor the disease progression of these cancer patients. © The Author (2010).

77954958028	Soft tissue sarcoma of extremities: The prognostic significance of adequate surgical margins in primary operation and reoperation after recurrence	Background: Adult soft tissue sarcomas (STS) of extremities are prone to recurrence despite apparently complete resection. This study aimed to explore the impact of clinicopathological factors on outcome and to define an "oncological safe margin" in these patients. Methods: A total of 181 patients with extremity STS were enrolled in a retrospective study. The prognostic influence of margin status and other clinicopathological characteristics on local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS), were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses. The influence of surgical margins on postrecurrence survival (PRS) of patients undergoing reoperation for relapsed lesions during follow-up was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Surgical margin width <10 mm and deep tumor depth at primary operation were consistently statistically significant independent adverse factors for LRFS, DMFS, and DSS. Patients with liposarcoma or low grade tumors had significantly higher chances of achieving adequate margins. Of 83 patients who experienced recurrence or metastasis, 53 (63.9%) received reoperation for their relapsed lesions. Patients who achieved microscopically negative margins (R0) at reoperation had significantly better PRS than those who did not (P < 0.007). Overall, patients with no recurrences had the best DSS, while relapsed patients receiving R0 reoperation had better DSS than those receiving either non-R0 reoperation or no reoperation at all. Conclusion: Surgical margins prognostically influence survival in both patients undergoing primary surgery and those undergoing reoperation for relapse of extremity STS. In primary surgery, the chance of achieving adequate margin may reflect the underlying aggressiveness of tumors. © Society of Surgical Oncology 2010.

77955094398	Co-overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin e Synthase-1 adversely affects the postoperative survival in non-small cell lung cancer	Introduction: Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES)-1 have been found to be overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study was to investigate the expression profiles of COX-2 and mPGES-1 and their correlation with the clinical characteristics and survival outcomes in patients with resected NSCLC. Methods/Results: Seventy-nine paired adjacent normal-tumor matched samples were prospectively procured from patients undergoing surgery for NSCLC. The protein levels of COX-2 and mPGES-1 were assessed by Western blot analysis. Overexpression in the tumor sample was defined as more than twofold increase in protein expression compared with the corresponding adjacent normal tissue. Co-overexpression of COX-2 and mPGES-1 were further confirmed by immunohistochemistry. COX-2 was overexpressed in 58% and mPGES-1 in 70% of the tumor samples (p < 0.0001). Co-overexpression of mPGES-1 and COX-2 was noted in 43%, and they were unrelated to each other (p = 0.232). Co-overexpression of both proteins was significantly associated with less tumor differentiation (p = 0.046), tumor size larger than 5 cm (p = 0.038), and worse survival status during the follow-up (p = 0.036). Multivariate analysis showed that in addition to overall stage, co-overexpression of both proteins adversely affected the overall (hazard ratio, 2.40; p = 0.045) and disease-free survivals (hazard ratio, 2.27; p = 0.029). Conclusions: Overexpression of either COX-2 or mPGES-1 is common but unrelated in NSCLC. Co-overexpression of both COX-2 and mPGES-1 adversely affects postoperative overall and disease-free survivals. © 2010 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

78649760332	Prognostic factors in pathological stage IB nonsmall cell lung cancer greater than 3 cm	Significant heterogenity of stage IB (sixth edition of the TNM staging system) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been identified, and further subclassification according to tumour size has been proposed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic factors in patients with resected stage IB NSCLC >3 cm. From January 1980 to December 2000, 525 patients underwent surgical resection for stage IB NSCLC >3 cm at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. The clinicopathological characteristics of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. The 5- and 10-yr overall survival rates were 44.9% and 27.3%, respectively. Age (p<0.001), tumour size (p50.002), extent of pulmonary resection (p=0.002), histological type (p=0.005) and number of mediastinal lymph nodes dissected/sampled (p=0.004) were significant predictors for overall survival in multivariate analysis. Patients with tumour size >7 cm, or .5 to ≤7 cm, had a worse survival than those with tumour size >3 to ≤5 cm. However, visceral pleural invasion did not influence overall survival. Stage IB NSCLC with a diameter >3 cm may be subclassified according to tumour size regardless of visceral pleural invasion. Copyright©ERS 2010.

79952615438	The total number of resected lymph node is not a prognostic factor for recurrence in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients undergone transthoracic esophagectomy	Background: The total number of resected lymph nodes (TLN) has been shown to predict survival in esophageal cancer, but its relationship with recurrence has been rarely reported. We aim to study the prognostic factors in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients, with a particular focus on the role of TLN. Methods: Two hundred sixty-eight ESCC patients who underwent transthoracic esophagectomy were selected for the study. A Cox regression model was used to identify prognostic factors. Results: Recurrence occurred in 115 of 268 patients. The median time to recurrence was 10 months (range, 1-58). The recurrence-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 62.3%, 32.1%, and 28.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified age (P = 0.001), N stage (N1-3 vs. N0, P = 0.001), tumor length (P = 0.019), and development of recurrence (P < 0.001) as independent prognostic factors for overall survival, whereas T (T3/4 vs. T1/2, P = 0.029) and N stage (N1-3 vs. N0, P = 0.017) were independent prognostic factors for recurrence. TLN was a significant factor only when predicting overall survival in N0 patients (HR, 0.976; 95% CI, 0.953-0.999; P = 0.042). Conclusion: The TLN is not a prognostic factor for recurrence in ESCC patients undergone transthoracic esophagectomy. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

79953088246	Prognostic Factors for Post-recurrence Survival in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients with Recurrence after Resection	Objective: The survival of recurrent esophageal cancer is poor. But reports regarding prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival are limited. We analyzed the recurrence pattern and the prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with recurrence after resection. Methods: Two hundred sixty-eight patients were included. Tumor recurrence occurred in 115 (42.9%) patients. Recurrence pattern was classified as locoregional, distant, and combined recurrence. The post-recurrence survival was defined as the interval between initial recurrence and either death or the last follow-up. Results: Mediastinum lymphadenopathy was the most common site for locoregional recurrence, whereas lung, liver, and bone were the most common sites for distant recurrence. The overall 1- and 2-year post-recurrence survival rates were 32.6% and 12.6% with a median survival after recurrence of 6.0 months. The independent prognostic factors included liver recurrence (HR = 2.255, 95%CI = 1.073-4.741, p = 0.032), time to recurrence ≤10 months (HR = 2.657, 95%CI = 1.438-4. 911, p = 0.002), and no treatment for recurrences (HR = 2.745, 95%CI = 1.635-4.608, p < 0.001). Conclusions: We identify liver recurrence, early recurrence, and no treatment for recurrence as risk factors for dismal post-recurrence survival. © 2011 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.

79955691003	PML protein as a prognostic molecular marker for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinomas receiving primary surgery	Background and Objectives We evaluated the clinicopathological associations and prognostic implications of promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) expressions in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) receiving primary surgery. Methods Expression patterns of PML and tumor protein 53 (TP53) of 132 cases of ESCC were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinicopathological parameters. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the prognostic influence of clinicopathological factors on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results Forty-two cases (31.82%) were classified as lost expression of PML, 25 (18.94%) as focally positive, and 65 (49.24%) as diffusely expressed. Sixty-three cases (47.73%) were classified as over-expression of TP53. High expression of TP53 and down-regulation of PML were often found in advanced disease; and, in together with high pathological staging, grading, and positive margin, were associated with poor survival. However, only tumor differentiation (P=0.016), distant metastasis (P=0.001), and PML expression (P=0.001) could act as independent prognostic factors for PFS, and LN metastasis (P=0.004), TP53 (P=0.006), and PML expression (P=0.029) were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Our study demonstrated PML protein as an independent prognostic marker for patients with ESCC receiving primary surgery. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

79955710573	Rad is a p53 direct transcriptional target that inhibits cell migration and is frequently silenced in lung carcinoma cells	The p53 tumor suppressor exerts its function mainly as a transcriptional activator. Here we show that the Ras-related small GTPase Rad, an inhibitor of Rho kinase, is a direct transcriptional target of p53. Expression of Rad messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was induced by DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. The -2934/-2905-bp Rad promoter region, to which p53 bound, was required for p53-mediated Rad gene activation. Treatment by DNA damaging agents increased p53 occupancy and histone acetylation in the region of Rad promoter containing the p53-binding site. Expression of Rad diminished the inhibitory phosphorylation at Ser3 of cofilin, a regulator of actin dynamics, and suppressed migration and invasiveness of cancer cells. Knockdown of Rad promoted cell migration and alleviated the p53-mediated migration suppression. Frequent loss of Rad mRNA and protein expression was observed in non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues. Together our results reveal a mechanism that p53 may inhibit cell migration by disrupting actin dynamics via Rad activation and implicate a tumor suppressor role of Rad in lung cancer. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

79956039237	Preoperative positron emission tomography/computed tomography predicts advanced Lymph node metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients	Background: We aimed to study whether positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) findings are associated with lymph node staging, as outlined by the 7th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: A series of 76 ESCC patients undergoing esophagectomy were included in this study. The relation between PET/CT findings [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax)] and pathologic lymph node status (N stage) was studied. Results: The SUVmax of extra-tumor uptake, but not that of the main tumor, was significantly associated with the N classification. N2/N3 disease was observed in 61.1% of patients with an SUVmax for extra-tumor uptake of >4.9, whereas only 17.2% of patients with an SUVmax of extra-tumor uptake of <4.9 were classified as N2/N3 The number of PET abnormalities (NPAs) was also significantly associated with the N classification. Patients with three or more NPAs had a 65% chance of being classified as N2/N3, whereas patients with one or two NPAs had less than a 20% chance of being classified as N2/N3. Conclusions: The SUVmax of extra-tumor uptake and the NPAs were significantly associated with the N classification outlined by the 7th edition of the AJCC TNM staging system. PET/CT does help identify patients with advanced lymph node metastasis (N2/N3 stage) instead of simply indicating nodal involvement. © 2011 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.

0036094618	Pulmonary resection for metastases from colorectal adenocarcinomas	Background. Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in Taiwan, as in the other part of the world. Surgical intervention is the best treatment of choice, yet some patients still developed distant metastasis after primary lesions were controlled. Metastasectomy is reported to improve the survival. This retrospective study was carried out to evaluate the relationship between the prognostic factors of lung metastasectomy and patient survival. Methods. From 1981 to 2000, 68 patients undergoing complete lung metastasectomy in our section were studied. The prognostic factors influencing survival were analyzed, and the survival analysis was made with Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test. Results. There was no surgical mortality in our series. The 5-year survival was 36.1%. None of parameters such as age, sex, stage of primary colorectal cancer, surgical method, size, number of metastatic deposits and disease free interval showed to relate with the survival. Conclusions. We concluded that lung metastasectomy for colorectal cancer is safe and effective to improve the survival. Since there were no significant factors influencing the survival, there should be no absolute contraindication against resectable pulmonary metastasis after primary lesions were adequately controlled.

0036205926	Primary thymic carcinoma	Background. Thymic carcinoma is a malignancy of the anterior mediastinum, always with poor prognosis. Up to the present, very few articles have discussed and evaluated either the clinical or pathologic features or treatments of this tumor. Therefore, we are in a position to analyze our research data to support our belief as follows. Methods. From January 1977 until December 1997, we received 614 patients who were diagnosed with anterior mediastinal tumors. Of the 614 patients, 38 patients (6.2%) were diagnosed with thymic carcinoma, including 26 men and 12 women. Data were collected from clinical records and personal interviews with the patients. Classification of these patients' tumor stages was based on the Masaoka staging system. Results. We proceeded with surgery for 15 of the 38 patients to remove their tumors. Complete resection was done in 8 of these 15 patients (21.0%), whereas debulking was done in the other 7 (18.4%) patients. The mean survival time of all the patients in this study (excluding 3 patients who were lost to follow-up) was 53.0 months, with a median of 24.1 months. The overall cumulative survival rate was 38.6% at 3 years and 27.5% at 5 years. The data in this research show that tumor grading (p = 0.01), resectability (p = 0.02), and stage (p = 0.04) have statistically significant influence on patients' survival. Conclusions. The grade, stage, and resectability of the tumor are decisive factors of the effectiveness of either surgery or chemo/radiotherapies in the treatment of thymic carcinoma. © 2002 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

0036207397	Effects of platelet activating factor, butyrate and interleukin-6 on cyclooxygenase-2 expression in human esophageal cancer cells	Background: Epidemiological studies have indicated that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by taking cyclooxygenase (COX) as the target enzyme. The pathophysiological regulation of COX-2 may play a role in carcinogenesis and in disease progression of esophageal carcinoma. Methods: 59 ESCC samples were used to assess COX-2 expression in the tumor cells and four ESCC cell lines to investigate the effects of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), platelet activating factor (PAF), n-sodium butyrate (n-BT) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) on the expression of COX-2.

79958097982	The novel protein suppressed in lung cancer down-regulated in lung cancer tissues retards cell proliferation and inhibits the oncokinase aurora-A	Introduction: In an attempt to search for genes with abnormal expression in cancers, Suppressed in Lung Cancer (SLAN, also known as KIAA0256) is found underexpressed in human lung cancer tissues by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR). The study set out to characterize SLAN protein and explore its cellular functions. Methods: SLAN or its specific short hairpin RNA, full length or various deletion mutants were overexpressed in 293T or lung cancer cell lines, and cell proliferation, cell cycle, mitosis progression, and spindle configuration were surveyed. Results: SLAN and its deletion mutants are localized to many subcellular locations such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER), nucleus, nucleolus, spindle pole and midbody, suggesting SLAN may function as a multifunctional protein. Overexpression of SLAN per se or its short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) inhibits or accelerates cell proliferation through prolonging or shortening mitosis. Time-lapse microscopic recording reveals that cells overexpressing exogenous SLAN are arrested in mitosis or cannot undergo cytokinesis. SLAN 2-551 mutants drastically arrest cells in mitosis, where α- and γ-tubulin are disorganized. SLAN employs C-terminal to interact with Aurora-A, a key mitosis regulator and an oncogenic kinase associated with a wide range of human cancers. SLAN negatively regulates the activity of Aurora-A by directly inhibiting kinase activity in vitro or reducing the level of active Aurora-A in cells. SLAN is frequently reduced in lung cancer tissues overexpressing Aurora-A, arguing for the necessity to suppress SLAN during the Aurora-A-associated cancer formation. Conclusions: Taken together, we have identified a novel protein SLAN downregulated in lung caner, having multiple subcellular localization including spindle matrix and midbody, inhibiting cell proliferation and Aurora-A.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of the clinicopathologic characteristics of NSCLC patients with unexpected pleural spread at thoracotomy in Taipei Veterans General Hospital between January 1990 and December 2008. Inclusion criteria were patients with frozen section of pleural nodules identified as metastatic carcinoma during operation. A survival analysis was done. Results: There were 138 patients included in this study. The median follow-up time was 19.9 mo. The overall 1, 3, and 5-year survival rates were 72.9%, 26.8%, and 16.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that main tumor resection and mediastinal lymph nodal involvement (P < 0.001 and 0.002, respectively) were significant predictors for overall survival rate. Patients who underwent main tumor resection and those without mediastinal lymph node metastasis had better outcomes. Conclusions: Among the unexpected pleural spread detected at thoracotomy, limited pulmonary resection was an alternative surgical procedure for these patients without mediastinal nodal metastasis. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79960700661	A novel exon 15-deleted, splicing variant of Slit2 shows potential for growth inhibition in addition to invasion inhibition in lung cancer	BACKGROUND: The axon guidance cue molecule Slit2 has been shown to suppress cancer cell invasion. However, the role of Slit2 in growth inhibition is still controversial. The authors identified a novel exon 15 (AKEQYFIP)-deleted slit2, located at the end of the second leucine-rich repeat (LRR2). Because LRR2 interacts with Robo1 receptor to inhibit invasion, they hypothesized that exon 15 plays an important role in modulating Slit2 function. METHODS: Slit2 expression was assessed via microarray analysis in 27 lung adenocarcinomas. Exon 15-deleted slit2 (slit2-ΔE15) and exon 15-containing slit2 (slit2-WT) were cloned and expressed in the CL1-5 lung cancer cell line. The effect of exon 15 on Slit2-mediated cell growth was evaluated by a xenografted model and in vitro cell growth assays. The effect of exon 15 on Slit2-mediated invasion was analyzed with a modified Boyden chamber in vitro. RESULTS: Tumor growth from CL1-5/Slit2-WT cells was comparable to that from CL1-5 cells bearing empty vector. However, tumor size from CL1-5/Slit2-ΔE15 cells was much smaller than that from Slit2-WT cells or vector control cells in the xenografted model. In vitro analyses demonstrated that Slit2-WT inhibits invasion of CL1-5 cells. In addition to inhibiting invasion, Slit2-ΔE15 greatly suppresses cell growth. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrated that exon 15 modulates Slit2 function in growth inhibition of lung cancer cells. Because slit2-ΔE15 splice variant is present in low invasive cancer cells and nontumor lung tissues, loss of this splice variant is an important event in tumor progression and invasion. © 2011 American Cancer Society.

80255132751	Brain, the last fortress of sarcoma: Similar dismal outcome but discrepancy of timing of brain metastasis in bone and soft tissue sarcoma	Background and Objective Brain metastasis is a rare but dismal event in sarcomas. However, the pattern of occurrence and the prognostic factors associated with post-brain metastasis survival (PBMS) are not yet well-characterized. Methods Sarcoma patients treated at one institute within 10-year period were retrospectively reviewed and those with brain metastasis were identified. The incidence of brain metastasis was demonstrated by case per person-years and cumulative incidence curves. Univariate factors associated with PBMS were analyzed. Results Among 611 sarcoma patients, 20 (3.3%) developed brain metastasis. Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) and osteosarcoma were the most common subtypes. Overall, the cumulative incidence was 3.9% at 5 years and 8.4% at 10 years. However, the incidence in STS patients continued to rise up to 10 years after primary diagnosis, whereas it reached a plateau in bone sarcoma patients at 3 years. Median PBMS was 1.67 months. Univariate factors associated with better PBMS included ASPS histology, initial surgical treatment, and brain irradiation for non-surgically treated patients. Conclusion Our study revealed a discrepancy in the timing of occurrence of brain metastasis between STS and bone sarcoma. However, patients with brain metastasis had a poor prognosis, implicating the brain as the last fortress of sarcoma. J. Surg. Oncol. 2011; 104:765-770. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84858338942	Time trends of overall survival and survival after recurrence in completely resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer	Introduction: The seventh edition of the tumor, node, metastasis classification for lung cancer has been published in 2009. The aim of this study is to evaluate time trends of surgical outcomes and clinicopathologic factors in patients with pathological stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer according to the seventh edition of the tumor, node, metastasis classification. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic characteristics of 1249 patients with pathological stage I non-small cell lung cancer from Taipei Veterans General Hospital between January 1980 and December 2006, during the three periods of 1980-1990, 1991-2000, and 2001-2006. The overall survival, disease-specific survival, and postrecurrence survival were analyzed. Results: The 5-year overall survival rates during the three periods improved significantly: 53.7, 59.9, and 69.3%, respectively (p < 0.001). The 2-year postrecurrence survival rates during the three periods improved significantly: 10.6, 25.4, and 43.2%, respectively (p < 0.001). The percentage of female patients increased during each period: 15.4, 24.9, and 32.0%, respectively (p < 0.001). The percentage of adenocarcinoma also increased during each period: 51.2, 62.2, and 74.9%, respectively (p < 0.001). Tumor size during each period was 3.2, 3.2, and 2.8 cm, tending to be smaller when diagnosed in the last period (p < 0.001). The overall survival in patients with squamous cell carcinoma and those undergoing pneumonectomy or bilobectomy did not improve over time. Conclusions: Stage migration, improved postrecurrence survival, increased frequencies of female gender and adenocarcinoma, and decreased tumor size lead to improved overall survival over the past three decades.

To delineate the role of TOPK in lung cancer, we showed that overexpression of TOPK, but not a catalytically inactive form of TOPK, can enhance the migration and invasion of lung fibroblasts or cells with low TOPK expression. In addition, TOPK-induced cell migration was shown to be a PI3K/AKT-dependent event. TOPK concurrently promoted AKT phosphorylation at Ser

84862809389	Overexpression of T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase predicts poor prognosis in patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma	Tumor recurrence is the most common cause of disease failure after surgical resection in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma. Identification of clinically relevant prognostic markers could help to predict patients with high risk of disease recurrence. A meta-analysis of available lung adenocarcinoma microarray datasets revealed that T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), a serine/threonine protein kinase, is overexpressed in lung cancer. Using stable cell lines with overexpression or knockdown of TOPK, we have shown that TOPK can promote cell migration, invasion, and clonogenic activity in lung cancer cells, suggesting its crucial role in lung tumorigenesis. To evaluate the prognostic value of TOPK expression in resected stage I lung adenocarcinoma, a retrospective analysis of 203 patients diagnosed with pathological stage I lung adenocarcinoma was carried out to examine the expression of TOPK by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The prognostic significance of TOPK overexpression was examined. Overexpression of TOPK (IHC score >3) was detected in 67.0% of patients, and these patients were more frequently characterized with disease recurrence and angiolymphatic invasion. Using multivariate analysis, patient age (>65 years old; P = 0.002) and TOPK overexpression (IHC score >3; P < 0.001) significantly predicted a shortened overall survival. Moreover, TOPK overexpression (IHC score >3; P = 0.005) also significantly predicted a reduced time to recurrence in the patients. Our results indicate that overexpression of TOPK could predetermine the metastatic capability of tumors and could serve as a significant prognostic predictor of shortened overall survival and time to recurrence. © 2011 Japanese Cancer Association.

84862879720	Predictors of death, local recurrence, and distant metastasis in completely resected pathological stage-I non-small-cell lung cancer	OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the factors predicting recurrence and death in patients with resected stage-I non-small-cell lung cancers according to the 7th edition of tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification for lung cancer. METHODS: All patients undergoing surgical resection for pathological stage-I non-small-cell lung cancers at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 1980 and 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. Those undergoing sublobar resection were excluded. The factors predicting overall survival (OS), overall recurrence, local recurrence, and distant metastasis were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 756 patients were eligible. The 5-year OS rate and probability of freedom from recurrence were 57.3% and 70.2%, respectively. The 2-year local-recurrence-free and distant-metastasis-free rates were 90.7% and 82.1%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, the new T descriptor (T1a, T1b, and T2a) was the common factor that significantly affected OS (p = 0.003), overall recurrence (p = 0.004), and distant metastasis (p < 0.001). Smoking index more than 20, and number of mediastinal lymph nodes dissected/sampled of 15 or fewer were common factors that significantly predicted worse OS (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively), lower probability of freedom from overall recurrence (p = 0.025, p = 0.009, respectively), and higher risk of local recurrence (p < 0.001, p = 0.030, respectively). Non-squamous-cell histology predicted higher risk of distant metastasis (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Risks of death and recurrence increase as the T descriptor upgrades in the new TNM system. The combination of risk factors can be used to identify high-risk subgroups of local recurrence and distant metastasis.

84863722236	Follow-up after primary treatment of soft tissue sarcoma of extremities: Impact of frequency of follow-up imaging on disease-specific survival	Background and Objectives: We explored the impact of frequency of surveillance imaging on disease-specific survival (DSS) in patients with extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Methods: Locoregional imaging (LRI) and chest imaging (CI) were used to detect local recurrence (LR) and distant metastasis (DM), respectively. Relapsing patients were retrospectively assigned to more frequent surveillance (MFS) or less frequent surveillance (LFS) groups, according to the median interval for each follow-up modality. Outcome measures included overall DSS (O-DSS), post-LR DSS, and post-DM DSS. Results: We assigned 165 patients to three distinct risk groups according to tumor size (≤5 vs. >cm), depth (superficial- vs. deep-seated), grade (I vs. II or III), and surgical margin (≥10 vs. <mm). Data for 80 patients who relapsed were analyzed. Among 50 high-risk (with all four risk factors) relapsing patients, those in the MFS group for either LRI or CI had better O-DSS (LRI, median 44.07 vs. 27.43 months, P=0.008 CI, median 43.60 vs. 36.93 months, P=0.036), post-LR DSS (median 27.20 vs. 10.63 months, P=0.028) and post-DM DSS (median 13.20 vs. 6.24 months, P=0.031). Conclusion: More frequent follow-up were associated with improved survival in high-risk relapsing patients with extremity STS by providing greater opportunities for adequate reoperation.

84863806232	Prognostic significance of the extent of visceral pleural invasion in completely resected node-negative non-small cell lung cancer	Objective: Visceral pleural invasion(VPI) has been defined as invasion of the tumor beyond the elastic layer(PL1), including invasion to the visceral pleural surface(PL2). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic factors and patterns of recurrence in resected node-negative nonsmall cell lung cancer(NSCLC) with VPI. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic characteristics of 355 patients with resected node-negative NSCLC with VPI at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 1990 and 2006. The prognostic value and patterns of recurrence were analyzed and compared between PL1 and PL2 groups. Results: The median follow-up time was 54.2 months. The 5-year overall survival rate and probability of freedom from recurrence were 61.9% and 66.2%, respectively. The extent of VPI was PL1 in 300 patients (84.5%) and PL2 in 55 (15.5%). During follow-up, 107 patients (30.1%) developed recurrence. The patterns of recurrence included local recurrence only in 20 patients (18.7%), distant metastasis only in 59 (55.1%), and both local recurrence and distant metastasis in 28 (26.2%). Thirteen of the 107 patients (12.1%) with recurrence developed malignant pleural effusion. The percentage of malignant pleural effusion in the PL2 group was significantly higher than that in the PL1 group (P = .006). Patients with PL2 had significantly worse overall survival(P + .046) and lower probability of freedom from recurrence(P = .028) in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: PL2 was a significant prognostic factor for recurrence and worse overall survival in node-negative NSCLC with VPI.

84865124318	Endoscopic tumor length is an independent prognostic factor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Purpose. To investigate the impact of endoscopic esophageal tumor length on survival for patients with resected esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic characteristics of 244 ESCC patients who underwent curative resection as the primary treatment at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between January 2000 and November 2010. The endoscopic tumor length was defined as a uniform measurement before completion of the esophagectomy. The impact of endoscopic tumor length on a patient's overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed. A Cox regression model was used to identify prognostic factors. Results. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 81.2, 48.2, and 39.6%, respectively, with a median survival time of 18.0 months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS rates were 66.2, 34.7, and 32.4%, respectively, with a median DFS of 15.0 months. Endoscopic tumor length correlated with pathologic tumor length [Pearson correction (r) = 0.621; P<0.001] Regression trees analyses suggested an optimum cutoff point of >4 cm to identify patients with decreased long-term survival. In multivariate survival analysis, endoscopic tumor length (more or less than 4 cm) remained an independent prognostic factor for both OS (P = 0.006) and DFS (P = 0.002). Conclusions. Endoscopic tumor length could have a significant impact on both the OS and DFS of patients with resected ESCC and may provide additional prognostic value to the current tumor, node, and metastasis staging system before patients receive any cancer-specific treatment. © 2012 Society of Surgical Oncology.

84865729111	Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 is a potential oncoprotein that upregulates G1 cyclins/cyclin-dependent kinases and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling cascade	Increasing evidence suggests that PRMT5, a protein arginine methyltransferase, is involved in tumorigenesis. However, no systematic research has demonstrated the cell-transforming activity of PRMT5. We investigated the involvement of PRMT5 in tumor formation. First, we showed that PRMT5 was associated with many human cancers, through statistical analysis of microarray data in the NCBI GEO database. Overexpression of ectopic PRMT5 per se or its specific shRNA enhanced or reduced cell growth under conditions of normal or low concentrations of serum, low cell density, and poor cell attachment. A stable clone that expressed exogenous PRMT5 formed tumors in nude mice, which demonstrated that PRMT5 is a potential oncoprotein. PRMT5 accelerated cell cycle progression through G1 phase and modulated regulators of G1; for example, it upregulated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4, CDK6, and cyclins D1, D2 and E1, and inactivated retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Moreover, PRMT5 activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and suppressed c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun signaling cascades. However, only inhibition of PI3K activity, and not overexpression of JNK, blocked PRMT5-induced cell proliferation. Further analysis of PRMT5 expression in 64 samples of human lung cancer tissues by microarray and western blot analysis revealed a tight association of PRMT5 with lung cancer. Knockdown of PRMT5 retarded cell growth of lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, we have characterized the cell-transforming activity of PRMT5 and delineated its underlying mechanisms for the first time. © 2012 Japanese Cancer Association.

0036804601	Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the trachea and bronchus - A clinicopathologic study with DNA flow cytometric analysis and oncogene expression	Objective: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the tracheobronchial tree is quite uncommon. The clinicopathologic analysis and the therapeutic outcomes of tracheobronchial ACC have been reported earlier. However, their biological behavior should differ from other tracheal neoplasms. Thus, DNA flow cytometric analysis and biomarkers of p53, HER-2/neu and COX-2 for tracheobronchial ACC were investigated in order to evaluate their clinicopathological significance. Methods: Between 1985 and 1999, nine patients with tracheobronchial ACC were included for the study. All the patients had pathologically confirmed ACC. Five were male and four were female. Eight patients underwent surgical resections. Seven paraffin embedded tumors from six patients were available for DNA flow cytomeric analysis and immunohistochemical staining of p53, HER-2/neu and COX-2. Results: Histologically, nine pathologic specimens from eight surgical patients (including one patient received operation twice) showed one grade I, five grade II and three grade III. The mitotic activity, lymphatic invasion and vascular invasion were more frequent in advanced grading tumor. The higher grade tumors seemed to be associated with a higher synthetic phase fraction (SPF). Immunohistochemically, except for one grade II tumor showing positive expression of HER-2/neu, all the seven tumorous samples revealed negative expressions of p53, COX-2 and HER-2/neu. The patient with positive HER-2/neu tumor had distant metastases 4 years after surgery. Conclusions: Complete surgical resection may provide best survival for tracheobronchial ACC. The DNA ploidy and SPF may correlate with tumor grading or metastasis. The overexpressions of HER-2/neu, p53 and COX-2 may impact the prognosis in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer, but did not express difference in our patients. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

0037348463	Cyclooxygenase-2 in human non-small cell lung cancer	Aim: Recent studies report that the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is increased, especially in adenocarcinoma. Platelet activating factor (PAF), n-sodium butyrate (n-BT), and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) are important mediators of the inflammatory process. Method: Expression of COX-2 in 67 stage 1 NSCLC paraffin-embedded tumor samples was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Four NSCL cell lines were incubated and stimulated by PAF, n-BT and PMA for 48 h. Expression of COX-2 was determined by IHC, immunoblotting, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Result: IHC showed increasing immunoreactivity in 35 of 67 (52%) in stage 1 NSCLC, 31 of 53 (59%) in adenocarcinoma and 13 of 15 (87%) in bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma, but only 2 of 12 (17%) in epidermoid carcinoma. The COX-2 expression in NSCLC cells was 75% (3/4) and the COX-1 expression in NSCLC cells was 100% (4/4). After stimulation with PMA, n-BT, PAF and n-BT + PAF, the COX-2 expression in NSCLC cells was significantly increased in all cell lines. Conclusions: The expression of COX-2 in NSCLC cells is high and was up-regulated by PMA, n-BT and PAF. We consider that COX-2 inhibitors will play an important role in the therapy of NSCLC. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

0037643640	Sclerosing hemangioma of the lung: An analysis of 44 cases	Background. Sclerosing hemangioma is a rare benign lung tumor. Preoperative diagnosis of this tumor is difficult, and sometimes even intraoperative frozen sections cannot differentiate it from malignant tumors. Herein, we present our experiences in investigating its characteristics. Methods. The medical records and pathological examinations of patients diagnosed with sclerosing hemangioma from 1982 to 2001 at the Division of Thoracic Surgery in Taipei-VGH were retrospectively reviewed. Results. The incidence of sclerosing hemangioma in benign lung tumors resected during that period was 32.8%. There were 44 patients (7 male and 37 female) aged from 16 to 72 years, with a peak at fifth decade, and 72.7% of them were asymptomatic. Accurate preoperative diagnosis by chest CT could be achieved in only 20% (4/20) of patients, and malignancy could not be ruled out in 40% (8/20) of tumors. Histologically, this tumor exhibits four major patterns: solid, sclerotic, papillary and hemorrhagic. Five patients in this series had predominantly one pattern. At least two patterns existed in the remaining 39 patients, including eight patients who had tumors with all four patterns. There was no operative mortality or tumor recurrence despite that different operative methods were undertaken. Conclusions. Although rare, sclerosing hemangioma still accounts for the second common benign lung tumor in the current series. Chest CT and bronchoscopic examinations could not make accurate diagnosis preoperatively, and thoracotomy is usually indicated for definite diagnosis and treatment. Limited resection is warranted in view of uncommon tumor recurrence. In addition, multiple nodular lesions could not exclude the possibility of sclerosing hemangioma.

0038649785	Usefulness of low-dose spiral CT of the chest in regular follow-up of postoperative non-small cell lung cancer patients: Preliminary report	Objectives: There is no consensus for the best postoperative follow-up in patients after complete resection of non-small cell lung cancer. Low-dose computed tomography of chest proves valuable in screening primary lung cancer and may be a useful tool in postoperative surveillance. Methods: In part 1, 30 patients who underwent surgical resection of non-small cell lung cancer and were at the first (n = 14), second (n = 9), or fifth (n = 7) annual postoperative surveillance were selected chronologically and subjected to chest radiography, low-dose computed tomography, and standard-dose computed tomography to verify the diagnostic accuracy of low-dose computed tomography. In part 2, 43 patients were prospectively enrolled and followed up regularly after complete resection of non-small cell lung cancer. The follow-up protocol included physical examination, sputum cytology, serum carcinoembryonic antigen, chest radiography, and low-dose computed tomography every 3 months in the first 2 years postoperatively until tumor recurrence. Results: In part 1, tumor recurrence was detected by standard-dose computed tomography in 7 cases. Low-dose computed tomography and chest radiography missed 1 and 5 of 7 cases, respectively. In part 2, tumor recurrence was found in 14 cases with 19 metastatic sites. Thirteen of the 14 (92.9%) cases were detected by scheduled visiting and 11 (78.6%) detected by low-dose computed tomography including the 7 without symptoms. Of the 19 recurrent sites found in 14 patients, 11 ones (57.9%) were detected by low-dose computed tomography. Conclusions: Low-dose computed tomography may be of considerable value in early detection of tumor recurrence in postoperative non-small cell lung cancer patients. Further large prospective studies are needed to verify this issue.

84866950478	Stromal invasion and micropapillary pattern in 212 consecutive surgically resected stage I lung adenocarcinomas: Histopathological categories for prognosis prediction	Background and Aim: It is of importance to search for prognostic indicators supplementing the tumour-node-metastasis stage for surgically resected early-stage lung adenocarcinomas. The roles of stromal invasion and micropapillary pattern in categorising histopathology and predicting the prognosis of stage I lung adenocarcinomas are explored. Methods: We retrospectively examined 212 consecutive surgically resected stage I lung adenocarcinomas to propose a new histopathology-based categorical classification. Category A tumours have pure lepidic growth pattern without stromal invasion (ie, adenocarcinoma in situ). Stromal invasion in the form of central fibrotic focus is absent in category B tumours and present in category C tumours. Category B is subclassi fied into B1, which has areas of lepidic growth, and B2, which does not. Category C is subclassified into C1, which has invasive tumour cells in the periphery of central fibrotic focus, and C2, which has invasive tumour cells in the centre of central fibrotic focus. Based on the absence or presence of micropapillary pattern, the C2 tumours are further subclassified into C2a and C2b, respectively. Results: The 5-year recurrence-free probabilities for categories B1 (17 cases), B2 (10 cases), C1 (nine cases), C2a (114 cases) and C2b (62 cases) are 100%, 78.8%, 100%, 67.5% and 53.1%, respectively (p<0.001). Conclusions: Based on stromal invasion and micropapillary pattern, the histopathological categorical classification proposed here provides a concise and precise scheme for outcome prediction in early-stage lung adenocarcinomas.

84868517795	MiRNA-146a expression positively regulates tumor necrosis factor-α-induced interleukin-8 production in mesenchymal stem cells and differentiated lung epithelial-like cells	Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) can be differentiated into lung epithelial-like cells (MSC-EC) in vitro. The response of BM-MSC and MSC-EC to stimuli may vary because of their character and differentiation. We aimed to investigate the factors that may influence in vitro differentiation of BM-MSC to MSC-EC. We determined the response of BM-MSC, MSC-EC, bronchial epithelial cells, and alveolar epithelial cells to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α stimulation. We also investigated the changes in micro(mi)RNA-146a, miRNA-155, and TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) expression after stimulation. Our results demonstrate that the addition of transforming growth factor-β

84874781977	Protein Phosphorylation Profiling Using an In Situ Proximity Ligation Assay: Phosphorylation of AURKA-Elicited EGFR-Thr654 and EGFR-Ser1046 in Lung Cancer Cells	The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is up-regulated in lung cancer, involves the activation of mitogenic signals and triggers multiple signaling cascades. To dissect these EGFR cascades, we used 14 different phospho-EGFR antibodies to quantify protein phosphorylation using an in situ proximity ligation assay (in situ PLA). Phosphorylation at EGFR-Thr654 and -Ser1046 was EGF-dependent in the wild-type (WT) receptor but EGF-independent in a cell line carrying the EGFR-L858R mutation. Using a ProtoAarray™ containing ~5000 recombinant proteins on the protein chip, we found that AURKA interacted with the EGFR-L861Q mutant. Moreover, overexpression of EGFR could form a complex with AURKA, and the inhibitors of AURKA and EGFR decreased EGFR-Thr654 and -Ser1046 phosphorylation. Immunohistochemical staining of stage I lung adenocarcinoma tissues demonstrated a positive correlation between AURKA expression and phosphorylation of EGFR at Thr654 and Ser1046 in EGFR-mutant specimens, but not in EGFR-WT specimens. The interplay between EGFR and AURKA provides an explanation for the difference in EGF dependency between EGFR-WT and EGFR-mutant cells and may provide a new therapeutic strategy for lung cancer patients carrying EGFR mutations. © 2013 Chen et al.

84875253573	Prognostic factors in resected pathological N1-stage II nonsmall cell lung cancer	Stage II nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been redefined in the seventh edition of tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classification for lung cancer. Stages IIa and IIb both contain node-negative (N0) and node-positive (N1) subgroups. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic factors for overall survival in patients with resected N1-stage II NSCLC. Between January 1992 and December 2010, we retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathological characteristics of 163 N1-stage II (T1a-T2bN1M0) NSCLC in patients undergoing curative resection as primary treatment. Median follow-up time was 37.2 months. The 1-, 3- and 5-yr overall survival rates were 85.3%, 62.1% and 43.5%, respectively. Tumour involvement of the hilar/interlobar nodal zone and poorly differentiated histological grade were significant predictors for worse overall survival using multivariate analysis (p=0.001 and p=0.015, respectively). There were trends toward worse overall survival in older patients and those with larger tumour size (p=0.063 and p=0.075, respectively). In resected N1-stage II NSCLC, hilar/interlobar nodal involvement and poorly differentiated histological grade were significant predictors of worse overall survival. The differences in survival between these subgroups of patients may lead to the use of different adjuvant therapies or postsurgical follow-up strategies.

84880573908	Effects of physical activity on the quality of life in Taiwanese lung cancer patients receiving active treatment or off treatment	BACKGROUND:: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world. Physical activity can enhance the quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients. However, the best timing according to cancer therapy to implement physical activities for lung cancer patients is not yet clear. OBJECTIVE:: The purpose of our study was to examine the relationship between physical activity and QOL in different cancer-treatment periods among lung cancer patients. METHODS:: This study used a cross-sectional design. Instruments included the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Cancer and the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. RESULTS:: In total, 185 patients participated in this study, and results showed that only 25% of participants achieved recommended physical-activity guidelines. Of all patients, 50.3% engaged in light physical activity, such as walking. During active-treatment periods, lung cancer patients who engaged in light or moderate activity had significantly higher scores for the overall QOL than did those who were completely sedentary. However, during off-treatment periods, there were no significant differences in the overall QOL with different activity levels. CONCLUSIONS:: The QOL may be improved by engaging in light or moderate physical activity during active-treatment periods among lung cancer patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:: It is important for healthcare providers to consider promoting physical activity based on different cancer treatments to improve the QOL of Taiwanese lung cancer patients.

84882797977	Comparison of survival among neoadjuvant chemoradiation responders, non-responders and patients receiving primary resection for locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma: Does neoadjuvant chemoradiation benefit all?	OBJECTIVESWhile neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery has been shown to improve the survival of patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer, it is not known whether neoadjuvant chemoradiation has a beneficial or harmful effect on the non-responders. We aimed to compare the outcomes among neoadjuvant chemoradiation responders, non-responders and patients receiving primary oesophagectomies for resectable locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.METHODSEighty-four non-T1-2N0 oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients were included. Thirty-eight patients received primary resection and 46 patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation. The overall survival of chemoradiation responders (<50% residual tumour), non-responders (>50% residual tumour and those who shifted to definitive chemoradiation instead of surgery due to tumour progression) and patients receiving primary resection were compared. Clinical parameters were also compared between responders and non-responders.RESULTSThere was no overall difference in survival between neoadjuvant chemoradiation and primary resection groups (2-year overall survival rates: 45.6 vs 54.3%, P = 0.442). In patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery, pathological responders had significantly higher 2-year overall survival rates than non-responders (64.5 vs 38.9%, P = 0.043). While the pathological responders had the highest survival rate, clinicopathological non-responders (pathological non-responders and patients with tumour progression during the neoadjuvant chemoradiation period) demonstrated significantly worse outcomes than those receiving primary resection (32.0 vs 54.3%, P = 0.036). However, none of the clinical parameters, including blood profiles, images and baseline tumour characteristics, predicted the response to chemoradiation before treatment.CONCLUSIONSNeoadjuvant chemoradiation non-responders demonstrated no benefit and an even worse outcome compared with those receiving primary resection for locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, no significant clinical parameters could be implemented in the clinics to predict the response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation before treatment. © The Author 2013.

84883235601	The prognostic value of the number of negative lymph nodes in esophageal cancer patients after transthoracic resection	Background: Although the number of positive lymph nodes (LN), the total number of resected LN, and the proportion of positive LN have been reported to be associated with survival in patients with esophageal cancer, little is known about the prognostic impact of the number of negative LN. Methods: A retrospective review of 754 patients receiving transthoracic esophagectomy for cancer between January 1995 and September 2011 was performed. The prognostic impact of the number of negative LN was analyzed. Log rank testing was used to compare survival curves, and Cox regression analysis was performed to identify significant prognostic factors. Results: A total of 707 patients were included. The mean follow-up time was 28.4 ± 30.9 months. The 5-year overall survival for the entire cohort was 30.1%. Patients with a high number of negative LN (≥19) had better overall survival than patients with a low number of negative LN (5-year survival rate 33.4% versus 26.4%, p = 0.005). Stratified analysis showed that the impact of the number of negative LN was significant in patients with T3/4 (p = 0.027) and node-positive (p = 0.002) esophageal cancers but not in patients with less advanced tumors. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the number of negative LN (in addition to age, sex, T stage, N stage, tumor length, and surgical approach) was an independent prognostic factor. Conclusions: A higher number of negative LN is associated with better overall survival of esophageal cancer patients after resection. The correlation of a high number of negative LN (≥19) with survival was more prominent in patients with advanced (T3/4 stage, node-positive) tumors. © 2013 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

84883788499	High expression of CHRNA1 is associated with reduced survival in early stage lung adenocarcinoma after complete resection	Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer deaths around the world, and a high recurrence rate after complete resection is an important issue reducing the cure rate and survival of patients with early stage NSCLC. Several pathologic biomarkers are associated with recurrence in early stage lung cancer after complete resection. Methods: We evaluated the expression and prognostic value of the α1 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA1) as well as other pathologic features of tumor tissues resected from patients with stage I adenocarcinoma of the lung. Results: A high ratio (173/185) of CHRNA1 expression (93.5 %) was found in stage I lung adenocarcinoma. In the multivariate survival analysis, tumor necrosis, angiolymphatic invasion, perineural invasion, and CHRNA1 expression were independent poor prognostic factors for both recurrence-free and overall survival (OS). Patients expressing CHRNA1 had worse median recurrence-free survival (60.6 vs. 77.9 months, P = 0.03) and OS (65.1 vs. 77.9 months, P = 0.04) compared with CHRNA1-negative patients. Conclusions: CHRNA1 expression could be directly tested from the tumor after complete resection. In early stage NSCLC, it could be a useful prognostic factor for recurrence and survival. © 2013 Society of Surgical Oncology.

0141520331	The role of mediastinoscopy in the evaluation of thoracic disease and lung cancer	Background. Mediastinoscopy is a widely used technique in the diagnosis of mediastinal disease and the staging of bronchogenic carcinoma. Its efficacy in the preoperative staging of lung cancer is well-established, with a procedural sensitivity of greater than 90% and specificity of 100%. Mediastinoscopy can also establish the diagnosis in greater than 90% of mediastinal disease. We conducted a retrospective study of mediastinoscopy performed at our institution between 1998 and 2001 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mediastinoscopy. Methods. We collected 100 consecutive mediastinoscopies performed in Thoracic Division of Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 1998 and 2001. The indications for mediastinoscopy included mediastinal mass or lymphadenopathy and the staging of lung cancer. Some patients had the undetermined lung mass with enlarged mediastinal lymph node. Results. There were 69 men and 31 women aged from 13 to 87 (mean 60.9). Sixty-seven patients had mediastinoscopy for the staging of lung cancer, 29 patients for diagnosis of mediastinal mass or lymphadenopathy, and 4 patients for undetermined lung mass with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Among the patients with mediastinal disease, sarcoidosis was diagnosed in 13 patients, and lymphoma in 5 patients. N2 or N3 nodal metastasis was revealed in 38 of 67 patients who had lung cancer. Fifteen patients with negative mediastinoscopy proceeded to thoracotomy for tumor resection. Seventeen patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by resection. There were three complications, all due to bleeding, and no mortality. Conclusions. Mediastinoscopy is a safe and effective procedure for the diagnosis of mediastinal disease and the staging of lung cancer. In cases of lung cancer, mediastinoscopy can provide more accurate evaluation of mediastinal lymph node metastasis than conventional diagnostic tools like computed scan or magnetic resonance image with low morbidity and mortality.

0042331532	Clinicopathologic significance of cyclooxygenase-2 overexpression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Background. Esophageal cancer is one of the most aggressive malignancies in the world, and whether multiple therapeutic modalities could improve long-term survival remains controversial. Recent studies have shown an increase of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in various malignancies, but its clinicopathologic role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unclear. Methods. From 1993 to 1997, tissue samples from 96 patients with ESCC who underwent esophagectomy at our institution were collected for analysis. Cyclooxygenase-2 expression was examined by immunohistochemical staining, and further confirmed by Western blot analysis on six frozen tissues. Clinicopathologic data were analyzed to verify the significance. Results. Cyclooxygenase-2 immunoreactivity was detected in 59 of 96 ESCC specimens (61%), and COX-2 overexpression (COX-2 high) was observed in 49% (47 of 96) of ESCCs. Statistical differences between COX-2 high and COX-2 low were found with respect to the status of distant metastasis (M factor) (p = 0.035) and tumor stage (p = 0.04). The survival was not significantly different between patients with and without COX-2 overexpression (p = 0.43). Using the Cox regression analysis, only the N factor (p = 0.0034) and M factor (p = 0.0325) were independent prognostic factors. Conclusions. Our results showed that in patients with ESCC, COX-2 overexpression was significantly correlated with fewer metastases and less advanced stage, but had no impact on survival. The status of local or distant lymph node metastasis was the most important prognostic factor.

0142059563	Surgical results of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus in young patients	Background. Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (ESCC) is one of the ten most common cancers in Taiwan. Surgical resection is the mainstay of the treatment. Young patients with ESCC are reported to have poor surgical outcome. This retrospective and comparative study is to evaluate the clinicopathologic difference and survival between young and elderly patients. Methods. From January 1985 to December 2000, totally 797 patients with esophageal cancer received esophagectomy with reconstruction at our institution. Among them, 12 patients who received neoadjuvant concurrent chemo-radiotherapy followed by esophagectomy were excluded from this study. The other 785 patients were divided into two groups. Group I included 67 patients aged 50 or younger (8.5%) and group II included 718 patients aged over 50 years (91.5%). The clinical data were collected by chart review and follow-up data were collected through outpatient department record or telephone contact. These two groups were analyzed and compared regarding sex ratio, exposure to tobacco or alcohol, surgical mortality rate and 5-year survival rate. Results. There was no difference in gender distribution between young and old patients groups. More patients in the young patients group had the habits of alcohol and tobacco consumption than in the elder patients group. The surgical (30-day) mortality was 2.98% in the young patient group, and 5.43% in the elder group. The 5-year survival rate was better in young patients group than in elder patients group but there was no statistical significance. Survival in young patients group was significantly related to TNM staging system. Conclusions. More young patients with ESCC had the habit of smoking and drinking. There was no statistical difference between the groups in clinical variables, surgical mortality and survival. The survival rate was significantly related to the TNM tumor stage.

0345687879	Long-term results of pathological stage I non-small cell lung cancer: Validation of using the number of totally removed lymph nodes as a staging control	Objective: The number of totally removed lymph nodes during thoracotomy was used alternatively to represent the quality of lymphadenectomy in patients with pathologic stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We combined this new parameter with other well-established prognostic factors and performed multivariate survival analyses to validate its usage as a stage control. Methods: Three hundred and twenty-one patients who underwent complete surgical resection for stage I NSCLC were reviewed retrospectively. Aside from the number of lymph nodes removed during thoracotomy, other well-known clinical and histopathological factors were also included as possible prognostic factors for analysis. Two survival analyses, overall death and cancer-related death as study end-point, were performed, using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis. Stepwise method of variable selection was employed to choose the 'best' Cox proportional hazard model in each survival analysis. Results: The overall 5- and 10-year survival rates were 48 and 35%, and the cancer-related 5- and 10-year survival rate was 63.3 and 58.3%, respectively. The number of totally removed lymph nodes during thoracotomy, tumor size and smoking history in multivariable analysis significantly affected both overall and cancer-related survival rates. Cell type of adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma was associated with a worse cancer-related survival compared with other histological types. Conclusions: The quality of lymphadenectomy, represented quantitatively by the number of totally removed lymph nodes during thoracotomy, may impact on a more accurate tumor stage, and will affect the survival rate for patients with stage I NSCLC as well as other well known clinical and histopathological factors. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

84888138347	Prognostic value of the new international association for the study of lung cancer/American thoracic society/European respiratory society lung adenocarcinoma classification on death and recurrence in completely resected stage i lung adenocarcinoma	OBJECTIVE:: This study investigated the prognostic value of the new International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society (IASLC/ATS/ERS) lung adenocarcinoma classification in resected stage I lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS:: Histological classification of 283 patients undergoing surgical resection for stage I lung adenocarcinoma was determined according to the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification after comprehensive histological subtyping with recording of the percentage of each histological component (lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary, and solid) in 5% increments. Their impact on overall survival, recurrence, and postrecurrence survival was investigated. RESULTS:: The 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free rates were 81.6% and 76.9%, respectively. During follow-up, 57 (20.1%) patients developed recurrence. The 2-year postrecurrence survival rate was 72.3%. The solid predominant group is associated with significant more male sex, higher smoking exposure, larger tumor size, and more poorly differentiated histological grade. Lepidic predominant group had significantly better overall survival (P = 0.002). Micropapillary and solid predominant groups had significantly lower probability of freedom from recurrence (P = 0.004). Older age (P = 0.039), visceral pleural invasion to the surface (PL2) (P = 0.009), and high grade (micropapillary/solid predominant) of the new classification (P = 0.028) were predictors of recurrence in multivariate analysis. The solid predominant group tends to have significantly worse postrecurrence survival (P = 0.074). CONCLUSIONS:: The new adenocarcinoma classification has significant impact on death and recurrence in stage I lung adenocarcinoma. Patients with PL2 and micropapillary/solid predominant pattern have significant higher risk for recurrence. This information is important for patient stratification for aggressive adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. © 2013 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

84888289435	Surgical outcomes in lung cancer presenting as ground-glass opacities of 3cm or less: A review of 5 years' experience	Background: High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has become increasingly popular recently and more pulmonary ground-glass opacities (GGOs) are being identified. However, the treatment for these GGOs remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review the clinical and pathological characteristics and to demonstrate the longterm surgical outcomes in patients undergoing resection for GGOs in our institute. Methods: From January 2004 to December 2008, we enrolled 50 patients undergoing resection for solitary pulmonary GGOs of 3cm or less at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Patients with a past history of lung cancer, or multiple GGOs at presentation, or GGOs accompanied by a solid component of more than 50 percent were excluded. The patients were retrospectively reviewed and the rate and circumstances of survival were analyzed. Results: Of the 50 patients, 43 (86%) patients underwent surgery immediately after the GGO lesions were detected by the initial HRCT. Forty-six (92.0%) patients were diagnosed with lung cancer. Of this group, there were 8 (17.4%) adenocarcinomas with lepidic predominant pattern, 13 (28.3%) adenocarcinomas with acinar predominant pattern, and 24 (52.2%) adenocarcinomas with papillary predominant pattern. There was one adenocarcinoma that was mixed with small cell carcinoma. There was no surgical mortality overall, and the 5-year overall and disease-specific survival rates were 97.5% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: The percentage of malignancy is high in pulmonary GGOs. Surgery results in an excellent prognosis in these patients. © 2013.

84889259198	Surgical results of synchronous multiple primary lung cancers: Similar to the stage-matched solitary primary lung cancers?	Background Treatment for synchronous multiple primary lung cancers (SMPLC) remains controversial. Some surgeons treat SMPLC like advanced lung cancer, whereas other surgeons treat SMPLC as separate primary lung cancers. In this study, survival of SMPLC patients and matched-stage solitary primary lung cancer (SPLC) patients after surgical treatment were compared. Methods Prospective medical records between 2001 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Results A total of 1,995 patients underwent pulmonary resection for lung cancer in a tertiary referral center. Only 97 patients met the modified criteria of Martini and Melamed for SMPLC. The median follow-up time was 38.3 months. The 3-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 83.1% and 69.6%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, males, smokers, and tumor size greater than 3 cm demonstrated significantly worse survival. After multivariate analysis, only tumor size (p = 0.018; hazard ratio 3.199) was identified as an independent predictor of survival. In addition, there was no significant difference in overall survival between the matched-stage SMPLC and SPLC without mediastinal lymph node involvement. Subgroup analysis in the multiple synchronous adenocarcinoma (n = 78) group demonstrated no significant difference between similar and different comprehensive histologic subtyping with respect to overall survival (61.3% versus 68.8%, p = 0.474). Conclusions The surgical results for SMPLC were compatible and acceptable with those for SPLC even with similar histologic subtyping, instead of T4 or M1 stages in the current TNM classification system. Preoperatively, tumor size was the only independent prognostic factor for SMPLC with surgical intervention. © 2013 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

84893165961	Open versus thoracoscopic esophagectomy in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Background: The impact of minimally invasive esophagectomy on patient prognosis, particularly disease-free survival (DFS), has not been well addressed. We compared the clinical outcomes of open and thoracoscopic esophagectomy in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: Sixty-three and 66 patients, nonrandomized, underwent open and thoracoscopic esophagectomies for ESCC between 2008 and 2011 were included. The clinicopathological data were reviewed retrospectively. Perioperative outcome, overall survival (OS), DFS, and the recurrence sites after open and thoracoscopic esophagectomy were compared. Results: The open and thoracoscopic groups were comparable with regard to the total number of harvested lymph nodes and the percentage patients undergoing R0 resection. Fewer patients in the thoracoscopic group had pneumonia and wound complications. Intensive care unit (ICU) stay also was shorter in the thoracoscopic group. The recurrence pattern was similar in the two groups. In the open and thoracoscopic groups, the 3-year OS rates were 47.6 and 70.9 % (p = 0.031), respectively, and the 3-year DFS rates were 35 and 62.4 % (p = 0.007), respectively. However, the trends in better OS and DFS in the thoracoscopic group were not significant after stratification according to pathologic stage. Conclusions: The perioperative benefit of thoracoscopic esophagectomy included fewer postoperative complications and shorter ICU stays. Mid-term OS and DFS associated with thoracoscopic techniques are at least equivalent to those associated with open procedures. © 2013 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.

84899956571	Survival benefits of postoperative chemoradiation for lymph node-positive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Background Little is known about the efficacy of chemoradiation therapy after surgery for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. This retrospective study aimed to determine whether postoperative chemoradiation improves survival compared with surgery alone. Methods Of 290 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 104 received postoperative chemoradiation therapy (CRT group) and 186 underwent surgery alone (S group). Propensity score matching analysis was used to identify 56 well-balanced pairs of patients to compare outcomes. Results For N0 patients, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were similar in both groups. For N+ patients, the median OS (31.0 versus 16.0 months) and the 3-year OS rate (45.8% versus 14.1%) were significantly higher in the CRT group than in the S group (p < 0.001). Similarly, the median DFS (16.0 versus 9.0 months) and the 3-year DFS rate (24.1% versus 11.5%) were significantly higher in the CRT group than in the S group (p = 0.002). In propensity-matched patients, a survival benefit was observed for N+ patients receiving postoperative chemoradiation (CRT versus S group: median OS 29.0 versus 16.0 months, 3-year OS rate 48.6% versus 16.8%; p = 0.003). Disease-free survival (median DFS 11.0 versus 8.0 months, 3-year DFS rate 21.3% versus 12.5%) tended to be better in the CRT group than in the S group (p = 0.057). Conclusions Postoperative chemoradiation therapy provided a survival benefit for patients with lymph node-positive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. © 2014 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

84899977616	Loss of CRNN expression is associated with advanced tumor stage and poor survival in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Objective: CRNN gene expression is downregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), although its clinical implications in esophageal cancer remain unclear. Methods: We performed integrated microarray analysis and identified the CRNN gene as 1 of the major downregulated genes in ESCC. CRNN downregulation was validated at the nucleic acid level in 16 ESCC cases using complementary DNA microarray and at the protein level by immunohistochemical stains in an additional 220 ESCC cases. The clinicopathologic relevance and prognostic significance of CRNN expression in ESCC were explored. Results: Downregulated CRNN expression was noted at the messenger RNA and protein levels. Immunohistochemical staining revealed negative and positive CRNN expression in 171 (77.7%) and 49 (22.3%) patients with ESCC, respectively. Patients with negative CRNN protein expression had an advanced tumor invasion depth (P =.002), advanced nodal involvement (P =.014), and longer tumor length (P =.037). Patients with negative CRNN expression (median survival, 14.0 months; 5-year survival rate, 20.5%) had poorer overall survival than those with positive expression (30.0 months and 40.3%, respectively; P =.006). On multivariate analysis, negative CRNN expression, nodal involvement, and distant metastasis remained significant prognostic factors for poor overall survival (negative vs positive CRNN, hazard ratio, 1.464; P =.047). Conclusions: Our analysis has highlighted the clinical implications of CRNN expression in ESCC. Loss of CRNN expression correlated with advanced tumor length, greater tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, and poor survival in patients with ESCC.

84905716243	TPX2 expression is associated with cell proliferation and patient outcome in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Background: The molecular and genetic changes underlying esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tumor formation and rapid progression are poorly understood. Using high-throughput data analysis, we examined molecular changes involved in ESCC pathogenesis and investigated their clinical relevance. Methods: Five independent microarray datasets were examined for differentially expressed genes and pathways. For validation, mRNA expression in tumor and matched normal tissues from 16 ESCC cases was examined by cDNA microarray, and protein expression in 97 ESCC specimens was investigated using immunohistochemical stains. The association between clinicopathological parameters and the expression of Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A) and TPX2 was analyzed. The impact of TPX2 expression was also assessed in ESCC cancer cells. Results: AURKA and TPX2, members of the "Role of Ran in mitotic spindle regulation" pathway, were selected for further investigation. Verification by cDNA microarray showed that both genes were overexpressed in tumor tissues, and immunohistochemical staining showed Aurora-A and TPX2 expression in 88.4 and 90.6 % of ESCC specimens, respectively. High TPX2 expression was a significant prognosticator for overall and disease-free survival in univariate analysis and remained an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (HR 1.802, p = 0.037). TPX2 knockdown clones showed inhibited cellular proliferation in growth curve studies and formed fewer colonies in the clonogenic assay. Conclusions: Using bioinformatics resources, which were validated by microarray analysis and immunohistochemistry stains, and manipulation of TPX2 expression in ESCC cell lines, we demonstrated that TPX2 expression is associated with cell proliferation and poor prognosis among patients with resected ESCC. © 2013 Springer.

84905836884	Predictive value of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification of lung adenocarcinoma in tumor recurrence and patient survival	Purpose: This study investigated the pattern of recurrence of lung adenocarcinoma and the predictive value of histologic classification in resected lung adenocarcinoma using the new International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC)/American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) classification system. Patients and Methods: Histologic classification of 573 patients undergoing resection for lung adenocarcinoma was determined according to the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification system, and the percentage of each histologic component (lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary, and solid) was recorded. The pattern of recurrence of those components and their predictive value were investigated. Results: The predominant histologic pattern was significantly associated with sex (P < .01), invasive tumor size (P < .01), T status (P < .01), N status (P < .01), TNM stage (P < .01), and visceral pleural invasion (P < .01). The percentage of recurrence was significantly higher in micropapillary- and solid-predominant adenocarcinomas (P < .01). Micropapillary- and solid-predominant adenocarcinomas had a significantly higher possibility of developing initial extrathoracic-only recurrence than other types (P < .01). The predominant pattern group (micropapillary or solid v lepidic, acinar, or papillary) was a significant prognostic factor in overall survival (OS; P < .01), probability of freedom from recurrence (P < .01), and disease-specific survival (P < .01) in multivariable analysis. For patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, solid-predominant adenocarcinoma was a significant predictor for poor OS (P = .04). Conclusion: In lung adenocarcinoma, the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification system has significant prognostic and predictive value regarding death and recurrence. Solid-predominant adenocarcinoma was also a significant predictor in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. Prognostic and predictive information is important for stratifying patients for aggressive adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

10044226229	Preoperative serum albumin level is a prognostic indicator for adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia	Among patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia, we noted that patients with higher preoperative serum albumin levels appeared to survive longer than patients with lower levels. Thus, we evaluated serum albumin as a prognostic factor for patient survival. From 1987 to 1997, 314 patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia underwent curative resection. Patient serum albumin levels were evaluated on the second day after admission, before any nutritional support. Patients were divided into two groups: those with normal serum albumin levels (>3.5 g/dl) and those with abnormal serum albumin levels. The perioperative mortality and morbidity were 5.7% (18 of 314) and 22.3% (70 of 314), respectively. The surgical resectability rate was significantly better among patients with normal serum albumin levels (P < 0.001). The 5-year overall survival rate of patients with normal serum albumin levels was also better than those with abnormally low serum albumin levels (38.4% versus 19.1%, P = 0.0003). In each cancer stage, the 5-year survival rate of patients with normal serum albumin levels was better than that among those with hypoalbuminemia. By multivariate analysis, serum albumin level and the pathologic T, N statuses were independent factors correlated with prognosis. Preoperative serum albumin level correlated highly with resectability and survival. Patients with abnormal serum albumin levels had worse survival than did those with normal serum albumin levels. We recommend that postoperative adjuvant therapy be given to all patients with hypoalbuminemia preoperatively. © 2004 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.
