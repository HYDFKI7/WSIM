23944485965	An efficient multi-source multicast routing protocol inmobile ad hoc networks	Mobile ad hoc networks are organized by a collection of wireless devices. Any pre-established wired or wireless infrastructure or centralized administration is unnecessary. Thus, ad hoc wireless networks are particularly useful in regions such as battle-fields or disaster areas. There are numerous applications, such as video conferencing, distance learning and video on-demand relay on multicast routing. Most existing multicast routing protocols in ad hoc networks consider only one source in a multicast group, resulting in large overhead when the system is extended to multi-source multicasting. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based multi-source multicast routing protocol to provide efficient multicasting in the multi-source multicast environment. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol generates low overhead without dropping the delivery ratio in the multi-source multicast environment. © 2005 IEEE.

27144459006	Flexible protein-ligand docking using particle swarm optimization	Many protein-ligand docking problems attempt to predict the bound conformations of two interacting molecules. Consequently, the docking problem requires a powerful search technique to explore the translations, orientations, and each torsion until an ideal site has been found. Therefore, protein-ligand docking can be formulated as a parameter optimization problem. However, highly flexible ligands have a lot of torsions. Therefore, the optimization problem of highly flexible docking would become more difficult due to the increment of parameter number and interactions among these parameters. We proposed a novel method SODOCK based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) for solving flexible protein-ligand docking problems. PSO has significant effect on the optimization of parameters with strong interactions. A commonly used efficient local search is incorporated into SODOCK to improve the efficiency and robustness of PSO. SODOCK is efficient for both types of ligands with small and large numbers of torsions. It is shown by computer simulation that SODOCK performs well in obtaining accurate conformations, compared with some of state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, it is also shown that SODOCK is superior to AutoDock using the same energy function in AutoDock 3.05 in terms of convergence speed, robustness, and docking energy, especially for highly flexible docking problems. © 2005 IEEE.

27844583346	A scalable and reliable multicast routing protocol for ad-hoc wireless networks	Multicasting is an essential service for ad-hoc wireless networks. In a multicasting environment with multiple senders, receivers or meeting members, traditional multicast routing protocols must pay great overhead for multiple multicast sessions. This work presents a scalable and reliable multicasting protocol for ad-hoc wireless networks. A virtual backbone is used as a shared structure for multiple sessions. A clustering scheme is used to reduce the routing path length. A novel scheme is developed to effectively multicast packets using forwarding gates. Furthermore, a lost packet recovery scheme is developed for reliable packet transmission. This scheme can be used to improve the reliability of traditional non-acknowledged multicasting approach. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed multicasting scheme and the results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms other schemes in terms of packet delivery ratio, packet delivery time, control overhead, multicast efficiency, and cost effect. Furthermore, our approach is stable for networks with high mobility and the lost packet recovery scheme is cost-effective. © Springer 2005.

32444440487	MeSwarm: Memetic particle swarm optimization	In this paper, a novel variant of particle swarm optimization (PSO), named memetic particle swarm optimization algorithm (MeSwarm), is proposed for tackling the overshooting problem in the motion behavior of PSO. The overshooting problem is a phenomenon in PSO due to the velocity update mechanism of PSO. While the overshooting problem occurs, particles may be led to wrong or opposite directions against the direction to the global optimum. As a result, MeSwarm integrates the standard PSO with the Solis and Wets local search strategy to avoid the overshooting problem and that is based on the recent probability of success to efficiently generate a new candidate solution around the current particle. Thus, six test functions and a real-world optimization problem, the flexible protein-ligand docking problem are used to validate the performance of MeSwarm. The experimental results indicate that MeSwarm outperforms the standard PSO and several evolutionary algorithms in terms of solution quality.

33646797406	An efficient anycasting scheme in ad-hoc wireless networks	When searching for resources on networks, the system often depends on the broadcast or multicast mechanism to acquire the information, which usually results in large overhead. It will be a serious problem in ad-hoc wireless networks, where the bandwidth is limited and each node moves arbitrarily and acts not only as a host but also as a router. This work proposes an efficient anycasting scheme in ad-hoc wireless networks. The scheme can be used to reduce the request messages, decrease the overhead of response received from duplicate packets, and balance the load of ad-hoc wireless networks. Furthermore, our scheme can support any K services and attain the backup or fault tolerance purpose. © 2004 IEEE.

33751311798	Knowledge acquisition and development of accurate rules for predicting protein stability changes	Knowing the mechanisms by which protein stability change is one of the most important and valuable tasks in molecular biology. The conventional methods of predicting protein stability changes mainly focus on improving prediction accuracy. However, it is desirable to extract domain knowledge from large databases that is beneficial to accurate prediction of the protein stability change. This paper presents an interpretable prediction tree method (named iPTREE) that produces explanatory rules to explore hidden knowledge accompanied with high prediction accuracy and consequently analyzes the factors influencing the protein stability changes. To evaluate iPTREE and the knowledge upon protein stability changes, a thermodynamic dataset consisting of 1615 mutants led by single point mutation from ProTherm is adopted. Being as a predictor for protein stability changes, the rule-based approach can achieve a prediction accuracy of 87%, which is better than other methods based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM). Besides, these methods lack the ability in biological knowledge discovery. The human-interpretable rules produced by iPTREE reveal that temperature is a factor of concern in predicting protein stability changes. For example, one of interpretable rules with high support is as follows: if the introduced residue type is Alanine and temperature is between 4 °C and 40 °C, then the stability change will be negative (destabilizing). The present study demonstrates that iPTREE can easily be used in the application of protein stability changes where one requires more understandable knowledge. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33845523359	A grid-based manycast scheme for large mobile ad hoc networks	Services providing between clients and servers is an important issue in mobile ad hoc networks. Since services become complex and various increasingly, current group communication mechanisms like multicast or anycast do not completely support some kind of services such as NTP (Network Time Protocol) or threshold cryptography, etc. Manycast is a novel group communication paradigm in which a client communicates simultaneously with a number k of m equivalent servers in a group and can support these kinds of services. In this paper, we present a grid-based manycast scheme that employs manycast level calculation algorithm to predict a manycast region and uses an efficient grid broadcast method to support manycast delivery for large ad hoc networks. Simulation results show that our scheme not only reduces significantly more manycast overhead and the average number of replied servers but also keeps high manycast successful rate. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

33750946389	Design and implementation of anycast protocols for mobile ad-hoc networks	In mobile ad-hoc networks, anycast techniques can be used to find the nearest service through the anycast address. Although some anycast schemes have been designed and developed for mobile ad-hoc networks, few of them have been practically implemented on real mobile ad-hoc networks, especially for IPv6 based mobile ad-hoc networks. This work designs and implements an anycast scheme which consists of two parts, an anycast address mapper and a clustering scheme. The anycast address mapper is used to resolve the anycast address. The clustering scheme is used to manage the overhead of the anycast requests. In order to make the clustering scheme be able to support IPv6, the message formats and schemes must be modified to support the features of the IPv6. Experiments are conducted and experimental results demonstrate that our anycast schemes can resolve the anycast address via the anycast address mapper and our schemes can effectively operate on IPv6 mobile ad-hoc networks.

33846630833	SODOCK: Swarm optimization for highly flexible protein-ligand docking	Protein-ligand docking can be formulated as a parameter optimization problem associated with an accurate scoring function, which aims to identify the translation, orientation, and conformation of a docked ligand with the lowest energy. The parameter optimization problem for highly flexible ligands with many rotatable bonds is more difficult than that for less flexible ligands using genetic algorithm (GA)-based approaches, due to the large numbers of parameters and high correlations among these parameters. This investigation presents a novel optimization algorithm SODOCK based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) for solving flexible protein-ligand docking problems. To improve efficiency and robustness of PSO, an efficient local search strategy is incorporated into SODOCK. The implementation of SODOCK adopts the environment and energy function of AutoDock 3.05. Computer simulation results reveal that SODOCK is superior to the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) of AutoDock, in terms of convergence performance, robustness, and obtained energy, especially for highly flexible ligands. The results also reveal that PSO is more suitable than the conventional GA in dealing with flexible docking problems with high correlations among parameters. This investigation also compared SODOCK with four state-of-the-art docking methods, namely GOLD 1.2, DOCK 4.0, FlexX 1.8, and LGA of AutoDock 3.05. SODOCK obtained the smallest RMSD in 19 of 37 cases. The average 2.29 Å of the 37 RMSD values of SODOCK was better than those of other docking programs, which were all above 3.0 Å. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33847202210	Interpretable prediction of protein stability changes upon mutation by using decision tree	For protein stability changes upon mutation, an accurate predictor with linguistic interpretability is beneficial to protein designs. Traditional analysis based on linear correlation between predicted and experimental data reveals their primitive relationships. Recently, some machine learning techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN)-based methods were applied to find an accurate predictor. However, the ANN-predictor without interpretability is insufficient in knowledge discovery. This paper proposes an interpretable predictor using a rule-based decision tree method (named iPTREE) for accurately predicting protein stability changes upon single point mutations. Besides being a sign predictor, iPTREE can be used both as a model for verifying attributes effect, and as a rules miner in the protein stability change study. iPTREE is depending on features including mutation type (deleted and introduced residues), the relative solvent accessibility value (RSA), the experimental conditions (pH and temperature) and the local spatial environment. To evaluate the performance of iPTREE, a thermodynamic dataset consisting of 1615 mutations generated from ProTherm is used. The computer simulation shows that iPTREE has an accurate prediction for the direction of stability changes as high as 87%, which is significantly better than the ANN-predictor for the same features. © 2005 IEEE.

34548425686	Accurate prediction of enzyme subfamily class using an adaptive fuzzy k-nearest neighbor method	Amphiphilic pseudo-amino acid composition (Am-Pse-AAC) with extra sequence-order information is a useful feature for representing enzymes. This study first utilizes the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) rule to analyze the distribution of enzymes in the Am-Pse-AAC feature space. This analysis indicates the distributions of multiple classes of enzymes are highly overlapped. To cope with the overlap problem, this study proposes an efficient non-parametric classifier for predicting enzyme subfamily class using an adaptive fuzzy r-nearest neighbor (AFK-NN) method, where k and a fuzzy strength parameter m are adaptively specified. The fuzzy membership values of a query sample Q are dynamically determined according to the position of Q and its weighted distances to the k nearest neighbors. Using the same enzymes of the oxidoreductases family for comparisons, the prediction accuracy of AFK-NN is 76.6%, which is better than those of Support Vector Machine (73.6%), the decision tree method C5.0 (75.4%) and the existing covariant-discriminate algorithm (70.6%) using a jackknife test. To evaluate the generalization ability of AFK-NN, the datasets for all six families of entirely sequenced enzymes are established from the newly updated SWISS-PROT and ENZYME database. The accuracy of AFK-NN on the new large-scale dataset of oxidoreductases family is 83.3%, and the mean accuracy of the six families is 92.1%. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

34548458988	ProLoc: Prediction of protein subnuclear localization using SVM with automatic selection from physicochemical composition features	Accurate prediction methods of protein subnuclear localizations rely on the cooperation between informative features and classifier design. Support vector machine (SVM) based learning methods are shown effective for predictions of protein subcellular and subnuclear localizations. This study proposes an evolutionary support vector machine (ESVM) based classifier with automatic selection from a large set of physicochemical composition (PCC) features to design an accurate system for predicting protein subnuclear localization, named ProLoc. ESVM using an inheritable genetic algorithm combined with SVM can automatically determine the best number m of PCC features and identify m out of 526 PCC features simultaneously. To evaluate ESVM, this study uses two datasets SNL6 and SNL9, which have 504 proteins localized in 6 subnuclear compartments and 370 proteins localized in 9 subnuclear compartments. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation, ProLoc utilizing the selected m = 33 and 28 PCC features has accuracies of 56.37% for SNL6 and 72.82% for SNL9, which are better than 51.4% for the SVM-based system using k-peptide composition features applied on SNL6, and 64.32% for an optimized evidence-theoretic k-nearest neighbor classifier utilizing pseudo amino acid composition applied on SNL9, respectively. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

38049066988	An efficient grid-based data gathering scheme in wireless sensor networks	Data gathering is an important operation in wireless sensor networks. Due to the limited battery power, sensor nodes consume significant energy and drain out of it quickly if each node transmits its sensed data directly to a distant base station, even though the delay time is minimized in a round of communication. Hence, there is a trade-off between minimizing both of the energy consumed by sensor nodes and the delay time, then the overall cost is defined as the energy x delay cost. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Grid-based Data Gathering (EGDG) scheme which adopts a hierarchical grid structure and constructs cycles by connecting heads in each order of the hierarchy. Data transmissions move toward a leader from two starter nodes simultaneously in each cycle. The objective of EGDG is to achieve a better result for the energy x delay cost comparing to other schemes, and also to accomplish significant coverage-preserving at the same time. Simulation results show that EGDG outperforms than LEACH and PEGASIS in terms of rounds, the energy x delay cost and coverage-preserving. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

40249110012	ProLoc-GO: Utilizing informative Gene Ontology terms for sequence-based prediction of protein subcellular localization	Background: Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, which describes the function of genes and gene products across species, has recently been used to predict protein subcellular and subnuclear localization. Existing GO-based prediction methods for protein subcellular localization use the known accession numbers of query proteins to obtain their annotated GO terms. An accurate prediction method for predicting subcellular localization of novel proteins without known accession numbers, using only the input sequence, is worth developing. Results: This study proposes an efficient sequence-based method (named ProLoc-GO) by mining informative GO terms for predicting protein subcellular localization. For each protein, BLAST is used to obtain a homology with a known accession number to the protein for retrieving the GO annotation. A large number n of all annotated GO terms that have ever appeared are then obtained from a large set of training proteins. A novel genetic algorithm based method (named GOmining) combined with a classifier of support vector machine (SVM) is proposed to simultaneously identify a small number m out of the n GO terms as input features to SVM, where m ≪n. The m informative GO terms contain the essential GO terms annotating subcellular compartments such as GO:0005634 (Nucleus), GO:0005737 (Cytoplasm) and GO:0005856 (Cytoskeleton). Two existing data sets SCL12 (human protein with 12 locations) and SCL16 (Eukaryotic proteins with 16 locations) with <25% sequence identity are used to evaluate ProLoc-GO which has been implemented by using a single SVM classifier with the m = 44 and m = 60 informative GO terms, respectively. ProLoc-GO using input sequences yields test accuracies of 88.1% and 83.3% for SCL12 and SCL16, respectively, which are significantly better than the SVM-based methods, which achieve < 35% test accuracies using amino acid composition (AAC) with acid pairs and AAC with dipedtide composition. For comparison, ProLoc-GO using known accession numbers of query proteins yields test accuracies of 90.6% and 85.7%, which is also better than Hum-PLoc (85.0%) and Euk-OET-PLoc (83.7%) using ensemble classifiers with hybridization of GO terms and amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition for SCL12 and SCL16, respectively. Conclusion: The growth of Gene Ontology in size and popularity has increased the effectiveness of GO-based features. GOmining can serve as a tool for selecting informative GO terms in solving sequence-based prediction problems. The prediction system using ProLoc-GO with input sequences of query proteins for protein subcellular localization has been implemented (see Availability). © 2008 Huang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

41149175446	A novel intelligent multiobjective simulated annealing algorithm for designing robust PID controllers	This paper proposes an intelligent multiobjective simulated annealing algorithm (IMOSA) and its application to an optimal proportional integral derivative (PID) controller design problem. A well-designed PID-type controller should satisfy the following objectives: 1) disturbance attenuation; 2) robust stability; and 3) accurate setpoint tracking. The optimal PID controller design problem is a large-scale multiobjective optimization problem characterized by the following: 1) nonlinear multimodal search space; 2) large-scale search space; 3) three tight constraints; 4) multiple objectives; and 5) expensive objective function evaluations. In contrast to existing multiobjective algorithms of simulated annealing, the high performance in IMOSA arises mainly from a novel multiobjective generation mechanism using a Pareto-based scoring function without using heuristics. The multiobjective generation mechanism operates on a high-score nondominated solution using a systematic reasoning method based on an orthogonal experimental design, which exploits its neighborhood to economically generate a set of well-distributed nondominated solutions by considering individual and overall objectives. IMOSA is evaluated by using a practical design example of a super-maneuverable fighter aircraft system. An efficient existing multiobjective algorithm, the improved strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm, is also applied to the same example for comparison. Simulation results demonstrate high performance of the IMOSA-based method in designing robust PID controllers. © 2008 IEEE.

43949102057	An artificial intelligence approach to course timetabling	Course Timetabling is a complex problem that cannot be dealt with by using only a few general principles. The various actors (the administrator, the chairman, the instructor and the student) have their own objectives, and these objectives usually conflict. The complexity of the relationships among time slots, classes, classrooms, and instructors makes it difficult to achieve a feasible solution. In this article, we propose an artificial intelligence approach that integrates expert systems and constraint programming to implement a course timetabling system. Expert systems are utilized to incorporate knowledge into the timetabling system and to provide a reasoning capability for knowledge deduction. Separating out the knowledge base, the facts, and the inference engine in expert systems provides greater flexibility in supporting changes. The constraint hierarchy and the constraint network are utilized to capture hard and soft constraints and to reason about constraints by using constraint satisfaction and relaxation techniques. In addition, object-oriented software engineering is applied to improve the development and maintenance of the course timetabling system. A course timetabling system in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at the National Changhua University of Education (NCUE) is used as an illustrative example of the proposed approach. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.

66149118895	Efficient data reporting for object tracking in wireless sensor networks with mobile sinks	Object tracking is an important application in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, most of researches focus on how to track mobile objects accurately and do not consider data reporting, especially when sinks move arbitrarily in the sensor field. In this paper, we propose an efficient data reporting method for object tracking in WSNs with mobile sinks. In our network environment, the sensor field is divided into several grids. Only some nodes are elected as active nodes for tracking the object and reporting data, the others are in sleep mode for saving energy. Moreover, a simple scheduling is given to balance the energy consumption of nodes. To guide the current position of the sink and reduce the update cost as the sink moves, we design an elegant weight function for active nodes. By the weight function, the tracking data can be forwarded to the mobile sink efficiently. In addition, we also propose a simple object tracking method in which an object can be detected by two or more active nodes with tracking flags. Simulation results show that our proposed method outperforms than TNT and SNEM in terms of the energy consumption and average hop counts. ©2008 IEICE.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a hierarchical grid structure to reduce the total energy consumption, and utilizes a tree architecture to decrease the transmission delay. Findings: In the results, the proposed method performs better, in terms of the number of rounds and the energy × delay cost, than other data gathering protocols with different network sizes and node densities. Moreover, the proposed method also provides good coverage preservation in different environments. Research limitations/implications: In this paper, sensor nodes are assumed to be uniformly distributed, homogenous, energy-constrained. Each sensor node also has ability to adjust its transmission power. For practice, the proposed method needs location information of sensor nodes and the radio interference between sensor nodes during data transmissions should be considered. Practical implications: The proposed method can significantly reduce the delay time and may be suitable for real-time data gathering applications. Originality/value: This paper combines hierarchical grid structure with tree architecture to minimize the energy × delay cost for data gathering application. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Such networks are usually applied to gather data from interested area or specific environment and deliver to remote users for analyzing or monitoring. Since the sensing devices are usually powered by battery, it is a great challenge to meet the requirement of long system lifetime for various applications with limited energy. In recent researches, coverage preserved scheduling scheme has been proposed to conserve energy and provide sensing quality. In the densely deployed sensor networks, the areas or data that are sensed by neighboring sensors may overlap. By selecting appropriate sensors into sleep state, the system lifetime can be extended without losing coverage. In this paper, we propose a distributed cluster-based coverage-preserved scheduling scheme. We divide sensors into clusters and group cluster members into sponsor sets based on neighbor information. The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach distributes the workloads among sponsor sets, ensures sufficient coverage and prolongs the system lifetime.

77952412011	Recent developments and experimental guidelines in mobile ad-hoc networks	The Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is one of the most vibrant and active current research topics. This work investigates and analyses recent research trends and presents experimental guidelines on MANETs. More than 1900 MANET-related papers were collected and surveyed in IEEE/IEE Electronic Library (IEL Online) from 1998 to 2004. The research trends, qualitative analysis and simulation guidelines from 15 major MANET issues are investigated to assist the user in conducting MANET research. On the basis of recent seven-year trends, we found that some issues, such as routing, power management and bandwidth management, have attracted much attention. We also found that some issues have potential study values, such as radio interface and security. In the qualitative analysis, we found that some factors such as scalability, stability and reliability attracted much attention in major MANET issues. The essential simulation metrics for various MANET issues are identified and listed for experimental guidelines. The analysis results also demonstrate the utilisation trends for various MANET simulators. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

77953667705	HarpiaGrid: A geography-aware grid-based routing protocol for vehicular Ad Hoc networks	Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is a research field attracting growing attention. Current routing protocols in VANETs usually use route discovery to forward data packets to the destination. In addition, if vehicle density is low in the network, there might not be vehicles available to deliver the packet. This paper proposes HarpiaGrid, a geography-aware grid-based routing protocol for VANETs. The protocol uses map data to generate a shortest transmission grid route, effectively trades route discovery communication overhead with insignificant computation time. By restricting packets in grid sequences rather than blindly greedy search and making use of route cache approach, HarpiaGrid reduces many unnecessary transmissions, thus greatly improving routing efficiency. Moreover, in the route maintenance, this work proposes a local recovery scheme and uses backtracking techniques to generate a new grid forwarding route, providing superior fault-tolerance capability. Experiments were conducted, and the results demonstrated that the proposed scheme is indeed more efficient than other protocols.

77955681440	A bandwidth-based power-aware routing protocol with low route discovery overhead in mobile ad hoc networks	In the design of power-aware on-demand routing protocols in mobile ad hoc networks, it must be taken into account that nodes may use a great amount of power to find the desired routing path during the path-discovery phase. In addition, in previous research on power-aware routing protocols, the path bandwidth was often not considered. In this paper, we tackle these issues by proposing a power-aware routing protocol with low route requests (LRR) to find a path with high path bandwidth. By making a low number of routing requests (RREQs), mobile nodes help to broadcast the routing request only when they first receive the routing requests. In addition, based on the receipt of the routing requests from the neighboring nodes, mobile nodes record the location information of its one-hop neighboring nodes. In the path-reply phase, mobile nodes in the found path use the collected location information of their neighbors and our proposed relay model to modify the found path so that the found path has high bandwidth. In our simulation, we compared our proposed routing protocol (LRR) with ad hoc on-demand distance vector, dynamic source routing and min-max battery capacity routing in terms of the following: power consumption in the path-discovery phase and the path-reply phase, bandwidth of the found path, power consumed during data transmission and overall power consumption. In addition, we compared our two proposed routing protocols, the minimum power consumption routing protocol that selects one path with minimum transmission power from all paths and the LRR routing protocol, in terms of the following: the power consumption in the path-discovery phase, the path bandwidth and the overall power consumption. From the simulation results and the analysis, we can see that the proposed LRR routing protocol that uses a low number of routing requests and our proposed relay model to improve path bandwidth can efficiently reduce the overall power consumption. © The Author 2009.

77958564902	Energy efficient hole bypassing routing in wireless sensor networks	In wireless sensor networks with holes(obstacIes), to identify holes and deliver data packets efficiently are challenging issues. Most existing researches require sensor nodes to exchange messages multiple times for hole identification and thus depleting energy of sensors. In some researches, even with the assumption of knowing the information of the hole, due to the lack of efficient hole bypassing routing considerations, sensors still consume excessive energy for hole bypassing and data packets may still fail to be delivered to the destination. In this paper, we design an effective hole identification mechanism and propose efficient hole bypassing routing scheme in wireless sensor networks with holes. With the proposed scheme, data packets are able to bypass holes and be delivered to the destination along a shorter path. Simulation results demonstrate that our scheme is more energy efficient and has a shorter average path length. © 2010 IEEE.

79952057952	An efficient traffic control system using dynamic thresholding techniques in wireless mesh networks	Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) depend on a resilient and high-performance infrastructure to provide users pervasive Internet access. In WMNs, all Internet traffic will be forwarded to the Internet gateways. Hence, these gateways are generally bottleneck nodes. This work proposes a traffic control technique to reduce the bottleneck problem and increase the utilization of network resources. Our approach provides a traffic control strategy that exploits dynamic techniques to adjust the threshold according to the traffic load of each gateway. The base threshold is defined in order to effectively control the traffic. When the current load exceeds the threshold of a gateway, the traffic redirection strategy is implemented by switching border nodes. The service regions can be adjusted for each gateway based on the traffic load. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic thresholding approaches can distribute the workloads of gateways and maintain the thresholds of any two gateways within a level range, making an in-band balance of load. Thus, our proposed scheme can handle the unnecessary traffic redirection and reduce the traffic control overhead for various distributions of traffic. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms other schemes in terms of packet delivery ratio and efficiency, especially in bursty traffic environments. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

79953040022	A cluster-based approach for efficient multi-source multicasting in MANETs	A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a distributed wireless network. The characteristics such as free mobility, self configuration, and fast deployment make MANETs suitable for various tasks. Multicasting can efficiently support a variety of applications and services. Most of existing multicast routing protocols in MANETs consider only one source in a multicast group and become inefficient when the protocol is extended to multi-source multicasting. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based multi-source multicast routing protocol to provide efficient multicasting in the multi-source multicast environment. The proposed shared forwarding cluster and cluster-based routing preserve forwarding efficiency as well as robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol maintains the delivery ratio without losing efficiency in the multi-source multicast environment. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

79955627084	A capacity-aware and multipath-supported traffic control framework for wireless mesh networks	To provide convenient wireless access, wireless mesh networks (WMNs) can be rapidly deployed and connected for mobile clients. Although route redirection traffic control schemes and dynamic routing metrics can be used to improve the performance of WMNs, more of the available network bandwidth will be consumed by control message exchange. This paper proposes a capacity-aware and multipath supported traffic control framework in WMNs. The proposed framework can be used to dispatch data traffic in a multipath manner to improve the utilization of wireless links and forwarding latency. A hierarchical queue architecture is proposed to monitor and classify network traffic without the effort of control message exchange. Our traffic control strategy, which is based on local minimization of the forwarding latency, consists of two phases to automatically adapt to the utilization rate of the network links. In the first phase, the incoming packets are dispatched to the lower level queues according to the Internet gateway capacity. In the second phase, the packets are dispatched to the related network links according to the link load. The current study implements the proposed traffic control system on NS2 for simulation and on Linux 2.6 for real traffic analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the throughput and reduces forwarding delay with an approximate minimum delay time. The results also show that the behavior of the long-term delay model can be applied to short-term traffic control methods in WMNs.

0036705593	An efficient distributed clustering scheme for ad-hoc wireless networks	In ad-hoc mobile radio networks, nodes are organized into non-overlapping clusters. These clusters are independently controlled and dynamically reconfigured when the topology changes. This work presents a Distributed Label clustering scheme (DL) that partitions nodes into clusters using a weight-based criterion. The DL scheme allows the border nodes to determine their roles first to avoid selecting unsuitable clusterheads. In order to resolve the clusterhead change problem, the DL scheme restricts the number of clusterhead changes. The DL scheme also restricts the size of the virtual backbone by reducing the number of clusters. This scheme is distributed and can be executed at each node with only the knowledge of one-hop neighbors. The simulation results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms other clustering schemes in terms of the number of clusters, stability of the clusters and control overhead when the topology changes.

80052398383	An efficient anycast scheme for discovering k services in cluster-based mobile ad hoc networks	Anycast is a one-to-any bidirectional transmission scheme that can be used to provide various service-oriented applications. However, traditional anycast cannot support some distributed applications that need to locate multiple servers such as network time protocols and threshold cryptography. Although there are some extended anycast schemes that can support the discovery of k services, they may cause high control overhead, low satisfaction ratio, or high searching latency when there are more service requesters and providers. The main reasons for these shortcomings are unknown service information and limited hierarchical structure. This work proposes an efficient anycast scheme, called AnyKast, for discovering k services in cluster-based mobile ad hoc networks. In the AnyKast scheme, an anycast tree based on the clustering and virtual backbone is established to reduce unnecessary message transmission. In the anycast tree, anycast clusterheads disseminate their information to certain specific nodes that take the service information and perform the service selection task instead of blindly searching. Furthermore, to decrease the cost of service information collection and maintenance, scope flooding is used to limit the information transmission, and information piggybacking and periodical inquiry mechanism are used to increase the service information accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can effectively discover services, reduce request and reply message control overhead, and lower the searching latency. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. This work proposes an efficient anycast scheme, called AnyKast, for discovering k services.

80053035369	A hybrid adaptive traffic control strategy in wireless mesh networks	Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) has been attracted significant attention due to achieve a wide-area wireless environment with flexible-configuration and low-cost properties. When WMNs is used as an infrastructure for Internet access, all network traffic from mesh routers will be forwarded to the gateways that are directly connected to the wired network. Communication in large-scale wireless networks may suffer capacity bottlenecks in the gateway and local congestions among the mesh routers. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a hybrid strategy which combines the gateway-based and path-based traffic control schemes. In order to obtain simple and efficient results, the k-level congestion awareness scheme is proposed which uses the fuzzy logic technique to estimate the gateway loading. The border nodes (BNs) will redirect partial traffic to adjacent regions that belong to neighbor gateways if congestion occurs. Therefore, the proposed scheme can adjust the network traffic automatically according to traffic condition that can smoothly and immediately share traffic load to neighbor gateways. The validity of the model has been demonstrated through simulation experiments. Our simulation results have also indicated that our scheme is a good choice for WMNs to support efficient congestion control, especially in bursty traffic environments. © 2011 IEEE.

81555213223	Design and implementation of a DSRC based vehicular warning and notification system	Many cities have established Web-based road hazard report/notification systems to improve citizen's driving safety and comfort. However, some of the systems are not very user-friendly. On the other hand, a driver sometimes does not know his/her vehicle already has some problems, but the malfunctioning vehicle is still driven on the road. Under this condition, the driver and other road users are all not very safe. This paper proposes a DSRC vehicular warning and notification system. The proposed system consists of multiple communication interfaces to provide real-time traffic warning and rapid notification of traffic information. It is capable of detecting road hazards and transmitting traffic information to the Internet through intervehicular communications via DSRC. In addition, the vehicular status self-check data can be acquired through Control Area Network (CAN) bus. With Web Services, the proposed system could report traffic information to city traffic centers for informing other road users, or car maintenance factories for car fault rescue. A prototype system was implemented, and the road test results show the proposed system can be used not only to enhance driving safety but also to simplify the notification of road problems. © 2011 IEEE.

84855176956	Hierarchical multicast in wireless sensor networks with mobile sinks	In most studies of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sensor nodes and sinks are typically stationary. However, mobile sinks are required in various applications of real-life environments, and delivering sensed data to mobile sinks using ordinary routing protocols is very inefficient. Multicasting is an important process in the minimization of the number of transmissions in WSNs. Since sensor nodes have limited resources, many studies have focused on how to send data to specific receivers efficiently. This work presents a grid-based hierarchical multicast (HM) routing protocol for WSNs with mobile sinks. Location servers (LSs) are adopted to manage the information about the locations of receivers and then a multicast tree is constructed distributively to reduce the update cost and energy consumed by sink mobility. The multicast tree can be shared by multiple sources, reducing the path construction overhead. Furthermore, effective maintenance mechanisms that make the multicast tree more stable and robust are presented. Finally, the performance of the proposed HM is investigated by simulation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol has a lower energy consumption and higher multicast efficiency than distributed multicast routing protocol (DMRP) and hierarchical geographic multicast routing (HGMR), especially when many sources and receivers are involved.

84859734580	Hierarchical ring-based data gathering for dense wireless sensor networks	Data gathering is an essential operation in wireless sensor networks. For periodic data gathering applications, each sensor node has data that must be sent to a distant base station in a round of communication. Due to the limited battery power of sensor nodes, each sensor node transmitting its sensed data to the base station directly significantly consumes its energy. This work presents a hierarchical ring-based data gathering (HRDG) scheme for dense wireless sensor networks. A hierarchical grid structure is constructed, and only some sensor nodes are elected as grid heads for gathering data, subsequently reducing the total energy consumption per round. Grid heads are then organized into hierarchical rings to decrease the transmission delay of a round. The proposed HRDG scheme focuses on reducing the energy × delay cost in a round of data gathering. Moreover, the energy × delay cost of HRDG is analyzed. Simulation results indicate that the proposed HRDG scheme outperforms other data gathering schemes in terms of the number of rounds, the energy × delay cost and coverage ratio. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84863945847	An efficient geo-aware peer-to-peer resource discovery and sharing scheme in vehicular ad-hoc networks	Vehicles may move at high speed in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) and the network topology changes arbitrarily as the nodes move. Vehicles may not find suitable resources because sharing information could quickly become obsolete or irrelevant resources. This paper proposes an efficient geo-aware Peer-to-Peer (P2P) search mechanism to enable resource discovery and sharing in VANETs. We propose discovery and sharing schemes based on the virtual backbone architecture, and then limit the data exchanging region to reduce unnecessary message transmissions. Because the resource node changes very fast, the coordinator must be set to maintain the local node of geographic information in the network. In this scheme, coordinators are established to store information and manage local resource information. In order to ensure dissemination performance, it must guarantee that vehicles possess enough resource pieces to allow efficient bartering. Furthermore, three kinds of piece selection mechanisms, including Nearest-First, Rarest-First, and In-Order are proposed to download resource pieces from other vehicles and to improve the dissemination efficiency. Experiment results demonstrate that our searching and sharing schemes are efficient and outperforms other schemes in terms of satisfactory ratio and download time. © 2012 IEEE.

84866368013	An energy-efficient routing protocol in wireless sensor networks with holes	In wireless sensor networks, holes may exist due to uneven deployment, energy exhaustion and physical obstacles. How to establish the energy-efficient routing mechanism in wireless sensor networks with holes is a practical and challenging issues. Many researches employ hole detection algorithm to determine boundary nodes, and then the holes are covered by some virtual shapes such as circles and ellipses. This usually leads to longer path length and more energy exhaustion. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient routing protocol in wireless sensor networks with holes. Only a few nodes need to determine whether it is a boundary node and a few anchor nodes are used to record the information of holes, thus reducing the energy consumption. In addition, the anchor nodes will be replaced when their residual energy is less than a threshold to prolong the network lifetime. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme has good performance in terms of energy consumption, control overhead and path length. © 2012 IEEE.

84874254727	A SWE-based network management framework for environment monitoring	Recently, owing to the attentions of environment issues, the environment monitoring technologies and applications are under rapid development. The research on environment monitoring can be divided into two major aspects: sensing data collection and heterogeneous system integration. With the improvement of sensing devices (e.g., precision, sensing range, Internet connectivity, and computation capability), the operational condition of device is also regarded as the environment information. In this study, an SNMP-based SWE management architecture is proposed. To unite the management of various debris-flow sensors, the entity MIB of debris-flow sensors is defined. Administrator could describe an object and its attributes to construct the tree-based SWE management architecture. This framework provides dynamically managed objects and standardizes the message management between the management system and sensors. Data access and collection are based on SWE standard message format, which is used to enhance exchangeability of sensing data and interoperability of the messages. In the proposed system, the SWE and SNMP services are integrated into Web service based interface, which provides real-time, seamless and remote management services. © 2012 IEEE.

However, due to the ever-shifting mobility of vehicle topology, vehicles moving along non-fixed routes may not find suitable next-hop vehicles. This paper proposes schemes to effectively circulate and discover service information with the aid of public transportation systems. Bus routes can be used to create a backbone structure on which data can be posted and circulated to avoid the broadcast storm problem. The proposed architecture can effectively disseminate and discover the required data through the traffic infrastructure and mobile vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms other schemes in terms of packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay. Moreover, the overhead of this scheme is less than other schemes with an increasing of number of service requests.

84886674690	A tree-based web service indication scheme for service tracking in vehicular ad-hoc networks	Due to the progress of modern automobiles, using vehicles as sensors to gather information is no longer an unreachable idea. Although the cost of providing services on a specific node is extremely high in Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANets), to locate a particular node and provide services in Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANets) is much easier than in MANets because vehicles are always limited on roads. Particularly, public transportation systems are very suitable for providing Web services. In our approach, we purpose a geo-aware tree-based service tracking scheme to locate the specific service in the particular area. The virtual backbone is predefined according to the main roads in the city. It consists of geo-grids and is further organized to a tree structure. The tree structure, which is the higher layer of the virtual backbone, can be used to facilitate service location tracking since any grid inside the tree has only one route to the root. Based on footprints left by services on the branches of tree, we can easily find the specific service and access data of interests on VANets. The footprints will be updated when the service move from one grid to another or be cleared when the service jump into another branch of the tree structure. © 2013 IEEE.

84903489020	A geo-aware location based taxi carrying system	Taxi is a flourishing industry recently. It plays an important role in many kinds of popular transportation systems because of the characteristic that can be hailed conveniently, and also provided location-based service. Most of the taxi drivers carried passengers by hunting on the road or waiting in a fixed taxi queuing point, but these patterns have poor performance. Furthermore, there are about eighty percent of vacant rate and many critical issues such as air pollution and foul up traffic in the past few years. This work proposed a taxi carrying system by using location-based service and on-air queuing point techniques, including on-air queuing point establishment, on-air queuing point management and path planning protocol. It can transmit information via WAVE/DSRC and demarcate taxi service area by transmission range of road side units. Combining the concept of on-air queuing point by Taiwan Taxi, taxi drivers can both hunt on road with geographic information efficiently and wait in queue when they are in the taxi service area. We emulated the module by PRISM which is a probability module analysis simulator, and proved that this pattern has better performance for carrying passengers and reducing waiting time compared with the real data which is from the investigation of the fixed waiting point in Taiwan High Speed Rail Teaching Station. On the other hand, we design a prototype about taxi on-air queuing system. Drivers can get newest information immediately through user interface, and find passenger as soon as possible. © 2014 IEEE.

Many studies about data dissemination have been proposed. However, most of them are not energy-efficient, especially in large-scale networks. Hence, in this paper the authors proposed an energy-efficient data dissemination scheme in large-scale wireless sensor networks. First, the authors design a data storage method which disseminates only a few amount event data by dividing the network into regions and levels, and thus reducing the energy consumption. Then, the authors develop an efficient sink query forwarding strategy by probability analysis so that a sink can query events easily according to its location to reduce the delay time of querying event data, as well as energy consumption. In addition, a simple and efficient maintenance mechanism is also provided.
