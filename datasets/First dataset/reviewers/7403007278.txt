Small addition of Sc can enhance the age hardening response of the Al-15Ag alloy while the time needed to attain the ageing peak is prolonged. TEM observations show that the morphology of γ' precipitation can be modified by the small addition of Sc; also noted is a refinement of γ' precipitates in Al-15Ag-0.2Sc.

8844229632	Exfoliation corrosion susceptibility of 8090 Al-Li alloy examined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy	The exfoliation corrosion susceptibility and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of rolled and peak-aged 8090 Al-Li alloys in EXCO solution were studied, and the EIS after exfoliation was simulated. Once exfoliation occurs, two capacitive arcs appear in the EIS at high-mediate frequency and mediate-low frequency respectively. The exfoliation-attacked alloy surface consists of two parts, an original flat alloy surface and a new interface exposed to EXCO solution due to the exfoliation. The capacitance corresponding to the new exfoliation interface increases approximately linearly with time at early exfoliation stage, due to the enlargement of the new interface. Then it maintains stable, due to the corrosion product covering on the new interface. The exfoliation susceptibility can be judged through the average slope of the capacitance vs time curve of the early exfoliation stage. This average slope of the rolled 8090 alloy is much higher than that of the peak-aged 8090 alloy, accordingly the rolled 8090 alloy is more susceptible to exfoliation than the peak-aged 8090 alloy.

The results indicate that the age hardening response of the Al-2.5Cu-l.5Mg alloy can be enhanced while the general form of the ageing curve is not altered by small addition of Sc. TEM observations show that GPB can only precipitated during the second age hardening period which will make a great contribution to the age hardening, and the morphology of GPB can be modified by the small addition of Sc, which does result in a refinement of the distribution of GPB in Al-2.5Cu-l.5Mg-0.2Sc.

The results indicate that external stress promotes the formation of clusters of solute atoms or GP zones, but retards the growth of θ and Ω phases. A critical phenomenon that the microstructural evolution will be modified at a certain external stress value is found in Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloy. The applied external stress during aging induces preferentially oriented precipitations of θ and Ω in Al-Cu and Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloys, respectively. The origin of stress-induced orientation effect is understood by analyzing interaction between external stress and misfit strain by Eshelby elastic inclusion theory.

14844364298	Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy during corrosion process of 8090 Al-Li alloy in EXCO solution	The corrosion behavior and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) features of 8090 Al-Li alloys in EXCO solution were investigated, and the EIS was simulated using an equivalent circuit. At the beginning of immersion in EXCO solution, the EIS is comprised by a depressed capacitive arc at high-mediate frequency and an inductive arc at low frequency, and the inductive component decreases and disappears with immersion time. Once exfoliation or severe pitting corrosion is produced, two capacitive arcs appear in the EIS. These two capacitive arcs are originated from the two parts of the corroded alloy surface, the original flat alloy surface and the new inter-face exposed to the aggressive EXCO solution due to the exfoliation or pitting corrosion. Some corrosion development features of 8090 Al-Li alloys in EXCO solution can be obtained through simulated EIS information.

In accord with these principles, a modified transition probability considering the influence of temperature was put forward to simulate the normal grain growth relying on temperature and second phase particles. The modified transition probability correctly reflects the dependence of grain growth on the temperature. The effect of different shapes of second phase particles on the grain growth process was taken into account using the modified transition probability. The relationship between the area fraction of second phase particles and the limit of grain size of the matrix was given. The microstructural evolution patterns employed to 2-D were given. The results agree well with the real grain growth process. All these suggest that the modified transition probability is better than the conventional one.

17644426682	Effect of aging on mechanical properties and localized corrosion behaviors of Al-Cu-Li all	The effects of aging on mechanical properties, intergranular corrosion and exfoliation corrosion behaviors of a 2197 type Al-Li alloy were investigated, and the mechanisms were studied through microstructure observation and electrochemical measurement of simulated bulk phase. The main strengthening precipitates of the alloy aged at 175°C and 160°C are δ′ and T1. T1 precipitation in the alloy aged at 160°C is delayed, which results in its slower age strengthening and over-aging behavior than the alloy aged at 175°C. Meanwhile, aging temperature of 160°C causes more uniform distribution and finer size of T1, resulting in its better strengthening effect. As aging time and aging temperature are increased, the size of T1 at grain boundaries and the width of PFZ along grain boundaries are increased, leading to an increase in the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion and exfoliation corrosion. It is suggested that better comprehensive properties can be obtained when the alloy is aged at 160°C.

The results of the investigations show that RRA treatment retains the strength of 7055-T6 with a higher electrical conductivity close to that of 7055-T73, but its elongation decreases greatly; SEM fractographs reveal that intergranular cracking and shear-type transgranular cracking were both present on the fracture appearance of 7055-T6 specimen. After T73 treatment, the fractographs consist of dimple-type transgranular cracking with minor intergranular cracking. With 7055-RRA specimen, intergranular cracking dominates with minor dimples distributed on the fracture surface.

The effects of pressing pressure on the microstructure and properties of the materials were investigated. The results show that thermal conductivity of the composites increases with pressing pressure as a result of improvements of densities and interface bonding, but a very high pressure can lead to many microcracks in Si particles, and then reduce thermal conductivities. An exothermic progress exists in Si/Al system under high pressing pressure at about 945°C. It mainly indicates the interface reaction between Al and silicon dioxide after the fracture of aluminum oxide film, which is encouraged by the boundary defect energy caused by high pressing pressure. Exothermic reaction improves the wettability of this system.

The results showed that low temperature secondary ageing could increase microhardness and strength of 7055 Al alloy after preliminary ageing at 120°C, 150°C and 180°C. Increasing of the secondary ageing temperature from 60°C to 100°C could accelerate the response of secondary hardening and strengthening, but deteriorate fracture toughness of 7055 Al alloy. Reducing of the preliminary temperature and the time was more favorable to the improvement in strength and toughness of 7055 Al alloy.

24344461440	Investigation of secondary ageing characteristics of 7055 aluminum alloy-(II) microstructures and fractography	Based on TEM and SEM observation, the effect of secondary ageing on microstructures and Kahn tear fractographs of 7055 Al alloy was investigated. The experimental results show that the solute atoms which did not precipitated during preliminary ageing precipitate again during secondary ageing at lower temperature. The growth and coarsening rate of the precipitates became slower due to lower secondary ageing temperature, which resulted in higher precipitate density and strength than that of single step ageing. During secondary ageing at higher temperature higher strength was received due to the precipitation of η' phases. Shorter preliminary ageing time and lower preliminary ageing temperature was beneficial to the retention of remnant vacancies and solute atoms, which contributed to quicker age hardening response. Preliminary and secondary ageing at lower temperature resulted in small amount of discontinuous grain boundary precipitates. As a result, the fracture toughness of the alloy is improved. However, increasing secondary ageing temperature promotes the precipitation of grain boundary precipitates resulted in bad fracture toughness.

The specimens after solid solution and quenched in water have higher strength and anisotropy extents than that of samples quenched in air when the aging time are the same; and the anisotropy extent of the specimens quenched in air will increase slightly with the aging time increasing.

The simulation results show that; there are Li-clusters, Li-Cu co-clusters and vacancy-clusters in Al-Cu-Li alloy during the initial ageing stage, and Li clusters exhibit a tendency to co-existed with vacancy clusters; with small addition of Mg, Cu clusters are provoked, while the clustering of Li atoms is restrained, the vacancy clusters have a tendency to co-existed with Cu-Mg co-clusters. Small addition of Mg has strongly effect on the morphology of Li clusters, which can release Cu atoms and vacancies from the locking-state by Li clusters.

Results show that the solution of Mg and Al in solid β phase, the hardness of the alloy is increased, the Mg-Li alloy has been softened, due to precipitation of a and AlLi from β phase during the aging process after quenching at 350°C, and the higher aging temperature accelerates the softening process. Meanwhile, the alloy's strength was increased due to solution increasing when the quenching temperature is reached to 250°C. However, a higher quenching temperature of 350°C results in the alloy's grain coarsening; a phase precipitates easily along β grains, due to super-saturation of Mg in β phase as quenched at 350°C. As a result, the tensile strength and ductility of the Mg-Li alloy were decreased largely.

As immersion time is increased, two capacitive arcs appear in the high-mediate and mediate-low frequency ranges respectively and the appearance time of two capacitive arcs could be an indication of the speed of localized corrosion development in EXCO solution.

34548749170	Localized corrosion mechanism associated with precipitates containing Mg in Al alloys	To clarify the localized corrosion mechanism associated with precipitates containing Mg in Al alloys, the simulated bulk precipitates of S and β were synthesized through melting and casting. Their electrochemical behaviors and coupling behaviors with α(Al) in NaCl solution were measured. Meanwhile, simulated Al alloys containing S and β particles were prepared and their corrosion morphologies were observed. It's found that there exist two kinds of corrosion mechanisms associated with precipitates containing Mg. The precipitate of β is anodic to the alloy base, resulting in its anodic dissolution and corrosion during the whole corrosion process. While, there exists a corrosion conversion mechanism associated with the S precipitate, which contains active element Mg and noble element Cu simultaneously. At an initial stage, S is anodic to the alloy matrix at its periphery and the corrosion occurs on its surface. However, during its corrosion process, Mg is preferentially dissolved and noble Cu is enriched in the remnants. This makes S become cathodic to α(Al) and leads to anodic dissolution and corrosion on the alloy base at its periphery at a later stage. © 2007 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

35148894212	Effect of microelements on the microstructural evolution of Al-Ag alloys during initial aging stage by kinetic Monte Carlo model	The kinetic Monte Carlo method based on the Multi-States Ising Model, was applied to simulate the effect of microelements on the microstructural evolution of Al-Ag alloys during initial aging stage. The results show that the microelement In, Sn and Be have dramatic depression effects on the Ag clustering due to strong tendency to coexist with vacancy clusters. The Mg has a little depression effect on the Ag clustering compared to In, Sn and Be. There are Mg-Ag co-clusters and Ag-Mg-vacancy co-clusters in the Al-Ag alloy containing Mg. The interactions between Mg and Ag, Mg and Vacancy, lead to the restrained Ag clustering. The Li and Cd have little interaction with Ag and vacancy, so they influence Ag clustering slightly. The microelements influence the atom segregation during aging mainly by the interaction of vacancy and solute atoms of precipitated phase. The interaction of microelements and vacancy play a more important role. The 'single vacancy locked' and 'vacancy clusters collapse' are two important mechanisms to affect the aging process by vacancy mobility.

34948844639	Precipitation and coarsening of coherent and ordered second phase during stress aging by using phase-filed simulations	The microstructural evolution during the precipitation and coarsening of the ordered second phase in multiparticle coherent systems under stress applied is simulated using the phase-field methods. The results show that the rafted microstructures develop as a result of directional coarsening when uniaxial loads are applied. The rafting direction is depended on the applied load, the lattice misfit between the γ and γ′ phases and the differences between the elastic constants of the two phases. When the volume fractions of the second phase become large, the coalescence and antiphase domain boundary (APB) will have more pronounced effects on the morphologies of the second phase. There are two mechanisms responsible for the particle alignment: the first is the solution of particles out of chains and the second is the migration of particles. Most of chains are established firstly through the first mechanism, then the second one to further alignment.

35548963503	Heat resistant properties of 2197 Al-Li alloy	The tensile properties at elevated temperatures and the room-temperature properties after long time thermal exposure of 2197 alloy were studied. Microstructures of 2197 alloy after long time thermal exposure at different temperatures were observed by TEM. The results show that the tensile strength at elevated temperatures decreases with increasing test temperature, and the tensile properties at 200°C are higher than those of traditional aluminum alloy used at elevated temperature. After exposure at temperatures below 150°C for 100 h, the mechanical properties of 2197 alloy increase slightly. This is related to the high coarsening resistance of T1 phase and secondary precipitation of θ′ phase at these temperatures. However, after exposure at 200°C and 250°C for 100 h, the mechanical properties of 2197 alloy decrease rapidly due to the dissolution of θ′ phase and rapid coarsening of T1 phase at these temperatures.

The fracture morphology and precipitates by low strain tensile were observed with SEM and TEM, respectively. The results show that the precipitates are GP+η' phase, η' phase+η' phase, and η phase for the aging conditions of T6, RRA and T73, respectively. The precipitates size inside grains and on the grain boundary and the width of PFZ on the grain boundary increase in turn, and the distribution of precipitates on the grain boundary alters from continuously needle-shaped to discontinuously globular. These microstructural characteristics endow the new alloys by different aging conditions with different stress corrosion resistances, mechanical properties and fracture morphologies.

The results indicate that epoxy polymeric network I and polyurethane polymeric network II are formed in the PU-modified TDE-85/MeTHPA epoxy resin. Meanwhile the PU-modified TDE-85/MeTHPA resins have heterogeneous structure. The miscibility between epoxy (EP) and polyurethane (PU) as well as the phase size are dominantly determined by the mass fraction of polyurethane prepolymer (PUP) in the EP/PU blends. With the increase of PUP mass fraction, the tensile strength, impact strength and thermal stability of the PU-modified TDE-85/MeTHPA epoxy resin all firstly exhibit increasing tendency, and decrease after successively reaching their maxima. When the number-average molecular mass of PPG is 1 000 and the mass fraction of PUP is 15%, the tensile strength, impact strength and thermal stability of materials obtained, compared with TDE-85/MeTHPA epoxy resin, are improved obviously. © 2007 Published by: Central South University Press, Sole distributor outside Mainland China: Springer.

The investigation showed that spot corrosion of the alloy with different aging treatment occurred almost at the same time, and the exfoliation of samples with T8 aged look was shorter than that of T6 aged alloy. The EIS of samples in EXCO solution was comprised by a depressed capacitive arc at high frequency and an inductive arc at low frequency without exfoliation while after exfoliation the EIS was comprised of two capacitive arcs at high frequency and at low frequency, respectively. The mechanics and phenomenon of corrosion was analysised with microstructure, which showed that the smaller capacity and homogenous distribution of precipitates in T8 alloy because of the deforming before aging can hindrance the occurring of exfoliation effectively.

34247637335	Special epoxy silicone adhesive for inertial confinement fusion experiment	The effects of toughener and coupling agent on special epoxy silicone adhesive were discussed by researching the surface morphology characters, thermal properties and shear strength of the adhesive. The results indicate that silicone coupling agent (KH-550) can improve the shear strength of the epoxy silicone adhesive effectively. The mass fraction of the toughener in the epoxy silicone adhesive plays an important role in its properties. When the mass fraction of the toughener is less than 14%, the shear strength of the adhesive is low. When the mass fraction of the toughener is over 33%, thermal properties and shear strength of the adhesive decrease with the increasing of the toughener. The mass fraction of toughener of 25% results in good integral properties of the epoxy silicone adhesive. The morphologic analysis indicates that the micro-phase separation exists in the epoxy molecular chain and the silicone molecular chain of the epoxy silicone adhesive. © Published by: Central South University Press, Sole distributor outside Mainland China: Springer 2007.

Microstructure of ML377 alloy after long thermal exposure at different temperature was observed by TEM. The results show that the tensile strength at elevated temperatures decreases with increasing test temperature, and tensile property at 200t is better than that of traditional aluminum alloy used at elevated temperature. The mechanical properties of ML377 alloy keep stable alter thermal exposure at 107°C and 150°C. This is because of the high coarsening resistance of T1 phase at these temperatures. However, at 200°C thermal exposure condition, T1 phase in the alloy coarsens obviously and part of it transforms into stable phase, which causes the mechanical properties of ML377 alloy decrease rapidly.

The results show that the aging hardening response of 2197 alloy increases obviously with the increase of plastic deformation after quenching, which enhanced the peak-aged tensile strength. And this effect becomes more obvious with the pre-deformation ratio increasing. The plastic deformation remarkably promotes the matrix T1 precipitation and makes its distribution more dispersive and homogeneous. Meanwhile, the precipitation of θ"/θ' and δ' is limited.

The effect of specimen orientation on the crack propagation rates was less significant. The fatigue crack propagation rates of the specimens in the L-T orientation and T-L orientation were similar. However, the stress ratio had a remarkable influence on the fatigue crack propagation rates; at the higher stress ratio, the fatigue crack propagation rates increased and the fatigue crack propagated rapidly into the high crack propagation regime to failure at lower ΔK levels. The effect of stress ratio at near-threshold levels could be explained by a crack closure concept. © 2010, Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research. Published by Elsevier BV.

After further solution and peak-ageing treatment, the newly produced 6061 Al sheets exhibited markedly higher mechanical properties (ultimate tensile strength (UTS): 454. MPa, yield strength (YS): 438. MPa and elongation (El): 13%) than those of the conventionally produced ones (UTS: 384. MPa, YS: 368. MPa and El: 11%). The quantitative estimation of strengthening mechanisms indicated that the increased peak-ageing strength of the newly processed 6061 alloy sheets was mainly attributed to their high average Taylor factor value, which resulted from the P texture with high volume fraction. Furthermore, the fracture characteristics of the newly produced and peak-aged 6061 alloy sheets were dominated by dimple induced cracking accompanied by small amount of intergranular cracking.

Meanwhile, simulated Al-Cu-Li alloys containing T1 and T2 particles, respectively, were prepared and their corrosion morphologies were observed. A corrosion conversion mechanism associated with the precipitates of T1 and T2 was advanced. The precipitates of T1 and T2 are anodic to the alloy base and corrosion occurs on their surface at the beginning. While, during their corrosion process, the preferential dissolution of Li and the enrichment of noble element Cu make their potential move to a positive direction. As a result, the corroded T1 and T2 precipitates become cathodic to the alloy base at a later stage, leading to the anodic dissolution and corrosion of the alloy base at their adjacent periphery. However, due to more amount of active element Li and much less amount of noble element Cu in the precipitate of T2, the electrode conversion of T2 from anode to cathode is more superficial than that of T1, and the corrosion mainly occurs in T2. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The fractographies and the characteristics of ageing precipitation were investigated using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The results show that the fatigue cracks are initiated around the coarse secondary phases on the free surfaces of the specimens. After over-ageing treatment, the equilibrium S phases precipitate the reversible movement of dislocations and further intensify their piles-up on the grain boundaries. On the other hand, the presence of wider PFZs and needle-shaped S phases on grain boundaries accelerate the localized deformation within PFZs and fast cracking along the grain boundary S phases. Therefore, the fatigue properties of the overaged specimens are deteriorated compared with that of the under-ageing specimens.

The experimental results show that the fraction of equilibrium pre-precipitates in the matrix reduces gradually and the fraction of solute atoms increases with the rise of pre-precipitation temperature. Therefore, the number of meta-equilibrium precipitates at 120°C, 24 h artificial ageing increase, which led to higher strength and lower electrical conductivity of 7050 aluminum alloy. Shear-able metaequilibrium precipitates and non-shear-able equilibrium precipitates impose different dragging forces on sliding dislocations, which contributes to different tensile fractography.

The results show that RRA treatment retains strength of 7055-T6 with higher electrical conductivity close to that of 7055-T73 alloy, but its elongation decreases greatly. SEM fractographs reveal that intergranular cracking and shear-type transgranular cracking are both presented on the fracture appearance of 7055-T6 specimen. After T73 treatment, the fractographs mainly consist of dimple-type transgranular cracking with minor intergranular cracking. For 7055-RRA specimen, intergranular cracking dominates with minor dimples on the fracture surface.

The experimental results show that the electric conductivity of the over-aged alloy in 120°C×3 h+180°C×8 h temper decreases with the increase of re-solution temperature after re-solution in the range of 440°C-490°C×1 h and 120°C×24 h re-aging, but the strength lowers correspondingly. Prolonging over-aging time from 180°C×4-20 h slightly increases the electric conductivity of the alloy re-solutioned at 470°C for 1 h and decreases its strength. TEM observation reveals that the coarse precipitates formed during over-aging do not dissolve fully, providing the alloy with microstructure and properties similar to that by retrogression and reaging treatment.

Fine η′ precipitate with high density was obtained in the alloy with the T6 and RRA treatments. The η′ precipitate density in the HTPP aged alloy is decreased due to the formation of coarse particles during the pre-precipitation process at high temperature of 445 °C. The 7075-T6I6 alloy possesses higher precipitate density and whole precipitate volume fraction within the grain than the 7075-T73 alloy, and its whole precipitate volume fraction is even greater than that of the 7075-T6 alloy. Compared with T6 treatment, the RRA, T73, T6I6 and HTPP aging treatments cause the discontinuous distribution of the η precipitates at the grain boundary, which decreases the intergranular corrosion and exfoliation corrosion susceptibility of the alloy. Meanwhile, the T6I6 and RRA treatments can keep the high strength of the 7075 Al alloy, but the studied HTPP aging and T73 treatments lower its strength. © 2008 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

The results showed that the tendence to decrease in strength of the alloy became relatively slower after retrogression at 180°C for various times and reaging at 120°C for 24 h. With increase of retrogression temperature to 200°C and 220°C, the strength of the alloy after retrogression and reaging decreased rapidly. The above results were due to the addition of Ag, which increased the solvus temperature from 120-140°C to 200°C. As a result, GP zone coarsened at 180°C but reversed at 200°C and 220°C, and accelerated the formation of η phase. Pre-aging for 12 h and 24 h at 120°C could form more η′ than that of pre-aging for 18 h at the initial 180°C retrogression stage, and higher strength was the consequent result. The different trends of change in strength were attributed to coarsening of η′ phase into η phase during prolonged retrogression and reaging.

The results indicate that only sliver addition has almost no effect on the age-hardening and strengthening of the baseline alloy upon aging at 175°C. At peak aging state the main precipitates are both coarse T1 and θ′ phases for the Ag-bearing alloy and the baseline alloy. The Mg-containing alloy has a faster aging response and higher aging-strengthening effect than the baseline alloy. GP zone, θ′ and T1 are formed at different aging stages. The combined addition of Ag and Mg to the alloy greatly accelerates T1 precipitation, resulting in increasing density of T1 precipitates. The high volume fraction of T1 phase causes 2050 alloy having the highest strength. The independent and combined roles of small addition of Ag and Mg can be interpreted in terms of the solute-vacancy interaction and solute-solute atom interaction. © 2009, Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research.

AA7150 was retrogressed at different temperatures (175 °C, 185 °C and 195 °C) for various times. It is found that as the hardness of the retrogressed AA7150 approaches the near-peak condition, the corresponding RRA treated AA7150 possesses good exfoliation corrosion resistance without strength loss. By retrogressing at 175 °C, the retrogression time can be extended to 3 h, the RRA treated AA7150 possesses a strength as high as that of conventional AA7150-T6, and its exfoliation corrosion resistance is in the vicinity to that of AA7150-T73. This enhanced exfoliation corrosion resistance was associated with the more separated η precipitates at the grain boundary. AA7150-T6 is mainly strengthened by fine GP zones with high number density, while the intra-grain micro-structure of AA7150-RRA retrogressed at 175 °C for 3 h is characterized by relatively coarse η′ precipitates. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

0035477880	Retrogression and reaging treatment of a 7055 type aluminum alloy	The influence of heat treatment on the tensile properties, microstructure and resistance to SCC of a 7055 type aluminum alloy was investigated using aging curves measurement, slow strain tensile test and TEM observations. The results show that RRA treatment can provide the microstructure of a T6 temper in the matrix and the grain boundary precipitate structure possessed of a overaged(T7) condition. Thus strength of the alloy can be achieved the levels of T6 temper and the resistance to SCC better than that of T6 temper. Improved resistance to SCC by the RRA treatment is believed to result from the large coarsening grain boundary precipitates, which form during RRA treatment and can inhibite hydrogen embrittlement and decrease the electrochemical difference between grain boundaries and grain interior.

The results show that with decreasing W content and increasing preheat temperature, the combustion temperature and combustion velocity increases, the SHS reaction becomes complete and the particle size of product increases. There exist two combustion mechanisms. When Ti powder in combustion front was molten by high combustion temperature, SHS product was formed by melt-solution-precipitation mechanism. When the combustion temperature was not high enough to make Ti powder melt in combustion front, the product was formed through diffusion-solution-in-solid-state.

In the range of Ar gas pressure between 0.1-0.3 MPa, increasing the pressure can deter the expansion and craze of combustion sample and increase synthesized carbon content, which is helpful to control the free carbon content of the (W, Ti) C.

The results indicate that the age hardening response can be enhanced by the trace Si addition as well as Ag. The Monte Carlo simulation results show that the addition of Si results in a refinement of Mg clusters and Cu-Mg clusters, and the addition of Ag promotes the formation of lots of Mg-Ag clusters. Trace Si and Ag additions significantly alter the clustering process during early stages of ageing, resulting in different microstructural evolution processes during subsequent aging process.

The experiment results show that a lot of new cubic phases precipitate when the alloy is aged under the peak-aged condition of (T6, 170°C), but this case dose not be found in the alloys aged under the peak-aged conditions of (T6, 120°C) and (T6, 190°C). There exists a competitive precipitation relationship between T1 phase and cubic phase, which is restricted by the factors of temperature and pre-deformation. Monte Carlo method was used to simulate the atom distribution in the alloy during initial aging stage and analyze the forming mechanism of the cubic phase. The simulation results show that during the initial aging stage of (T6, 170°C), the Cu-Mg atom enrichment zones around Mg-Zn clusters become the perfect nucleate points for the cubic phase formation. Meanwhile, the higher vacancy concentration around Mg clusters is beneficial to quick solute diffusion. Thus, the Mg-Zn atom clusters may be the key factor of the formation of cubic phase.

The fatigue crack initiation and propagation behavior were observed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicate that 2524 alloy shows superior fatigue properties. The fatigue strength is up to 80% of the yield strength. The fatigue crack mainly initiates from the second phase particles and the interface between the second phase particles and matrix. The crack plane deflection in the process of crack propagation relates to the resistance of the grain boundary. The difference of crystallographic orientation between the two favoured slip planes within the two neighboring grains is an important factor to control crack propagation across a grain boundary.

77952609144	Effects of two-step ageing treatment on tensile properties and intergranular corrosion of 6061 aluminum alloy	Effects of two-step ageing treatment on tensile properties and intergranular corrosion(IGC) of 6061 aluminum alloy were investigated by tensile test, intergranular corrosion test, optical microscopy and TEM observation. The experimental results show that ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and elongation of 6061 alloy in T6 temper are 348.4 MPa, 320.3 MPa and 13.7%, respectively. However, the serious intergranular corrosion occurs with corrosion depth of about 270 μm. As a result of two-step ageing treatment, the strength decreases and the conductivity increases with the increase of two-step ageing temperature and time, but the mode of corrosion changes from intergranular corrosion to pitting corrosion (PC) while the corrosion depth decreases. Under the optimum two-step ageing treatment of (180°C, 8 h)+(210°C, 2 h), the ultimate strength, yield strength and elongation are 348.4 MPa, 320.3 MPa and 11.3%, respectively.

In this paper, the effect of T6I6 temper on tensile and intergranular corrosion properties of 6061 aluminum alloy was investigated by tensile test, intergranular corrosion test, OM and TEM. The experimental results show that after T6 temper the ultimate strength and yield strength of 6061 alloy are 356.0 and 331.6 MPa respectively, but it has a serious tendency to intergranular corrosion sensitivity. It is found that pre-ageing time of T6I6 temper has no remarked effect on tensile properties of the alloy, but interrupted temperature and interrupted time have obvious effects on its tensile and intergranular corrosion properties. After T6I6 treatment, the tensile strength of 6061 aluminium alloy reaches its peak strength firstly and then decreases to a small value with the increase of interrupted time after pre-ageing at interrupted temperature of 150°C, and the corrosion mode also changes from intergranular to uniform corrosion. Higher interrupted temperature and longer interrupted time are beneficial to achieve a good combinization of tensile properties and intergranular corrosion resistance, which results from the high density of precipitates inside grains and discontinuously distributed precipitates on grain boundaries. After an optimum T6I6 treatment of 180°C×2 h+150°C×2160 h+180°C×8 h, the ultimate strength and yield strength are 348.5 and 326.9 MPa respectively, close to those after T6 temper. The corrosion mode is changed from the intergranular corrosion of 6061 Al alloy after T6 temper to a uniform etching with the etching depth about 30 μm. © Copyright.

The results show that the formability of 6022 alloy containing 0.35% (mass fraction) Ag in T4 condition is declined a little, and after 30 min paint-bake aging at 175°C, higher strength can be obtained.

Results show that additions of Mg and Zn can accelerate the precipitation of δ' phase nucleation and inhibit its growth, so the δ' phase becomes finer and more dispersive. In the under-aging condition, a lot of GP zones are formed in the alloy containing Mg and Zn. The alloy only containing Mg also has many GP zones. But no GP zone is found in the alloy only containing Zn, while only a few coarse θ' is found. The above results reveal that Mg promotes the formation of GP zones while the single role of Zn is not significant; Zn has a better effect when it acts with Mg together. As the aging proceeding, GP zones in the alloy containing Mg and Zn transforms into θ'/θ″ phase and plenty of θ'/θ″ phases are formed in the alloy only containing Mg, but θ' phase dose not change obviously in the alloy only containing Zn. It indicates that Mg is the key element to accelerate θ'/θ″ phase formation, and Zn can promote the formation only with Mg.

The results show that either after conventional RRA treatment or after continuous RRA treatment, the alloy is composed of a large number of metstable η'phase precipitates and a few η phase precipitates in grains; η phase precipitates are coarsened seriously and PFZ (precipitate free zone) appears at the grain boundaries; the electrical conductivity is greatly increased during the retrogression step. In addition, after the first step treatment without air cooling, heated to the retrogression temperature at a proper heating rate, the 7A55 alloy can obtain the strength near the first step aging levels together with the electrical conductivity of 38.1%IACS in continuous RRA treatment.

Moreover, the effects of the Mg and Zn in 2099 alloy on the microstructure and properties of alloy were studied. The results show that under T6 peak aged condition, the dominant precipitates are δ', θ' and T1 phases. While under T8 peak aged condition, the major precipitates contain δ ' phase, T1 phase and θ' phase with small volume fractions. The pre-stretching prior to ageing promotes the precipitation of T1 phase, thus improves ageing strengthening. Mg addition promotes the precipitation of GP zone and θ' phase while Zn facilitates T1 phase precipitation. The addition of Mg together with Zn stimulates the formation of T1 phase obviously, and suppresses the coarsening progress of δ' phase.

The optimized double aging treatment of 7A55 alloy pre-stretch plate are as follows: T7651:121°C × 5 h+170°C × 6 h, T7451:121°C × 5 h+160°C × 14 h. The TEM observation results show that semi-coherent η' and η precipitates in matrix, and the coarse and isolate precipitations in grain boundaries in T7451 and T7651 tempers, contribute to improved corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity of the alloy.

The results show that in T65l condition the main precipitates are GP zones and η' phase in the matrix, and the grain boundary precipitates distribute continuously. In T651 condition the strength of 7A55 alloy plate is the highest; however the alloy has a serious tendency to exfoliation corrosion and very high sensitivity to stress corrosion crack. In T7351 condition the coarse rod-like η precipitates are mainly observed in the matrix and the grain boundary precipitates are coarse obviously and distribute sparsely. So, the corrosion resistance is the highest but the strength decreases to the lowest level. In T7651 and T7451 conditions, both η' and η precipitates exist in the matrix, and the coarse and isolate precipitates present in the grain boundaries, which contributes to the improvement of the corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity, while the decrease of tensile strength is small.

The corrosion resistence of the alloy under T8 condition was better than that under T6 condition, because lower aging temperatured and pre-deformation prior to aging promoted T1 phase precipitation and minimize PFZ at grain boundaries.

The effects of pre-aging at 140°C for different time on the formative and mechanical properties of 6022 aluminum alloy for automotive body sheets were studied by the hardness test, tensile test, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. It is found that, with the pre-aging time increase, the formative of 6022 alloy decrease, while the mechanical properties increase. When the pre-aging time is 5 min, 10 min and 30 min, σ0.2 increases 13, 22 and 26 MPa and σb increases 10, 21 and 33 MPa, respectively, average plastic strain ratio (r̄), strain strengthen index n and elongation rate decrease. 6022 alloy with superior formative and mechanical properties can be obtained after pre-aged at 140°C for 10 min. Stable Mg-Si atomic clusters formed after pre-aging at 140°C can serve as nucleation sites for the β″ phase in subsequent artificial aging.

The results indicate that the formation of coarse compound phases in the casts is accelerated with the addition of Mn and Cr, and the effect of Mn is more significant in both Mn-containing and Mn- and Cr-containing alloys. The phase transformation of Al5FeSi to Al8Fe2Si during homogenization is accelerated by the addition of Mn or Cr, and the combination addition of Mn and Cr is the most effective. The recrystallization and grain growth of the alloys are inhibited during solution treatment by the addition of Cr and Mn.

TTT curves and the kinetic expresses of metastable phases for Al-Mg-Si-(Cu) alloy were further gained.

The results indicate that fatigue crack initiation is related to stress. Under smaller stress, fatigue cracks mainly initiate from the second phase particles and the interface between the second phase particles and matrix as well as from the surface defect. While with larger stress, fatigue cracks easily initiate from the grain boundary and the slip band. Fatigue cracks grow along the favorable slip plane with priority. When the favorable slip planes in the adjacent grains have an angle, the crack deflects. The coherent δ' particles that can be sheared by dislocation result in the crack path meandering in the grain. The cracks grow mainly in transgranular mode along the (111) plane, and also along the small-angle grain boundaries. © 2011, Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research.

In addition, the morphology of impact fracture surface observed by SEM. The results indicate that impact energy of ZA27 alloy is reduced with the temperature rising when the temperature is lower than 100°C. At 100°C to 200°C, impact energy increase as the temperature rising. And when the temperature reaches to 250°C, impact energy suddenly descend. Impact energy is the highest and reaches to 72.768J at 20°C. At impact fracture surface, it is mostly tear ridges and dimples. The higher the impact energy is, the more obvious the characteristic of tear ridges is. Furthermore, dimples are small and distribute more uniformly. Lower the impact energy, the less distinct of tear ridges. Dimples are larger and deeper, their distribution are not uniform. Impact behavior of material could be evaluated by the width of impact curve. The wider the peak of impact curve, the higher the impact toughness.

The results show that trace Zn distributes uniformly in the alloy and it can promote the precipitation of S' phase which can improve the strength and decrease the electrochemistry corrosion kinetics. The precipitation of S equilibrium phases along the grain boundaries decreases and distributes discontinuously, and the precipitate free zone (PFZ) becomes narrower in the alloy containing Zn, which can enhance the exfoliation corrosion resistance and the intergranular corrosion resistance of the alloy. After T8 temper, the strength improves and the plasticity decreases, less S' phase precipitates uniformly at the grain interface. The precipitation of S equilibrium phases along the grain boundaries decreases and the PFZ becomes much narrower, which can improve the intergranular corrosion resisitance and exfoliation corrosion resistance compared with T6 temper.

The results indicate that, the base material presents the highest hardness which decreases within the heat affected zone and heat mechanical affected zone, while in the nugget zone the hardness increases to certain extent. The lowest hardness is found in the heat affected zone. The refined grains observed within the weld nugget attributed to the dynamic recrystallization because the weld nugget experiences both high temperature and stirring rotation deformation. In the nugget, the S′ precipitates and most of the T1 phase dissolve. During nature aging after cooling, the G. P. zone and fine δ′ phase re-pricipitate. In the heat affected zone, S′ phase and partial T1 dissolve. θ′, δ′ and δ′/β′ composites are found in this zone.

84862830804	Effects of Ag addition on the microstructure and thermal stability of 6156 alloy	The effects of Ag addition on the microstructure and thermal stability of 6156 Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloy were investigated by means of hardness measurement, tensile tests, differential scanning calorimetry, and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that addition of small amount of Ag to 6156 alloy did not change the precipitation sequence mainly β″ and Q′ strengthening phase but slightly accelerated the age-hardening rate and increased peak hardness at the same aging condition. The tensile properties enhanced about 30 MPa at the room temperature or thermal exposure at lower temperature (<100 °C). With the exposed temperature and time increased to 150 °C for 1000 h, almost no difference between the Ag-containing and Ag-free alloys. When exposed at 200 °C, the tensile strength of Ag-containing alloy became lower than that of Ag-free alloy because of the coarsening precipitations in matrix and boundary observed by TEM observed. For both alloys, thermal exposure at temperatures 100 °C for long time periods had no significant effect on tensile properties. Loss in strength was small and large with prolonging the exposure time at 150 and 200 °C, respectively. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The orthogonal test results show that the pre-aging has no obvious effect on the mechanical properties and electrical conductivity, and the second step aging temperature and time are the key factors in double aging parameters, which mainly decide the final properties of 6156 alloy. Under the optimum two-step aging treatment of (175°C, 6 h)+(210°C, 5 h), the ultimate strength decreases slightly and the electrical conductivity increases. The mode of corrosion changes from intergranular corrosion to pitting corrosion while the corrosion depth decreases obviously. The TEM observation results show that after two-step aging treatment, there are plenty of Q' precipitates in matrix, and the coarse and isolate precipitates present in grain boundaries and the PFZ is broaden, which contribute to improve the electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance while the tensile strength decreases a little.

The results show that the time to peak aging of 2022 and 2139 alloys during aging at 175°C are 20 h and 15 h, respectively. Both alloys get to the maximal susceptibility of IGC at the peak-aged condition while no obvious IGC behavior but some stable pitting corrosion is found at the over-aged condition. The corrosion resistance of 2022 alloy at the under-aged condition is better than that of 2139 alloy, while under the peak-aged condition, the corrosion resistance of 2022 alloy is obviously the worse, which can be contributed to the type, distribution and morphology of the precipitations.

84865297909	Effect of aging treatments on the mechanical properties and corrosion behavior of 6156 aluminum alloy	The effects of aging treatments on the mechanical properties and corrosion behavior of 6156 A1 alloy were investigated by means of hardness measurement, conventional tensile test, slow strain rate tensile tests (SSRT) and intergranular corrosion test. The microstructures were observed with TEM. The results show that in T6 under-aging (T6UA) condition the precipitates are GP zones with high density in matrix, and no distinct grain boundary precipitates are observed. In T6 peak-aging (T6PA) condition the precipitates are β″ phase with high density and small amount of Q' phase in matrix, the grain boundary precipitates are continuously distributed. The strength of T6 peak-aged 6156 alloy is the highest, however it has the serious tendency to intergranular corrosion and very high sensitivity to stress corrosion crack. With the aging time increasing, Q' phase increases and coarsens, the grain boundary precipitates are coarsened obviously and sparsely distributed, precipitate free zone (PFZ) appears. In T78 conditions, there are plenty of Q' precipitates in matrix, and the coarse and isolate precipitates present in grain boundaries, and the PFZ is broaden. So the corrosion resistance is obviously improved while tensile strength is a little decreased. Copyright © 2012, Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research. Published by Elsevier BV.

The strength of the alloy is almost the same compared with the T6 sample, while the conductivity increases greatly, and the stress corrosion resistance property enhances to the levels of T73 condition. Treated by proper RRA, small amount of η and a great mount of fine and dispersive precipitates η' are observed in the matrix which is similar to that of T6 condition, while the coarse and discontinuous equilibrium precipitates are observed at the grain boundaries which is analogous to that of the T73 condition.

84874537403	Effect of Cu content on microstructures and properties of Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys	The microstructures and properties of Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, Vickers hardness, electrical conductivity, tensile properties test, intergranular corrosion and transmission electron microscopy. The hardness of the alloys aged at 180°C increases to a peak value and decreases subsequently. The hardening rates of the alloys increase with the increase of Cu content, and the softening rate decreases due to overageing. The electrical conductivity of the alloys firstly decreases to a minimum value and increases subsequently. The electrical conductivity decreases with the increase of Cu content. With the Cu content increasing, the tensile strengths of the alloys in T6 and T4 increase, and the resistance to intergranular corrosion decreases, but the alloy without Cu does not present intergranular corrosion sensitivity. The kind of the precipitates in the T6 alloy varies with the Cu content increasing. β″ phase dominates in the alloys at the Cu content lower than 0.6, but β″ and Q' coexist in the alloys with Cu content of 0.9. The number density and volume fraction of the precipitates increase with the increase of Cu content and the size decreases. The precipitates are solute clusters in the T4 alloy.

84876895981	Solute clustering and solute nanostructures in an Al-3.5Cu-0.4Mg-0.2Ge alloy	An Al-3.5Cu-0.4Mg alloy with 0.2 wt.% Ge added exhibited an enhanced age-hardening response as indicated by 50% reduction in peak ageing time and 25% increase in the peak hardness during ageing at 200 C. The clustering and partitioning behaviours of solutes in the alloy during ageing were investigated in detail using atom probe tomography. For the first time, two types of solute clusters, i.e. MgGe-rich clusters and Cu-rich clusters, are found to form in the alloy microalloyed with Ge, and they have different formation kinetics. In the as-quenched state, these small MgGe-rich clusters, rapidly formed in a high number density, did not produce an additional strengthening effect above the strength of an as-quenched Al-3.5Cu-0.4Mg base alloy. They assisted the subsequent formation of fine MgGe-rich needles during ageing. These fine needles serve as a major strengthening component and are responsible for an accelerated age-hardening response of the alloy. By contrast, the later formed Cu-rich clusters assisted the formation of strengthening θ′ precipitates (θ′ platelets and elongated θII′ precipitates) in the alloy. The effective stimulation of forming fine MgGe-rich needles by Ge addition makes the alloy possess a high strength after a prolonged ageing. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84883082452	Microstructures and properties of 2099 Al-Li alloy	In this study, microstructures and properties of 2099 Al-Li alloy were investigated during the thermo-mechanical processing. Treated by two-step homogenization treatment (12 h at 510 C + 36 h at 530 C), the coarse dendritic structures cannot be observed in the alloy. At the same time, the level of grain boundary segregation was lowered, and a few of small AlCuFeMn/AlCuMn particles remained at the grain boundaries. Following homogenization treatment, the alloy was extruded at 470 C. During extrusion process, dynamic recrystallization occurred in the surface layer of alloy, and the depth of dynamic recrystallized layer increased with solution treating at 540 C. The central zone of alloy with solution treatment exhibited {111}<112> and {111}<110> textures, while {112}<110> texture presented at the surface zone. The corresponding central hardness of alloy in central zone was 95 HV, and the surface hardness was 120 HV. After solution treatment, two-step aging treatment was followed. In the peak-aged condition (12 h at 121 C + 48 h at 152 C), a large amount of T1 phases as well as δ′ phases precipitated in the matrix. The tensile strength, yield strength and elongation of alloy on peak aging were 613 MPa, 575 MPa, and 7.9%, respectively.

The two-step aging treatment includes pre-aging at a relatively higher temperature for a shorter time and then re-aging at a lower temperature for a relatively longer time. The microstructural observation shows that after the optimized two-step aging of 180. °C/2. h+160. °C/120. h, the microstructural characteristics of the alloy combines the matrix of high number density β″ precipitates and grain boundaries of discretely distributed GBPs.

With the decrease of W content, the combustion temperature is increased and the combustion reaction mechanism is changed to melt-solution-prepicitation from diffusion-solution-in-solid-state. Preheating mixtures would result in the same effect. As a result, the combustion reaction becomes complete, single-phase (Ti, W)C is synthesized advantageously and the powder size increases with the decrease of W content and the increase of preheat temperature. Meanwhile, the necessary preheat temperature for synthesizing single-phased(Ti, W)C increases with the increase of W content.

84888259285	Effects of aging treatments on tensile properties and fracture toughness of AA6156 aluminum alloy	The tensile properties and plane-stress fracture toughness of AA6156 aluminum alloy with different aging treatments were studied. The results show that the natural aged AA6156 alloy obtains perfect fracture toughness, while a lower strength. The AA6156 alloy in single peak aging at 175°C and in 175°C/6 h+190°C/13 h duplex over aging can both offer preferable strength, while lower fracture toughness. The property of the alloy can achieve the superior combination of the strength and toughness under 175°C/2 h+200°C/0.5 h aging conditions. Microstructure observations indicate that pre-aged treatment can increase the quantity of GP-zones, thus promoting homogeneous precipitation of β″ phase in the following aging treatments. The effect of aging treatments on fracture toughness of AA6156 alloy mainly depends on the strengthening phase β″ in the matrix, whereas grain boundary microstructures have less effect on it.

The results show that the tensile strength of alloy at T8 peak age is 647 MPa. The strengthening phases are a large number of T1 phase, some θ′ phase and small amounts of S'phase, and among them T1 phase plays the main role. After exposing at temperatures below 150°C for 200 h, the density and size of T1 phase don't change obviously and small amounts of secondary precipitation of θ′ can be observed, thus improving the tensile properties slightly. After exposing at 150°C for 500 h, T1 phase coarsens slightly and other tiny T1 phase is precipitated, so the strength decreases by only 5%. When exposing at 200°C and 250°C, T1 phase coarsens remarkably and large equilibrium phase θ is precipitated; as a result, the tensile property decreases rapidly. The tensile strength at elevated temperatures decreases when increasing test temperature. The tensile strength at 200°C is 506 MPa, reaching 87.7% of the strength at room temperature, which is much higher than those of traditional aluminum alloy used at elevated temperature.

84896529181	Fatigue crack initiation and early propagation behavior of 2A97 Al-Li alloy	The fatigue crack initiation and early propagation behavior of 2A97 Al-Li alloy was studied. The smooth specimens were fatigued at room temperature under constant maximum stress control when stress ratio (R) is 0.1 and frequency (f) is 40 Hz. Microstructure observations were examined by optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and electron back scattered diffusion, in order to investigate the relationship between microstructure and fatigue crack initiation and early propagation behavior of 2A97 alloy. The results show that the fatigue cracks are predominantly initiated at inclusions and coarsen secondary phases on the surface of 2A97 alloy. The fatigue crack early propagation behavior of 2A97 alloy is predominantly influenced by the interactions between grain structure and dislocations or persistent slip bands (PSBs). When the misorientation of two neighbouring grains is close to the orientations of the favorable slip plane within these two grains, high-angle grain boundary severely hinders the PSBs passing through, and thus leads to crack bifurcation and deflection. © 2014 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

The thermo-mechanically treated 6061 Al sheets exhibit much higher ultimate tensile strength and yield strength (being 560. MPa and 542. MPa, respectively) than those of the conventional peak-aged sheets (being 365. MPa and 348.

The microstructure analyses show that the high strength is attributed to a combination of precipitation strengthening, dislocation strengthening, sub-structure strengthening and high Taylor factor value and the good ductility is attributed to both the recovery process and the re-precipitation of the GP zones. Furthermore, the contributions of different strengthening mechanisms are quantitatively estimated. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The flow stress increased rapidly to a peak value. The peak stress decreased with increasing deformation temperature and decreasing strain rate. The effects of strain rate and temperature on hot deformation behavior can be represented by a Zener-Hollomon parameter including an Arrhenius term. The influence of the strain has also been incorporated in the constitutive equation and four material constants α, n, A, and the activation energy Q were calculated by compensation of strain. The proposed constitutive equation (considering the compensation of strain) gives an accurate description for the flow stress of the Al-Cu-Li alloy. © ASM International.

The results show that a pronounced texture variation through the plate thickness was found. Near the surface, Goss texture dominated. While in the center of the plate, typical β fiber texture and a scattering of cube texture were observed. And the subsurface layer exhibited a very weak texture. From the center to the subsurface, the fraction of β fiber texture and cube texture decreased. In contrast, the fraction of shear type texture reaching the maximum in subsurface layer increased. The tensile properties in different layers along the thickness direction were inhomogeneous. The strengths near the surface were lower than those in the center. And the through-thickness strength properties variation in the rolling direction was more remarkable than that in the long transverse direction. In the same thickness layer, the fracture toughness and the strengths were anisotropic. The strengths in the rolling direction were higher than those in the long transverse direction and the short transverse direction, and the strengths in the short transverse direction were the lowest.

For the T6 temper, as the aging temperature was elevated from 150°C to 175°C, the aging time period for IGC appearance was shortened. The pre-deformation before aging (T8 temper) also greatly shorten the aging time period for IGC.

SEM observation indicates that AlCuSc ternary phases (W) are formed after homogenization annealing, and cannot be dissolved during the following heat treatments. These coarse particles consume abundant Cu atoms from the Al matrix that are available for solutioning, which results in the decrease of precipitation of the T1 phase during aging treatment. The W phase has negative effects on the examined alloy's mechanical properties. The tensile strength of Sc-added alloy is 40MPa lower than that of the Sc-free alloy. The formation of the W phase has a close relationship with Cu/Sc ratio, which shows the importance of controlling the concentration of Cu and addition of Sc.

The results indicate that due to the strong interaction of Ge with vacancies, the addition of trace Ge inhabits the formation of GP zones, and decreases the density of θ″ and θ′, and it further decreases the aging response rate and reduces the peak-aging hardness and tensile strength of Al-3.5Cu-0.21Ge alloy aged at 175°C. When aged at 200°C, the vacancies diffuse fast and the interaction with Ge is released, and the number of free vacancies increases a lot which resolves the supersaturated solid solution easily.

Their intergranular corrosion (IGC) dependence on aging [T6 type at 423 K (150 °C) and 448 K (175 °C) and T8 type at 423 K (150 °C)] time was studied. An IGC diagram associated with aging process was established. The addition of 0.72 pct Zn enhanced the strength of the Al-Li alloy with T6 type aging at 448 K (175 °C). With aging process, the corrosion mode of the T6-aged Al-Li alloys was changed in the following order: pitting and local IGC (initial aging stage), general IGC (underaging stage), local IGC (near peak-aging stage), and pitting (overaging stage) again. The IGC depth was increased first and then decreased with aging time extension. The corrosion potential change of grains and the microstructure variation were used to explain the IGC sensitivity of the Al-Li alloy with different tempers. Meanwhile, 0.72 pct Zn addition decreased the IGC sensitivity of the Al-Li alloy, especially the T6-aged Al-Li alloy. © 2014 The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.

The results show that the effects of sampling orientation and stress ratio on the crack propagation rates are quite significant in the near-threshold region and the stable-tearing crack growth region, while their effects are relatively small in the stable growth region. The fatigue crack growth rate in L-T orientation is the lowest, followed by the rate in T-L orientation, and the rate in S-L orientation is the largest. The effect of sampling orientation on the fatigue crack growth rate mainly depends on grain orientation, texture orientation and the orientation of second phase particle. The fatigue crack growth rate of stress ratio 0.5 is bigger than that of stress ratio 0.1, which are mainly related to the crack closure effect in the near-threshold region and remarkably influenced by the maximum stress intensity factor K

The effect of aging condition on intergranular corrosion resistance, exfoliation corrosion resistance and microstructure of 1441 aluminum alloy was investigated by means of intergranular corrosion experiments, exfoliation corrosion experiments, polarization curves measurement and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. The results show that, with increasing aging time, the uniform precipitation phase of δ' within the alloy grains in the condition of under aging transforms to the precipitation phases of δ' and S' within the grains, as well as δ and S equilibrium phases along the grain boundaries. The order of corrosion resistance is as: under aging>peak aging>over aging. Compared with T6 aging, after T8 aging, the volumes of δ' and S' phases increase, the size of the phases decreases and distributes uniformly, at the same time the volumes of δ and S phases decrease and PFZ minimizes at grain boundaries, which can increase the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion and exfoliation corrosion. The test of polarization curves in the 3.5%NaCl solution reveals the same conclusion.

Based on the microstructure evolution during the thermo-mechanical treatment, the factors that enhance the tensile properties and intergranular corrosion resistance of the treated sheets are discussed in detail.

84916221549	Effect of high temperature pre-ageing and low-temperature re-ageing on mechanical properties and intergranular corrosion susceptibility of Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys	It is well known that in peak-aged conditions age-hardenable aluminum alloys usually have high strength but low corrosion resistance. Low corrosion resistance of peak-aged Al alloys limits their applications in some corrosive conditions. In order to enhance the corrosion resistance, over-ageing treatments are often carried out but at the expense of strength. Therefore, it is of great industrial value to improve both strength and corrosion resistance of Al alloys simultaneously. In the present work, a novel two-step ageing treatment consisted of high-temperature pre-ageing and low-temperature re-ageing was proposed to improve both the tensile properties and intergranular corrosion (IGC) resistance of Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys simultaneously. Furthermore, the effects of pre-ageing time at 180℃ and re-ageing time at 160℃ on the mechanical property and IGC susceptibility of the 6061 Al alloy were investigated by tensile testing and immersion corrosion testing. It was shown that after the optimized twostep ageing treatment of 180℃, 2 h+160℃, 120 h, the 6061 Al alloy had slightly higher strength than that of the conventional peak-aged samples and no susceptibility to intergranular corrosion. TEM observation revealed that the microstructures of the two-step treated 6061 Al alloy were consisted of high density of β″ phase along with small amount of Q' phase in the matrix and discontinuously distributed, spherical grain boundary precipitates, which led to high strength and IGC resistance of the 6061 Al alloy, respectively. The formation of the characteristic microstructures were attributed to the different decreased level of atomic diffusion rate between the matrix and grain boundary when decreasing from relatively high pre-ageing temperature to low re-ageing temperature, which resulted in the relatively slow growth of the matrix pre-precipitates and rapid coarsening of the grain boundary preprecipitates, simultaneously.

84919948399	Mechanical Property and Intergranular Corrosion Sensitivity of Zn-Free and Zn-Microalloyed Al-2.7Cu-1.7Li-0.3Mg Alloys	The influence of 0.72 pct Zn addition on the tensile properties of Al-2.7Cu-1.7Li-0.3Mg alloys was investigated. Their intergranular corrosion (IGC) dependence on aging [T6 type at 423 K (150 °C) and 448 K (175 °C) and T8 type at 423 K (150 °C)] time was studied. An IGC diagram associated with aging process was established. The addition of 0.72 pct Zn enhanced the strength of the Al-Li alloy with T6 type aging at 448 K (175 °C). With aging process, the corrosion mode of the T6-aged Al-Li alloys was changed in the following order: pitting and local IGC (initial aging stage), general IGC (underaging stage), local IGC (near peak-aging stage), and pitting (overaging stage) again. The IGC depth was increased first and then decreased with aging time extension. The corrosion potential change of grains and the microstructure variation were used to explain the IGC sensitivity of the Al-Li alloy with different tempers. Meanwhile, 0.72 pct Zn addition decreased the IGC sensitivity of the Al-Li alloy, especially the T6-aged Al-Li alloy.

11244333255	Influence of Li on the ageing characteristics and microstructure of Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloy with low Cu/Mg ratio	The influence of lithium on the ageing behavior and microstructure of the low Cu/Mg ratio Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloys was investigated. The results show that the effect of Li is to increase the rate of hardening, however, the addition of lithium does not progressively change age hardening and precipitation process of Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloys with low Cu/Mg ratio, and significant age hardening response only occurs with the addition of 2.0%Li (mass fraction). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) investigation results show that the remarkable increase of age hardness and strength is attributed to the fine dispersion of δ′, Z phase and spherical δ′//β′ compound particles in the 2.0%Li-containing alloy.
