15044347916	Travelling wave differential relay for a series compensated transmission line	Traditional travelling wave differential protection can not be applied to series compensated transmission lines because of the voltage changes on the capacitor. This paper presents an analysis of analyzes the propagation of travelling wave on series compensated lines, especially studies the fault characteristics of the initial wave. The results show that the key travelling wave fault information, the wave front information, is unaffected by the series capacitor bank for metal oxide varistors (MOV) as well as other capacitor types. Based on it, a new differential protection based on the wavelet transform has been proposed. The method uses only the wave front information, so it is suitable for series compensated lines. Electric magnetic transient calculation programming simulations demonstrate the validity of the protection method.

The effects of the liquid metal flow rate, the solid medium mass flow rate, the gas medium mass flow rate and gas pressure on granularity and morphology of the as-prepared stainless steel powders were discussed.

19744378957	Traveling wave differential protection based on wavelet transform	Traveling wave differential protection has high sensitivity, reliability and selectivity. It is immune to the distributed capacitive current, busbar structure, fault resistance, current transformer saturation, etc. Traditional traveling wave differential protection needs to transmit large amount of real-time high-frequency sampling data, which is difficult for current telecommunication methods. When the sampling frequency decrease, the sensitivity and reliability of the protection are compromised. Based on the analysis of the traveling wave with wavelet transform, this paper presents a method of traveling wave differential protection based on the wavelet transform. The proposed method utilizes only the key information of the fault traveling wave, i.e. the wavefronts information, thus the communication burden is reduced, and the sensitivity and reliability of the protection are improved. Analysis and simulation results show that the new method has high speed, sensitivity and reliability, and can be employed as the primary protection of EHV/UHV transmission line.

19044362062	Distributed capacitive current compensation algorithm for current differential relay of UHV transmission line	This paper investigates the mechanism of distributed capacitive current by using the traveling wave theory and presents a novel distributed capacitive current time-domain compensation algorithm based on current traveling wave. The proposed algorithm has the same compensation effect for the capacitive current under both transient and stable operating condition and needs not to increase the sample frequency or the telecommunication traffic. While the protected line is subject to no internal fault or a midpoint fault, the algorithm can fully compensate the distributed capacitive current. When a fault occurs at other points of the protected line, the proposed algorithm produces the approximately same ratio of the operating current to restraining current so as to fully compensate the capacitive current. The algorithm can effectively eliminate the adverse influence of distributed capacitive current on the current differential relay. EMTP simulation results demonstrate the validity of the novel algorithm.

19944433072	Traveling wave differential protection on UHV transmission line with shunt reactor	Because of the current on the shunt reactor, traditional traveling wave differential protection cannot be applied to transmission line with shunt reactor. To solve this problem, this paper studies the application of traveling wave differential protection based on wavelet transform on this type of lines. The propagation of traveling wave on transmission line with shunt reactor and the effects of the reactor on the calculation of wavefronts are analyzed. The results show that the reactor has no influence on the magnitude of wavefronts, and causes only tiny calculation error. Hence the traveling wave differential protection based on wavelet transform can be applied on the transmission line with shunt reactor. EMTP simulations prove the arguments.

27144449675	Fast detector of symmetrical fault during power swing for distance relay	Distance relay should be blocked during power swing to ensure the reliability, but still should trip as soon as possible after an internal fault occurs during power swing. It was very difficult to detect the symmetrical fault reliably and fast during power swing with complex power swing conditions and fault conditions considered. This paper presents a new fast detector of symmetrical fault during power swing. Based on the sudden reduction of absolute value of the change rate of power swing centre voltage (PSCV), the presented detector can detect the symmetrical fault reliably and sensitively in two cycles. This detector is easy to set and immune to the swing period, fault arc, fault location and power angle. EMTP simulations and Real-Time Digital Simulator system (RTDS) tests prove the presented detector is fast, sensible and reliable. © 2005 IEEE.

The model predicts that the bulk solvent provides an important contribution to CMPC and influences the redox properties of MPCs.

33751369329	Study on the voltage traveling wave wavefront detection for CVT	Voltage traveling wave wavefronts are essential for the traveling-wave based relays. Capacitive Voltage Transformers (CVTs) are the predominant source of the voltage signals for the relays in HV/EHV/UHV power systems. To study the influence of the CVT on the detection of the voltage traveling wavefronts, this paper firstly analyzes the frequency response, especially the high frequency response of the CVT with the transfer function. The contributing factors to the high frequency response of the CVT are deeply studied. Then the companion model of the CVT is modeled and the wavelet transform is utilized to simulate and analyze the influence of the CVT on the voltage traveling wavefrtons. The study results show that the CVT causes severe attenuation and phase shift for the high frequency components, consequently it seriously suppresses and disturbs the voltage traveling wavefronts. Adjusting the parameters of the CVT can improve the wavefronts in the CVT's output, but serious errors are still inevitable. Further study is needed to recover and detect the wavefronts precisely from the CVT's output. © 2005 IEEE.

Comparing with the boundary dual boost bridgeless rectifier, the required number of power components is reduced by one third and two current transducers can be eliminated. The zero-current detection is achieved by sampling the diode current through a single current transducer. Besides, a soft-transition method is proposed to suppress the current spike at the line-voltage zero-crossing point. Furthermore, a ZVS range extension operation is proposed to achieve ZVS in the MOSFETs within the full range of line input, which needs no additional MOSFETs. This also makes it possible to reduce MOSFET turn-OFF losses by paralleling external capacitors. Hence, a high-efficiency and low common-mode noise-interference bridgeless rectifier is achieved. This rectifier is also a candidate for interleaving operation to upgrade the power level. The experimental results show that ZVS is achieved within the full range of universal line input. The efficiency is above 96% at full load under 90 V and the maximum efficiency is above 98.4%. The ZVS range extension operation improves the efficiency by 0.5%. © 2006 IEEE.

The effects of deformation variables on the as-compressed microstructures and the deformation behavior were analyzed. Grain splitting that developed in various directions due to the formation of microbands was the main characteristic of microstructural evolution during hot multi-directional compression, which was different from that of the continuous uniaxial compression. Such microbands intersected each other, resulting in continuous subdivision of the coarse grains into misoriented fine domains, thus contributing to grain refinement. Further deformation led to increases in the number and misorientation of these boundaries and finally almost full development of fine equiaxed grains at high strain. A more homogeneous microstructure with fine dynamic recrystallization grains could be attained with the applied strain up to a critical strain, and after that, it was difficult to achieve further grain refinement. However, the higher reduction in each pass and the lower deformation temperature in the certain range aided grain refinement. The second phase Mg

The dissolution of pearlite and the transformation of ferrite into austenite were simulated. The calculation domain was divided into square cells, which are characterized by certain attributes that represent the status of each cell: pearlite (P), ferrite (α), austenite (γ) or γ /α interface. The dissolution of pearlite was described by nucleation and growth of austenite. A mixed-mode model in multicomponent system was employed to calculate the growth velocity of the γ /α interface. According to Burke and Turnbull's theory, austenite grain coarsening induced by γ /γ grain boundary migration was simulated. To validate the model, dilatometric and quenching experiments were carried out. The dilatometric experiment was conducted using a Gleeble1500D with a sample 8 mm in diameter. The temperature of the sample was measured using thermocouples welded on the sample surface. In the quenching experiments, steel samples were heated to different temperatures then dropped into a water tank immediately, and the microstructure of the samples was examined to determine the fraction of the austenite.

The operation principle of the very converter is simply analyzed. Digital design consideration based on the small-signal dynamic modeling of the isolated PFC converter is specified in this paper. Implementation strategy and cost effectiveness of digital control for the single-stage PFC converter are studied. A transformer is used to provide galvanic isolation enables a wide range of output voltages, either lower or higher than the input voltage, allowing multi-output solutions. The adopted digital control strategy features fast dynamic response and excellent steady regulation characteristic without multiplying the input feedforward. High power factor and high efficiency are both achieved by combining FB main circuit and digital control. That flexibility is greatly increased can further contribute to system integration research on distributed power system[1]. Without multiplying the input feedforward, fast dynamic can be achieved due to the flexibility of digital control strategy.

The anion-dependent oxidative charging of MPC films was observed in imidazolium based ILs, which is similar to that of anion-rectified/limited oxidative charging previously observed in aqueous media. The absence of reductive charging in imidazolium ILs is simply because of the inadequate hydrophobicity of the imidazolium cation. Replacing the imidazolium cation with more hydrophobic tetrahexylammonium, the reductive charging of MPC films was observed. The ionic dependence manifests the charging process to be an ion-coupled electron transfer event, with the oxidative/reductive charging of MPCs at the electrode/film interface concomitant with the ionic partition at the film/IL interface. This system provides a diverse possibility of regulating the electronic properties of nanoparticle thin films by ionic/solvent functions, given that ILs are "designed solvents" with structures and functions easily tuned by ionic components (both anion and cation). © 2010 American Chemical Society.

As compared with the autogenous welding process, the welding process with filler strip brought about a decrease in the fusion zone (FZ) area and a reduction in grain growth in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). A significant grain refinement in the FZ was achieved by the addition of the filler metal containing Mn, and the equiaxed grains with the average size of about 6.0m were obtained. The joints welded with filler metal exhibited improved tensile properties compared to those welded autogenously, and the highest joint efficiency was obtained with the addition of the AZ31 +1.5wt% Mn filler strip, which was up to 99%.

79955913841	7,7′,8,8′-Tetracyanoquinodimethane as a redox probe for studying cation transfer across the water/2-nitrophenyl octyl ether interface at three-phase junctions supported by carbon ink screen-printed electrodes	The transfer of alkylammonium cations across the water/2-nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE) interface was studied at the three-phase junctions supported by a carbon ink screen-printed electrode (SPE) using cyclic and square-wave voltammetry. A microliter droplet of NPOE containing 7,7′,8,8′- tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) was immobilized on the surface of the SPE and was immersed in aqueous solutions containing various alkylammonium salts. A plot of the half-wave transfer potential versus the logarithm of the cation concentration exhibits a close to Nernst slope. Moreover, a plot of the half-wave transfer potentials against the formal transfer potentials of alkylammonium cations yielded a slope close to unity. All these experimental facts suggest that the reduction of TCNQ at the SPE/NPOE interface is accompanied by a simultaneous cation transfer across the NPOE/water interface to preserve the electroneutrality of the organic microdroplet, namely the overall process corresponds to a cation-coupled electron transfer reaction. Finally, this approach allowed measuring the formal transfer potential of highly lipophilic cation, such as bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene) ammonium. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

79958133714	Discrete reductive charging of immobilized gold nanoclusters in aqueous media	Multilayer films consisting of monolayer-protected gold nanoclusters (MPCs) coated on electrode surfaces and immersed in aqueous media were investigated to elucidate the suppression of the reductive charging. On the use of water-soluble electrolytes featuring a lipophilic cation, discrete reductive charging of MPC films was unambiguously observed. It was proved to be tightly concomitant with the cation transfer at the film/solution interface by the cation concentration dependence and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements. From this study, it was rationalized that the inadequate lipophilic cations used in previous works accounted for the suppression of reductive charging current. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79961015834	Friction and wear properties of particle reinforced graded aluminum matrix composites	The Al-17Si functionally graded material (FGM) with SiC volume fraction of 0-30% continuously were synthesized using new spray deposition technique. Furthermore, the microstructure, hardness and wear ability of this functionally graded material were studied with SEM, MHV-2000 Hervey hardness tester and MG-2000 pin-on-disc friction and wear testing machine. The results show that the friction coefficient decreases with increasing the applied load and sliding speed. The wear rate rises with the increase of applied load and it reaches the maximum at speed of 500r/min firstly, and then falls with increasing the sliding speed. Because of the existence of defects, such as the hole, the mainly wear way of the deposition is abrasive and delamination, while the composites after hot pressing is mainly abrasive and adhesive. The hardness and wear resistance of every part of materials increase with increasing the SiC content in the deposition billet.

79960746478	Ion transfer coupled discrete charging of immobilised gold nanoclusters in polar organic solvents	We herein investigated the counterion-dependent redox charging properties of gold nanocluster films in polar organic solvents. They were found to be in between those demonstrated in polar aqueous and weakly polar/nonpolar organic media, typically characteristic of a significant voltage separation between the first oxidation and reduction dependent on the lipophilicity of electrolyte counterions. The overall process was proposed to be an ion transfer coupled electron transfer reaction, which was thermodynamically limited by the counterion migration at the film/solution interface and kinetically by the diffusion-like electron hopping among MPCs within the film. These data are helpful in understanding why in previous works the counterion-dependent redox charging is evident only in highly polar aqueous media but not in weakly polar or nonpolar organic solvents. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The results reveal that the SiCP weight fraction of the as-deposited preform from the top to the bottom ranges almost continuously from 0 to 30%. The part with the higher SiCP weight fraction exhibits a relatively smaller density than that with the lower SiCP weight fraction. However, the microhardness and the porosity increase with the increasing SiCP weight fraction in the as-deposited preform.

82755196315	Effect of pre-treatment on the microstructural homogeneity and mechanical properties of magnesium alloy sheets produced by high strain rate rolling	Magnesium sheets prepared by traditional plastic processing technologies always exhibit undesirable mechanical properties, which is inefficient and costly for commercial application. High strain rate rolling (HSRR) was operated on AZ31 magnesium alloy. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the HSRRed sheets pre-treated in two different ways were investigated. The results indicated that HSRR was an effective method to produce magnesium alloy sheets characteristic of fine grains and high comprehensive mechanical properties. The pre-strain plus homogenization pre-treatment could significantly improve the microstructural homogeneity of the high strain rate rolled sheet, in which the fine grains were distributed very homogeneously and the average grain size was 2.3μm. The ductility of the sheet was enhanced due to the improved microstructural homogeneity, and the elongation at room temperature was up to 28%.

84855555772	Microstructure and mechanical properties of spray deposition Al/SiC p composite after hot extrusion	Investigations of composite based on a spray deposition Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy reinforced with SiC particles with the volume fraction of 15% and various extrusion ratios of 11-39 are presented. Bars with a diameter of 8-15 mm were obtained as the end product. Based on the microstructural examinations of the composite, we can find that SiC particles adhered mainly to the surface of the alloy droplets during deposition, leading to more SiC particles at the surface of the droplets and less in the inner. Thus, the distribution of SiC particles in the billet was characteristic of the layered feature. This layered feature of SiC particles was not completely removed by the following hot extrusion. The SiC particles were distributed like the streamline in the longitudinal direction. A higher extrusion ratio resulted in an more uniform distribution of SiC particles. Ambient tensile tests made it possible to demonstrate that the mechanical properties improve with the increasing of extrusion ratio. The ultimate tensile strength and elongation achieve 475 MPa and 16.5% at an extrusion ratio of 39. © 2011 ASM International.

In the model, the thermodynamics and solute diffusion of the multicomponent system were taken into account by using Thermo-Calc and Dictra software.

It was shown that the simulated results are in good agreement with the experimental results. As the cooling rate increases, proeutectoid α-ferrite content increased, while the mean grain size of proeutectoid α-ferrite and the average lamellar spacing of pearlite decreased. © Copyright.

All the sheets have ultrafine-grained structures and exhibit excellent strength and ductility. Extensive deformation twinning, production of high-density dislocations in twins, subsequent continuous dynamic recrystallization (DRX) and discontinuous DRX contribute to the feasibility of HSRR and to the ultrafine-grained structures. The excellent mechanical properties are ascribed to the ultrafine grains, low dislocation density and weakened basal texture in the final structure. © 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

Two slow diodes are used as rectifier diodes and voltage clamping diodes at the same time. As a result, nature voltage clamp is achieved. Furthermore, the proposed converter has high device utilisation factor and requires only one inductor, which simplifies the whole circuit.

84865444349	Microstructure and mechanical properties of ZK21 magnesium alloy fabricated by multiple forging at different strain rates	Multiple forging (MF) was carried out on as-cast ZK21 magnesium alloy to an accumulated strain of ∑Δε=2.64 at different strain rates. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the MFed samples were investigated. The initial grains should be significantly refined after MF due to dynamic recrystallization (DRX), including twin induced DRX (TDRX) at initial grain core and rotation DRX (RDRX) at initial grain boundaries. However, the microstructure and properties of the samples MFed at different strain rates were significantly different owing to the strain rate sensitivity of twinning and DRX. In low strain rate MFed (LSRMF) samples, it was difficult to obtain a complete DRX microstructure due to low twin density, which resulted in a limited improvement in mechanical properties. However, the high strain rate MFed (HSRMF) samples formed an island-like ultrafine DRX structure at grain cores with average grain size of ~0.3 μm owing to higher twin density, while honeycomb-like coarse DRX grains also formed at initial grain boundaries due to an adiabatic temperature raise. This novel mixed structure of honeycomb-like coarse DRX grains and island-like ultrafine DRX grains in HSRMFed sample showed substantial improvements in mechanical properties. Mechanical testing gave an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 341. MPa and an elongation of 25% at ∑Δε=2.64, HSRMF has therefore identified as a potential technique for producing stronger and more ductile wrought ZK21 alloy. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84867235304	Effects of minor Ca addition on microstructure and mechanical properties of the Mg-4.5Zn-4.5Sn-2Al-based alloy system	Effects of minor Ca addition (0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mass%) on microstructure and mechanical properties of the as-cast and the as-rolled Mg-4.5Zn-4.5Sn-2Al- based alloy system are investigated by OM, XRD, SEM and mechanical testing. The alloy castings are produced by water-cooling copper casting under pressure. Minor Ca addition can effectively refine both grains and grain-boundary compounds and this effect is more obvious with a higher Ca addition. However, a larger amount of grain-boundary compounds are detected with a higher Ca addition, resulting in the inferior roll forming ability. The as-cast alloy with 0.2% Ca addition exhibits a fairly good roll forming ability and the optimal combined mechanical properties, with the ultimate tensile strength and elongation of 243 MPa and 13.9%, respectively. The 0.2% Ca addition plays important roles in refining twins and DRX grains, increasing twinning density and promoting precipitations in the as-rolled alloy, contributing to the enhanced strength. The as-rolled Mg-4.5Zn-4.5Sn-2Al-0.2Ca alloy exhibits the ultimate tensile strength of 406 MPa and the yield strength of 285 MPa, about 18% and 26% higher than the Ca-free alloy. However, the 0.2% Ca addition reduces the plasticity of the as-rolled alloy.© 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that there exist uniform dispersedly strengthening phase η' in three kinds of alloys with T6 treatment(ageing 120°C at 24 h), where precipitation strengthening plays a dominant role. With the increase of Zn, Mg content, the amount of precipitated phases is increased gradually, resulting in simultaneous enhancement of precipitation strengthening effect. The tensile strength of the three alloys reaches 646.2 MPa, 697.4 MPa, 732.5 MPa, respectively, corresponding to its precipitation strengthening effect, and the elongation is 13.0%, 10.6%, 7.1%, respectively. Al-8.2Zn-2.05Mg-2.2Cu-0.1Mn-0.25Zr alloy can obtain subgrains structure by using thermo-mechanical treatment including pre-ageing at 120°C for 12 h +30% warm deformation at 120°C + final-ageing at 120°C for 10 h, where the strengthening mechanisms of the alloy is characterized by co-action of subgrains strengthening and precipitation strengthening, and tensile strength and elongation reach up to 752.3 MPa and 6.7%, respectively. Subgrains with uniform dispersedly strengthening phases distributing inside are more favorable to the properties of alloy than increasing number of precipitated phases only.

84878247250	Enhancing the visualization of latent fingerprints by electrochemiluminescence of rubrene	We report how electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of rubrene can be utilized for enhancing the visualization of latent fingerprints in two different modes. The enhancement arises from the spatially selective ECL generation either from the substrate surface uncovered by the fingerprint or the fingerprint itself, designated negative or positive imaging mode, respectively. The negative mode is performed directly in an electrolyte solution containing rubrene and co-reactant. Given that organic residues in the fingerprint deposit make the underlying surface electrochemically inert or less active, ECL reaction occurs only on the surface untouched by the fingertip, generating a negative impression with a dark ridge pattern against the illuminated background. The positive imaging mode is based on the preferential adsorption of rubrene aggregates to the ridge materials via physical attraction; then the fingerprint can glow via ECL reaction in a solution containing co-reactant under an appropriate applied potential. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The characteristics of powders prepared by common gas atomization and dual-phase flow atomization under similar conditions were compared. The experimental results show that the dual-phase flow-atomized powders have average particle sizes that are one-half that of the common gas-atomized particles; additionally, they possess a finer microstructure and higher cooling rate under the same atomization gas pressure and the same gas flow. The Weber number in the crash criteria of liquid atomization is adopted to measure the crash ability of the atomization media. The Weber number of the dual-phase flow atomization medium is the sum of that of the gas and the solid particles. Furthermore, the critical equation of the crash model in dual-phase flow atomization is established, and the main regularities associated with this process were analyzed. © 2014 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

The effects of rotational speed and load on the wear and friction behaviors of the SiCp/Al-20Si-3Cu FGM sliding against the resin matrix friction material were investigated. For comparison, the wear and friction behaviors of a commercially used cast iron (HT250) brake rotor were also studied. The results indicate that the friction coefficient of the SiCp/Al-20Si-3Cu FGM decreases constantly with the increase of load or rotational speed and is affected by the gradient distribution of SiC particles. The wear rate of the SiCp/Al-20Si-3Cu FGM firstly increases, then decreases and finally increases again with increasing load or speed, and is about 1/10 of that of HT250. Based on observations and analyses on the morphology and substructure of the worn surface, the mechanical mixing layer acts as a protective coating and lubricant, and its thickness reduces with the SiC content increasing. Furthermore, it is proposed that the dominant wear mechanism of SiCp/Al-20Si-3Cu FGM changes from the abrasive wear to the oxidative wear and further to the delamination wear with increasing load or speed. © ASM International.

The mesochannel has a uniform pore size of 2-3 nm in diameter and a positively charged surface due to grafted ammonium groups. The electrostatic and steric effects resulted from control of the surface charge and the ionic buffer concentration make the SMCs permselective, favoring the mass transport of oppositely charged species and repelling that of similarly charged ones. By using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), the SMCs with this charge selectivity can be employed for permselective detection of ascorbic acid (AA) and dopamine (DA) that are oppositely charged compounds. The obtained linear detection range was 49-2651 μM for AA and 20-226 μM for DA, respectively. AA and DA in real samples were also determined by the SMC film modified electrode.

In this paper, we reported a novel ECL imaging biosensor array modified with an enzyme/carbon nanotubes/chitosan composite film for the determination of glucose, choline and lactate. The biosensor array was constructed by integrating a patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass plate with six perforated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) covers. ECL is generated by the electrochemical reaction between luminol and hydrogen peroxide that is produced by the enzyme catalysed oxidation of different substrates with molecular oxygen, and ECL images were captured by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The separated electrochemical micro-cells enabled simultaneous assay of six samples at different concentrations. From the established calibration curves, the detection limits were 14 μM for glucose, 40 μM for lactate and 97 μM for choline, respectively. Moreover, multicomponent assays and cross reactivity were also studied, both of which were satisfied for the analysis. This biosensing platform based on ECL imaging shows many distinct advantages, including miniaturization, low cost, and multi-functionalization.

84907462334	Nonactive power loss minimization in a bidirectional isolated DC-DC converter for distributed power systems	Originated from analyzing nonactive power loss, a novel optimization method and modulation solution for bidirectional isolated dual-active-bridge (DAB) dc-dc converters are proposed in order to achieve high efficiency in a wide operating range. A comprehensive nonactive power loss model is developed, including both the nonactive components delivered back to the source and from the load. This paper points out that when the minimum nonactive power loss is achieved, zero-voltage soft switching can be naturally fulfilled. The optimal phase-shift pair obtained by the proposed method can keep low values of both root mean square (RMS) current and circulating power. Rather than using ideal power flow analysis, the nonactive power loss model directly embodies practical nonideal factors, including device voltage drops. Based on the analysis, an extended dual phase shift is proposed, and different operation cases are analyzed with comparison of performance indices. Experimental tests verify the theoretical analysis and show effectiveness of the proposed approach to achieve nonactive power loss minimization and efficiency improvement.

In this approach, antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were used to specifically interact with the corresponding antigens in the fingerprint residue. The AuNPs serve as the nucleation sites for autometallographic deposition of silver particles from the silver staining solution, generating a dark ridge pattern for visual detection. Using fingerprints inked with human immunoglobulin G (hIgG), we obtained the optimal formulation of iMMD, which was then successfully applied to visualize sweat fingerprints through the detection of two secreted polypeptides, epidermal growth factor and lysozyme. In comparison with the conventional MMD, iMMD is faster and can provide additional information than just identification. Moreover, iMMD is facile and does not need expensive instruments.
