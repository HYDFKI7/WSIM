Safety evaluation of China's maritime transport key nodes Safety evaluation of maritime transport key nodes is an important part of protecting China's maritime transport passage. In order to play a scientific and comprehensive safety evaluation of the key nodes of China's maritime transport, an index system is established, and the projection pursuit model and genetic algorithm are applied to evaluate the security of key nodes. Furthermore, the main security threats of the related straits are excavated. The evaluation results indicate that: the security situation of the Strait of Hormuz, Malacca, Peter and the Suez Canal is relatively poor, which have a very important impact on China's maritime transportation of oil, container and other important materials; in addition, the Lombok Strait, the Sunda Strait and the Makassar Strait also have relatively low level of security, which are all in Indonesia. The evaluation results provide scientific basis for China to develop measures to protect the safety of maritime transport and make related management decisions, and have great significance to improve China's maritime transport security and reliability.
