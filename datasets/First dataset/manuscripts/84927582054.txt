Identification and elimination of metabolic bottlenecks in the quinone modification pathway for enhanced coenzyme Q<inf>10</inf> production in Rhodobacter sphaeroides In this report, UbiE and UbiH in the quinone modification pathway (QMP) were identified in addition to UbiG as bottleneck enzymes in the CoQ<inf>10</inf> biosynthesis by Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The CoQ<inf>10</inf> content was enhanced after co-overexpression of UbiE and UbiG, however, accompanied by the accumulation of the intermediate 10P-MMBQ. UbiH was then co-overexpressed to pull the metabolic flux towards downstream, resulting in an elevated CoQ<inf>10</inf> productivity and decreased biomass. On the other hand, the expression levels of UbiE and UbiG were tuned to eliminate the intermediate accumulation, however at the sacrifice of productivity. To alleviate the detrimental effect on either productivity or cell growth, we tried to fuse UbiG with UbiE and localize them onto the membrane to elevate intermediate conversion. By fusing UbiE and UbiG to pufX, CoQ<inf>10</inf> was accumulated to 108.51±2.76mg/L with a biomass of 12.2±0.9g/L. At last, we combined the optimized QMP and the previously engineered 2-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway (MEP) to further boost CoQ<inf>10</inf> biosynthesis, resulting in a strain with 138±2.64mg/L CoQ<inf>10</inf> production.
