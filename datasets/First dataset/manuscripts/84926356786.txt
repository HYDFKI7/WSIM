Prokaryotic expression and purification of truncated protein F<inf>212-489</inf> of respiratory syncytial virus Objective To construct the truncated F1 protein (F212489) of human respiratory syncytial viras (RSV) in prokaryotic cells and purify the expressed product. Methods The f<inf>212-489</inf> gene was amplified from plasmid pMD-18T-f by PCR and identified by TA cloning, then inserted into prokaryotic expression vector pET-28a. The constructed recombinat plasmid pET-28a-f<inf>212-489</inf> was transformed to E. coli BL21 (DE3) for expression under induction of IPTG. The expressed recombinant protein was purified by nickel ion affinity chromatography and identified by Western blot. Results Restriction analysis showed that recombinant plasmid pET-28a-f<inf>212-489</inf> was constructed correctly. The expressed recombinant protein, with a relative molecualr mass of about 30 000, mainly existed in a form of inclusion body, and contained about 10% of total somatic protein. The purified recombinant protein reached a purity of 85%, and showed specific binding to goat anti-RSV polyclonal antibody. Conclusion The protein F<inf>212-489</inf> of RSV was expressed successfully and showed good reactogenicity after purification, which laid a foundation of study on the immune mechanism of RSV and preparation of subunit or polypeptide vaccine by gene engineering technique.
