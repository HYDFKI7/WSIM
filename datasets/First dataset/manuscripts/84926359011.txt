Non-uniform axial force precise modeling and simulation of recycled aggregate concrete confined by steel tube column According to the complexity of non-uniform axial force on recycled aggregate concrete confined by steel tube column, precise modeling and simulation on non-uniform axial force were put forward, mechanic properties of axial force under uniform and non-uniform conditions were analyzed, and its three-dimensional model and force model were established. Then impact of load capacity was analyzed, such as geometric diameter, loading condition, and deformation during production. Force simulation and experimental results fit relatively well. It turned out that uniform axial load capacity was greater than concentrated eccentric axial load capacity. Besides, eccentric axial load capacity was related to eccentricity. Moreover, it could be singled out that non-uniform axial load capacity was greater than concentrated eccentric axial load capacity. The research demonstrates that variation in parameter selection, different force conditions have relatively high influence on load capacity of components. The results verify the validity of calculation approach and model.
