Dose-dependent effects of selenite (Se4+) on arsenite (As3+)-induced apoptosis and differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells To enhance the therapeutic effects and decrease the adverse effects of arsenic on the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, we investigated the co-effects of selenite (Se4+) and arsenite (As3+) on the apoptosis and differentiation of NB4 cells and primary APL cells. A 1.0-μM concentration of Se4+ prevented the cells from undergoing As3+-induced apoptosis by inhibiting As3+ uptake, eliminating As3+-generated reactive oxygen species, and repressing the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway. However, 4.0 μM Se4+ exerted synergistic effects with As3+ on cell apoptosis by promoting As3+ uptake, downregulating nuclear factor-κB, and activating caspase-3. In addition to apoptosis, 1.0 and 3.2 μM Se4+ showed contrasting effects on As3+-induced differentiation in NB4 cells and primary APL cells. The 3.2 μM Se4+ enhanced As3+-induced differentiation by promoting the degradation of promyelocytic leukemia protein-retinoic acid receptor-α (PML-RARα) oncoprotein, but 1.0 μM Se4+ did not have this effect. Based on mechanistic studies, Se4+, which is similar to As3+, might bind directly to Zn2+-binding sites of the PML RING domain, thus controlling the fate of PML-RARα oncoprotein.
