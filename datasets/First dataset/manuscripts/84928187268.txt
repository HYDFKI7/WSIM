Fabrication and characterisation of lead zirconate titanate thin films for microactuators Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films have played an important role in the performance of microactuators. A description is provided of the effects of different heat treatment processes on the orientation and microstructures of PZT thin films deposited by the chemical solution deposition method. X-ray diffractometry and field-emission scanning electron microscopy were used to characterise the orientation and microstructures of the thin films. It was found that the intensity of the (100) peak weakens along with the increase of the pyrolytic layer thickness before 600°C annealing. Thin pyrolytic layers obtained highly (100)-oriented structures with distinct grain boundaries after 600° C annealing heat treatment. For comparison, membrane structures were fabricated to test the performance of PZT thin films with different orientations and different microstructures. The results show that highly (100)-oriented PZT thin film yields higher deformation and shows better dielectric properties.
