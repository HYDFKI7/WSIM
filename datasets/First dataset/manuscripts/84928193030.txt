Recombination of strain O segments to HCpro-encoding sequence of strain N of Potato virus Y modulates necrosis induced in tobacco and in potatoes carrying resistance genes Ny or Nc Hypersensitive resistance (HR) to strains O and C of Potato virus Y (PVY, genus Potyvirus) is conferred by potato genes Ny<inf>tbr</inf> and Nc<inf>tbr</inf>, respectively; however, PVY N strains overcome these resistance genes. The viral helper component proteinases (HCpro, 456 amino acids) from PVY<sup>N</sup> and PVY<sup>O</sup> are distinguished by an eight-amino-acid signature sequence, causing HCpro to fold into alternative conformations. Substitution of only two residues (K269R and R270K) of the eight-amino-acid signature in PVY<sup>N</sup> HCpro was needed to convert the three-dimensional (3D) model of PVY<sup>N</sup> HCpro to a PVY<sup>O</sup>-like conformation and render PVY<sup>N</sup> avirulent in the presence of Ny<inf>tbr</inf>, whereas four amino acid substitutions were necessary to change PVY<sup>O</sup> HCpro to a PVY<sup>N</sup>-like conformation. Hence, the HCpro conformation rather than other features ascribed to the sequence were essential for recognition by Ny<inf>tbr</inf>. The 3D model of PVY<sup>C</sup> HCpro closely resembled PVY<sup>O</sup>, but differed from PVY<sup>N</sup> HCpro. HCpro of all strains was structurally similar to Î²-catenin. Sixteen PVY<sup>N</sup>605-based chimeras were inoculated to potato cv. Pentland Crown (Ny<inf>tbr</inf>), King Edward (Nc<inf>tbr</inf>) and Pentland Ivory (Ny<inf>tbr</inf>/Nc<inf>tbr</inf>). Eleven chimeras induced necrotic local lesions and caused no systemic infection, and thus differed from both parental viruses that infected King Edward systemically, and from PVY<sup>N</sup>605 that infected Pentland Crown and Pentland Ivory systemically. These 11 chimeras triggered both Ny<inf>tbr</inf> and Nc<inf>tbr</inf> and, in addition, six induced veinal necrosis in tobacco. Further, specific amino acid residues were found to have an additive impact on necrosis. These results shed new light on the causes of PVY-related necrotic symptoms in potato.
