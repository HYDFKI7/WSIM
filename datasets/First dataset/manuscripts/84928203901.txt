Activation of a Primed RING E3-E2-Ubiquitin Complex by Non-Covalent Ubiquitin RING ubiquitin ligases (E3) recruit ubiquitin-conjugate enzymes (E2) charged with ubiquitin (Ub) to catalyze ubiquitination. Non-covalent Ub binding to the backside of certain E2s promotes processive polyUb formation, but the mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that backside bound Ub (Ub<sup>B</sup>) enhances both RING-independent and RING-dependent UbcH5B-catalyzed donor Ub (Ub<sup>D</sup>) transfer, but with a more prominent effect in RING-dependent transfer. Ub<sup>B</sup> enhances RING E3s' affinities for UbcH5B-Ub, and RING E3-UbcH5B-Ub complex improves Ub<sup>B</sup>'s affinity for UbcH5B. A comparison of the crystal structures of a RING E3, RNF38, bound to UbcH5B-Ub in the absence and presence of Ub<sup>B</sup>, together with molecular dynamics simulation and biochemical analyses, suggests Ub<sup>B</sup> restricts the flexibility of UbcH5B's α1 and α1β1 loop. Ub<sup>B</sup> supports E3 function by stabilizing the RING E3-UbcH5B-Ub complex, thereby improving the catalytic efficiency of Ub transfer. Thus, Ub<sup>B</sup> serves as an allosteric activator of RING E3-mediated Ub transfer.
