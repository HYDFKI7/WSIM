Research on motion control technology of virtual human's lower limb based on optical motion capture data As passive-optical motion capture equipment could only capture the motion information of human's key joints, a simplified skeleton structure model of virtual human was introduced; and then the error sources of motion data of virtual human were analyzed according to the acquisition process of optical motion capture data based on the skeleton structure model. Focusing on the problem of poor continuity of motion process of virtual human's lower limb caused by continuity deficiency of motion capture data, a motion control method was proposed to strengthen the control of motion process of virtual human, which included data smoothing of motion process of key joints and the calculation of motion information of other joints in the lower limb kinematic chain based on inverse kinematics. An experiment and a virtual maintenance training platform of a transfer case have proved the validity and practicability of the proposed method.
