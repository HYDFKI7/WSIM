Determination of trifolirhizin in rat plasma by UPLC: Application to a pharmacokinetic study In this study, a simple, sensitive, and robust analytical method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) has been developed for the determination of trifolirhizin in rat plasma using pirfenidone as internal standard (IS). After sample preparation by a simple liquid-liquid extraction, chromatography was performed on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1. mm. ×. 50. mm, 1.7. μm particle size) and ultraviolet detection set at a wavelength of 366. nm. The method was linear over the concentration range 25-1000. ng/mL with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 25. ng/mL. Inter- and intra-day precision (RSD%) were all within 10.2% and the accuracy (RE%) was equal or lower than 9.3%. The recovery was in the range of 78.5-86.4% for trifolirhizin and 87.4% for IS. Stability studies showed that trifolirhizin was stable under a variety of storage conditions. The method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study involving oral administration of trifolirhizin to rats.
