Color demosaicking method based on regular hexagon CFA pattern and compressive sensing In the color imaging system based on Bayer color filter array (CFA), demosaicking is a key process to high quality full-color images. Traditional demosaicking methods for quadrilateral color filter array usually suffer from some artifacts, such as zipper effects and false colors. Medical researches show that hexagonal sampling approach is more in line with the visual characteristics of the human eye. In this paper, we try to apply hexagonal color filter array and sparse characteristics in the images in color imaging system, and present a new demosaicking method based on compressive sensing (CS). Our method fully exploits the sparse characteristics between and within three color components by using the color image theory and the RGB spectral characteristics, and thus can enhance the fidelity of reconstructed image, such as good texture details and color reproduction. In particular, our method can avoid the aliasing phenomenon, such as false colors and zipper effects. The experimental results and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) value verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
