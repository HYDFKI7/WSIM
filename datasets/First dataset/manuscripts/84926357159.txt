Modeling and simulation of urination assist system driven by ultrasonic-vaporized steam Aiming at the problem of assisting the neurogenic bladder micturating, a novel urination assist system driven by ultrasonic-vaporized steam was proposed. The mathematical model of the multi-field coupling relation between the external ultrasonic controlling parameters and the urine flow rate of urinary bladder was built using ultrasonics, thermodynamics and fluid mechanics theories. The simulation analysis of the influence of the controlling parameters on the urine flow rate performance of the system was conducted. The results show that the urine flow rate are mainly affected by the ultrasonic sound intensity, frequency, radiation area and time, as well as the system structure and working medium parameters; the urine flow rate can be improved by increasing ultrasonic sound intensity, radiation area and time and decreasing frequency in physical therapy dose range; the maximum urine flow rate is approaching the normal human urodynamic parameters. The established mathematic models are simple and practicable, which provide the theoretical guidance for the performance analysis and structure design of the urination assist system.
