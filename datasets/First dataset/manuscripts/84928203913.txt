Study on crystallization of calcium carbonate from calcium sulfate and ammonium carbonate in the presence of magnesium ions Batch reactive crystallization of calcium carbonate (CaCO<inf>3</inf>) from ammonium carbonate ((NH<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf>) and calcium sulfate (CaSO<inf>4</inf>) was investigated in the presence of magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) ions. It was observed that Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions partly inhibited the conversion of CaSO<inf>4</inf> into CaCO<inf>3</inf>. When the content of Mg<sup>2+</sup> was less than 2%, the reduction in conversion rate of CaSO<inf>4</inf> was less than 2%, and the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions could be ignored. Effect of impurity on crystallization kinetics of CaCO<inf>3</inf>, including the growth rate and nucleation rate, was investigated. The results revealed that when Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions content was less than 1%, Mg<sup>2+</sup> could promote the growth of CaCO<inf>3</inf> and inhibit the nucleation process, which was favorable for the filtration of CaCO<inf>3</inf>.When the content of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions was greater than 1%, Mg<sup>2+</sup> inhibited the growth of CaCO<inf>3</inf>, which resulted in explosion nucleation and led to a large number of particles in the solution, which was unfavorable for the filtration of CaCO<inf>3</inf>. Based on the Bransom model, the particle size distribution equations of CaCO<inf>3</inf> were established. X-ray diffraction patterns and scanning electron microscopy images exhibited the existence of spherical vaterite of CaCO<inf>3</inf> due to the reaction of CaSO<inf>4</inf> with (NH<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf> under the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, which was inconsistent with the results reported in the literatures.
