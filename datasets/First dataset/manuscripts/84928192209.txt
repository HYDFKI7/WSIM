Lanthanide-doped fluoride core/multishell nanoparticles for broadband upconversion of infrared light The authors introduce a novel multilayer core/shell design to broadly upconvert infrared (IR) light at many discrete wavelengths into visible or near-IR (NIR) emissions. It utilizes hexagonal-phase core/multishell NaYF<inf>4</inf>:10%Er<sup>3+</sup>@NaYF<inf>4</inf>@NaYF<inf>4</inf>:10%Ho<sup>3+</sup>@NaYF<inf>4</inf>@NaYF<inf>4</inf>:1%Tm<sup>3+</sup>@NaYF<inf>4</inf> nanoparticles, where the active core as well as each active shell upconvert a distinct set of IR wavelength. The inert NaYF<inf>4</inf> layers in between these upconverting domains efficiently suppress the detrimental cross-relaxation processes between different types of lanthanide ions, thus yielding about two times more efficient upconversion photoluminescence than the counterpart NaYF<inf>4</inf>:10%Er<sup>3+</sup>@NaYF<inf>4</inf>:10%Ho<sup>3+</sup> @NaYF<inf>4</inf>:1%Tm<sup>3+</sup>@NaYF<inf>4</inf> without the inert NaYF<inf>4</inf> layers, and about one order of magnitude higher than the core/shell NaYF<inf>4</inf>:10%Er<sup>3+</sup>, 10%Ho<sup>3+</sup>, 1%Tm<sup>3+</sup>@NaYF<inf>4</inf> nanoparticles without spatially isolating the Er<sup>3+</sup>, Ho<sup>3+</sup>, and Tm<sup>3+</sup> ions. These core/multishell nanoparticles can be excited at ≈1120-1190 nm (due to Ho<sup>3+</sup>), ≈1190-1260 nm (due to Tm<sup>3+</sup>), and ≈1450-1580 nm (due to Er<sup>3+</sup>), collectively covering a broad spectral range of about 270 nm in the IR range that can be very useful for IR photosensitization of solar cells.
