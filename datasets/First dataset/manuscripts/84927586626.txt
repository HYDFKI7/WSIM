Lactosucrose attenuates intestinal inflammation by promoting Th2 cytokine production and enhancing CD86 expression in colitic rats Some oligosaccharides have immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory functions in the intestine. This study investigated the immunoregulatory effect of lactosucrose (LS) on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitic rats. Alkaline phosphatase activity was increased but myeloperoxidase activity was decreased in the LS-TNBS group, as compared with the TNBS group (colitis rats without receiving LS). LS supplementation stimulated IL-4 and IL-10 production, while up-regulating CD86 expression in dendritic cells. LS supplementation reduced the ratio of CD80/CD86 and the ratio of IFN- γ/IL-4 compared to the TNBS group. Moreover, IFN- γ was significantly correlated with CD80 (r = 0.764, p < 0.01), whereas IL-4 was significantly correlated with CD86 (r = 0.489, p < 0.05). These results indicated that LS attenuated colitis by promoting the production of Th2-type cytokines and rebalancing the ratio of Th1/Th2 and that enhanced IL-4 production is correlated with enhanced CD86 expression in the gut. Therefore, LS is a functional food for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
