A novel method of calculating the energy deposition curve of nanosecond pulsed surface dielectric barrier discharge To obtain the energy deposition curve is very important in the fields to which nanosecond pulse dielectric barrier discharges (NPDBDs) are applied. It helps the understanding of the discharge physics and fast gas heating. In this paper, an equivalent circuit model, composed of three capacitances, is introduced and a method of calculating the energy deposition curve is proposed for a nanosecond pulse surface dielectric barrier discharge (NPSDBD) plasma actuator. The capacitance C<inf>d</inf> and the energy deposition curve E<inf>R</inf> are determined by mathematically proving that the mapping from C<inf>d</inf> to E<inf>R</inf> is bijective and numerically searching one C<inf>d</inf> that satisfies the requirement for E<inf>R</inf> to be a monotonically non-decreasing function. It is found that the value of capacitance C<inf>d</inf> varies with the amplitude of applied pulse voltage due to the change of discharge area and is dependent on the polarity of applied voltage. The bijectiveness of the mapping from C<inf>d</inf> to E<inf>R</inf> in nanosecond pulse volumetric dielectric barrier discharge (NPVDBD) is demonstrated and the feasibility of the application of the new method to NPVDBD is validated. This preliminarily shows a high possibility of developing a unified approach to calculate the energy deposition curve in NPDBD.
