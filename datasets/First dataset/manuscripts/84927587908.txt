Annual performance investigation and economic analysis of heating systems with a compression-assisted air source absorption heat pump The compression-assisted air source absorption heat pump (CASAHP) is a promising alternative heating system in severe operating conditions. In this research, parameter studies on the annual performance under various compression ratios (CRs) and source temperatures are performed to achieve the maximum energy saving rates (ESRs). Economic analyses of the CASAHP under different CRs and partial-design ratios are conducted to obtain an optimal design that considers both energy savings and economy improvements. The results show that the optimal CR becomes higher in colder regions and with lower heat source temperatures. For a source temperature of 130 °C, the optimal CR values in all of the cities are within 2.0. For source temperatures from 100 to 130 °C, the maximum ESR is in the range of 17.7-29.2% in the studied cities. The efficiency improvement rate (EIR) caused by compression in a severe source condition can reach 10.0-20.0%. From the viewpoint of economy, the relative investment of CASAHP is reduced to 30-60% with a CR of 2.0-3.0. With a 2-6% sacrifice in ESR, the payback period can be reduced from 12-32 to 5-9 years using compression. Partial-design of the CASAHP can further reduce the payback period to 3-6 years with a partial-design ratio of 50% and a CR of 2.8. Additionally, CRs and partial-design ratios are designed comprehensively by seeking the maximum ESR for a given acceptable payback period.
