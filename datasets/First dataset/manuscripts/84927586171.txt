Sequence variation in mature microRNA-499 confers unfavorable prognosis of lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy confers unfavorable prognosis of lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy Purpose: This study was implemented to investigate the associations between SNP in mature microRNA (miRNA) sequence and lung cancer prognosis and to verify the function of those SNP. Experimental Design: Eight SNPs (rs3746444T>C in hsa-mir-499, rs4919510C>G in hsa-mir-608, rs13299349G>A in hsa-mir-3152, rs12220909G>C in hsa-mir-4293, rs2168518G>A in hsa-mir-4513, rs8078913T>C in hsa-mir-4520a, rs11237828T>C in hsa-mir-5579, and rs9295535T>C in hsa-mir-5689) were analyzed in a southern Chinese population with 576 patients with lung cancer, and the signifi cant results were validated in two additional cohorts of 346 and 368 patients, respectively. A series of experiments were performed to evaluate the relevancies of those potentially functional SNPs. Results: We found that the microRNA-499 rs3746444T>C polymorphism exhibited a consistently poor prognosis for patients with lung cancer in the discovery set [HR, 1.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.49; P = 0.028], in the validation set I (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.01-1.71; P = 0.048) and in the validation set II (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.12-1.86; P = 0.004). The adverse effect of CT/CC variants was more remarkable in patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. Further functional assays demonstrated that the rs3746444C variant allele influences the expression of several cancer-related genes and affects lung cancer cells' proliferation and tumor growth in vivo and in vitro via the cisplatinum resistance. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that the rs3746444T>C polymorphism in mature miR-499 sequence could contribute to poor prognosis by modulating cancer-related genes' expression and thus involve tumorigenesis and anti-chemotherapy, which may be a useful biomarker to predict lung cancer patients' prognosis.
