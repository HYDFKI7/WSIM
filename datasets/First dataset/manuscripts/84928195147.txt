Fault detection for a class of non-linear networked control systems with data drift In this paper, the fault detection problem is studied for a class of non-linear discrete-time networked control systems (NCSs). An individual stochastic variable satisfying a certain probabilistic distribution is utilised to describe the data drift of each sensor. The random transmission delays with the upper bound and the data drift phenomena are taken into account in a unified framework. By augmenting the states of the original non-linear NCS and the constructed full-order fault detection filter, the resulting fault detection dynamics is converted into an H<inf>∞</inf> filtering problem of a non-linear time-delay system. A sufficient condition for the existence of the designed fault detection filter is given in terms of a feasible linear matrix inequality, guaranteeing that the fault detection dynamics is stochastically stable and attains the prescribed H<inf>∞</inf> attenuation level. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
