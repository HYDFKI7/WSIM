Ginsenoside Rg3 sensitizes colon cancer cells to DNA damage reagents by inhibiting WEE1 kinase expression Recent research indicates that ginsenoside Rg3 can sensitize colon cancer cells to DNA damage reagents. But the molecular mechanisms of ginsenoside Rg3 function remain elusive. In this study we report the new mechanism by which ginsenoside Rg3 sensitize tumor cells to DNA damage reagents. Cell viability assays indicated that ginsenoside Rg3 sensitized WiDr, SW948, COLO205 colon cancer cell lines to cisplatin and 5-FU in dose-dependent manner. Real-time PCR results showed that ginsenoside Rg3 decreased WEE1 expression in dose- and time-dependent fashion. WEE1 plasmid was also constructed and transfected into tumor cell to overexpress WEE1. The results indicated that overexpression of WEE1 in colon cancer cell lines suppressed the sensitization effect of ginsenoside Rg3 to cisplatin and 5-FU. Our results indicate that ginsenoside Rg3 has the capability of sensitizing colon cancer cells to therapeutic DNA damage reagents by suppressing WEE1 expression and can be a good option of adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer patients.
