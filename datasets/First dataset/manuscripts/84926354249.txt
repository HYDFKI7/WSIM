Analysis on result of confirmation assays and nucleic acid test for plasma samples proved as anti-HCV positive by ELISA Objective To investigate the correlation between the results of confirmation assays (Western blot, WB) and nucleic acid test (NAT) for plasma samples proved as anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) positive by ELISA. Methods A total of 172 anti-HCV positive serum samples proved by primary screening were retested by one HCV antibody confirmation kit and one NAT kit. Results Of the 172 samples, 115 and 124 were confirmed as positive by WB and NAT respectively, while 100 as positive and 26 as negative by both tests. However, the confirmation results of 46 samples by the two tests were inconsistent. The stronger band intensity was, the higher NAT-positive rate was. Of the 46 samples with inconsistent results, 15 were confirmed as positive by WB and negative by NAT, while 16 were negative by WB and positive by NAT, 7 were indeterminate by WB and negative by NAT, and 8 were indeterminate by WB and positive by NAT. Conclusion There is some correlation and difference in the results of NAT and confirmation assay on plasma samples proved as anti-HCV positive by ELISA. WB and NAT should be used simultaneously in HCV test to ensure the safety of blood.
