Network equilibrium assignment model depended on stochastic reference point As a complement for describing travelers'boundedly rational route choice behavior by cumulative prospect theory, the stochastic reference point is explicitly considered. It is defined as a product of stochastic shortest travel time and acceptable coefficient. By assuming that travelers follow the rule of maximizing route cumulative prospect to choose the route, corresponding stochastic equilibrium condition and equivalent fixed point model are established. Then, a heuristic algorithm is given based on Probit loading and method of successive averages. The proposed model and algorithm are testified on a small network. Numerical results show that the traffic flow pattern depending on stochastic reference point can virtually represent travelers'boundedly rational behavior through average travel time and fluctuation. Due to the sensitivity analysis of parameters, the network equilibrium state from CPT remains unchanged with different travel time fluctuations, but varies when travelers adjust their travel time budgets.
