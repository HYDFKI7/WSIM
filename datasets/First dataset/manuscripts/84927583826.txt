Component content distribution profile control in rare earth countercurrent extraction process Considering that the on-line measurement and automatic control of element component content (ECC) are difficult to performin rare earth cascade extraction process, the ECC distribution profile is dynamically regulated at all stages to assess the effect of product purity control. Focusing on the theory of countercurrent extraction, the technology parameters and pre-setting flow-rates during the extract process are designed. Under varying process parameters, a novel step by step model is also proposed for each stage to analyze the impact on the distribution profile change. Combining themass balance model and ECC changing trend at themonitoring stage, the ECC distribution profile can be automatically regulated by dynamically compensating the related extract or scrubbing liquid flow-rate. To this end, the required product purity at the two outlets is achieved. Based on Wincc and Matlab dynamic simulators, a specific Pr/Nd cascade extraction process is used to illustrate and demonstrate the application of the present approach.
