Linear distortion measurement and compensation for an LED communication system In order to eliminate the effect of linear distortion on the characteristics of fluorescent LED based communication system, an experimental system based on fluorescent LED is established, a network analyzer is then used to analyze amplitude-frequency response curve of the system, and the linear distortion performance is analyzed. Based on the attenuation characteristics of the amplitude-frequency response, the first-, second-and third-order high-pass filters are designed as linear distortion compensation circuits, and the amplitude-frequency response curve of the system with distortion compensation is further measured with the network analyzer. Experimental results indicate that by using the third-order post-equalization circuit, the linear distortion of the system is obviously improved, and the decrease of the gain is improved from 50 dB within the range of 0.3-6 MHz before compensation to 20 dB within the range of 0.3-45 MHz with 3rd order compensation. To ensure relatively flat gain characteristics of the communication system and obtain a small gain variation of less than 10 dB, the bandwidth is enlarged from 1.8 MHz before compensation to 41 MHz (the range is 3-44 MHz) with 3rd order compensation, indicating an increase factor of 23, and within this frequency range, a larger gain of -30 dB is also achieved. Therefore, by compensating the linear distortion of the communication system, its bandwidth can be effectively enlarged. The proposed experimental and analytical results in this paper can provide data basis for system parameter optimization and further improvement in communication performance.
