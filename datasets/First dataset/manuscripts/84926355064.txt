Sulfide oxidation and nitrate reduction for potential mitigation of H<inf>2</inf>S in landfills Because H<inf>2</inf>S emitted by landfill sites has seriously endangered human health, its removal is urgent. H<inf>2</inf>S removal by use of an autotrophic denitrification landfill biocover has been reported. In this process, nitrate-reducing and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria use a reduced sulfur source as electron donor when reducing nitrate to nitrogen gas and oxidizing sulfur compounds to sulfate. The research presented here was performed to investigate the possibility of endogenous mitigation of H<inf>2</inf>S by autotrophic denitrification of landfill waste. The sulfide oxidation bioprocess accompanied by nitrate reduction was observed in batch tests inoculated with mineralized refuse from a landfill site. Repeated supply of nitrate resulted in rapid oxidation of the sulfide, indicating that, to a substantial extent, the bioprocess may be driven by functional microbes. This bioprocess can be realized under conditions suitable for the autotrophic metabolic process, because the process occurred without addition of acetate. H<inf>2</inf>S emissions from landfill sites would be substantially reduced if this bioprocess was introduced.
