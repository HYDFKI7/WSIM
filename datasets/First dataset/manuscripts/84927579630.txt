Adaptive tracking control for a class of Markovian jump systems with time-varying delay and actuator faults This paper is concerned with the output tracking control problem for a class of continuous-time Markovian jump systems with time-varying delay and actuator faults. The transition probabilities considered are more general, which include completely known ones, completely unknown ones and the unknown but with known bounds. In order to attenuate the effect of actuator degradation, a virtual tracking model is constructed using the normal control law. Then, an adaptive control method is employed to make the states of fault augmented model asymptotically track those of a virtual tracking model, which means that the fault-tolerant tracking controller can be designed to achieve the goal of system output tracking the reference signal asymptotically. In the proposed approach, the adaptive laws involving in the connections among various system modes are constructed with such a novel structure that the fault estimation is fast enough and the high-frequency oscillations can be reduced effectively. Finally, the numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
