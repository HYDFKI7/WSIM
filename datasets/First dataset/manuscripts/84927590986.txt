Critical adsorption of a flexible polymer on a stripe-patterned surface The adsorption and dynamics of a polymer chain on a stripe-patterned surface composed of periodical attractive and neutral stripes are studied by using Monte Carlo simulation. The critical adsorption temperature T<inf>c</inf> and pattern-recognition temperature T<inf>r</inf> are estimated from the desorption probability, surface contact number, and bridge number. A phase diagram presenting three polymer states, including a desorbed state above T<inf>c</inf>, a multi-stripe adsorbed state at an intermediate temperature T<inf>r</inf> < T < T<inf>c</inf>, and a single-stripe adsorbed state below T<inf>r</inf>, is provided for infinitely long chains. Normal diffusion is always observed for a polymer in the direction parallel to the stripe even at low temperature. But in the direction perpendicular to the stripe, the polymer can freely diffuse above T<inf>c</inf>, whereas the polymer is confined to one attractive stripe below T<inf>r</inf>. However, the adsorbed polymer can hop from one attractive stripe to another at the intermediate temperature T<inf>r</inf> < T < T<inf>c</inf>.
