Low fouling label-free DNA sensor based on polyethylene glycols decorated with gold nanoparticles for the detection of breast cancer biomarkers A label-free and low fouling biosensor based on functional polyethylene glycols selective for breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA1) is reported. Sensory interfaces were prepared through the modification of a glassy carbon electrode with highly cross-linked polyethylene glycol (PEG) film containing amine groups, followed by the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles and the immobilization of BRCA1 complementary single-strand 19-mer oligonucleotides. In the presence of a specific BRCA1 sequence capture and hybridization results in interfacial change sensitively monitored using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The combined utilization of a PEG polymer film and gold nanoparticle mixed interface enables very high levels of sensitivity and a highly effective assaying in patient samples. Assay linear range was from 50.0. fM to 1.0. nM, with a limit of detection of 1.72. fM. Furthermore, this label-free DNA sensor has been used for assaying BRCA1 in serum samples, showing its feasible potential for diagnostic applications in clinical analysis of breast cancer gene BRCA1. Foreseeable, this sensor made on this basis undoubtedly provide the most effective and sensitive detection for BRCA1.
