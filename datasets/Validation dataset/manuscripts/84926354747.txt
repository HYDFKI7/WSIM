Design of terahertz waveguide-fed antipodal hyperbolic-sine tapered slot antenna based on silicon micromachine A THz antipodal hyperbolic-sine tapered slot antenna (AHSTSA) designed on silicon is proposed in this paper. The antenna is feed by WR2.2 waveguide and work at 480GHz to 500GHz. The antipodal curved slots and feeding waveguide are designed to be monolithically fabricated by deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE), then sputtering gold, with gold-gold thermo-compression bonding at last. The simulation result of VSWR is below 1.25 within 480GHz to 520GHz. The AHSTSA shows asymmetric beamwidths of ∼20° in both E- and H-plane, with a maximum gain of 17.7dBi. The cross polarization and sidelobe levels are less than -20.7dBi and -10.6dBi, respectively. The proposed AHSTSA can be used in THz imaging and detection systems.
