Material data management during product development for environment protection In order to meet China’s ‘Requirements for Prohibited Substances on Automobiles’ and EU ELV 2000/53/EC, OEMs request the suppliers to comply with the relevant regulation requirements. Considering the regulation, customer, and selfrequirements, the United Automotive Electronic Systems Co., Ltd. develops the material data management system (MDS). With the system implementation, the prohibited substance management is fully integrated into the production development process. In order to attach the goal of high efficiency, accuracy, convenience, and real time for material management during product development, the system includes several functions, such as prohibition substance analysis, material report submission, flexible configuration due to regulations, traceability of material usage, historical material data storage, and real-time data exchange with International Material Data System (IMDS) or China Automotive Material Data System (CAMDS). The working efficiency and data safety are improved with this system.
