An upper bound analysis of t-shaped equal channel angular pressing T-shaped equal channel angular pressing (T-shaped ECAP) is a novel process of severe plastic deformation (SPD). The maximum effective strain per pass in the T-shaped ECAP is larger than that in the ECAP. Deformation models of the T-shaped ECAP have been proposed by a designed grids deformation experiment considering the deformation dead zone (DDZ) formation or without it. Based on the deformation models, an upper bound approach has been used to analyse the T-shaped ECAP process. The effects of the plastic deformation zone (PDZ) angles and the friction factor on the relative pressing pressure and the DDZ are analysed. It is found that the relative pressing pressure increases with an increase of the angle and the friction factor m, however, the DDZ decreases. The upper bound solution for the T-shaped ECAP with the DDZ is more close to the experimental load than that without the DDZ. The results show that there is a good agreement between the theoretical value and the measured maximum load required for the T-shaped ECAP conducting.
