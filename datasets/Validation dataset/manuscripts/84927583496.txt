A novel method for constructing a WIFI positioning system with efficient manpower With the rapid development of WIFI technology, WIFI-based indoor positioning technology has been widely studied for location-based services. To solve the problems related to the signal strength database adopted in the widely used fingerprint positioning technology, we first introduce a new system framework in this paper, which includes a modified AP firmware and some cheap self-made WIFI sensor anchors. The periodically scanned reports regarding the neighboring APs and sensor anchors are sent to the positioning server and serve as the calibration points. Besides the calculation of correlations between the target points and the neighboring calibration points, we take full advantage of the important but easily overlooked feature that the signal attenuation model varies in different regions in the regression algorithm to get more accurate results. Thus, a novel method called RSSI Geography Weighted Regression (RGWR) is proposed to solve the fingerprint database construction problem. The average error of all the calibration pointsâ€™ self-localization results will help to make the final decision of whether the database is the latest or has to be updated automatically. The effects of anchors on system performance are further researched to conclude that the anchors should be deployed at the locations that stand for the features of RSSI distributions. The proposed system is convenient for the establishment of practical positioning system and extensive experiments have been performed to validate that the proposed method is robust and manpower efficient.
