Lateral wedging of the cemented vertebra after balloon kyphoplasty: A case report Balloon kyphoplasty has been shown to be safe in treatment of vertebral compression fractures refractory to conservative management. However, few reports have focused on lateral wedging of cemented vertebra after kyphoplasty. A 72-year-old woman with a T12 osteoporotic compression fracture underwent kyphoplasty using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) via a bipedicular approach. The patient felt pain free, whereas she did not receive anti-osteoporosis treatment after the surgery. The abnormal spatial distribution of PMMA cement within the T12 vertebral body and cement leakage right lateral to the vertebral body was observed in postoperative radiographs. Twelve months later, lateral wedging of the cemented vertebra was detected in plain radiographs. In the kyphoplasty procedure, symmetric cement filling should be achieved to avoid lateral wedging of the cemented vertebra. Postoperative anti-osteoporotic medication treatment is also very important.
