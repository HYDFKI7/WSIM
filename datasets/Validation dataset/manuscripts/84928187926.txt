Preparation and performance of Cu-SiO<inf>2</inf> catalyst for H<inf>2</inf> production from methanol on vehicle Using copper nitrate and sodium water glass as materials, the Cu-SiO<inf>2</inf> catalyst was prepared by co-precipitation method. The performance of Cu-SiO<inf>2</inf> for methanol decomposition was studied in a fixed down-flow reactor. The influence of reaction temperature and WHSV were investigated. The evaluation results show that the Cu-SiO<inf>2</inf> without pre-reduction by H<inf>2</inf> gives a high catalytic activity for methanol decomposition, and exhibits a good regeneration property. At 300 Â°C, WHSV of 0. 79 h<sup>-1</sup> and atmospheric pressure, the conversion of methanol increases from initial 75. 8% to 85. 6% at 48 h, and then remains at about 85% within 144 h. The main products are hydrogen and carbon monoxide. A few of methyl formate and other products are also found. The influence of the temperature and WHSV on the activity of the catalyst is significant, but small on the products distribution. The test results indicate that the catalyst (Cu-SiO<inf>2</inf>) has a good applicability for the hydrogen production from the methanol on vehicle.
