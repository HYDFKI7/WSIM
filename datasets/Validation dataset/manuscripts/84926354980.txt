Rotating machine fault feature extraction based on reduced time frequency representation Aiming at extracting fault features from the two-dimensional time frequency representation, a novel time frequency feature extraction method based on reduced time frequency representation is proposed after investigating the principles of basis pursuit and Two Dimensional Non-negative Matrix Factorization (2DNMF). Combined with Wigner-Ville distribution, the basis pursuit method which represents the original signal as a set of atoms is introduced to compute the basis pursuit time frequency representation, and then 2DNMF is employed to reduce the dimension of the amplitude matrix of basis pursuit time frequency representation and extract its corresponding low dimensional features. The proposed method is applied to extract the fault features from eight different state rolling bearings, and the results verify its effectiveness.
