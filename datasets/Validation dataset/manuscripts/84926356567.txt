Research of urban rail transit construction level based on the principal component analysis from the perspective of DEA Nowadays, traffic jam is becoming serious. More and more cities in China begin construction rail transit in order to solve this problem. Taking Beijing as an example, this paper ascertains the evaluation index reasonably, allocates the weights for each index using the DEA model, and conforms the rail transit and economic & social development evaluation index based on the principal component analysis. It reveals the numerical relationship between rail transit construction and economic & social. The calculation results show that, compared with the economic and social development, Beijing's rail transit construction level is in the advanced state at present. According to the Beijing's goals for economic and social development in future, this paper forecasts Beijing rail transit construction's reasonable level.
