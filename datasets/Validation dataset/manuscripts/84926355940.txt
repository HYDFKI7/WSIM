Effect of Kidsolone on isolated rat’s tracheal smooth muscle Purpose: Prednisolone (Kidsolone) is an anti-inflammatory drug that is mainly used for patients with chronic obstructive airway diseases (COAD), such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD). The objective of this study was to determine the effects of Kidsolone on the trachea of rats in vitro. Materials and Methods: We tested the effectiveness of Kidsolone on isolated rat trachea submersed in Krebs solution in a muscle bath. Changes in tracheal contractility in response to the application of parasympathetic mimetic agents were measured. The following assessments of Kidsolone were performed: (1) Effect on tracheal smooth muscle resting tension; (2) effect on contraction caused by 10<sup>-6</sup>. M methacholine; (3) effect of the drug on electrically-induced tracheal smooth muscle contractions. Result: Our results demonstrated that no significant effects were induced by the addition of 10<sup>-8</sup>–10<sup>-5</sup>. M Kidsolone on tracheal tension after methacholine treatment, indicating that Kidsolone had no anti-cholinergic effect. It alone had a minimal effect on the basal tension of the trachea as the concentration increased. Furthermore, Kidsolone did not affect electrical field stimulation-induced spike contraction, which represent the Kidsolone could not antagonize the parasympathetic innervation responsible for trachea smooth muscle contraction. Conclusion: The immediate effect of Kidsolone on COAD may be indirectly. Therefore, sorely use of inhalation Kidsolone without β2-agonist in treating acute asthma or COPD attack may be more suboptimal than co-administration of them.
