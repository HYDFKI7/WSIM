Osteopontin can decrease the expression of col-ii and COMP in cartilage cells in vitro Objective: To observe the effect of osteopontin (OPN) on the expression of collagen type II (Col-II) and oligomeric matrix protein COMP in cartilage cells of knee osteoarthritis, and explore the mechanism of OPN in the knee osteoarthritis. Methods: Cartilage cells were isolated from fetal rabbit, they were divided into 3 groups: A (control); B (0.5 μM OPN) and C (1 μM OPN). The expression levels of Col-2 and COMP were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting methods. MMP-13 was detected using ELISA. The proliferation was determined by MTT method. Results: Compared with the group, the expression levels of Col-2 and COMP in cartilage cells decreased in the intervention group with dose dependent (P<0.05). The expression of MMP-13 in culture supernatant and the proliferation increased in the intervention group (P<0.05). Conclusion: OPN can down-regulate the expression levels of Col-2 and COMP in cartilage cells and up-regulate the expression of MMP-13 in culture supernatant and promote the proliferation of cells, which could accelerate the pathological process of cartilage cells.
