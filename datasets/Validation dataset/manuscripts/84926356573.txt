Numerical simulation for train brake disc ventilation Convective heat transfer is an important way to reduce the temperature of the brake disc friction surface. For the train brake discs with cooling ribs, the CFD-ACE software was used to study the variation of the brake disc internal channel velocity field, temperature field and the convective heat transfer coefficient of the different forms of rib structure and layout. The study found that the convective heat transfer coefficient (CHTC) of brake disc ventilation channel decreases along the inner diameter to the outer diameter, and the leading sides are higher than the trailing sides significantly. The discontinuous distribution of the radial ribs can improve 7.4% of the average CHTC for the brake disc with the air, and the increase in short ribs between the long rib enhances 17.2% of the brake disc heat transfer. The volume heat transfer is proposed to evaluate the effective heat exchange efficiency.
