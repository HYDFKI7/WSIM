Systemic sclerosis presenting with severe digital ischemia: A rare case report Digital ischemic loss is a cause of significant morbidity in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Both small and large digital arteries are involved causing perfusion defects leading to ischemia. Microvascular disease causes intimal proliferation and luminal narrowing of small digital arteries, macrovascular disease causes narrowing or occlusion of larger digital arteries. Immediate clinical evaluation and treatment are mandatory at the onset of critical digital ischemia to prevent digital loss. We present a case of 38-year-old female suffering from SSc who presented with acute onset severe digital ischemia of all four limbs.
