Clinical features of colorectal adenomatous polyp in elderly patients: analysis of 178 cases Background: It has been widely accepted that colorectal adenomatous polyp as an important premalignant lesion is closely associated with the risk of colorectal cancer. Aims: To analyze the clinical features of colorectal adenomatous polyp in elderly patients. Methods: One hundred and seventy-eight elderly patients with colorectal adenomatous polyp diagnosed by colonoscopy and pathological examination from January 2011 to July 2014 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University were enrolled, and gender, age, location, size, pathological type, dysplasia and cancerization were retrospectively analyzed. Results: No significant differences in distribution of adenomatous polyp in patients with different gender, age and size were found (P>0.05). With the increase of adenomatous polyp size, the detection rate of tubular adenomatous polyp was decreased and the detection rate of tubular-villous adenomatous polyp was increased (P<0.01), and incidence of moderate to severe dysplasia and cancerization rate were increased (P<0.01). The degree of dysplasia and cancerization rate were higher in tubular-villous adenomatous polyp than in tubular adenomatous polyp (P<0.01). Conclusions: With the increase of adenomatous polyp size, the incidence of tubular-villous adenomatous polyp, degree of dysplasia and cancerization rate are increased, early detection and treatment of adenomatous polyp can effectively reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer in elderly patients.
