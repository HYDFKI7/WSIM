Self-assembly, crystal structures and properties of metal-3,4,5-tris(carboxymethoxy)benzoic acid frameworks based on polynuclear metal-hydroxyl clusters (M = Zn, Co) 3,4,5-Tris(carboxymethoxy)benzoic acid (H<inf>4</inf>TCBA) has been used as a structure-directing agent to prepare three new inorganic-organic hybrid frameworks based on polynuclear metal-hydroxyl clusters, [Zn<inf>2.5</inf>(OH)(TCBA)(H<inf>2</inf>O)<inf>4</inf>]·H<inf>2</inf>O (1), [Zn<inf>2.5</inf>(OH)(TCBA)(H<inf>2</inf>O)] (2), [Co<inf>3</inf>(OH)<inf>2</inf>(TCBA)(H<inf>2</inf>O)<inf>4</inf>]·2H<inf>2</inf>O (3) through hydro/solvothermal reactions. The results show that complexes 1 and 2 both own I<sup>0</sup>O<sup>3</sup> hybrid frameworks with a highly-connected binodal 4,8-c network, while 3 reveals a I<sup>0</sup>O<sup>2</sup> hybrid framework with a 3,6-c 2-nodal topology. The multiple coordination system originated from the branching out carboxylate groups in TCBA ligands results in the formation of the multi-stranded helical chains in the high-dimensional metal-organic frameworks of complexes 1-3. The thermal stabilities of complexes 1-3, the photophysical properties of complexes 1 and 2 and the magnetic properties of complex 3 were also investigated. Complexes 1 and 2 emit strong blue light under ultraviolet light, and complex 3 shows typical paramagnetic behavior and an interesting partial spin-crossover has been observed. This journal is
