HMAC-SHA1 applied in the diagnosis service for security access As automobile comfort and security requirement are increasing, more and more ECUs have been developed. Automobile structure is becoming more complex; therefore, after-sales service is also getting more and more important. Diagnostic tester is the key equipment for after-sales service. To protect the information of the vehicle and the owner, it is not allowed that other testers are used for repairing or changing parameters except the OEM own testers. Tester communicates with ECU only after passing the security access. To ensure the confidentiality, uniqueness, and absoluteness of the security access algorithm, HMAC-SHA1 is a better choice for security access.
