Industrial application of amberlyst 35 resin catalyst in FCC light gasoline etherification The industrial applications of the positive ion resin catalyst Amberlyst 35 in FCC light gasoline etherification unit of A and B companies were introduced. The results indicate that the catalyst has outstanding characteristics of high activity and simple starting-up. Both A and B company can produce low olefin and premium etherified gasoline over the catalyst. By a three-stage etherification, the total conversion rates of isoamylene are 97. 59%, 95. 54% and the selectivities of tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME) are 93. 48%, 97. 15% under the working conditions of case I and case II, respectively in company A. The total conversion rate of isoamylene is 97. 21% and the TAME selectivity is 87. 15 % in company B.
