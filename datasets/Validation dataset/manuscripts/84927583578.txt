The Active Control of Maglev Stationary Self-Excited Vibration with a Virtual Energy Harvester This paper addresses the active control of stationary self-excited vibration, which degrades the stability of the levitation control, decreases the ride comfort, and restricts the construction cost of the maglev system. First, a minimum interaction model containing a flexible bridge and a single levitation unit is presented. Based on the minimum interaction model, the principle underlying the self-excited vibration is explored. It shows that the active property of the levitation system is the root of self-excited vibration. Consider that the energy of vibration may be absorbed by the electromagnetic energy harvester (EEH), so that a technique applying it to the bridge is proposed, and the stability of the combined system is analyzed. However, its hardware structure is complicated, and the cost of construction is prohibitive. Then the novel conception of the virtual EEH is brought forward, which uses the electromagnetic force to emulate the force of a real energy harvester acting on the bridge. With the estimation of the vertical velocity of the bridge and the frequency of vibration, the self-oscillatory is avoided as well by adding an extra control instruction to the electromagnet. After building the overall dynamic model with details, numerical simulations and field experiments are carried out, and the results illustrating the improvement of stability are provided and analyzed.
