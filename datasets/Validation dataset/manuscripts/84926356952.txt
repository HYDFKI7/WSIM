Numerical study of the contact pressure of window-type vane seals: Part i The contact pressure at the sealing surface is one of the most important parameters for evaluating the sealing performance of vane seals. This article - which appears in two instalments - looks at the development of a numerical model of the contact pressure for window-type vane seals. It also provides details of a parametric calculation that was performed to study the effects of certain parameters on contact pressure. The first part, which appears here, describes the computational model and its application, including initial data and the section shape of the vane seals.
