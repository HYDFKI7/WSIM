Research on U-shape steel frame and anchor cable collaborative support mechanism and loading law of roadway under dynamical pressure impact In order to overcome the support difficulty of roadway severe deformation supported by U-shape steel frame under dynamical pressure impact, a numerical simulation was conducted to study the function mechanism of U-shape steel frame and anchor cable collaborative support, and a U-shape steel frame and anchor cable collaborative support technology was proposed. Meanwhile the field measurement method was used to monitor the surface displacement of roadway surrounding rock and the practical bearing situation of U-shape steel frame and structure compensation anchor cable during the influence process of riding mining pressure. The results show that: the technology of U-shape steel frame and anchor cable collaborative support is obviously useful for improving the surrounding rock stress, increasing the residual strength of roadway shallow surrounding rock, optimizing the bearing characteristic of U-shape steel frame, magnifying the bearing capacity and non-deformability of U-shape steel frame, and improving the overall stability of U-shape steel frame. When surrounding rock deformation pressure is large, the U-shape steel frame will deform with surrounding rock and the biggest deformation pressure presents at the roadway's sides and humeral pits, where the anchor cable can provide deformation resistance to prevent the interior convex deformation of U-shape steel frame. As an integral structure, the U-shape steel frame is bound to the limited deformation space, and its rest large deformation is released through the slip of frame's lap joint, then the high resistance and contractibility characteristic of U-shape steel frame is achieved.
