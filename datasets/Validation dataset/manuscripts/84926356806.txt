Effect of PDCD4 targeted siRNA interference on human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line Eca109 Background: PDCD4 is a new tumor suppressor gene, and its expression is related to the malignant transformation of many tumors. However, its role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been fully clarified. Aims: To study the effect of PDCD4 silencing on proliferation, migration, apoptosis of ESCC cell line Eca109 in vitro. Methods: Eca109 cells were divided into three groups: non-transfected Eca109 cells (blank control group), Eca109 cells transfected with nonsense sequence (negative control group) and Eca109 cells transfected with PDCD4 siRNA (si-PDCD4 group). Expression of PDCD4 protein was detected by Western blotting. Cell proliferation was determined by CCK-8 assay, cell clone was determined by colony-forming assay, flow cytometry was used to determine cell apoptosis, and cell migration was measured by Transwell migration assay. Results: Compared with blank control group and negative control group, expression of PDCD4 protein was significantly reduced (P<0.05), cell proliferation was significantly increased (P<0.05), colony-forming was significantly increased (P<0.05), apoptosis rate was significantly decreased (P<0.05), and migration was significantly increased in si-PDCD4 group (P<0.05). Conclusions: siRNA targeting PDCD4 can promote Eca109 cell proliferation and migration, and inhibit cell apoptosis in vitro, which provides a new evidence for studying the diagnosis and treatment of ESCC.
