Experimental investigations of driving frequency effect in low-pressure capacitively coupled oxygen discharges The effect of driving frequency on the electron density is investigated in low-pressure capacitively coupled oxygen plasmas by utilizing a floating hairpin probe. The power absorbed by the plasma is investigated and it is found that the power lost in the matching network can reach 50% or higher under certain conditions. The effect of driving frequency on the electron density is studied from two aspects, i.e., constant absorbed power and electrode voltage. In the former case, the electron density increases with the driving frequency increasing from 13.56 to 40.68 MHz and slightly changes depending on the gas pressures with the frequency further increasing to 100 MHz. In the latter case, the electron density rapidly increases when the driving frequency increases from 13.56 to 40.68 MHz, and then decreases with the frequency further increasing to 100 MHz. The electron series resonance is observed at 40.68 MHz and can be attributed to the higher electron density. And the standing wave effect also plays an important role in increasing electron density at 100 MHz and 2.6 Pa.
