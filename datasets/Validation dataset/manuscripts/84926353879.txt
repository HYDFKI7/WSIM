Association between cadherin-17 expression and pathological characteristics of gastric cancer: A meta-analysis AIM: To construct a meta-analysis in order to examine the relationship between cadherin-17 (CDH17) and gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: Related articles were selected by searching the following English or Chinese electronic databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE, Science Citation Index, the Chinese Journal Full-Text, and the Weipu Journal. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) criteria were used to ensure consistency in reviewing and reporting results. Statistical analyses were conducted with Version 12.0 STATA statistical software. RESULTS: Ultimately, 11 articles, with a total of 2,120 GC patients, were found to be eligible for study inclusion. In comparisons of GC patients by TNM stage (III-IV vs I - II: OR = 2.35, 95%CI: 1.15-4.825, P = 0.019), histologic grade (3-4 vs 1-2: OR = 3.48, 95%CI: 1.36-8.92, P = 0.009), invasion grade (T3-4 vs T1-2: OR = 2.86; 95%CI: 1.69-4.83; P = 0.000), and lymph node metastasis (positive vs negative: OR = 2.64; 95%CI: 1.33-5.27; P = 0.006), it was found that CDH17 showed more positive expressions in each of the more severe cases. Country-stratified analyses from all four experimental subgroups showed that high CDH17 expression levels may be related to GC among Chinese and Korean populations (all P < 0.05), with the exception of the invasion grade T3-4 vs T1-2 comparison, where the relation only held among the Chinese population (OR = 2.86, 95%CI: 1.69-4.83, P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Collectively, the data reflects the capacity of CDH17 in tumor proliferation and metastasis among GC patients.
