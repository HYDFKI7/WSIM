MiR-19a promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition through PI3K/AKT pathway in gastric cancer AIM: To investigate the mechanism by which miR-19a is up-regulated in gastric cancer (GC), which plays an oncogenic role. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the role of miR-19a in gastric tissues as well as two GC cell lines. In vivo, we detected the basal expression level of miR-19a using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RTPCR), and the relevance between expression of miR-19a and clinicopathological information was analyzed. In vitro, miR-19a was ectopically expressed using overexpression and knock-down strategies. RESULTS: Overexpression of miR-19a was significantly associated with metastasis of GC and inferior overall prognosis. However, no significant correlation was found between miR-19a expression and other characteristics such as age, gender, tobacco, alcohol or tumor size. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays showed that overexpression of miR-19a promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion, and that overexpression of miR-19a promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition through activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. Blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway could cancel the effect of miR-19a. CONCLUSION: All together, our results suggest that miR-19a could be used as a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of GC.
