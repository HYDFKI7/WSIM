Study on micros-tructure and performance of cold-rolled plate components produced by numerical controlled incremental forming To study the mechanism of forming limit enhancement in sheet incremental forming, a cold-rolled-sheet square frustum was incrementally formed on a numerical controlled milling machine. The change of the micro-structure in the process was studied by using metallographic microscope and scanning electron microscope(SEM), and compared with normal stamping process. It was found that cold-rolled sheets can be incrementally formed to produce components; under sump lubrication, the incremental deformation was cold since the heat produced by friction was not enough to change part's microstructure; the microstructure told that the contact part of sheet was smashed and uniformly enlarged later, which demonstrated that the deformation in incremental process is local, alternative, and little increment, and the uniform distribution of deformation enhances the forming ability.
