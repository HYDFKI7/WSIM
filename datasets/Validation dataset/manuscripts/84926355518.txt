Reasonable selection of rheological parameters of geosynthetics The influence of rheological properties of geosynthetics in engineering should be considered properly. For this purpose, a creep reduction factor is considered in the design tensile strength. However, the selected value of this factor is too conservative in the current time. Based on the test results, the stress level applied on geosynthetic materials is the critical factor for the influence of creep on rupture. Whereas, according to the monitoring data from international and domestic reinforced structures, the stress level for geosynthetics reinforcement is mostly quite low, and it is only several percent of the design tensile strength. The largest values of stress and deformation in reinforcement appear at the end of construction time. Moreover, some creep tests are performed under the condition without any lateral pressure on test specimen, and the influence of creep will be enlarged. Otherwise, the relaxation property should be concerned for reinforced structures, and it will reduce the influence of creep. Finally, the reasonable value of creep reduction factor is suggested.
