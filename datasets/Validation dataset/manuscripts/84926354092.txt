A significance model for virtual view synthesis in error prone network In order to relief the virtual view's quality reduction induced by the transmission distortion, we propose a macro block level significance model applied to both depth map and texture map. The model contains two main parts: firstly, by considering the temporal and spatial correlation of the compression structure and the distortion diffusion due to lost packets, we propose a recursive transmission distortion model; secondly, we discuss the relationship between synthesis distortion and both depth-error and texture-error induced distortions. A low-complexity significance model based on the analysis of synthesis distortion is proposed. Experimental results show that compared with random packet loss, the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of the virtual view could be increased dramatically (up to 15.65 dB at 20% packet loss rate), and the subjective quality is close to the undistorted transmission condition.
