Effect of preemptive intravenous oxycodone on low-dose bupivacaine spinal anesthesia with intrathecal sufentanil Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of preemptive intravenous oxycodone on low-dose bupivacaine spinal anesthesia with intrathecal sufentanil in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Methods: In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, 60 patients undergoing TURP were allocated into 2 groups: oxycodone group (group O, n=30) and a normal saline group (group N, n=30). Oxycodone 0.1 mg/kg, or normal saline 0.1 ml/kg was administered intravenously 10 minutes before surgical procedures in group O, or in group N. All patients received sufentanil 5 Î¼g + bupivacaine 0.5% (0.8 ml) + normal saline 0.7 ml - in total, bupivacaine 0.25% (1.6 ml) intrathecally. Spinal block characteristics, hemodynamic values, the perioperative analgesic requirements, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, Ramsay sedation scale, and side effects were assessed. The study was carried out at the First Hospital of Jilin University, Jilin, China between March and September 2014. Results: The time to 2-segment regression of sensory block, full recovery of sensory block, and first analgesic request was longer in group O. Fewer patients required postoperative analgesics, and the VAS pain scores at 4, 8, 16, and 24 hour after operation were significantly lower in group O. Conclusion: Preemptive intravenous oxycodone was an efficient and safe method to decrease postoperative pain and reduce tramadol analgesia in patients under low-dose dilute bupivacaine spinal anesthesia combined with intrathecal sufentanil.
