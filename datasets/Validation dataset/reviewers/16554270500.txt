9744281824	Development and distribution of mast cells and neuropeptides in human fetus duodenum	Aim: To study the developmental regularities and heterogeneity of mast cells (MC) in human fetus duodenum and the distribution and developmental regularities of substance P(SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive (IR) peptidergic nerves in fetus duodenum, as well as the relationship between MC, SP and CGRP-IR peptidergic nerves. Methods: Duodena from 21 cases of human fetus and one term infant were stained by hematoxylin-eosin (HE), toluidine blue (TB) and immunohistochemical avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (ABC) method. Results: Lobe-shape intestinal villi in duodenum were already developed at the twelfth week. At the 21st wk, muscular mucosa appeared gradually, and four layers were observed in the wall of duodenum. TB staining showed that the granules in the immature MC were pale violet, while the mature MC were strong violet in color by TB staining. Connective tissue MC (CTMC) appeared occasionally in submucosa and muscular layer of duodenum at the 16th wk. While the mucosa MC (MMC) appeared at the 18th wk. At the 22nd wk, both CTMC and MMC were activated, and distributed in the surrounding blood vessels and ganglions. The verge of some MC were unclear, and showed degranular phenomena. At the 14th wk, SP and CGRP-IR nerve fibers and cells appeared in the myenteric and submucous plexuses in small intestine, and the responses were turn strongly. Neurons were light to deep brown, and nerve fibers were present as varicose and liner profiles. On the corresponding site of serial sections, SP and CGRP immunohistochemical reactions were coexisted in one nerve fiber or cell. Some of MC showed SP and CGRP-IR positive staining. Conclusion: There are two heterogeneous kinds of MC in duodenum, MMC and CTMC. MC might play an important role in regulating blood circulation and sensation. Copyright © 2004 by The WJG.

14844331723	Chemopreventive effects of rofecoxib and folic acid on gastric carcinogenesis induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in rats	Background: Epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are chemopreventive agents of gastrointestinal cancers, but few studies have been carried out on gastric cancer. The decrease in folic acid supplement and subsequent DNA hypomethylation are related to gastrointestinal cancers, and it has been shown that high dose folic acid may interfere with the gastric carcinogenesis. Aims: To investigate the chemopreventive effects of rofecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, and folic acid on the development of gastric cancer induced by N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in Wistar rats, and to assess the cell proliferation of gastric mucosa in different experimental groups. Methods: Eighty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (16 rats each). In the control group, the rats were given pure water and basal diet. In the MNNG group, the rats received MNNG in drinking water (100 mg/L) and basal diet. In the MNNG + low dose rofecoxib group, the rats were administered MNNG and rofecoxib 5 mg/kg per day and basal diet. In the MNNG + high dose rofecoxib group, the rats were given MNNG and rofecoxib 15 mg/kg per day and basal diet, and in the MNNG + folic acid group, the rats received MNNG and folic acid 5 mg/kg per day and basal diet. The experiments were terminated at the 50 weeks, all rats were sacrificed and 3 ml venous blood were obtained for measurement of serum folic acid concentrations in the control group, the MNNG group and the MNNG + folic acid group by using chemiluminescent method. The stomach was removed in all rats for histopathological exam and immunohistochemical study [proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in gastric epithelial cells]. Results: In the MNNG group, 5 out of 11 rats (45.5%) developed gastric cancer, while in all other 4 groups no gastric cancer was found (P<0.05). The positivity rates of PCNA expression in the cancerous tissues were significantly higher than those in the non-cancerous tissues (P<0.05). The positivity rates of PCNA expression in the gastric mucosal cells of MNNG group were significantly higher than those in the other 4 groups. The mean serum folic acid concentration of the rats was significantly higher in MNNG + folic acid group (193.7 ng/ml±60.7 ng/ml) than those in the control group (84.2 ng/ml±25.3 ng/ml) and MNNG group (72.3 ng/ml±16.7 ng/ml) (P<0.05). Conclusions: Our results indicate that both low and high dose rofecoxib and folic acid interfere with gastric carcinogenesis induced by MNNG in Wistar rats, the suppression of gastric cell proliferation may play a crucial role in the chemoprevention of gastric cancer by rofecoxib and folic acid.

18944383607	Effects of bile reflux on gastric mucosal lesions in patients with dyspepsia or chronic gastritis	Aim: To investigate the influences of bile reflux on profiles of gastric mucosal lesions in patients with dyspepsia or chronic gastritis. Methods: A total of 49 patients diagnosed with dyspepsia and chronic gastritis underwent 24-h ambulatory and simultaneous monitoring of intragastric bilirubin absorbance and pH values, and then they were divided into bile reflux positive group and bile reflux negative group. Severity of pathological changes in gastric mucosa including active inflammation, chronic inflammation, intestinal metaplasia, atrophy and dysplasia as well as Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection at the corpus, incisura and antrum were determined respectively according to update Sydney system criteria. The profiles of gastric mucosal lesions in the two groups were compared, and correlations between time-percentage of gastric bilirubin absorbance >0.14 and severity of gastric mucosal lesions as well as time-percentage of gastric pH >4 were analyzed respectively. Results: Thirty-eight patients (21 men and 17 women, mean age 44.2 years, range 25-61 years) were found existing with bile reflux (gastric bilirubin absorbance >0.14) and 11 patients (7 men and 4 women, mean age 46.2 years, range 29-54 years) were bile reflux negative. In dyspepsia patients with bile reflux, the mucosal lesions such as active inflammation, chronic inflammation, intestinal metaplasia, atrophy or H pylori infection in the whole stomach, especially in the corpus and incisura, were significantly more severe than those in dyspepsia patients without bile reflux. Moreover, the bile reflux time was well correlated with the severity of pathological changes of gastric mucosa as well as H pylori colonization in the near-end stomach, especially in the corpus region. No relevance was found between the time of bile reflux and pH >4 in gastric cavity. Conclusion: Bile reflux contributes a lot to mucosal lesions in the whole stomach, may facilitate H pylori colonization in the corpus region, and has no influence on acid-exposing status of gastric mucosa in patients with dyspepsia or chronic gastritis. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

0029965028	Studies on the hypomethylation of c-myc, c-Ha-ras oncogenes and histopathological changes in human gastric carcinoma	In order to study the status of DNA methylation of specific oncogenes and the relationship between them and the pathological changes in gastric carcinoma, we analysed the methylated status of c-myc, c-Ha-ras oncogenes by Southern blot hybridization. Genomic DNA from cancerous, paracancerous and non-cancerous areas of surgically resected specimens were examined in 22 cases of advanced human gastric carcinoma. Specimens were digested by the restriction endonucleases MspI/HpaII, which are able to cleave between methylated and non-methylated cytosine at their nucleotide recognition site the DNA 5'-CCGG sequence, and were hybridized with c-myc, c-Ha-ras oncogene probes. Moreover, the corresponding pathological changes in gastric carcinoma were observed. The results showed that c-myc, c-Ha-ras oncogenes from cancerous (10/22, 5/10) and paracancerous areas (13/22, 4/10) were hypomethylated and that there was no significant relationship between them and the histopathological changes.

24744463101	Helicobacter pylori "test-and-treat" strategy is not suitable for the management of patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia in Shanghai	Objective. The safety of Helicobacter pylori "test-and-treat" and "test-and-endoscopy" strategies for the management of young patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia has not been evaluated in Shanghai. Material and methods. A total of 14,101 consecutive patients with dyspepsia receiving endoscopy in our hospital from October 2002 to December 2003 were retrospectively studied. The detection rates of esophageal or gastroduodenal malignancies and alarm symptoms were investigated, and H. pylori status was assessed. Results. A total of 202 (1.4%) gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies were found, including 162 cases (1.15%) of gastric cancer, 4 of gastric lymphoma, 35 (0.25%) of esophageal cancer and 1 case of duodenal cancer. Among those patients with GI malignancies, 99 (49.0%) were infected with H. pylori and 108 (53.5%) presented with alarm symptoms. Eighteen patients (0.46%, 18/3952) under 45 years of age were diagnosed as having gastric cancer. Of these patients, 5 (27.8%) presented with alarm symptoms and 13 (72.2%) were infected with H. pylori. If the H. pylori "test-and-treat" strategy were used in dyspeptic patients under the age of 45 years without alarm symptoms in the Shanghai region, then 13 cases (72.2%) of gastric cancer would be missed. If the H. pylori "test-and-endoscopy" strategy were applied, then 3 cases (16.7%) of gastric cancer would be missed. Conclusions. H. pylori "test-and-treat" and "test-and-endoscopy" strategies are both not suitable for the management of patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia in Shanghai. For most Shanghai dyspeptic patients, prompt endoscopy should be recommended as the first-line initial management option. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

29944434288	Effects of gastric distention on the expression of Fos protein and calcitonin gene-related peptide in brain, spinal cord and myenteric nerve plexus of rats	Background: Functional dyspepsia is a common disease. More evidences show that it is associated with visceral hypersensitivity. Aims: To detect the expression of Fos protein and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in brain, spinal cord and myenteric nerve plexus of rats after nocuity gastric dilatation, and to determine the pathway and mode of transmission of afferent visceral stimuli. Methods: Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into three groups: experimental group (n=12), surgery control group (n=6) and normal control group (n=6). A balloon was implanted into the rats' stomach in experimental group and surgery control group. Forty-eight hours later, the rats in experimental group received repeated balloon dilatation [80 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa)] lasting for 2 hours. Then all rats were sacrificed, and the brain, thoracic spinal cord and gastric antrum were isolated and dissected. The expression of Fos protein and CGRP were examined by immunohistochemistry. Results: In the experimental group, the Fos protein expression in amygdaloid complex, medulla oblongata and thoracic spinal cord was significantly increased as compared with that in other two control groups (P<0.01). Similarly, the expression of CGRP in medulla oblongata and thoracic spinal cord was also significantly increased as compared with that in other two control groups (P<0.05 and P<0.01). However no difference was found in Fos protein expression in myenteric nerve plexus of the three groups. Fos protein expression was significantly correlated with CGRP expression in medulla oblongata and thoracic cord, respectively (r

29944444867	Clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease: An analysis of 52 cases	Background: Crohn's disease (CD) is a segmental transmural inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. So far the cause remains unclear, the clinical manifestations are diverse and the histological changes showed no distinctive features, which is easily misdiagnosed. Aims: To analyze the clinical data of inpatients diagnosed as CD for improving the accuracy of early diagnosis. Methods: Fifty-two inpatients of Renji Hospital diagnosed as CD from 1993 to 2003 were enrolled. Their clinical manifestation, diagnostic methods, time of final diagnosis, therapeutics and prognosis were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The most common gastrointestinal symptoms of these patients were abdominal pain (80.8%) and diarrhea (57.7%), gastrointestinal bleeding was also frequent (44.2%). Small bowel (53.8%) and colon (26.9%) were the major sites involved. Colonoscopy was the main diagnostic method for distal ileal and colorectal lesions, followed by barium studies. Enteroclysis/gastrointestinal barium meal being always utilized for small bowel lesions, capsule endoscopy, double-balloon push enteroscopy and magnetic resonance enteroclysis could also be used. Non-caseating granulomas could be frequently observed if this "micro" lesion had been searched for. Among the 52 patients at the time of admission, only 40.4% were precisely diagnosed, the other 59.6% were presumably diagnosed. No decrement of misdiagnosis rate or time of final diagnosis was found between the years before and after 2001. Conclusions: The diversity and non-specificity of the clinical manifestations of CD may cause delayed diagnosis. Colonoscopy is the key method for diagnosis of CD. Early diagnosis of small bowel CD can be made by enteroclysis/gastrointestinal barium meal, capsule endoscopy or double-balloon push enteroscopy. For those suspicious cases, treatment should also be given and the diagnosis can be re-assessed.

33745607589	Chemopreventive effects of rofecoxib and folic acid on gastric carcinogenesis induced by N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in rats	Objectives: Epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are chemopreventive agents of gastrointestinal cancers, but few studies on gastric cancer have been carried out. A decrease in folic acid supplement and subsequent DNA hypomethylation are related to gastrointestinal cancers, and it has been shown that high-dose folic acid may interfere with gastric carcinogenesis in dogs. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of rofecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, and folic acid on the chemoprevention of gastric cancer induced by N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in Wistar rats, and to evaluate the cell proliferation of gastric mucosa in different experimental groups. Methods: Eighty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (16 rats in each group). In the control group, the rats were given pure water and basal diet. In the MNNG group, the rats received MNNG in drinking water (100 mg/L) and basal diet. In the MNNG + low-dose rofecoxib group, the rats were given MNNG and rofecoxib 5 mg/kg per day with basal diet. In the MNNG + high-dose rofecoxib group, the rats were given MNNG and rofecoxib 15 mg/kg per day with basal diet. In the MNNG + folic acid group, the rats were given MNNG and folic acid 5 mg/kg per day with basal diet. The experiment was terminated at 50 weeks, and all rats were killed. Blood samples of 3 mL were obtained for measurement of serum folic acid concentrations in the control group, the MNNG group and the MNNG + folic acid group by using chemiluminescent method. The stomach was removed from all rats for histopathological examination and immunohistochemical study. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in gastric epithelial cells was also determined. Results: In the MNNG group, five of 11 rats (45.5%) developed gastric cancer, while in all other four groups no gastric cancer was found (P < 0.05). The positivity rate of PCNA expression in the cancerous tissues was significantly higher than that in the non-cancerous tissues (80.0% vs 14.1%, P < 0.05). The positivity rate of PCNA expression in the gastric mucosal cells of the MNNG group was significantly higher than that in the other four groups. The mean serum folic acid concentration of rats was significantly higher in the MNNG + folic acid group (193.70 ± 60.73 ng/mL) than those in the control group (84.21 ± 25.26 ng/mL) and the MNNG group (72.27 ± 16.70 ng/mL, P < 0.05). It was shown that both low- and high-dose rofecoxib as well as folic acid interfered with the development of gastric cancer induced by MNNG in Wistar rats. Conclusions: The results indicate that rofecoxib as well as folic acid interferes with gastric carcinogenesis induced by MNNG in Wistar rats, and the suppression of gastric cell proliferation may play a crucial role in the chemoprevention of gastric cancer by rofecoxib and folic acid. The higher serum folic acid concentration of rats may play an important role in the prevention of gastric cancer. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

33747055323	Correlation of C-reactive protein with activity of Crohn's disease	Objective: To investigate the role of C-reactive protein (CRP) in evaluating activity of Crohn's disease (CD). Methods: 85 patients with Crohn's disease, 59 males and 26 females, aged 15 - 69, underwent laboratory examination of CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), albumin, and hemoglobin. Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) was calculated. Endoscopy was conducted to collect samples of colon mucosa to undergo HE staining for pathological examination and immunohistochemical staining for the expression of nuclear factor-κB p65 (NF-κB p65). Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the correlation of CRP with ESR, CDAI, endoscopic activity, pathologic activity, hypoalbuminemia, and anemia. The effects of lesion location, clinical severity, and drug were considered. Results: CRP elevation was correlated with ESR, but not correlated with CDAI, endoscopic activity, pathologic activity, hypoalbuminemia, and anemia. CRP was significantly elevated in active CD (P <0.01), especially in severe or colonic CD (P < 0.05). CRP rapidly decreased when the CD activity was effectively controlled by drugs (P < 0.01), and was reelevated when disease recurred (P > 0.05). Serum CRP elevation was paralleled with the NF-κB p65 level (P = 1.0). Conclusion: More suitable for refection of the activity of moderate or severe colonic CD, CRP can reflect the effects of drugs in the early stage of CD. The serum CRP elevation is consistent with the NF-κB p65 expression in colon tissues.

33750157005	Quality of ulcer healing in patients with active gastric ulcer treated with combined hydrotalcite and omeprazole	Background: Peptic ulcers healing can be accelerated by the use of proton-pump inhibitors and eradication of H. pylori infection, however, sometimes its relapse remains a problem. The quality of ulcer histologic healing plays an important role in ulcer recurrence. Aims: To evaluate the quality of gastric ulcer histologic healing under Omeprazole treatment alone or in combination with hydrotalcite. Methods: Gastric biopsy specimens were obtained from 88 patients with active gastric ulcer and positive H. pylori infection. All patients were randomized into study group and control group. At the 1st week, all patients were given H. pylori eradication regimen, and the study group was given additional hydrotalcite. From the 2nd to 6th week, the study group received Omeprazole and hydrotalcite, and the controlled group received Omeprazole only. From the 7th to 8th week, the study group was given hydrotalcite, and the controlled group without any drug. After the eight-week treatment, two to four biopsy specimens were obtained from the same area near the ulcer as before. The histological changes of gastric mucosa were re-evaluated in both groups after treatment. The gastric mucosal recovery was noted, in paticular, the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration and morphological structure of mucosa. Results: Better mucosal recovery on the density and morphology of glandular structures were observed in the study group (P=0.0351 and P=0.0176, respectively) at the end of eight weeks. Conclusions: The combined therapy of hydrotalcite and Omeprazole can improve the histologic quality of ulcer healing, in particular the restoration of gastric mucosa in patients with active gastric ulcer.

33750168337	C-reactive protein reflects activity of inflammatory bowel disease	Background: Clinical activity, C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are routinely used to evaluate the activity of inflammatory bowel diseases, but they are frequently in consistent. Aims: To appraise the role of CRP in evaluating activity of inflammatory bowel diseases. Methods: Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the correlation of CRP with erythrocyte sedimentation rate, clinical activity, endoscopic activity, pathologic activity, hypoalbuminemia, anemia and peripheral white blood cells count in 80 Crohn's disease (CD) and 70 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. The effects of degree of disease severity, site of lesions and drug treatment on the illness were analyzed. Results: CRP elevation was associated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate in CD and erythrocyte sedimentation rate or peripheral white blood cells count in UC. CRP was significantly elevated in active CD and UC (NO.01), especially in severe colonic CD and severe UC (P<0.05). CRP rapidly decreased when clinical activity was effectively controlled by drugs (P<0.01), while re-elevated when the disease recurred (P>0.05). Conclusions: CRP elevation better reflects the activity of severe colonic CD and severe UC, but the decrease of CRP may indicate rapidly the effectiveness of drug treatment.

33846975802	Expression of Ki-67 and its significance in Barrett's esohagus, severe reflux esophagitis and esophageal adenocarcinoma	Background: Barrett's esophagus is a precancerous lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Ki-67 is an antigen which can be used to estimate the process of cell proliferation and may play an important role in the course of development of cancer. Aims: To investigate the expression of Ki-67 and its significance in Barrett's esophagus, severe reflux esophagitis and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Methods: Expression of Ki-67 was determined in 59 cases of Barrett's esophagus, 5 severe reflux esophagitis, 5 esophageal adenocarcinoma, and 10 normal esophageal epithelium by immunohistochemical staining (SP method). Results: Expression of Ki-67 was positive in 80.0% of severe reflux esophagitis and 76.3% of Barrett's esophagus, significantly higher than that in normal esophageal epithelium (20.0%, P<0.05). In esophageal adenocarcinoma, the expression of Ki-67 was positive in 100% of cases. The expression of Ki-67 increased with increase of the degree of intestinal metaplasia in Barrett's esophagus (P<0.05), however, its expression was not significantly different between different length (short-segment and long-segment), types of Barrett's esophagus (circumferential, tongue and island types) and different degrees of dysplasia (low or moderate degree) (P>0.05). Conclusions: Expression of Ki-67 increases in severe reflux esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus, and may play an important role in the course of development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.

34147195150	Protective effects of tripterine on rat colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid	Background: The therapeutic effects of conventional drugs on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)) are not very satisfactory. To seek novel and effective drug is always the hotspot in the study of IBD. Aims: To investigate the protective effects of tripterine on trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats and to explore its possible mechanisms. Methods: Rat colitis model was induced by TNBS enema. Then the rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: normal control group, model group, adjuvant solution control group, low- (0.5 mg/kg per day) and high-dose (1 mg/kg per day) tripterine-treated groups. The severity of colitis was evaluated by macroscopic and microscopic score. The expression of nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65 in the colonic tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the expressions of interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α mRNA were assessed by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Remarkable efficacy of both low- and high-dose of tripterine was observed in TNBS-induced colitis with decrement of macroscopic and microscopic score and suppression of NF-κB p65, IL-β mRNA and TNF-α mRNA expressions in the colonic tissues. Conclusions: Tripterine has noticeable protective effects on TNBS-induced colitis in rats, suppression of proinflammatory cytokines may be one of its main mechanisms.

34547765868	Duodenal gastric metaplasia and Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with diffuse nodular duodenitis	Whether the regression of gastric metaplasia in the duodenum can be achieved after eradication of Helicobacter pylori is not clear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between H. pylori infection and gastric metaplasia in patients with endoscopic diffuse nodular duodenitis. Eighty-six patients with endoscopically confirmed nodular duodenitis and 40 control patients with normal duodenal appearance were investigated. The H. pylori-positive patients with duodenitis received anti H. pylori triple therapy (20 mg omeprazole plus 250 mg clarithromychi and 400 mg metronidazole, all twice daily) for one week. A control endoscopy was performed 6 months after H. pylori treatment The H. pylori-negative patients with duodenitis received 20 mg omeprazole once daily for 6 months and a control endoscopy was performed 2 weeks after treatment. The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 58.1%, and the prevalence of gastric metaplasia was 57.0%. Seventy-six patients underwent endoscopy again. No influence on the endoscopic appearance of nodular duodenitis was found after eradication of H. pylori or acid suppression therapy. However, gastric metaplasia significantly decreased and complete regression was achieved in 15/28 patients (53.6%) 6 months after eradication of H. pylori, accompanied by significant improvement of other histological alterations. Only mild chronic inflammation, but not gastric metaplasia, was found in the control group, none with H. pylori infection in the duodenal bulb. Therefore, H. pylori infection is related to the extent of gastric metaplasia in the duodenum, but not to the presence of diffuse nodular duodenitis. © 2007 Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research.

34547562987	Experimental change on dopaminergic neurons in striatum of Parkinson disease rats	Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective and progressive demise of dopamine-containing neurons in the midbrain. In this study, we observe the expression of c-Jun in the striatum of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesions after apomorphine (APO) intraperitoneal injection (ip) in substantia nigra compacta (SNc), and to study the mechanism of the rotations behavior. Design: The 6-OHDA was unilaterally injected into rat right SNC. The APO- induced abnormal rotations were investigated on the 1st, 4th 7th, 14th 21st days after lesion, respectively. Meanwhile dopaminergic degeneration and c-Jun expression were observed with microscope. Nissl's body staining and immunohistochemical method (ABC) were employed to study the changes of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and c-Jun in DA neurons. Results: We found that the number of dopaminergic neurons decreased gradually in the lesioned site and those neurons' electron-microscopic structure was severe damaged. There were over 75% of dopaminergic neurons lost, contralateral rotations over 7 turns per minute and c-Jun expressing in the ipsilateral striatum. Conclusion: Dopaminergic neurons deletion may be linked to upregulation of c-Jun.

35248838246	Rebamipide improves the histologic quality of gastric ulcer healing in humans	Background: Peptic ulcers healing can be accelerated by the use of proton pump inhibitors and eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, however, sometimes its relapse remains a problem. The quality of ulcer histologic healing plays an important role in ulcer recurrence. Aims: To evaluate the quality of ulcer histologic healing by treatment of rebamipide combined with famotidine or omeprazole alone in patients with active gastric ulcer. Methods: Gastric biopsy specimens were obtained from 110 patients with active gastric ulcer and H. pylori infection. The patients were divided randomly into the study group and the control group. In the study group, the patients received rebamipide combined with famotidine for 6 weeks and in the control group only omeprazole was given to the patients for six weeks. After treatment, 2-4 biopsy specimens were obtained from the area nearby the previous ulcer. The histologic changes of gastric mucosa were re-evaluated in both groups after treatment. The gastric mucosal recovery was evaluated, in particular, the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration, morphological structure of mucosa and intraepithelial mucin. Results: After 6 weeks treatment, the improvement of intraepithelial mucin content in the study group was better than that in the control group (P=0.0039), and the glandular density increased than that before treatment (P=0.0485). Conclusions: Whether eradication of H. pylori infection or not, the combined therapy of rebamipide and famotidine can improve the histologic quality of ulcer healing, especially the restoration of gastric intraepithelial mucin content and glandular density in patients with active gastric ulcer.

0032808978	Interobserver variation in the histopathological scoring of Helicobacter pylori related gastritis	Aim - To test the reproducibility between two histopathologists of features of Helicobacter pylori gastritis, using the updated Sydney classification. Methods - 290 dyspeptic Dutch patients with biopsy proven H pylori infection were enrolled in the study. Gastric antral mucosal biopsy specimens were analysed before and after H pylori eradication treatment. The biopsies were scored semiquantitatively by two histopathologists, according to the updated Sydney classification system. Variables analysed included the density of H pylori infection, the degree of chronic inflammation, inflammatory activity, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and surface epithelial damage. Before grading biopsy specimens, both pathologists reached a consensus on the scoring of gastritis through interactive sessions using a multiheaded microscope. Subsequently all biopsy specimens were graded. Interobserver variability was also analysed using weighted κ scores. Results - For interobserver agreement on scoring the various gastritis features a high degree of reproducibility was reached overall. Agreement on grading of atrophy was the lowest; however, moderate to good reproducibility was achieved, with weighted κ values of 0.49 in the pretreatment biopsies and 0.52 in the post-treatment biopsies. Disagreement was most common in biopsy specimens with lesser degrees of atrophy. A high degree of agreement was obtained for intestinal metaplasia, with weighted κ values of 0.72 in the pretreatment biopsies and 0.73 in the post-treatment biopsies. The best agreement was reached in the assessment of the density of H pylori both before and after H pylori eradication treatment, with excellent weighted κ values of 0.76 and 0.95, respectively. The grade of reproducibility of inflammatory activity, superficial epithelial damage, and chronic inflammation was high, with weighted κ values varying from 0.60 to 0.76 and 0.62 to 0.83 before and after eradication, respectively. Conclusions - Reproducibility of grading H pylori related gastritis is high using the updated Sydney system. Despite the novel criteria for scoring atrophy, there was imperfect agreement on this feature between two independent histopathologists.

Methods: Resistin gene was cloned into vector pEGFP-C1 to construct pEG/ Resi plasmid; the latter was then used to transfect ECV304 cells via liposome. TNF-α(20 μg/L) was added to the system 6 h after transfection. RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of resistin and ICAM-1 mRNA in the cells 18, 30, 42 and 54 h after transfection; meanwhile, the resistin protein levels were determined by Western blotting analysis. ICAM-1 protein levels in the supernatants of ECV304 cells were determined by ELISA. Results: Restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing demonstrated that the recombinant plasmid was successfully constructed and was expressed in ECV304. ICAM-1 levels in resistin-transfected group were consistently higher than that in the non-transfected group in the presence of TNF-α. ICAM-1 mRNA and protein expression in the transfected-group was significantly higher than that in the non-transfected group during the peak periods (30 and 42 h) of resistin expression (P<0.05); ICAM-1 mRNA and protein expression increased with the increase of resistin gene expression. Conclusion: Resistin gene can enhance TNF-α-induced expression of ICAM-1 in ECV304 cells.

33244487253	Investigation on the relationship between duodenal ulcer and atrophic gastritis	Background: There is accumulating evidence that gastric ulcer (GU) is positively associated and duodenal ulcer (DU) is negatively associated with the risk of developing stomach cancer. Aims: To investigate the relationship between duodenal ulcer and atrophic gastritis. Methods: The biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa of antrum, junction of antrum and corpus, and corpus in patients with DU, GU, complex ulcer (CU) and antral mucosa in patients with chronic gastritis (CG) were examined by histological stains; and then the incidence and degree of atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, chronic inflammatory activity and Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) infection were statistically analyzed. Results: The incidence rates of gastric mucosal atrophy in antrum, junction and corpus of duodenal ulcer patients were 54.2%,9.5% and 12.4%, respectively, whilst those of intestinal metaplasia were 18.9%, 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively. The incidence rate of intestinal metaplasia of antral mucosa in DU patients was lower than that of GU, CU and CG patients. All patients with peptic ulcer and CG presented chronic inflammation in antral mucosa. The incidence rates of chronic inflammation of corpus in DU, GU and CU patients also attained a very high level. The incidence rates of inflammatory activity of gastritis in DU,GU and CU patients were predominatly in the antrum, and were higher than that in chronic gastritis (P<0.05). The incidence rate of type I intestinal metaplasia of antral mucosa in DU,GU and CU patients was 68.1%, 43.8% and 45.0%, respectively, whereas the incidence rate of type III intestinal metaplasia of these patients was 6.4%, 25.0% and 20.0%, respectively. Conclusions: Focal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia can develop in the antral mucosa of DU patients. The incidence rate of intestinal metaplasia in the antral mucosa and type III intestinal metaplasia are lowest in DU patients, which might account for the reason why DU patients have a lower risk for developing gastric cancer.

33644908492	Gastric distention enhances FOS and calcitonin gene-related peptide expression in the spinal cord and brain of rats	Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the pathway and mode of transmission of visceral stimuli by investigating the distribution of the FOS and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) proteins in the central nervous system. Methods: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: study group (n = 12), sham control group (n = 6), and normal control group (n = 6). A balloon was implanted into the stomach of the rats in the study and sham control groups. After 48 h, the rats in the study group had the stomach distended (80 mmHg) for 2 h, after which they were killed and the antrum, thoracic spinal cord and brain were isolated or dissected. The expression of Fos and CGRP in these tissues was detected immunohistochemically. Results: FOS expression in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, dorsal nucleus of the vagal nerve, nucleus of the solitary tract in the study rats was significantly higher than in the sham and normal controls. However, no difference was found between the three groups in FOS expression in the myenteric plexus. Similarly, gastric distention enhanced CGRP expression significantly in the spinal cord and medulla oblongata and correlated closely with FOS expression in these two areas. Conclusions: Gastric distention can activate the limbic system, and CGRP plays an important role in the input of visceral stimuli. © 2006 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

32244435771	Effects of Helicobacter pylori infection on neural expression of stomach and spinal cord: An experiment with mice	Objective: To investigate the effects of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection on neural expression in stomach and spinal cord, and to investigate the mechanism of functional dyspepsia after Hp infection. Methods: Thirty-five female C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups: Group A (acute infection group, undergoing intragastric gavage of Hp suspension every other day for 3 times and then observed for 2 weeks, 15 mice), Group B (chronic infection group, undergoing intragastric gavage of Hp suspension every other day for 3 times and then observed for 2 weeks, 15 mice) and control group (undergoing intragastric gavage of normal saline every other day for 3 times and then observed for 2 weeks, 5 mice). After the observation the mice were killed and their stomachs were taken out to undergo gastric histology and bacterial colonization by HE staining and Warthin-Starry staining respectively. Their spinal cords of thoracic and lumbar segments were taken out too. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of Fos, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the stomach and spinal cord. Results: Three mice died 12 weeks after Hp infection. The rate of Hp colonization, mainly localized in pyloric gland region, was greater in Group B than in Group A, and was 0 in the control group. The severity of inflammation as shown by mononuclear cell infiltration, and activity of inflammation as shown by polymorphonuclear cell infiltration, in the pyloric gland region, proventriculus-glandular stomach region, and corpus gland region were more pronounced in Groups A and B, especially in Group B, than in the control group. The expression values of Fos, VIP, and CGRP in the stomach of Group A were 3.1 ± 1.4, 4.5 ± 1.8, and 2.4 ± 0.8 respectively, all not significantly different from those of Group B (3.1 ± 1.3, 3.5 ± 1.6, and 2.2 ± 0.8, all P >0.05). The expression values of Fos, VIP, and CGRP in the spinal cord of Group A were 3.8 ± 1.2, 3.2 ± 1.5, and 2.2 ± 0.6, all not significantly different from those of Group B (3.4 ± 0.7, 2.6 ± 1.2, and 2.5 ± 1.1, all P > 0.05 for all). However, the neural expression values in both acute and chronic infection groups were significantly higher than those in the control group (2.4 ± 0.9, 1.6 ± 0.9, and 1.2 ± 0.8 in stomach; and 2.0 ± 1.6, 1.2 ± 1.1, and 1.2 ± 1.1 in spinal cord, P < 0.05 for all). Conclusion: Hp infection, both acute and chronic, induces gastric histological changes such as inflammation and activity, and enhances the Fos, VIP, and CGRP expression in stomach and spinal cord, which can be a basis for symptom generation in dyspeptic patients with Hp infection.

77954485868	Isoliquiritigen enhances antitumour activity of cyclophosphamid	Previous reports reveal that Isoliquiritigen(ISL), a licorice flavonoid, possesses various antitumour properties, cyclophosphamide, an alkylating agent, has various genotoxic and carcinogenic effects, and to be involved in some secondary neoplasmas. However, it is still used extensively as an antitumour agent and immunosuppressant in the clinic. In order to find out whether isoliquiritigen could enhance antitumour activity, as well as decrease genotoxic effects of cyclophosphamide or not, the antitumour activity and genotoxic effect of oral intake of ISL combined with intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide was investigated. Mice bearing mouse sarcoma S180 cells and cervical cancer U14 cells were respectively used to estimate the antitumour activity in vivo. The clastogenic activity in bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes was assayed by frequency of micronucleus. The DNA damage in peripheral white blood cells was assayed by single cell gel electrophoresis. The results indicated that oral administration of ISL (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg body weight) alone has no obvious antitumour activity and genotoxic effect in mice, while ISL synergistically enhanced the antitumour activity of cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg body weight) in a dose-dependent manner. in addition, ISL can decrease the micronucleus formation in polychromatic erythrocytes and DNA strand breaks in white blood cells in a dose-dependent way. Our results suggested that ISL is able to enhance the antitumour activity and decrease the genotoxic effect of cyclophosphamide. © 2010 IEEE.

77954753857	Expression of polycomb protein EZH2 in multi-stage tissues of gastric carcinogenesis	OBJECTIVE: To study the role and significance of the polycomb group (PcG) protein EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) in the multi-step process of intestinal-type gastric carcinogenesis. METHODS: Gastric specimens were obtained from 142 patients with gastric disease, including 34 with chronic non-atrophic gastritis (NCAG), 33 chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) with intestinal metaplasia (IM), 40 CAG with dysplasia (DYS) and 35 with intestinal-type gastric carcinomas (GC), and 32 Helicobacter pylori-negative controls. The EZH2 protein was stained by the immunohistochemical method and was expressed as the intensity and percentage of the total number of epithelial cells. The chronic gastritis and the grading of dysplasia were classified according to Chinese National Consensus on chronic gastritis and the Padova international classification. RESULTS: The EZH2 protein levels in the specimens of normal gastric tissue, NCAG, CAG with IM, DYS and intestinal-type GC were gradually increased (P < 0.05), but statistical significance was not found between the groups of DYS and GC. CONCLUSION: PcG protein EZH2 plays an important role in the multi-step process of intestinal-type gastric carcinogenesis. © 2010 The Authors.

45749144694	Influence of fluctuant hyperglycemia on the maturation and immune function of dendritic cells	Aim: Diabetes mellitus and the relative macroangiopathy are one kind of autoimmune-mediated inflammatory reaction. Recent studies have shown that the diabetes complications have close relation with blood glucose fluctuations. This study was to investigate the influence of fluctuant hyperglycemia and stable hyperglycemia on the maturation and immune function of dendritic cells. Methods: Between December 2006 and September 2007 the experiments were performed at the Center Laboratory of First People's Hospital. Twelve human peripheral bloods obtained from healthy volunteers aged raging from 27 to 35 years in Cancer Center of Sun Yet-sen University were all informed consent and approved by Hospital's Ethics Committee. 1 Dendritic cells induced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers were cultured and propagated in vitro in media with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) and recombinant human interleukin (rhIL)-4, and then were cocultured with three different culture media containing normal glucose (5.5 mmol/L glucose), stable hyperglycemia (20 mmol/L glucose) and fluctuant hyperglycemia (5.5 mmol/L and 20 mmol/L alternative action) for 48 hours. 2 Flow cytometry was used to investigate the immunophenotype expression of dendritic cells. Allergenic mixed T lymphocytes reaction was used to observe the influence on leukomonocyte proliferation. Supernatants' cytokine IL-12 concentration were detected by enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: 1 Compared to the normal glucose group, the expression of CDI α, CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR were up-regulated in the other two groups (P < 0.01). The effects on dendritic cells were higher in the fluctuant hyperglycemia group than in the stable hyperglycemia group (P < 0.05). 2 Compared to the normal glucose group, the proliferations of T cell were increased in the fluctuant hyperglycemia group and stable hyperglycemia group (P < 0.01). The proliferation was stronger with the increase in cell number. The proliferation was higher in the fluctuant hyperglycemia group than in the stable hyperglycemia group (P < 0.05). 3 The effects of the fluctuant hyperglycemia group (5.5 mmol/L and 20 mmol/L alternative action) on the secretion of IL-12 were more significant than in the stable hyperglycemia group (20 mmol/L glucose) (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Stable hyperglycemia and fluctuant hyperglycemia can promote the maturation and immune function of dendritic cells. Fluctuant hyperglycemia has more obvious effect on these functions.

46449115224	The expression and clinical significance of DNA methyltransferase proteins in human gastric cancer	This study investigates the varied expression of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) proteins in gastric cancer (GC) and their relationship with the biological behavior of the tissues. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of the 3 DNMTs in gastric tissues. We discovered that the positive rates of DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b expression in GC tissues were 81.6%, 81.6%, and 68.4%, respectively, and they were significantly higher than those of both para-cancerous (39.5%, 50%, and 44.7%) and normal tissues (10.5%, 10.5%, and 7.9%). DNMT1 was well distributed in the cytoplasm and nuclei of tumor cells or glands, while DNMT3a and 3b were well distributed only in the cytoplasm, as shown by staining a dark brown color. A significant correlation between the DNMT1 and DNMT3a proteins (P < 0.01), a low correlation between DNMT3a and DNMT3b (P < 0.05), and no correlation between DNMT1 and DNMT3b (P > 0.05) were observed. DNMT1 protein expression exhibited no correlation with age, lymphnode metastasis, and also tumor differentiation, but it may have had a correlation with gender. The DNMT3 family was not associated with these factors. Therefore, DNMT overexpression is involved in gastric tumorigenesis, but there is no correlation between the DNMTs and the biological behaviors of tissues. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

52049117187	Effect of total flavonoids of chrysanthemum indicum on the apoptosis of synoviocytes in joint of adjuvant arthritis rats	Chrysanthemum is a traditional Chinese medicine used in China to treat inflammatory diseases. The total flavonoids Chrysanthemum indicum (TFC) were extracted from the dried bud of Chrysanthemum indicum. Our previous study had demonstrated that TFC was a new class of effective anti-inflammation, analgesia and immunoloregulation agents. In this study, we established an adjuvant arthritis (AA) model by injection of Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) to investigate the effect of TFC on the apoptosis of synoviocytes in AA Rats. Synoviocytes isolated from knee joint of rats were treated with different doses of TFC in vitro. Synoviocytes proliferation was measured by MTT assay, and DNA fragmentations were evaluated on agarose gel electrophoresis. The levels of caspase-3 cleaved fragments were analyzed by Western blot. The annexin V stain assay was used to explore the inhibition of caspase-3 on the amelioration of synoviocytes apoptosis. The results showed that TFC inhibited the proliferation of synoviocytes. Electrophoresis showed higher ladders of DNA bands in the TFC group. Cleaved fragments of caspase-3 were increased significantly. Furthermore, the apoptotic synoviocytes were markedly decreased by the caspase-3 specific inhibitor. These results suggest that TFC could induce synoviocytes apoptosis and suppress proliferation of synoviocytes in adjuvant-induced arthritis rats. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.

55149116997	Role of bile reflux and Helicobacter pylori infection on inflammation of gastric remnant after distal gastrectomy	Objectives: The influence of the main pathogenic factors on remnant gastritis is still to be evaluated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of bile reflux and Helicobacter pylori infection on endoscopic inflammation and histological changes of gastric remnant after distal gastrectomy. Methods: A total of 281 patients with a more than 1-year history of distal gastrectomy were retrospectively involved after excluding those with tumors and ulcers on endoscopy. The severity of endoscopic remnant gastritis and bile reflux were recorded during the endoscopy. The histological changes including chronic inflammation, activity, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori were evaluated independently. Results: An endoscopic inflammation of remnant gastric mucosae was found in 81.1% (228/281) of the patients. The prevalence of H. pylori infection and bile reflux in patients with endoscopic remnant gastritis was more common than in those without gastritis (21.5% vs 0%, 88.6% vs 24.5%, P < 0.0001). The score of histological chronic inflammation was significantly higher in patients with bile reflux than in those without obvious bile reflux (1.65 vs 1.45, P = 0.02). Chronic inflammation (1.82 vs 1.57), activity (0.78 vs 0.34), atrophy (0.67 vs 0.41) and intestinal metaplasia (0.67 vs 0.27) in H. pylori-positive patients were all significantly more severe than in H. pylori-negative patients. Conclusion: Bile reflux and H. pylori infection exacerbates the severity of endoscopic remnant gastritis and chronic histological inflammation. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

56649089880	The Helicobacter pylori duodenal ulcer promoting gene, dupA in China	Background: The prevalence of H. pylori is as high as 60-70% in Chinese population. Although duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer are both caused by H. pylori, they are at opposite ends of the spectrum and as such are considered mutually exclusive. Duodenal ulcer promoting (dupA) gene was reported to be associated with duodenal ulcer development. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of dupA gene of Helicobacter pylori in patients with various gastroduodenal diseases and to explore the association between the gene and other virulence factors. Methods: H. pylori were isolated from gastric biopsies of patients with chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer (DU), gastric ulcer (GU), or non-cardia gastric carcinoma. The dupA, cagA, vacA, iceA and babA2 genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction. Histological features of gastric mucosal biopsy specimens were graded based on the scoring system proposed by the updated Sydney system. IL-1β polymorphism was investigated using restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results: Isolates from 360 patients including 133 with chronic gastritis, 101 with DU, 47 with GU, and 79 with non-cardia gastric carcinoma were examined. The dupA gene was detected in 35.3% (127/360) and the prevalence DU patients was significantly greater than that in gastric cancer or GU patients (45.5% vs. 24.1% and 23.4%, P < 0.05). Patients infected with dupA-positive strains had higher scores for chronic inflammation compared to those with dupA-negative strains (2.36 vs. 2.24, p = 0.058). The presence of dupA was not associated with the cagA, vacA, iceA and babA 2 genotypes or with IL-1β polymorphisms. Conclusion: In China the prevalence of dupA gene was highest in DU and inversely related to GU and gastric cancer. © 2008 Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

60349100370	Effect of total flavonoids of Chrysanthemum indicum on the apoptosis of adjuvant arthritis rat synoviocytes and the expression of caspase-3	Objective: To study the effect of the extract of total flavonoids of Chrysanthemum indicum (TFC) on adjuvant arthritis(AA) synoviocytes. Methods: Totally 0.1ml of the complete Freund's adjuvant was subcutaneously injected into the right hind feet pads of 20 SD rats. 24 days after immunity svnoviocytes in the knee joint were treated with TFC. Cell morphology was examined with electron microscopy. Protein level of caspase-3 cleaved fragments was analyzed by Western blotting. The annexin V stain assay was applied to explore the effect of caspase-3 inhibitor on the amelioration in synovial cells apoptosis of AA rats. Results: Typical morphology and biochemical feature of apoptosis in synovial cells of AA rats were observed with TFC. The protein level of caspase-3 cleaved fragments increased obviously and was related with the concentration of TFC in synovial cells of AA rats. The apoptotic cells positively stained with annexin V were markedly reduced by caspase-3 inhibitor. Conclusion: TFC can induce apoptosis in AA rats synoviocytes, which may achieve therapeutical effects in AA. The activation of caspase-3 may be one of the main causations.

63449113741	A subset of ulcerative colitis with positive proteinase-3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody	A small subset of patients with active ulcerative colitis is non-responsive to major known non-biological therapies. We reported 5 patients with positive serum proteinase-3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) and tried to (1) identify the common clinical features of these patients; (2) investigate the efficacy of a novel therapy using a Chinese medicine compound; and (3) attract more gastroenterologists to be engaged in further study of this subset of patients. The common manifestations of disease in these 5 patients included recurrent bloody diarrhea and inflammatory lesions involving the entire colorectal mucosa. Initial treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone successfully induced remission. Four of these 5 patients were steroid-dependence, and immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide, were ineffective. In 3 patients, only the particular Chinese medicine compound could induce and maintain remission. One patient underwent colectomy. No vascular inflammatory lesions were found by histopathological examination. Although more cases are needed for confirmation, our study indicates that ulcerative colitis with positive PR3-ANCA may belong to a subtype of refractory ulcerative colitis. The particular Chinese medicine compound used in our study is by far the most effective in the management of these patients, with additional advantages of having no noticeable side-effects and less financial burden. © 2008 The WJG Press.

70449111280	Role of Helicobacter pylori infection on neuronal expression in the stomach and spinal cord of a murine model	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Helicobactor pylori (H. pylori) infection on neuronal expressions in the stomach and spinal cord of mice so as to explain dyspepsia symptoms in H. pylori infected patients. METHODS: C57BL/6 female mice were studied at 2 weeks (acute infection group) and 12 weeks (chronic infection group) after H. pylori inoculation. Histological analyses for gastric inflammation and bacterial colonization were assessed by HE staining and Warthin-Starry staining. Fos, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide expressions (CGRP) were studied by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: H. pylori colonization was present mainly in pyloric region, but bacterial density was similar in both infected groups. The intensity of mucosal inflammation and activity was significantly higher in two infected groups than in those in the control group. The degree of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration in proventricular-glandular region and gastric corpus at 12 weeks after H. pylori inoculation was higher than that at 2 weeks after inoculation. The neuronal expressions of fos, VIP, and CGRP in the stomach and spinal cord were significantly more marked in the infected groups than in the control group, but there was no significant difference between two infected groups. CONCLUSION: H. pylori infection induced different degrees of gastric mucosal inflammation in the murine model. Both early and chronic infection groups of mice showed enhanced neuronal expressions of fos, VIP and CGRP of stomach and spinal cord and these could form a basis for appearance of functional dyspeptic symptoms in patients with H. pylori infection. © 2009 The Authors.

70849106444	Chemokine-like factor 1, a novel cytokine, induces nerve cell migration through the non-extracellular Ca2+-dependent tyrosine kinases pathway	Chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1) is a newly cloned chemotactic cytokine. The roles of CKLF1 in the immune system and the respiratory system have been reported, but its function in the nervous system is still remaining unclear. We aimed to investigate the role of CKLF1 in the nerve cell migration and its regulatory mechanisms. By chemotaxis assays and wound-healing assays, CKLF1 stimulated the migration of SH-SY5Y cells dose-dependently. By immunofluorescence staining, CKLF1 induced actin polymerization. By western blotting, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) was phosphorylated at Tyr-402 in response to CKLF1 and this phosphorylation was apparently suppressed by phospholipase C-γ inhibitor U73122, but not extracellular Ca

0035000148	Comparison of precancerous conditions: Atrophy and intestinal metaplasia in Helicobacter pylori gastritis among Chinese and Dutch patients	Aim - Atrophy and intestinal metaplasia (IM) as precancerous conditions consistently begin in the antrum and are most severe along the lesser curvature. The aim of this study was to investigate discrepancies in the prevalence, the severity of atrophy, and IM in antral mucosa of Helicobacter pylori infected gastritis and difference in age of onset among Chinese and Dutch patients. Methods - Two hundred and sixty five Chinese patients and 261 Dutch patients with H pylori infection were enrolled. The degrees of atrophy and IM were graded according to the updated Sydney system. Results - The overall prevalences of atrophy and IM were lower in Dutch patients (42% and 26%, respectively) than in Chinese patients (52% and 32%, respectively). Only the difference in atrophy reached significance (p = 0.028). However, in both Chinese and Dutch patients, the degrees of atrophy and IM were low and severe degrees were rare. The mean ages of Chinese and Dutch patients with atrophy and IM were higher than those without atrophy and IM (with atrophy (Chinese patients): mean, 42.12; SD, 9.80; with IM (Chinese patients): mean, 42.56; SD, 9.96; with atrophy (Dutch patients): mean, 55.16; SD, 12.20; with IM (Dutch patients): mean, 57.79; SD, 11.13; without atrophy (Chinese patients): mean, 39.71; SD, 10.16; without IM (Chinese patients): mean, 40.19; SD, 9.99; without atrophy (Dutch patients): mean, 45.70; SD, 12.44; without IM (Dutch patients): mean, 46.89; SD, 12.68). Atrophy and IM occurred earlier and were more severe in Chinese patients, with both reaching a peak value in patients over 60 years. Conclusions - There are geographical differences in the prevalence and severity of H pylori infected gastritis, in particular with respect to atrophy and IM, which suggests that infection with H pylori occurs earlier in life and has a higher prevalence in China.

72349084586	Prediction of histology and invasive depth of colorectal neoplasia based on morphology of surface depression using magnifying chromocolonoscopy	Background and study aims: Estimation of histology and depth of invasion in early colorectal neoplasia is essential for patient treatment. We therefore conducted a prospective study to examine whether the morphology of depression area contained at the surface of colorectal neoplasia can be used for predicting the histology and invasive depth. Methods: A series of 228 consecutive patients with 296 colorectal lesions were studied. All lesions were evaluated by magnifying chromocolonoscopy. Surface depression contained in the lesions was noted and the depressive morphology was further divided into two subgroups of type I and type II. All of the lesions were resected endoscopically or surgically and examined histologically for comparison. Results: A total of 296 lesions were evaluated, of which 66 (22.3%) contained an area of central depression, including 43 in nonpolypoid (flat and depressed) lesions (66%) and 23 in polypoid (10%). The overall accuracy of depressive morphology for distinction between low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia/invasive cancer, and between m-sm1 and sm2-sm3 was 86.4% and 84.8%, respectively. Conclusions: Depression was predominantly contained in nonpolypoid colorectal neoplasia. Morphology of depression observed by magnifying chromocolonoscopy could be used as a complementary method to assess the degree of atypia and invasive depth in colorectal neoplasia. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

77951753664	Rabeprazole combined with hydrotalcite is effective for patients with bile reflux gastritis after cholecystectomy	BACKGROUND: Regardless of surgical technique, patients who have undergone cholecystectomy appear to be predisposed to the development of bile reflux gastritis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of rabeprazole and hydrotalcite in patients with bile reflux gastritis after cholecystectomy. METHODS: Postcholecystectomy patients with bile reflux gastritis confirmed by endoscopy and 24 h gastric bilirubin monitoring were randomly assigned to one of four eight-week treatments: observation (group A), rabeprazole alone (group B), hydrotalcite alone (group C) and rabeprazole in combination with hydrotalcite (group D). Endoscopy and 24 h gastric bilirubin monitoring were repeated in all patients after treatment. Dyspeptic symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, heartburn, bitter taste, endoscopic and histological finding, and biliary reflux were evaluated before and after treatment. RESULTS: After administering medication, patient symptoms in groups B, C and D were relieved - most significantly in group D (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in endoscopic hyperemia and histological inflammation among the groups (P>0.05). However, histological activity, the number of reflux episodes and the number of reflux episodes lasting longer than 5 min were significantly decreased only in group D (P<0.05). The total per cent of bilirubin absorption (value of 0.14 units or greater) time was decreased in groups B, C and D, and most significantly in group D (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Rabeprazole combined with hydrotalcite is an effective therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with bile reflux gastritis after cholecystectomy. ©2010 Pulsus Group Inc.

77952674708	Osthole improves chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induced cognitive deficits and neuronal damage in hippocampus	This study is to investigate the effects of osthole on cognitive impairment and neuronal degeneration in hippocampus induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in rats, as well as the potential mechanism. Permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (2VO) induced severe cognitive deficits tested by the water maze task, along with oxidative stress and neuronal loss in hippocampus. Oral administration of osthole for 3. weeks markedly attenuated cognitive deficits and neuronal damage. Biochemical experiments revealed that osthole decreased the production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and significantly increased the activities of Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) and Catalase. Western blot analyses indicated that osthole prevented the downregulation of bcl-2 expression and upregulation of bax expression, which resulted in decreasing bax/bcl-2 ratio in hippocampus of 2VO rats. Additionally, osthole effectively alleviated the activation of caspase-3 induced by permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries. The observed results in present study suggest that osthole exhibits therapeutic potential for vascular dementia, which is most likely related, at least in part, to its antioxidation and anti-apoptotic actions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77953398630	Relationship between hepatic cell injury and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in rats with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis	Objective: To investigate the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in rats with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and its role in pathogenesis of NASH and fibrosis. Methods: Forty SD rats were divided into control group (fed with normal diet, n = 15) and NASH model group (fed with fat-rich diet, n = 25). All the rats were sacrificed at 20th week or 22nd week, and liver tissues were obtained for pathological examinations. The serum levels of the aminotransferase (ALT), total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) were determined, and the expression of ICAM-1 mRNA in liver tissues was detected by RT-PCR. Results: At the 20th week, no significant hepatic fibrosis was observed in model group. However, hepatic fibrosis appeared in most of the rats in model group at the 22nd week, and some rats showed early hepatic cirrhosis. At the 20th week and 22nd week, there were significant differences in serum ALT, TC and LDL-C between these two groups (P < 0.01). At the 20th week, there was no significant difference in the expression of ICAM-1 mRNA in liver tissues between these two groups (P > 0.05), while the expression of ICAM-1 mRNA was significantly higher in model group than that in control group at the 22nd week(P < 0.01). At the 22nd week, the expression of ICAM-1 mRNA was positively correlated with serum ALT, TC and LDL-C (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The expression of ICAM-1 mRNA increases with the development of inflammation and fibrosis in NASH rats, which indicates that ICAM-1 mRNA may play a role in the pathogenesis of liver injury.

77956273968	Expression and clinical significance of polycomb group protein EZH2 in the carcinogenesis and progression of gastric cancer	Background: EZH2, the core component of epigenetic regulator polycomb group proteins, can suppress the expression of target genes by catalyzing the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27. It is overexpressed in prostate cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer and some other malignancies, and its expression level is usually correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Aims: To investigate the role and clinical significance of EZH2 in the carcinogenesis and progression of gastric cancer, and its relationship with cell proliferation. Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis was used to detect the expressions of EZH2 and Ki-67 in specimens of 32 normal gastric mucosa, 34 chronic non-atrophic gastritis, 33 chronic atrophic gastritis, 40 dysplasia and 69 gastric cancer. The relevance of EZH2 with Ki-67 and the clinicopathologic characteristics of gastric cancer were analyzed. Results: In normal mucosa and chronic gastritis, the expression of EZH2 was mainly distributed in the neck of the gland. The expression level increased stepwisely in the specimens of normal gastric mucosa, chronic non-atrophic gastritis, chronic atrophic gastritis and dysplasia (P<0.05), while no significant difference was found between dysplasia and gastric cancer (P=0.678). Among groups of gastritis, dysplasia and gastric cancer, positive correlation was seen between the expressions of EZH2 and Ki-67 (P<0.01, respectively), and the overall expression of EZH2 was higher than that of Ki-67 in all specimens (P<0.01). The expression of EZH2 was correlated with the tumor size, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage of gastric cancer (P<0.05). Conclusions: Overexpression of EZH2 is an early molecular event of gastric carcinogenesis. EZH2 might be involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of gastric cancer by promoting proliferation of glandular epithelial cells.

78649615250	XRCC1 downregulated through promoter hypermethylation is involved in human gastric carcinogenesis	To analyze the expression and aberrant methylation of X-ray repair cross-complementing gene 1 (XRCC1) in gastric carcinogenesis, and identify the molecular mechanism of gastric carcinogenesis. METHODS: The method based on methyl binding domain protein (MBD) immuno-precipitation and promoter microarray was employed to screen the gastric cancer-related methylation-sensitive gene. An immunohistochemistry assay was applied to detect the protein expression of XRCC1 in the multistep progression of gastric carcinogenesis. The mRNA expression of XRCC1 was determined by real-time PCR in tumor tissues and their corresponding non-tumorous tissues. The methylation status and Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln polymorphisms of XRCC1 in gastric cancer and gastritis tissues were analyzed by methylation-specific PCR, bisulfite genomic sequencing and direct DNA sequencing, respectively. RESULTS: Promoter microarray screening and identification suggested that XRCC1 was a methylation-sensitive gene. Immunochemistry results showed that XRCC1 protein expression gradually decreased with progression of gastric mucosal lesions (P < 0.05). The positive rate of XRCC1 in patients with well/moderately differentiated gastric cancer was significantly higher than patients with poorly differentiated gastric cancer (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of XRCC1 in gastric cancer tissues was significantly lower than that in the non-tumorous tissues (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, XRCC1 methylation in gastric cancer tissues was more frequent than that in the gastritis tissues (P < 0.05), and the downregulation of XRCC1 expression was relevant to methylation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The expression of XRCC1 is downregulated in gastric carcinogenesis, and promoter hypermethylation may be one of the mechanisms contributing to its downregulation. © 2010 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

78650211885	Prediction of histology and invasive depth of colorectal neoplasia based on morphology of surface depression using magnifying chromocolonoscopy	Background and purpose: Estimation of histology and depth of invasion in early colorectal neoplasia is essential for patient treatment. We therefore conducted a prospective study to examine whether the morphology of depression area contained at the surface of colorectal neoplasia can be used for predicting the histology and invasive depth. Patients and methods: A series of 228 consecutive patients with 296 colorectal lesions were studied. All lesions were evaluated by magnifying chromocolonoscopy. Surface depression contained in the lesions was noted and the depressive morphology was further divided into two subgroups of type I and type II. All of the lesions were resected endoscopically or surgically and examined histologically for comparison. Results: A total of 296 lesions were evaluated, of which 66 (22.3%) contained an area of central depression, including 43 in nonpolypoid (flat and depressed) lesions (66%) and 23 in polypoid (10%). The overall accuracy of depressive morphology for distinction between low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia/invasive cancer, and between m-sm1 and sm2-sm3 was 86.4% and 84.8%, respectively. Conclusion: Depression was predominantly contained in nonpolypoid colorectal neoplasia. Morphology of depression observed by magnifying chromocolonoscopy could be used as a complementary method to assess the degree of atypia and invasive depth in colorectal neoplasia. © 2010 Urban & Vogel, Muenchen.

79251622569	Inhibitory effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on lipopolysaccharide-induced microglial activation in mice	Microglial activation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases by producing various pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO). In the paper, the anti-inflammatory effect of ginsenoside Rg1 was investigated in mice intracerebroventricular injected of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). NO and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus decreased at dose-dependent manner by oral administration with Rg1. And the expression of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) increased in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus in LPS-injected group compared to that in control group. However, Rg1 inhibited microglial activation by suppressing Iba-1 expression. In addition, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was inhibited by Rg1. Moreover, Rg1 suppressed the phosphorylation level of IκB, nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of NFκB, and phosphorylation level of p38, ERK1/2, JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) induced by LPS. Concluding, Rg1 inhibited the inflammation mediated by LPS by suppressing NFκB and MAPK pathway, which provided the explanation for its therapeutic effect on neurodegenerative diseases. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

78751569585	Validation of the simplified criteria for diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis in Chinese patients	Background & Aims: In 1999, the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) revised the diagnostic criteria for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). It subsequently developed the simplified criteria in 2008 to enhance clinical applicability and practicability. In this study, we validated the simplified diagnostic criteria in Chinese patients with AIH or other chronic liver diseases in comparison with the revised original criteria. Methods: Diagnostic scores were determined using the revised original criteria and the simplified criteria in 405 patients with diverse liver diseases. The sample included 127 patients with AIH type I diagnosed by the descriptive criteria, 77 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), 6 patients with AIH-PBC overlap syndrome, 47 patients with drug-induced liver injury (DILI), 36 patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 82 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and 30 patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The simplified criteria were compared to the revised original criteria based on sensitivity, specificity, and predictability for the pre-treatment diagnosis of AIH. Results: The simplified criteria had sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 95%, respectively, for the diagnosis of probable AIH in the Chinese patients. This compares well with the more rigorous revised original criteria, which had sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 93%, respectively, for probable AIH. On definite AIH, the simplified criteria had sensitivity and specificity of 62% and 99%, respectively, compared to 64% and 100% for definite AIH by the revised original criteria. In addition, the predictabilities of the revised original criteria and simplified criteria were 96% and 94% for probable AIH, and 88% and 87% for definite AIH, respectively, in our groups. Using the revised original criteria, 84 patients were diagnosed with definite AIH. On the other hand, among these 84 patients, the simplified criteria diagnosed only 61 patients with definite AIH (accordant diagnosis) and provided the 23 other patients with downgraded diagnosis. Comparison of the clinical and laboratory features of these two groups (accordant diagnosis vs. downgraded/excluded diagnosis) showed that the patients with downgraded diagnosis had significantly higher histological scores than the patients with accordant diagnosis. Conclusions: The simplified criteria are comparable to the revised original criteria and have high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of AIH in Chinese patients. Liver histology is critical for the diagnosis of AIH especially when using the simplified criteria. Further study or prospective evaluation is needed to confirm these observations, however, due to the small group of CHC patients as well as the absence of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) patients in our study. © 2010 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

79955416252	Interleukin-17 contributes to the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis through inducing hepatic interleukin-6 expression	T helper cells that produce IL-17 (Th17 cells) have recently been identified as the third distinct subset of effector T cells. Emerging data suggests that Th17 cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of many liver diseases by regulating innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and autoimmunity. In this study, we examine the role and mechanism of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The serum levels of IL-17 and IL-23, as well as the frequency of IL-17+ cells in the liver, were significantly elevated in patients with AIH, compared to other chronic hepatitis and healthy controls. The hepatic expressions of IL-17, IL-23, ROR-γt, IL-6 and IL-1β in patients with AIH were also significantly increased and were associated with increased inflammation and fibrosis. IL-17 induces IL-6 expression via the MAPK signaling pathway in hepatocytes, which, in turn, may further stimulate Th17 cells and forms a positive feedback loop. In conclusion, Th17 cells are key effector T cells that regulate the pathogenesis of AIH, via induction of MAPK dependent hepatic IL-6 expression. Blocking the signaling pathway and interrupting the positive feedback loop are potential therapeutic targets for autoimmune hepatitis. © 2011 Zhao et al.

0036091460	The molecular biological mechanism of effectiveness of folic acid in atrophic gastritis and gastric carcinogenesis	Aims: To study the relationships between the serum folate, mucosal lesions and some gene expressions in patients with atrophic gastritis. Methods: In 80 patients with moderate and severe atrophic gastritis diagnosed by endoscopy and histology the serum folate, mucosal lesions and gene expressions of p53, p16, Fas and proliferating cell nulear antigen (PCNA) were determined at baseline and one year after folic acid supplementation using microbiological, pathological and immunohistochemical assays. Results: 1 The serum folate was negatively correlated with atrophy (P=0.001), dysplasia (P=0.053) and Fas expression (P=0.09); 2 along with the elevated folate level, atrophy and intestinal metaplasia showed ameliorating tendency and reached statistical significance at high folate level (P=0.001, P=0.052) with down-regulation of p53 (P=0.056); 3 one year after the remarked increase in folate level, there was improvement of dysplasia (P=0.066) and down-regulation of gene expression of Fas and PCNA (P=0.007, P=0.083). Conclusions: Folate supplementation may influence some gene expressions in gastric mucosa, resulting in decrease of damage, inhibition of proliferation and improvement of atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia, leading to blockage of precancerous process. Hence, folic acid may be used to treat atrophic gastritis and intervene the gastric carcinogenesis.

0036164328	Helicobacter pylori associated gastric diseases and lymphoid tissue hyperplasia in gastric antral mucosa	Aim: To investigate the relation between Helicobacter pylori associated gastroduodenal diseases and lymphoid tissue hyperplasia in the antral mucosa and to pursue its evolution after eradication of H pylori. Methods: Gastric antral biopsy specimens were obtained from 438 patients with H pylori positive gastroduodenal diseases (185 chronic gastritis, 69 gastric ulcer, and 184 duodenal ulcer) and 50 H pylori negative healthy controls. Lymphoid follicles and aggregates were counted and other pathological features were scored according to the updated Sydney system for classification of chronic gastritis. After a course of anti-H pylori treatment, biopsy specimens were obtained at four to six weeks, 12 months, and 24 months in the chronic gastritis patient group. Results: The total prevalence of lymphoid follicles and aggregates in the biopsies was 79.9% (350 of 438; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.76 to 0.84). The prevalence and density of lymphoid follicles and aggregates were significantly different in the various gastroduodenal diseases. The highest prevalence (89.9%; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.97) and density (0.82) of lymphoid follicles and aggregates occurred in patients with gastric ulcers. The lowest prevalence of lymphoid follicles and aggregates was found in patients with chronic gastritis (74.6%; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.81), and the lowest density of lymphoid follicles and aggregates (0.56) was seen in patients with duodenal ulcers. The prevalence and density of lymphoid follicles and aggregates correlated strongly with the activity and severity of gastric antral mucosal inflammation. The eradication of H pylori resulted in a decrease in the prevalence and density of lymphoid follicles and aggregates. Conclusion: The prevalence and density of lymphoid follicles and aggregates in gastric antral mucosal biopsies correlated closely with H pylori infection.

0036297010	Effect of Helicobacter pylori infection on cyclooxygenase-2 expression in gastric antral mucosa	Objective: Helicobacter pylori infection is a major etiological cause of chronic gastritis. Inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) is an important regulator of mucosal inflammation. Recent studies indicate that expression of COX-2 may contribute to gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of H. pylori infection and eradication therapy on COX-2 expression in gastric antral mucosa. Methods: Antral biopsies were taken from 46 H. pylori-infected patients, who also had chronic gastritis, both before and after anti-H. pylori treatment. The COX-2 protein was stained by using immunohistochemical methods and COX-2 expression was quantified as the percentage of epithelial cells expressing COX-2. Gastritis and H. pylori infection status were graded according to the Sydney system. Results: Cyclooxygenase-2 expression was detected in the cytoplasm of gastric antral epithelial cells both before and after the eradication of H. pylori. Cyclooxygenase-2 expression in mucosa with H. pylori infection was compared with the corresponding mucosa after successful H. pylori eradication (20.1 ± 13.1% vs 13.8 ± 5.9%; P < 0.05). At the same time, COX-2 expression in H. pylori-infected mucosa was compared with the normal controls (18.0 ± 14.1% vs 12.3 ± 4.6%, P < 0.05). Expression of COX-2 was correlated with the degree of chronic inflammation (r = 0.78, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our results showed that H. pylori infection leads to gastric mucosal overexpression of COX-2 protein, suggesting that the enzyme is involved in H. pylori-related gastric pathology in humans.

0036432024	The influence of bile reflux, gastric acid and Helicobacter pylori infection on gastric mucosal injury: Severity and localization	Background: It is well known that bile reflux, gastric acid and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection cause gastric mucosal injury. However, the combinative roles of these factors were obscure. Aims: To investigate the damage of bile reflux, gastric acid and H. pylori infection to gastric mucosa on severity and localization. Methods: A total of consecutive 37 patients who were suspected with duodeno-gastric reflux, performed the 24-hour bile and gastric pH monitoring tests-simultaneously. Active inflammation, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and hyperplasia in the gastric mucosa of the corpus and antrum were investigated and scored. A stepwise Logistic regression analysis between gastric pathological changes and the time percentage of bilirubin absorption value > 0.14, the time percentage of pH < 4, and the presence of H. pylori was carried out. Results: The time percentage of bilirubin absorption value > 0.14 and pH < 4 were 34.49% ± 22.69% and 78.68% ± 9.91%, respectively. The H. pylori infection rate was 29.73%. Bile reflux was present in the Logistic regression models when there was intestinal metaplasia in the gastric mucosa of the corpus and antrum and active inflammation in the gastric mucosa of the corpus. H. pylori was present when there was active inflammation. Conclusions: Bile reflux causes intestinal metaplasia, and H. pylori is the most important etiological factor for corpus gastritis in the presence of bile reflux.

Methods: According to endoscopic diagnosis, patients with gastric cardiac inflammation and BE were selected from March 2008 to February 2009 in Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. Those patients who had histological findings of intestinal metaplasia (82 cases of CIM and 64 special type BE) were enrolled in our study. Hematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid-Schiff and Alcian blue staining and an immunohistochemical examination (CK-7, Muc-1) were undertaken in all of them. Results: Squamous mucosa overlying the columnar crypts with intestinal metaplasia, also called buried metaplasia, was often found in the BE group (56.2%), mainly as an incomplete type (85.9%). Inflammation in the gastric antrum was more severe in the CIM group (45.1% vs 26.6%), in contrast, esophagitis was more severe in the BE group (53.1% vs 35.4%). CK-7 was highly expressed in the BE group (84.4%) in contrast to the CIM group (37.8%). There was no difference in the expression of Muc-1 in these two kinds of intestinal metaplasia (14.1% vs 19.5%). Conclusions: Buried intestinal metaplasia, mainly as an incomplete type, is the major predominant type of BE. The degree of inflammation in the gastric antrum and esophagus can differentiate BE from CIM to some extent. CK-7 immunohistochemical staining can help identify BE and CIM but Muc-1 cannot. © 2011 The Authors.

However, there are only few studies on Mina53 expression in gastric cancer. Aims: To appraise the role and clinicopathologic significance of Mina53 in the development of gastric cancer. Methods: Immunohistochemical method was used to determine the locations and expressions of Mina53, c-Myc and Ki-67 in 68 gastric cancer and 30 normal antral specimens enrolled in this study, and the relationship between Mina53 and c-Myc, Ki-67 and clinicopathologic characteristics in gastric cancer tissues was analyzed. Results: The high expression rates of Mina53, c-Myc and Ki-67 were significantly higher in gastric cancer tissues than those in normal tissues (63.2% vs. 0%, P<0.001; 52.9% vs. 0%, P<0.001; 55.9% vs. 3.3%, P<0.001, respectively). The expression of Mina53 was correlated positively with expressions of c-Myc and Ki-67 in gastric cancer tissues (P<0.001, P<0.05). The high expression of Mina53 was independent of gender, age and tumor site, but was correlated with tumor size, differentiation, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis and TNM staging (P<0.01). Conclusions: The increased expression of Mina53 is a characteristic feature of gastric cancer, which is correlated positively with expressions of c-Myc and Ki-67, and correlated with clinicopathologic features including differentiation, invasion and metastasis. Mina53 may play some roles in gastric carcinogenesis, and has the potential to be used as a prognostic marker and target for gene therapy of gastric cancer.

The overall diagnostic accuracy of pre-EMR biopsy was 68.9%. Alterations of pathological diagnosis occurred in 28 lesions (31.1%), including 4 hyperplastic lesions changed to low grade dysplasia (LGD), 14 LGD changed to HGD, 5 LGD changed to adenocarcinoma, and 5 HGD changed to adenocarcinoma. Both the morphology of lesions and their infiltrating depth were not correlated with the changes of pathological diagnosis. Conclusions: Nearly 1/3 of the pathological diagnoses made by biopsy at conventional colonoscopy are corrected after EMR in this study. EMR under the guidance of magnifying chromoendoscopy has a dual effect of enhancing the diagnosis and treatment for colorectal neoplasia.

80054056681	Effects of PcG protein EZH2-targeting siRNA on proliferation and invasiveness of human gastric cancer cell line MKN45	Background: Polycomb group (PcG) protein is a group of transcriptional repressor. EZH2, the crucial component of PcG protein is overexpressed in gastric cancer, and positively correlated with the progression of this malignancy. Aims: To study the effects of EZH2 on proliferation and invasiveness of human gastric cancer cell line MKN45, and to clarify the molecular mechanism of EZH2 in gastric tumorigenesis by using RNA interference (RNAi) technique. Methods: Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting to EZH2 was transfected into MKN45 cells, and then the expression levels of EZH2 mRNA and protein were detected by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. The cell proliferation was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, the cell cycle distribution was assessed by flow cytometry, and the invasive ability was examined by Matrigel™ invasive assay. Results: EZH2 siRNA could effectively reduce the expression levels of EZH2 mRNA and protein in MKN45 cells. Compared with the siRNA negative controls, the proliferation of MKN45 cells in EZH2 siRNA group was obviously inhibited with an inhibition rate of 14.7% (P<0.05), the invasive ability was significantly decreased (cells crossing the membrane of Transwell Chamber, 38.5±3.4 vs. 92.7±9.7 per high power field, P<0.05), and the cell cycle was arrested at G0/G1 and G2/M phases. Conclusions: EZH2 siRNA can reduce the proliferation and invasiveness of human gastric cancer cells, which suggests that EZH2 plays a role in gastric tumorigenesis by promoting cell proliferation and invasiveness.

80054060868	Current status of studies on etiology and morphology of diseases at esophagogastric junction	Esophagogastric junction (EGJ) is a special histological region located between esophagus and stomach. Gastric cardia is an area that connects distal esophagus and gastric fundus; the question of its existence and length is still controversial. Diseases at EGJ mainly include carditis, reflux esophagitis (RE) and Barrett's esophagus (BE). A correlation exists between these three types of lesion. RE can lead to intestinal metaplasia of esophageal epithelium and cause BE, which is a precancerous lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma and needs follow up. Carditis can also lead to intestinal metaplasia. Recent investigations have shown that intestinal metaplasia in BE are accompanied by some special morphologic features, including hybrid glands, esophageal glands/ducts, multilayered epithelium and pancreatic acinar metaplasia. Improving the identification of BE from morphology can clinically help its monitoring.

84856760156	Activation of liver X receptors attenuates endotoxin-induced liver injury in mice with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease	Background/Aims: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is classically associated with insulin resistance and the inflammatory response, especially in the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis phase. The liver X receptors (LXRs) play a critical role in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and inflammatory processes. Methods: Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet (ND) or a high-fat (HF) diet for 8 weeks. Some ND- and HF-fed mice were treated (i.p.) with the LXR agonist T0901317 (30 mg/kg/day) for 7 days. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50 μg/mouse) was then injected intraperitoneally to induce liver injury. The activation of MAPKs, NF-κB and the PI3K pathway was evaluated using Western blot. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (MDMs) were isolated from the femurs of C57BL/6 mice and cultured with or without T0901317 (20 μmol/l). The expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was evaluated in vitro or in vivo using real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, or Western blot. Results: The LXR agonist T0901317 attenuated LPS-induced liver injury in a murine model of NAFLD, reflected by reduced serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and reduced liver histology changes. Activation of LXRs reduced TNF-α and iNOS expression through inhibiting JNK and the PI3K signaling pathway. An in vitro study demonstrated that the activation of LXR inhibited the expression of TNF-α and iNOS in the MDMs of mice. Conclusions: Activation of LXRs attenuates LPS-induced liver injury in murine NAFLD through inhibiting the pro-inflammatory activity of macrophages. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84863043962	Effects of diammonium glycyrrhizinate lipid ligand on NF-κB expression in the rat with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease	Objective: To study therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of diammonium glycyrrhizinate lipid ligand (DGLL) on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods: Sixty SD rats were randomly divided into six groups (10 rats per group): the model group, 3 DGLL-treated (30, 60, 120mg/kg) groups, the positive control [treated with biphenyldicarboxylate (200mg/kg)] group and normal control group. The stomach of the rat of the model group was irrigated with high lipid emulsion. The rats of DGLL groups were irrigated with relative dose of DGLL. After nine weeks, the changes of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) in serum and the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver homogenate were measured; the NF-κB p65 level in liver tissues was observed by immunohistochemistry, respectively. The expressions of NF-κB p65 and I-κBα in liver were determined by Western blotting. Results: Compared with the model group, the levels of TC, TG, LDL, MDA were decreased, meanwhile the activity of HDL and SOD were enhanced, the level of NF-κB in liver tissues was ameliorated remarkably by administration of DGLL. Meanwhile, the up-regulation of NF-κB p65 activity and degradation of I-κBα were reversed by DGLL treatment. Conclusion: DGLL ameliorated rat NF-κB expression with NAFLD, which was related to NF-κB p65 down-regulation.

Methods: The expressions of Bmi-1, c-myc, and enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in normal gastric mucosa, chronic non-atrophic gastritis, chronic atrophic gastritis, dysplasia and gastric adenocarcinoma tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: The positive expression rates of Bmi-1 in normal gastric mucosa, chronic non-atrophic gastritis, chronic atrophic gastritis, dysplasia and gastric carcinoma tissues were 5.0%, 16.7%, 30.7%, 58.1% and 78.0%, respectively. There was a significant difference in positive expression rate of Bmi-1 among different gastric tissues (P<0.05). The high expression rate of Bmi-1 (45.0%) in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues was associated with tumor size, differentiation, invasion depth, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (P<0.05).

84863326886	CTHRC1 is upregulated by promoter demethylation and transforming growth factor-β1 and may be associated with metastasis in human gastric cancer	The gene, collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (CTHRC1), has been reported to increase in several kinds of human solid cancers and is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. To date, the expression and function of CTHRC1 in gastric cancer (GC) have not been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression levels and regulatory transcription mechanisms of CTHRC1 in GC. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CTHRC1 expression was markedly increased in carcinoma compared with normal gastric mucosa, chronic atrophic gastritis, and intestinal metaplasia (P < 0.05 for all), and this overexpression in tumor was related to depth of tumor invasion. Moreover, RNA interference-mediated knockdown and ectopic expression of CTHRC1 showed that CTHRC1 promoted tumor cell invasion in vitro. We then investigated the mechanisms underlying the aberrant expression of CTHRC1 in GC and found that CTHRC1 expression was restored after GC cell lines were treated with the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Transforming growth factor-β1 led to an increase in levels of CTHRC1 mRNA and protein. Overall, our data revealed that the upregulated expression of CTHRC1 in gastric carcinogenesis contributes to tumor cell invasion and metastasis, and promoter demethylation and transforming growth factor-β1 may co-regulate the expression of CTHRC1. © 2012 Japanese Cancer Association.

84863350521	Expression and clinical significance of caveolin-1 in microenvironment of gastric adenocarcinoma	Background: Tumorigenesis and progress is the result of combined action of parenchyma and stroma in tumor microenvironment. The expression of caveolin-1 in microenvironment of gastric cancer has been seldomly investigated. Aims: To investigate the expression and clinical significance of caveolin-1 in microenvironment of gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC). Methods: Seventy-two surgical resected specimens of GAC and thirty-two normal antral specimens as controls were obtained for immunohistochemical assessment of the expressions of caveolin-1 and proto-oncogene protein c-myc in parenchyma and stroma. The correlation between parenchymal caveolin-1 and c-myc, as well as between parenchymal caveolin-1 and main clinicopathological characteristics of GAC was analyzed. Seven frozen specimens of GAC were subjected to laser capture microdissection (LCM) at random to obtain the pure parenchymal and stromal cells of cancerous and paracancerous tissues. Western blot was conducted to determine the expressions of caveolin-1 and c-myc, and the correlation between these two proteins was analyzed. Results: In routine specimens, the high expression rate of caveolin-1 in parenchyma and stroma of GAC was lower than that of normal gastric mucosa, respectively (P<0.05). The expression of c-myc was upregulated in parenchyma of GAC, and was positively correlated with caveolin-1 (r=0.312, P<0.05). The high expression of caveolin-1 in parenchyma was negatively correlated with the depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage of GAC (P<0.05). Samples obtained by LCM showed that the expression of caveolin-1 in parenchyma and stroma of GAC was lower than that of paracancerous tissues, respectively (P<0.05). The expression of caveolin-1 was positively correlated with c-myc in parenchyma (r=0.752, P<0.05), and was negatively correlated with c-myc in stroma (r=-0.975, P<0.05). Conclusions: The expression of caveolin-1 in microenvironment of GAC isdownregulated. The high expression of caveolin-1 in parenchyma is negatively correlated with invasion, metastasis and clinical progress of GAC. c-myc may regulate the expression of caveolin-1 in parenchyma and stroma of GAC by different mechanisms, and lower expression of caveolin-1 in stroma may provide a basis for prognostic prediction of GAC.

Methods: Apoptosis of RAW264.7 macrophages is induced by 0.5 μmol/L Tg and 50 μg/ml Fuc. The cell survival rate and apoptosis rate was detected by MTT and flow cytometry, respectively. Results: There was statistical significance between the berberine group of 800 μg/ml and normal group in the cell survival rate(P<0.01). With the decline in concentration of berberine, the cell apoptosis rate showed a downward trend, berberine (0.02-0.63 μg/ml) effectively inhibited the cell apoptosis induced by Tg and Fuc. Conclusion: Berberine group has little impact on the cell proliferation. Berberine can effectively inhibit the cell apoptosis induced by Tg and Fuc.

84865098039	Chronic atrophic gastritis is a progressive disease: Analysis of medical reports from Shanghai (1985-2009)	Introduction We aimed to examine the turnover of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) pathologically and endoscopically and explore its potential causes. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted of prospective data collected from 1,592 patients who underwent gastroscopy three times or more during the period 1985-2009 at Renji Hospital, Shanghai, China. Pathological and endoscopic findings were analysed. Data collected included gender, age, length of follow-up period, family history, past medical history, history of Helicobacter (H.) pylori infection, drug history for the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), antacids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and lifestyle history, including the patients' eating habits. Resu lts 23 (1.44%) patients presented with gastric cancers resulting from CAG and 349 (21.92%) patients had dysplasia. Pathological and endoscopic findings suggested that the proportion of patients with worsening gastric mucosa during the atrophic and intestinal metaplasia (IM) phases was over 35% with increasing age. Gastric mucosa was found to be pathologically aggravated by carbonated drinks and fast food, and pathologically degenerated by H. pylori infection. Smoking deteriorated the gastric mucosa. Side dishes of vegetables may benefit the gastric mucosa even in the atrophic and IM phases. Conclusion Our findings support the consensus that CAG is a progressive disease. Potential factors that were found to affect the state of the gastric mucosa in our patient group were gender, H. pylori infection, use of PPIs or NSAIDs, and intake of vegetable side dishes, spicy food, carbonated drinks and fast food.

84865393551	The immunopathology of liver granulomas in primary biliary cirrhosis	Liver granulomas and elevated serum IgM are commonly observed in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) but their pathogenetic significance remains largely unknown. To address this issue we performed an extensive immunostaining and colocalization study of markers associated with dendritic cells and IgM in a large cohort of tissue samples from PBC and control livers as well as from non-hepatic granulomatous diseases. First, the classical dendritic cell CD11c marker is highly expressed and more sensitive than classical hematoxylin-eosin staining in detecting granulomas associated with PBC and other conditions. Second, PBC cases with CD11c-positive granulomas have significantly higher serum IgM levels and earlier disease stages. Third, granulomas from PBC and other diseases demonstrate markers of dendritic cell immaturity, i.e. CD11b, reduced MHC II, IL-23, CCR7 and CD83 expression, and elevated C1q expression. Lastly, B cells and IgM-positive plasma cells are largely represented around PBC granulomas along with macrophages. In conclusion, our comprehensive immunohistochemical study suggests that dendritic cells are key to the pathogenesis of granulomas, regardless of their origin. More specifically, PBC liver granulomas may result from the interaction between immature dendritic cells and IgM. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84865983010	Isoliquiritigenin treatment induces apoptosis by increasing intracellular ROS levels in HeLa cells	This study focuses on the relationship between the apoptosis induced by isoliquiritigenin (ISL) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cell viability was evaluated using sulforhodamine B assay. The apoptotic rate was determined via flow cytometry. Intracellular ROS level was assessed using the 2,7-dichlorofluorescein probe assay. Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) protein expression was examined using Western blot analysis. The results showed that ISL treatment inhibited cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. The increased apoptotic rate and ROS production induced by ISL were inhibited by the co-treatment of ISL and free radical scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), catalase (CAT), and 4,5-dihydroxyl-1,3-benzededisulfonic acid (Tiron). On the contrary, the increased apoptotic rate and the ROS production were compensated by the co-treatment of ISL and l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO). ISL treatment increased the degradation of PARP, which was counteracted by antioxidants (NAC or CAT), whereas the combination treatment of ISL and pro-oxidant (BSO) enhanced the PARP degradation induced by ISL. Our findings suggested that ISL treatment induced apoptosis by increasing intracellular ROS levels in HeLa cells. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Methods: The COX-2 protein and mRNA were investigated in 27 HCC tissues with adjacent nontumorous tissues, and 5 histologically normal liver tissues, using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Results: The well-differentiated HCC expressed COX-2 protein (5.68±1.19) more strongly than moderated HCC (3.43±1.98) and poor differentiated HCC (3.33±1.50) (P<0.05 respectively), adjacent nontumorous tissues (4.93±1.05) and normal liver tissues (3.20±1.92) (P<0.01 respectively); More intensive staining of COX-2 in adjacent nontumorous tissues was observed than that in normal liver tissues (P<0.05). There was no significant difference among adjacent nontumorous tissues, moderately differentiated HCC and poorly differentiated HCC (P>0.05). The expression of COX-2 mRNA was observed in the cytoplasm of the cells of HCC and of the hepatocytes in adjacent nontumorous tissues in which COX-2 protein was positive. Conclusion: The overexpression of COX-2 in well-differentiated HCC suggests that COX-2 may play a role in the early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis.

In some animal models, Induction of oral tolerance can inhibit autoimmune reaction. Aims: To investigate the effect of oral tolerance on murine experimental autoimmune hepatitis (EAH). Methods: The EAH model was made as follows: 0.5 ml 0.5-2 g/L syngeneic hepatic S-100 antigen emulsified in complete Freud's adjuvant was injected intraperitoneally to C57BL/6 mice at 1st and 7th day of the experiment. The mice were fed with hepatic S-100 antigen, the first, second and third fraction of hepatic S-100 antigen (1 mg and 10 mg) daily, respectively for 5 days before induction of EAH. At the same time, the controls were fed with 0.1 ml PBS. Results: The mice fed with the first fraction of hepatic S-100 antigen at high dosage showed significantly lower inflammatory activity of the liver tissue histologically, and decrease of the level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (P< 0.05, respectively). The serum level of ALT decreased significantly in mice fed with hepatic S-100 antigen at high dosage (P<0.05), the histological severity grade of the liver was also reduced, but not reached the significant difference. Conclusions: Oral administration of the first fraction of hepatic S-100 antigen can induce immunological tolerance in EAH mice.

84868007878	Immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of artesunate in experimental colitis	Background: Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic and idiopathic gastrointestinal inflammation mediated by disregulated immune responses. Artemisinin (a chemical from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine Artemisia annua L.) and its derivatives have been proven to exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis with low side-effects. This study is aimed to evaluate the potential therapeutic value of artesunate for inflammatory bowel disease. Methods: Murine colitis was induced by either oral administration of dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) or intrarectal delivery of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) or oxazolone. Mice were treated with artesunate (150mg/kg/day). Peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of artesunate. Changes in cytokines or proteins of interests were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or SDS-PAGE/Western blot. Results: Artesunate significantly ameliorated DSS colitis and TNBS colitis (but not oxazolone colitis), including reduced weight loss and disease activity, as well as macroscopic and microscopic colonic injury. The expression of NF-tcBp65 and p-ItcB-a were reduced in artesunate treated TNBS colitis compared with untreated. The levels of IFN-γ, IL-17, and TNF-a were significantly decreased in artesunate treated TNBS colitis or DSS colitis. Furthermore, in vitro artesunate treatment significantly inhibited TNF-α production by LPS-activated macrophages. Conclusions: Artesunate suppresses TNF-a expression in vitro and in vivo as well as T-helper (Th)1/Th17 responses in TNBS colitis model. Our data suggest a novel clinical application of artesunate as a potential therapy for Crohn's disease. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

84867761422	Predictive value of neutrophil infiltration as a marker of Helicobacter pylori infection	Aim: To evaluate the predictive value of neutrophil infiltration as a marker of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Methods: A total of 315 patients with dyspepsia symptoms who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were enrolled in this study. Biopsies were evaluated using the updated Sydney system. The medication history of all patients in the preceding 4 wk was recorded. The diagnosis of H. pylori infection was based on 13C-urea breath test at least 4 wk after withdrawal of antisecretory drugs, antibiotics and related drugs. For the patients with subtotal gastrectomy, the diagnosis of H. pylori infection was based on anti-H. pylori immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody. Serum anti-H. pylori IgG antibody was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Biohit, Finland). Results: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of neutrophil infiltration in the diagnosis of H. pylori infection were 92.3%, 83.5%, 77.4% and 94.7%, respectively. Neutrophil infiltration of gastric mucosa in the histological analysis was strongly associated with H. pylori infection (77.4% vs 5.3% in the neutrophil infiltration negative group, P = 0.000). Moderate neutrophil infiltration was more frequent in H. pylori infection when compared to mild infiltration (81.8% and 75%, respectively), but did not reach statistical significance. For those patients with negative rapid urease test, H. pylori was detected in 73.2% of patients with positive neutrophil infiltration on histology. In patients with subtotal gastrectomy, the diagnostic accuracy of neutrophil infiltration in H. pylori infection was 50%. Conclusion: Neutrophil infiltration is closely associated with H. pylori and may be recognized as a sign of this infection. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84869211139	Application of magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging in diagnosing gastric lesions: A prospective study	Background: Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI) can more clearly assess the surface pattern and microvascular architecture of gastric lesions. Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of ME-NBI in patients with early gastric cancer. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Single academic center. Patients: This study involved 164 suspected gastric lesions in 146 consecutive patients who underwent ME-NBI for additional differential diagnosis before treatment. Intervention: ME-NBI findings were classified into 3 groups based on irregularities, absence of surface pattern, and microvascular architecture. All lesions were treated endoscopically or surgically, and ME-NBI diagnosis was compared with histopathological findings. Main Outcome Measurements: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of real-time ME-NBI diagnosis were determined. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ME-NBI were 97.3%, 84.4%, and 90.2%, respectively, in distinguishing between cancerous and noncancerous lesions and were 92.3%, 89.7%, and 90.4%, respectively, in distinguishing undifferentiated from differentiated adenocarcinoma. ME-NBI accurately predicted depth of invasion in 37 of 39 differentiated adenocarcinomas (95%). Limitations: The sample size was relatively small. Conclusions: ME-NBI can successfully distinguish between cancerous and noncancerous lesions and between undifferentiated and differentiated adenocarcinomas. Of the 3 patterns on ME-NBI, type A is mainly characteristic of noncancerous lesions, type B is a good indicator of differentiated adenocarcinoma and intramucosal/superficially invasive cancers, and type C is indicative of undifferentiated adenocarcinoma or differentiated cancer with deep submucosal invasion. © 2012 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

84870158803	NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species are involved in the HL-60 cell monocytic differentiation induced by isoliquiritigenin	The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in isoliquiritigenin (ISL)-induced monocytic differentiation in human acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Morphological changes, cell surface markers CD11b/CD14 and NBT-reducing ability were used to determine the differentiation of HL-60 cells, and 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH-DA) was used to detect the level of intracellular ROS. ISL-induced HL-60 cell differentiation was accompanied by an increase in the intracellular ROS levels. L-Buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6- tetramethylpiperidinoxyl (Tempol) were used to interfere with ROS production. NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin (APO) and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) were used to study the role of NADPH oxidase in ISL-induced HL-60 cell differentiation. The ISL-induced HL-60 cell differentiation and intracellular ROS generation were enhanced by the oxidant BSO and inhibited by the antioxidants NAC, SOD, and tempol, and were also inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors APO and DPI. The protein and mRNA expression of the NADPH oxidase subunits gp91phox and p47phox were determined by Western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively. The levels of translation and transcription of the NADPH oxidase subunits gp91phox and p47phox increased markedly in a concentration-dependent manner. These findings suggest that NADPH oxidase plays a critical role in HL-60 cell differentiation induced by ISL and that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS is involved in the differentiation mechanism. © 2012 by the authors.

84871150122	Expression and clinical significance of tumor suppressor gene RRM1 in carcinogenesis and progression of gastric cancer	Background: RRM1 may be involved in the carcinogenesis of several tumors. It is reported that RRM1 suppresses migration of cell and metastasis in part by inducing tumor suppressor gene PTEN expression. However, there are few studies on RRM1 in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. Aims: To investigate the role and clinical significance of expression of RRM1 in the carcinogenesis and progression of gastric cancer. Methods: The localizations and expressions of RRM1 and PTEN in the mucosa of 57 cases of chronic non-atrophic gastritis (CNAG), 43 cases of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), 30 cases of gastric dysplasia (DYS) and 51 cases of gastric cancer were detected by immunohistochemistry. The correlation of RRM1 expression with PTEN expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of gastric cancer were analyzed. Results: Expressions of RRM1 and PTEN were decreases stepwisely in gastric mucosa of CNAG, CAG, DYS and gastric cancer (P<0.05), and the expression of RRM1 was positively correlated with expression of PTEN (P<0.01). RRM1 expression in gastric cancer was not correlated with patient's gender, age, tumor size, location, depth of invasion, Lauren classification, lymph node metastasis and TNM staging, but correlated with the degree of differentiation (P<0.05). Conclusions: Expression of tumor suppressor gene RRM1 decreases progressively with the progress of stages of gastric carcinogenesis, and is positively correlated with the expression of PTEN and differentiation of gastric cancer. Thus RRM1 may be involved in the gastric carcinogenesis as a tumor suppressor gene, which is partially mediated through induction of PTEN expression.

84871204479	Value of confocal laser endomicroscopy for diagnosis of residual and recurrent lesions after endoscopic submucosal dissection	Background: Recently, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been widely used in curative treatment of precancerous lesions and early gastric cancer (EGC). The residual and recurrent neoplastic tissue after ESD are difficult to detect by conventional white light endoscopy, however, confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) can provide real time in vivo histological evaluation of mucosal lesions without the need for biopsy. Aims: To investigate the value of CLE for diagnosis of residual and recurrent lesions after ESD. Methods: Consecutive patients undergone ESD for gastric intraepithelial neoplasia or EGC between Jun. 2009 and Dec. 2011 at Shanghai Renji Hospital were enrolled. CLE was performed 1, 3 and 6 months after ESD. The results of CLE were analyzed in correlation with the final histological diagnosis based on ESD, additional resections after CLE, and biopsies of CLE. Results: Twenty patients undergone ESD were enrolled and completed the CLE follow up. CLE diagnosed residual lesion as high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) in 2 cases 1 month after ESD, and recurrent lesion as HGIN in 1 case 6 months after ESD. Pathological evaluation of the additional surgical excision specimen showed HGIN for 2 residual lesions and early differentiated adenocarcinoma for 1 recurrent lesion. No residual or recurrent lesions were found by 3 sessions of CLE in other 17 patients. Conclusions: CLE can diagnose residual and recurrent lesion and is valuable as an endoscopic surveillance after ESD.

84872150727	Isoliquiritigenin-induced differentiation in mouse melanoma B16F0 cell line	The chemotherapeutical treatment is very limited for malignant melanoma, a highly lethal disease occurs globally. Natural products derived from traditional Chinese medicine licorice are attractive in quest new treatments due to their anti-tumor activities. A new dietary flavonoid isoliquiritigenin (ISL) were thus investigated to indentify its anti-melanoma activities on mouse melanoma B16F0 cells in present study. Using biochemical and free radical biological experiments in vitro, we identified the pro-differentiated profiles of ISL and evaluated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during B16F0 cell differentiation. The data showed a strong dose-response relationship between ISL exposure and the characteristics of B16F0 differentiation in terms of morphology changes and melanogenesis. The accumulated intercellular ROS during exposure are necessary to support ISL-induced differentiation, which was proven by additional redox modulators. It was confirmed further by the relative activities of enzymes and genes modulated melanogenesis in ISL-treatments with or without ROS modulators. The tumorigenicity of ISL-treated cells was limited significantly by using the colony formation assay in vitro and an animal model assay in vivo respectively. Our research demonstrated that isoliquiritigenin is a differentiation-inducing agent, and its mechanisms involve ROS accumulation facilitating melanogenesis. © 2012 Xiaoyu Chen et al.

84874716405	Overexpression of p21-activated kinase 1 promotes endometrial cancer progression	Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic malignancy, but the molecular events involved in the development and progression of EC remain unclear. P21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) plays important roles in cell motility and survival. This study investigated the clinical significance of Pak1 expression and its functional roles in EC. The expression of Pak1 in clinical samples and EC cell lines was evaluated. The effects of Pak1 on EC cell functions were determined by either overexpressing it via plasmid transfection or depleting its expression using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in human EC cell lines. Pak1 was overexpressed in clinical samples of EC compared with normal endometrium. High Pak1 expression in EC was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis, advanced disease stage and poor histological differentiation. Pak1 overexpression was also observed in multiple human EC cell lines. In EC cell lines, Pak1 overexpression promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth in vitro. Conversely, shRNA-mediated stable knockdown of Pak1 reduced cell proliferation, migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth. In addition, ectopic Pak1 overexpression protected EC cells from apoptosis, along with decreased caspase-3 activation. These results suggest that Pak1 plays important roles at multiple stages of EC progression. © 2013 Spandidos Publications Ltd. All rights reserved.

84875950918	Epigenetic considerations and the clinical reevaluation of the overlap syndrome between primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis	Epigenetic changes are of crucial importance in the etiopathogenesis of autoimmune liver diseases. Among these, there is limited agreement on the definitions and treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) overlap syndromes, we evaluated a large series of consecutive patients with PBC (n = 565) and AIH (n = 196) to identify a group of patients with corticosteroid-responsive PBC-AIH overlap syndrome. Within this series, a total of 490 patients were biopsied based upon staging or diagnostic needs. Review of the biopsies in conjunction with the International AIH Group criteria identified 80 patients with suspected overlap syndrome and 52 patients agreed to participate in the study and were prospectively treated with corticosteroids. Of these, 40/52 (77%) achieved a complete biochemical response (i.e. normal ALT, AST, and IgG) within 12 months of treatment. A survey of pre-treatment characteristics of the 40 responders revealed more severe interface hepatitis. Serum IgG levels ≥1.3x the upper limit of normal had 60% sensitivity and 97% specificity rates for steroid-responsiveness while the use of a higher threshold (≥2.0x) reduced sensitivity to 10%. When the Paris criteria for PBC-AIH were applied to the steroid-responsive patients, 29/40 (73%) cases fulfilled at least two of the three Paris criteria. Applying the recently designed simplified IAIHG scoring system, 35/40 (88%) had a "definite" diagnosis of AIH. This study supports the hypothesis that a complete response to corticosteroids may denote a variant of a PBC-AIH overlap syndrome which could be identified prior to treatment by modified Paris criteria in concert with the simplified IAIHG scoring system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84878180195	Regulation of synoviocyte activity by resveratrol in rats with adjuvant arthritis	The aim of this study was to investigate the preventive effects of resveratrol (Res) on rats with adjuvant arthritis (AA) and the mechanism(s) of action. An AA model was established by injection of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was visualized in joint specimens using immunohistochemistry. IL-1β and TNF-α production in synoviocytes was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The mRNA expression of IL-1β and TNF-α was observed in synoviocytes using the reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method. The synoviocytes of the AA model were stimulated by Res or treated with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine prior to stimulation. The expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) was detected by western blotting. Res was able to reduce the elevated levels of IL-1β and TNF-α, and inhibit the mRNA expression of IL-1β and TNF-α in the synoviocytes of the AA model rats. VEGF expression in the Res-treated group was significantly lowered. The protein expression levels of p-ERK1/2 were significantly higher in the Res-treated group compared with those of the model group, while p-ERK1/2 was markedly lower in the group pretreated with chelerythrine. Res has a therapeutic effect on AA rats, which may be correlated with its immunoregulatory actions, and may activate p-ERK1/2 in synoviocytes via PKC.

84879442785	Computed tomography enterography versus balloon-assisted enteroscopy for evaluation of small bowel lesions in Crohn's disease	Background and Aim: We aimed to assess the correlation between computed tomography enterography (CTE) and balloon-assisted enteroscopy on severity of small bowel lesions, and evaluated the accuracy of CTE parameters in assessing small intestine lesions in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Methods: We performed an observational study of a single-center cohort. Data were retrieved from our inpatient databases starting from October 2007. Correlations between computed tomography parameters (bowel wall thickness, mural enhancement, comb sign, extramural findings, and stricture), endoscopic and histological severity scores, CD Activity Index [CDAI], and C-reactive protein were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation. Results: Seventy patients were included in this study. One hundred fifty-seven segments were examined. Bowel wall thickness (r=0.6334, P<0.0001), mural enhancement (r=0.5477, P<0.0001), comb sign (r=0.5898, P<0.0001), and extramural findings (r=0.4754, P<0.0001) were moderately correlated with the segmental Capsule Endoscopy CDAI. The segmental CTE score also moderately correlated with the segmental Capsule Endoscopy CDAI (r=0.6714, P<0.0001), while the total CTE score strongly correlated with the total Capsule Endoscopy CDAI (r=0.7252, P<0.0001). Both total CTE score (r=0.5937, P<0.0001) and total Capsule Endoscopy CDAI (r=0.6364, P<0.0001) correlated significantly with the Harvey-Bradshaw Index. Of five computed tomography parameters, bowel wall thickness have the best accuracy to detect small intestine lesions with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.811 (P<0.0001), with a sensitivity and specificity of 81.82% and 74.14%, respectively. Conclusion: CTE is a reliable technique for detecting small intestine lesions in patients with CD, also provides accurate information on small bowel CD severity and activity, with close agreement to inflammatory markers, CDAI, and histopathology. © 2013 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84880060643	Folic acid prevents the initial occurrence of sporadic colorectal adenoma in Chinese older than 50 years of age: A randomized clinical trial	Colorectal adenoma (CRA) is the precursor lesion of colorectal cancer (CRC). Several agents have been shown to be effective in the chemoprevention of CRA recurrence, but there has been little research on its primary prevention. Participants older than 50 years with no adenomas were recruited for our study and randomized to receive either 1 mg/day folic acid supplement or treatment without folic acid. After 3 years of follow-up, plasma folate and colonoscopy were evaluated. Seven hundred ninety-one participants (91.98%) completed the study. CRA occurred in 64 (14.88%) participants in the folic acid group and 132 (30.70%) in the control group [unadjusted risk ratio (RR), 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37- 0.63; P < 0.01]; left-sided adenoma (unadjusted RR, 0.54;95% CI, 0.38-0.76; P=0.001) and advanced CRA (unadjusted RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16-0.81; P = 0.01) were most common. There was no significance difference in the occurrence of three or more adenomas (unadjusted RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.36-1.77; P=0.38) or right-sided adenoma (unadjusted RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.30-1.00; P = 0.07) between the two groups. Participants with low plasma folate may have a high risk of CRA. In conclusion, primary prevention with 1 mg/day folic acid supplementation could reduce the incidence of CRA, especially left-sided and advanced disease in those with no previous adenomas. People with differing baseline plasma folate levels should be given individualized treatment. Those with low plasma folate should be encouraged to take adequate supplements; plasma folate should be elevated to an effective therapeutic level, which may reduce the incidence of CRA.

84881629535	Effect and significance of nuclear antigen Mina53 on human gastric carcinoma cells	As a downstream direct target gene of oncogene Myc, nuclear antigen Mina53 is over-expressed in some carcinomas of digestive system, and is demonstrated to be related with tumor proliferation, invasiveness, metastasis and survival of patients. To investigate the effect of Mina53 on human gastric carcinoma cells and its significance in the occurrence and development of gastric carcinoma. SGC7901 and AGS, two human gastric carcinoma cell lines with high expression levels of Mina53, were selected and transfected with Mina53 siRNA to knock down Mina53. Cells transfected with siRNA containing inert sequence were served as controls. Cell proliferation was assessed by CCK-8 assay, cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry, and capacities of cell invasion and migration were detected by cell invasion and migration assays. Transfection with Mina53 siRNA significantly repress the proliferation of SGC7901 and AGS cells with a relative proliferation rate of 60% and 68% (96 h), respectively; knocking down Mina53 also arrested the cell cycle at G1 phase (G1/G2 ratio in SGC7901 cells: 2.76±0.12 vs. 1.86±0.06, P<0.05; in AGS cells: 1.78±0.13 vs. 1.34±0.05, P<0.05) and increased the apoptosis rates of SGC7901 and AGS cells by 9.8%±1.2% and 10.6%±1.5%, respectively (P<0.05). Meanwhile, knocking down Mina53 significantly inhibited the invasion and migration of SGC7901 (invasion cells: 11.67±0.88 vs. 24.33±1.45, P<0.05; migration cells: 7.00±1.53 vs. 14.67±2.03, P<0.05) and AGS cells (invasion cells: 8.00±1.15 vs. 20.33±1.73, P<0.05; migration cells: 8.00±1.16 vs. 15.33±1.45, P<0.05) in Transwell chamber. Mina53 can regulate proliferation, cell cycle, cell apoptosis, and invasion and migration capacities of human gastric carcinoma cells, which indicates that it plays an important role in the growth, invasiveness and metastasis of gastric carcinoma and may be considered as a target of gastric carcinoma gene therapy.

84883418353	The Role of Mitochondria-Derived Reactive Oxygen Species in Hyperthermia-Induced Platelet Apoptosis	A combination of hyperthermia with radiotherapy and chemotherapy for various solid tumors has been practiced clinically. However, hyperthermic therapy has side effects, such as thrombocytopenia. Up to now, the pathogenesis of hyperthermia-induced thrombocytopenia remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that hyperthermia induces platelet apoptosis. However, the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms involved in hyperthermia-induced platelet apoptosis have not been determined. Here we show that hyperthermia induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial ROS generation in a time-dependent manner in platelets. The mitochondria-targeted ROS scavenger Mito-TEMPO blocked intracellular ROS and mitochondrial ROS generation. By contrast, inhibitors of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase did not. Furthermore, Mito-TEMPO inhibited hyperthermia-induced malonyldialdehyde production and cardiolipin peroxidation. We also showed that hyperthermia-triggered platelet apoptosis was inhibited by Mito-TEMPO. Furthermore, Mito-TEMPO ameliorated hyperthermia-impaired platelet aggregation and adhesion function. Lastly, hyperthermia decreased platelet manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) protein levels and enzyme activity. These data indicate that mitochondrial ROS play a pivotal role in hyperthermia-induced platelet apoptosis, and decreased of MnSOD activity might, at least partially account for the enhanced ROS levels in hyperthermia-treated platelets. Therefore, determining the role of mitochondrial ROS as contributory factors in platelet apoptosis, is critical in providing a rational design of novel drugs aimed at targeting mitochondrial ROS. Such therapeutic approaches would have potential clinical utility in platelet-associated disorders involving oxidative damage. © 2013 Wang et al.

0141626776	Clinical and endoscopic features of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma	Background: Primary gastric B-cell lymphomas originate from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) which is closely associated with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Endoscopy is the major method for the diagnosis of gastric MALT lymphoma in early stage. Aims: To explore the clinical and endoscopic features of gastric MALT lymphoma. Methods: The clinical, endoscopic and pathologic data of 20 patients with gastric MALT lymphoma identified by histology were analyzed. Among them, 10 were males and 10 females; the ratio of male to female was 1:1. The mean age of onset of disease was 55.6 years (21-78 years). Results: The symptoms of these 20 patients were non-specific, upper abdominal pain was most common and hunger pain, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, melena being the next. The endoscopic features were as follows: the tumor arising from the antrum was found in 5 cases, corpus 5, angulus 1, cardia 1 and multiple sites 8; the appearance was variegated, including ulcerative in 10 cases, infiltrative 3, nodular 5 and ulcerative nodular 2. The detection rate of endoscopic biopsy was very low (5%). H. pylori infection was found in 10 out of 12 patients (83.3%). Immunohistochemistry showed B-cell malignant lymphoma in all 20 patients. Conclusions: The clinical features of gastric MALT lymphoma are non-specific; the endoscopic features are variegated and the lesion is more extensive. The high prevalence rate of H. pylori infection may play an important role in the pathogenesis of gastric MALT lymphoma.

84888375902	Physical properties of gastrointestinal stromal tumors based on atomic force microscope analysis	This study was designed to detect the stiffness of single living gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) cells in vitro using an atomic force microscope as a probe tool. We determined that the stiffness of living GIST cells was 3913 Pa, the stiffness of the membrane was 642 Pa, and the stiffness of the cytoplasm was 17,550 Pa. For comparison, we also determined the stiffness of a normal stomach cell, which was 7374 Pa, and that of in vitro GIST cells after 2 h of exposure, which was 10,680 Pa. Measuring the mechanical properties of individual GIST cells might provide more complementary information for the diagnosis and treatment of GISTs from the perspective of physical characteristics. © FUNPEC-RP.

84892505619	Advances in study on adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction	Adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction (AEG) located in the esophageal and gastric transitional zone. So far, there was no unified classification for AEG, the Siewert classification which is based on anatomy is being accepted by clinicians. The main pathogenesis of AEG includes the Barrett's esophagus pathway and gastric pathway. Surgery is the main treatment modality, neo-adjuvant therapy may probably improve the prognosis and gene targeted therapy offers a new approach to treat AEG. Now, there are incongruities in studies on AEG between western and eastern countries. The etiology, clinicopathology, molecular biology and management of AEG deserve further study. This article reviewed the advances in study on AEG.

84892650541	Morphological manifestations and diagnostic experiences of early gastric cancer	Gastric mucosa biopsy is the most effective diagnostic means for early gastric cancer (EGC), especially the minimum cancer. The macroscopic morphology of EGC is often not typical, such as gastritis-like cancer, tiny gastric cancer, small or sheet erosion, polyp canceration and pseudo-healing. And it is more difficult to judge its benign or malignant nature under the gastroscope. The proportion of such kinds of EGC is increasing gradually in recent years. Also, with the wide application of proton pump inhibitors, part of EGC lesions demonstrate pseudo-healing, which increases the diagnostic difficulty and make some patients hard to be identified by repeated biopsy, thus delaying the treatment timing. Mucus staining is helpful for the pathologic diagnosis of EGC, especially when few cancer cells are presented in the biopsy specimens. This article reviewed the detailed morphological manifestations and diagnostic experiences of EGC.

84892412486	Mina53, a novel molecular marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma	Mina53 is a direct novel target protein of Myc. The present study investigated the expression of mina53 and c-myc in gastric carcinoma and the relationship between Mina53 expression and clinicopathological features. The expression levels of mina53 and c -myc mRNA and protein in gastric cancers and the adjacent normal tissues from 12 patients were assessed by laser-capture microdissection (LCM) combined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to evaluate the expression of the Mina53 protein in normal gastric tissues (n=30), chronic atrophic gastritis without intestinal metaplasia (n=44), intestinal metaplasia (n=34), gastric dysplasia (n=36), intestinal-type gastric carcinoma (IGC) (n=30) and diffuse-type gastric carcinoma (DGC) (n=34). The correlation between expression of mina53 and patient survival time was also investigated. The expression levels of mina53 and c-myc mRNA in the gastric carcinomas were found to be higher when compared to these levels in the adjacent normal tissues. In addition, the expression levels of Mina53 and c-Myc protein in gastric carcinomas were higher when compared with levels in the adjacent normal epithelium. mina53 expression was significantly increased during gastric carcinogenesis and was correlated with different clinicopathological factors in IGC and DGC. The prognosis of patients with low expression of Mina53 was more favorable when compared to the prognosis of patients with high expression of Mina53. mina53 expression was gradually elevated during gastric carcinogenesis, and the overexpression of mina53 was correlated with different clinicopathological features between DGC and IGC cases. Furthermore, the prognosis of gastric carcinoma patients was significantly correlated with the expression of Mina53.
