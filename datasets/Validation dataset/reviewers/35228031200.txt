26944436705	Production of i mesons at midrapidity in sNN=200GeVAu+Au collisions at relativistic energies	We present the results of I meson production in the K+K- decay channel from Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV as measured at midrapidity by the PHENIX detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Precision resonance centroid and width values are extracted as a function of collision centrality. No significant variation from the Particle Data Group accepted values is observed, contrary to some model predictions. The I transverse mass spectra are fitted with a linear exponential function for which the derived inverse slope parameter is seen to be constant as a function of centrality. However, when these data are fitted by a hydrodynamic model the result is that the centrality-dependent freeze-out temperature and the expansion velocity values are consistent with the values previously derived from fitting identified charged hadron data. As a function of transverse momentum the collisions scaled peripheral-to-central yield ratio RCP for the I is comparable to that of pions rather than that of protons. This result lends support to theoretical models that distinguish between baryons and mesons instead of particle mass for explaining the anomalous (anti) proton yield. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

26944449335	Measurement of single electron event anisotropy in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	The transverse momentum dependence of the azimuthal anisotropy parameter v2, the second harmonic of the azimuthal distribution, for electrons at midrapidity (|η|<0.35) has been measured with the PHENIX detector in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The measurement was made with respect to the reaction plane defined at high rapidities (|η|=3.1-3.9). From the result we have measured the v2 of electrons from heavy flavor decay after subtraction of the v2 of electrons from other sources such as photon conversions and Dalitz decay from light neutral mesons. We observe a nonzero single electron v2 with a 90% confidence level in the intermediate-pT region. The precision of the present data set does not permit us to conclude definitively that heavy quarks exhibit thermalization with the transverse flow of the bulk matter. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

27144460964	Jet structure of baryon excess in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	Two particle correlations between identified meson and baryon trigger particles with 2.5<pT<4.0GeV/c and lower pT charged hadrons have been measured at midrapidity by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in p+p,d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV. In noncentral Au+Au collisions, the probability of finding a hadron near in azimuthal angle to the trigger particles is almost identical for mesons and baryons and significantly higher than in p+p collisions. The associated yields for trigger baryons decrease in the most central collisions, consistent with some baryon production by thermal recombination in addition to hard scattering. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

3042763768	PHENIX detector overview	The PHENIX detector is designed to perform a broad study of A-A, p-A, and p-p collisions to investigate nuclear matter under extreme conditions. A wide variety of probes, sensitive to all timescales, are used to study systematic variations with species and energy as well as to measure the spin structure of the nucleon. Designing for the needs of the heavy-ion and polarized-proton programs has produced a detector with unparalleled capabilities. PHENIX measures electron and muon pairs, photons, and hadrons with excellent energy and momentum resolution. The detector consists of a large number of subsystems that are discussed in other papers in this volume. The overall design parameters of the detector are presented. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

32644459714	Measurement of identified π0 and inclusive photon second-harmonic parameter v2 and implications for direct photon production in sNN=200GeV Au+Au	The azimuthal distribution of identified π0 and inclusive photons has been measured in sNN=200GeV Au+Au collisions with the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). The second-harmonic parameter (v2) was measured to describe the observed anisotropy of the azimuthal distribution. The measured inclusive photon v2 is consistent with the value expected for the photons from hadron decay and is also consistent with the lack of direct photon signal over the measured pT range 1-6GeV/c. An attempt is made to extract v2 of direct photons. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

32644465770	J/ψ production and nuclear effects for d+Au and p+p collisions at sNN=200GeV	J/ψ production in d+Au and p+p collisions at sNN=200GeV has been measured by the PHENIX experiment at rapidities -2.2<y<+2.4. The cross sections and nuclear dependence of J/ψ production versus rapidity, transverse momentum, and centrality are obtained and compared to lower energy p+A results and to theoretical models. The observed nuclear dependence in d+Au collisions is found to be modest, suggesting that the absorption in the final state is weak and the shadowing of the gluon distributions is small and consistent with Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi-based parametrizations that fit deep-inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan data at lower energies. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The contribution to the inclusive electron spectrum from semileptonic decays of hadrons carrying heavy flavor, i.e., charm quarks or, at high pT, bottom quarks, is determined via three independent methods. The resulting electron spectrum from heavy-flavor decays is compared to recent leading and next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations.

Contributions from photon conversions and from light hadron decays, mainly Dalitz decays of π0 and η mesons, were removed. The resulting nonphotonic electron spectra are primarily due to the semileptonic decays of hadrons carrying heavy quarks. Nuclear modification factors were determined by comparison to nonphotonic electrons in p+p collisions. A significant suppression of electrons at high pT is observed in central Au+Au collisions, indicating substantial energy loss of heavy quarks. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33745032617	Azimuthal angle correlations for rapidity separated hadron pairs in d+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	Deuteron-gold (d+Au) collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider provide ideal platforms for testing QCD theories in dense nuclear matter at high energy. In particular, models suggesting strong saturation effects for partons carrying small nucleon momentum fraction (x) predict modifications to jet production at forward rapidity (deuteron-going direction) in d+Au collisions. We report on two-particle azimuthal angle correlations between charged hadrons at forward/backward (deuteron/gold going direction) rapidity and charged hadrons at midrapidity in d+Au and p+p collisions at sNN=200GeV. Jet structures observed in the correlations are quantified in terms of the conditional yield and angular width of away-side partners. The kinematic region studied here samples partons in the gold nucleus with x∼0.1 to ∼0.01. Within this range, we find no x dependence of the jet structure in d+Au collisions. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646375715	Double-hadron leptoproduction in the nuclear medium	The first measurements of double-hadron production in deep-inelastic scattering within the nuclear medium were made with the HERMES spectrometer at DESY HERA using a 27.6 GeV positron beam. By comparing data for deuterium, nitrogen, krypton, and xenon nuclei, the influence of the nuclear medium on the ratio of double-hadron to single-hadron yields was investigated. Nuclear effects on the additional hadron are clearly observed, but with little or no difference among nitrogen, krypton, or xenon, and with smaller magnitude than effects seen on previously measured single-hadron multiplicities. The data are compared with models based on partonic energy loss or prehadronic scattering and with a model based on a purely absorptive treatment of the final-state interactions. Thus, the double-hadron ratio provides an additional tool for studying modifications of hadronization in nuclear matter. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646881501	Improved measurement of double helicity asymmetry in inclulsive midrapidity π0 production for polarized p+p collisions at s=200GeV	We present an improved measurement of the double helicity asymmetry for π0 production in polarized proton-proton scattering at s=200GeV employing the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The improvements to our previous measurement come from two main factors: Inclusion of a new data set from the 2004 RHIC run with higher beam polarizations than the earlier run and a recalibration of the beam polarization measurements for the earlier run, which resulted in reduced uncertainties and increased beam polarizations. The results are compared to a Next to Leading Order (NLO) perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) calculation with a range of polarized gluon distributions. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646471080	Jet structure from dihadron correlations in d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	Dihadron correlations at high transverse momentum pT in d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV at midrapidity are measured by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. From these correlations, we extract several structural characteristics of jets: the root-mean-squared transverse momentum of fragmenting hadrons with respect to the jet jT2, the mean sine-squared of the azimuthal angle between the jet axes sin2 jj, and the number of particles produced within the dijet that are associated with a high-pT particle (dN/dxE distributions). We observe that the fragmentation characteristics of jets in d+Au collisions are very similar to those in p+p collisions and that there is little dependence on the centrality of the d+Au collision. This is consistent with the nuclear medium having little influence on the fragmentation process. Furthermore, there is no statistically significant increase in the value of sin2 jj from p+p to d+Au collisions. This constrains the effect of multiple scattering that partons undergo in the cold nuclear medium before and after a hard collision. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646801573	Common suppression pattern of η and π0 mesons at high transverse momentum in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	Inclusive transverse momentum spectra of η mesons have been measured within pT=2-10GeV/c at midrapidity by the PHENIX experiment in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV. In central Au+Au the η yields are significantly suppressed compared to peripheral Au+Au, d+Au, and p+p yields scaled by the corresponding number of nucleon-nucleon collisions. The magnitude, centrality, and pT dependence of the suppression is common, within errors, for η and π0. The ratio of η to π0 spectra at high pT amounts to 0.40<Rη/ π0<0.48 for the three systems, in agreement with the world average measured in hadronic and nuclear reactions and, at large scaled momentum, in e+e- collisions. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33747343691	Nuclear effects on hadron production in d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV revealed by comparison with p+p data	PHENIX has measured the centrality dependence of midrapidity pion, kaon, and proton transverse momentum distributions in d+Au and p+p collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The p+p data provide a reference for nuclear effects in d+Au and previously measured Au+Au collisions. Hadron production is enhanced in d+Au, relative to independent nucleon-nucleon scattering, as was observed in lower energy collisions. The nuclear modification factor for (anti)protons is larger than that for pions. The difference increases with centrality but is not sufficient to account for the abundance of baryon production observed in central Au+Au collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The centrality dependence in d+Au shows that the nuclear modification factor increases gradually with the number of collisions encountered by each participant nucleon. We also present comparisons with lower energy data as well as with parton recombination and other theoretical models of nuclear effects on particle production. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33749465590	Jet properties from dihadron correlations in p+p collisions at s=200GeV	The properties of jets produced in p+p collisions at s=200GeV are measured using the method of two-particle correlations. The trigger particle is a leading particle from a large transverse momentum jet while the associated particle comes from either the same jet or the away-side jet. Analysis of the angular width of the near-side peak in the correlation function determines the jet-fragmentation transverse momentum jT. The extracted value, jT2 =585±6(stat)±15(sys)MeV/c, is constant with respect to the trigger particle transverse momentum, and comparable to the previous lower s measurements. The width of the away-side peak is shown to be a convolution of jT with the fragmentation variable, z, and the partonic transverse momentum, kT. The z is determined through a combined analysis of the measured π0 inclusive and associated spectra using jet-fragmentation functions measured in e+e- collisions. The final extracted values of kT are then determined to also be independent of the trigger particle transverse momentum, over the range measured, with value of kT2 =2.68±0.07(stat)±0.34(sys)GeV/c. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Two independent methods have been used to determine the heavy-flavor yields, and the results are in good agreement with each other. A fixed-order-plus-next-to-leading-log perturbative QCD calculation agrees with the data within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties, with the data/theory ratio of 1.71±0.02stat±0.18sys for 0.3<pT<9GeV/c.

The data were collected at the HERMES experiment at DESY, in deep-inelastic scattering of 27.6 GeV longitudinally polarized positrons off longitudinally polarized hydrogen and deuterium gas targets internal to the HERA storage ring. The neutron spin structure function g1n is extracted by combining proton and deuteron data. The integrals of g1p,d at Q2=5GeV2 are evaluated over the measured x range. Neglecting any possible contribution to the g1d integral from the region x≤0.021, a value of 0.330±0.011(theo)±0.025(exp)±0. 028(evol) is obtained for the flavor-singlet axial charge a0 in a leading-twist next-to-next-to-leading-order analysis. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

33846520040	Beam-charge azimuthal asymmetry and deeply virtual Compton scattering	The first observation of an azimuthal cross section asymmetry with respect to the charge of the incoming lepton beam is reported from a study of hard exclusive electroproduction of real photons. The data have been accumulated by the HERMES experiment at DESY, in which the HERA 27.6 GeV electron or positron beam scattered off an unpolarized hydrogen gas target. The observed asymmetry is attributed to the interference between the Bethe-Heitler process and the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) process. The interference term is sensitive to DVCS amplitudes, which provide the most direct access to generalized parton distributions. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

33847405312	High transverse momentum η meson production in p+p,d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	Inclusive transverse momentum spectra of η mesons in the range pTf2-12 GeV/c have been measured at midrapidity (|η|<0.35) by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in p+p,d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The η mesons are reconstructed through their η→γγ channel for the three colliding systems as well as through the η→π0π+π- decay mode in p+p and d+Au collisions. The nuclear modification factor in d+Au collisions, RdAu(pT)1.0-1.1, suggests at most only modest pT broadening ("Cronin enhancement"). In central Au+Au reactions, the η yields are significantly suppressed, with RAuAu(pT)0.2. The ratio of η to π0 yields is approximately constant as a function of pT for the three colliding systems in agreement with the high-pT world average of Rη/π00.5 in hadron-hadron, hadron-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus collisions for a wide range of center-of-mass energies (sNN3-1800 GeV) as well as, for high scaled momentum xp, in e+e- annihilations at s=91.2 GeV. These results are consistent with a scenario where high-pT η production in nuclear collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider is largely unaffected by initial-state effects but where light-quark mesons (π0,η) are equally suppressed due to final-state interactions of the parent partons in the dense medium produced in Au+Au reactions. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34247106189	Scaling properties of azimuthal anisotropy in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200GeV	Differential measurements of elliptic flow (v2) for Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200GeV are used to test and validate predictions from perfect fluid hydrodynamics for scaling of v2 with eccentricity, system size, and transverse kinetic energy (KET). For KETmT-m up to ∼1GeV the scaling is compatible with hydrodynamic expansion of a thermalized fluid. For large values of KET mesons and baryons scale separately. Quark number scaling reveals a universal scaling of v2 for both mesons and baryons over the full KET range for Au+Au. For Au+Au and Cu+Cu the scaling is more pronounced in terms of KET, rather than transverse momentum. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The measured yields are compared to those in p+p collisions at the same sNN scaled by the number of underlying nucleon-nucleon collisions in d+Au. At all centralities, the yield ratios show no suppression, in contrast to the strong suppression seen for central Au+Au collisions at RHIC. Only a weak pT and centrality dependence can be observed. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The away-side dijet induced azimuthal correlation is broadened, non-Gaussian, and peaked away from Δ =π in central and semicentral collisions in all the systems. The broadening and peak location are found to depend upon the number of participants in the collision, but not on the collision energy or beam nuclei. These results are consistent with sound or shock wave models, but pose challenges to Cherenkov gluon radiation models. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

Measurements in two decay channels (ω→π0π+π- and ω→π 0γ) yield consistent results, and the reconstructed ω mass agrees with the accepted value within the pT range of the measurements.

The extracted αξ parameter, related to the susceptibility of the density fluctuations in the long-wavelength limit, exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior as a function of the number of participant nucleons, Npart. A local maximum is seen at Npart~90, with corresponding energy density based on the Bjorken picture of εBjτ~2.4 GeV/(fm2c) with a transverse area size of 60 fm2.

34848881889	Detailed study of high-pT neutral pion suppression and azimuthal anisotropy in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	Measurements of neutral pion (π0) production at midrapidity in sNN=200 GeV Au+Au collisions as a function of transverse momentum, pT, collision centrality, and angle with respect to reaction plane are presented. The data represent the final π0 results from the PHENIX experiment for the first RHIC Au+Au run at design center-of-mass energy. They include additional data obtained using the PHENIX Level-2 trigger with more than a factor of 3 increase in statistics over previously published results for pT>6 GeV/c. We evaluate the suppression in the yield of high-pT π0's relative to pointlike scaling expectations using the nuclear modification factor RAA. We present the pT dependence of RAA for nine bins in collision centrality. We separately integrate RAA over larger pT bins to show more precisely the centrality dependence of the high-pT suppression. We then evaluate the dependence of the high-pT suppression on the emission angle Δ of the pions with respect to event reaction plane for seven bins in collision centrality. We show that the yields of high-pT π0's vary strongly with Δ, consistent with prior measurements. We show that this variation persists in the most peripheral bin accessible in this analysis. For the peripheral bins we observe no suppression for neutral pions produced aligned with the reaction plane, whereas the yield of π0's produced perpendicular to the reaction plane is suppressed by a factor of ~2. We analyze the combined centrality and Δ dependence of the π0 suppression in different pT bins using different possible descriptions of parton energy loss dependence on jet path-length averages to determine whether a single geometric picture can explain the observed suppression pattern. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34848889574	Inclusive cross section and double helicity asymmetry for π0 production in p+p collisions at s=200GeV: Implications for the polarized gluon distribution in the proton	The PHENIX experiment presents results from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider 2005 run with polarized proton collisions at s=200GeV, for inclusive π0 production at midrapidity. Unpolarized cross section results are given for transverse momenta pT=0.5 to 20GeV/c, extending the range of published data to both lower and higher pT. The cross section is described well for pT<1GeV/c by an exponential in pT, and, for pT>2GeV/c, by perturbative QCD. Double helicity asymmetries ALL are presented based on a factor of 5 improvement in uncertainties as compared to previously published results, due to both an improved beam polarization of 50%, and to higher integrated luminosity. These measurements are sensitive to the gluon polarization in the proton. Using one representative model of gluon polarization it is demonstrated that the gluon spin contribution to the proton spin is significantly constrained. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

36148948687	Measurement of single muons at forward rapidity in p+p collisions at s=200GeV and implications for charm production	Muon production at forward rapidity (1.5≤|η|≤1.8) has been measured by the PHENIX experiment over the transverse momentum range 1≤pT≤3GeV/c in s=200GeV p+p collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. After statistically subtracting contributions from light hadron decays an excess remains which is attributed to the semileptonic decays of hadrons carrying heavy flavor, i.e. charm quarks or, at high pT, bottom quarks. The resulting muon spectrum from heavy flavor decays is compared to PYTHIA and a next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculation. PYTHIA is used to determine the charm quark spectrum that would produce the observed muon excess. The corresponding differential cross section for charm quark production at forward rapidity is determined to be dσcc̄/dy|y=1.6=0.243±0.013(stat.) ±0.105(datasyst.)+0.049-0.087(PYTHIAsyst.)mb. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

38049091925	Transverse momentum and centrality dependence of dihadron correlations in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV: Jet quenching and the response of partonic matter	Azimuthal angle (Δ) correlations are presented for charged hadrons from dijets for 0.4<pT<10 GeV/c in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. With increasing pT, the away-side distribution evolves from a broad and relatively flat shape to a concave shape, then to a convex shape. Comparisons to p+p data suggest that the away-side can be divided into a partially suppressed "head" region centered at Δ∼π and an enhanced "shoulder" region centered at Δ∼π±1.1. The pT spectrum for the head region softens toward central collisions, consistent with the onset of jet quenching. The spectral slope for the shoulder region is independent of centrality and trigger pT, which offers constraints on energy transport mechanisms and suggests that it contains the medium response to energetic jets. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

Nucleon-gold collisions were selected by tagging events in which a spectator nucleon was observed in one of two forward rapidity detectors. The spectra and yields were investigated as a function of the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, ν, suffered by deuteron nucleons. A comparison of charged particle yields to those in p+p collisions show that yield per nucleon-nucleon collision saturates with ν for high momentum particles.

34247400755	Energy loss and flow of heavy quarks in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	The PHENIX experiment at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has measured electrons with 0.3<pT<9GeV/c at midrapidity (|y|<0.35) from heavy-flavor (charm and bottom) decays in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV. The nuclear modification factor RAA relative to p+p collisions shows a strong suppression in central Au+Au collisions, indicating substantial energy loss of heavy quarks in the medium produced at RHIC energies. A large azimuthal anisotropy v2 with respect to the reaction plane is observed for 0.5<pT<5GeV/c indicating substantial heavy-flavor elliptic flow. Both RAA and v2 show a pT dependence different from those of neutral pions. A comparison to transport models which simultaneously describe RAA(pT) and v2(pT) suggests that the viscosity to entropy density ratio is close to the conjectured quantum lower bound, i.e., near a perfect fluid. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

41249103994	Cold nuclear matter effects on J/ψ production as constrained by deuteron-gold measurements at sNN=200 GeV	We present a new analysis of J/ψ production yields in deuteron-gold collisions at sNN=200 GeV using data taken from the PHENIX experiment in 2003 and previously published in S. S. Adler [Phys. Rev. Lett 96, 012304 (2006)]. The high statistics proton-proton J/ψ data taken in 2005 are used to improve the baseline measurement and thus construct updated cold nuclear matter modification factors (RdAu). A suppression of J/ψ in cold nuclear matter is observed as one goes forward in rapidity (in the deuteron-going direction), corresponding to a region more sensitive to initial-state low-x gluons in the gold nucleus. The measured nuclear modification factors are compared to theoretical calculations of nuclear shadowing to which a J/ψ (or precursor) breakup cross section is added. Breakup cross sections of σbreakup=2.8-1. 4+1.7 (2.2-1.5+1.6) mb are obtained by fitting these calculations to the data using two different models of nuclear shadowing. These breakup cross-section values are consistent within large uncertainties with the 4.2±0.5 mb determined at lower collision energies.

79952292228	Leading-order determination of the gluon polarization from high-pT hadron electroproduction	Longitudinal double-spin asymmetries of charged hadrons with high transverse momentum pT have been measured in electroproduction using the Hermes detector at Hera. Processes involving gluons in the nucleon have been enhanced relative to others by selecting hadrons with pT typically above 1GeV. In this kinematic domain the gluon polarization has been extracted in leading order making use of the model embedded in the Monte Carlo Generator Pythia 6.2. The gluon polarization obtained from single inclusive hadrons in the pT range 1GeV < pT < 2.5GeV using a deuterium target is δg/g(〈x,〉, 〈μ〉) = 0.049 ± 0.034(stat) ± 0.010(sys-exp)

79952301840	Cross section and double helicity asymmetry for η mesons and their comparison to π0 production in p+p collisions at √s=200GeV	Measurements of double-helicity asymmetries in inclusive hadron production in polarized p+p collisions are sensitive to helicity-dependent parton distribution functions, in particular, to the gluon helicity distribution, Δg. This study focuses on the extraction of the double-helicity asymmetry in η production (p→+p→→η+X), the η cross section, and the η/π0 cross section ratio. The cross section and ratio measurements provide essential input for the extraction of fragmentation functions that are needed to access the helicity-dependent parton distribution functions. © 2011 American Physical Society.

80052964372	Measurement of double-spin asymmetries associated with deeply virtual Compton scattering on a transversely polarized hydrogen target	Double-spin asymmetries in exclusive electroproduction of real photons from a transversely polarized hydrogen target are measured with respect to the product of target polarization with beam helicity and beam charge, and with respect to the product of target polarization with beam helicity alone. The asymmetries arise from the deeply virtual Compton scattering process and its interference with the Bethe-Heitler process. They are related to the real part of the same combination of Compton form factors as that determining the previously published transverse target single-spin asymmetries through the imaginary part. The results for the double-spin asymmetries are found to be compatible with zero within the uncertainties of the measurement, and are not incompatible with the predictions of the only available GPD-based calculation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is performed using a 980fb-1 data sample collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. We search for doubly charmed baryons Ξcc+(+) with the Λc+K-π+(π+) and Ξc0π+(π+) final states. No significant signal is observed. We also search for two excited charmed strange baryons, Ξc(3055)+ and Ξc(3123)+ with the Σc++(2455)K- and Σc++(2520)K- final states. The Ξc(3055)+ signal is observed with a significance of 6.6 standard deviations including systematic uncertainty, while no signature of the Ξc(3123)+ is seen.

46349083491	Quantitative constraints on the transport properties of hot partonic matter from semi-inclusive single high transverse momentum pion suppression in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	The PHENIX experiment has measured the suppression of semi-inclusive single high-transverse-momentum π0's in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The present understanding of this suppression is in terms of energy loss of the parent (fragmenting) parton in a dense color-charge medium. We have performed a quantitative comparison between various parton energy-loss models and our experimental data. The statistical point-to-point uncorrelated as well as correlated systematic uncertainties are taken into account in the comparison. We detail this methodology and the resulting constraint on the model parameters, such as the initial color-charge density dNg/dy, the medium transport coefficient q, or the initial energy-loss parameter ε0. We find that high-transverse-momentum π0 suppression in Au+Au collisions has sufficient precision to constrain these model-dependent parameters at the ±20-25% (one standard deviation) level. These constraints include only the experimental uncertainties, and further studies are needed to compute the corresponding theoretical uncertainties. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

4544369185	Hard exclusive electroproduction of π	Hard exclusive electroproduction of π+π- pairs off hydrogen and deuterium targets has been studied by the HERMES experiment at DESY. Legendre moments 〈P1〉 and 〈P3〉 of the angular distributions of π+ mesons in the center-of-mass frame of the pair have been measured for the first time. Their dependence on the π+π- invariant mass can be understood as being due to the interference between relative P-wave (isovector) and S-, D-wave (isoscalar) states of the two pions. The increase in magnitude of 〈P1〉 as Bjorken x increases is interpreted in the framework of generalized parton distributions as an enhancement of flavour non-singlet qq̄ exchange for larger values of x, which leads to a sizable admixture of isoscalar and isovector pion pairs. In addition, the interference between P-wave and D-wave states separately for transverse and longitudinal pion pairs has been studied. The data indicate that in the f2(1270) region at 〈Q2〉=3 GeV2 higher-twist effects can be as large as the leading-twist longitudinal component. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

47149098083	Dihadron azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	Azimuthal angle (Δ) correlations are presented for a broad range of transverse momentum (0.4<pT<10 GeV/c) and centrality (0-92%) selections for charged hadrons from dijets in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. With increasing pT, the away-side Δ distribution evolves from a broad and relatively flat shape to a concave shape, then to a convex shape. Comparisons with p+p data suggest that the away-side distribution can be divided into a partially suppressed "head" region centered at Δ~π, and an enhanced "shoulder" region centered at Δ~π±1.1. The pT spectrum for the associated hadrons in the head region softens toward central collisions. The spectral slope for the shoulder region is independent of centrality and trigger pT. The properties of the near-side distributions are also modified relative to those in p+p collisions, reflected by the broadening of the jet shape in Δ and Δη, and an enhancement of the per-trigger yield. However, these modifications seem to be limited to pT4 GeV/c, above which both the hadron pair shape and per-trigger yield become similar to p+p collisions. These observations suggest that both the away- and near-side distributions contain a jet fragmentation component which dominates for pT5 GeV/c and a medium-induced component which is important for pT4 GeV/c. We also quantify the role of jets at intermediate and low pT through the yield of jet-induced pairs in comparison with binary scaled p+p pair yield. The yield of jet-induced pairs is suppressed at high pair proxy energy (sum of the pT magnitudes of the two hadrons) and is enhanced at low pair proxy energy. The former is consistent with jet quenching; the latter is consistent with the enhancement of soft hadron pairs due to transport of lost energy to lower pT. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

47249146468	Measurement of azimuthal asymmetries with respect to both beam charge and transverse target polarization in exclusive electroproduction of real photons	Azimuthal asymmetries in exclusive electroproduction of real photons are measured for the first time with respect to transverse target polarisation, providing new constraints on Generalized Parton Distributions. From the same data set on a hydrogen target, new results for the beam-charge asymmetry are also extracted with better precision than those previously reported. By comparing model calculations with measured asymmetries attributed to the interference between the deeply virtual Compton scattering and Bethe-Heitler processes, a model-dependent constraint is obtained on the total angular momenta carried by up and down quarks in the nucleon.

Relative to π0 yields in p+p collisions scaled by the number of inelastic nucleon-nucleon collisions (Ncoll) the π0 yields for pT □2GeV/c in central Cu+Cu collisions are suppressed at 62.4 and 200 GeV whereas an enhancement is observed at 22.4 GeV. A comparison with a jet-quenching model suggests that final state parton energy loss dominates in central Cu+Cu collisions at 62.4 and 200 GeV, while the enhancement at 22.4 GeV is consistent with nuclear modifications in the initial state alone. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

54049132456	Charged hadron multiplicity fluctuations in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions from sNN=22.5 to 200 GeV	A comprehensive survey of event-by-event fluctuations of charged hadron multiplicity in relativistic heavy ions is presented. The survey covers Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 and 200 GeV, and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=22.5,62.4, and 200 GeV. Fluctuations are measured as a function of collision centrality, transverse momentum range, and charge sign. After correcting for nondynamical fluctuations due to fluctuations in the collision geometry within a centrality bin, the remaining dynamical fluctuations expressed as the variance normalized by the mean tend to decrease with increasing centrality. The dynamical fluctuations are consistent with or below the expectation from a superposition of participant nucleon-nucleon collisions based upon p+p data, indicating that this dataset does not exhibit evidence of critical behavior in terms of the compressibility of the system. A comparison of the data with a model where hadrons are independently emitted from a number of hadron clusters suggests that the mean number of hadrons per cluster is small in heavy ion collisions. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

A fivefold suppression is found, which is essentially constant for 5<pT<20GeV/c. Experimental uncertainties are small enough to constrain any model-dependent parametrization for the transport coefficient of the medium, e.g., □□ in the parton quenching model. The spectral shape is similar for all collision classes, and the suppression does not saturate in Au+Au collisions. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

Unpolarized cross section results are measured for transverse momenta pT=0.5 to 7GeV/c. Next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations are compared with the data, and while the calculations are consistent with the measurements, next-to-leading logarithmic corrections improve the agreement. Double helicity asymmetries ALL are presented for pT=1 to 4GeV/c and probe the higher range of Bjorken x of the gluon (xg) with better statistical precision than our previous measurements at s=200GeV.

Measured asymmetries are consistent with zero, and at a theory scale of μ2=4GeV2 a next to leading order QCD analysis gives ΔG[0.02,0.3]=0.2, with a constraint of -0.7<ΔG[0. 02,0.3]<0.5 at Δχ2=9 (∼3σ) for the sampled gluon momentum fraction (x) range, 0.02 to 0.3. The results are obtained using predictions for the measured asymmetries generated from four representative fits to polarized deep inelastic scattering data. We also consider the dependence of the ΔG constraint on the choice of the theoretical scale, a dominant uncertainty in these predictions. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The ratio of the yield of electrons from bottom to that from charm is presented. The ratio is determined using partial D/D̄→e±K X (K unidentified) reconstruction. It is found that the yield of electrons from bottom becomes significant above 4GeV/c in pT.

70349124227	Photon-hadron jet correlations in p+p and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	We report the observation at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider of suppression of back-to-back correlations in the direct photon+jet channel in Au+Au relative to p+p collisions. Two-particle correlations of direct photon triggers with associated hadrons are obtained by statistical subtraction of the decay photon-hadron (γ-h) background. The initial momentum of the away-side parton is tightly constrained, because the parton-photon pair exactly balance in momentum at leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics, making such correlations a powerful probe of the in-medium parton energy loss. The away-side nuclear suppression factor, IAA, in central Au+Au collisions, is 0.32±0.12stat±0.09syst for hadrons of 3<pTh<5 in coincidence with photons of 5<pTγ<15 GeV/c. The suppression is comparable to that observed for high-pT single hadrons and dihadrons. The direct photon associated yields in p+p collisions scale approximately with the momentum balance, zT pTh/pTγ, as expected for a measurement of the away-side parton fragmentation function. We compare to Au+Au collisions for which the momentum balance dependence of the nuclear modification should be sensitive to the path-length dependence of parton energy loss. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

They appear in the distribution of these photons in the azimuthal angle φ{symbol} around the virtual-photon direction, relative to the lepton scattering plane. The extracted asymmetries are attributed to either the deeply virtual Compton scattering process or its interference with the Bethe-Heitler process. They are compared with earlier results on the proton target. In the measured kinematic region, the beam-charge asymmetry amplitudes and the leading amplitudes of the beam-helicity asymmetries on an unpolarized deuteron target are compatible with the results from unpolarized protons. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

77649125267	Double-helicity dependence of jet properties from dihadrons in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at √s=200GeV	It has been postulated that partonic orbital angular momentum can lead to a significant double-helicity dependence in the net transverse momentum of Drell-Yan dileptons produced in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions. Analogous effects are also expected for dijet production. If confirmed by experiment, this hypothesis, which is based on semiclassical arguments, could lead to a new approach for studying the contributions of orbital angular momentum to the proton spin. We report the first measurement of the double-helicity dependence of the dijet transverse momentum in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at √s=200GeV from data taken by the PHENIX experiment in 2005 and 2006. The analysis deduces the transverse momentum of the dijet from the widths of the near- and far-side peaks in the azimuthal correlation of the dihadrons. When averaged over the transverse momentum of the triggered particle, the difference of the root mean square of the dijet transverse momentum between like- and unlike-helicity collisions is found to be -37±88stat±14systMeV/c. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

The observed beam-charge and beam-helicity asymmetries are attributed to the interference between the Bethe-Heitler and the deeply virtual Compton scattering processes. For various nuclei, the asymmetries are extracted for both coherent and incoherent-enriched regions, which involve different (combinations of) generalized parton distributions. For both regions, the asymmetries are compared to those for a free proton, and no nuclear-mass dependence is found. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

77953741186	Transition in yield and azimuthal shape modification in dihadron correlations in relativistic heavy ion collisions	Hard-scattered parton probes produced in collisions of large nuclei indicate large partonic energy loss, possibly with collective produced-medium response to the lost energy. We present measurements of π0 trigger particles at transverse momenta pTt=4-12GeV/c and associated charged hadrons (pTa=0.5-7GeV/c) vs relative azimuthal angle Δφ in Au+Au and p+p collisions at √sNN=200GeV. The Au+Au distribution at low pTa, whose shape has been interpreted as a medium effect, is modified for pTt<7GeV/c. At higher pTt, the data are consistent with unmodified or very weakly modified shapes, even for the lowest measured pTa, which quantitatively challenges some medium response models. The associated yield of hadrons opposing the trigger particle in Au+Au relative to p+p (IAA) is suppressed at high pT (IAA ≈ 0.35-0.5), but less than for inclusive suppression (RAA ≈ 0.2). © 2010 The American Physical Society.

The J/ψ polarization is studied in the helicity, Gottfried-Jackson, and Collins-Soper frames for pT<5GeV/c and |y|<0.35. The polarization in the helicity and Gottfried-Jackson frames is consistent with zero for all transverse momenta, with a slight (1.8 sigma) trend towards longitudinal polarization for transverse momenta above 2GeV/c. No conclusion is allowed due to the limited acceptance in the Collins-Soper frame and the uncertainties of the current data.

They indicate nuclear modification factors (RAA) which are similar in both magnitude and trend to those found in earlier π0 measurements. Linear fits to RAA as a function of pT in 5-20 GeV/c show that the slope is consistent with zero within two standard deviations at all centralities, although a slow rise cannot be excluded. Having different statistical and systematic uncertainties, the π0 and η measurements are complementary at high pT; thus, along with the extended pT range of these data they can provide additional constraints for theoretical modeling and the extraction of transport properties. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

The dependence of the cross section on the azimuthal angles of the target polarization (ΦS) and the produced hadron (Φ) is found to have a substantial sin(Φ+ΦS) modulation for the production of π+, π- and K+. This Fourier component can be interpreted in terms of non-zero transversity distribution functions and non-zero favored and disfavored Collins fragmentation functions with opposite sign.

77957967996	Measurement of azimuthal asymmetries associated with deeply virtual Compton scattering on a longitudinally polarized deuterium target	Azimuthal asymmetries in exclusive electroproduction of a real photon from a longitudinally polarized deuterium target are measured with respect to target polarization alone and with respect to target polarization combined with beam helicity and/or beam charge. The asymmetries appear in the distribution of the real photons in the azimuthal angle around the virtual photon direction, relative to the lepton scattering plane. The asymmetries arise from the deeply virtual Compton scattering process and its interference with the Bethe-Heitler process. The results for the beam-charge and beam-helicity asymmetries from a tensor polarized deuterium target with vanishing vector polarization are shown to be compatible with those from an unpolarized deuterium target, which is expected for incoherent scattering dominant at larger momentum transfer. Furthermore, the results for the single target-spin asymmetry and for the double-spin asymmetry are found to be compatible with the corresponding asymmetries previously measured on a hydrogen target. For coherent scattering on the deuteron at small momentum transfer to the target, these findings imply that the tensor contribution to the cross section is small. Furthermore, the tensor asymmetry is found to be compatible with zero. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77957597955	Azimuthal anisotropy of π0 production in Au+Au collisions at √sNN=200GeV: Path-length dependence of jet quenching and the role of initial geometry	We have measured the azimuthal anisotropy of π0 production for 1<pT<18GeV/c for Au+Au collisions at √sNN=200GeV. The observed anisotropy shows a gradual decrease for 3pT7-10GeV/c, but remains positive beyond 10GeV/c. The magnitude of this anisotropy is underpredicted, up to at least ∼10GeV/c, by current perturbative QCD (PQCD) energy-loss model calculations. An estimate of the increase in anisotropy expected from initial-geometry modification due to gluon saturation effects and fluctuations is insufficient to account for this discrepancy. Calculations that implement a path-length dependence steeper than what is implied by current PQCD energy-loss models show reasonable agreement with the data. ©2010 The American Physical Society.

The measurement was performed over the rapidity ranges 1.2<|y|<2.2 and |y|<0.35 for transverse momenta up to 6GeV/c. J/ψ production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider is dominated by processes involving initial-state gluons, and transverse single-spin asymmetries of the J/ψ can provide access to gluon dynamics within the nucleon. Such asymmetries may also shed light on the long-standing question in QCD of the J/ψ production mechanism. Asymmetries were obtained as a function of J/ψ transverse momentum and Feynman-x, with a value of -0.086±0.026stat±0.003syst in the forward region. This result suggests possible nonzero trigluon correlation functions in transversely polarized protons and, if well defined in this reaction, a nonzero gluon Sivers distribution function. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

79960913696	Azimuthal correlations of electrons from heavy-flavor decay with hadrons in p+p and Au+Au collisions at √s	Measurements of electrons from the decay of open-heavy-flavor mesons have shown that the yields are suppressed in Au+Au collisions compared to expectations from binary-scaled p+p collisions. These measurements indicate that charm and bottom quarks interact with the hot dense matter produced in heavy-ion collisions much more than expected. Here we extend these studies to two-particle correlations where one particle is an electron from the decay of a heavy-flavor meson and the other is a charged hadron from either the decay of the heavy meson or from jet fragmentation. These measurements provide more detailed information about the interactions between heavy quarks and the matter, such as whether the modification of the away-side-jet shape seen in hadron-hadron correlations is present when the trigger particle is from heavy-meson decay and whether the overall level of away-side-jet suppression is consistent. We statistically subtract correlations of electrons arising from background sources from the inclusive electron-hadron correlations and obtain two-particle azimuthal correlations at √s

Previous measurements of this quantity for hadrons with pT < 6 GeV/c indicate that the medium behaves like a nearly perfect fluid, while for pT > 6 GeV/c a reduced anisotropy is interpreted in terms of a path-length dependence for parton energy loss. In this measurement with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider we find that for pT > 4 GeV/c the anisotropy for direct photons is consistent with zero, as expected if the dominant source of direct photons is initial hard scattering. However, in the pT < 4 GeV/c region dominated by thermal photons, we find a substantial direct photon v<inf>2</inf> comparable to that of hadrons, whereas model calculations for thermal photons in this kinematic region significantly underpredict the observed v<inf>2</inf>.

The asymmetry arises from deeply virtual Compton scattering and its interference with the Bethe-Heitler process. Azimuthal amplitudes of the beam-helicity asymmetry are extracted from a data sample consisting of ep → epγ events with detection of all particles in the final state including the recoiling proton. The installation of a recoil detector, while reducing the acceptance of the experiment, allows the elimination of background from ep → eNπγ events, which was estimated to contribute an average of about 12% to the signal in previous Hermes publications. The removal of this background from the present data sample is shown to increase the magnitude of the leading asymmetry amplitude by 0:054 ± 0:016 to - 0:328 ± 0:027 (stat:) ± 0:045 (syst:).

The ratio of v4/v22 for π0 mesons is found to be independent of pT for 1-9 GeV/c, implying a lack of sensitivity of the ratio to the change of underlying physics with pT. Furthermore, the ratio of v4/v22 is systematically larger in central collisions, which may reflect the combined effects of fluctuations in the initial collision geometry and finite viscosity in the evolving medium. © 2013 American Physical Society.

84894424324	Evidence for semileptonic B-→ pp̄ℓ- ν̄ℓ decays	We find evidence for the semileptonic baryonic decay B-→pp̄ℓ- ν̄ℓ (ℓ=e, μ), based on a data sample of 772 million BB̄ pairs collected at the Ï (4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy electron-positron collider. A neural-network based hadronic B-meson tagging method is used in this study. The branching fraction of B-→pp̄ℓ-ν̄ℓ is measured to be (5.8-2.1+2.4(stat) ±0.9(syst))×10-6 with a significance of 3.2σ, where lepton universality is assumed. We also estimate the corresponding upper limit: B(B-→pp̄ℓ-ν̄ℓ)<9.6×10-6 at the 90% confidence level. This measurement helps constrain the baryonic transition form factor in B decays. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84898810279	Heavy-flavor electron-muon correlations in p+p and d+Au collisions at sNN =200 GeV	Background: Heavy-flavor modification in relativistic p(d)+A collisions are sensitive to different kinds of strong-interaction physics ranging from modifications of the nuclear wave function to initial- and final-state energy loss. Modifications to single heavy-flavor particles and their decay leptons at midrapidity and forward rapidity are well established at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Purpose: This paper presents measurements of azimuthal correlations of electron-muon pairs produced from heavy-flavor decays, primarily cc̄, in sNN=200 GeV p+p and d+Au collision using the PHENIX detector at RHIC. The electrons are measured at midrapidity while the muons in the pair are measured at forward rapidity, defined as the direction of the deuteron beam, in order to utilize the deuteron to probe low-x partons in the gold nucleus. Methods: This analysis uses the central spectrometer arms for electron identification and forward spectrometer arms for muon identification. Azimuthal correlations are built in all sign combinations for e-μ pairs. Subtracting the like-sign yield from the unlike-sign yield removes the correlations from light flavor decays and conversions. Results: Comparing the p+p results with several different Monte Carlo event generators, we find the results are consistent with a total charm cross section σcc̄=538±46 (stat) ± 197 (data syst) ± 174 (model syst) μb. These generators also indicate that the back-to-back peak at Δφ=π is dominantly from the leading-order contributions (gluon fusion), while higher-order processes (flavor excitation and gluon splitting) contribute to the yield at all Δφ. We observe a suppression in the pair yield per collision in d+Au. We find the pair yield suppression factor for 2.7<Δφ<3.2 rad is JdA=0.433±0.087 (stat) ± 0.135 (syst). Conclusions: The e-μ pairs result from partons at xAu∼10-2 at Q2=10 GeV/c2 at the edge of the shadowing region. The pair suppression indicates modification to cc̄ pairs for these kinematics in the cold nuclear medium at RHIC. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84898603139	Measurements of branching fractions of τ lepton decays with one or more KS0	We report measurements of branching fractions of τ lepton decays to final states with a KS0 meson using a 669fb-1 data sample accumulated with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. The inclusive branching fraction is measured to be B(τ-→KS0X-ντ)=(9. 15±0.01±0.15)×10-3, where X- can be anything; the exclusive branching fractions are B(τ-→π-KS0ντ)=(4.16±0. 01±0.08)×10-3, B(τ-→K-KS0ντ)=(7.40±0. 07±0.27)×10-4, B(τ-→π-KS0π0ντ)=(1. 93±0.02±0.07)×10-3, B(τ-→K-KS0π0ντ)=(7. 48±0.10±0.37)×10-4, B(τ-→π-KS0KS0ντ)=(2. 33±0.03±0.09)×10-4, B(τ-→π-KS0KS0π0ντ) =(2.00±0.22±0.20)×10-5, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. For each mode, the accuracy is improved over that of pre-B-factory measurements by a factor ranging from five to ten. In τ-→π-KS0KS0π0ντ decays, clear signals for the intermediate states τ-→π-f1(1285)ντ and τ-→K*- KS0π0ντ are observed. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84898657716	Study of B0 →ρ0ρ0 decays, implications for the CKM angle φ2 and search for other B0 decay modes with a four-pion final state	We present a study of the branching fraction of the decay B0→ρ0ρ0 and the fraction of longitudinally polarized ρ0 mesons in this decay. The results are obtained from the final data sample containing 772×106 BB̄ pairs collected at the (4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. We find 166±59 B0→ρ0ρ0 events (including systematic uncertainties), corresponding to a branching fraction of B(B0→ρ0ρ0)=(1.02±0.30(stat) ±0.15(syst))×10-6 with a significance of 3.4 standard deviations and a longitudinal polarization fraction fL=0.21-0.22+0.18(stat)±0. 15(syst). We use the longitudinal polarization fraction to determine the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix angle φ2=(84.9±13.5)° through an isospin analysis in the B→ρρ system. We furthermore find 125±41 B0→f0ρ0 events, corresponding to B(B0→f0ρ0) ×B(f0→π+π-)=(0.78±0.22(stat)±0.11(syst)) ×10-6, with a significance of 3.1 standard deviations. We find no other significant contribution with the same final state, and set upper limits at 90% confidence level on the (product) branching fractions, B(B0→π+π- π+π-)<11.2×10-6, B(B0→ρ0π+π-)<12.0×10-6, B(B0→f0π+π-)×B(f0→π+π-)<3.0×10-6 and B(B0→f0f0)×B(f0→π+π-)2<0.2×10-6. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84899766375	Transverse-energy distributions at midrapidity in p+p, d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at s NN =62.4 -200 GeV and implications for particle-production models	Measurements of the midrapidity transverse-energy distribution, dET/dη, are presented for p+p, d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV and additionally for Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 and 130 GeV. The dET/dη distributions are first compared with the number of nucleon participants Npart, number of binary collisions Ncoll, and number of constituent-quark participants Nqp calculated from a Glauber model based on the nuclear geometry. For Au+Au, dET/d/Npart increases with Npart, while dET/d/Nqp is approximately constant for all three energies. This indicates that the two-component ansatz, dET/d (1-x)Npart/2+xNcoll, which was used to represent ET distributions, is simply a proxy for Nqp, and that the Ncoll term does not represent a hard-scattering component in ET distributions. The dET/dη distributions of Au+Au and d+Au are then calculated from the measured p+p ET distribution using two models that both reproduce the Au+Au data. However, while the number-of-constituent-quark- participant model agrees well with the d+Au data, the additive-quark model does not. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84899554538	Updated cross section measurement of e+e- →k+K-J /ψ and KS0 KS0 J /ψ via initial state radiation at Belle	The cross sections of the processes e+e-→K+K-J/ψ and KS0KS0J/ψ are measured via initial state radiation at center-of-mass energies between the threshold and 6.0 GeV using a data sample of 980fb-1 collected with the Belle detector on or near the Υ(nS) resonances, where n=1,2,...,5. The cross sections for e+e-→K+K-J/ψ are at a few pb level and the average cross section for e+e-→KS0KS0J/ψ is 1.8±0.6(stat)±0.3(syst)pb between 4.4 and 5.2 GeV. All of them are consistent with previously published results with improved precision. A search for resonant structures and associated intermediate states in the cross section of the process e+e-→K+K-J/ψ is performed. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84911214672	Measurement of KS0 and K∗0 in p+p, d+ Au, and Cu + Cu collisions at s NN =200 GeV measurement of KS0 and K∗0 in p+ ⋯ A. Adare et al.	The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has performed a systematic study of KS0 and K∗0 meson production at midrapidity in p+p,d+Au, and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The KS0 and K∗0 mesons are reconstructed via their KS0→π0(→γγ)π0(→γγ) and K∗0→K±π decay modes, respectively. The measured transverse-momentum spectra are used to determine the nuclear modification factor of KS0 and K∗0 mesons in d+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at different centralities. In the d+Au collisions, the nuclear modification factor of KS0 and K∗0 mesons is almost constant as a function of transverse momentum and is consistent with unity, showing that cold-nuclear-matter effects do not play a significant role in the measured kinematic range. In Cu+Cu collisions, within the uncertainties no nuclear modification is registered in peripheral collisions. In central collisions, both mesons show suppression relative to the expectations from the p+p yield scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions in the Cu+Cu system. In the pT range 2-5 GeV/c, the strange mesons (KS0,K∗0) similarly to the φ meson with hidden strangeness, show an intermediate suppression between the more suppressed light quark mesons (π0) and the nonsuppressed baryons (p,p¯). At higher transverse momentum, pT>5 GeV/c, production of all particles is similarly suppressed by a factor of ≈2.

84919713150	Nuclear matter effects on J/ψ production in asymmetric Cu+Au collisions at sNN =200 GeV	We report on J/ψ production from asymmetric Cu+Au heavy-ion collisions at sNN=200 GeV at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at both forward (Cu-going direction) and backward (Au-going direction) rapidities. The nuclear modification of J/ψ yields in Cu+Au collisions in the Au-going direction is found to be comparable to that in Au+Au collisions when plotted as a function of the number of participating nucleons. In the Cu-going direction, J/ψ production shows a stronger suppression. This difference is comparable in magnitude and has the same sign as the difference expected from shadowing effects due to stronger low-x gluon suppression in the larger Au nucleus.
