84948077021	Introduction to wood and natural fiber composites	Over the past two decades, there has been a shift in research and industrial practice, and products traditionally manufactured primarily from wood are increasingly combined with other nonwood materials of either natural or synthetic origin. Wood and other plant-based fiber is routinely combined with adhesives, polymers, and other "ingredients" to produce composite materials. Introduction to Wood and Natural Fiber Composites draws together widely scattered information concerning fundamental concepts and technical applications, essential to the manufacture of wood and natural fiber composites. The topics addressed include basic information on the chemical and physical composition of wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the behavior of these materials under thermocompression processes, fundamentals of adhesion, specific adhesive systems used to manufacture composite materials, and an overview of the industrial technologies used to manufacture major product categories. The book concludes with a chapter on the burgeoning field of natural fiber-plastic composites. Introduction to Wood and Natural Fiber Composites is a valuable resource for upper-level undergraduate students and graduate students studying forest products and wood science, as well as for practicing professionals working in operational areas of wood- and natural-fiber processing. For more information on the Wiley Series in Renewable Resources, visit www.wiley.com/go/rrs Topics covered include: Overview of lignocellulosic material, their chemical and physical composition. Consolidation behavior of wood and fiber in response to heat and pressure. Fundamentals of adhesion. Adhesives used to bond wood and lignocellulosic composites. Manufacturing technology of major product types. Fiber/plastic composites.

27744593098	Physical and mechanical properties of mixed comrind and hardwood oriented strandboard bonded with phenol-formaldehyde resin	Three-layer mixed comrind (CRD) and hardwood oriented strandboard (OSB) were manufactured using phenolformaldehyde (PF) resin with comrind used in the core layer. The effects of comrind and wood (face and core materials) content on panel properties were examined. The values of flake percent alignment (PA) varied from 44 to 63 percent for different types of boards. Pure comrind boards had the highest PA value among all tested panels. The density profiles through panel thickness revealed that boards with 45 percent fines in the core layer had a considerable density gradient. Generally, density gradients increased with increased fines contents in the core layer. Linear expansion and thickness swelling were improved by using comrind to replace part of the wood material in the core layer. Internal bond strength showed little decrease as CRD content increased up to 22.5 percent for boards made of core material and CRD combination in the core layer. Bending properties of the boards with wood face material and CRD combination in the core layer reduced little when the CRD content was below 22.5 percent. At lower relative humidity levels, pure CRD OSB showed lower equilibrium moisture content values compared to wood OSB for both absorption and desorption. Nelson's sorption model provided an excellent fit to the sorption data for both panel types. © Forest Products Society 2005.

32544434361	Stress-wave velocity of wood-based panels: Effect of moisture, product type, and material direction	The effect of moisture on longitudinal stress-wave velocity (SWV), bending stiffness, and bending strength of commercial oriented Strandboard, plywood, particleboard, and southern pine lumber was evaluated. It was shown that the stress-wave velocity decreased in general with increases in panel moisture content (MC). At a given MC level, SWV varied with panel type and test directions. Regression equations relating SWV to MC and bending properties (modulus of elasticity [MOE] and modulus of rupture [MOR]) were established for various products. Both MOE and MOR at different MCs can be estimated by observing the speed of propagation of a longitudinal wave. This information is useful for developing moisture correction factors on the stress-wave related properties for wood-based panel products. © Forest Products Society 2005.

33751201540	Selected properties of wood strand and oriented strandboard from small-diameter southern pine trees	Thermal and mechanical properties of southern pine and willow strands and properties of southern pine oriented strandboard (OSB) from small-diameter logs were investigated in this study. The effects of density and species group on tensile strength, dynamic moduli, and thermal stability of wood strands, and of strand quality (i.e., wood fines) on three-layer OSB properties were analyzed. Strand tensile strength and dynamic storage moduli (E′) increased with the increase of strand density. A large variation in both tensile strength and E′ values was observed for southern pine, while willow strands showed much smaller variability. The dynamic moduli (E′) of strands decreased with increase of temperature in the range of 25° to 200°C. Small loss modulus (E″) peaks were observed over the temperature range studied. The strands with higher densities had higher E″. Thermogravimetric analysis results revealed that high-density strands were thermally more stable than low-density strands. Three-layer OSB made of small-diameter southern pine trees showed satisfactory strength and dimensional stability properties. As the fines loading levels increased, linear expansion (LE) along the parallel direction decreased, while the LE value along the perpendicular direction and thickness swelling increased. With increased fines levels, the internal bond strength showed an increasing trend up to the 20% fines level, and bending strengp and modulus varied little in the parallel direction and slightly decreased in the perpendicular direction. © 2006 by the Society of Wood Science and Technology.

33847681371	The influence of fines content and panel density on properties of mixed hardwood oriented strandboard	Single- and three-layer mixed hardwood oriented strandboard (OSB) with various wood fines contents and panel densities were manufactured using phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin as binder. The effects of fines level and density on the panel properties were studied. Mathematical models based on lamination theories were used to predict properties of three-layer panels, including effective modulus (EM), linear expansion (LE), and swelling stresses using single-layer data as model input. The model's prediction was compared with actual experimental data. For single-layer panels, parallel bending modulus and strength decreased, while the perpendicular values increased as fines increased in the panels. LE and thickness swelling increased with the increase of fines contents. Regression analysis indicated that bending properties and LE were highly correlated with fines content and panel density. The results of three-layer boards with a small fixed amount of fines in the face layers showed that the bending properties varied little in the parallel direction and decreased in the perpendicular direction as fines in the core layer increased. Parallel LE decreased and the perpendicular value increased with the increase of fines in the core layer. Predicted EM and LE agreed well with the experimental data. Shifting a certain amount of fines from core to face layers led to more balanced panel properties along the two principal directions. Predicted swelling stresses decreased with the increase of fines levels in the boards. © 2007 by the Society of Wood Science and Technology.

34250359488	Tensile and thickness swelling properties of strands from Southern hardwoods and Southern pine: Effect of hot-pressing and resin application	Tensile and the moisture-induced thickness swelling properties of wood strands are among the most fundamental parameters in modeling and predicting engineering constants of strand-based composites such as oriented Strandboard (OSB). The effects of hot-pressing and resin-curing on individual strand properties were investigated in this study. Strands from four Louisiana-grown species - willow (Salix spp.), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L), red oak (Quercus spp.) and southern yellow pine (Pinus taeda L.) - were tested. It was found that the properties of strands were different from the various wood species and that hot pressing and resin-curing significantly modified the strand properties. This indicated that an adjustment of strand mechanical and swelling properties from the solid wood values is necessary for better prediction of engineering constants of strand composites. Among the four species tested, yellow-poplar strands demonstrated the best initial and postprocessing tensile and thickness swelling properties. The willow strands were initially inferior but showed significant improvements in their properties after hot pressing and resin-curing. This indicated that willow, a low-density and low-strength species, could be used as a good supplement material for OSB furnish. © Forest Products Society 2007.

37749005370	Characterization of tangential shrinkage stresses of wood during drying under superheated steam above 100 °C	The characteristics of tangential stresses experienced by Japanese sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) during drying under superheated steam with high temperature and pressure were examined in this study. A load cell capable of operating under high temperature and pressure inside an autoclave was used to measure the shrinkage stresses of water-saturated specimens under various drying conditions. The results showed that significant shrinkage stresses occurred even at 100 percent relative humidity (RH), probably due to decomposition and/or modification of wood components. The relationships between tangential shrinkage stresses and moisture content change at various RHs from high-temperature saturated steam drying were significantly different from those of the radial stresses reported in an early study. The occurrence of these stresses had a strong effect on the overall stress development during wood drying under high RH conditions. The shrinkage stresses were significantly reduced by pretreatment using high-temperature saturated steam to prevent drying defects such as surface checks. The occurrence of shrinkage stresses were also effectively restrained by drying under high-temperature steam. The study showed that temperature and RH level had no direct effect on the maximum tangential shrinkage stresses for drying wood above 20 percent RH and within 160 to 180°C. © Forest Products Society 2007.

38149050648	Thermal decomposition kinetics of natural fibers: Activation energy with dynamic thermogravimetric analysis	Dynamic TG analysis under nitrogen was used to investigate the thermal decomposition processes of 10 types of natural fibers commonly used in the polymer composite industry. These fibers included wood, bamboo, agricultural residue, and bast fibers. Various degradation models including the Kissinger, Friedman, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, and modified Coats-Redfern methods were used to determine the apparent activation energy of these fibers. For most natural fibers approximately 60% of the thermal decomposition occurred within a temperature range between 215 and 310 °C. The result also showed that an apparent activation energy of 160-170 kJ/mol was obtained for most of the selected fibers throughout the polymer processing temperature range. These activation energy values allow developing a simplified approach to understand the thermal decomposition behavior of natural fibers as a function of polymer composite processing. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

59049097703	Transverse mechanical behavior of wood under high temperature and pressurized steam	Transverse mechanical behavior of Japanese sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) under high temperature and pressurized steam environment was investigated. Measured tensile strength was compared with published data of transverse shrinkage, compression yield, and relaxed compression yield stresses. The results showed that at 100 percent relative humidity (RH), tensile strength of the wood along both radial and tangential directions gradually decreased, and the destructive tensile strain increased with increase in temperature. The increase in the destructive strain was more significant when temperatures increased above 100 °C. The relationship between tensile strength and temperature was similar to that of the maximum shrinkage stress and temperature from drying under high RH and different temperatures. Tensile strength and relaxed compression yield stress decreased at a similar rate with increase in temperature. The relationship of radial tensile strength and temperature agreed well with that of compressive yield stress and temperature in a temperature range from 80 to 180 °C at 100 percent RH. The maximum shrinkage stress values from drying were similar to those of relaxed compression yield stresses at the same temperature and RH conditions. The significant reduction of shrinkage stresses during drying under high temperatures and pressurized superheated steam was caused by stress relaxation. © Forest Products Society 2008.

84877785380	Self-assembling behavior of cellulose nanoparticles during freeze-drying: Effect of suspension concentration, particle size, crystal structure, and surface charge	Cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibers with I and II crystalline allomorphs (designated as CNC I, CNC II, CNF I, and CNF II) were isolated from bleached wood fibers by alkaline pretreatment and acid hydrolysis. The effects of concentration, particle size, surface charge, and crystal structure on the lyophilization-induced self-assembly of cellulose particles in aqueous suspensions were studied. Within the concentration range of 0.5 to 1.0 wt %, cellulose particles self-organized into lamellar structured foam composed of aligned membrane layers with widths between 0.5 and 3 μm. At 0.05 wt %, CNC I, CNF I, CNC II, and CNF II self-assembled into oriented ultrafine fibers with mean diameters of 0.57, 1.02, 1.50, and 1.00 μm, respectively. The size of self-assembled fibers became larger when more hydroxyl groups and fewer sulfates (weaker electrostatic repulsion) were on cellulose surfaces. Possible formation mechanism was inferred from ice growth and interaction between cellulose nanoparticles in liquid-crystalline suspensions. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84877341536	Electrospun bio-nanocomposite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering by cellulose nanocrystals reinforcing maleic anhydride grafted PLA	Electrospun fibrous bio-nanocomposite scaffolds reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were fabricated by using maleic anhydride (MAH) grafted poly(lactic acid) (PLA) as matrix with improved interfacial adhesion between the two components. Morphological, thermal, mechanical, and in vitro degradation properties as well as basic cytocompatibility using human adult adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) of MAH grafted PLA/CNC (i.e., MPLA/CNC) scaffolds were characterized. Morphological investigation indicated that the diameter and polydispersity of electrospun MPLA/CNC nanofibers were reduced with the increased CNC content. The addition of CNCs improved both the thermal stability and mechanical properties of MPLA/CNC composites. The MPLA/CNC scaffolds at the 5 wt % CNC loading level showed not only superior tensile strength (more than 10 MPa), but also improved stability during in vitro degradation compared with the MPLA and PLA/CNC counterparts. Moreover, the fibrous MPLA/CNC composite scaffolds were non-toxic to hASCs and capable of supporting cell proliferation. This study demonstrates that fibrous MPLA/CNC bio-nanocomposite scaffolds are biodegradable, cytocompatible, and possess useful mechanical properties for bone tissue engineering. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84897622754	Effects of use of coupling agents on the properties of microfibrillar composite based on high-density polyethylene and polyamide-6	Microfibrillar composites from high-density polyethylene (HDPE-75 wt%) and polyamide-6 (PA6-25 wt%) were made through a reactive extrusion at the processing temperature of PA6 in combination with hot stretching to form microfibrillar composites, and injection molding at the melt temperature of HDPE to form final composites. The scanning electron microscope observations demonstrated the formation of the PA6 microfibers during extrusion. Incorporation of PA6 microfibers led to an improvement in both flexural and tensile properties as compared to the neat HDPE. Use of ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate copolymers (E-GMA) in the composites gave the highest tensile modulus, while ethylene, butyl acrylate and maleic anhydride terpolymer (E-BA-MA) led to the highest tensile strength and elongation. The maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene (MAPE) was the most efficient among three coupling agents in improving impact strength. With the addition of 5 wt% E-GMA, E-BA-MA and MAPE, the HDPE/PA6 composites exhibited an improvement of 87, 116, and 387 %, respectively, compared to the uncoupled controls. The PA6 microfibers exhibited a regular orientation along the stretching direction in the presence of 2.5 wt% coupling agents; increasing the loading level of coupling agents caused a reduction in the diameter of PA6 microfibers. FT-IR analyses showed the reactions between PA6 and the coupling agents used. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

43049155983	Chelating efficiency and thermal, mechanical and decay resistance performances of chitosan copper complex in wood-polymer composites	Wood-polymer composites (WPC) have been extensively used for building products, outdoor decking, automotive, packaging materials, and other applications. WPC is subject to fungal and termite attacks due to wood components enveloped in the thermoplastic matrix. Much effort has been made to improve decay resistance of WPC using zinc borate and other chemicals. In this study, chitosan copper complex (CCC) compounds were used as a potential preservative for wood-HDPE composites. CCC was formulated by reacting chitosan with copper salts under controlled conditions. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analytical results indicated that chitosan had high chelating efficiency with copper cations. CCC-treated wood-HDPE composites had a thermal behavior similar to untreated and zinc borate-treated wood-HDPE composites. Incorporation of CCC in wood-HDPE composites did not significantly influence board density of the resultant composites, but had a negative effect on tensile strength at high CCC concentration. In comparison with solid wood and the untreated wood-HDPE composites, 3% CCC-treated wood-HDPE composites significantly improved the decay resistance against white rot fungus Trametes versicolor and brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum. Especially, CCC-treated wood-HDPE composites were more effectively against the brown rot than the untreated and chitosan-treated wood-HDPE composites. Moreover, CCC-treated wood-HDPE composites performed well as zinc borate-treated wood-HDPE composites on fungal decay resistance. Accordingly, CCC can be effectively used as a preservative for WPC. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

67349165008	Morphology and properties of microfibrillar composites based on recycled poly (ethylene terephthalate) and high density polyethylene	Microfibrillar composites (MFCs) from recycled high density polyethylene (R-HDPE)/recycled poly (ethylene terephthalate) (R-PET) (75/25 w/w) were made through reactive extrusion and post-extrusion strand stretching. The resultant MFCs could be processed at HDPE processing temperature. The compatibility between microfibers and R-HDPE matrix was improved through compatibilizers. Of the three compatibilizers evaluated, ethylene glycidyl methacrylate copolymer (E-GMA) performed the best. The addition of compatibilizers did not obviously change the size of R-PET fibers in MFCs. The toughness of MFC was significantly enhanced, and R-PET phase did not crystallize when 5% E-GMA was used. The process of manufacturing MFCs provides a way to recycle commingled plastics, and MFCs would be potential matrices for natural fiber polymer composites. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

67651007191	Thermal decomposition of natural fibers: Global kinetic modeling with nonisothermal thermogravimetric analysis	The modeling of thermal decomposition process of ten natural fibers commonly used in polymer composite industry was performed by assuming a global model occurring within the entire degradation range with consideration of fiber as one pseudocomponent. Málek method with activation energy values previously obtained was applied to the modeling process. Careful calculation and evaluation indicated that, within an acceptable error limit of 5%, RO(n > 1) model can be used to describe the degradation process of most selected fibers well. The other kinetic parameters used include activation energy range of 160-170 kJ/mol; parameter n in RO(n > 1) = (1 a)nof 3-4; and ln A between 35 and 42 ln s-1. Some condition limitations of the obtained model were also discussed. The model has practical significance in predicting fiber weight loss when the fiber is used in combination with engineering thermoplastics. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

67650094859	Phase structure and properties of poly(ethylene terephthalate)/high-density polyethylene based on recycled materials	Blends based on recycled high density polyethylene (R-HDPE) and recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (R-PET) were made through reactive extrusion. The effects of maleated polyethylene (PE-g-MA), triblock copolymer of styrene and ethylene/butylene (SEBS), and 4,4'-methylenedi(phenyl isocyanate) (MDI) on blend properties were studied. The 2% PE-g-MA improved the compatibility of R-HDPE and R-PET in all blends toughened by SEBS. For the R-HDPE/R-PET (70/30 w/w) blend toughened by SEBS, the dispersed PET domain size was significantly reduced with use of 2% PE-g-MA, and the impact strength of the resultant blend doubled. For blends with R-PET matrix, all strengths were improved by adding MDI through extending the PET molecular chains. The crystalline behaviors of R-HDPE and R-PET in one-phase rich systems influenced each other. The addition of PE-g-MA and SEBS consistently reduced the crystalline level (χ

69249212432	Transitional properties of starch colloid with particle size reduction from micro- to nanometer	High-pressure homogenization was used to disperse starch particles in water and reduce the size from micro- to nanometer. The resultant starch colloids were characterized by particle morphology, mean size, size distribution, and zeta potential. Starch slurries were transformed from a mixture containing sediment, dispersion, and sol, to gel as a result of reduction of the particle size from 3-6 μm to 10-20 nm under a pressure of 207 MPa. Furthermore, this process led to the transition of fluid properties without affecting the crystal structure and thermal stability of starch granules. Viscosity of the colloids increased with an increased number of homogenization passes, accompanied by a decreased particle size, narrower particle size distribution (PSD), and an increased absolute zeta potential, indicating the formation of a suspension or stable gel composed of nanoparticles. Lognormal and two other mathematical functions were established to describe the PSDs and their relationship to the homogenization passes. Hence, an environmentally friendly means of producing starch-based nanoparticles or nanogels with high yields, and predictable size and viscosity properties was presented.

77958459035	Application of rod-shaped cellulose nanocrystals in polyacrylamide hydrogels	Rod-shaped cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were manufactured and used to reinforce polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogels through in situ free-radical polymerization. The gelation process of the nanocomposite hydrogels was monitored on a rheometer using oscillatory shear. The chemical structure, morphology, swelling property, and compression strength of the formed gels were investigated. A possible mechanism for forming hydrogels was proposed. The results showed that CNCs accelerated the formation of hydrogels and increased the effective crosslink density of hydrogels. Thus CNCs were not only a reinforcing agent for hydrogel, but also acted as a multifunctional cross-linker for gelation. The shear storage modulus, compression strength and elastic modulus of the nanocomposite hydrogels were significantly improved because of good dispersion of CNCs in PAM as well as enhanced interfacial interaction between these two components. Among the CNC contents used, a loading of 6.7. w/w% led to the maximum mechanical properties for nanocomposite hydrogels. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

78649919258	Wood-polymer composites prepared by the in situ polymerization of monomers within wood	Wood-polymer composites (WPCs) were prepared from poplar wood (P. ussuriensis Komarov) in a two-step procedure. Maleic anhydride (MAN) was first dissolved in acetone and impregnated into wood; this was followed by a heat process; and then, glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and styrene (St) were further impregnated into the MAN-treated wood, followed by a second thermal treatment. Finally, the novel WPC was fabricated. The reactions occurring in the WPC, the aggregation of the resulting polymers, and their interaction with the wood substrate were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and dynamic mechanical analysis. The performance of WPC was also evaluated in terms of the mechanical properties and durability, which were then correlated with the structural analysis of the WPC. The test results show that MAN and GMA/St chemically reacted with the wood cell walls in sequence, and the quantity of hydroxyl groups in the wood cell walls was evidently reduced. Meanwhile, St copolymerized with GMA or MAN, and the resulting polymers mainly filled in the wood cell lumen in an amorphous form, tightly contacting the wood cell walls without noticeable gaps. As a result, the mechanical properties, decay resistance, and dimensional stability of the WPC were remarkably improved over those of the untreated wood, and its glass-transition temperature also increased. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

78650710130	Chitosan colloidal suspension composed of mechanically disassembled nanofibers	Joint treatments of wet-grinding and high-pressure homogenization effectively disassembled chitosan particles into nanofibers by breaking the bond interactions between the chitosan crystalline fibrils using only strong mechanical force. We demonstrated the size reduction of chitosan fibers and characterized the properties and structure of the obtained nanofibrils. Results showed that the obtained nanofibers had a diameter of about 50. nm, which comprised small bundles of nanofibrils with a diameter of 1-5. nm. The zeta potential, viscosity, and stability of the nanofibrous suspension were studied and found to be dependent on the pH value of the aqueous media. Optical properties of the suspension were also characterized. After an isotropic-nematic phase transition, the chitosan nanofibrous colloids exhibited a nematic liquid crystal structure due to the layer-by-layer stacking of self-aligned nanofibers. The freeze-dried liquid crystalline colloids were shaped like a sponge with a wide-range of pore sizes and large surface areas, which could serve as an ideal tissue scaffold. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

78951487863	Structure and rheology of nanocrystalline cellulose	Sulfate hydrolysis and high-pressure homogenization were combined to reduce the size of microcrystalline cellulose to the nanoscale. The obtained needle-shaped nanocrystals showed a relative uniform size with length of 90 ± 50 nm and width of 10 ± 4 nm. Rheology and phase transition of the nanocrystal colloids were studied. The flowability and modulus of the colloids showed a strong relationship with frequency, temperature, and concentration of the nanocrystals. Nanocrystals self-assembled into a liquid crystal phase in colloids and even in the dried film. Structure and morphology of the ordered liquid crystalline phase were characterized by scanning electron microscope and polarized optical microscope. It was found that cellulose nanocrystals were self-aligned layer by layer, which was responsible for the color of the dried film and also allowed an ordered layered microporous foam from the freeze-dried nanocrystalline colloids. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79952562135	Durability improvement of bio-based material by polymer	Bio-based materials such as wood, bamboo, bio-straw material are vulnerable to degradation by microorganisms and susceptible to change in dimension under humidity, which greatly reduced their service life. In this study, a novel thought was inspired from the unique porous structure of bio-based material that durability of wood may be capable of being improved by generating polymer in situ the special structure. Maleic anhydride (Man) and Styrene (St) were used to penetrate into wood for further copolymerization. SEM observation shows that polymer filled in wood porous structure and tightly contacted wood matrix (i.e. biopolymers), indicating strong interaction between them. FTIR analysis indicates that polymer chemically grafted onto wood matrix by reaction of anhydride group and hydroxyl group. As the amount of hydroxyl groups greatly reduced for their reacting with polymer, the dimensional stability of wood immersing in water was improved; and as the reaction of wood with polymer, the biopolymers were wrapped by resultant polymer, preventing the sample from attack of microorganisms, thus decay resistance of treated wood against microorganisms was greatly improved. Both of them contributed to the improvement of wood durability. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

81255135926	UV-initiated crosslinking of electrospun poly(ethylene oxide) nanofibers with pentaerythritol triacrylate: Effect of irradiation time and incorporated cellulose nanocrystals	UV-initiated crosslinking of electrospun poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) nanofibers in the presence of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) was performed with pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA) as both photo-initiator and crosslinker in order to determine the effect of irradiation time and incorporated CNCs. The chemical structure and morphologies, swelling and mechanical properties of crosslinked nanofibers were investigated. The experimental results show that UV irradiation did not exhibit a dramatic effect on the diameter of PEO nanofibers. Among the irradiation time used, a 40 min time was optimal for the UV-initiated crosslinking process. With increased CNC content up to 10 wt%, the crosslinked PEO/CNC composite nanofibers became more uniform and smaller in diameter, and also showed a significant improvement in the swelling and mechanical properties. At the CNC content of 10 wt%, the maximum tensile stress and Young's modulus of the crosslinked PEO/CNC composite fibrous mats increased by 377.5 and 190.5% than those of uncrosslinked PEO mats, and 76.5 and 127.4% than those of crosslinked PEO mats, respectively. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

83955161126	Performance of bamboo plastic composites with hybrid bamboo and precipitated calcium carbonate fillers	The influences of hybrid bamboo and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) fillers in a recycled polypropylene/polyethylene matrix on the properties of bamboo plastic composites were studied. Thermogravimetric and Fourier transform infrared analyses of both thermo-mechanically refined bamboo fiber (RBF) and ground bamboo particle (GBP) showed relatively higher holocellulose content in RBF, and more effective silane grafting on the RBF surface. The raw PCC particles contained over 95% calcium carbonate, and had an agglomerated form consisting of particles with a mean diameter of about 1.2 microns. Compounding the PCC particles with the plastic resin helped separate and disperse them in the matrix. Measured flexural strength and modulus of PCC-only-filled composites increased significantly from 15 to 30% PCC content levels, while the tensile and impact strength of composites decreased with the addition of PCC. For composites with hybrid bamboo and PCC fillers, tensile and flexural moduli were improved with the increase of PCC content. After silane treatment, RBF-filled composites showed noticeably increased mechanical properties compared with those of GBP-filled composites. For modulus values, PCC-bamboo-polymer composites were 3-4 times higher than those of PCC-polymer composites at high PCC levels. © 2011 Society of Plastics Engineers.

Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and wide-angle X-ray diffraction data showed that the fibers had been transformed from cellulose I (native) to cellulose II (mercerized) crystal structure, and these polymorphs were retained in the nanocrystals, giving CNC-I and CNC-II. Transmission electron microscopy showed rod-like crystal morphology for both types of crystals under the given processing conditions with CNC-II having similar width but reduced length. Freeze-dried agglomerates of CNC-II had a much higher bulk density than that of CNC-I. Thermo-gravimetric analysis showed that CNC-II had better thermal stability. The storage moduli of CNC-II suspensions at all temperatures were substantially larger than those of CNC-I suspensions at the same concentration level. CNC-II suspensions and gels were more stable in response to temperature increases. Films of CNC and Poly(ethylene oxide) were tested. Both CNC-I/PEO and CNC-II/PEO composites showed increased tensile strength and elongation at break compared to pure PEO. However, composites with CNC-II had higher strength and elongation than composites with CNC-I. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84862946985	Improvement of dimensional stability of wood via combination treatment: Swelling with maleic anhydride and grafting with glycidyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate	A novel two-step combined treatment of poplar wood was developed to improve its dimensional stability. Maleic anhydride (MAN) was first employed to swell and bond to the wood cell wall, and then mixed monomers of glycidyl methacrylate/ methyl methacrylate (GMA/MMA) were grafted to the cell wall through the chemical reaction with MAN within the wood cell lumen. The results of scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray apparatus (SEMEDX) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses indicate that MAN penetrated and chemically bonded to the cell wall causing 9% volume swelling, and the copolymer from GMA/MMA monomers was grafted onto the wood cell wall, resulting in the improved interfacial compatibility between the polymer and wood matrix. The dimensional stability of poplar wood modified by the combined two-step treatment was remarkably improved compared with that of untreated poplar wood. The combination treatment of wood employed in this study proved to be more effective for improving the dimensional stability than treatment with PEG-1000 aqueous solution with 30% concentration.

84864115546	Mechanical properties and in vitro degradation of electrospun bio-nanocomposite mats from PLA and cellulose nanocrystals	Fibrous bio-nanocomposite mats consisting of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) were electrospun from a solvent mixture consisting of N,N′-dimethylformamide and chloroform at room temperature. Morphological, mechanical and thermal properties, as well as in vitro degradation of nanocomposite mats were characterized as a function of material composition. Average diameter of the electrospun fibers decreased with increased CNC-loading level. Thermal stability, and tensile strength and modulus of nanocomposite mats were effectively improved by the addition of CNCs up to the 5 wt% level. The reinforcement of CNCs on electrospun mats was illustrated by the observation of SEM-based morphologies on the tensile fracturing process of nanocomposite mats. At the CNC content of 5 wt%, the maximum tensile stress and Young's modulus of the nanocomposite mats increased by 5 and 22 folds than those of neat PLA mats, respectively.

84865415843	Effect of high-pressure homogenization on particle size and film properties of soy protein isolate	High-pressure homogenization (HPH) was used to treat soy protein isolate (SPI) suspensions (7.0%, w/w) in order to reduce SPI's particle size. The obtained suspensions were characterized by studying particle morphology, mean particle size, particle size distribution, zeta potential, rheological properties, and composite film formation. The results showed homogenization pressure and number of homogenization passes had an obvious influence on the mean particle size and the size distribution. The SPI suspension homogenized at 207. MPa from 0 to 30 passes exhibited a shear-thinning behavior, which was accompanied by the reduction of mean particle size from 3331.3 to 135.8. nm, narrower particle size distributions, and increased absolute zeta potentials. Small particle sizes not only improved mechanical and transparent properties, but also reduced water absorption properties for SPI films. However, the reduction of particle size showed little impact on the thermal properties of SPI films. These findings may help better utilization of SPI in the development of novel SPI-based films. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84865791638	Copper/carbon core shell nanoparticles as additive for natural fiber/wood plastic blends	Copper/carbon core/shell nanoparticles (CCCSNs) recently have been introduced as an industrial material. In this paper, composites based on high density polyethylene (HDPE), bamboo fiber, CCCSNs, and coupling agent (MAPE) were prepared by melt compounding. The influence of CCCSN content on the resulting composites' mechanical, biological resistance, and thermal properties was investigated. It was found that CCCSNs within the carbon black matrix were processed well with bamboo fiber-plastic blends through mixing and injection molding. The materials enhanced composite strength and modulus-related properties. Composites with CCCSNs and natural fibers reduced heat capacity and thermal diffusivity. Composites with CCCSN materials also enhanced termite and mold performance. Thus, the material can be used as additive for plastics and other polymers to modify strength properties, biological resistance (e.g., mold and stain), and thermal conductivity properties.

84869492169	Mechanical and physical properties of core-shell structured wood plastic composites: Effect of shells with hybrid mineral and wood fillers	The effects of shells filled with silane treated precipitated calcium carbonate (TPCC) and wood fiber (WF) on properties of core-shell structured wood plastic composites (WPCs) were studied with two different core systems. In a weak core system made with recycled polypropylene (PP)/high density polyethylene (HDPE), coextruded WPCs with reinforced virgin HDPE shells showed significantly improved flexural strengths compared with their core-only controls. In a strong core system made of virgin HDPE, the composite flexural strengths were lowered in relation to their core-only controls. Impact strengths for both systems were noticeably improved with added shells. Specially, the impact strengths of the weak core coextruded WPCs showed up to 150% increases in relation to their core-only controls. Impact fracture types varied largely with core quality and filler composition in the shell. Water absorption of coextruded WPCs with high TPCC contents in the shell was lower than that of core-only controls and coextruded WPCs with high wood contents in the shell layer. The use of high percentage of plastic in the shell layer led to the increases of overall composite's coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). However, increased filler loadings in the shell helped reduce the CTE values, especially, for the weak core system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84872773890	Thermal expansion behavior of co-extruded wood-plastic composites with glass-fiber reinforced shells	Coextruded wood-plastic composites (WPCs) with glass-fiber (GF) filled shells were manufactured, and their thermal expansion behavior was studied. A three-dimensional finite element model (FEM) considering differential properties of both shell and core layers was developed to predict the linear coefficient of thermal expansion (LCTE) of the material. It was shown that the LCTE values varied with composite structure and composition (i.e., core-shell thicknesses and materials). The use of GF-filled shells helped lower overall composite LCTE values. The imbalance of shell and core LCTE, and their moduli led to complex stress fields within a given composite system. The FEM predicted a trend of LCTE change with varying composite structures, which was in good agreement with the experimental data. This study provides for the first time a finite element modeling technique to optimize raw material composition and composite structure for optimizing thermal expansion behavior of co-extruded WPCs.

84872817753	Effect of hybrid mineral and bamboo fillers on thermal expansion behavior of bamboo fiber and recycled polypropylene-polyethylene composites	The effect of bamboo and hybrid bamboo-precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) fillers on thermal expansion behavior of filled plastic composites was investigated. The linear coefficient of thermal expansion (LCTE) of the filled composites decreased with increased PCC and bamboo filler loading levels. The composite system with refined bamboo fibers (RBFs) had smaller LCTE values compared with those from the systems with ground bamboo particles (GBPs). The use of silane treatment on bamboo fiber/particle surface helped enhance its bonding to the plastic matrix, leading to a further reduction of LCTE values for both GBP and RBF composite systems. The observed behavior of reduced LCTE is attributed to a small filler LCTE value, reduced overall plastic volume, and enhanced interfacial bonding with treated bamboo materials. Thus, hybrid bamboo and PCC fillers are suitable materials for reducing the thermal expansion of the composites caused by temperature changes.

Fractal dimension of void size (FDVS) in the manufactured samples was studied by means of X-ray computer tomography images and a computer image processing technique. The FDVS value was high in the panel surface layers and decreased toward the panel center, and the FDVS decrement was linear to increased porosity. At the same overall porosity level, the FDVS varied as function of void distribution. FDVS could be a useful additional parameter for characterizing the internal void structure of strand-based wood composites.

84874942036	Characterization of cellulose II nanoparticles regenerated from 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride	Regenerated cellulose nanoparticles (RCNs) including both elongated fiber and spherical structures were prepared from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and cotton using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride followed by high-pressure homogenization. The crystalline structure of RCNs was cellulose II in contrast to the cellulose I form of the starting materials. Also, the RCNs have decreased crystallinity and crystallite size. The elongated RCNs produced from cotton and MCC had average lengths of 123 ± 34 and 112 ± 42 nm, and mean widths of 12 ± 5 and 12 ± 3 nm, respectively. The average diameter of spherical RCNs from MCC was 118 ± 32 nm. The dimensions of the various RCNs were all well fitted with an asymmetrical log-normal distribution function. The RCN has a two-step pyrolysis, different from raw MCC and cotton that have a one-step process. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84876125111	Borate -treated strand board from southern wood species: Resistance against decay and mold fungi	Combined decay and mold resistance of zinc borate-(ZB) and calcium borate-(CB) treated oriented strand board (OSB) from southern mixed hardwood (MHW) and southern yellow pine (SYP) was investigated. Tests were done with a brown-rot fungus, Gloeophyllum trabeum, and a white-rot fungus, Trametes versicolor, for 8 and 12 weeks, respectively. Wood species and fungus type had significant influence on the decay resistance. Decay caused by the brown-rot fungus was evident for all untreated SYP and mixed MHW controls. White-rot fungus did not cause significant sample weight loss for either species group. In the SYP OSB control inoculated with G. trabeum, the hyphae were abundant in wood rays and cell walls where they primarily penetrated through bordered and simple pits. The incorporation of ZB and CB into OSB provided significant protection against the fungi with no significant weight loss observed in the treated OSB. Microscopic analysis showed distinct evidence of fungal colonization and a thinning pattern of cell wall material. Untreated OSB samples from MHW and commercial OSBs were most susceptible to mold growth after 6 weeks. The borate-modified OSB from MHW and SYP effectively prevented the mold growth.

84877963748	Co-extruded wood-plastic composites with talc-filled shells: Morphology, mechanical, and thermal expansion performance	The effect of unmodified talc particles on the mechanical and thermal expansion performance of talc-filled high density polyethylene (HDPE) and co-extruded wood plastic composite (WPC) with talc-filled shells was studied. The use of talc in HDPE helped enhance its tensile, bending, and dynamic modulus, but lowered its tensile and impact strength. The selected models for composite modulus and tensile strength fit the data well after adjusting the model parameters. Talc-filled HDPE had lower linear coefficient of thermal expansion (LCTE) values in comparison with the neat HDPE values, and the LCTE reduction rate increased after the talc loading levels increased above the 30 wt%. Extruding a relatively thick, less-stiff HDPE shell with a large LCTE value over a stiff and thermally stable WPC core decreased overall composite modulus and increased the LCTE values. The composite modulus and strength increased and LCTE values decreased with increase of the talc loading levels in the shell. The impact strength of co-extruded WPC was greatly enhanced with unfilled- and filled HDPE shells.

84879398940	Mechanical and thermal performance of coextruded wood plastic composites for structural applications	Wood Plastic Composites (WPCs) are a new generation of green composites that contain thermoplastics and wood/natural fibres in various forms, which can come mostly from recycled materials. Using co-extrusion techniques, WPCs show good moisture resistance, economical cost, and recycling performance. However, as structural engineering components, they have a relatively low modulus of elasticity and low strength because of their macromolecular nature. A detailed investigation on WPC mechanical performance is therefore highly desirable before their wide structural applications. In this study, an advanced manufacturing system for producing coextruded WPCs with a core-shell structure and continuous fibre reinforcement was firstly introduced. Based on the products manufactured using this system, a series of laboratory experiments were carried out. Then for better understanding the mechanical performance, especially stiffness and strength, a series of parametric studies were conducted by varying the geometric parameters for both basic coextruded WPCs and advanced coextruded WPCs with continuous fibre reinforcement. A numerical pullout test for the continuous fibre was also included. A comprehensive thermal study of thermal expansion, temperature distribution, and thermal-induced stress distribution were also carried out to demonstrate the fundamental thermal characteristics of the coextruded WPCs. Based on the analysis, section design optimization taking both mechanical and thermal viewpoints into account is finally given. It can be concluded that the coextruded WPCs can achieve good mechanical and thermal performances through an optimized design and are well suited to practical structural engineering application.

The pretreatment is a key link in hydrogen production process. Especially, mechanical crushing combined with enzymolysis pretreatment process which is an efficiently way. Therefore, it is necessary to study on the pretreatment and properties of ultrastructural straw. The reducing sugar yield which came from the straw after ball milling crushing was used as reference to carry on the single factor and orthogonal experiments to examine the effect of ball milling. Particle size analyzer, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction was utilized to observe the properties of ultrastructural straw. Corncob was measured to have the highest reducing sugar yield. Through analyzing results with DPS analysis software, the optimal parameters of ball milling pretreatment were obtained, as followed: initial size of raw material 0.45mm, ball/powder weight ratio 20:1, milling time 2h. After ball milling, biomass cell wall was effectively opened, specific surface increased, particle size decreased, the microstructure changed and became loose and porous, the cellulose degree of crystallinity were all aggressively lowered, cellulose accessibility was increased, the saccharified rate was improved with the decreasing particle size. All these properties will make the hydrogen producing capacity increased efficiency. These parameters and properties are of great value to reduce the cost of hydrogen production and to promote the development of biological hydrogen production technology by photosynthetic bacteria.

84882766575	Experimental and numerical analysis of the sound insulation property of wood plastic composites (WPCs) filled with precipitated CaCO3	The sound transmission loss (STL) of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC)-filled wood plastic composite (WPC) was studied using a numerical analysis method based on the mass law and sound scattering theory. Several physical models for explaining sound wave transmission in WPC were established, and relevant STL equations were derived. The STL of WPC filled with different PCC weight ratios was analyzed using these models. The results showed that the STL of WPC increased with an increase in sound frequency and PCC weight ratio. The improvement of sound insulation was attributed to the mass increase, sound scattering enhancement by the fillers, and PCC weight ratio. The predicted results showed similar trends to the experimental data under the same processing conditions. It was concluded that the proposed models can be used to analyze the STL of filled WPC. Larger inorganic particle size led to higher STL, but its effect was not obvious at lower frequency ranges. Predicted STL increased with increased weight ratio of wood for the whole frequency range tested.

84885412206	A novel biodegradable β-cyclodextrin-based hydrogel for the removal of heavy metal ions	A novel biodegradable β-cyclodextrin-based gel (CAM) was prepared and applied to the removal of Cd2+, Pb2+ and Cu2+ ions from aqueous solutions. CAM hydrogel has a typical three-dimensional network structure, and showed excellent capability for the removal of heavy metal ions. The effect of different experimental parameters, such as initial pH, adsorbent dosage and initial metal ion concentration, were investigated. The adsorption isotherm data fitted well to the Freundlich model. The adsorption capacity was in the order Pb2+ > Cu2+ > Cd2+ under the same experimental conditions. The maximum adsorption capacities for the metal ions in terms of mg/g of dry gel were 210.6 for Pb2+, 116.41 for Cu2+, and 98.88 for Cd2+. The biodegradation efficiency of the resin reached 79.4% for Gloeophyllum trabeum. The high adsorption capacity and kinetics results indicate that CAM can be used as an alternative adsorbent to remove heavy metals from aqueous solution.

The effects of several parameters such as pH, contact time, and particle doses were tested, and the acid dyes removal behaviors of both types of particles were compared. The removal of azo acid dyes on CTD and CTB was pH-dependent, and the maximum removal of ≥90.7% was reached for Acid Black 10 B and 52.6% for Acid Red 14 in aqueous solution at pH 5.0. The effect of particle dosages on the removal of Acid Black 10 B and Acid Red 14 was important for two modified CLT particles. An excessive amount of modified CLT particles increased the chromaticity of water samples and caused the decline of dyes removal. Zeta (ζ) potential data revealed that the main mechanism of removal of the acid dyes on the CTD and CTB particles was charge neutralization.

84887198517	Influences of layered structure on physical and mechanical properties of kenaf core particleboard	Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus), a fast-growing fiber crop, is a potential substitute for wood to make composition boards. This work investigated single- and three-layer kenaf core particleboards (KPBs) and kenaf core-cedar wood composite particleboard (KCPB) with polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (pMDI) and phenol formaldehyde (PF) resins. The physical and mechanical properties including bending modulus (MOE) and strength (MOR), internal bond (IB) strength, water absorption (WA), thickness swelling (TS), and linear expansion (LE) were tested following the ASTM D 1037 and ANSI A 208.1 standards. It was shown that kenaf core can be made into standard-satisfying particleboards with comparable performances to cedar-based wood panels. Three processing factors, i.e., board density, resin content, and layered construction, had significant influences on panel properties. KPBs denser than 0.70 g/cm3 and with 6% PF met with the standard specifications. The WA, TS, and LE of single-layer KPBs decreased with increased density. Three-layer KPBs showed improved MOE, MOR, and IB strengths, and effectively avoided the unbalanced structure shown in the single-layer KPBs in thickness direction. The three-layer KPBs with a 50:50 surface-to-core ratio had the best comprehensive performances. The results can be helpful for the application of kenaf residues in the wood composites industry.

The effects of particle size, aspect ratio, crystal structure, and surface charge of CNPs on the rheological properties of the composite hydrogels were investigated. The rheological measurements confirmed the incorporation of well-dispersed CNPs to PB system significantly enhanced the viscoelasticity and stiffness of hydrogels. The obtained free-standing, high elasticity and mouldable hydrogels exhibited self-recovery under continuous step strain and thermo-reversibility under temperature sweep. With the addition of cellulose I nanofibers, a 19-fold increase in the high-frequency plateau of storage modulus was obtained compared with that of the pure PB. CNPs acted as multifunctional crosslinking agents and nanofillers to physically and chemically bridge the 3D network hydrogel. The plausible mechanism for the multi-complexation between CNPs, polyvinyl alcohol and borax was proposed to understand the relationship between the 3D network and hydrogel properties. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed common fire retardation actions of the three compounds by releasing incombustible gas and/or water vapor to dilute combustible gas in the flaming zone, and by converting to MgO, which had a satisfactory protective wall effect on the wood. Individually, BMC absorbed heat from the wood at the pre-decomposition stage and, thus, slowed down wood pyrolysis process. It slightly increased the char yield by charring in both the charring stage and the char calcination stage. MH lost water at about 270 °C, close to the temperature at which wood thermally degraded. MH rendered wood char quickly, and the compact char layer impeded further carbonization and burning of inner wood. MCH promoted charring with Mg

84899687711	Mechanical, thermal expansion, and flammability properties of co-extruded wood polymer composites with basalt fiber reinforced shells	Basalt fiber (BF) filled high density polyethylene (HDPE) and co-extruded wood plastic composites (WPCs) with BF/HDPE composite shell were successfully prepared and their mechanical, morphological and thermal properties characterized. The BFs had an average diameter of 7. μm with an organic surfactant surface coating, which was thermally decomposed at about 210. °C. Incorporating BFs into HDPE matrix substantially enhanced flexural, tensile and dynamic modulus without causing a noticeable decrease in the tensile and impact strength of the composites. Micromechanical modeling of tensile properties for the BF/HDPE composites showed a good fit of the selected models to the experimental data. Compared to neat HDPE, BF/HDPE composites had reduced linear coefficient of thermal expansion (LCTE) values. The use of the pure HDPE and BF/HDPE layers over a WPC core greatly improved impact strength of core-shell structured composites. However, the relatively less-stiff HDPE shell with large LCTE values decreased the overall composite modulus and thermal stability. Both flexural and thermal expansion properties were enhanced with BF reinforced HDPE shells, leading to well-balanced properties of core-shell structured material. Cone calorimetry analysis indicated that flammability performance of core-shell structured composites was improved as the BF content increased in the shell layer. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of three preparation variables (i.e., HPAM anionicity, content of CNCs, and pH value of prepared solution) on swelling properties and equilibrium adsorption were studied systematically. The results showed that improved swelling properties and enhanced MB adsorption capacity were acquired by raising HPAM anionicity, by increasing CNC's content up to 20. wt.%, and by decreasing pH value of solution. The optimum HPAM/CNC nanocomposite hydrogels had an adsorption efficiency of more than 90%. MB adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order and Elovich models. The adsorption isotherms of nanocomposite hydrogels could be described very well by the Langmuir equation. A possible adsorption mechanism was inferred based on the results of adsorption kinetics and isotherms to show the synergistic effect of HPAM and CNCs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84911416059	The effect of chemical and high-pressure homogenization treatment conditions on the morphology of cellulose nanoparticles	Cellulose nanoparticles were fabricated from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) through combined acid hydrolysis with sulfuric and hydrochloric acids and high-pressure homogenization. The effect of acid type, acid-to-MCC ratio, reaction time, and numbers of high-pressure homogenization passes on morphology and thermal stability of the nanoparticles was studied. An aggressive acid hydrolysis was shown to lead to rod-like cellulose nanocrystals with diameter about 10 nm and lengths in the range of 50-200 nm. Increased acid-to-MCC ratio and number of homogenization treatments reduced the dimension of the nanocrystals produced. Weak acid hydrolysis treatment led to a network of cellulose nanofiber bundles having diameters in the range of 20-100 nm and lengths of a few thousands of nanometers. The high-pressure homogenization treatment helped separate the nanofiber bundles. The thermal degradation behaviors characterized by thermogravimetric analysis at nitrogen atmosphere indicated that the degradation of cellulose nanocrystals from sulfuric acid hydrolysis started at a lower temperature and had two remarkable pyrolysis processes. The thermal stability of cellulose nanofibers produced from hydrochloric acid hydrolysis improved significantly.

Water diffusion characteristics in the composites were analyzed using a one-dimensional diffusion model. The mechanism of water sorption for all composites deviated from Fick's law of diffusion. Much larger diffusion coefficient values are observed from the desorption process when compared to the absorption process. Measured final equilibrium moisture content and calculated diffusion coefficients varied with sample formulation in a non-consistent manner; this indicated that the durability treatment used in the current study did not negatively affect the water sorption behavior of WPCs. The results of this study help to clarify the effect of durability treatment on the dynamic moisture sorption process of WPCs.

Scanning electron microscopy observation showed that the comrind stem consists of an outer waxy layer, rind fibers, and an inner pith. Rind fiber cell walls are thicker than those of southern pine, which is especially true for the outer surface region. Compared to southern pine, rind has a less uniform cell structure. There are distinct regions where fibers with thick cell walls are surrounded with thin cell wall fibers. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis revealed that the rind fibers and inner pith had the same DSC patterns. The outer waxy layer of rind showed inferior thermal stability. Rind nodes showed slightly less thermal stability than the stalk. Rind and wood had different DSC patterns in the temperature range from 150° to 200°C. Thermogravimetric analysis results showed that comrind was less thermally stable than southern pine wood. At a given level of relative humidity, comrind reached a slightly higher equilibrium moisture content (EMC) compared to wood strands for both adsorption and desorption. A sorption hysteresis was observed for all materials tested. Nelson's sorption isotherm accurately reproduced the experimental data of these different materials. Comrind had the largest tensile strength among the various materials tested. Similar to wood, tensile strength of rind decreased with an increase of its moisture content except at a low EMC of 3.7 percent.
