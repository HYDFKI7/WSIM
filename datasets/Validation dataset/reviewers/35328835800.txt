The loading structure is composed of two symmetrically positioned twin lines. The loading structure acts as a bandstop filter in the corresponding frequency band, and meanwhile functions as a reflector in the operating frequency band, which is not a combination but an integration of reflector and bandstop filter. Measured results show that the realized gain of the loaded planar dipole antenna is 5.1 dBi for the allocated operating frequency and -23 dBi for the stopband frequency.

Specifically, the approximate statistics functions of the squared inner product between the optimal and quantized vectors are derived. With these statistics, we analyze the outage performance. Furthermore, the effects of channel estimation error and number of primary users on the system performance are investigated.

84871645391	On the performance of dual-hop systems with multiple antennas: Effects of spatial correlation, keyhole, and co-channel interference	In this paper, taking into account realistic propagation conditions, namely, spatial correlation, keyhole channels, and unequal-power co-channel interference, we investigate the performance of a wireless relay network where all the nodes are equipped with multiple antennas. Considering channel state information assisted amplify-and-forward protocol, we present analytical expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) and outage probability. More specifically, we first derive the SER expressions of a relay system with orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) over correlated/keyhole fading channels. We also analyze the outage probability of interference corrupted relay systems with maximal ratio combing (MRC) at the receiver as well as multiple-input multiple-output MRC (MIMO MRC). Numerical results are given to illustrate and verify the analytical results. © 2012 IEEE.

84878937239	Performance analysis of distributed beamforming in a spectrum sharing system	In this paper, we consider a distributed beamforming scheme (DBF) in a spectrum sharing system where multiple secondary users share the spectrum with the licensed primary users under an interference temperature constraint. We assume that DBF is applied at the secondary users. We first consider optimal beamforming and compare it with the user selection scheme in terms of the outage probability and bit-error rate performance. Since perfect feedback is difficult to obtain, we then investigate a limited feedback DBF scheme and develop an outage probability analysis for a random vector quantization (RVQ) design algorithm. Numerical results are provided to illustrate our mathematical formalism and verify our analysis. © 2012 IEEE.

84893630298	Energy-efficient dynamic cooperative virtual MIMO based routing protocol in wireless sensor networks	Cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) based communication architecture is used for energy efficient communication in wireless sensor networks. Without increasing transmission energy consumption of nodes, MIMO technology can make use of the cumulative energy of the sender node to increase the sending signal to noise ratio, thus reducing the error rate and improve the reliability of data communication. In the same transmit power and bit error rate situations, using MIMO technology can provide higher data rates, reduce the node sending time, thereby reduce the energy consumption. In this paper, dynamic cooperative virtual MIMO (DCVM) method based on residual energy information is proposed. In the specific application environment, simulation results show that the DCVM based routing protocol is more energy-efficient than single input single output (SISO) in case of long-distance communication and it prolongs sensor network lifetime as well. © 2013 IEEE.

84893917689	A distributed fiber vibration sensor utilizing dispersion induced walk-off effect in a unidirectional Mach-Zehnder interferometer	We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel ultra-long range and sensitive distributed fiber vibration sensor. Only one unidirectional Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is employed in this scheme as the sensing element. In this sensor structure, we utilize chromatic dispersion-induced walk-off effect between the vibration signals sensed by two distributed feedback (DFB) lasers at different wavelengths to locate the vibration position. Vibration signals with frequencies up to 9MHz can be detected and the spatial resolution of 31m is achieved over 320km of the standard single mode fiber. Monitoring multiple vibration sources can also be realized using this scheme. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84897477862	Performance analysis of free-space optical communication systems with multiuser diversity over atmospheric turbulence channels	Free-space optical (FSO) communication has become a cost-effective method to provide high data rates. However, the turbulence-induced fading limits its application to short-range applications. To address this, we propose a multiuser diversity (MD) FSO scheme in which the Nth best user is selected and the channel fluctuations can be effectively exploited to produce a selection diversity gain. More specifically, we first present the statistics analysis for the considered system over both weak and strong atmospheric turbulence channels. Based on these statistics, the outage probability, bit-error rate performance, average capacity, diversity order, and coverage are analyzed. Results show that the diversity order for the gamma-gamma fading is N min {α, β}/2, where N is the number of users, and α and β are the channel fading parameters related to the effective atmospheric conditions of the link. © 2009-2012 IEEE.

In particular, we consider two different combining schemes at the receiver: optimal combining (OC) and selection combining (SC). With these setups, the statistic characters of the instantaneous electrical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are derived. Then, using the cumulative density function (CDF)-based method, we analyze the asymptotic bit-error rate (BER) performance.

84910065790	Performance analysis of relay-assisted all-optical FSO networks over strong atmospheric turbulence channels with pointing errors	In this study, we consider a relay-assisted free-space optical communication scheme over strong atmospheric turbulence channels with misalignment-induced pointing errors. The links from the source to the destination are assumed to be all-optical links. Assuming a variable gain relay with amplify-and-forward protocol, the electrical signal at the source is forwarded to the destination with the help of this relay through all-optical links. More specifically, we first present a cumulative density function (CDF) analysis for the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio. Based on this CDF, the outage probability, bit-error rate, and average capacity of our proposed system are derived. Results show that the system diversity order is related to the minimum value of the channel parameters.

84914150142	Three-dimension numerical simulation of a supersonic flow with transverse hydrogen jet	Three-dimension numerical simulation of a supersonic flow with transverse hydrogen jetis performed using ASUMDV scheme and k-co SST two-equation turbulence model with Wilcox compressibility correction. The numerical results are compared to the experimental data and the good agreements indicate that the adopted numerical method is reliable. The flow and mixing characteristics of the flowfield are analyzed in detail. It is found that; the complicated vortex system and mixing process are well captured by the numerical scheme and turbulence model; the mixing process between air and hydrogen is mainly controlled by a counter-rotating streamwise vortex pair generated by interaction between mainstream and jet, which indicates that increasing the strength of the streamwise vortex is an effective method to enhance the mixing rate between air and hydrogen; in the jet wake region, the heat release is relatively higher near the wall, so the penetration height of jet should large enough in practical application to avoid too high heat flux on the wall.

84914152413	Capacity analysis of spectrum sharing spatial multiplexing MIMO systems	This paper considers a spectrum sharing (SS) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system operating in a Rayleigh fading environment. First the capacity of a single-user SS spatial multiplexing system is investigated in two scenarios that assume different receivers. To explicitly show the capacity scaling law of SS MIMO systems, some approximate capacity expressions for the two scenarios are derived. Next, we extend our analysis to a multiple user system with zero-forcing receivers (ZF) under spatially-independent scheduling and analyze the sum-rate. Furthermore, we provide an asymptotic sum-rate analysis to investigate the effects of different parameters on the multiuser diversity gain. Our results show that the secondary system with a smaller number of transmit antennas N

The proposed transmission line features a lower dispersion as well as the propagation loss than that of the conventional substrate integrated coaxial line (SICL), while the compact size and low crosstalk characteristic of the SICL is maintained. In the experimental validation, time domain parameters, the fidelity and the Euclid distance, are adopted to evaluate the wideband performance of the presented structure. The improvement in dispersion and loss is well validated.
