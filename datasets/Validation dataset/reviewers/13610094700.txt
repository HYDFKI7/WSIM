39049092006	Theory and network applications of dynamic bloom filters	A bloom filter is a simple, space-efficient, randomized data structure for concisely representing a static data set, in order to support approximate membership queries. It has great potential for distributed applications where systems need to share information about what resources they have. The space efficiency is achieved at the cost of a small probability of false positive in membership queries. However, for many applications the space savings and short locating time consistently outweigh this drawback. In this paper, we introduce dynamic bloom filters (DBF) to support concise representation and approximate membership queries of dynamic sets, and study the false positive probability and union algebra operations. We prove that DBF can control the false positive probability at a low level by adjusting the number of standard bloom filters used according to the actual size of current dynamic set. The space complexity is also acceptable if the actual size of dynamic set does not deviate too much from the predefined threshold. Furthermore, we present multi-dimension dynamic bloom filters (MDDBF) to support concise representation and approximate membership queries of dynamic sets in multiple attribute dimensions, and study the false positive probability and union algebra operations through mathematic analysis and experimentation. We also explore the optimization approach and three network applications of bloom filters, namely bloom joins, informed search, and global index implementation. Our simulation shows that informed search based on bloom filters can obtain higher recall and success rate of query than the blind search protocol. © 2006 IEEE.

49249092556	Study of DoD architecture simulation validation based on UML and extended colored Petri nets	Department of Defence Architecture Framework(DoDAF) is an important method to ensure the quality of system design. One way for DoD architecture validation and assess is to transform the DoD architecture products into executable models, then the performance of DoD architecture can be tested through analyzing model execution process and result. Based on the different advantage of UML(Unified Modelling Language) and Petri nets, the paper applies some kinds of views in UML to describe the relative DoD architecture products. Considering the relationship among the products, the UML views for products are transformed into ECPN (Extended Colored Petri Nets) simulation models according to the transformation rules. So the dynamic behavior of system can be displayed by those simulation model, and whether the time-order relation, information flow and system interface is reasonable, or the system function satisfies the military requirement, and the change of system state is correct, can be checked evidently.

72949117506	The dynamic bloom filters	A Bloom filter is an effective, space-efficient data structure for concisely representing a set, and supporting approximate membership queries. Traditionally, the Bloom filter and its variants just focus on how to represent a static set and decrease the false positive probability to a sufficiently low level. By investigating mainstream applications based on the Bloom filter, we reveal that dynamic data sets are more common and important than static sets. However, existing variants of the Bloom filter cannot support dynamic data sets well. To address this issue, we propose dynamic Bloom filters to represent dynamic sets, as well as static sets and design necessary item insertion, membership query, item deletion, and filter union algorithms. The dynamic Bloom filter can control the false positive probability at a low level by expanding its capacity as the set cardinality increases. Through comprehensive mathematical analysis, we show that the dynamic Bloom filter uses less expected memory than the Bloom filter when representing dynamic sets with an upper bound on set cardinality, and also that the dynamic Bloom filter is more stable than the Bloom filter due to infrequent reconstruction when addressing dynamic sets without an upper bound on set cardinality. Moreover, the analysis results hold in stand-alone applications, as well as distributed applications. © 2006 IEEE.

73549090373	Research on dynamic service composition based on object petri net for the networked information system	In contrast to a typical pyramid information system, resources and services in a networked information system are often distributed, published, accessed and updated by multiple service providers. The networked information systems need to support the logistical aspects of business processes at hand. How to invoke these services to satisfy the users' requirement? A lot of research work has been done in the fields of service discovery and service composition. A feasible method is making use of service API schema classification to inquire suitable service, and then designing a workflow mechanism to consume a serial of services on the fly. But this method cannot guarantee the high service recall and precision rate. And up to now there is no appropriate method to realize the dynamic service composition. Object Petri Nets (OPN) are a wellfounded process modeling technique which have been used to model and analyze several types of processes including protocols, manufacturing systems, and business processes. This paper brings forward dynamic service composition based on OPN for networked information system. A service behavior is basically a partial ordered set of operations, which can interact with each other by standard network protocol and interface. The paper brings forward the mapping rules from service to Object Petri Net, based on which the eight tuple description is presented. Secondly the five basic service composition models of sequence, alternative, parallel, arbitrary sequence, iteration are determined, and the mathematical characteristics are studied. Finally the paper brings forward service dynamic composition flow chart. Through the research on dynamic service composition based on OPN, it is adaptable to model and simulate for the networked information system. © 2009 IEEE.

74249106867	BDP: A bloom filters based dissemination protocol in wireless sensor networks	There is a growing need for enabling reprogramming in a working sensor network. Weprefer to meet the requirements remotely instead of collecting all deployed sensors. Identifying the version difference of data items, having the same key, could significantly reduce the communication overhead, because only those out-of-date items should be updated at each sensor. Previous protocols need to exchange multiple messages to identify a version difference between two items with the same key. In this paper, we propose a reliable and energy efficient data dissemination protocol (BDP) with less propagation delay. BDP uses Bloom filters to identify a version difference between two items with the same key, andfind the new one between two items having the same key but different versions. Through comprehensive simulations, we show that BDP outperforms previous work in terms of energy cost and propagation delay of updating new items with high reliability. ©2009 IEEE.

It then utilizes the topological properties of hypercube to realize convenient embedding of parallel algorithms, and the short diameter of Kautz graph to support efficient inter-cluster communication. KCube possesses many attractive characteristics, such as modularity, expansibility, and regularity, while these benefits are achieved at the cost of only increasing the degree of any node by one, regardless of the network size.

84055178109	Seizure prediction based on classification of EEG synchronization patterns with on-line retraining and post-processing scheme	Epilepsy is one of the most common brain disorders in the world. The spontaneous seizure onset influences the daily life of epilepsy patients. The studies on feature extraction and feature classification from Electroencephalography(EEG) signal in seizure prediction methods have shown great improvement these years. However, the variation issue of EEG signal (being awake, being asleep, severity of epilepsy, etc.) poses a fundamental difficulty in seizure prediction problem. The traditional off-line training method trains the model using a fixed training set, and expects the performance of the model to remain stable even after a long period of time, and thus suffers from variation issue. In this paper, we propose an on-line retraining method to leverage the recent input data by gradually enlarging the training set and retraining the model. Also, a simple post-processing scheme is incorporated to reduce false alarms. We develop our method based on the state of the art machine learning based classification of bivariate patterns method. The performance of the method is evaluated on Electrocorticogram(ECoG) recording from Freiburg database as well as long-term scalp EEG recording from CHB-MIT EEG Database and National Taiwan University Hospital. The proposed method achieves 74.2% sensitivity on ECoG database and 52.2% sensitivity on scalp EEG database, while improving the sensitivity of off-line training method by 29.0% and 17.4% in ECoG database and EEG database respectively.

0037359942	Analysis and architecture design of block-coding engine for EBCOT in JPEG 2000	Embedded block coding with optimized truncation (EBCOT) is the most important technology in the latest image-coding standard, JPEG 2000. The hardware design of the block-coding engine in EBCOT is critical because the operations are bit-level processing and occupy more than half of the computation time of the whole compression process. A general purpose processor (GPP) is, therefore, very inefficient to process these operations. In this paper, we present detailed analysis and dedicated hardware architecture of the block-coding engine to execute the EBCOT algorithm efficiently. The context formation process in EBCOT is analyzed to get an insight into the characteristics of the operation. Column-based architecture and two speed-up methods, sample skipping (SS) and group-of-column skipping (GOCS), for the context generation are then proposed. As for arithmetic encoder design, the pipeline and look-ahead techniques are used to speed up the processing. It is shown that about 60% of the processing time is reduced compared with sample-based straightforward implementation. A test chip is designed and the simulation results show that it can process 4.6 million pixels image within 1 s, corresponding to 2400 × 1800 image size, or CIF (352 × 288) 4 : 2 : 0 video sequence with 30 frames per second at 50-MHz working frequency.

That is because many coded bit-streams will be truncated after the rate control of JPEG2000. In this paper, an effective scheme for JPEG2000 rate control is proposed. Through this scheme, the computation complexity for JPEG2000 entropy coding, that is, EBCOT Tier-1, can be greatly reduced almost without paying any penalty on the image quality, especially at lower bit-rate. Moreover, the proposed method is considered to be suitable for the hardware implementation since the existed techniques for the rate control of JPEG2000 are all software-oriented. By the proposed rate control method, a dedicated hardware of JPEG2000 with high-speed processing and effective rate control ability can be achieved.

84870948333	Your Relevance Feedback Is Essential: Enhancing the Learning to Rank Using the Virtual Feature Based Logistic Regression	Information retrieval applications have to publish their output in the form of ranked lists. Such a requirement motivates researchers to develop methods that can automatically learn effective ranking models. Many existing methods usually perform analysis on multidimensional features of query-document pairs directly and don't take users' interactive feedback information into account. They thus incur the high computation overhead and low retrieval performance due to an indefinite query expression. In this paper, we propose a Virtual Feature based Logistic Regression (VFLR) ranking method that conducts the logistic regression on a set of essential but independent variables, called virtual features (VF). They are extracted via the principal component analysis (PCA) method with the user's relevance feedback. We then predict the ranking score of each queried document to produce a ranked list. We systematically evaluate our method using the LETOR 4.0 benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposal outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the Mean Average Precision (MAP), the Precision at position k (P@k), and the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at position k (NDCG@k). © 2012 Cai et al.

84872257040	Enhancing the learning to rank using the virtual feature logistic regression with relevance feedback	Many information retrieval applications have to publish their outputs in the form of ranked lists, in which documents must be sorted in descending order according to their relevance to a given query. Many existing methods perform analysis on multidimensional features distilled from query-document pairs directly and don't take user's interactive feedback into account; hence, they incur a high computation overhead and a low retrieval performance due to inaccurate query expression. In this paper, we propose a Virtual Feature Logistic Regression (VFLR) method that conducts the logistic regression on a set of crucial but independent variables, called virtual features (VF), which are extracted by the principal component analysis (PCA) with the user's relevance feedback. We then predict the ranking score of each queried document to produce a ranked list. We systematically evaluate our method using the MQ2008 dataset. The experimental results validate that the VFLR method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the Mean Average Precision (MAP), the Precision at position k (P@k), and the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at position k (NDCG@k). © 2012 Dunarea de Jos University.

84875937608	A generalised Little's law and its applications for a discrete-time G/D/1 queue with correlated arrivals	The discrete-time G/D/1 queues with serially correlated batch arrivals and unit service times have wide applications in modern telecommunication systems. Despite the rich literature in their performance analysis, no simple formula on the relation between system size and sojourn time is known. We show that for this specific type of queues, the Little's law can be extended to higher moments. The benefit of this generalised result is that once the moments of either performance measure are available, those of the other will be obtained simultaneously. This result is applied to a particular example of OO-G/D/1 system, where the mean, variance, and skewness of the sojourn delay are derived in closed-form. Numerical examples are given to examine how the correlation influences these performance measures. © 2013 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.

84876021473	Friendship prediction in recommender system	As the fast development of the Internet scale, "data overload" has become one of the most critical problems in computer network analysis. Recommender system has been regarded as the most effective method to solve the problem. But most of existing methods just consider the independent feedback of users without considering the relationship between users, which will inevitably decrease the performance of recommender system. Thus, a friendship prediction algorithm for recommender system was proposed to predict the relationship between different users. Firstly the topological and historical interaction information was taken as the features to judge the existence and relationship type of links. Then the feature combination process based on linear regression algorithm and logistic regression algorithm was implemented. Finally, the experiments based on the real data sets of Epinions and Slashdot were implemented. The experiment results show that our approaches perform very well in link prediction problem.

84876059855	KMcube: The compound of Kautz digraph and Möbius cube	This paper introduces a novel interconnection network called KMcube (Kautz-Möbius cube). KMcube is a compound graph of a Kautz digraph and Möbius cubes. That is, it uses the Möbius cubes as the unit cluster and connects many such clusters by means of a Kautz digraph at the cost of only one additional arc being added to any node in each Möbius cubes. The topological benefits of both basic graphs are preserved in the compound network. It utilizes the topological properties of Möbius cubes to conveniently embed parallel algorithms into each cluster and the short diameter of a Kautz digraph to support efficient inter-cluster communication. Additionally, KMcube provides other attractive properties, such as the regularity, symmetry, and expandability. The proposed methodology for KMcube is further applied to the compound graphs of Kautz digraph and other Möbius-like graphs with the similar diameter to a Möbius cube. Moreover, other hybrid graphs of Kautz digraph and Möbius cubes are proposed and compared. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84877579595	A Bloom filters based dissemination protocol in wireless sensor networks	There is a growing need for enabling reprogramming a working sensor network in unattended area. We prefer to meet the requirements remotely by disseminating parameters instead of collecting all deployed sensors. Identifying the version differences of parameters on different sensor nodes can significantly reduce the communication overhead, because only those out-of-date ones need to be updated. In this paper, we propose BDP, a Bloom filter based data dissemination protocol for wireless sensor networks. Using Bloom filters as compact storage of the version information of data items, BDP efficiently identifies the version differences among data items with the same key and guarantees network-wide consistency with high reliability. Testbed experiment and simulation results demonstrate that BDP outperforms the existing schemes with low energy cost, short propagation delay of updating new items, and high reliability. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84879131750	Learning to rank based on user relevance feedback	Many information retrieval applications have to present their results in the form of ranked lists, in which documents must be sorted in a descending order according to their relevance to a given query. This has led the interest of the information retrieval community in methods that automatically learn effective ranking models, and recently machine learning techniques have also been applied to model construction. Most of the existing methods do not take into consideration the fact that significant homogeneity exists between query-document pairs related to user's feedback. In this research, a novel method which clusters patterns in the training data with their relevance from the user, and then uses the discovered rules to rank documents at query-time. A systematic evaluation of the proposed method using the LETOR benchmark dataset is posposed. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with no need of time-consuming and laborious pre-processing.

84880275191	Enterprise Architecture benefits: The divergence between desirability and realizability in EA implementation	Nowadays Enterprise Architecture (EA) is receiving considerable attention both from academia and industry. In this paper we articulate and validate EA benefits by investigating desirability and realizability in EA implementation. By conducting a theoretical analysis and an empirical study it is found that EA benefits are claimed differently from different perspectives by different claimers. Based on this research, which focusses on desirability and realizability of EA benefits, the results reveal that there really exists a paradox between the desirability and realizability: the most desirable EA benefits are not always simultaneously the most realizable, and vice versa. This study contributes by providing the EA community with a classification of EA benefits that facilitates a more comprehensive and more realistic understanding towards EA benefits.

84889842936	A map reduce scheme for image feature extraction and its application to man-made object detection	A fundamental challenge in image engineering is how to locate interested objects from high-resolution images with efficient detection performance. Several man-made objects detection approaches have been proposed while the majority of these methods are not truly timesaving and suffer low degree of detection precision. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach for man-made object detection in aerial image involving MapReduce scheme for large scale image analysis to support image feature extraction, which can be widely used to compute-intensive tasks in a highly parallel way, and texture feature extraction and clustering. Comprehensive experiments show that the parallel framework saves voluminous time for feature extraction with satisfied objects detection performance. © 2013 SPIE.

84904568178	Recommending items via interest-similar cluster identification in online social networks	Social network has played a more and more important role in recommender system as users are strongly influenced by their friends. But the friend lists of a user are always hidden for privacy concern. Even her friend lists are accessible, there still exist many potential friends who have similar interest with her but she doesn't know. How to predict the friendship she knows and does not know when the friend lists are hidden? How to identify her interest? To address the above questions, we first propose a Friendship prediction approach mainly based on the analysis of her group information. Secondly, we propose a graph model which simultaneously models user's friendship and interest. Then we propose an unbiased random walk strategy for item recommendation via the graph model. Finally, we evaluate our approach on large scale real world data from Cite Like and last.fm data set, the results show that the performance of our algorithms is very good in implementation. © 2013 IEEE.

84903995667	A new DHT supporting multi-attribute queries for grid information services	Recent structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems can't be simply applied to grid information services, because grid resources need to be registered and searched using multiple attributes. This paper proposes a multi-attribute addressable DHT (MAA-DHT) for grid information services. It uses hypercube as its logical graph and provides a new resource placement mechanism based on the values of all attributes, and then supports query based on all attributes and part attributes. The join of a new object and object query operation based on all attributes can be finished within O (log N) hops for N peers. Then, this paper proposes the lookup algorithm based on global index, the corresponding query delay is still O (log N) hops. In particular, in order to maintain the topology, this paper designs a novel stabilization protocol for the MAA-DHT, which also can implement and maintain the global index within O (2 log N) rounds. Furthermore, in order to save storage and query time of the global index, we propose the informed lookup mechanism based on bloom filters, the query based on part attributes still can be finished within O (log N) hops. © 2013 IEEE.

84905282400	Analysis and design of on-sensor ECG processors for realtime detection of cardiac anomalies including VF, VT, and PVC	Cardiovascular disease remains the main cause of death, and great efforts are spent on the design of ECG (electrocardiogram) body sensors these years. Essential components such as analog frontend and wireless transceivers have been integrated on a compact IC with micro-Watt power consumption. To provide timely warning against the fatal vascular signs, based on the Chaotic Phase Space Differential (CPSD) algorithm, heterogeneous VLSI processors are implemented and integrated to extract the abnormal ECG characteristics for VF (Ventricular Fibrillation), VT (Ventricular Tachycardia) and PVC (Premature Ventricular Contraction). The on-sensor processing reduces 98.0% power of wireless data transmission for raw ECG signals. The application specific processor is designed to accelerate CPSD algorithm with 1.7μW power while the OpenRISC is integrated to provide the system flexibility. The architecture is realized on the FPGA platform to demonstrate the detection of the abnormal ECG signals in realtime. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

84908298448	Analysis and architecture design of JPEG2000	Analysis and architecture design of the key modules in JPEG2000 are presented in this paper. For Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a lifting based DWT core for the default 5-3 and 9-7 filters in part I of JPEG2000 is proposed. Folded architecture is adopted in DWT to reduce the hardware cost and to achieve the higher hardware utilization. For Embedded Block Coding with Optimized Truncation (EBCOT), column-based coding architecture of Tier-1 block coding engine is proposed. The context formation efficiency is increased by adopting two speedup methods. The computation cycle of the block coding engine is reduced to about 40% of previous work.
