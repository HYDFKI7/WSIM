1542379085	Establishment and identification of a chemically inducible dimerization model for high throughout screening	Objective: To establish and identify an inducible apoptosis cell model for high throughout drug screening. Methods: Full-length Bax gene amplified from 3T3 cell lines was determined by sequence analysis followed by cloning into pC4FV1E. The resulting recombinant plasmid pC4FV1E/BAX was then introduced into HEK293 by Lipofectin. Cell clones stably expressing FKBP12-mBAX fusion proteins were characterized by RT-PCR and Western blot. The effect of inducible apoptosis on cell clones by AP20187 was analyzed by morphological and flow cytometric detection. Above all, competition assays proved the feasibility of such a cell model as a technique for high throughout drug screening. Results: The integration and expression of FKBP12-mBAX fusion gene were identified by RT-PCR and Western blot respectively. Giemsa staining showed apoptosis bodies after induced by AP20187 for 4-6 hours. On the other hand, the detection of typical "DNA ladder" proved the activation of CAD (caspase-activated DNase). FK506 could competitively block such cell apoptosis induced by AP20187. Conclusion: The inducible apoptosis cell model was successfully established, which offered an applicable technical platform for the high throughout screening of FK506-like small molecular compounds.

17044364971	Structure-based design and characterization of a novel IL-6 antagonist peptide	The development of rational methods to design antagonist peptides based on the 3-D structure of protein active region has, to now, been only marginally successful. This has been largely due to the difficulty of constraining the recognition elements of a mimetic structure to the relative conformational and spatial orientations present in the parent molecule. According to the 3-D complex structure of human interleukin-6 (hIL-6) and its receptor (hIL-6R), a novel antagonist peptide (named PT), which possessed potential bioactivity of hIL-6, was designed by the means of distance geometry, molecular modeling and molecular dynamics trajectory analysis. The bioactivity of the designed peptide (i.e. PT) was evaluated using XG-7 cells, a hIL-6-dependent B-cell line. PT possessed potential bioactivity to antagonize the function of hIL-6 and could efficiently induce the growth arrest and apoptosis of XG-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

19544374106	A study on the expression of BRCA1 & P53 and their correlation in epithelial ovarian cancer	Objectives: To study the expressions of BRCA1 and p53 in epithelial ovarian cancer and their clinical significance. Methods: BRCA1 and p53 protein expressions were detected in 50 epithelial ovarian cancers. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the relationship between their expressions and prognosis. Results: 1, The expression rate of BRCA1 was 30.0% in ovarian cancers, which was lower than that in benign tumor and normal ovary tissues significantly (P<0.01). And BRCA1 expression was correlated with pathological grade and pelvic lymph node metastasis. 2, The expression rate of p53 was 64.0%, while the expression was negative in benign tumor and normal ovary tissues, and it related to pathological grade. 3, There was negative correlation between the expressions of the two protein (P<0.01). 4, The mean survival time was longer in the patients with BRCA1 expression than those without. There was no effect of p53 on survival time. Conclusions: Down-regulation of BRCA1 gene in post-transcription plays a very important role in the occurrence and the development of ovarian cancer, and p53 gene maybe has a synergetic role with BRCA1 to promote tumor progression.

20844450046	Two-dimensional electrophoresis protein profiling as an analytical tool for human acute leukemia classification	Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to profile the proteins of leukemic cells from 61 cases of akute leukemia (AL) characterized by the French-American-British (FAB) classification. The differentially expressed protein spots were identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDITOF-MS) and electrospray ionization-tandem MS (ESI-MS/MS). The distinct protein profiles (DPPs) of AL FAB subtypes were explored successfully, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), its subtypes (M2, M3, and M5), and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), which were homogeneous within different samples of the same subgroup but clearly differed from all other subgroups. We also found a group of proteins differentially expressed between AL cells and normal white blood cells. Among the DPPs of AL subtypes, some proteins have been reported, but most of them were first reported here to mark AML differentiation and to discriminate AML from ALL. These data show that 2-DE protein profiling could be used as an analytical tool for facilitating molecular definition of human AL classification and understanding the mechanism of leukemogensis, and the extension of the present analysis to the currently less well-defined AL will identify additional subgroups and may promote the identification of new targets for specific treatment approaches. © 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

20144379148	Proteomic analysis of interleukin 6-induced differentiation in mouse myeloid leukemia cells	Cytokine-induced differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells has important therapeutic implications, but the mechanism remains to be clarified. M1 cell, a mouse acute myeloid leukemia cell line, which underwent growth inhibition, terminal differentiation and apoptosis in response to IL-6, was selected as an experimental model to study on the molecular mechanisms of myeloid cell differentiation on a proteome-wide scale. Cell differentiation was evaluated by cell morphology and CD11b expression. With two-dimensional (2D) gel analyses, 17 protein spots showed obvious changes in quantity during the process of differentiation were found. With matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) or/and nano-electrospray ionization MS/MS (ESI-MS/MS) analysis, 15 protein spots were identified. The mRNA levels of these 15 proteins during differentiation were also examined using a semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Except two proteins, the mRNA levels demonstrated similar expression patterns to what the proteomic analysis revealed. The identified proteins were known to be involved in different cellular functions, including protein synthesis, transcription, signal transduction, cell cycle control, cell rescue and defense, cellular organization, and metabolism. Notably, seven proteins were not described before to be involved in differentiation. Our data provide novel information for a better understanding of the mechanisms by which terminal differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells induced by IL-6. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

2442685708	Bcl-2 inhibitors sensitize tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis by uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration in human leukemic CEM cells	Previous studies have shown that the lymphoblastic leukemia CEM cell line is resistant to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis because of a low expression of caspase-8. Bcl-2 inhibitors, BH3I-2′ and HA14-1, are small cell-permeable nonpeptide compounds, are able to induce apoptosis by mediating cytochrome c release, and also lead to dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). This study aimed to use the Bcl-2 inhibitors to sensitize CEM cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by switching on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. We found that a low dose of BH3I-2′ or HA14-1, which did not induce cytochrome c release, greatly sensitized CEM cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In a similar manner to the classical uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), both BH3I-2′ and HA14-1 induced a reduction in ΔΨm, a generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an increased mitochondrial respiration, and a decreased ATP synthesis. This uncoupling function of the Bcl-2 inhibitors was responsible for the synergy with TRAIL-induced apoptosis. CCCP per se did not induce apoptosis but again sensitized CEM cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by uncoupling mitochondrial respiration. The uncoupling effect facilitated TRAIL-induced Bax conformational change and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Inhibition of caspases failed to block TRAIL-mediated cell death when mitochondrial respiration was uncoupled. We observed that BH3I-2′, HA14-1, or CCCP can overcome resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant cell lines, such as CEM, HL-60, and U937. Our results suggest that the uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration can sensitize leukemic cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, caspase activation per se does not represent an irreversible point of commitment to TRAIL-induced cell death when mitochondrial respiration is uncoupled.

2342598316	The difference of binding epitopes on human CD16 (FcγRIII) interacted with hIgG1 and monoclonal antibody B88-9	The 3-D complex structures of extracellular domain of human CD16 (FcγRIII) and hIgG1 or B88-9 were obtained by means of computer-guided molecular modeling, respectively. The binding epitopes were predicted and binding energy was calculated theoretically. The epitopes of human CD16 interacted with hIgG1 and B88-9 were different and the binding energy of B88-9 was stronger than hIgG1. The computer competing simulation results showed that B88-9 could bind to CD16 when CD16 was also bound by hIgG1, while IgG1 could not bind to CD16 after CD16 was bound by B88-9. By flow cytometry analysis, the competitive binding activity of B88-9 to CD16 with hIgG1 was evaluated. With the increasing concentrations of hIgG1, the binding activity of B88-9 was not interfered markedly. It suggested that hIgG1 could not inhibit the interaction of CD16 and B88-9 and the binding domain of hIgG1 and B88-9 on CD16 was different. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

23844544041	Enhanced maturation and functional capacity of dendritic cells induced by mannosylated L2 domain of ErbB2 receptor	The nature of antigens and functional state of dendritic cells (DC) are important in antigen presentation. The ability of DC for the induction of T-cell responses is promoted by maturation. It has been confirmed that mannose receptors mediate highly efficient endocytosis and presentation of mannosylated proteins. In the present study, L2 domain of ErbB2 ectodomain was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and mannosylated. The maturation and functional capacity of DC induced by mannosylated L2 (mL2) protein were investigated. The results showed that L2 protein could induce DC maturation, which was accompanied by elevated expression of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules. The effect of mL2 protein on DC maturation was more remarkable than that of non-mL2 proteins. Uptake of mL2 antigens by DC was more efficient. Furthermore, the T cells can be stimulated to proliferate in vitro and secrete Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Higher levels of both IFN-γ and IL-10 were detected from the T cells stimulated by mL2-pulsed DC, suggesting a concurrent activation of CD4

27744472328	In vivo identification of the interaction site of ErbB2 extracellular domain with its autoinhibitor	Direct interference with the transforming potential of ErbB2 has become a subject of great interest. Disruption of critical ErbB2 ectodomain interactions may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of various tumors. The ErbB receptor signaling can be inhibited by rationally designed peptide mimetics based on the subdomains of ErbB ectodomain. The mimetics can bind to the ErbB receptor specifically and block inter-receptor interactions, resulting in the growth inhibition of ErbB2-overexpressing cells in vitro. In this study, three-dimensional structure of herstatin, an autoinhibitor of ErbB2 and ErbB2 ectodomain complex was constructed by computer-aided molecular modeling. The binding site on ErbB2 ectodomain for herstatin was determined at S1 domain. The mutants of ErbB2 ectodomain were constructed. The interactions of ErbB2 ectodomain and its mutants with herstatin were analyzed for the first time in living cells that coexpressed herstatin and ErbB2 ectodomain or the mutants. The S1 domain in ErbB2 ectodomain was verified as the interaction site with herstatin by immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The binding region of herstatin on ErbB2 ectodomain might be a potential target region for the drug design. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

28444432735	Controlled growth of Chinese hamster ovary cells and high expression of antibody-IL-2 fusion proteins by temperature manipulation	Growth and the expression of the anti-ErbB2 scFv-Fc-IL2 fusion protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were in association at 37°C. The expression of the fusion protein was no more than 25 μg/ml. At 30°C the cell growth was arrested but the cells continued to produce the fusion protein up to 60-80 μg/ml. About 50% of CHO cells were rapidly blocked in G2/M phase after the temperature was shifted from 37 to 30°C. Lowering temperature resulted in cell growth arrest, but maintained cell viability for a longer time and enhanced the production of the antibody-IL-2 fusion protein in CHO cells. © Springer 2005.

28644442984	Proteomics-based identification of human acute leukemia antigens that induce humoral immune response	The identification of panels of tumor antigens that elicit an antibody response may have utility in cancer screening, diagnosis, and establishing prognosis. Until now, autoimmunity in cancer has been mainly revealed in solid tumors. The aim of this study was to apply the proteomic approach to the identification of proteins that commonly elicit a humoral response in acute leukemia (AL). Sera from 21 newly diagnosed patients with AL, 20 patients with solid tumors, and 22 noncancer controls were analyzed for antibody-based reactivity against AL proteins resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis. As a result, autoantibody against a protein identified by mass spectrometry as Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 was detected in sera from 15 of 21 patients with AL (71%). By contrast, such antibody was detected in sera from one of 20 patients with solid tumors (5%) and one of 22 noncancer controls (4.5%). Five other protein autoantibodies were also found in AL patients with a high frequency and constituted the major target antigens of the AL autoimmune response. The findings of autoantibodies against Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 and other proteins in sera of patients with AL suggest that the proteomic approach we have implemented may have utility for the development of a serum-based assay for AL screening and diagnosis. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

30344459721	The potential mechanisms of leukemic cell apoptosis induced by BH3 mimic analogue BH3I-2′	Objective: To explore the potential mechanisms of BH3 mimic analogue BH3I-2′-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells and to offer evidence for clinical application of the and -cancer drugs. Methods: The flow cytometry, ELISA and Western blotting methods were applied to detect the apoptosis and change of mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS generation, activity of NF-κB, expression of Bcl-XL and Survivin proteins in K562 and CEM cells after treatment with BH3I-2′. Results: The apoptosis in leukemic cells was significantly induced by BH3I-2′, thus resulting in decrease of mitochondrial Δψm, generation of ROS and up-regulation of NF-κB and anti-apoptosis proteins (Bcl-XL, Survivin). Conclusions: Through the damages of mitochondrial inner membrane by causing the collapse of mitochondrial Δψm and the generation of ROS, the BH3I-2′ could induce apoptosis by the mitochondrial pathway. Furthermore it can activate the NF-κB and anti-apoptosis proteins simultaneously. So we should also pay more attention on the cell-self-protective mechanisms when the drugs induce the apoptosis.

32644458214	Sequestering ErbB2 in endoplasmic reticulum by its autoinhibitor from translocation to cell surface: An autoinhibition mechanism of ErbB2 expression	ErbB2 is differentially overexpressed in tumor versus host tissues, suggesting that an autoregulation mechanism may modulate the expression of ErbB2 and control cell growth. A truncated ErbB2 extracellular domain, herstatin has been shown to bind to ErbB2 and inhibit the growth of tumor cells expressing ErbB2. In the present study, the interaction of herstatin and ErbB2 in vivo was observed by confocal microscopy. The aggregation of ErbB2 and herstatin was found in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The decrease of ErbB2 on the cell surface was accompanied with the increased colocalization of ErbB2 and herstatin in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the formation of ErbB2/herstatin complex may prevent transit from ER to cell surface of ErbB2. The formation of ErbB2 and herstatin complex was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation. The results demonstrate that sequestering ErbB2 molecules intracellularly by herstatin may be a possible mechanism of the cell growth inhibition. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

31544444143	Relationship between insulin resistance and erythrocyte insulin receptors in patients with cerebral infarction	Background: Epidemiologic studies have shown an association between higher insulin levels and coronary artery disease, and metabolic studies have associated insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and lipid disorders. Objective: To investigate the relationship between ins ulin resistance (IR) and erythrocyte insulin receptors (EIRs) in the patients with cerebral infarction (CI). Design: Case-control trial. Setting: Depart ment of Neurology, China-Ja pan Union Hospital of Jilin University. Participants: From January 2004 to October 2004, 40 patient s with CI, who were in-patients in China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, were selected for the study. Meanwhile, 30 healthy doctors or nurses were recruited as normal controls. Methods: The levels of blood glucose and serum insulin under fasting and 2-hour after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were detected in the 40 patients with CI and 30 healthy doctors or nurses. Fasting blood glucose multiplied by fasting serum insulin was insulin resistance index (IRI). The number of insulin receptors and their binding affinity on every erythrocyte were determined using modified Gambhir's method. The correlation between the number of EIRs and IRI was analyzed. Main outco me measures: Comparison of CI group with control group in: 1 the level of blood glucose, serum insulin under fasting and 2-hour after OGTT; 2 IRI; 3 EIRs. Results: Data of 40 patients with CI and 30 contro ls were analyzed, and none was lost. 1 Comparisons of the level of blood glucose, serum insulin under fasting and 2-hour after OGTT: The level of serum insulin under fasting and blood glucose, serum insulin at 2-hour after OGTT in CI group were higher than those in normal group [(13.30±5.15), (9.85±4.36) mU/L, (8.27±1.65), (6.32±1.37) mmol/L, (75.21±91.12), (28.26±6.31)mU/L,P < 0.01, P < 0.001]. 2 Comparison of IRI: IRI in CI group was higher than that in normal group (68.69±22.91, 48.36±10.16, P < 0.001). 3 Analysis of EIRs: The number of insulin receptors with high and low affinity and maximum specific binding rate in the patients with CI were significantly less than those in normal group [20.30±4.50, 23.80±4.10; 2 223.80±509.30, 2 610.10±435.10; (10.62±3.55)%, (13.21±2.94)%, P < 0.01]. Multiple linear regression analysis and correlation analysis showed the numbers of two types of EIRs in the patients with CI were negatively correlated with IRI (r=-0.458, -0.439, P < 0.01, both). Conclusion: Insulin resistance can lead to cerebral in farction. Decrease in insulin receptors may play an importance role in cerebral infarction induced by insulin resistance.

Cultured PC12 cells were divided into three groups: 1 Normal control group: PC12 cells were incubated in DMEM containing the fetal bovine serum with 0.25 volume fraction; 2 Edaravone pre-treatment group: Edaravone at 20 μmol/L concentration was pre-processed for 12 hours, then 30 μmol/L Aβ25-35 was added in the culture solution for 24 hours. 3 Aβ25-35 intervention group: The Aβ25-35 at 30 μmol /L concentration was incubated for 24 hours. Survival rate of PC12 cells was detected by MTT assays; The contents of protein carbonyl and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were detected by ELISA, and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) was detected by thiobarbituric acid method. Results: 1 Survival rate of PC12 cells in the three groups: That of the normal control group was (100.0±5.7)%, and that of the edaravone pre-treatment group was significantly higher than that of Aβ25-35 intervention group [(86.4±17.7)%, (42.5±9.4)%, P < 0.001]. 2 Contents of intracellular protein carbonyl: That of the normal control group was (0.35±0.09) μmol/g. It was lower in the edaravone pre-treatment group than that in the Aβ25-35 intervention group [(0.41±0.12),(0.81±0.17) μmol/g,P < 0.01]. 3 Comparison of levels of AGEs and MDA: It was (12.21±3.26) mg/L in the normal control group. It was lower obviously in the edaravone pre-treatment group than that in the Aβ25-35 intervention group [(14.65±4.25),(26.57 ±5.18)mg/L,P < 0.01]. 4 Concentration of MDA: It was (4.11±0.98) μmol/L in the normal control group. It was lower obviously in the edaravone pre-treatment group than that in the Aβ25-35 intervention group [(4.92±1.30), (7.58±1.01) μmol/L,P< 0.01]. Conclusion: Edaravone is characteristic of neuroprote ctive effect, which can reduce the content of protein oxidative product, AGEs and lipid oxidative end product in the PC12 cells induced by Aβ25-35.

33645107271	Inhibitory effect of antisense vascular endothelial growth factor RNA on the profile of hepatocellular carcinoma cell line in vitro and in vivo	Aim: To evaluate the effect of antisense vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) RNA (PCMV-FGEV) transfection on the profile of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) SMMC-7721 cells in vitro and in vivo. Methods: SMMC-7721 cells were transfected with PCMV-FGEV antisense, PCMV-VEGF sense and empty vector plasmid encapsulated by lipofectamine as antisense group, sense group and control group respectively. The positive cell clones were selected with G418. The stable transfection and expression of VEGF in the cells were determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Cell proliferation was observed by MTT assay. FACS analysis was used to determine the effect of PCMV-FGEV transfection on cell apoptosis. The growth of transfected cells in vivo was also observed in nude mice. Results: VEGF expression was reduced in SMMC-7721 transfected with PCMV-FGEV, which was confirmed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. No effect of PCMV-FGEV transfection was found on cell proliferation and cell apoptosis of SMMC-7721 in vitro. The growth of cells transfected with PCMV-FGEV was slow in nude mice and accompanied with obvious apoptosis. The latent time of tumors in the antisense group was 25.0±1.8 d, which was longer than that in sense and control groups (F=19.455, P<0.01). The average tumor weight in antisense group (0.96 g±0.28 g) was the smallest among the three groups (F=21.501, P<0.01). Conclusion: The expression of VEGF can be inhibited by antisense PCMV-FGEV. Antisense PCMV-FGEV has no effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis of SMMC-7721 in vitro but can inhibit tumor growth and induce cell apoptosis in vivo. © 2006 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

33646067128	Effects of insulin-like growth factor 1 on the learning and memory abilities of dementia model rats as well as the expression of synaptophysin	Aim: To study the effects of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) on the learning and memory abilities of dementia rats and the protective effects on synaptophysin. Methods: The experiment was carried out in the laboratory of Department of Neurology, First Hospital of Jilin University from March 2004 to June 2005. Thirty normal learning ability male Wistar rats aged three or four months being selected by Morris water maze were randomly divided into the dementia treatment group, dementia control group and the normal control group with 10 rats in each group. The diazoma-hippocampus cholinergic system impaired dementia models were established by transecting bilateral fornix-fimbria. Rats in the dementia treatment group received lateral ventricle infusion of recombinant human 110 μL, (4 g/L) IGF1 for the 21 days preceding sacrifice. The rats in the dementia control group received 21 days of 10 μL saline before sacrifice. The rats in the normal control group were not being treated. The learning and memory abilities were measured by Morris water maze. Latency and times of striding over platform were observed. Praxiology change was observed with Y-maze, using trying times and correct reaction times as analysis index. All the rats were fixed with 40 g/L citromint with heart perfusion 12 days after building models to gain brain, coronary slice continuously. The expression of synaptophysin in rat brains was detected by immunohistochemical method and image analysis. Five pieces of slices of every animal were obtained. Callosal absorbance (A) was regarded as background in the same slice. Hippocampus and frontal lobe were got, respectively to test the A value and gain its mean value. T-test was used to compare among groups. Results: One rat died in both of the dementia treatment group and the dementia control group during the experiment, and the others were all involved in the result analysis. 1 The learning and memory abilities were significantly ameliorated in the dementia treatment group as compared with the dementia control group. The latency in the dementia treatment group was shorter markedly than that in the dementia control group, and had significant difference [(31.02±2.65), (45.32±6.57)s, t=6.056, P < 0.011]. The times of striding over platform were more significantly than that in the dementia control group, and had significant difference [(4.36±1.02), (2.35 ±0.76) times,t=4.213,P < 0.01]. The trying times were less remarkably than that in the dementia control group, and had significant difference [(18.67±1.86),(25.16±2.42) times,t=6.382,P < 0.01]. The correct reaction times were more obviously than that in the dementia treatment group, and had significant difference [(6.78±0.53),(3.97±0.45) times,t=12.112, P < 0.01]. 2 The expression of hippocampal synaptophysin in the dementia treatment group increased distinctly as compared with the dementia control group, and had significant difference [(23.92±2.76), (10.95±3.05), t=9.460, P <0.01]. The expression of synaptophysin of frontal lobe increased clearly as compared with the dementia control group, and had significant difference [(17.69±2.34), (6.58±1.02),t=13.055, P < 0.01). The expression of synaptophysin of brain in the dementia treatment group did not reach the level in the normal control group (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The IGF 1 has protective effect on the central cholinergic system and can improve the learning and memory abilities.

33646816731	Effects of inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway on human primary leukemic cells	Though there were a lot of reports about the totally different responses to the inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in different kinds of cell lines, much less has been known about the responses in primary human leukemic cells. In this study, the effects of inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway on human bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells (MNCs) obtained from 10 normal persons and 8 leukemia patients were examined. The results showed that the responses obviously varied individually. Among them, BM MNCs in 3 cases of leukemic patients were extremely sensitive, demonstrated by that >90% cells were induced to undergo apoptosis within 24 h, but MNCs in 10 cases of normal persons showed resistance to the inhibition and no apoptosis was observed. Furthermore, Western blots revealed that the Bcl-2 expression was relatively high in the sensitive primary leukemia cells, and especially the cleavage of 26 ku Bcl-2 into a 22 ku fragment occurred during the induction of apoptosis. In contrast, the Bcl-2 expression was either undetectable or detectable but no cleavage of that above was observed in the cells insensitive to the inhibition of the pathway (including BM MNCs in normal persons). Together with the observations on the leukemic cell lines, these findings suggested the correlation of the specific cleavage of Bcl-2 into a shortened fragment with the sensitivity of cells to the inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which provides clues to the further understanding of the mechanisms of that dramatically different responses existing in different kinds of cells to the inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

33646848776	A novel cis-acting element in Her2 promoter regulated by Stat3 in mammary cancer cells	Stat3 plays important roles in the development of breast malignancies and oncogenesis. In the present study, a palindromic cis-acting element displaying repression activity in breast cancer cells expressing low level of Her2 was found in Her2 promoter. Deletion analysis showed that the novel element was located within Pal2 region spanning nucleotides -529 to -505. The sequence analysis of Pal2 region revealed a DNA sequence (TTAAGATAA) homologous to the binding site of Stat3, starting from position -529 to -521 bp. By reporter assay, Pal2 was found to be regulated by constitutive activated Stat3C. A stimulatory effect both on Her2 mRNA and protein expressions was observed in MCF-7 cells stably expressing Stat3C, suggesting that Stat3 regulated Her2 expression. Using ChIP assays the binding of Stat3 to Her2 promoter was confirmed. The data obtained in this study indicate constitutive activated Stat3 regulates Her2 expression. Further investigation of differential effects of Stat3 exerting on breast cancer cells expressing Her2 at different levels will provide more insights into the roles of Stat3 in Her2 expression as well as the regulation of diverse biological activities. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33646452781	Preparation and characterization of a monoclonal antibody against human B lymphocyte stimulator	B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family. It is required for B cell development. Deregulation of BLyS was involved in the pathogenesis of B cell-related autoimmune diseases and multiple myeloma. To prepare monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against BLyS, cDNA encoding soluble BLyS (sBLyS) was first amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with specific primers, and then inserted into a prokaryotic expression vector pET-30a. Right recombinant plasmid was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Isolated sBLys was used as an antigen to immunize mice. Splenocytes of one immunized mouse were fused with NS-1. Hybridomas secreting antibodies against sBLyS were identified by ELISA. One positive clone was selected to produce antibody by injecting the hybridoma into the peritoneal cavity of mice. After collecting ascites, the antibody was purified by protein A affinity chromatography. Western blot and immunoflourescence demonstrated that the antibody could bind recombinant sBLyS and genuine membrane-bound BLyS (mBLyS) on U937. This MAb can be used as a detecting reagent to analyze the serum level of BLyS in patients with autoimmune diseases and the expression profile of mBLyS on multiple myeloma cells. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

33748777096	The rational designed antagonist derived from the complex structure of interleukin-6 and its receptor affectively blocking interleukin-6 might be a promising treatment in multiple myeloma	Human interleukin-6 is involved in the maintenance and progression of several diseases such as multiple myeloma (MM), rheumatoid arthritis, or osteoporosis. Our previous work demonstrated that an interleukin-6 antagonist peptide (named PT) possessed potential bioactivity to antagonize the function of hIL-6 and could efficiently induce the growth arrest and apoptosis of XG-7 and M1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In this study, the theoretical interaction of the peptide PT with its receptor was analyzed further more with molecular docking and molecular dynamics methods. The theoretical studies showed that PT possessed very high affinity to interleukin-6R and offered a practical means of imposing long-term blockade of interleukin-6 activity in vivo. According to the theoretical results, the biological evaluation of PT was researched on two different cells models with more sensitive approaches: (1) The antagonist activity of PT was studied on the interleukin-6 dependent MM cells (XG-7) cultured with interleukin-6. In the other interleukin-6 dependent MM cells (SKO-007), they survived themselves by auto/paracrine without the exogenous interleukin-6, and also could be antagonized by PT. The therapeutic value of PT only limited on the interleukin-6 dependent category in MM. (2) Myeloid leukemia M1 cells were induced for growth arrest and apoptosis in response to interleukin-6. The results supported our previous findings and showed that PT could be evaluated by protecting the cells from interleukin-6 induced apoptosis. In conclusion, PT could induce interleukin-6-dependent XG-7 and SKO-007 cells to apoptosis while inhibit interleukin-6-stimulated apoptosis in M1 cells. © 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

33748448082	Underground thermal energy storage and its effect on ground source heat pump system	The state-of-the-art of the underground thermal energy storage (UTES) and the basic problems faced by its development in the future were summarized, including the investigation of mechanisms, the characteristics of the unsteady heat transfer in a complex underground environment, and the control strategy of the UTES system. Through the experimental investigation and the model simulation of the heat transfer in the vertical borehole heat exchanger in a ground source heat pump system, the effect of the UTES was studied. Results show that the UTES changes the energy level and the temperature distribution which are changing with time. It is suggested to further improve the investigation of the UTES by both the experiments and the modeling to promote its application for the future, especially in China.

33748567133	Proteomics-based identification of autoantibodies in the sera of healthy Chinese individuals from Beijing	The identification of panels of tumor antigens that elicit an antibody response may have utility in cancer screening, diagnosis and in establishing prognosis. However, autoantibodies normally exist in sera of healthy individuals and are enormously diversified. To explore the reservoir of autoantibody in healthy population, we performed a proteomics investigation of autoantibody profiles in the sera of 36 healthy Chinese individuals from Beijing, which may provide valuable reference information to the identification of disease-specific autoantibodies. The results showed that autoantibody profiles varied individually, but some autoantibodies were identified at a high frequency in the healthy population. The autoantibodies against α-enolase and those against heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L were positive in more than 50% of the sera samples. The autoantibodies identified in more than 20% of samples included those against annexin II, F-actin capping protein beta subunit and calreticulin. Some of these autoantibodies have been previously reported to be involved in autoimmune conditions and cancers. Autoantibodies in the healthy population are important as a foundation from which disease-specific autoantibodies can be defined. Thus our report on autoantibodies in healthy individuals may be useful as a reference for defining new autoantibody biomarkers. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

33749250923	Expression and distribution of HSP27 in response to G418 in different human breast cancer cell lines	Heat shock proteins (HSPs) play an important role in folding, intracellular localization and degradation of cellular proteins. However, the cellular role of HSP27 is not completely understood. The conflicting results have been reported regarding stress-induced nuclear translocation of HSP27. In this study, human breast cancer cells transiently and stably expressing HSP27-EGFP chimera were utilized to observe the intracellular localization of HSP27. The data show that the transient and stable expression of HSP27-EGFP displayed distinguishingly cellular localization. The nuclear translocalization of HSP27-EGFP was correlated with the presence of G418. Experiments carried out with different human breast cancer cell lines revealed clearly different distribution patterns of endogenous HSP27. The subcellular distribution of endogenous HSP27 appeared diffuse throughout the cytoplasm in MDA435 cells. In MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells, the accumulation of the protein was distinctly seen along the cell membrane and around nucleus. Moreover, the nuclear translocation of endogenous HSP27 was stimulated by G418 only in MDA435 cells, but not in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells. Overexpression of HSP27 has been associated with resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin. The correlation of the expression pattern of HSP27 with the drug resistance may need to be investigated. Further studies on the intracellular function of HSP27 may take into account its interaction proteins in the cells. It may provide useful information for the identification of sensitivity of carcinoma cells to the chemotherapeutic drugs and development of more specific agents to circumvent HSP27. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

33750968212	PIAS3 induction of PRB sumoylation represses PRB transactivation by destabilizing its retention in the nucleus	Progesterone receptor (PR) plays a critical role in cell proliferation and differentiation, and its transcriptional activity is known to be modulated by cofactor proteins. In the present study, we demonstrated that in the presence of progesterone, protein inhibitor of activated STAT-3 (PIAS3) significantly inhibited the PR transcriptional activity and the expression of progesterone-responsive genes. Reduction of endogenous PIAS3 by PIAS3 small-interfering RNA enhanced PR transactivation in a ligand-dependent manner. PIAS3 interacted with PR both in vitro and in vivo and the interaction was enhanced by progesterone. Furthermore, our findings suggested that PIAS3 strongly induced PRB sumoylation at three sites, Lys-7, Lys-388 and Lys-531. In addition, novel roles in PRB nuclear retention and transactivation were identified for these sites. Our data also suggested that PIAS3 was recruited in a largely hormone-dependent manner in response to a progesterone-responsive promoter. Finally, we demonstrated that PIAS3 inhibited the DNA-binding activity of PR and influenced its nuclear export as well as PR transactivation. Taken together, these data strongly suggested that PIAS3 played an important physiological role in PR function. © 2006 Oxford University Press.

33750971432	A novel neutralizing monoclonal antibody against both ricin toxin A and ricin toxin B, and application of a rapid sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay	Two strains of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) anti-ricin, both B chain and A chain, named 3D74 and 4C13, were generated efficiently. The two antibodies recognized different epitopes located in a separated toxin structure domain characterized by enzyme-linked immunosprbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. 3D74 recognized space conformation epitope, whereas 4C13 recognized linearity epitope of ricin. 4C13 possessed a novel neutralizing ability; the safe period for intraperitoneal injection of 100 μg of antibody was 30 min after intraperitoneal injection of 2 μg of ricin (10 times LD50). Using 3D74 and 4C13 as pair-matching antibodies, we established sandwich ELISA and rapid ELISA for detection of ricin. The detection sensitivities were 31.3 and 156 pg/ml, respectively. Rapid sandwich ELISA was sufficiently sensitive and was performed easily for ricin detection without any special instruments. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

33750993177	Analysis of an anti-B lymphocyte stimulator monoclonal antibody B7 and its binding activity to myeloma and lymphoma cell lines	Although there is convincing evidence of a link between B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and the proliferation and survival of malignant B cells, previous observations about BLyS expression on B lymphoma cells were contradictory. In this study, BLyS expression on human lymphoma and myeloma cell lines was evaluated by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter (FACS). First, specificity of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against BLyS, was analyzed. The results showed that MAb B7 was immunoglobulin 63 (IgGa) and recognized recombinant human BLyS specifically. In addition, MAb B7 bound to the histiocyte lymphoma cell line U937 in dosage-dependent manner, but not the T Iymphoma cell line Jurkat, suggesting that the cellular binding of MAb B7 was specific. Using this MAb, BLyS expression on two multiple myeloma cell lines (XG-7 and SKO-007) and two Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (Daudi and Raji) was evaluated. MAb B7 did bind to XG-7 and SKO-007 (66.84% and 79.38% positive cells, respectively). But MAb B7 did not bind Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, Daudi and Raji (4.09% and 3.02% positive cells, respectively). It will be interesting to further analyze the expression of BLyS on B malignant cells of multiple myeloma and lymphoma patients, and to evaluate the correlation of its expression and patient prognosis. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

33846680361	Extracorporeal ablation of uterine fibroids with high-intensity focused ultrasound: Imaging and histopathologic evaluation	Objective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in the treatment of uterine fibroids by using imaging and histopathologic examination. Methods. From May 2004 to June 2005, 119 consecutive patients with 187 uterine fibroids were treated with HIFU. Sixty-two fibroids received ultrasonographically guided needle puncture biopsy 1 week before and after HIFU treatment, respectively, to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the early therapeutic efficacy. Hematoxylin-epsin staining and electron microscopy were performed to characterize more subtle phenotypic changes to determine treatment success. Immediate therapeutic effects were assessed at follow-up with Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. All patients were followed for 6 to 12 months to observe long-term therapeutic effects. Fibroid mean diameters, volumes, and reduction rates 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after HIFU treatment were calculated and compared with 1-way analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Results. No severe complications were observed after HIFU ablation. Fifty-one (82.3%) of 62 biopsy specimens revealed obvious signs of necrosis under light microscopy, and more subtle changes in cellular structure that indicated nonviability could be found in 60 specimens (96.8%) under electron microscopy. However, viable cells still could be found in 16 specimens (25.8%). Follow-up images showed absence or reduction of blood supply in the lesions after HIFU ablation. Median reductions in tumor size as a percentage of initial tumor volume at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after HIFU treatment were 21.2%, 29.6%, 44.8%, and 48.7%, respectively. Conclusions. Imaging and histopathologic evidence directly validate HIFU ablation as an effective treatment of uterine fibroids. © 2007 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

33947141391	The modulating effect of proapoptotic protein Bax on the resistance of malignant lymphoma cells to tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand-induced apoptosis	Objective: To elucidate the modulating effect of proapoptotic protein Bax on the resistance of malignant lymphoma cells to tumor necrotic factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis and offer evidence for clinic work. Methods: Human malignant lymphoma cells of the line CRL and normal HRC cells were cultured and treated by 500μg/l. TRAIL(Group T), treated by 10 nmol/L PS-341 (Group P), or pre-treated by 10 nmol/L proteasome inhibitor PS-341 for 1 hour and then treated by 500 μg/L TRAIL(Group P + T). Flow cytometry was used to detect the cell apoptosis. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of Bax protein. Caspase-8 activity was tested by fluorophotometer. Immunoprecipitation method was used to examine the conformation change of Bax protein. Results: The apoptosis index 24 hours after treatment of the CRL cells of Group T was 21%, significantly lower than that of the HRC cells of Group T (32%, P < 0.01). The Bax protein expression amount 24 hours after treatment of the HRC cells of Group T was 1.8 times that of the normal cells, and the Bax protein expression amount 24 hours after treatment of the CRL cells of Group T was only 5/17 that of the normal amount. The apoptotic index 6 hours after treatment of the CRL cells of Group P + T was 54%, significantly higher than those of Groups T and P (both P < 0.01).

34247228197	CUE domain containing 2 regulates degradation of progesterone receptor by ubiquitin-proteasome	Accumulated evidence indicates that progesterone receptors (PR) are involved in proliferation of breast cancer cells and are implicated in the development of breast cancer. In this paper, a yeast two-hybrid screen for PR led to the identification of CUE domain containing 2 (CUEDC2), whose function is unknown. Our results demonstrate that CUEDC2 interacts with PR and promotes progesterone-induced PR degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The inhibition of endogenous CUEDC2 by siRNA nearly abrogated the progesterone-induced degradation of PR, suggesting that CUEDC2 is involved in progesterone-induced PR ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, we identify the sumoylation site Lys-388 of PR as the target of CUEDC2-promoted ubiquitination. CUEDC2 decreases the sumoylation while promoting ubiquitination on Lys-388 of PRB. We also show that CUEDC2 represses PR transactivation, inhibits the ability of PR to stimulate rapid MAPK activity, and impairs the effect of progesterone on breast cancer cell growth. Therefore, our results identify a key post-translational mechanism that controls PR protein levels and for the first time provide an important insight into the function of CUEDC2 in breast cancer proliferation. © 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.

34548272147	De novo design of ErbB2 epitope targeting fusion protein stabilized by coiled coil structure	The extracellular cysteine-rich domains of ErbB2 receptors play important roles in ligand binding and receptor dimerization. The aim of the present study was to design a novel peptide exerting cytostatic effect toward ErbB2-overexpessing tumors based on one of the cysteine-rich domain (S1) of ErbB2. In order to create a stable molecule with unique structural and binding property, a chimeric molecule PL45 composed of ErbB2 S1 domain targeting peptide and the five stranded coiled coil domain from cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) was generated. PL45 was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli and exhibited remarkable thermal and pH stability. It was capable of interfering with dimerization of ErbB2 and inhibiting the growth of ErbB2-overexpessing tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. The results provide evidence that the coiled coil structure can be used as a new scaffold to stabilize short peptides with potential application for anti-cancer immunotherapy and S1 domain of ErbB2 is a promising target for drug design. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

34548290968	Fra-1 and Stat3 synergistically regulate activation of human MMP-9 gene	Fra-1 is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors. Whether MMP-9 expression is regulated by Fra-1 has been contradictory. To clarify the capability of Fra-1 in activating transcription of MMP-9 gene, we analyzed the transcriptional activity of the MMP-9 promoter through the measure of luciferase activities in the MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with Fra-1. The positive regulation of Fra-1 on MMP-9 promoter was not detectable. By the analysis of MMP-9 promoter, a potential Stat3 binding site, just juxtaposed AP-1 consensus sequence, was noticed. The reporter assay showed that MMP-9 promoter was activated remarkably by cotransfection with Fra-1 and Stat3C. DNA affinity precipitation assay confirmed the binding of Stat3 and Fra-1 to the elements of MMP-9 promoter and also revealed c-Jun recruited to Stat3-Fra-1 complex. By immunoprecipitation assay, the Stat3/Fra-1, Stat3/c-Jun and Fra-1/c-Jun complexes were identified in vivo. Our study demonstrated that the activation of MMP-9 promoter is dependent upon interactions of Fra-1/c-Jun with Stat3. A juxtaposed Stat3/AP-1 element plays a crucial role in the manner of enhancersome in the activation of MMP-9 gene. The functional cooperation of the Stat3 and AP-1 transcription factors is required for the transcription of MMP-9 gene. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34548328239	A5, a new small-molecule inhibitor of CD4 D1 obtained from a computer-aided screening method, contributes to the inhibition of CD4+ T-cell function	In this study, the authors apply a computer-based strategy to screen thousands of small-molecule, nonpeptidic organic compounds in the Available Chemicals Directory database and to select a series of potential candidates as ligands of the proposed CD4 D1 surface pocket. Then, several cell-based models are used to determine the actual biological functions of these compounds. A small molecule designated A5 (N-((pyridine-4-yl)methylene)thiophene-2- carbohydrazide) was obtained by a virtual screening followed by 3 cell-based functional assays. The results show that A5 could specifically block the CD4-major histocompatibility complex II binding in a rosetting assay, inhibit the mixed lymphocyte reaction-induced T-cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, and reduce the PMA plus ionomycin-stimulated interleukin-2 secretion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. © 2007 Society for Biomolecular Sciences.

34548453719	Critical role of c-Jun overexpression in liver metastasis of human breast cancer xenograft model	Background: c-Jun/AP-1 has been linked to invasive properties of aggressive breast cancer. Recently, it has been reported that overexpression of c-Jun in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 resulted in increased AP-1 activity, motility and invasiveness of the cells in vitro and tumor formation in nude mice. However, the role of c-Jun in metastasis of human breast cancer in vivo is currently unknown. Methods: To further investigate the direct involvement of c-Jun in tumorigenesis and metastasis, in the present study, the effects of c-Jun overexpression were studied in both in vitro and in nude mice. Results: Ectopic overexpression of c-Jun promoted the growth of MCF-7 cells and resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of cells in S phase and increased motility and invasiveness. Introduction of c-Jun gene alone into weakly invasive MCF-7 cells resulted in the transfected cells capable of metastasizing to the nude mouse liver following tail vein injection. Conclusion: The present study confirms that overexpression of c-Jun contributes to a more invasive phenotype in MCF-7 cells. It indicates an interesting relationship between c-Jun expression and increased property of adhesion, migration and in vivo liver metastasis of MCF-7/c-Jun cells. The results provide further evidence that c-Jun is involved in the metastasis of breast cancer. The finding also opens an opportunity for development of anti-c-Jun strategies in breast cancer therapy. © 2007 Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Methods: Fusion pr otein HFI was constructed. The efficacy of HFI in mediating tumor cell lysis was determined by colorimetric lactate dehydrogenase release assays. The antitumor activity of HFI was evaluated in tumor xenograft models. Results: The fusion protein was folded as a homodimer formed by covalently linking Fc portions and it retained ErbB2 specificity and IL-2 biological activity. HFI mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) at low effector-to-target ratios in vitro and improved the therapeutic efficacy of IL-2 in experiments in vivo. Conclusion: The genetically-engineered anti-ErbB2 scFv-Fc-IL-2 fusion protein exhibited high efficiency both in mediating ADCC in vitro and significant antitumor activity in tumor xenograft models. © 2007 CPS and SIMM.

36448940874	Mutational analysis of ErbB2 intracellular localization	In the present study, the sub-cellular localization of ErbB2 and its mutants expressed as GFP-tagged proteins in MCF-7 cells or endogenous ErbB2 in SKBR3 cells was examined. The data presented here demonstrate that the full-length ErbB2 was localized at the cytoplasmic membrane and ErbB2 ICD localized in the nucleus predominantly. The sequence of ErbB2 ICD contains the information supporting its nuclear translocation and cytoplasmic retention. A region (residues 721-970) harboring an arginine triplet is essential for the cytoplasmic trafficking of ErbB2. The results indicate that differential sub-cellular localization of ErbB2 ICD and the full-length ErbB2 is dependent on their structural determinants. The present results give initial clues for further analysis of the mechanism of ErbB2 intracellular localization. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

In this work, we further used a murine model of corneal allograft rejection to determine its in vivo immunosuppressive activities. To mimic the situation in high-risk human eyes, the recipient mice corneas were all induced by intrastromal sutures to serve as neovascularized graft beds. J2 was administrated by mouth 3 h before transplantation and thereafter on consecutive 12 days. The results showed that J2 could significantly prolong the median survival time of the corneal allografts, compared to the untreated control group. And the subsequent functional assays, including T cell phenotype analysis, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays revealed that the immunosuppressive activity of J2 was associated with its inhibitory effects on the CD4

36949001566	Mechanisms underlying B-cell tolerance induction by antigen-immunoglobulin G gene transfer	Previous studies on the mechanisms underlying tolerance induction in diabetes have mainly focused on T cells, however B cells also have an important role in diabetes. Based on our previous studies that splenocytes, transduced with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 fused to immunoglobulin (Ig) G carrier, reduced antibody-mediated response in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, here we examined the mechanisms underlying B-cell tolerance in this system. We found that GAD-IgG-transduced splenocytes did not reduce CD40 expression on B cells in NOD mice, but they did downregulate CD40 ligand (CD40L) expression. Furthermore, anti-CD40L injection reduced autoantibody levels in NOD mice and in vitro experiments demonstrated that CD40L blockade reduced the antigen-presenting capability of B-cells. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that downregulation of CD40L may be one mechanism underlying the induction of B-cell tolerance in GAD-IgG-treated NOD mice.

37349014046	Analysis of apoptosis and cell proliferation after high intensity-focused ultrasound ablation combined with microbubbles in rabbit livers	OBJECTIVE: To analyze apoptosis and expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) sequentially in the rabbit liver tissue after high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation combined with microbubbles. METHODS: Fifty rabbits were divided into two groups randomly. Rabbits in group I received injections with ultrasound contrast agent Sonovue, before HIFU ablation, on their livers and those in group II were ablated by a single HIFU exposure without microbubbles. Rabbits were killed on days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14 after HIFU ablation. The livers were excised for light microscopic examination with hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining for PCNA expression and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining for apoptosis. RESULTS: A fibra tissue band composed of fibrocytes and capillary vessels, which was detected by light microscope in the rim of the targeted area after 3 days in group I, was wider than that in group II. The apoptosis index (the number of apoptotic events divided by the total cell number in the same field) and PCNA-positive index (the number of PCNA-positive cells divided by the total cell number in the same field) in group I on days 0, 1, 3, 7 and14 after HIFU ablation were higher than those in group II. CONCLUSION: Microbubbles can improve the apoptosis and cell proliferation in zones surrounding coagulated necrosis areas after HIFU ablation, which may be explored to benefit enhanced HIFU treatment. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

38449089726	c-Jun, a crucial molecule in metastasis of breast cancer and potential target for biotherapy	Human breast cancer cell line SKBR3 expresses high level of the ErbB2 molecule, which has been associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer. Elevated ErbB2 functions as a transactivating co-receptor and promotes the formation of ErbB2 containing heterodimers, which are more mitogenic and transforming, and have a higher ligand affinity and signaling potency by virtue of the potent latent kinase activity of ErbB2. Interestingly, SKBR3 cells are non-tumorigenic in nude mice. By ectopic overexpression of c-Jun in SKBR3 cells, involvement of c-Jun in invasiveness and metastasis in vivo was investigated in this study. The critical role of c-Jun in the tumorigenesis and metastasis is demonstrated in nude mice.

84876728628	Ultrasound-guided percutaneous laser and ethanol ablation of rabbit VX2 liver tumors	Background: Only a small percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may benefit out of surgical resection. Thus, lots of these patients are in need of local control, such as percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), percutaneous laser ablation (PLA), or radiofrequency thermal ablation (RF). Purpose: To investigate the effects of ultrasound-guided PLA combined with PEI on rabbit VX2 liver tumors, using conventional gray-scale ultrasonography (US), color/power Doppler (CD/PD)US, contrast-enhanced (CE) US, and histologic examination. Material and Methods: VX2 tumors were implanted in the livers of 80 rabbits. Fourteen days after implantation, animals were randomly separated into four groups of 20 rabbits. Treatment of the four groups was with: (i) PLA; (ii) PEI; (iii) combined therapy of PLA immediately followed by PEI; and (iv) combined therapy of PEI immediately followed by PLA. Conventional gray-scale US, CD US, PD US, and CE US were performed before and after ablation. The effects on ablated areas were assessed by histologic examination. Results: Conventional gray-scale US showed a clear boundary around the ablated area in groups 1, 3, and 4. An isoechoic treated region with an irregular boundary was seen in group 2. On CE US, coagulated areas demonstrated a perfusion defect. Both conventional gray-scale US and CE US showed that the ablated volume in group 4 was larger than that in groups 1, 2, and 3. CD US and PD US demonstrated residual tumor in the periphery of ablated areas in groups 1 and 2, but not in groups 3 and 4. CE US demonstrated no residual tumor in group 4, unlike in groups 1, 2, and 3. Examination of treated tumors demonstrated necrosis in the ablated zones and increasing surrounding fibrous bands in the four treatment groups. Residual viable tissue in group 4 was less than that in groups 1, 2, and 3. Conclusion: Combined therapy of PEI immediately followed by PLA can coagulate significantly larger volumes of tumor and reduce residual tumor.

43049183421	HER2-dependent MMP-7 expression is mediated by activated STAT3	MMP-7 expression is highly regulated at the level of transcription. An understanding of how the MMP-7 gene is regulated is critical to elucidate the mechanisms of MMP-7 overexpression in the early tumor development. In the present study, increased mRNA and protein expressions of MMP-7 were observed in MCF-7 cells stably overexpressing HER2 (MCF-7/HER2). The promoter activity of MMP-7 gene was upregulated in MCF-7/HER2 cells and significantly enhanced by HRG induction. Examination of the MMP-7 promoter sequence revealed three potential STAT3 binding sites within the proximal region. MMP-7 promoter activity was remarkably induced in MCF-7 cells expressing the constitutively activated STAT3 (MCF-7/STAT3C). RT-PCR and Western blot analysis confirmed the expression upregulation of mRNA and protein of MMP-7 in the MCF-7/STAT3C cells. Binding of STAT3 to MMP-7 promoter was verified by ChIP and the critical STAT3 element within the MMP-7 promoter identified by the mutagenesis of the core STAT3 recognition sequence. Increased STAT3 phosphorylation was observed in either HER2 overexpressing cells or HRG-induced cells. The data indicate that HRG-induced HER2-dependent transcriptional upregulation and protein secretion of MMP-7 are mediated by activated STAT3. The expression of MMP-7 may be attributed to HER2/STAT3 activation. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

47049106621	Characterization of a novel anti-DR5 monoclonal antibody WD1 with the potential to induce tumor cell apoptosis	TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a TNF family member capable of inducing apoptosis. Death receptor 5 (DR 5) is a key receptor of TRAIL and plays an important role in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. To prepare monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against DR5, cDNA encoding soluble DR5 (sDR5) was firstly amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with specific primers, and then inserted into a prokaryotic expression vector pET-30a. The recombinant plasmid was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3), and sDR5 was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. As an antigen, sDR5 was used to immunize mice. Hybridomas secreting antibodies against sDR5 were identified. One positive clone was selected to produce antibody, WD1. ELISA and immunofluorescence demonstrated that WD1 could bind recombinant sDR5 and membranebound DR5 (mDR5) on Jurkat and Molt-4 cells. ATPLite assays showed that Jurkat and Molt-4 cells were sensitive to the antibody in a dose dependent manner. The Annexin V/PI assays and Giemsa's staining both showed that WD1 could induce Jurkat cell apoptosis efficiently. Transient transfection of 293T cells and indirect immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that mAb (WD1) couldn't cross-react with DR4. Our findings indicated that the novel antibody, WD1 could act as a direct agonist, bind DR5 characteristically, and initiate efficient apoptotic signaling and tumor regression. Thus, WD1 would be a leading candidate for potential cancer therapeutics. © 2008 by The Chinese Society of Immunology.

46249105559	Hemostasis of active bleeding from the liver with percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy under contrast-enhanced ultrasonographic guidance: An experimental study	Objective. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT) guided by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) for controlling active bleeding in rabbit livers. Methods. Twenty actively bleeding rabbit liver models, produced with an 18-gauge semiautomatic biopsy needle and confirmed with CEUS, were randomly divided into 2 groups: a PMCT group (n = 10, with a microwave antenna placed into the bleeding site under ultrasonographic guidance and worked at 60 W for 30 seconds on average) and a control group (n = 10, with the active bleeding site not treated). After therapy procedures were performed, lactated Ringer's solution resuscitation was then performed in both groups to maintain the mean arterial pressure at 70 mm Hg for 1 hour. The intraperitoneal blood loss, total resuscitation volume, mean arterial pressure, and hematocrit value were recorded. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations were performed at the end of the study. Results. After PMCT, the former bleeding site appeared on CEUS as a round or an oval area devoid of contrast. The PMCT group had lower blood loss (30.4 ± 7.2 versus 101.6 ± 18.2 mL; P < .05) and a lower total resuscitation volume (56.5 ± 10 versus 186 ± 36.6 mL; P < .05) than the control group. The mean hematocrit value in the PMCT group was significantly higher than that in the control group (26% ± 4% versus 19% ± 4%; P < .05) at the end of the experiment. Conclusions. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonographically guided PMCT significantly decreased blood loss in a rabbit model of active liver bleeding. It provides a simple and quick method to control blood loss in liver injuries with active bleeding. © 2008 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

47249133823	Three- and 4-dimensional ultrasonography in the prenatal evaluation of fetal anomalies associated with trisomy 18	Objective. The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of 3- and 4-dimensional ultrasonography (3D/4DUS) for the description of anomalies associated with trisomy 18 and to determine whether 3D/4DUS adds diagnostic information over what is provided by conventional 2-dimensional ultrasonography (2DUS) alone. Methods. Twenty-six fetuses subsequently proven to have trisomy 18 underwent prenatal ultrasonographic evaluations by both 2DUS and 3D/4DUS. Volume data sets were acquired by the same sonographers after the conventional 2DUS examinations and were explored with 4-dimensional imaging software by another independent examiner blinded to the indications of 2DUS. The findings detected by 2DUS and 3D/4DUS were compared with those acquired at autopsy. The sensitivity of each modality for detecting anomalies was calculated and compared by the McNemar test. Results. Excluding polyhydramnios, there were 131 anomalies confirmed postnatally in 26 fetuses with trisomy 18. There was a statistically significant difference in the sensitivity for detecting anomalies between 3D/4DUS and 2DUS (93.89% versus 73.28%; McNemar value = 23.31; P < .05), especially in anomalies of the face/neck (96.15% versus 65.38%; McNemar value = 6.13; P< .05) and extremities (96.3% versus 48.15%; McNemar value = 11.07; P < .05). Three- and 4-dimensional ultrasonography provided additional diagnostic information for 83.97% of the anomalies related to trisomy 18 and influenced the obstetric management of 4 fetuses. Conclusions. Three- and 4-dimensional ultrasonography offered diagnostic advantages for many anomalies associated with trisomy 18, especially for anomalies of the extremities and face. This modality could be a powerful adjunct to 2DUS in the prenatal anatomic evaluation of fetuses with trisomy 18. © 2008 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

48749130440	A new strategy to induce effective antitumour response in vitro and in vivo	To induce Her2-specific cell immune response, we used xenogeneic antigen rat neu L2-S2 domains as the vaccine antigen. The antigenic protein was engineered as a chimeric protein with human IgG1 Fc region (neu-Fc). Neu-Fc could stimulate the cell proliferation in mixed lymphocyte reaction effectively. Simultaneous neu-Fc and IFN-γ stimulation dramatically elevated IL-12 secretion and reduced IL-10 production in PBMC. To further augment the activating effects on Th1-type response, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was utilized as a non-specific stimulus. Neu-Fc, IFN-γ and BCG costimulation exhibited the most conspicuous effects on the reversal of the Th1-type inhibitory effects by MCF-7 cell supernatant compared with neu-Fc alone or IFN-γ and BCG costimulation. The lytic activity of effector cells to Her2 overexpressing cells was greatly promoted by neu-Fc, IFN-γ and BCG stimulation simultaneously. Neu-Fc led to considerable retardation in EMT6/Her2 tumour growth in Balb/c mice. IFN-γ and BCG efficiently enhanced the antitumour activity. A large amount of inflammatory cells were found to be accumulated in the tumour tissues or surrounded tumours in mice treated with neu-Fc, IFN-γ and BCG but no inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in control tumours, indicating that the strategy is potent enough to support the initiation and propagation of tumour-specific immune response in an established tumour and generate a proinflammatory environment. © 2008 The Authors.

51649085740	Ablation of high intensity focused ultrasound combined with SonoVue on rabbit VX2 liver tumors: Assessment with conventional gray-scale US, conventional color/power doppler US, contrast-enhanced color doppler US, and contrast-enhanced pulse-inversion harmonic US	Background: We investigated effects of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) combined with contrast agent SonoVue on rabbit VX2 liver tumors by using conventional gray-scale ultrasonography (US), color/power Doppler (CD/PD) US, contrast-enhanced color Doppler (CE CD) US, and contrast-enhanced pulse-inversion harmonic (CE PIH) US. Methods: Fourteen days after implantation of VX2 tumors in livers of 50 rabbits, animals were randomly separated into two groups. Based on principles of HIFU, the volume of the tumor was divided into several parallel "planes" to be ablated. Before ablation on each "plane," 0.2 mL SonoVue was injected in bolus via ear veins of rabbits in group II and normal saline solution was administrated in group I. Conventional gray-scale US, CD US, PD US, CE CD US, and CE PIH US were performed before and after ablation. Results: Twenty-three surviving rabbits in each group underwent HIFU ablation. Conventional gray-scale US showed ablated areas diffusely hyperechoic. On CE PIH US, coagulated areas presented perfusion defect. Both conventional gray-scale US and CE PIH US showed the ablated volume in group II was larger than that in group I. CD US and PD US demonstrated residual vessels in periphery ablated areas in group I, but no residual vessels in group II. CE CD US and CE PIH US depicted less residual vessels in periphery ablated areas in group II than that in group I. Conclusion: By enlarging ablated volume of tissue and reducing residual vessels, effects of HIFU ablation on rabbit VX2 liver tumors were enhanced by contrast agent SonoVue. © 2008 Society of Surgical Oncology.

51049084055	The characteristic of an anti-human DR5 antibody A6	The efficacy of many cancer treatments is due to their ability to induce apoptosis. DR5 can activate apoptosis pathway after binding with its natural ligand, tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L). Both TRAIL and agonistic anti-DR5 monoclonal antibody are currently being explored for cancer therapy. The mechanisms of cytotoxicity of our previously prepared monoclonal antibody A6 against DR5 were investigated here. A6 could cause viability loss of Jurkat cells in both time- and dose-dependent manner which could be attributed to the activation of apoptosis pathway. Caspases 3, 8 and 9 were activated in Jurkat cells and the caspase specific inhibitors, such as broad caspases inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, caspase 8 specific inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK and caspase 9 specific inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK could recover the viability loss caused by A6. The function and molecular mechanism of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis were also investigated and compared with those of A6. Although A6 and TRAIL recognize a different epitope, they could induce a similar reaction in Jurkat cells. Copyright © 2008 by The Chinese Society of Immunology.

52149091686	Cyclic AMP inhibits JNK activation by CREB-mediated induction of c-FLIP	The cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway has been reported to either promote or suppress apoptosis, in a cell context-dependent manner. Our previous study has shown that cAMP, by protein kinase A (PKA)-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-dynein light chain (DLC) pathway, negatively regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 activation, thereby contributing to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced apoptosis in certain types of cells. However, it remains largely unknown how cAMP suppresses apoptosis. Here we report that cAMP antagonized UV-induced apoptosis in Rat-1 and NIH 3T3 cells. Despite that cAMP significantly suppressed UV-induced p38 activation, inhibition of p38 activity showed no significant effect on UV-induced cell death in both cell lines. Further studies revealed that cAMP antagonized UV-induced apoptosis by inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activation.

54949088624	Heregulin-β promotes matrix metalloproteinase-7 expression via HER2-mediated AP-1 activation in MCF-7 cells	It has been reported that HER2 level is strongly correlated with the expression of MMP-7 in some carcinomas. HER2 is a preferred heterodimerization partner of EGFR, HER3, and HER4. HER2 overexpression is believed to enhance the signaling from these receptors in response to binding of their specific ligands. In this study, we show that heregulin-β (HRG-β) stimulation remarkably induced MMP-7 promoter activity and significantly enhanced the expression and activity of MMP-7 in MCF-7 cells overexpressing HER2. The expression of c-Jun and c-Fos and the level of the phosphorylated c-Jun were markedly increased after HRG-β treatment in MCF-7/HER2 cells. Increased MMP-7 promoter activity was observed in MCF-7/c-Jun cells. The activity of the MMP-7 promoter induced by HRG-β in MCF-7/HER2 cells could be inhibited by a dominant negative c-Jun mutant TAM67 and by the mutagenesis of the AP-1 site. c-Jun binding to MMP-7 promoter was confirmed by ChIP assays. The data indicate a close link among HRG-β stimulation, HER signaling, and AP-1 activation. Our data suggest that HRG-β-induced MMP-7 expression was regulated by HER2-mediated AP-1 activation in MCF-7 cells. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2008.

5444221869	Retroviral delivery of GAD-IgG fusion construct induces tolerance and modulates diabetes: A role for CD4+ regulatory T cells and TGF-β?	Previous studies have demonstrated that antigen-specific tolerance could be induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated B cells retrovirally transduced with an immunoglobulin-antigen (or epitope-containing peptide) fusion construct. To investigate the mechanism of this gene therapy system, we now adapted this approach to immunotherapy of spontaneous diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease triggered, in part, by a pathogenic response to glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 65. We demonstrate that LPS-stimulated splenocytes, retrovirally transfected with GAD-IgG fusion construct, induce a significant antigen-specific hyporesponsiveness at both cellular and humoral levels and reduce the incidence of diabetes in female NOD mice. Parallel with disease protection, we observed a prolonged increase of the numbers of CD4

56449124449	In vitro and in vivo antitumor effect of a trivalent bispecific antibody targeting ErbB2 and CD16	In order to optimize the structure of bispecific antibody (BsAb) and minimize its toxicity, we developed a trivalent anti-ErbB2/anti-CD16 BsAb. This BsAb possesses three antigen binding sites, two antigen binding sites in the form of scFvs targeting the tumor cells overexpressing ErbB2 and a monovalent Fab fragment redirecting NK cells. Critical for this BsAb is its capacity to trigger cytotoxicity of the effector cells in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we demonstrated that the BsAb is capable of binding to ErbB2 extracellular domain on SKBR3 cells and effectively direct the cytotoxic activities of effector cells to SKBR3 cells even at a low concentration. The BsAb was more effective to SKBR3 cells than to MCF-7 cells, indicating that the killing of tumor cells was dependent on the density of ErbB2 molecules on cell surface. Furthermore, the BsAb was more potent than anti-ErbB2 single chain antibody (scFv)-Fc fusion proteins in the cytotoxicity assay and in SKOV3 xenograft animals. Improved efficacy demonstrates that the BsAb may be valuable to be further modified and optimized for the treatment of malignant cells in a minimal residual disease. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

6044263660	Proteomic analysis of human acute leukemia cells: Insight into their classification	Purpose: French-American-British (FAB) classification of acute leukemia with genetic heterogeneity is important for treatment and prognosis. However, the distinct protein profiles that contribute to the subtypes and facilitate molecular definition of acute leukemia classification are still unclear. Experimental Design: The proteins of leukemic cells from 61 cases of acute leukemia characterized by FAB classification were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and the differentially expressed protein spots were identified by both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and tandem electrospray ionization MS (ESI-MS/MS). Results: The distinct protein profiles of acute leukemia FAB types or subtypes were successfully explored, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), its subtypes (M2, M3, and MS) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), which were homogeneous within substantial samples of the respective subgroups but clearly differed from all other subgroups. We found a group of proteins that were highly expressed in M2 and M3, rather than other subtypes. Among them, myeloid-related proteins 8 and 14 were first reported to mark AML differentiation and to differentiate AML from ALL. Heat shock 27 kDa protein 1 and other proteins that are highly expressed in ALL may play important roles in clinically distinguishing AML from ALL. Another set of proteins up-regulated was restricted to granulocytic lineage leukemia. High-level expression of NM23-H1 was found in all but the M3a subtype, with favorable prognosis. Conclusions: These data have implications in delineating the pathways of aberrant gene expression underlying the pathogenesis of acute leukemia and could facilitate molecular definition of FAB classification. The extension of the present analysis to currently less well-defined acute leukemias will identify additional subgroups.

The experiment results show that the intermittent working process is an effective means to enhance the underground heat energy storage efficiency, the synergetic control of the intermission frequency and the underground transient heat-transfer load is beneficial to bring the comprehensive efficiency into full play. A continuous high load heat storage with sharp rise of the soil temperature around the heat source leads to an obvious fall of the temperature difference between the heat source and the adjacent soil, resulting in the adjacent heat accumulation and the heat-transfer choke. Besides, a concept of ideal temperature domain of underground energy storage was presented as an important index to evaluate the effect of energy storage.

61849088455	p38 MAPK contributes to CD54 expression and the enhancement of phagocytic activity during macrophage development	p38 is a subfamily of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily with four isoforms. It has been well established that p38 plays a central role in the production of inflammatory molecules and is therefore required for the activation of macrophages in response to inflammatory stimuli. However, little is known about the roles of p38 in macrophage development. The difficulty to get mice deficient in multiple p38 isoforms complicates the study of p38 in macrophage development. With the model of bone marrow-derived murine macrophages and highly selective p38α/β inhibitors SB203580 and SB239063, here we report that macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) induces p38 activation during macrophage development. Inhibition of p38 activity showed minor effects on macrophage proliferation or survival, and did not block CD14, F4/80 expression. However, p38 inhibitors resulted in a significant reduction in CD54 expression and impaired phagocytic activity. Taken together, our data suggest that p38 contributes to macrophage development. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

62649134663	Induction of SOX4 by DNA damage is critical for p53 stabilization and function	DNA damage response (DDR) acts as a tumorigenesis barrier, and any defects in the DDR machinery may lead to cancer. SOX4 expression is elevated in many types of tumors; however, its role in DDR is still largely unknown. Here, we show that SOX4, a new DNA damage sensor, is required for the activation of p53 tumor suppressor in response to DNA damage. Notably, SOX4 interacts with and stabilizes p53 protein by blocking Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, SOX4 enhances p53 acetylation by interacting with p300/CBP and facilitating p300/CBP/p53 complex formation. In concert with these results, SOX4 promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and it inhibits tumorigenesis in a p53-dependent manner. Therefore, these findings highlight SOX4 as a potential key factor in regulating DDR-associated cancer.

64449088311	Review of development from GSHP to UTES in China and other countries	Energy storage technologies (EST) facilitate the efficient utilization of renewable energy sources and energy conservation, and they are expected to be more prevalent in the future. There is a great potential to substitute the use of EST for burning of fossil fuels by using stored heat that would otherwise be wasted and using renewable generation resources. These energy sources can be used more effectively through the addition of short- or long-term energy storage, even to the seasonal thermal energy storage. Underground thermal energy storage (UTES) is one form of EST, and perhaps the most frequently used storage technology in North America and Europe. Gradually it is growing as the application of ground source heat pump (GSHP) with UTES in China. But UTES systems involve complicated unsteady processes that include energy rejection, accumulation, preservation and extraction. This paper reviewed the progress of UTES companioning with GSHP worldwide, and surveyed the development of GSHP and the origination of UTES, especially as to soil/rock UTES. Meanwhile, the basic proposal for development in the future to supply a gap in the field of UTES in China was presented. A coming work should aim to more researching basic problems during the demonstration application, such as investigation of mechanisms, characteristics and performance of the unsteady and transient heat transfer in a complex underground environment, and control strategies of the UTES system. These problems will strengthen theoretical and practical understanding and facilitate more extensive application of UTES in China. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Four typical operational modes on the load of heat resources (boreholes of underground heat exchanger), such as equivalent mode, concentrative mode, intermittent mode and heat shield mode were studied experimentally. Thus, a new method of the higher conservation efficiency of UTES has been pursued by means of controlling every load of boreholes to enhance the practical maneuverability in UTES. The reformation of temperature distribution has been ideated and presented, and the behavior of heat shield has been found to realize a higher efficiency and establish an optimization way for UTES.

Materials and Methods: Forty rabbits with VX2 liver tumors were subjected to HIFU ablation. Before ablation, a bolus injection of 0.2 mL SonoVue was administrated in group II (n = 20), and normal saline solution was injected in group I (n = 20). On day 0, 3, 7, and 14 after ablation, 5 animals in each group were sacrificed. The tissue in ablated zone, transient zone (within 3 mm around ablated area), and surrounding zone (beyond 3 mm around ablated area) were collected. Coagulated volume measurement, hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry of Ki 67, Bcl-2, CD54, and MMP-2 to determine cell proliferation and tissue repair, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) and succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) staining to evaluate tissue viability were performed. Results: The coagulated volume in group II at each time point was larger than that in group I (P < .05). After day 3, hematoxylin-eosin staining demonstrated necrosis in ablated zones and increasing surrounding fibra bands in group I and group II, while increasing expression of Ki 67, Bcl-2, CD54, and MMP-2 in transient zones was detected using immunohistochemistry in both groups (P > .05). NADPH-d and SDH staining showed dramatic decrease of enzyme activities in ablated zones immediately after ablation, while residual viable tissues in ablated zones of group II were less than those of group I (P < .05).

To study the function of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) through protein/protein interaction, a mouse embryo cDNA library was screened by the yeast two-hybrid system. A clone was found to interact specifically with FMRP. The cDNA of this clone (Genbank accession number af102875) encoded a protein highly homologous to human G/T mismatch-specific DNA thymine glycosylase (hTDG). Interactions between various alternatively spliced FMRP isoforms and a series of mTDG deletion proteins were further studied in the yeast two-hybrid system and their interaction amino acid regions were determined. Interaction between FMRP and TDG existed inside exon 13 of FMRP (amino acid residue 397-425) and around amino acid residue 122-346 of TDG. These results will be helpful to the study of the biological role of FMRP.

74449091309	Experiment and simulation of temperature characteristics of intermittently-controlled ground heat exchanges	Because of poor heat transfer coefficients of soil/rock, ground source heat pumps (GSHP) or underground thermal energy storage (UTES) systems always occupy a large area and need many ground heat exchangers. This initial energy investment is so heavy that it cannot be used on a large-scale. Intermittent operation can reduce the extreme temperatures around the ground heat exchangers (GHEs) and keep the temperature in reasonable range. The aim of this study is to implement an experiment and develop a dynamic model of hydronic heating systems of GSHP in order to get a more fair comparison of energy efficiency between continuously controlled and intermittently controlled systems. Factors such as thermal inertia, temperature levels and lag time are also considered to see how they affect the efficiency. It is shown that temperature variation is related to the intermittent period and that intermittence prolongs the heat transfer without reaching at an utmost temperature (operation limitation). An effectively controlled intermittent process can optimize the capacity of heat exchange units so as to achieve better application of the ground energy. Additionally, the intermittent control can decrease the number of GHEs of GSHP and UTES systems and keep better working conditions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The mini-yCD3 is a novel non-mitogenic anti-CD3 antibody based on a murine anti-human CD3 antibody yCD3. However, the mechanism by which mini-yCD3 suppresses immune responses mediated by activated T-cells remains unknown. To elucidate its mechanism, we examined the effects of the mini-yCD3 on early signaling events in T-cells. Similar to the mitogenic anti-CD3 mAb, mini-yCD3 triggered changes in the T-cell receptor (TCR). However, unlike the mitogenic anti-CD3 stimulation, mini-yCD3 was ineffective at inducing the highly phosphorylated ζ chain and tyrosine phosphorylation of the associated tyrosine kinase ZAP-70.

7644239849	A novel hIL-6 antagonist peptide from computer-aided design contributes to suppression of apoptosis in M1 cells	Based on the complex crystal structure of human interleukin-6 (hIL-6) and its receptor (hIL-6R), a novel hIL-6 antagonist peptide (named PT) was designed using computer-guided design method. Dealing with molecular docking and molecular dynamics methods, the interaction between PT and hIL-6R was analyzed. The theoretical studies showed that PT possessed very high affinity to hIL-6R and offered a practical means of imposing long-term blockade of hIL-6 activity in vivo. This effect was examined due to growth arrest and apoptosis induced by hIL-6 in myeloblastic cell line M1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The findings demonstrate that PT could also act as an excellent antagonist candidate for the induction of growth arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, murine M1 myeloid cell line, which was induced by the physiological inducer hIL-6 to undergo apoptosis and growth arrest, could be used as a subtle model system to test hIL-6 antagonist. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

75349106763	Preparation of the monoclonal antibody against SOX4 protein and detection of SOX4 expression level in different tumor cell lines	In the present study, we constructed a prokaryotic expression vector containing SOX4 protein encoding sequences. The GST-SOX4 soluble protein was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α and purified by glutathione sepharose-4B. The purified recombinant protein was used to immunize Balb/C mice and the monoclonal antibody against SOX4 was prepared by using hybridoma technique. The titer of the antibody was determined as 1×10-5 by indirect ELISA. The specificity of the antibody was verified by Western blotting analysis. The monoclonal antibody specifically recognized the overexpressed exogenous SOX4 protein as well as endogenous SOX4 protein. The expression level of SOX4 protein in different cell lines and mouse tissues was detected by using the antibody. Differential expression of the protein was demonstrated by Western blotting. The data indicated that the antibody was specific. The antibody can be used as an important tool for further exploration of the role of SOX4 in tumorigenesis. © 2009 Institute of Microbiology, CAS & CSM, All rights reserved.

75349114130	Seasonal running performance in hydronic ice-snow melting on road by using the earth energy	The seasonally running performance of the hydronic ice-snow melting (HISM) on the road by using the ground source heat pump (GSHP) for many seasons was investigated. A innovate numerical simulation module of all HISM systen were established. Results show that the HISM in both heavy and frequent snowfall leads to the further drop of underground temperature and the more power consumption. The maximal instantaneous rate of the heat extracted from the ground appears in begin of every ice-snow melting, and this rate gradually decreases and fluctuates. The seasonal running for many years results in a gradual drop of the ground equilibrium temperature and COP (coefficient of performance) of heat pump system year after year. In the computational example, the COP decreases 8.5% after 5 years. Therefore, the combination of slab solar collection (SSC) and underground thermal energy storage (UTES), which actually supplements the thermal energy to the ground and increases the underground temperature, will provide a sustainable development for the HISM.

77949875577	Leptin upregulates telomerase activity and transcription of human telomerase reverse transcriptase in MCF-7 breast cancer cells	The aim was to analyze the mechanism of leptin-induced activity of telomerase in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We found that leptin activated telomerase in a dose-dependent manner; leptin upregulated the expression of Human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT) at mRNA and protein levels; blockade of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation significantly counteracted leptin-induced hTERT transcription and protein expression; chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that leptin enhanced the binding of STAT3 to the hTERT promoter. This study uncovers a new mechanism of the proliferative effect of leptin on breast cancer cells and provides a new explanation of obesity-related breast cancer. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77951617421	Synergistic effects of proteasome inhibitor on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in malignant lymphoma cells	Objective: To explore the synergistic mechanisms of proteasome inhibitor on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in malignant lymphoma cells and to offer new ideas for clinical treatment of drug-resistant tumors. Methods: The apoptosis index, Caspase-3 activity and Bax protein level were detected in malignant lymphoma CRL cells using flow cytometry, Western blot and fluorometry. The CRL cells were treated with PS - 341, with or without TRAIL. Results: The CRL cells were resistant to the TRAlL-induced apoptosis and the apoptosis rate of TRAlL-treated cells at 24h was only 21.3% of the level found in untreated CRL cells. Bax protein was degraded during the PS-341 treatment and the Bax expression level at 6h was 5/9 of the level found in untreated cells. The apoptosis index increased significantly when the working concentration reached 10nmol/L PS-341. At that concentration, the apoptosis index at 24h was 50.4%, and the expression of Bax protein was 1.2 times the level found in untreated cells. The Caspase-3 enzyme activity was increased to 122.56±1.434μmol/L ·h-1 ·mg-1 protein. Conclusions: Reasonable use of the proteasome inhibitor PS-341 can effectively inhibit the degradation of the apoptotic protein Bax and reverse TRAIL resistance of malignant lymphoma cells, thus supplying a theoretical base for reasonable administration.

77951721377	GADD45α mediates arsenite-induced cell apoptotic effect in human hepatoma cells via JNKs/AP-1-dependent pathway	Arsenite (As(III)), an effective chemotherapeutic agent for the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and multiple myeloma (MM), might be also a promise for the therapy of other cancers, including the solid tumors. However, the molecular bases of arsenite-induced cytotoxicity in the tumor cells have not been fully defined. In this study, we have disclosed that arsenite effectively induces the apoptotic response in the HepG2 human hepatoma cells by triggering GADD45α induction and the subsequent activation of JNKs/AP-1 cell death pathway. However, signaling events relating to GADD45α/JNKs/AP-1 pathway activation have not been observed in HL7702 human diploid hepatic cells under the same arsenite exposure condition. Our results thus have illustrated the selective pro-apoptotic role of arsenite in the hepatoma cells by activating GADD45α-dependent cell death pathway whereas with little effect on the normal hepatic cells. The approaches to up-regulate GADD45α levels might be helpful in improving the chemotherapeutic action of arsenite on certain solid tumors including hepatoma. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77952322937	Transactivators Zta and Rta of Epstein-Barr virus promote G0/G1 to S transition in Raji cells: A novel relationship between lytic virus and cell cycle	In the present study, we show that the treatment of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latently infected Raji cells with TPA/SB caused the cell growth arrest. The Zta-positive cells were predominantly enriched in G0/G1 phase of cell cycle. When Zta expression reached a maximal level, a fraction of Zta expressing cell population reentered S phase. Analysis of the expression pattern of a key set of cell cycle regulators revealed that the expression of Zta and Rta substantially interfered with the cell cycle regulatory machinery in Raji cells, strongly inhibiting the expression of Rb and p53 and inducing the expression of E2F1. Down-regulation of Rb was further demonstrated to be mediated by proteasomal degradation, and p53 and p21 affected at transcription level. The data indicate that both Zta and Rta promote entry into S phase of Raji cells. The important roles of Zta and Rta in EBV lytic reactivation were also demonstrated. Our finding suggests that these two transcriptional activators may act synergistically to govern the expression of downstream early and late genes as well as cellular genes and initiation of lytic cycle and manipulation of cell cycle regulatory mechanisms require the joint and interactive contributions of Rta and Zta. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77951950927	Clinical application of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in diagnosis of superficial lymphadenopathy	Objective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in differential diagnosis of superficial lymphadenopathy. Methods. Ninety-four superficial enlarged lymph nodes in 94 patients were studied by conventional ultrasonography (gray scale and color Doppler) and CEUS. Contrast-enhanced sonograms were analyzed using contrast-specific quantification software. All of the results were compared with pathologic diagnoses. Results. Of the 94 lymph nodes examined, 44 were benign and 50 were malignant (33 metastases and 17 lymphomas). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of conventional ultrasonography in differential diagnosis between benign and malignant nodes were 51%, 47%, and 55%, respectively. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography showed intense homogeneous enhancement in 39 of 44 benign lymph nodes, inhomogeneous enhancement in 32 of 33 metastases, and intense homogeneous enhancement and absence of perfusion in 9 of 17 and 6 of 17 lymphomas, respectively. The sensitivity specificity, and accuracy of CEUS were 84%, 79%, and 80%. After time-intensity curve gamma variates were calculated, the area under the curve of the benign lymph nodes was greater than those of the metastatic lymph nodes and lymphomas (P < .01). Conclusions. These results indicate that the use of CEUS and contrast-specific software has a higher degree of diagnostic accuracy than conventional ultrasonography for evaluations of superficial lymphadenopathy. The contrast enhancement patterns and timeintensity curves provide valuable diagnostic information for differential diagnosis of benign and malignant lymph nodes. © 2010 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

E24) and molecular docking method. Then the identified epitope of IgE was determined theoretically, which showed the key role of IgE-Cε3 in interacting with both FcεRIα and MAE11. By normal protocols, we immunized mice with purified protein E34 and screened six anti-E34 monoclonal antibodies. Purified antibodies could identify E34 by Western blot; furthermore, all of them could bind IgE by ELISA, in which QME5 seemed to be the best. Flow cytometry analysis displayed that only QME5 could bind membrane IgE and it could compete with membrane FcεRIα to bind soluble IgE. Meanwhile, QME5 couldn't bind FcεRIα-attached IgE, which suggested no hypersensitivity in triggering the target cells (mast cells or basophils) by crosslinking or inducing the release of a variety of chemical mediators.

77955613721	Percutaneous injection of hemostatic agents for active liver hemorrhage	BACKGROUND: Active hemorrhage arising from hepatic injury can be life-threatening and require immediate attention. At present, nonoperative management of abdominal solid organ injuries has become the usual method of care. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hemocoagulase injection alone guided by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) could control active bleeding in rabbit liver. METHODS: The livers of 30 rabbits were punctured with an 18-gauge semiautomatic biopsy needle to create an active bleeding liver model, which was confirmed with CEUS. The animals were randomly divided into two groups: a treatment group (n=15) and a control group (n=15). In the treatment group, hemocoagulase was injected into the bleeding site under CEUS guidance. In the control group, the active bleeding site was treated with normal saline. When these treatment procedures had been performed, lactated Ringer's solution was given to both groups to maintain the mean arterial pressure at 70 mmHg for 1 hour. The intraperitoneal blood loss, hematocrit, mean heart rate, and macroscopic and microscopic examinations were analyzed at the end of the study. RESULTS: CEUS showed hypoechoic and anechoic perfusion defects in active bleeding liver models. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations also supported the results. After the hemocoagulase injection, the former bleeding site appeared on CEUS as an area devoid of contrast. The blood loss was lower in the treatment group than in the control group (38.0±16.6 ml versus 107.9±20.8 ml; t=10.172, P<0.05). The mean hematocrit value and the heart rate were higher in the treatment group than in the control group (hematocrit: 23.9±3.8% versus 18.8±4.1%; t=3.541, P<0.05; heart rate: 250±18 versus 223±15; t=4.551, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Hemocoagulase injection alone under the guidance of CEUS is a simple and quick method to control blood loss in active liver bleeding. © 2010, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

77956191817	A comparative study of fibroid ablation rates using radio frequency or high-intensity focused ultrasound	This study compared the technical success of fibroid devascularization using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and radio frequency (RF) to provide an experimental basis for the clinical selection of a suitable, minimally invasive method for treating uterine fibroids. Patients were randomly divided into two groups and treated with HIFU or RF accordingly. The two groups of patients were divided again into subgroups A, B, and C based on fibroid diameter and subgroups A′, B′, and C′ based on fibroid blood supply grades. The fibroid diameters in subgroups A, B, and C were 2.0 cm ≤ D < 4.0 cm, 4.0 cm ≤ D<6.0 cm and 6.0 cm ≤ D<8.0 cm, respectively, and fibroid blood supplies were classified into three grades corresponding to subgroups A′, B′, and C′, respectively. The complete ablation rates of the two treatments were compared by contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Both treatments were effective, but the general complete ablation rate of RF was higher than that of HIFU (p < 0.05). The comparison between the two treatments in subgroup A and subgroup A′ showed that the complete ablation rate of HIFU was as good as that of RF (p > 0.05). In other subgroups, the complete ablation rates of RF were better than those of HIFU (p < 0.05). No severe complications were observed after these two treatments. RF can be applied for the majority of fibroids. As a noninvasive therapy, HIFU could be the preferred method for the treatment of small, hypovascular fibroids. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).

77957727097	Catecholamine up-regulates MMP-7 expression by activating AP-1 and STAT3 in gastric cancer	Background: Stress, anxiety and depression can cause complex physiological and neuroendocrine changes, resulting in increased level of stress related hormone catecholamine, which may constitute a primary mechanism by which physiological factors impact gene expression in tumors. In the present study, we investigated the effects of catecholamine stimulation on MMP-7 expression in gastric cancer cells and elucidated the molecular mechanisms of the up-regulation of MMP-7 level by catecholamine through an adrenergic signaling pathway.Results: Increased MMP-7 expression was identified at both mRNA and protein levels in the gastric cancer cells in response to isoproterenol stimulation. β2-AR antigonist effectively abrogated isoproterenol-induced MMP-7 expression. The activation of STAT3 and AP-1 was prominently induced by isoproterenol stimulation and AP-1 displayed a greater efficacy than STAT3 in isoproterenol-induced MMP-7 expression. Mutagenesis of three STAT3 binding sites in MMP-7 promoter failed to repress the transactivation of MMP-7 promoter and silencing STAT3 expression was not effective in preventing isoproterenol-induced MMP-7 expression. However, isoproterenol-induced MMP-7 promoter activities were completely disappeared when the AP-1 site was mutated. STAT3 and c-Jun could physically interact and bind to the AP-1 site, implicating that the interplay of both transcriptional factors on the AP-1 site is responsible for isoproterenol-stimulated MMP-7 expression in gastric cancer cells. The expression of MMP-7 in gastric cancer tissues was found to be at the site where β2-AR was overexpressed and the levels of MMP-7 and β2-AR were the highest in the metastatic locus of gastric cancer.Conclusions: Up-regulation of MMP-7 expression through β2-AR-mediated signaling pathway is involved in invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer. © 2010 Shi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Correlation of β2-AR level with Her2 status was demonstrated in breast cancer tissue samples. Constitutive phosphorylation of ERK, mRNA expression up-regulation of catecholamine-synthesis enzymes, and increased epinephrine release were detected in MCF-7/Her2 cells. β2-AR expression induced by epinephrine and involvement of ERK signaling were validated. The data indicate that Her2 overexpression and excessive phosphorylation of ERK cause epinephrine autocrine release from breast cancer cells, resulting in up-regulation of β2-AR expression. The data also showed that catecholamine prominently stimulated Her2 mRNA expression and promoter activity. The activation and nuclear translocation of STAT3 triggered by isoproterenol were observed. Enhanced binding activities of STAT3 to the Her2 promoter after isoproterenol stimulation were verified. Using STAT3 shRNA and dominant negative STAT3 mutant, the role of STAT3 in isoproterenol-induced Her2 expression was further confirmed. The data support a model where β2-AR and Her2 comprise a positive feedback loop in human breast cancer cells. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

However, overcoming drug resistance has become an important issue in cancer chemotherapy. In this study, we performed 2-DE and ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS analysis to identify differential proteins expression between cisplatin-sensitive (A2780S) and cisplatin-resistant (A2780-CP) ovarian cancer cell lines. Of the 14 spots identified as differentially expressed (±over twofold, P < 0.05) between the two cell lines, ten spots (corresponding to ten unique proteins) were positively identified by ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS analysis. These proteins include capsid glycoprotein, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2/B1, putative RNA-binding protein 3, Ran-specific GTPase-activating protein, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1, stathmin, ATPSH protein, chromobox protein homolog3 and phosphoglycerate kinase 1.

79955937126	Synergistic action of genistein and TRAIL in inducing apoptosis of human breast cancer MCF-7 Cells	Objective: To investigate the synergistic action and the potential internal mechanism of Genistein (Gen) combined with Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) in proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Methods: MCF-7 cells were treated with Gen at doses of 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40μg/mL and with TRAIL of 1, 10, 100 and 1000 ng/mL, respectively. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Based on the results of MTT, Gen (20 μg/mL) and TRAIL (100ng/mL) were administered for the follow-up tests. The MCF-7 cells were then divided into four groups: the control group, Gen (final concentration: 20 μg/mL) group, TRAIL (final concentration: 100n g/mL) group, and the combination group. After different treatment, apoptosis of MCF-7 cells was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). Caspase-3 activity was measured by immunofluorescence. And the expression of NF-κB was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: TRAIL-inhibited proliferation and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells were promoted by the combined use of Gen. The inhibition ratio reached 63.78% ± 2.61% and apoptotic rate was increased to 42.20% ± 1.35%, significantly higher than thoese in the group treated with TRAIL alome (P < 0.01). In addition, compared with TRAIL-treated cells, cells treated with Gen and TRAIL showed enhanced caspase-3 activity (44.000 ± 0.445 μmol/L). The content of NF-κB (177.453 ± 25.389 pg/mL) was significantly lower in the group treated with the combination therapy than in the group treated with TRAIL alone (343.333 ± 8.064 pg/mL) (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Gen can synergize TRAIL to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, thus increasing the sensitivity of TRAIL in MCF-7 cells. The mechanism might be that Gen has a synergistic action with TRAIL to activate caspase-3 and inhibit the formation of NF-κB, resulting in the apoptosis of MCF-7 cells.

79958176952	Elevated expression of CUEDC2 protein confers endocrine resistance in breast cancer	Endocrine resistance is a major obstacle to hormonal therapy for breast cancers. Although reduced expression of estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) is a known contributing factor to endocrine resistance, the mechanism of ER-α downregulation in endocrine resistance is still not fully understood. Here we report that CUE domain-"containing protein-2 (CUEDC2), a ubiquitin-binding motif-"containing protein, is a key factor in endocrine resistance in breast cancer. We show that CUEDC2 modulates ER-α protein stability through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Through the study of specimens from a large cohort of subjects with breast cancer, we found a strong inverse correlation between CUEDC2 and ER-α protein expression. Notably, subjects with tumors that highly expressed CUEDC2 had poor responsiveness to tamoxifen treatment and high potential for relapse. We further show that ectopic CUEDC2 expression impaired the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen. Therefore, our findings suggest that CUEDC2 is a crucial determinant of resistance to endocrine therapies in breast cancer. © 2011 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

79960990244	Cdk1-phosphorylated CUEDC2 promotes spindle checkpoint inactivation and chromosomal instability	Aneuploidy and chromosomal instability are major characteristics of human cancer. These abnormalities can result from defects in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which is a surveillance mechanism for accurate chromosome segregation through restraint of the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Here, we show that a CUE-domain-containing protein, CUEDC2, is a cell-cycle regulator that promotes spindle checkpoint inactivation and releases APC/C from checkpoint inhibition. CUEDC2 is phosphorylated by Cdk1 during mitosis. Depletion of CUEDC2 causes a checkpoint-dependent delay of the metaphase-anaphase transition. Phosphorylated CUEDC2 binds to Cdc20, an activator of APC/C, and promotes the release of Mad2 from APC/C-Cdc20 and subsequent APC/C activation. CUEDC2 overexpression causes earlier activation of APC/C, leading to chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy. Interestingly, CUEDC2 is highly expressed in many types of tumours. These results suggest that CUEDC2 is a key regulator of mitosis progression, and that CUEDC2 dysregulation might contribute to tumour development by causing chromosomal instability. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

81455128234	A preliminary clinical study on high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy for tubal pregnancy	Our aim was to explore the clinical application value of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy for tubal pregnancy. Forty hospitalized patients with tubal pregnancies (28 cases of non-ruptured tubal pregnancy and 12 cases of ruptured tubal pregnancy) were selected to receive HIFU therapy. Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) concentrations were compared before and after treatment. Serum β-HCG was measured weekly and patients received observation only if the concentration decreased by 15% or more, compared with the previous value. Patients were given supplement HIFU therapy if the decrease in the serum β-HCG was < 15% within two weeks. Ultrasound was used to detect the volume changes in the ectopic lesions before and after treatment, and changes in vital signs and complications were recorded. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was used to assess fallopian tube patency after treatment. HIFU treatment was successful in 33 of the 40 patients (82%). Seven patients failed HIFU treatment and received surgical therapy (18%). Before and after treatment, serum β-HCG concentrations and lesion volume were significantly different (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively). Posttreatment tubal contrast-enhanced ultrasonography showed tubal patency on the affected side in 21 cases (64%) at six months and in 27 cases (82%) at 12 months. In conclusion, HIFU is safe and effective, and can be a treatment option for tubal pregnancy.

84855287537	CUEDC2 (CUE domain-containing 2) and SOCS3 (suppressors of cytokine signaling 3) cooperate to negatively regulate Janus kinase 1/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 signaling	Janus kinase 1/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (JAK1/STAT3) pathway is one of the recognized oncogenic signaling pathways that frequently overactivated in a variety of human tumors. Despite rapid progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of activation of JAK/STAT pathway, the processes that regulate JAK/STAT deactivation need to be further clarified. Here we demonstrate that CUE domain-containing 2 (CUEDC2) inhibits cytokine-induced phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT3 and the subsequent STAT3 transcriptional activity. Further analysis by a yeast two-hybrid assay showed that CUEDC2 could engage in a specific interaction with a key JAK/STAT inhibitor, SOCS3 (suppressors of cytokine signaling 3). The interaction between CUEDC2 and SOCS3 is required for the inhibitory effect of CUEDC2 on JAK1 and STAT3 activity. Additionally, we found CUEDC2 functions collaboratively with SOCS3 to inhibit JAK1/STAT3 signaling by increasing SOCS3 stability via enhancing its association with Elongin C. Therefore, our findings revealed a new biological activity for CUEDC2 as the regulator of JAK1/STAT3 signaling and paved the way to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which SOCS3 has been linked to suppression of the JAK/STAT pathway. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

In this study, we used computer modeling to determine that the epitope of HER2 which the C-terminal 79 amino acids of herstatin (named HSTC79) binds is similar to that bound by 2C4. Based on these theoretical results, recombinant HSTC79 fused with GST was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Experimental analysis showed that HSTC79 did specifically bind to HER2 and that the epitope of HER2 identified by HSTC79 was near that identified by 2C4. Furthermore, HSTC79 inhibited the growth of HER2- overexpressing cells. These results highlight the fact that the binding site architecture and certain key residues of HER2 may be very helpful for understanding the protein's biological role and providing insights for designing novel inhibitors of HER2. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

84862806923	The left ventricular intracavitary vortex during the isovolumic contraction period as detected by vector flow mapping	Aims: The purpose of this study was to characterize left ventricular (LV) intracavitary flow during the isovolumic contraction (IVC) period in humans using vector flow mapping. Methods: Color flow Doppler imaging was performed from the apical long-axis view in 61 patients with heart failure and 58 healthy volunteers. Doppler flow data obtained during IVC were analyzed offline with vector flow mapping. Results: A large vortex was formed from the LV inflow toward the outflow during IVC. In normal subjects, the area of the vortex was sustained, but the flow volume decreased significantly during IVC (P < 0.001). A significant apex-to-base flow velocity gradient was shown along the outflow axis on aortic valve opening. However, both the area and flow volume of the vortex decreased more severely during IVC in the patients (P < 0.001). The apex-to-base flow velocity gradient along the outflow axis disappeared and a reversed velocity gradient was observed at the basal-mid level on aortic valve opening. In multivariate models, a decreased LV ejection fraction was the only independent predictor of the percentage decrease in area of the vortex during the IVC (P < 0.001), and a larger QRS width (P = 0.028) and LV end-systolic long diameter (P = 0.002) were independent predictors of the percentage decrease in flow volume of the vortex. Conclusions: The vortex across the LV inflow-outflow region during IVC facilitates the ejection of blood during early systole, and an unsustained vortex may be associated with impaired cardiac function.

84862972592	Modulation of IFN-γ receptor 1 expression by AP-2α influences IFN-γ sensitivity of cancer cells	Interferon (IFN)-γ plays crucial roles in regulating both innate and adaptive immunity. The existence of IFN-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) molecules on the cell surface is a prerequisite to the initiation of IFN-γ signaling; low expression of IFNGR1 leads to a functional blockade of IFN-γ signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms by which IFNGR1 expression is controlled are unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that IFNGR1 expression was reduced or lost in breast cancer. Heterogeneous IFNGR1 immunoreactivity appeared to be associated with the morphological heterogeneity of breast cancer, and loss of IFNGR1 expression was predominantly observed in poorly differentiated areas. We identified the functional activating protein (AP)-2 and specificity protein (SP)-1 sites within the IFNGR1 promoter. Ectopic expression of AP-2α drastically repressed the expression of IFNGR1 and hindered IFN-γ signaling, whereas AP-2α gene silencing elevated IFNGR1 levels. Overexpression of SP-1 effectively antagonized the repressive effects of AP-2α. Simultaneous recruitment of both transcription factors to the AP-2 and SP-1 motifs, respectively, in the IFNGR1 promoter was demonstrated, implying that AP-2α and SP-1 may synergistically modulate IFNGR1 transcription. Moreover, AP-2α overexpression in AP-2deficient SW480 cells remarkably inhibited Stat1 phosphorylation and the anti-proliferative effects of IFN-γ, whereas knockdown of the AP-2α expression dramatically enhanced the sensitivities of HeLa cells highly expressing AP-2 to IFN-γ, indicating that dysregulation of AP-2α expression is associated with impaired IFN-γ actions in cancer cells. © 2012 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

84863098455	Arg9 facilitates the translocation and downstream signal inhibition of an anti-HER2 single chain antibody	Background: HER2 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of many cancers and is linked to poor prognosis or cancer metastases. Monoclonal antibodies, such as Herceptin against HER2-overexpressing cancers, have showed satisfactory clinical therapeutic effect. However, they have difficulty to surmount obstacles to enter cells or blood-brain barrier. Results: In this study, a cell-penetrating peptide Arg9 was linked to the C-terminus of anti-HER2 single chain antibody (MIL5scFv). Flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and electron microscopy analysis all revealed that Arg9 peptide facilitated the penetration of MIL5scFv into HER2-negative cell line NIH3T3 and orientate in mitochondria. More interestingly, Western blot assay showed the potential enhanced bioactivity of MIL5scFv-Arg9 in HER2+ cell line SKOV3, indicating that Arg9 could help large molecules (e.g. antibody) to penetrate into cells and therefore enhance its anti-neoplastic function. Conclusions: Our work represented an attractive by preliminary strategy to enhance the therapeutic effect of existing antibodies by entering cells easier, or more desirable, surmounting the physical barriers, especially in hard-to-reach cancers such as brain metastases cases. © 2012 Hu et al.

84863230538	Establishment and identification of stable cell line secreting humen IgE Cε2-4 protein	Objective: To establish a stable cell line secreting human IgE Cε2-4 protein, and investigate the binding capacity of receptor FcεR I. Methods: The E24 gene was derived from SKO-007 cell line, and was then cloned into pcDNA3.1 (+) (signal peptides were synthesized and fused at the 5'-end of E24 gene) or pCMV-L vector. After transient transfection into 293T cell, the secreted E24 protein was analyzed by sandwich ELISA. The best vector was chosen to be transfected into CHO cells with LipofectAMINE™ 2000 reagent. After being selected by G418 and subcloned three times by limited-dilution method, two stable cell lines were established. E24 gene was amplified by RT-PCR, and the E24 protein in the supernatant was identified by ELISA. Besides, the binding capacity of FcεR I was analyzed by flow cytometry method. Results: Three mammalian expression vector SP-E24-P3.1, SP II-E24-P3.1 and E24-PL were constructed and transient transfected to 293T cells. The output of E24 protein in the supernatant were 19.1, 19.4 and 8.7 μg/ml, respectively. Then the vector SP II-E24-P3.1 was transfected into CHO cells. Finally, two single clones secreting E24 protein were stably obtained. The output of E24 were all at least 25 μg/ml. RT-PCR could detect the E24 gene from one of the two clones. Furthermore, flow cytometry results showed that E24 could bind the receptor in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: Two stable cell line secreting E24 protein were obtained, while E24 could specifically bind FcεR I.

84865061680	Synergistic effects of proteasome inhibitor on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in malignant lymphoma cells	Objective: To explore the synergistic mechanisms of proteasome inhibitor on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in malignant lymphoma cells and to offer new ideas for clinical treatment of drug- resistant tumors. Methods: The apoptosis index, Caspase- 3 activity and Bax protein level were detected in malignant lymphoma CRL cells using flow cytometry, Western blot and fluorometry. The CRL cells were treated with PS-341, with or without TRAIL. Results: The CRL cells were resistant to the TRAIL-induced apoptosis and the apoptosis rate of TRAIL-treated cells at 24 h was only 21.3% of the level found in untreated CRL cells. Bax protein was degraded during the PS-341 treatment and the Bax expression level at 6 h was 5/9 of the level found in untreated cells. The apoptosis index increased significantly when the working concentration reached 10 nmol/L PS-341. At that concentration, the apoptosis index at 24 h was 50.4%, and the expression of Bax protein was 1.2 times the level found in untreated cells. The Caspase-3 enzyme activity was increased to 122.56 ±1.434 μmol/L·h

84864683186	C-myb regulates cell cycle-dependent expression of erbin: An implication for a novel function of erbin	In the present study, we demonstrated the cell cycle periodicity of Erbin expression with the maximal expression of Erbin in G2/M phase. A significant increase in Erbin promoter activity was observed in G2/M phase-synchronized cells. Sequence analysis revealed a c-Myb site in the core promoter region of Erbin. Mutagenesis of c-Myb consensus sequences abrogated the increased Erbin promoter activity in G2/M phase. ChIP and oligonucleotide pull-down assays validated that the recruitment of c-Myb to the consensus sequences was specific. The interaction of c-Myb with c-Myb site in the Erbin promoter was significantly enhanced in G2/M phase. Ectopic overexpression of c-Myb led to the up-regulation of Erbin promoter activity and c-Myb silencing by small interfering RNA significantly decreased Erbin protein level. Transfection of c-Myb rescued Erbin expression that was impaired by c-Myb knockdown. It proves that c-Myb and the c-Myb response element mediate the cell cycle-dependent expression of Erbin. Inactivation of Erbin causes an acceleration of the G1/S transition, the formation of multipolar spindles and abnormal chromosome congression. These results unravel a critical role of c-Myb in promoting Erbin transcription in G2/M phase and also predict an unappreciated function of Erbin in cell cycle progression. © 2012 Liu et al.

84865390047	Forecast and analysis of long-term operation of ground source heat pump system	A simulation model was built for the thermodynamic system of the ground source heat pump (GSHP) based on the G-function theory of the underground heat exchanger (UGHE), and an analysis method for the long-term operation of the GSHP system was proposed. Taking the severe cold region as example, the system winter heating operation conditions in the last 3 years were studied. The fluid temperature variations at the inlet and the outlet of the UGHE, the coefficient of performance and the energy consumption of the heat pump and the system were analyzed simulationally and the results were compared with the measured data. The results show that the model and method are feasible, providing an effective approach for further forecast and analysis.

84865415804	Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α regulates chemotactic migration of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells through directly transactivating the CX3CR1 gene	CX3CR1 is an important chemokine receptor and regulates the chemotactic migration of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. Up to now, its regulatory mechanism remains largely undefined. Here, we report that hypoxia upregulates the expression of CX3CR1 in pancreatic cancer cells. When hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α expression was knocked down in vitro and in vivo, the expression of CX3CR1 was significantly decreased. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that HIF-1α bound to the hypoxia-response element (HRE; 5′-A/GCGTG-3′) of CX3CR1 promoter under normoxia, and this binding was significantly enhanced under hypoxia. Overexpression of HIF-1α significantly upregulated the expression of luciferase reporter gene under the control of the CX3CR1 promoter in pancreatic cancer cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that HIF-1α may regulate cancer cell migration through CX3CR1. The HIF-1α/CX3CR1 pathway might represent a valuable therapeutic target to prevent invasion and distant metastasis in PDAC. © 2012 Zhao et al.

84866248074	Glucocorticoid regulation of a novel HPV-E6-p53- MiR-145 pathway modulates invasion and therapy resistance of cervical cancer cells	Glucocorticoids are stress-responsive neuroendocrine mediators and play an important role in malignant progression, especially in solid tumours. We demonstrate a novel mechanism by which glucocorticoids modulate p53-dependent miR-145 expression in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells through induction of E6 proteins. We found that expression of miR-145 was reduced in cervical cancer tissues. Cortisol induced HPV-E6 expression and suppressed p53 and miR-145 in cervical cancer cells. MiR-145 expression in cervical cancer cells was wild-type p53-dependent, and cortisol-induced down-regulation of miR-145 expression prevented chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, whereas over-expression of miR-145 enhanced sensitivity to mitomycin and reversed the chemoresistance induced by glucocorticoids. We also show that miR-145 augments the effects of p53 by suppressing the inhibitors of p53 in cervical cancer cells, suggesting that miR-145 plays a role in p53 tumour suppression. Finally, we demonstrate that miR-145 inhibits both the motility and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Our findings identify a novel pathway through which the neuroendocrine macroenvironment affects cervical tumour growth, invasion and therapy resistance and show that miR-145 may serve as a target for cervical cancer therapy.

0037904750	A recombinant anti-erbB2, scFv-Fc-IL-2 fusion protein retains antigen specificity and cytokine function	Elevated erbB2 expression is detected in many in situ and invasive human ductal carcinomas. Anti-erbB2 antibody directed at the extracellular domain of erbB2 can result in an antitumor response in some patients with tumors overexpressing erbB2 oncoprotein. By combining interleukin 2 (IL-2) activities with a tumor specific antibody, immunotherapy of tumors might be more effective in the future. In this study, a fusion protein consisting of erbB2 single chain antibody (scFv), Fc fragment of human IgG1 and IL-2 was constructed. The molecular weight of fusion proteins is 66 kDa, only one third of whole antibody-IL-2 fusion protein or 44% whole Ig molecule. The fusion proteins retained the activities of both antigen binding and IL-2. The scFv-Fc-IL-2 fusion protein may have advantages over whole antibody-IL-2 fusion proteins, such as smaller molecule, better activity of penetration, more favorable pharmacokinetic properties.

84867921583	IL-17 and IL-22 in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma are elevated in Guillain-Barré syndrome	Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute autoimmune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease that causes rapidly progressing paralysis and occasionally respiratory failure. We hypothesized that interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 are elevated in GBS and participate in the autoimmune inflammatory response of GBS. We used sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the IL-17 and IL-22 levels in the CSF, and plasma from 22 GBS patients at the acute phase and 18 healthy controls (HC). The results show that CSF and plasma levels of IL-17 and IL-22 are elevated in GBS patients compared with HC. IL-17 and IL-22 levels in CSF, respectively, are correlated with GBS disability scale scores (GDSs). Meanwhile, IL-17 and IL-22 levels in CSF, IL-22 in CSF, and plasma of GBS patients have positive correlation, respectively. The increased levels of IL-17 and IL-22 in CSF may be explained by the disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) local inflammation in GBS. Meanwhile, the elevated levels of these two cytokines in plasma suggest the activation of Th17 and Th22 cells in the systemic immune response of GBS. Our data provide preliminary evidence that GBS is associated with high levels of IL-17 and IL-22 in CSF and plasma. These cytokines display pathogenic potential and may serve as useful biomarkers for GBS. © 2012 Shujuan Li et al.

Methods 250 Wistar rats were assigned randomly to four groups, normal control group (10 rats), sham operation group (80 rats), ICH group (80 rats) and sodium aescine treating group (80 water contents in perihematom and the expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein were measured respectively at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 120 h, 7 d and 15 d after operation in each group. Results Neurological function deficit in sodium aescine treating group was improved compared with ICH group in 6 h - 7 d <0.01 ∼ 0.05). The water contents in perihematoma in treating group were reduced than in ICH group at 6 h ∼ 120 h (P<0.01 ∼0.05). The expression of MMP-2 protein in ICH group peaked at 6 h, and decreased at 12 h, it different from normal control group ( all P < 0.01). The expression of MMP-2 protein in treating group was reduced than in ICH group at different time point (all P < 0.01), and the expression of MMP-9 protein reased at 6 h, peaked at 24h ∼ 48h, and decreased at 72 h, the change had statistic significance compared with normal control group ( all P < 0.01 ). These expressions of MMP-9 protein were positively correlated with water contents in perihematoma (r = 0. 949, P <0.05). The expression of MMP-9 protein in treating group was reduced in ICH group at different time point (all P < 0.01). Conclusions The expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein plays important roles in the brain edema at early and middle period after ICH. Sodium aescine may reduce the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein and decrease water contents in perihematoma. This drug may have protective effect to ICH.

84871597069	All-Trans-Retinoic Acid Modulates ICAM-1 N-Glycan Composition by Influencing GnT-III Levels and Inhibits Cell Adhesion and Trans-Endothelial Migration	Changes in the expression of glycosyltransferases directly influence the oligosaccharide structures and conformations of cell surface glycoproteins and consequently cellular phenotype transitions and biological behaviors. In the present study, we show that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) modulates the N-glycan composition of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) by manipulating the expression of two N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, GnT-III and GnT-V, via the ERK signaling pathway. Exposure of various cells to ATRA caused a remarkable gel mobility down-shift of ICAM-1. Treatment with PNGase F confirmed that the reduction of the ICAM-1 molecular mass is attributed to the decreased complexity of N-glycans. We noticed that the expression of the mRNA encoding GnT-III, which stops branching, was significantly enhanced following ATRA exposure. In contrast, the level of the mRNA encoding GnT-V, which promotes branching, was reduced following ATRA exposure. Silencing of GnT-III prevented the molecular mass shift of ICAM-1. Moreover, ATRA induction greatly inhibited the adhesion of SW480 and U937 cells to the HUVEC monolayer, whereas knock-down of GnT-III expression effectively restored cell adhesion function. Treatment with ATRA also dramatically reduced the trans-endothelial migration of U937 cells. These data indicate that the alteration of ICAM-1 N-glycan composition by ATRA-induced GnT-III activities hindered cell adhesion and cell migration functions simultaneously, pinpointing a unique regulatory role of specific glycosyltransferases in the biological behaviors of tumor cells and a novel function of ATRA in the modulation of ICAM-1 N-glycan composition. © 2012 Chen et al.

84872868296	PhosphogluSeparate and concurrent use of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and 3-bromopyruvate in pancreatic cancer cells	Unrestrained glycolysis characterizes energy metabolism in cancer cells. Thus, antiglycolytic reagents such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) and 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) may be used as anticancer drugs. In the present study, we examined the anticancer effects of 2-DG and 3-BrPA in pancreatic cancer cells and investigated whether these effects were regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a). To this end, 2-DG and 3-BrPA were administered to wild-type (wt) MiaPaCa2 and Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells that were incubated under hypoxic (HIF-1a-positive) or normoxic (HIF-1a-negative) conditions. In addition, 2-DG and 3-BrPA were also administered to si-MiaPaCa2 and si-Panc-1 cells that lacked HIF-1a as a result of RNA interference. Following drug exposure, cell population was measured using a viability assay. Both HIF-1a-positive and HIF-1a-negative MiaPaCa2 cells were further studied for their expression of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and for their contents of ATP and fumarate. In the viability assay, either 2-DG or 3-BrPA decreased the tested cells. Concurrent use of 2-DG and 3-BrPA resulted in a greater decrease of cells and also facilitated ATP depletion. In addition, 3-BrPA was seen to both decrease SOD1 and increase fumarate, which suggests that the reagent impaired the mitochondria. 3-BrPA also decreased both full-length PARP and cleaved PARP, which suggests that 3-BrPA-induced decrease in cell population was a result of cell necrosis rather than apoptosis. When HIF-1a was induced in wt-MiaPaCa2 cells by hypoxia, some effects of 2-DG and 3-BrPA were attenuated. We conclude that: i) concurrent use of 2-DG and 3-BrPA has better anticancer effects in pancreatic cancer cells, ii) 3-BrPA impairs the mitochondria of pancreatic cancer cells and induces cell necrosis, and iii) HIF-1a regulates the anticancer effects of 2-DG and 3-BrPA in pancreatic cancer cells.

84873270504	Effect of aquifer structure on water temperature evolution in field of pumping and injecting wells	The evolution of underground temperature field of the pumping and injecting wells area with different aquifer structures was investigated experimentally. The transport behavior of the thermal-wet of different aquifer media and their thermal interaction were analyzed under same total water flow rate and well geometric parameters. The experimental results showed that the effect of aquifer rockyness variation on the occurrence time of the thermal breakthrough is significant while relatively small on the later thermal interaction. For the aquifer with larger size of gravel, the thermal breakthrough advances significantly. The effect of aquifer distribution on the thermal breakthrough is less than thermal interaction. For the homogeneous aquifer medium, the water flow rate of each well should be evenly distributed to postpone the thermal breakthrough and weaker the thermal interaction. For the inhomogeneous aquifer medium, each well should have individual flow adjustment to improve the thermal-wet balance and avoid the adverse influence of aquifer in homogeneity.

Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the interaction between HIF-1α and CX3CR1 in tissue specimens of pancreatic cancer, and the effect of this interaction on peri-neural invasion (PNI). Then, HIF-1α and CX3CR1 gene were knocked down or overexpressed by the construction of siRNA duplexes/ plasmids to estimate their correlation. The reciprocal regulation of HIF-1α and CX3CR1 was assessed by Western blot assay. Results: HIF-1 a was involved in PNI in pancreatic cancer specimens. HIF-1α expression was correlated with clinicopathological parameters in pancreatic cancer patients. HIF-1α and CX3CR1 were correlatively expressed in human pancreatic cancer cell lines and tissue specimens, and both were associated with PNI in pancreatic cancer. Conclusion: The reciprocal regulation of HIF-1α and CX3CR1 modulates the neurotropism of pancreatic cancer.

84879974230	Deficiency of Erbin induces resistance of cervical cancer cells to anoikis in a STAT3-dependent manner	Epithelial cell polarization and integration are essential to their function and loss of epithelial polarity and tissue architecture correlates with the development of aggressive tumors. Erbin is a basolateral membrane-associated protein. The roles of Erbin in establishing cell polarization and regulating cell adhesion have been suggested. Erbin is also a negative regulator in Ras-Raf-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) signaling pathway. However, the potential functions of Erbin in human cancer are basically unknown. In the present study, we show, for the first time, that loss of Erbin endows cervical cancer cells with resistance to anoikis both in vitro and in vivo and promotes the growth and metastasis of human cervical cancer xenografts in nude mice. We found that knockdown of Erbin induced the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activities of signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) in cervical cancer cells. Overexpression of STAT3C or induction of endogenous STAT3 activation by interleukin (IL)-6 evidently inhibited anoikis of cervical cancer cells, whereas WP1066, a potent inhibitor of Janus-activated kinase 2 (Jak2)/STAT3, effectively blocked the effect of Erbin knockdown on cell survival under anchorage-independent conditions, indicating that loss of Erbin confers resistance of cervical cancer cells to anoikis in a STAT3-dependent manner. Interestingly, IL-6 induced STAT3 activation and Erbin expression simultaneously. Overexpression of STAT3C also significantly upregulated the level of Erbin, whereas the Jak2 inhibitor AG490 remarkably blocked not only STAT3 phosphorylation but also IL-6-induced Erbin expression. Knockdown of Erbin augmented the effects of IL-6 on STAT3 activation and anoikis resistance. In addition, by immunohistochemical analysis of Erbin expression, we demonstrate that the expression of Erbin is significantly decreased or even lost in cervical cancer tissues. These data reveal that Erbin is a novel negative regulator of STAT3, and the IL-6/STAT3/Erbin loop has a crucial role in cervical cancer progression and metastasis. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84880739339	Experimental study on interaction between soil and ground heat exchange pipe at low temperature	In the application of ground source heat pump (GSHP) in cold regions, soil-pipe interaction due to frost heave can lead to many problems influencing the system efficiency. The aim of this experimental study is to investigate the characteristics of soil-pipe interaction and test the feasibility of reducing the pipe deformation by increasing the grain size of soil in backfill. In this study, two types of soils with different grain sizes are used, the movement of freezing front, the pipe deformation and the freezing soil pressure on pipe are analysed. The results indicate that the U-pipe can result in an asymmetrical soil freezing area around it, the pipe's cross-section changes to be more and more elliptical, the soil pressure on pipe increases. An obvious reduction in the pipe deformation and the soil pressure on pipe can be shown in the soil with larger grain size, and the application of suitable large-grain soils in backfill is helpful to reduce the pipe deformation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84881303278	Stat3-coordinated Lin-28-let-7-HMGA2 and miR-200-ZEB1 circuits initiate and maintain oncostatin M-driven epithelial-mesenchymal transition	Inflammation can act as a crucial mediator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we show that oncostatin M (OSM) is expressed in an autocrine/paracrine fashion in invasive breast carcinoma. OSM stimulation promotes spontaneous lung metastasis of MCF-7 xenografts in nude mice. A conspicuous epigenetic transition was induced by OSM stimulation not only in breast cancer cell lines but also in MCF-7 xenografts in nude mice. The expression of miR-200 and let-7 family members in response to OSM stimulation was downregulated in a signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (Stat3)-dependent manner, resulting in comprehensive alterations of the transcription factors and oncoproteins targeted by these microRNAs. Inhibition of Stat3 activation or the ectopic expression of let-7 and miR-200 effectively reversed the mesenchymal phenotype of breast cancer cells. Stat3 promotes the transcription of Lin-28 by directly binding to the Lin-28 promoter, resulting in the repression of let-7 expression and concomitant upregulation of the let-7 target, high-mobility group A protein 2 (HMGA2). Knock down of HMGA2 significantly impairs OSM-driven EMT. Our data indicate that downregulation of let-7 and miR-200 levels initiates and maintains OSM-induced EMT phenotypes, and HMGA2 acts as a master switch of OSM-induced EMT. These findings highlight the importance of Stat3-coordinated Lin-28B-let-7-HMGA2 and miR-200-ZEB1 circuits in the cytokine-mediated phenotypic reprogramming of breast cancer cells. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84881476799	β2-AR-induced Her2 transactivation mediated by Erbin confers protection from apoptosis in cardiomyocytes	Background: Her2 and β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) can form a heterocomplex in cardiomyocytes and agonists can induce Her2 transactivation, which is important for cardiovascular homeostasis. The scaffolding molecules that mediate β2-AR/Her2 interaction are currently unknown. Erbin, a PDZ domain-containing protein is a binding partner of Her2. The C-terminus of β2-AR harbors a PDZ domain-binding motif. Hypothesis of this study is that Erbin may organize the assembly of β2-AR/Her2 complex. Methods: The interaction among β2-AR, Her2 and Erbin was investigated in COS-7, HEK-293 and H9c2 cells and rat brain and heart tissues by coimmunoprecipitation. The β2-AR binding region of Erbin was identified by utilizing the Erbin deletion mutants. The functional significance of Erbin in cardiomyocytes was determined by Erbin silencing, contraction frequency measurement and cellular apoptosis assays. Results: Erbin was able to form a complex with both exogenous and endogenous β2-AR and Her2 in the presence of isoproterenol (ISO). Deletion of the Erbin LRR domain did not affect its binding to β2-AR and Her2, whereas lacking of the PDZ domain lost the ability of Erbin. Silencing of Erbin greatly abrogated ISO-induced activation of ERK. The treatment of H9c2 cells transfected with the Erbin siRNA with ISO caused severe cell apoptosis. Knock-down of Erbin expression in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes led to a remarkable reduction of the beating frequency after ISO stimulation.

84883145351	Microstructural evolution and hardening of subsurface of Mg-3AL-1Zn alloy during dry sliding wear	Dry sliding tests were performed on as-cast AZ31 alloy using a pin-on-disc configuration within a load range of 5-360N at a sliding velocity of 0.8 m/s. Worn surface morphologies were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Wear mechanisms, namely abrasion, oxidation, delamination, thermal softening and melting, have been observed in different load ranges. Surface hardness, subsurface plastic deformation and worn surface temperature were used to characterize the microstructure evolution and hardness change in subsurface. The results reveal that in the lower load range of 5-120N, surface hardening originating from large plastic deformation plays the important role in keeping a mild wear, in the higher load range of 120-360N, surface softening originating from dynamic recrystallization and surface melting are responsible for severe wear. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84884257867	The CX3CL1/CX3CR1 reprograms glucose metabolism through HIF-1 pathway in pancreatic adenocarcinoma	One of the hallmarks of cancer is revised glucose metabolism that promotes cell survival and proliferation. In pancreatic cancer, the regulatory mechanism of glucose metabolism remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found that CX3CR1 is expressed in pancreatic cancer cells lines. Exogenous or transfected CX3CL1 increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion. CX3CL1 stimulated HIF-1 expression through PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways. Furthermore, knockdown of HIF-1 blocked CX3CL1-modified glucose metabolism in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. In conclusion, the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 reprograms glucose metabolism through HIF-1 pathway in pancreatic cancer cells. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84885333519	Experiment and numerical simulation study of thermal deformation for underground heat exchanger structure	Numerical calculation analysis and experimental study were carried out for the thermal deformation of unground heat exchanger structure.Finite element method was used in the study of thermal strain and deformation in underground heat exchanger with vertical heat exchange pipe, a series of experiments were used for verifying numerical method. By means of describing the material constitutive and building geometric model, a numerical calculation method for thermal deformation and thermal strain of underground heat exchanger structure was proposed. The study focused on the thermal deformations of heat exchange pipes with different initial bending forms and thermal extrusion for the backfill material contact surface. The displacement characteristics of feature boundary in backfill material and the plastic strain distribution in the cross section were obtained. This fundamental study can be beneficial to the further study on thermal gap phenomenon of backfill material and heat transfer reduction of underground heat exchanger system.

84885955797	Numerically simulating the thermal behaviors in groundwater wells of groundwater heat pump	In the geothermal energy utilization of a closed loop groundwater system of a GWHP (groundwater heat pump) and an ATES (aquifer thermal energy storage), thermal breakthrough is a very important aspect in the design of these systems. It can cause a gradual variation in the temperature of the pumping water and impact the efficiency of the GWHP. For pumping and injecting well groups, the influence of groundwater flow on the heat transfer is particularly important, especially for the aquifers with high porosity and hydraulic conductivity, the direction and velocity of groundwater directly affects the underground temperature field evolution. In this research, heat-water transfer numerical simulation and experiment has been conducted to study the evolution rule between aquifer temperature field and groundwater flow field. Simulation results were compared with the experimental results, and the validity of the simulation model was confirmed. Furthermore, the effects of groundwater flow on pumping average temperature and thermal breakthrough have been estimated by the numerical analysis, which will serve as a basis for the engineering design and further study of GWHP system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84886801778	Expression of CIDE proteins in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and their prognostic significance	Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the major and aggressive subtype of renal cell carcinoma. It is known to derive its histologic appearance from accumulation of abundant lipids and glycogens. The cell deathinducing DFF45-like effector (CIDE) family has been characterized as the lipid droplet proteins involved in the metabolism of lipid storage droplets. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of CIDE proteins in ccRCC cells and to investigate their prognostic significance. We examined consecutive patients with sporadic ccRCC, who underwent nephrectomy, to measure their mRNA and protein expression of CIDE proteins. We found that Cidec and ADRP expression were significantly upregulated in ccRCC, compared with normal kidney tissues. Cideb was down-regulated. We also found that Cideb was expressed more in low-grade ccRCC than in high-grade tumors. To further clarify the relationship between Cideb expression and patient prognosis, we evaluated 57 ccRCC patients followed up for 120 months. Reduced ccRCC Cideb expression was associated with a higher Fuhrman nuclear grade. Patients with high Cideb expression had better overall survival rate than those with low expression (p<0.05). Cideb expression was an independent predictor of survival (p = 0.001). Although the biologic function of Cideb in ccRCC remains unknown, the expression level of Cideb might be a novel predictor of prognosis in ccRCC.

0043238156	Activation of protein kinase ERK mediates protiferative effect of IFN-α on human myeloma cell line U266	Objective To investigate the biological activity and molecular mechanism of IFN-α on human myeloma cell line U266. Methods The effect of IFN-α on the growth of U266 cells was measured by MTT assay; U266 cells cycle distribution and the expression of JL-6R. and gp130 on the cell surface in the absence or presence of IFN-α were monitored by FACS analysis. Immunoblot assay was used in U266 cells stimulated by IFN-α to detect the activation of protein kinase ERK, that is involved in Ras/MAPK signal transduction pathway mediating cell survival and proliferation. Then the changes on U266 cells proliferation and ERK activation induced by IFN-α were examined in the presence of PD98059, the specific antagonist of Ras/MAPK pathway. Results IFN-α promoted cell cycle progression and proliferation of U266 cells, but it did not show any effect on the expression of IL-6R and gp130 on cell surface. ERK was activated in U266 cells stimulated by IFN-α, but both cell proliferation and ERK activation were obviously inhibited in the presence of PD98059. Conclusion The proliferative effect of IFN-α on U266 cells is mediated by activation of protein kinase ERK.

0042814832	Preparation and function assay of monoclonal antibodies against human CD20 by recombinant CD20 antigen	Objective To obtain monoclonal antibodies (McAb) against human CD20. Mothods BALB/c mice were immunized with CD20-expressing NIH-3T3 cells. The spleen cells of immunized mice were used to prepare the McAb by hybridoma techniques. CD20-McAb was selected by indirect immunofluorescence experiments on Daudi cells with cultural supernatant of hybridoma cells. Immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry (FCM) analysis were used to identify the surface molecules on Daudi cells recognized by the prepared antibody. Apoptosis assay and cell proliferation inhibition were examined by MTT, FCM and microscopy. Results A monoclonal antibody against CD20(1-28) was produced. The antibody recognized 33kD molecules on the surface of Daudi cells. FCM analysis indicated that 1-28 accorded with CD20-McAb in specific reaction with cell lines. Functional assay revealed that 1-28 could markedly inhibited the growth of Daudi cells and Raji cells, induced apoptosis of Daudi cells. Conclusion A hybridoma cell line 1-28 secreting CD20-McAb stably was obtained by recombinant CD20 antigen, and the CD20-McAb inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of CD20 positive cells.

0141843558	Enhanced heat transfer for increasing utilization of ground energy	Underground frame is a gigantic resource of renewable energy which absorbs solar energy and is a heating or cooling storage body. Ground Source Heat Pump (GSPIP) are recognized to be a outstanding heating and cooling system to use the ground energy. This paper described efforts recently undertaken to explore heat transfer enhancement of ground heat exchangers, in vertical boreholes (100 m,200 m deep) of closed-loop GSHP in a testing field. A new technology of the screw core tube bundle in ground heat exchangers was presented to disturb the flow and enhance heat transfer, and experimental results show both increase of heat transfer to and from the ground loop heat exchanger. A method of using intermittent process to make better use of ground energy and to decrease the number of the heat transfer well in GSHP system and to keep better working condition of GSHP was presented.

0043025615	Lineage-dependent NF-κB activation contributes to the resistance of human macrophages to apoptosis	Granulocytes and mononuclear phagocytes develop from the same myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow via distinct differentiation pathways. Yet, it is known that mature macrophages are more resistant than granulocytes to spontaneous apoptosis in cultures without hematopoietic growth factors. This fact suggests that the development of resistance to apoptosis during myeloid differentiation is differentially regulated by a lineage-dependent mechanism. Using primary cultures of human bone marrow cells, we now report that induction of monocytic differentiation into mature macrophages with M-CSF was correlated with a steady and gradual increase in the levels of X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apotosis (XIAP) and Bcl-2, while induction of granulocytic differentiation with G-CSF had no significant effects on the expression of these proteins. Consistent with this, NF-κB activation is linked to monocytic, but not granulocytic differentiation, while ERK or STAT3 activation is not lineage-dependent. Blockade of NF-κB activation in mature macrophages resulted in a marked decrease in the levels of XIAP and Bcl-2, which was accompanied with cell death through an apoptotic mechanism. Thus lineage-dependent activation of NF-κB is responsible at least in part for the resistance of mature macrophages to 'spontaneous' apoptosis in vitro.

0242362829	A trivalent anti-erbB2/anti-CD16 bispecific antibody retargeting NK cells against human breast cancer cells	Bispecific antibody (BsAb) can physically cross-link immune cells to tumor cells, circumventing the proper structures for tumor cell-immune cell interactions and activating the cellular cytotoxic mechanisms. The optimal BsAb should target tumor cells with high affinity, but activate trigger molecules on cytotoxic cells by monovalent binding of Fab fragments. In the present study, a trivalent anti-erbB2/anti-CD16 BsAb was produced. This BsAb possesses bivalent arms specifically binding to the extracellular domain of erbB2 and monovalent Fab fragment redirecting NK cells. The recombinant protein could be expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as native proteins without refolding. It was fully functional in bispecific binding to SKBR3 and NK cells. The molecular size of this trivalent BsAb protein is larger than diabody and smaller than whole antibody and expected to have advantages for both high penetration of small antibody fragments and the slow circulation clearance of whole antibody. This novel protein may be an attractive target for further improvement and evaluation. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84889012246	Role of the Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha induced autophagy in the conversion of non-stem pancreatic cancer cells into CD133+ pancreatic cancer stem-like cells	The initiation and progression of various solid tumors, including pancreatic carcinoma, are driven by a population of cells with stem cell properties, namely cancer stem cells (CSCs). Like their normal counterparts, CSCs are also believed to rely on their own microenvironment termed niches to sustain the population. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a major actor in the cell survival response to hypoxia. Recently, several researchers proposed that non-stem cancer cells can convert to stem-like cells to maintain equilibrium. The present study focuses on whether non-stem pancreatic cancer cells can convert to stem-like cells and the role of HIF-1α and autophagy in modulating this conversation. The non-stem pancreatic cancer cells and pancreatic cancer stem-like cells were separated by magnetic sorting column. Intermittent hypoxia enhanced stem-like properties of non-stem pancreatic cancer cells and stimulated the levels of HIF-1α, LC3-II and Beclin. Enhanced autophagy was associated with the elevated level of HIF-1α. The conversation of non-stem pancreatic cancer cells into pancreatic cancer stem-like cells was induced by HIF-1α and autophagy. This novel finding may indicate the specific role of HIF-1α and autophagy in promoting the dynamic equilibrium between CSCs and non-CSCs. Also, it emphasizes the importance of developing therapeutic strategies targeting cancer stem cells as well as the microenvironmental influence on the tumor. © 2013 Zhu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84889828474	Changes of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signaling and the effect of cilostazol in chronic cerebral ischemia	Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and its specific target gene heme oxygenase-1, are involved in acute cerebral ischemia. However, very few studies have examined in detail the changes in the hypox-ia-inducible factor-1/heme oxygenase-1 signaling pathway in chronic cerebral ischemia. In this study, a rat model of chronic cerebral ischemia was established by permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, and these rats were treated with intragastric cilostazol (30 mg/kg) for 9 weeks. Morris water maze results showed that cognitive impairment gradually worsened as the cerebral ischemia proceeded. Immunohistochemistry, semi-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis showed that hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and heme oxygenase-1 expression levels in-creased after chronic cerebral ischemia, with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression peaking at 3 weeks and heme oxygenase-1 expression peaking at 6 weeks. These results suggest that the elevated levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α may upregulate heme oxygenase-1 expression fol-lowing chronic cerebral ischemia and that the hypoxia-inducible factor-1/heme oxygenase-1 sig-naling pathway is involved in the development of cognitive impairment induced by chronic cerebral ischemia. Cilostazol treatment alleviated the cognitive impairment in rats with chronic cerebral ischemia, decreased hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and heme oxygenase-1 expression levels, and reduced apoptosis in the frontal cortex. These findings demonstrate that cilostazol can protect against cognitive impairment induced by chronic cerebral ischemic injury through an anti-apoptotic mechanism.

84890990601	Effect of microstructural evolution and hardening in subsurface on wear behavior of Mg-3Al-1Zn alloy	Dry sliding tests were performed on as-cast AZ31 alloy using a pin-on-disc configuration. Coefficient of friction and wear rate were measured within a load range of 5-360 N at a sliding velocity of 0.785 m/s. Worn surface morphologies were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Five wear mechanisms, namely abrasion, oxidation, delamination, thermal softening, melting, have been observed. Surface hardness, subsurface plastic strain, worn surface temperature, cross-sectional optical microscopy were used to characterize hardness change, plastic deformation, the microstructure evolution in subsurface. The results illustrate the correlation between the wear behavior and evolution of microstructure and hardness in subsurface, reveal that in the load range of 5-120 N, surface oxidation and hardening originating from large plastic deformation play an important role in maintaining the mild wear, softening originating from dynamic recrystallization in subsurface and surface melting are responsible for the severe wear in the load range of 120-360 N. © 2013 ASM International.

84899479441	Assessment of left ventricular myocardial systolic acceleration in diabetic rats using velocity vector imaging	Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate how the myocardial acceleration during isovolumic contraction changed in rats with diabetic cardiomyopathy and a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by using velocity vector imaging. Methods-Velocity vector imaging was performed in 12 control rats and 15 rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy 12 weeks after streptozotocin injection. The segmental radial displacement, velocity, acceleration, and percent wall thickening were measured at the mid-left ventricular (LV) level. Results: Compared to control rats, rats with cardiomyopathy had a significant decrease in the peak radial acceleration during isovolumic contraction in most segments of the LV wall (including the anterior, anterolateral, inferolateral, and inferior segments; P <.05) but a similar LVEF, fractional shortening, and segmental displacement. Rats with cardiomyopathy also had a significant increase in LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters when corrected for body mass (P <.001; P =.003, respectively) and a significant decrease in the radial peak systolic velocities of the inferolateral and inferior wall segments (P <.05). In addition, rats with cardiomyopathy had a significant decrease in the peak radial diastolic acceleration in most segments of the LV wall (except for the anterolateral one; P<.05) but similar peak radial diastolic velocities in all LV wall segments compared to controls. Pathologic examination in rats with cardiomyopathy revealed ultrastructural impairment of the capillary and cardiocyte without any atherosclerotic lesion in the coronary artery compared to control rats. Conclusions: Myocardial acceleration during isovolumic contraction decreases in rats with diabetic cardiomyopathy and a preserved LVEF, suggesting the presence of regional LV systolic dysfunction. © 2014 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

84904201561	Pipe-soil gap induced by thermal deformation of ground heat exchange pipe	The geometrical model of typical plane bending state of heat exchange pipe and the constitutive model are established. Then the thermal deformation characteristics of pipe-soil structure in heat transfer at different temperatures are analyzed. It is focused on the influence of typical initial thermal deformation of bending pipe on the development of pipe-soil gap evolution. Results show that larger pipe-soil gap appears in the concave side of the bending heat exchange pip. The gap distribution around the buried pipe is about half of the pipe perimeter. The larger gap of smaller bending deflection or no bending heat exchange pipe mainly appears at the corresponding area between two pipes of U-type heat exchange pipe. The magnitude of pipe-soil gap increases with the bending degree of the heat exchange pipe.

84906847822	Autophagy promotes paclitaxel resistance of cervical cancer cells: Involvement of Warburg effect activated hypoxia-induced factor 1-α-mediated signaling	Paclitaxel is one of the most effective chemotherapy drugs for advanced cervical cancer. However, acquired resistance of paclitaxel represents a major barrier to successful anticancer treatment. In this study, paclitaxel-resistant HeLa sublines (HeLa-R cell lines) were established by continuous exposure and increased autophagy level was observed in HeLa-R cells. 3-Methyladenine or ATG7 siRNA, autophagy inhibitors, could restore sensitivity of HeLa-R cells to paclitaxel compared with parental HeLa cells. To determine the underlying molecular mechanism, differentially expressed proteins between HeLa and HeLa-R cells were identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight MS/MS.We found glycolysis-associated proteins were upregulated in HeLa-R cell lines. Inhibition of glycolysis by 2-deoxy-D-glucose or koningic acid could decrease autophagy and enhance sensitivity of HeLa-R cells to paclitaxel. Moreover, glycolysis could activate HIF1-α. Downregulation of HIF1-α by specific siRNA could decrease autophagy and resensitize HeLa-R cells to paclitaxel. Taken together, a possible Warburg effect activated HIF1-α-mediated signaling-induced autophagic pathway is proposed, which may provide new insight into paclitaxel chemoresistance. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84906955364	Experimental research on deformation of ground heat exchange pipe due to frost heave	Experimental research was conducted on the condition of ground heat exchange pipe working below 0℃, to investigate pipe deformation due to soil frost heave. This experiment took the U-pipe as an example, on the basis of temperature change mode, to study the characteristics of soil freezing area development and pipe's cross-section deformation by means of freezing front tracking and strains measurement. Meanwhile, the influence of pipe's initial deformation in the course of frost heave was analysed. The results show that the soil freezing area develops asymmetrically, and its development speed decreases gradually. The pipe's cross-section manifests ovalisation under the effect of asymmetrical freezing area. The degree of pipe deformation increases with the expansion of freezing area, and its increasing speed decreases gradually. The pipe's initial deformation can make the subsequent deformation increase in the course of frost heave.

84907513663	Adrenergic signaling promotes angiogenesis through endothelial cell-tumor cell crosstalk	Angiogenesis is an important factor in invasive tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. Multiple proangiogenic mechanisms are involved in tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we showed that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine upregulated VEGF (VEGFA) expression in breast cancer cells and that the culture supernatant from norepinephrine-treated breast cancer cells promoted the formation of the capillary-like network of endothelial cells. However, the effects of norepinephrine were further enhanced when the endothelial cells were cocultured with breast cancer cells, indicating a critical role of tumor cell-endothelial cell contacts in norepinephrine-induced tumor angiogenesis. Interestingly, norepinephrine dramatically induced the activation of the Notch pathway, which is a cell-contact-mediated intercellular signaling pathway and tightly linked to tumor cell-stromal cell interaction and angiogenesis, in the endothelial cells that had been cocultured with breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the expression of the Notch ligand Jagged 1 was significantly upregulated by norepinephrine at both mRNA and protein levels in breast cancer cells. Inhibitors of β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), protein kinase A (PKA), and mTOR could reverse norepinephrine-induced Jagged 1 upregulation, indicating that the β2-AR-PKA-mTOR pathway participates in this process. Knockdown of Jagged 1 expression in breast cancer cells not only repressed norepine-phrine-induced activation of the Notch pathway in cocultured endothelial cells but also evidently impaired the effects of norepinephrine on capillary-like sprout formation. These data demonstrate that tumor angiogenesis mediated by the Jagged 1/Notch intercellular signaling is governed by the norepinephrine-activated β2-AR-PKA-mTOR pathway.

84909994509	Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α directly activates leptin receptor (Ob-R) in pancreatic cancer cells	The aim of this study is to investigate the regulatory mechanism of leptin receptors (Ob-R) in pancreatic cancer. We found that the over-expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1)α and hypoxia up-regulated the expression of Ob-R in pancreatic cancer cells. When HIF-1α gene was silenced in vitro, the expression of Ob-R was significantly decreased. Xenograft mouse models showed that the inhibition of HIF-1α resulted in the concomitant decrease of Ob-R in vivo. In addition, HIF-1α expression was correlated with Ob-R in pancreatic cancer tissues by immunohistochemical staining. Clinical data showed that over-expression of HIF-1 was associated with pathological tumor node metastasis stage, lymph node metastasis and overall survival. HIF-1α directly bound to the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) located in Ob-R gene promoter (-828/-832) and activated the transcription. Finally, we demonstrated that the silence of HIF-1α gene reversed the inhibitory effect of leptin/Ob-R in pancreatic cancer cells. Taken together, our results indicate that HIF-1α directly regulated Ob-R expression in pancreatic cancer, which might be a valuable therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.

0347285239	Structural analysis of the epitopes on erbB2 interacted with inhibitory or non-inhibitory monoclonal antibodies	erbB2 oncogene encodes a growth factor receptor. The overexpression of erbB2 was correlated with more aggressive tumors and a poorer prognosis. Some antibodies directed to this molecule have an antitumor effect in vivo, but some antibodies do not. In an attempt to understand the molecular basis of the anti-erbB2 antibody interaction with erbB2 ectodomain (ECD), we analyzed binding epitopes on erbB2 for inhibitory and non-inhibitory antibodies, Herceptin and HF by computer-guided protein engineering and site-directed mutagenesis. Two different interaction domains were identified by molecular docking, computer graphics and distance geometry method and confirmed through studies on a series of mutants of erbB2 ECD. Non-inhibitory antibody HF only recognized N-terminal portion of erbB2 ECD, but inhibitory antibody Herceptin bound to C-terminal portion of it exclusively. The region interacted with inhibitory antibody Herceptin can be an important target for anticancer therapies. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The resulting Myr-FKBP12-Fas fusion gene was subcloned into pEGFP-N1. Stable cell clones as named 293/ FKBP12-Fas were obtained by transfecting the recombinant plasmid pEGFP-N1/FKBP12-Fas into HEK293, which was following selected by G418. The integration and expression of FKBP12-Fas fusion gene were identified by RT-PCR and Western-blotting respectively. Both the observation of the condensation and margination of the chomatin on nuclear membrane under electron microscopy and the detection of typical "DNA Ladder" proved the apoptosis induced by AP20187. However, FK506 could competitively block such cell apoptosis, indicating that the inducible apoptosis cell model established as above offered an applicable technical platform for the screening of FK506-like small molecular compounds.

10344232013	A novel eIF5A complex functions as a regulator of p53 and p53-dependent apoptosis	Although eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) was originally designated as an "initiation factor," recent data have shown it to be also involved in apoptosis. However, the actual function of eIF5A in apoptosis is still unknown. In this study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens to identify eIF5A-interacting proteins to help us understand the mechanisms of eIF5A. Our results demonstrated that eIF5A and syntenin could engage in a specific interaction both in vitro and in vivo and functioned collaboratively to regulate p53 activity. Our findings, for the first time, revealed a new biological activity for eIF5A as the regulator of p53. Overexpression of eIF5A or its EFP domain resulted in up-regulation of p53, and silencing eIF5A by small interfering RNA reduced the p53 protein level. Further analysis by reverse transcription PCR showed eIF5A-activated p53 transcription. The effect of eIF5A on p53 transcriptional activity was further demonstrated by the increasing expressions of p21 and Bax, well known target genes of p53. In contrast, a point mutant of eIF5A, hypusination being abolished, was revealed to be functionally defective in p53 up-regulation. Overexpression of eIF5A led to a p53-dependent apoptosis or sensitized cells to induction of apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents. However, when eIF5A interacted with its novel partner, syntenin, the eIF5A-induced increase in p53 protein level was significantly inhibited. Therefore, eIF5A seems to be a previously unrecognized regulator of p53 that may define a new pathway for p53-dependent apoptosis, and syntenin might regulate p53 by balancing the regulation of eIF5A signaling to p53 for apoptosis.

12944312223	A new format of bispecific antibody: Highly efficient heterodimerization, expression and tumor cell lysis	Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) have been considered as potential therapeutics for cancer. A major obstacle in the development of BsAb has been the difficulty in producing a heterodimer with two different arms and in sufficient quantity for clinical application by the traditional methods. We describe a new format of BsAb that consists of two single-chain variable fragment of antibodies (scFvs), one for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu and the other for CD16, heterodimerized by a "knobs-into- holes" device from the CH3 domains of the human IgG1 Fc fragment. The two chains were functionally expressed in CHO cells and assembled into heterodimers with dual antigen-binding specificity. Compared with other types of engineered BsAbs expressed in mammalian cells, the yield of this BsAb was relatively high (12-14 mg/l). In vitro experiments demonstrated that the BsAb was able to recruit human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to kill SK-BR-3 cells more effectively than the commercial anti-HER2/neu antibody Herceptin® (Roche, Shanghai). This new format of BsAb possesses properties that support its potential as a new antitumor agent. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
